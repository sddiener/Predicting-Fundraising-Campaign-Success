<p>The Federal Nigeria Society for the Blind  (FNSB) was established in 1955 is a voluntary non-governmental organization set up to rehabilitate and train people who go blind in adolescence or adulthood. In 1956, The Society established a Vocational Training Centre for the Blind in Oshodi with the primary objective of providing an institution to educate and empower visually impaired people, giving them opportunities to pursue their various ambitions either academically or through entrepreneurial training</p>
<p>Many of our trainees come from low income households with no understanding of what to do next after vision loss. </p>
<p>Contributing to the Sponsor-a-trainee program affords the Society the opportunity to keep impacting the lives of our various trainees especially those that cannot afford to fund themselves even with our subsidized rates. We have many students who stop coming to school because they do not have any sponsors. With your generous donations, we can afford to give out need based scholarships to as many trainees as possible.</p>
<p>Being an NGO that relies solely on donations from organizations and individuals we requiure all the support that we get to keep on providing quality educational and vocational training for our trainees.</p>
<p>Our primary focus now is on providing quality training for our students.  The cost of training a blind/visually impaired person in the Center is <strong>N750, 000.00 (Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira). This includes assistive technology, feeding, accommodation and tuition.</strong> In reality however, ninety percent (90%) of our trainees come from economically disadvantaged back-grounds, and are unable to meet up with this cost.  <strong>We therefore subsidize our fees and charge N150, 000.00 (One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira</strong>) per trainee per annum. This leaves us with a considerable gap of N600, 000.00 (Six Hundred Thousand Naira) which is bridged from donations/sponsorships from individuals and Organizations as mentioned above.</p>
<p>We equip our trainees by teaching them to read and write braille, computer literacy, typewriting, mobility, daily living and vocational skills such as tie and dye, basket weaving, soap making and beaded bag making. Each program is catered to those who are either academically inclined or vocationally inclined as they prepare for higher education and independent living.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are trying to raise $35,000 which will go to fund as many students both current and new trainnes students to help give them the best possible change at independent living. We intent to cover their entire tuition, living, feeding and all the assistive technology they need to aid their stay at the training Centre.</p>
<p>“According to the World Health Organization there are 180 million blind and partially sighted people in the world, of whom some 90 percent live in developing countries.  In low-income countries only about 2 percent of children receive education and of these no more than 5 percent will ever have gainful employment.  In rural areas unemployment rates approach 100 percent.  Even in industrialized countries unemployment rates from 50 to 75 percent are reported.” </p>
<p>With over 4 million persons that are considered blind in Nigeria, we have found that despite FNSB’s  best efforts to equip its students with certain skills that allows them to be competitive in the job market, there is an evident marginalization of people with visual impairment and the knowledge that “countries are losing a great deal of labor productivity by failing to provide for the vision health needs of their citizens and failing to help them integrate into the workforce”is cause for concern( Journalsplos.org). Making sure that our trainees our competitive in the job market or are skilled enough to be small business owners is the only way for them to lively independent</p>
<p>We have trained over 3000 students and many of our students currently run small businesses, some have gone on to higher institution. A few have been hired by the society, while others are teachers, gold medalists, authors and even work for the UN. We are very proud to say we have a robust track record of high achieving ex trainees who are making an impact in their various communities.</p>
<p>One of our biggest inspirations is the Perkins School for the Blind transitional program. At the Federal Nigeria Society for the Blind more than 95 percent of our student body are people who went blind mid life. So at one point they could see. We do not need to tell you the adjustment it takes to lose ones sight. Our program is a 2 year residency program aimed at rehabilitation, academic, professional and social inclusion.</p>
<p>The only risk is that we might still not get enough student enrollment, but given that already we have several students enrolled and many waiting to resume but deterred due to lack of financial aid, we do not think enrollment will be a problem.</p>
<p>All funds generated will be used to keep the Society running and ensure that each trainee has a fair go at an education and vocational training.</p>
<p>Other ways you can help will be sharing this cause of all your social media platforms, following us on social media on Instagram @fednigsoc4blind, Twitter @school4theblind and Facebook @ Federal Nigeria Society for the Blind. You can also share using the Indigogo tools to share.</p>

<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562593290/bbnum3xopxkrkwwxmax9.jpg"" src=""""/><strong>MARTIAL.GAMES, c'est quoi?</strong>
</h3>
<p>J'ai développé une méthode pour <strong>éduquer les enfants aux principes martiaux</strong> en les faisant évoluer sans qu'ils s'en rendent compte <strong>à travers un ensemble de jeux</strong>.</p>
<p>J'utilise les jeux comme <strong>dispositifs pédagogiques</strong> qui me permettent de les faire travailler autour de principes fins quand ils jouent. N'importe qui peu jouer, mais ceux qui travaillent un peu ou qui ont joué beaucoup, ont clairement un avantage...</p>
<p>Quand ils n'arrivent pas à faire quelque chose, ça les frustre un peu et c'est là que j'interviens pour les accompagner dans leur réflexion quand il s'agit de réfléchir, ou pour les diriger vers un type de travail quand il s'agit de travailler...</p>
<p>Étant donné qu'ils sont entre ""conscients qu'il y a un truc à travailler"" et carrément ""demandeurs de palier leur manques"", <strong>l'éducation se fait assez naturellement</strong>...</p>
<p>On travaille sur les principes martiaux et l'éveil au corps, certes, mais le plus intéressant dans mon travail, c'est <strong>quand les jeux martiaux ne sont plus qu'un prétexte </strong>à faire émerger le reste: Les considérations <strong>stratégiques et tactiques</strong>; la <strong>démocratie au travail </strong>et les jeux d'argumentation; les <strong>questions philosophiques</strong> qui émergent naturellement; et les <strong>enjeux éducatifs réels</strong> de dépassement de soi et de collaboration avec l'autre, etc...</p>
<p><strong><u>J'ai 45 jeux, divisé en 4 catégories</u>:</strong></p>
<p>Sports d'équipes (ex: variante de rugby avec sabres en mousse), Jeux de rôles (ex: ""Cluedo"" live où les duels sont autorisés), Jeux de stratégie/tactique (ex:capture de drapeau), et challenges de psychomotricité (ex: atelier équilibre et proprioception).</p>
<p>Chaque jeu fait appel à des compétence martiales d'une manière ou d'une autre, et tous les jeux sont prévus pour avoir plus d'un moyen d'arriver à ses fins...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Je travaille actuellement avec quelques écoles (mais c'est la fin de l'année ici aussi), j'ai trois classes hebdomadaires, et nous avons deux camps de vacances cet été...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pourquoi j'ai besoin de soutien?</h3>
<p>Alors, oui, je vis au paradis, et oui, on pourrait se dire que tout roule et que je peux tout faire tout seul... Possiblement oui, mais beaucoup plus lentement... Car si je veux rencontrer les standards que je vise (sécurité et fun), j'ai besoin d'investir de l'argent que je ne peux décemment pas inclure dans le prix de mes sessions ici, et que je n'ai plus moi-même...</p>
<p>Je comprends que pour la plupart d'entre vous qui me lisez ici, vous pouvez vous demander pourquoi donner de l'argent à l'étranger alors que par chez vous, c'est déjà assez chaud.</p>
<p>J'entends...</p>
<p>La vérité, tant pour ceux qui vivent en Europe que pour les francophones expatriés, c'est que j'ai besoin que ça fonctionne un peu plus longtemps ici pour que je puisse être <strong>certain que tout soit assez solide avant de le ré-exporter</strong>... Il s'agit de préparer un modèle qui puisse répondre à un tas de questions philosophiques, économiques, sociales et bien sûr, pédagogiques; Et quand je voudrai présenter ce modèle, je pense qu'il ne me sera permis aucun test, le modèle sera prêt ou ça ne le sera pas... Alors ce que je demande de financer ici, c'est ma possibilité de <strong>poursuivre mes tests</strong> sans avoir besoin d'y attacher une question de rentabilité (pour le moment) et surtout, de pouvoir commencer à <strong>produire la matière vidéo et écrite </strong>""au propre""...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Pourquoi ce ne sont pas les gens de Thaïlande qui payent?</strong></u></p>
<p>Ici, il n'y a pas de système social et tout est ""privé"". Soit on fait assez d'argent pour vivre et se payer des bonus, soit c'est très précaire! Les gamins Thaïs peuvent aller à l'école gratuitement (on en parlera plus tard), mais les gamins d'expats n'ont accès qu'aux écoles privées qui coûtent un demi rein par mois. Du coup les parents coupent sur les activités éducatives...</p>
<p>Alors, pour moi qui veut <strong>rendre accessible mon travail aux enfants à qui cela fait du bien</strong> et <strong>pas seulement à ceux qui peuvent se le permettre</strong>, je suis un peu dans un nœud...</p>
<p>Jusqu’ici je finance tout cela moi-même, fièrement <strong>sponsorisé par ma carte Visa</strong>! Je travaille aussi sur le côté pour ne pas être dépendant de cette rentrée d'argent, et je réinjecte 20%, non seulement de ce que les jeux martiaux me ""rapportent"" (il faut le dire vite), mais aussi 20% de ce que mes autres jobs me rapportent... Avec ça, je peux accuser les frais de participation des enfants dont les parents sont bien dans le rouge (c'est mon programme ""<strong>Martial Heart</strong>"" qui tourne déjà, et que, quelque part tu peux rejoindre en participant à cette campagne)...</p>
<p>On peut se dire que je suis un peu con-con d'essayer de financer ça alors que les parents devraient trouver une solution pour leurs propres gamins... J'avoue que souvent, je me le dis aussi... Mais bon! Je fais ce que je fais parce que ça a un sens, et j'ai bon espoir que ça soit <strong>rentable d'ici un an</strong>, comme ça je pourrai continuer à être con-con et utiliser les sous des gens qui peuvent payer correctement pour accueillir les gamins qui ont moins de sous... On ne se refait pas, hein?!</p>
<p>Je tiens à <strong>garder les prix à un niveau accessible</strong> pour les clients de l'île (5-8€ la session de 2h, là où un cours de yoga sera 10-18€ la session de 1H), mais niveau investissement, je ne peux simplement plus me permettre de mettre plus que ce que j'ai déjà mis (environ 5500€: principalement en changement de statuts légaux de ma compagnie, assurances, et matériel)...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Du coup <strong>j'ai besoin de vous</strong> (je ne te vouvoie pas soudainement, c'est un vous de ""toi et tes copains"")!</p>

<h3>Pourquoi m'aider?</h3>
<p>Que ce soit parce que tu vis en Thaïlande et que tu veux soutenir le programme ici et l'ouvrir aux enfants Thaïs, ou que ce soit parce que tu te rends compte qu'un modèle de pédagogie qui remet les enfant en mouvement dans une considération de groupe manque en Europe...</p>
<p>Que ce soit parce que tu m'aimes bien, parce qu'un jour j'ai fais une différence dans ta vie, ou parce que je t'ai moi-même soutenu quand tu en avais besoin; ou que ce soit simplement parce que tu trouves intéressant la notion de ""jeux martiaux"" aussi simplement que ça, j'ai envie de dire, peut importe... Et merci!</p>

<p><strong>POURQUOI SOUTENIR UN PROJET LOIN DE CHEZ TOI?</strong></p>
<p>Il s'agit au contraire de <strong>soutenir un projet qui va revenir chez toi</strong>, il est juste testé ici...</p>
<p>Je crois que les modèles pédagogiques comme celui que je développe ici sont <strong>le futur de l'éducation</strong>! Il s'agit de plus en plus de <strong>stimuler les enfants</strong> qu'on désire <strong>au ""centre"" de leur propre processus éducatif</strong> et de mettre en place des dispositifs qui rendent les <strong>enfants acteur/moteurs</strong> de leur développement... Ce désir est vrai sur mon île, mais aussi, je le sais, en occident!</p>
<p>Il ne s'agit donc pas seulement de soutenir un projet qui se passe loin de chez toi, il s'agit aussi de participer aux tests d'une approche pédagogique qui répond, selon moi, à la nouvelle réalité de l'éducation et au futur système qui devra en tenir compte... Je teste donc un modèle ici dans le but de le <strong>réimporter en occident </strong>quand tout sera prêt.</p>
<p>""L'enfant au centre de son processus"", c'est philosophiquement super propre! Je soutiens ce désir démocratique et progressiste de <strong>l'enfant responsabilisé</strong>, et j'entends bien y participer activement!</p>
<p>Œuvrer à cela veut dire aussi considérer une réalité qui est celle de <strong>""l'enfant-client""! </strong>Enfant-client qui va adhérer à ce qui lui est proposé/""vendu"" ou qui va le rejeter. Certains vieux profs regrettent le temps ou l'autorité institutionnelle leur permettait d'obliger les étudiants à travailler, mais ce temps est révolu, et j'en suis heureux. ""L'enfant-client"" ne va pas ""travailler"" s'il ne le veut pas! Dans le système actuel en occident, il est, certes, toujours possible de ""forcer"" les étudiants à rester jusqu'à 16h, mais c'est plus ou moins tout, et <strong>ils se désengagent s'ils ne sont pas stimulés et captivés</strong>...</p>
<p>Sur mon île, c'est plus direct, s'ils ""n'aiment pas"", ils cessent de venir. Et ne comptez pas sur les parents pour épauler de quelque manière que ce soit la démarche ou un sens de l'effort chez l'enfant, s'il ne veut pas, c'est mort!</p>
<p>Du coup cette île, c'est un peu l'enfer de l'enseignant: Quasi que des contraintes et zéro soutient! Mais c'est un enfer choisi, et quand ça passe et que ça marche, ça vaut tout le reste x10... Alors <strong>j'ai choisi</strong> de tester mon modèle ici!</p>
<p>Une fois que j'aurai fini mes tests ici, ce sera applicable et exportable partout! Et c'est ça que je vous demande de soutenir: <strong>Une participation à l'élaboration d'un modèle pédagogique adapté aux nouvelles réalités</strong>!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Le nouvel enjeu:</h3>
<p><strong>Stimuler/captiver les enfants </strong>est le nouveau jeu. Mais <strong>le nouvel enjeu est de faire de l'éducation</strong> dans ce <strong>nouveau paradigme ""d'enfant-client""</strong> si on veut ne pas sombrer dans le piège facile du clientélisme ou du récréatif occupationnel...</p>
<p>Et personnellement, je trouve ça captivant, et c'est comme cela que j'ai conçus le modèle que je défends et teste aujourd'hui... Et c'est pour cela que j'ai changé ma manière de travailler et que <strong>je propose du jeu de qualité</strong>, dans lequel<strong> je cache du principe éducatif</strong>...</p>
<p>Je n'ai pas tout compris encore, et c'est pourquoi je testerai encore pendant un an... Je devrai peut-être revoir ma copie, ou raffiner certaines choses... Mais ce que je fais ici, c'est d'<strong>éprouver méthodologiquement un modèle théorique</strong> pour le transformer en <strong>une approche pédagogique qui s'appuie sur une réalité de terrain. </strong></p>
<p>Je crois que beaucoup de nos échecs en occident sont dus au passage irréaliste de la théorie à l'application... Je crois qu'il est intègre de tester les modèles qu'on a l'intention d'implémenter...</p>
<p>Et je demande du soutien pour continuer à conduire des tests dans leur phase suivante...</p>

<p>Merci!</p>

<p>Avec 3000€ je continue à avancer, avec 6000€ je peux faire face à tout pendant un an... j'ai besoin d'environ 5000€ réels et je prévois 1000€ de marge de manœuvre...</p>
<p>Maintenant, je vais lancer cette campagne-ci pour 6000€, au cas où j'ai de bonnes surprises mais je pousse également les portes des commerces locaux, je vais aussi faire une campagne en anglais pour les gens que j'ai rencontré ici en trois ans, et j'ai déjà reçu des donations directes aussi...</p>

</div></div>","Je vais ici essayer de faire la présentation la plus directe possible. Ceux d'entre vous qui me connaissent bien savent que ça veut quand même dire trois pages et que cela m'obligera à en supprimer au moins 18 avant de poster ceci... Et si tu veux en savoir plus et que lire des kilomètres te plaît, fais-le-moi savoir ( play@martial.games ) et je t'envoie le dossier en français quand il est fini (je le traduis pour le moment).
Tu peux aussi suivre tout ça sur insta' ( @martial.games ) ... Ou, si lire en anglais n'est pas un problème, il y a la page Patreon ( https://www.patreon.com/MartialGames )

MARTIAL.GAMES, c'est quoi?

J'ai développé une méthode pour éduquer les enfants aux principes martiaux en les faisant évoluer sans qu'ils s'en rendent compte à travers un ensemble de jeux.
J'utilise les jeux comme dispositifs pédagogiques qui me permettent de les faire travailler autour de principes fins quand ils jouent. N'importe qui peu jouer, mais ceux qui travaillent un peu ou qui ont joué beaucoup, ont clairement un avantage...
Quand ils n'arrivent pas à faire quelque chose, ça les frustre un peu et c'est là que j'interviens pour les accompagner dans leur réflexion quand il s'agit de réfléchir, ou pour les diriger vers un type de travail quand il s'agit de travailler...
Étant donné qu'ils sont entre ""conscients qu'il y a un truc à travailler"" et carrément ""demandeurs de palier leur manques"", l'éducation se fait assez naturellement...
On travaille sur les principes martiaux et l'éveil au corps, certes, mais le plus intéressant dans mon travail, c'est quand les jeux martiaux ne sont plus qu'un prétexte à faire émerger le reste: Les considérations stratégiques et tactiques; la démocratie au travail et les jeux d'argumentation; les questions philosophiques qui émergent naturellement; et les enjeux éducatifs réels de dépassement de soi et de collaboration avec l'autre, etc...
J'ai 45 jeux, divisé en 4 catégories:
Sports d'équipes (ex: variante de rugby avec sabres en mousse), Jeux de rôles (ex: ""Cluedo"" live où les duels sont autorisés), Jeux de stratégie/tactique (ex:capture de drapeau), et challenges de psychomotricité (ex: atelier équilibre et proprioception).
Chaque jeu fait appel à des compétence martiales d'une manière ou d'une autre, et tous les jeux sont prévus pour avoir plus d'un moyen d'arriver à ses fins...
 
Je travaille actuellement avec quelques écoles (mais c'est la fin de l'année ici aussi), j'ai trois classes hebdomadaires, et nous avons deux camps de vacances cet été...
 
Pourquoi j'ai besoin de soutien?
Alors, oui, je vis au paradis, et oui, on pourrait se dire que tout roule et que je peux tout faire tout seul... Possiblement oui, mais beaucoup plus lentement... Car si je veux rencontrer les standards que je vise (sécurité et fun), j'ai besoin d'investir de l'argent que je ne peux décemment pas inclure dans le prix de mes sessions ici, et que je n'ai plus moi-même...
Je comprends que pour la plupart d'entre vous qui me lisez ici, vous pouvez vous demander pourquoi donner de l'argent à l'étranger alors que par chez vous, c'est déjà assez chaud.
J'entends...
La vérité, tant pour ceux qui vivent en Europe que pour les francophones expatriés, c'est que j'ai besoin que ça fonctionne un peu plus longtemps ici pour que je puisse être certain que tout soit assez solide avant de le ré-exporter... Il s'agit de préparer un modèle qui puisse répondre à un tas de questions philosophiques, économiques, sociales et bien sûr, pédagogiques; Et quand je voudrai présenter ce modèle, je pense qu'il ne me sera permis aucun test, le modèle sera prêt ou ça ne le sera pas... Alors ce que je demande de financer ici, c'est ma possibilité de poursuivre mes tests sans avoir besoin d'y attacher une question de rentabilité (pour le moment) et surtout, de pouvoir commencer à produire la matière vidéo et écrite ""au propre""...
 
Pourquoi ce ne sont pas les gens de Thaïlande qui payent?
Ici, il n'y a pas de système social et tout est ""privé"". Soit on fait assez d'argent pour vivre et se payer des bonus, soit c'est très précaire! Les gamins Thaïs peuvent aller à l'école gratuitement (on en parlera plus tard), mais les gamins d'expats n'ont accès qu'aux écoles privées qui coûtent un demi rein par mois. Du coup les parents coupent sur les activités éducatives...
Alors, pour moi qui veut rendre accessible mon travail aux enfants à qui cela fait du bien et pas seulement à ceux qui peuvent se le permettre, je suis un peu dans un nœud...
Jusqu’ici je finance tout cela moi-même, fièrement sponsorisé par ma carte Visa! Je travaille aussi sur le côté pour ne pas être dépendant de cette rentrée d'argent, et je réinjecte 20%, non seulement de ce que les jeux martiaux me ""rapportent"" (il faut le dire vite), mais aussi 20% de ce que mes autres jobs me rapportent... Avec ça, je peux accuser les frais de participation des enfants dont les parents sont bien dans le rouge (c'est mon programme ""Martial Heart"" qui tourne déjà, et que, quelque part tu peux rejoindre en participant à cette campagne)...
On peut se dire que je suis un peu con-con d'essayer de financer ça alors que les parents devraient trouver une solution pour leurs propres gamins... J'avoue que souvent, je me le dis aussi... Mais bon! Je fais ce que je fais parce que ça a un sens, et j'ai bon espoir que ça soit rentable d'ici un an, comme ça je pourrai continuer à être con-con et utiliser les sous des gens qui peuvent payer correctement pour accueillir les gamins qui ont moins de sous... On ne se refait pas, hein?!
Je tiens à garder les prix à un niveau accessible pour les clients de l'île (5-8€ la session de 2h, là où un cours de yoga sera 10-18€ la session de 1H), mais niveau investissement, je ne peux simplement plus me permettre de mettre plus que ce que j'ai déjà mis (environ 5500€: principalement en changement de statuts légaux de ma compagnie, assurances, et matériel)...
 
Du coup j'ai besoin de vous (je ne te vouvoie pas soudainement, c'est un vous de ""toi et tes copains"")!
 
Pourquoi m'aider?
Que ce soit parce que tu vis en Thaïlande et que tu veux soutenir le programme ici et l'ouvrir aux enfants Thaïs, ou que ce soit parce que tu te rends compte qu'un modèle de pédagogie qui remet les enfant en mouvement dans une considération de groupe manque en Europe...
Que ce soit parce que tu m'aimes bien, parce qu'un jour j'ai fais une différence dans ta vie, ou parce que je t'ai moi-même soutenu quand tu en avais besoin; ou que ce soit simplement parce que tu trouves intéressant la notion de ""jeux martiaux"" aussi simplement que ça, j'ai envie de dire, peut importe... Et merci!
 
POURQUOI SOUTENIR UN PROJET LOIN DE CHEZ TOI?
Il s'agit au contraire de soutenir un projet qui va revenir chez toi, il est juste testé ici...
Je crois que les modèles pédagogiques comme celui que je développe ici sont le futur de l'éducation! Il s'agit de plus en plus de stimuler les enfants qu'on désire au ""centre"" de leur propre processus éducatif et de mettre en place des dispositifs qui rendent les enfants acteur/moteurs de leur développement...

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>""Xamxam"" in Senegalese Wolof means ""Knowledge"".</p>
<p><strong>Project Preview</strong>: <a href=""http://www.xamxam.tech/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.xamxam.tech/</a></p>
<p>My name is Fodé Diop. I'm originally from a small country in West Africa called Sénégal. I migrated to the United States in 1994 to study Computer Science and to play basketball. I love Computer Science and all the related fields: Information Security, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Financial Cryptography etc..</p>
<p>In the words of Stephen Wolfram, Computational Thinking will be a defining feature of the future and children need to learn it now to ensure success later on. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture — success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well.</p>
<p>The question is, how is the youth in the non-english speaking parts of Africa acquire all this knowledge when most of the time it's not being taught in their native languages?</p>
<p>Throughout my whole life, knowledge acquisition has always been a challenge because I've always been instructed in a foreign language.</p>
<p>Not too much effort has been put into education the youth in their native languages, as the latter have always been deemed unfit for education which is far from the truth.</p>
<p>In the early 60s, Dr. Cheikh Anta Diop translated parts of Albert Einstein's ""Theory Of Relativity"" in his native Wolof just to prove that it was doable.</p>
<p>To write great Computer Software today you have to speak and write decent English. So how do we bridge that gap for non-native English speakers?</p>
<p>I believe that the Python programming language is the best introductory one. It's a fairly simple language which reads and write like plain English.</p>
<p>It will teach the Sénégalese students fundamental concept of computer science, while in the same token accelerating their understanding and familiarity with the English language.</p>
<p>Learning Computational Thinking is already a difficult endeavor, mastering it in a language other than your native one is the ultimate challenge.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised will allow us to build a comprehensive online platform tailored specifically for that part of the world, with the native speakers in mind.</p>
<p>Besides immortalizing your name in the software source code, we have amazing original perks from Sénégal for our contributors. We plan on open sourcing this project and your name will be forever engraved in a piece of code that has the potential of impacting the growth of Africa for decades to come.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal of $20,000 any funds raised will help build the initial platform, no matter how limited. They will also be used to buy used equipment to improve the quality of the online lessons.</p>

""Xamxam"" in Senegalese Wolof means ""Knowledge"".
Project Preview: http://www.xamxam.tech/
My name is Fodé Diop. I'm originally from a small country in West Africa called Sénégal. I migrated to the United States in 1994 to study Computer Science and to play basketball. I love Computer Science and all the related fields: Information Security, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Financial Cryptography etc..
In the words of Stephen Wolfram, Computational Thinking will be a defining feature of the future and children need to learn it now to ensure success later on. Doctors, lawyers, teachers, farmers, whatever. The future of all these professions will be full of computational thinking. Whether it’s sensor-based medicine, computational contracts, education analytics or computational agriculture — success is going to rely on being able to do computational thinking well.
The question is, how is the youth in the non-english speaking parts of Africa acquire all this knowledge when most of the time it's not being taught in their native languages?
Throughout my whole life, knowledge acquisition has always been a challenge because I've always been instructed in a foreign language.
Not too much effort has been put into education the youth in their native languages, as the latter have always been deemed unfit for education which is far from the truth.
In the early 60s, Dr. Cheikh Anta Diop translated parts of Albert Einstein's ""Theory Of Relativity"" in his native Wolof just to prove that it was doable.
To write great Computer Software today you have to speak and write decent English. So how do we bridge that gap for non-native English speakers?
I believe that the Python programming language is the best introductory one. It's a fairly simple language which reads and write like plain English.
It will teach the Sénégalese students fundamental concept of computer science, while in the same token accelerating their understanding and familiarity with the English language.
Learning Computational Thinking is already a difficult endeavor, mastering it in a language other than your native one is the ultimate challenge.

What We Need & What You Get
The funds raised will allow us to build a comprehensive online platform tailored specifically for that part of the world, with the native speakers in mind.
Besides immortalizing your name in the software source code, we have amazing original perks from Sénégal for our contributors. We plan on open sourcing this project and your name will be forever engraved in a piece of code that has the potential of impacting the growth of Africa for decades to come.
Even if we don't reach our goal of $20,000 any funds raised will help build the initial platform, no matter how limited. They will also be used to buy used equipment to improve the quality of the online lessons.

The Impact
By contributing to this campaign you are helping fix a major flaw in the West African educational system. You will help bring modern education to the student directly as the platform will be available for free online 24 hours a day. 
This platform will not only train students, but it will train local Instructors as well. A wide range of citizens can benefit from it.
The rate at which awesome Data Scientist are trained needs to be accelerated. To fix Africa's problems we will need them to make sense out of the available data and get some insights as to how the problems in Agriculture, Health, Mobile Banking and even Education can be solved.

Risks & Challenges
There aren't any known risk to the project. The main challenge is finding competent instructors who are multi-lingual.

seminars, workshops and retreats in the public domain I wanted to contribute
our support to Veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan to help them
restore their core and help them rebuild their resilience and relationships.
 In my quest to make our programs available to these
returning Veterans and current military and their families, I had the idea to
build the Careapy® Learning Channel website, put all of our recorded programs
up on it so this underserved population could have the support they need when
they need it. They are a proud group who don't want charity or something for
nothing so we selected an affordable subscription price of $19.95 a month for
those who can pay. 
Our Veterans and their families do not want a handout but they do need a handup and now together with your financial contributions, support and
our Careapy® programs those who need it the most can take advantage of these many
programs in the privacy of their home or overseas bases free from stigma.
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge of any new website is marketing. 
We have received three proposals from marketing professionals who are anxious
to help us launch these important and timely educational seminars to those it
would be most useful to. 
The cost in terms of time for converting audio/video into
mp3/mp4 is substantial necessitating launching the Careapy® Learning Channel
website with the existing four full seminar courses (approx. 12 hours each) as
well as five evening courses (approx. 2 hours each).  The remaining 35
programs both audio and video will be released on the website as they are
converted.  It is estimated that approximately five new programs per month
will be added.
Other Ways You Can Help
I humbly request that you join us on this exciting adventure
by financially contributing to the funding of our Indiegogo Crowd Funding
Campaign for the Careapy® Learning Channel and by sharing our Crowd Funding
Campaign with all of your friends, family and contacts via all media available.
You can also use the Indiegogo support tools to help us accomplish our goal as
well.
You can also go to www.dynamicrelationshipstraining.com and download this $99 twelve hour audio recorded seminar and these proceeds will be used to fund the Careapy® Learning Channel.  
Thank you for considering these requests as we continue to strive to make this world a better place or our generation and the next.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>In 2010, Rob and Kristi began their journey to Nepal to work with children in two orphanages, most of whom were former <i>Kamlari </i>(indentured servants). What they experienced in <b>this work changed their lives</b>. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157355/files/20150118125422-UsPokhara.jpg?1421614462"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Until then, it had been so easy to live as though what was happening ""over there"" was just an evening news clip, but after living with the children day after day, learning each of their unique backgrounds, and seeing the brilliance of their beautiful personalities, these were no longer distant stories. <br/><p>This was personal. <b>This was real.</b></p>
<p>Today, Rob and Kristi's goal to see an end to child slavery is enormous, no doubt. But they have a steadfast belief in the <b>power of humanity and community</b>--faith and conviction that what we can do together is greater than the sum of our individual efforts. <br/></p>
<p>Being educated in counseling and human development, they launched a teacher and social worker training program in 2014 in cooperation with a Kathmandu orphanage and nearby school. Rob worked stateside and Kristi left for Nepal to organize and lead the first of what they hoped would be many workshops to come. This effort was a true <b>leap of faith</b> into the unknown. The first challenge would be to show the value of such training to a skeptical (at best) group of school officials, social workers and community members.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1156826/files/20150118074314-TeacherTraining.jpg?1421595794"" src="""" style=""width: 573.382px; height: 438px;""/></p>By the end of October 2014, the first workshop was complete--and<b> it was an absolute success! </b><br/><br/><p>Hardened hearts were changed. Perspectives were shifted. And, in a tremendous display of support for the continuation of this training program, the principal of the local school extended an invitation to use her school, her staff of 30, and her 700 students as the first training partnership in Kathmandu!</p>
<p>Culturally, socially and emotionally, this level of commitment is nothing short of a <b>very big deal</b>!</p>
<p>Our training is focused on helping the children build shame resiliency skills, a sense of worthiness, and courage. <b>Building a practitioner and community support network for children to flourish</b> in the future is our
 primary goal. A stretch goal for 2015 is to hold additional workshops 
for some of the young women who were former <i>Kamlari</i>, and who are now beginning to build their futures as independent adults. As they set out on their own and pursue their educational or 
career endeavors, they are the most vulnerable to falling back into the 
cycle of poverty, and we want to help ensure they receive additional 
support on their new path. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have an immediate goal, a stretch goal, and long-term goals for our project. Here's the breakdown and nitty gritty of each:</p>
<ul><li>
<b>Immediate Goal:</b> Our first objective is to return to Kathmandu to hold another workshop for the 30 teachers waiting for us. To do this, we need to raise $5,000 to cover expenses. This accounts for all expenses to hold three 10-person workshops including facility rental, materials and supplies. Every dollar donated directly supports this workshop, and the time loss away from our ""normal work"" to facilitate these events is our personal donation (i.e. we do not earn any income from holding these training workshops). There will be no fee to the school nor the teachers to participate, and we want to eliminate all other indirect costs, as well. In our 2014 workshop, funded by our own financial contribution, participants received all workshop materials and supplies (even pens and paper are expensive luxuries in Nepal!); meals and snacks were provided for three full days; clean bottled water was plentiful; and safe transportation to and from the meeting location was assured for each participant (most of whom were women). The average annual income in Nepal is less than $300 per year and does not adequately support a family's needs, so we also provided each participant with a stipend to help offset their lost wages for their three days in the workshop. All of the above will be provided again in 2015's workshops.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Stretch Goal:</b> Raising an additional $1,500 allows us to broaden our reach and hold a fourth workshop specifically for young women who are ex-<i>Kamlari</i>.  Using the research and methodology of <a href=""http://brenebrown.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Brené Brown</a>, in which Rob and Kristi are both certified, this workshop will support the girls in cultivating a courage practice and the shame resiliency skills that support their journey towards future life goals.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Longterm Project Goals:</b> Once we have raised a total of $15,000, we will be able to accomplish all of the above, plus launch a self-sustaining fundraising model to continue annual workshops going forward, as well as beginning our new project--The Amai Program. <i>Amai </i>is the Nepali word for grandmother, and our project will partner local women with orphanages to create a community-supported cooperative effort that provides nurturance to orphaned children while creating meaningful work and fair wages for local women. More information about our project goals, including The Amai Program, can be found on <a href=""http://www.richertcoaching.com/p/support.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our website</a>.</li></ul>
<b>PERKS!</b><br/>When you make the decision to contribute towards this project, the 
size of your generosity directly correlates with the number of people we
 are able to help. Here are the perks available to supporters of this project:<br/><br/><ul><li>
<b>Perks from Nepal!</b> We shopped at local vendors in Nepal who sell their handicrafts, and support fair labor for their crafters, to find some great gifts! Each item is unique and handmade; colors and details will vary.<br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Books and DVDs!</b> In addition to these amazing Nepal handicrafts, you can learn more about the methodology we use in our workshops as well as the issues facing girls living in developing countries. Two of our favorites pieces of work are perks that will bring depth and knowledge of the work we are doing to donors who wish the engage more profoundly.</li></ul>

<br/><p>This Indiegogo campaign is set up to disperse all funds raised, even if we do not meet our full fundraising goal, because every dollar raised helps to make a difference in the continuation our work. In addition, perks are not dependent on meeting the total fundraising objective nor the campaign timelines, but will instead be sent at the time of your contribution, based upon the perk/donation level in which you choose to participate. <br/></p>
<p>The Indiegogo processing fees for this type of campaign are a bit higher than campaigns that must be fully funded within a timeline, so we understand that some individuals might choose to opt out of perks in order to have more of their contribution be used for program goals. If this is your preference, please just send us an email to let us know.</p>
<p>We will continue to fundraise through various channels until we meet our campaign goal. Even after this Indiegogo campaign ends, the opportunity to support this project in the future through one-time support or monthly ongoing support is explained on <a href=""http://www.richertcoaching.com/p/support.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a>.</p>

<h3>The Impact, Challenges &amp; Risks<br/>
</h3> <p>Our first workshop in 2014 was truly a labor of love and faith. Nearly a year of pre-planning and curriculum development time was invested before we even arrived in Kathmandu. And, we went into the project with an awareness that we would encounter bumps.</p>
<p>Having never used our curriculum beyond a Western audience, we knew there would be work to bridge cultural, social and language barriers. And, there was. We knew that navigating the logistics of holding a workshop in Nepal would be challenging. And, it was. <br/></p>
<p>Because of our existing experience in Nepal, we were ready for teaching without reliable access to electricity, always without heat, with the daily chore of navigating congested dirt roads to our meeting location, with shooing away various farm animals along the way, and, most heartwarming, with making time in our busy teaching schedule to play with local kids and gain the trust of the community.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1157162/files/20150118111607-Collage3.png?1421608567"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Now viewed as an extremely successful ""pilot"" project, our work in 2014 has enabled us to refine our curriculum and address particular regional topics in more depth. Additionally, we've built lasting relationships with supporters in Kathmandu who are ready to help us bring this work to more of the people who need it most. And while we are already very prepared for the challenges of this project, having strengthened our network in 2014 provides us with an additional level of support that only comes with community ""buy in"".<br/><br/><p>Training teachers and social workers in our curriculum helps them to provide better support to the children with whom they work and to support the children's long-term development. Obstacles we may face as we expand this work are primarily in cultivating or deepening relationships with those in Kathmandu who can assist with these objectives.</p>
<p>In the months following the workshops, we believe it will be important to facilitate ongoing check-ins with the teachers who receive training in order to ensure that the ideas stick. We have developed a plan to accomplish this by using web-based teleconferencing. The obvious challenge is making the technology available to all who need it and maintaining participation when we are no longer physically in Nepal. We have verbal support of two Kathmandu organizations to help with this goal, and we will need to continue cultivating those relationships to ensure success.<br/></p>
<p>Continuing our fundraising efforts will also be vitally important to ensure the project's continuation and growth. To address this, we have created the option for supporters to make one-time, as well as monthly, contributions on <a href=""http://www.richertcoaching.com/p/support.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a>. We have also developed a marketing plan that we intend to be self-sustaining, and we plan to launch that campaign once our current fundraising objectives are met and allow us to invest in the materials needed for that endeavor.<br/></p>

If you would like to help us further our project goals, here are some ways you can help:</p> <ul> <li>

We have already secured excavation services and two possible dig sites,which has reduced the cost of doing a dig by 90 percent. This fundraiser will cover the miscellaneous expenses that will be necessary to conduct a full investigation including,full lab analysis of the material to be shown to the public,and any other services which may be needed to properly document ALL available information pertaining to the makeup of the wall's stone bricks and it's geo-polymer mortar.  It will also cover the production costs of the filming of the entire process which will be released as a full length documentary that we will be be entering into film festivals highlighting tales from Texas. Other expenses will include day to day operating costs of the investigation,including power generator rentals,water pumps,hand tools for digging etc.  We will also be the first excavation to go below 25 feet,almost 100 feet down to the bedrock in order to properly show what no one has ever seen,that the blocks get bigger the farther down you go! This will not be a made for tv whitewash,this investigation will show for the first time everything people have heard about the rockwall,(crystalline makeup,piezo electric ability etc) in order to allow this relic of the ancient past to have a proper day in court. This is your chance to make history and keep history from being written by the bad guys. We have already covered most of the cost but unforeseen events and circumstances have increased slightly due to the difficulty to obtain the dig sites.

</p><p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>My name is
Antonia Alvarez and I am from Quito, Ecuador. I have been involved with the
Galo Plaza Foundation for many years because it was founded by my great
grandfather Galo Plaza, the past president of Ecuador. Galo Plaza was a true
philanthropist. Gradually I have been falling in love with the community, the
foundation and the people. The feeling I get every time I go to Zuleta is
surreal because many children whom I have worked with call me by my name and
greet me with enthusiasm. </p>
<p>When I got an honor scholarship I felt as if I had won the lottery. Then is
when I decided to donate the amount of my scholarship to a less privileged
child of rural Ecuador. Suddenly I had a dream; it was to find a way to make it
possible for most of the children in Zuleta to go to school. I was surprised to
find out that with the amount of my scholarship I could pay for school for 33
children.</p>
<p>In order to get started with this project, I talked to some of my
friends that also had been awarded with scholarships. Then is when Paulo Torres
decided to join this campaign. We both donated, but we thought we could find
more people to donate. Today, we are working together to fundraise $4,500
dollars to pay for school for 15 children in Zuleta.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>We only need to get people to donate. One full scholarship for one child
for one year is worth $300.</p>
<p>Our goal is to reach $4,500. All the funds will go directly to the Galo
Plaza Lasso Foundation to be used to pay for a child's education. The Galo
Plaza Lasso Foundation has been running the same program; therefore, the
procedure will be the same for our project. The foundation chooses the children
who are the most needed based on information provided by the principal of the
community's school. The foundation has strong ties with the school and it
will assure that the most vulnerable children get access to education. </p>
<p><b>What You Get </b></p>
<p>The person that makes the most generous donation will receive a
free night for two people at the Hacienda Zuleta Hotel (<a href=""http://zuleta.com)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://zuleta.com</a>). </p>
<p>The second most generous donor will receive a collection of custom made
perfumes of my brand, ""Quinta Esencia.""  </p>
<p>Everyone who donates is welcome to visit Hacienda Zuleta and the
foundation to meet the community. If you come to Zuleta you get first choice to
volunteer at the Galo Plaza Foundation. </p>
<p>We will also make sure that you get an update of how the child you
supported is doing in school.    </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>With Paulo's donation and mine we will finance one school year for 66
children. Additionally, if we reach our goal 15 more children will
be benefited. A total of 81 children would get a
full scholarship for the coming school year of 2015-2016. If there
are less than 81 children that need financial aid, the money will be saved in
the foundation's fund to finance the following school year of the most
needed. </p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges </b></p>
<p>We are prepared to face any challenges that come in the way. The Galo
Plaza Lasso Foundation's director has vast experience with social work in the
community and she will help us through the process of selecting the
children and assuring that the funds are well administrated. </p>
<p>The biggest risk involved in donating a scholarship is that the children
that receive scholarships live under very critical conditions. Therefore, they
are the most vulnerable to drop out of school and the money would be lost if we
cannot find another child to take his or her place.      </p>
<p>I know a child, Ismael, who has received a scholarship for 5 consecutive years
and he has made the most out of it. He participates in many extracurricular activities,
takes advantage of tutoring and has good grades. Despite all the barriers that
prevent him from going to school such as the fact that he has to take care of
his siblings, cook for the family and look after the animals, he
is successful.  </p>

<p>We are partnering with Indiegogo in our <b>world-wide campaign</b> to <b>introduce
meditation to young children</b> to calm aggression and anger while at the same time reinforcing positive
emotions and behavior. <br/></p>
<p>We want to make
meditation for children fun and inspiring.</p>
<p> Your contributions will help us to develop our <b>Karma Kyle the Crocodile</b> books, animation videos and other products for kids ages 3 and up.</p>

<h3>Our Inspirational Story</h3>
<br/>It all started a few
years ago when a very close person sent me a quote by the Dalai Lama:<br/><br/><h4><b><i>“If every child in the world would be taught
meditation, we would eliminate violence in the world within one generation”</i></b></h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I thought to myself,
could this really be possible? </p>
<p>My first reaction was
that the world has battled with war and violence since the dawn of time and there
is no way that is going to change.</p>
<p>But where do all
these problems and acts of violence stem from?<span>  <b>The mind.</b></span></p>
<p>The mind, as we all
know, is a very powerful thing.</p>
<p>….an <b>untrained mind</b>
can be dangerous and damaging to others.<span> 
It overreacts, it is overrun with emotions, it often says things without
thinking about consequences and initiates acts that we often find
incomprehensible.</span></p>
<p>.....but a <b>trained mind</b> through
meditation can positively change the way we think, what we say and how we act.</p>
<p>I have worked as a naturopathic doctor for more than 20 years, dealing with natural means to heal the mind, body and spirit and having practiced meditation for years, it has become clear to me
that if we want to make peace in the world and achieve the health and happiness that we all deserve, we have to start with ourselves, especially
our <b>children</b> and <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>of most importance our <b>minds. <br/></b></p>
<p></p>

<h3>Who is Karma Kyle the Crocodile?

something positive, we need a reason and often we need a role model, someone we
can relate to and look up to and follow.

<p>Even children.<br/></p>
<p>So, although maybe
seen as an unlikely guru or role model for young children,  the <b><i>Karma Kyle the Crocodile</i></b>  cartoon character was born. The
first meditating crocodile in the world.</p>
<p>….but come to think
of it, what better animal character than the often perceived fierce, cruel, ruthless crocodile
could be a more worthy contender for needing meditation practice?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431372354/qepabvh46nc1t9ez47gb.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 344.082px; height: 281px;""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Karma Kyle</b> is a little
boy crocodile, who like any other typical child, is always pushing the limits
and getting into trouble. Thank goodness he has his meditating family to keep
him in line. Throughout his adventures, Karma Kyle deals with greed, jealousy,
anger and a host of other negative emotions and often through the hard way,
learns that bad deeds always lead to a bad ending (hence karma), and that meditation
and positive emotions will always help to get you back on the right track.</p>

meditation to young children to calm aggression and anger while at the same time reinforcing positive
emotions and behavior. 
We want to make
meditation for children fun and inspiring.
 Your contributions will help us to develop our Karma Kyle the Crocodile books, animation videos and other products for kids ages 3 and up.



Our Inspirational Story
It all started a few
years ago when a very close person sent me a quote by the Dalai Lama:“If every child in the world would be taught
meditation, we would eliminate violence in the world within one generation”

I thought to myself,
could this really be possible? 
My first reaction was
that the world has battled with war and violence since the dawn of time and there
is no way that is going to change.
But where do all
these problems and acts of violence stem from?  The mind.
The mind, as we all
know, is a very powerful thing.
….an untrained mind
can be dangerous and damaging to others. 
It overreacts, it is overrun with emotions, it often says things without
thinking about consequences and initiates acts that we often find
incomprehensible.
.....but a trained mind through
meditation can positively change the way we think, what we say and how we act.
I have worked as a naturopathic doctor for more than 20 years, dealing with natural means to heal the mind, body and spirit and having practiced meditation for years, it has become clear to me
that if we want to make peace in the world and achieve the health and happiness that we all deserve, we have to start with ourselves, especially
our children and of most importance our minds. 

                

Who is Karma Kyle the Crocodile?


To motivate us to do
something positive, we need a reason and often we need a role model, someone we
can relate to and look up to and follow.

Even children.
So, although maybe
seen as an unlikely guru or role model for young children,  the Karma Kyle the Crocodile  cartoon character was born. The
first meditating crocodile in the world.
….but come to think
of it, what better animal character than the often perceived fierce, cruel, ruthless crocodile
could be a more worthy contender for needing meditation practice?


Karma Kyle is a little
boy crocodile, who like any other typical child, is always pushing the limits
and getting into trouble. Thank goodness he has his meditating family to keep
him in line. Throughout his adventures, Karma Kyle deals with greed, jealousy,
anger and a host of other negative emotions and often through the hard way,
learns that bad deeds always lead to a bad ending (hence karma), and that meditation
and positive emotions will always help to get you back on the right track.

Meet the Karma Crocodile Family:

Meet some of the Bad Guys:
       



Meet a very unusually talented elephant:                  





and a very Wise Owl:

                                      
Why your involvement is so important

We want you to play an
important part in the beginning of a world-wide campaign to educate and introduce
meditation to young children to calm manage negative emotions such as aggression, fear and anger while at the same time reinforcing positive
emotions and behavior.We want to make
meditation for children fun and inspiring through our Karma Kyle the Crocodile books, animation videos and other products.

</p><p>Hello, I'm Mandy, I run the  <b>The Good Samaritan Foundation
of Haiti </b>- a small donor-funded charity working in 2 parts of rural Haiti. Our
main work over the last 5 years has been in building and operating two <b>FREE</b>
primary schools that educate and feed 500 children ages 3 to 18. </p>
<p>However, we recognize the urgent need
for more advanced skills and higher education for our communities - so we
started a scholarship program for high-school, trade school and university.
 As we go into the third year we already have two graduates, Jude serving
as our 5th grade teacher, and our agriculture manager Anousse, who both live on
Ile a Vache  working for our foundation and the community - enabling
others to learn from their knowledge and bringing new ideas and trade-able
skills.</p>

<p>We have to raise essential funds to

<p>The Dream Scholarship (DS) helps 5 undergraduate English students at the University of Panama (UP) reach their dream of getting a well-rounded English education and contributing to US-Panamanian cross-cultural understanding. It was created through a partnership between the United States embassy of Panama, the Fulbright Alumni Association in Panama, the University of Panama, and Murray State University (MSU) in Kentucky, USA. Named after Dr. Martin Luther King’s momentous speech, the program also encourages the students to use the knowledge they gain to serve their communities in Panama.</p>
<p> <b>II.</b><b>Why We're Doing It</b></p>
<p>Many students at the UP want
to have a deeper understanding of English in a U.S. cultural context. This
includes everyday idioms, formal and informal speech, and native-speaker
pronunciation. This desire comes at a time when Panama’s economy is developing
quickly, and there is a large demand for fluent English speakers in the job
market. The DS gives students the education they need to use
English in a cultural context, as well as prepare them to compete in their own
country’s emerging economy.</p>
<p><b>  III.How We're Doing It</b></p>
<p>5 students from the UP will
participate in a two-month cultural immersion program at MSU. Students will be chosen based on their
academic achievements, English level, and commitment to community service.
During January and February of 2016, these students will:</p>
<p>· Take a 20 hour/week intensive
English language immersion course</p>
<p>· Take a class on U.S. culture</p>
<p>· Field trips to nearby cities in
the U.S. (ie. Louisville,KY; St. Louis, MO; Nashville, TN; Chicago, IL)</p>
<p>When they return to Panama, they will work with
the U.S. embassy on several community service projects related to English
teaching.</p>
<p> <b>IV.</b><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>The total
cost per participant is estimated at $5,000. Donate $10, $25, $50,or $100

<b><h3>Summary</h3> </b><p>Windows of Hip Hop is a Bronx based economic development project dedicated to utilizing Hip Hop to teach. We are a educational chartered, Bronx, NY based non-profit registered with the State of New York. We have developed several curriculums and implemented several initiatives from Health and Fitness to Anti-Bullying campaigns; which we will share with over 15,000 students in the New York Tri-State Major Metropolitan Area! We are a strong group of business people, advocates, educators, entertainers, entrepreneurs, administrators, mothers and fathers who LOVE Hip Hop and recognize the true transformative power of this culture. </p>
<p>Our campaign will build on our work with other non-profits and government agencies to improve students cognitive skills, task management, and appreciation for community. We seek to counter the malaise, disinterest, and modern angst by invigorating, inspiring, and being a catalyst for educators. 15,000 youth will be engaged, challenged then shown how valuable education is as well as their educators. 15,000 young students will be interested and intrigued by an art form they know and are familiar with. This leads to better behavior in class, in the home, and in the community. </p>
<p>You can give 15,000 chances for a different outcome in a young person's life. Hip Hop has transformed the world but rap is just one of It's foundations. Your support will help reestablish the proper balance in our people, our families, and our culture.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3> <p>We have calculated a reasonable budget of $75,000 to complete our campaign. This will cover transportation, educational supplies, Audio &amp; Visual aids, staff, rentals, fees, and the all important talent. We have some excellent celebrities, personalities, and entertainers committed to the project willing to show at cost! Let's all take advantage of those opportunities and build. As you can calculate, our programs are timely, realistic, and cost-effective. </p>
<p>In return for your generosity, not only will we make mention of such . .  . all contributors will be given a link to a powerful, live performance by our team during the campaign! All the perks we chose are with you in mind. Things we'd want and would use. Memorabilia, music, Shirts and merchandise in addition to appearances, trips and television shows!!!</p>
<p>And if we fall short of our goal? No problem, we will reassess and adjust. Hip Hop teaches perseverance, ingenuity, and determination. We will see this done. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Our campaign is different because not only educators developed it. Grand Master Melle Mel was one of a few luminaries of Hip Hop who contributed to this project. We planned, studied, performed trial engagements, and created forums to process feedback. The result? A suite of proven programs which work. Students, educators, parents, and administrators are all engaged, focused, and become invested in the favorable outcomes we design. The contribution you make impacts over 10 fold. It allows a great team of stakeholders to put into effect a challenging, persuasive argument to counter some of the most jaded of individuals like today's students. </p>
<p>Our team has worked in the past on similar programs with non-profits, after school programs, and agencies. The approach is similar but the delivery is pin point perfect. Hip Hop IS a powerful medium and we are experts at sharing effectively. Our video highlights one of the groups in the Bronx who engaged with our program and proves the worth of our team. This was just a small scale sample of the greater impact your contribution will have. With our music, shirts, or banners you reemphasize our work and help counter the narrative which tries to ignore Hip Hop's positive influence. If you LOVE Hip Hop you can provide the opportunity for over 15,000 youths to appreciate what you know is true! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>WE are embarking on an aggressive campaign to change the minds of 15,000 young people. We understand the very real challenge it is to connect with the youth in a meaningful way. Communication gaps, ADD, and modern distractions have disconnected the youth like never before. Some may believe nothing can crack that armor. That today, children are scary they don't listen but rather intimidate those trying to help. These are the same obstacles Hip Hop has beaten before. </p>
<p>Apathy, gang violence, disrespect for education, elders, and women. Hip Hop is more than rap music. It is expression, Freedom with Responsibility, communal, and goal oriented. Our Board and Executive Team are fully qualified to fulfill this engagement and carry this program to it's conclusion. We are committed to proving the value of education and Hip Hop's true worth. </p>
<p>Our Pioneers won the 70s. They defeated  gang violence and economic disenfranchisement with the only tools they had available. Music playing systems, ingenuity, persistence, perseverance, and their own bodies. Be a witness as we do it again.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We appreciate all of your consideration. We are all in different circumstances and just because you may not be able to send money now, doesn't mean you do not matter. Hip Hop survived on word of mouth! We now have social media and technology. </p>
<p>You can share our pages, blast our posts, and pump our music and videos. The more who see the fund , the more chances to reach our goal. Share our program. Call your friends, reblog, post, email, fax, rhyme about us, create a poster. However you decide, you will be assisting to spread the word. Introduce them to our program and drive them to our page.

drowning statistics in South Africa are much too high – particularly within poorer
communities where many children never have the opportunity to learn to swim.
The truth is, drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental death for
children in South Africa, and it is <b>100% preventable!</b><br/></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.lovetolanga.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Love to Langa</a> </b>is a US-based 501(c)3 charity that has taken on the vision of Philippi Children’s Centre (PCC) to build an indoor swim school
in Philippi Township, a poor farming community near Cape Town.  In accordance with
Love to Langa and PCC’s vision to teach underprivileged children and adults to swim,
Headstart Swim School will join hands with Love to Langa and operate a successful swim school within the
Philippi community, which does not have the luxury of indoor swimming facilities and
qualified instructors.  Indeed, the closest indoor pool is 15 miles away. Once completed, Headstart will train pupils and community
members to teach at the school and eventually take over the administration. </p> </div> <div> <h3>We have an opportunity to make a difference</h3> <p></p>
<p>Few disadvantaged children have ever seen a swimming pool. The parents
are unable to afford swimming lessons and many schools don’t have the resources
or facilities to offer them.</p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.lovetolanga.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b></b></a><b><a href=""http://www.lovetolanga.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Love to Langa</a></b></b>, PCC and Headstart aim to reduce the risk of drowning in farming
and urban communities near the coast by teaching underprivileged school-going
children to swim by taking them through the learn-to-swim program in a safe,
non-threatening and fun environment.</p>
<h3>The locals have stepped up so now its up to us!</h3>
<p>Many local businesses around the Cape Town and Philippi area have already committed in-kind donations for all the materials needed to build the swim academy! All that is left is for Love to Langa to raise the cost for the labor to build it!</p>
<p>Total labor cost to build a brand new swim academy is only $25,000!</p>

</div></div>","Time to Dive In! There are many children who cannot afford swimming lessons and the
drowning statistics in South Africa are much too high – particularly within poorer
communities where many children never have the opportunity to learn to swim.
The truth is, drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental death for
children in South Africa, and it is 100% preventable!
Love to Langa is a US-based 501(c)3 charity that has taken on the vision of Philippi Children’s Centre (PCC) to build an indoor swim school
in Philippi Township, a poor farming community near Cape Town.  In accordance with
Love to Langa and PCC’s vision to teach underprivileged children and adults to swim,
Headstart Swim School will join hands with Love to Langa and operate a successful swim school within the
Philippi community, which does not have the luxury of indoor swimming facilities and
qualified instructors.  Indeed, the closest indoor pool is 15 miles away. Once completed, Headstart will train pupils and community
members to teach at the school and eventually take over the administration.    We have an opportunity to make a difference 
Few disadvantaged children have ever seen a swimming pool. The parents
are unable to afford swimming lessons and many schools don’t have the resources
or facilities to offer them.
Love to Langa, PCC and Headstart aim to reduce the risk of drowning in farming
and urban communities near the coast by teaching underprivileged school-going
children to swim by taking them through the learn-to-swim program in a safe,
non-threatening and fun environment.
The locals have stepped up so now its up to us!
Many local businesses around the Cape Town and Philippi area have already committed in-kind donations for all the materials needed to build the swim academy! All that is left is for Love to Langa to raise the cost for the labor to build it!
Total labor cost to build a brand new swim academy is only $25,000!

The impact it will have on the children



It is a vital life skill


It reduces drowning
It provides a healthy lifestyle
It creates recreation for children from underprivileged communities
talented swimmers will be sponsored for further development

The Learn to Swim Program will teach the children





Water safety

Water orientation
Basic swimming strokes
Survival techniques

Pascal are two young orphaned Congolese refugee brothers living in Zambia who are trying
to achieve their education, break the cycle of violence and to help make a difference in the world. <br/></p><p>In 2012, Pierre
and Pascal’s family home in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was
attacked by militia targeting their ethnic group. Their father and mother were murdered and
Pierre and Pascal and their younger sister were
assaulted and beaten by the rebels.  In all of the commotion the two young brothers
managed to escape, slipping into the jungle and running for their lives. They
never heard from their sister again. Eventually, after months of
hiding, the brothers were smuggled into Zambia, where they were granted refugee
status.<span>  However, shortly after they
arrived Pascal was attacked by a group of youth who chased him into the heart
of the city where he became completely disoriented, lost and separated from his
brother.  Pascal lived on the streets of
Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, for over 3 months, constantly searching for his
brother. Pierre also spent endless days searching for his younger brother to no
avail.  Completely devastated, Pierre decided
to seek protection at a refugee camp and turned up at the camp where I worked
for the United Nations.  Pierre was
inconsolable about his brother’s loss, but no one believed his story or offered
him support.  However, there was
something about Pierre’s eloquence, sincerity and profound determination that I
could not ignore and I decided to help him. 
With my assistance, after only a few weeks of phone calls and searches
in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, a  local doctor informed
us that he had seen Pascal in a certain  neighbourhood and with his help a miracle
occurred; Pierre and Pascal were reunited. 
</span></p>
<p>After being
reunited, the boys lived together in a mud hut in the refugee camp where I
worked. I witnessed their profound positivity and generosity, which spread throughout 
the community.<span>  They played soccer with other youth, help
build houses for elderly refugees and made many friends. They also possessed a great intellectualism,
constantly discussing peace and conflict and the injustices of the world. They
kept up to date on world politics and the voting record of United Nations
Security Council members.  However, the
boys also were extremely discouraged. 
With no high school or college in the camp, they felt useless and unable
to rebuild their lives.  As refugees,
they were also legally barred from any employment in Zambia.  It was in this state of discouragement that I
came up with the idea of linking them with local donors in Canada, my home
country, in order to pursue their education.  <br/></span></p><p>Fate took care of the rest.  In late 2013, I found myself having dinner at my best friend's family home in Montreal when her mother, a local dedicated and passionate family physician, Dr. Jeannette Janzen, shared her desire to 'sponsor' a child as her most recent sponsored child had aged out. I immediately shared with her Pierre and Pascal's story, and right there, in between the food and dishes at the dinner table, she wrote out the first of what became countless cheques that she donated to the boys' well-being.  Not only did Dr. Janzen financially dedicate herself to Pierre and Pascal,  single-handedly paying for their shelter, food and education,  but she also quickly became 'mom', as the boys started to e-mail her with questions about adolescence, studying, jobs and everything between.  Together, the two of us became the boys' lifeline, providing financial necessities, but also moral support.  <br/></p><p>With Dr. Janzen's help Pierre and Pascal moved to  Lusaka, and re-embarked on their studies that had been so brutally interrupted in DRC.  Since 2014, a new chapter in their lives has began: Pierre has been studying in a
Foundations of Medicine program at a Zambian University and is on track to be
accepted into medical school next year- he was even recently chosen as Foreign
Student of the month, and Pascal is working hard at high school,
passing all of his classes and making many friends along the way. Not only do the boys desire to complete their studies, but they also hope to give back to their community and help change the cycle of violence that has plagued Africa. Pierre 
hopes to become a gynecologist to fight for equality and women’s
rights, and Pascal wants to be a UN Pilot, but they
need financial support to achieve their educational dreams. 
<br/></p><p><span>Dr. Janzen and I created a framework for the boys' support, formalizing the transfers and garnering the support of other dedicated local Montreal volunteers.  Together with the boys we created a budget and a plan, building on our friendship and trust, as well as my knowledge of the Zambian
economy. Every 3 months they submit a budget, and using the donations collected, I transfer money according to what has been planned in advance.  However, more
support is needed: it costs approximately $350/month to cover the boys’ basic
necessities such as food, shelter and transport, and tuition for Pierre’s university
is $2 250 per year and high school is $450 per year.  We are seeking to raise at least $24 000 in
order to help support the boys until they have completed their studies and they are able to realize their dreams. <br/></span></p><p><span>Thank you for your contributions- everything

population live in makeshift shelters. Among those people, children are obliged working for their parents, because of the cost to survive and are not enabled getting education. Most of the time, they work in factories or
construction sites where their mental and physical health is endangered.</p><p><b>II) Presentation of our project ""Vidyanikethan School""</b></p>
<p>Thanks to Sri Vidyanikethan school, the organization has an answer to this problem. It is a
Karanataka State acknowledged education institution, located in Jaraganahalli district, which
has a slum population of 12 350 people. Its goal is to
offer education to slum children, who cannot afford a public or a private
school. Between 85 and 90 % of
the 200 Vidyanikethan’s children live in Jaraganahalli’s slums. The children’s
parents are often migrants working on construction sites, as peddler on
roadsides or working in any other low-income jobs. On average, the household’s
income doesn’t exceed 3 000 rupees monthly, which represents almost 47, 21
US$. </p>

education by paying an amount of 550 rupees ( 8, 65 US$), while it is possible
for the donators to pay until 7 680 rupees (120 US$). The full sum's details

More on medium.com.I want to tell the story of an African entrepreneur's trip to the valley to attend Draper University for 8 weeks.
Make a donation , for Start-Up Education of West Africans Entrepreneurs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Qui?Née en 2012 , Wepioneer est la plateforme des Entrepreneurs des pays émergents. C’est aussi une aventure entrepreneuriale Ivoirienne au cœur des Écosystèmes Start-Up Mondial. L’Objectif de cette initiative est de transmettre et partager avec le plus grand nombre l’envie d’entreprendre par l’organisation de workshop et d’Atelier de formation gratuits. Pour cette Deuxième Edition nous 
Que comptons-nous faire ?Notre projet pour cette deuxième édition est de s’y rendre et revenir pour organiser des workshop, ateliers et conférences sur les méthodologies que nous aurons apprises la-bàs, tout en mettant en relation la silicon valley et la #FrenchtechAfrique.Par ailleurs , nous voulons au sortir de notre immersion à Draper University nous voulons  faire de #wepioneerun fellowship program pour entrepreneurs francophone dans les pays émergents avec 3 leviers à savoir :
L’information (via un blog) , La Formation (via un programme de Start-Up Education  en ligne et en présentielle) et L’immersion (Exploration dans les Ecosystèmes).Qu'est-ce qui nous motive à réaliser cette initiative ?L’analyse que nous avons faite à la suite de notre premier roadtrip dans les écosystèmes de la silicon valley, silicon halley, Silicon Cap, Silicon Savanah, nous permit de comprendre qu’il n’y a pas de connexion entre les écosystèmes matures des pays du Nord avec ceux du Sud.70% des ventures capitalist company de la silicon valley n’investissent pas en Afrique et il y’a uniquement une présence de 1% de start-up Africaines dans la silicon valley: (par exemple Dropify qui en 2013 était la première Start-Up Africaine du Programme 500Startup). Il n’existe que 3 programmes Start-up en Afrique ayant un lien fort avec la silicon valley à savoir : Savannah Fund , Mestwalter , 88mph (tous étant anglophones).Comment allons-nous procéder ?Wepionneer II aura donc plusieurs étapes à savoir :
– La campagne de crowdfunding , qui aura lieu sur un Mois , en vue de mobiliser des fonds.

– Le Hero Training , la formation d’Hero de Draper University sur une période 7 semaines.
– Le Sharing  Expérience ,l’idée est de revenir en Afrique et partager son Expérience avec les jeunes Africains , qui n’ont pas la chance d’avoir accès à ces types de formations autour de entrepreneuriat.Qui sommes-nous ?
A quoi servira la collecte ?

Il ​prend en compte les billets d'avion , les frais ​de séjour et de visa, les assurances sur ​notre matériel, les transports,​et les frais de formations de Draper University.​       ​Nous avons donc besoin de vous pour rejoindre cette belle aventure et nous aider à boucler notre budget.",5.0,1,"2 Campaigns

</p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>I am an artist/writer/actor based in
Kathmandu for the past ten years. My works have been shown widely (London,
Delhi, Doha, Kathmandu etc), my writings have appeared regularly on Frieze,
Asian Art News, Sahitya Akademi, National Book Trust, Depart, Hyperallergic
etc. I have played leading roles in English language theatre productions of
Nepal. </p>
<p>As an active member of the arts
community of Nepal I am shaken by the lack of infrastructure and support
available to the art and theatre community here. I am bringing together
respected gallerists, art critics, social workers and directors to form a fund
that will help rehabilitate and at least partially reimburse medical expenses
borne by the earthquake-devastated arts and theatre professionals of Nepal.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>You can contribute as little as USD
10 though we need to raise a minimum total of USD 3000 since we are hoping to
support at least 20 affected arts/theatre professionals ($250 each). This will
help rebuild homes, pay for medical bills and cremation rites, provide basic
support to those rendered unemployed by the quake and also help repair damaged
art/theatre spaces. </p>
<p>An advisory committee
comprising eminent gallerists, art critics, artists, social workers,
theatre directors and performers will distribute the funds to needy individuals
and organizations through : a) nomination by existing and credible art/theatre
institutions; b) direct outreach to the community.  Jennifer Higgie
(Co-Editor of Frieze), Deborah Merola (Founder-Director of One World Theatre),
Ingrid Cheron of Newa Chen, Yulia Koirala (Founder-Director Sushila Art
Academy) are on the advisory committee of this initiative.</p>
<p><b>A complete record of the funds
received and distributed will be made available online.</b></p>
<p>The more funds we receive, the more
people will receive help. But we look forward to supporting at least 20
people/families at this point.</p>
<p>Each and every contribution will be
mentioned and appreciated on our online records.</p>
<p>Contribution above USD 500 will
be awarded with a signed print of an artwork  OR a token of appreciation
from the beneficiary (artist/theatre professional/organization).</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will  help
save lives and rebuild futures of talented and brilliant art &amp; theatre
professionals who can hardly make ends meet even during normal times. Nepal is
a new republic and just recovering from a decade-long civil war, and is yet to
have a Constitution even. The art economy here is next to nonexistent and
though creative brilliance is more than abundant, its systematic promotion is
almost nil. The creative community on the other hand is large in number.This
leaves most arts/theatre professionals in a double-bind of poverty and
declining productivity. A small contribution from you will provide these
artists and performers with material relief and help them regain faith in
themselves and the possibility of a future.</p>

Aalto University had a space that was empty;


People from varying backgrounds filled said space;


Someone suggested taking 30 Aalto people to meet the 70,000 at Burning Man festival Nevada USA;


Nobody laughed at the idea;


Burning Man organisation loved the idea!;

We got a green light for an Art Installation;

Ideas were born, sparks flew and things got crazy;

Crazy turned to impossible, impossible turned into a project;
Filming of this insane journey began;

The folk lore legend: Väinämöinen (The original Gandalf) awoke from his slumber and requested an instrument worthy of him to play!


A Giant Pike Head Kantele (National Finnish Instrument) was born and we joined forces with Koistinen Kantele family (The Stradivarius of kantele's);


Our documentary permit was accepted by Burning Man;


We realised we had run out of funds and time;

Go go Indiegogo :-)

Lets start with our beautiful fish head art/instrument:We have built a prototype Pike head structure in Finland and will now have to recreate and rebuild this beast in Reno USA to be ready to ship to the desert.  This piece is our answer to the art application we successful made with Burning Man.  Now why a giant Pike head?Finland's national folk law which inspired the Lord of the rings 
mythology, speaks of a god by the name of Väinämöinen.  This bad ass 
wizard character fashioned a musical instrument from a giant Pike's jaw 
bone, the Kantele.  So to remember our storytelling roots and heritage 
we are bringing back the Pike with a modern twist.Currently all our funds have gone into the supplies, transportation and manufacturing of the Pike head.  The Pike head is made up of a precision cut plywood skeleton and a braided plywood veneer as its scales.  Our pike will be illuminated and contain solar technology to bring it to life.  Then finally the most unique part of the piece... the one of a kind hand crafted tongue instrument (Kantele).So now we should probably explain what we need this money for right :-)First off we have raised 6,000€ from Aalto University's Design Factory to get the project started, this was coupled with a lot of volunteers and endless nights. This project has been and continues to be a minefield of unknowns and unexpected  challenges.  We have to arrange transportation to and from multiple destinations with a few tonnes of material and supplies with each step of the way threatening to derail the whole project.  The costs so far for logistics and materials is just over 10,000€ However we were lucky to receive a grant of 7,500€ from TTER (Technical Student's support foundation), leaving us a current deficit of 2,500€Our Camp/Theme campKeeping the Kalevala (Finnish folk lore) theme we named our Finnish + friends, Camp: Tuonela, this means the Underworld.  At the camp we will have around 35 people sleeping and living, we must setup everything we need to survive in the desert for just over a week.  Including power, lighting, toilet facilities, cooking facilities and shade from the intense heat of the sun.Our camp will be another destination for our activities and interactions with the other desert dwellers know as Burners.  We are holding workshops, talks and musical performances there.  Aalto University's teachings and learning's can be present in the most unlikely of places :-)The camp creation, running and cleaning costs are currently at 8,000€Tickets, Travel, Accommodation and stuff to keep us aliveEach member of Aalto on Fire has personally invested an average of 3,000€, this is something we are not asking to be funded nor reimbursed as this project is one of commitment and dedication.  The Documentary!The most epic of journeys deserves to be shared to our student body but additionally to a wider audience.  We started filming on a budget of next to zero with the aim of editing a 10 - 20 min trailer type documentary for the likes of Youtube.  We successful had our application to film at Burning Man approved and then things got crazy big...YLE (Finland's national broadcast network) caught wind of our idea and suggested we join forces with Documentary film maker Oskari Pastila.  Oskari and recently joined our project and we are now going to film the entire journey in a feature length film aimed for distribution by YLE!!!!!!!!Oskari's previous work speaks for its self:http://www.knucklebonehead.comhttp://basketcase-film.com/http://www.taynnatarmoa.fihttps://vimeo.com/63230173This now gives us the ability to tell our story and hopefully inspire our students and all those out there that believe learning and development should be fun, adventurous, challenging and not without risk.Costs involved with the documentary, excluding post production are at 18,300€This leaves us with a current funding goal of 28,800€We have aimed at 25,001€ before some costs blew out however we hope we can exceed our goal and receive additional funding through grants.More updates to soon follow and we appreciate all the help and support!Some Perky pics:",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>THE STORY</b></p>
<div>I have a daughter, her name is Valentina. She is 7 years-old and is going to start the Primary school. She was born with optic nerve atrophy (ONA). This doesn't mean she is blind, the ONA is like if we had two tunnels in our eyes darkening our vision.</div>
<div>I design, produce and adapt materials and text books for her to attend to the appropriate school, one that is non exclusive for disabled children. We have the support of a group of educational specialists guided by Valentina's doctors, who are aware of her process of development.</div>
<div>Some people have the wrong impression about the concept of disability, they relate it with mental retardation. There are not different people, we are all very different.</div>
<div>Within this racist, discriminatory and class-based society, Valentina's presence in the Primary school is a valuable opportunity for everyone to gain counciosness about diversity.</div>
<div>After a long search  for the right school we finally found a Primary School that is prepared to include Valentina, the problem is that we cannot afford their prices. I felt very happy for the great discovery, but very hopeless about the possibility of my daughter continuing her education. </div>
<div>Valentina has made such a tremendous effort, that I feel I can't put an ending to her story before it begins. She has proved herself capable of going to a school that is non exclusive for disabled. This has helped her to take a step forward in her development. With this project I'm determined to build that opportunity for her.</div>
<div>Valentina is an independent, brilliant girl whose body and motor condition is not going to affect her learning in a negative way, there is no reason why she shouldn't start the Primary school this year. The money should be the last of her concernings.</div>
<div>The most important thing is to start looking for solutions.</div>
<div>I'm Mary, Valentina's mother.</div>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Valentina's project is to have the opportunity to attend the same school and classroom that the rest of the children.</span><br/></p>
<p>If Valentina recieves  trust and the proper incitement she can get as far as we, the adults, allow her.</p>
<p>The project we present is to cover a year of Valentina's education.</p>
<p><b><i>How are we going to make it</i></b></p>
<p>-Designing and producing studying materials assesed by medical and educational professionals. This materials must facilitate Valentina to deeply understand and have access to all the information. </p>
<p>-Providing her with an specialized adult to help her integrate the contents during the class-time (in spanish they call this person ""<i>a shadow</i>"").</p>
<p>-Organizing sensibilization workshops in the school about the inclusion  of all our differencies and individualities.</p>
<p>-Sharing our discoverings and achievements in a blog like a starting point to register and communicate our experience. We want to create a gathering space for other families in similar situations, with the goal of making tangible and inclusive changes to the current educational system.</p>
<p>Valentina is great example that small actions make big changes. She can set an important precedent to start building a school that reflects an inclusive society that values our little individualities.</p>

Podemos eliminar el prejuicio en nuestro país de que las personas con discapacidad no estudian.Valentina no tendría porqué no estar en la escuela primaria, la cuestión económica podría no ser un impedimento para lograrlo.Lo importante es buscar soluciones. Yo soy Mary, la mamá de Valentina. EL PROYECTOEl proyecto de Valentina es llegar al primer año de primaria teniendo acceso a la misma escuela y aula que el resto de los niños que estudian. Si Valentina recibe la confianza y los estímulos adecuados va a llegar hasta donde los adultos se lo permitamos.Cómo lo vamos a realizar – Diseñando y produciendo materiales de estudio con el asesoramiento de profesionales.  Materiales de estudio que faciliten la comprensión de Valentina y le permitan el acceso a la información.– Proveyéndole acompañamiento adulto especializado durante las horas de clase, llamado sombra o monitor dentro de la escuela. – Adaptando los libros de texto en versión accesible.– Ofreciendo talleres de sensibilización en la escuela para favorecer la tolerancia a las  diferencias.– Compartiendo nuestros logros y descubrimientos en un blog que permita registrar y comunicar la experiencia, como un punto de encuentro e inspiración para otras familias que se encuentren en una situación similar, con el objetivo de hacer mejoras educativas concretas al actual sistema educativo.Valentina es una niña con su propia manera de aprender, razón por la cual necesita un ambiente escolar apropiado, las instituciones educativas de nuestro país atraviesan un muy mal momento a nivel público. Las pequeñas acciones hacen grandes cambios. Por eso es importante que tenga una oportunidad de acudir a una escuela. Ella puede no ser una carga social cuando adulta. Ha demostrado capacidades más que discapacidades.EL PRESUPUESTO Inscripción ..................................................................................................................5500MXNMateriales ................................................................................................................23400MXNColegiatura x 10 meses con beca del 25% ...........................................31500MXN Monitor/acompañante x 10 meses.................................................................... 41500MXNTOTAL......................................................................................................................101900MXNCÓMO PUEDES PARTICIPARTu presencia en éste proyecto es clave para alcanzar la meta de Valentina.

A SHADOW FOR VALENTINA


THE STORY
I have a daughter, her name is Valentina. She is 7 years-old and is going to start the Primary school. She was born with optic nerve atrophy (ONA). This doesn't mean she is blind, the ONA is like if we had two tunnels in our eyes darkening our vision.
I design, produce and adapt materials and text books for her to attend to the appropriate school, one that is non exclusive for disabled children. We have the support of a group of educational specialists guided by Valentina's doctors, who are aware of her process of development.
Some people have the wrong impression about the concept of disability, they relate it with mental retardation. There are not different people, we are all very different.
Within this racist, discriminatory and class-based society, Valentina's presence in the Primary school is a valuable opportunity for everyone to gain counciosness about diversity.
After a long search  for the right school we finally found a Primary School that is prepared to include Valentina, the problem is that we cannot afford their prices. I felt very happy for the great discovery, but very hopeless about the possibility of my daughter continuing her education. 
Valentina has made such a tremendous effort, that I feel I can't put an ending to her story before it begins. She has proved herself capable of going to a school that is non exclusive for disabled. This has helped her to take a step forward in her development. With this project I'm determined to build that opportunity for her.
Valentina is an independent, brilliant girl whose body and motor condition is not going to affect her learning in a negative way, there is no reason why she shouldn't start the Primary school this year. The money should be the last of her concernings.
The most important thing is to start looking for solutions.
I'm Mary, Valentina's mother.




THE PROJECT
Valentina's project is to have the opportunity to attend the same school and classroom that the rest of the children.
If Valentina recieves  trust and the proper incitement she can get as far as we, the adults, allow her.
The project we present is to cover a year of Valentina's education.
How are we going to make it
-Designing and producing studying materials assesed by medical and educational professionals. This materials must facilitate Valentina to deeply understand and have access to all the information. 
-Providing her with an specialized adult to help her integrate the contents during the class-time (in spanish they call this person ""a shadow"").
-Organizing sensibilization workshops in the school about the inclusion  of all our differencies and individualities.
-Sharing our discoverings and achievements in a blog like a starting point to register and communicate our experience. We want to create a gathering space for other families in similar situations, with the goal of making tangible and inclusive changes to the current educational system.
Valentina is great example that small actions make big changes. She can set an important precedent to start building a school that reflects an inclusive society that values our little individualities.

<div>Our goal with this campaign is simple. To show as much financial support as we can for each family directly affected as a result of the act of domestic terrorism in Chattanooga. Should a family not wish for the financial support we will make a donation in the fallen Hero's honor to a charity of the families choosing. Our goal is to raise enough money so that the victims families can each receive $25,000.</div>
<div>The names of the Men and Woman we are focusing on helping:</div>
<div></div>The Marines killed were Carson Holmquist, David Wyatt, Skip Wells and Thomas J. Sullivan. There is also a female Seaman alive but in critical condition we intend to donate to as well.<div><br/></div> <p></p>
<p>The following taken from FoxNews.com:</p>
<p>""It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion,"" Obama said.</p>
<p>The gunman first shot up a recruiting center before driving to the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center and killing four Marines before he was shot, authorities said.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Our goal with this campaign is simple. To show as much financial support as we can for each family directly affected as a result of the act of domestic terrorism in Chattanooga. Should a family not wish for the financial support we will make a donation in the fallen Hero's honor to a charity of the families choosing. Our goal is to raise enough money so that the victims families can each receive $25,000.
The names of the Men and Woman we are focusing on helping:
The Marines killed were Carson Holmquist, David Wyatt, Skip Wells and Thomas J. Sullivan. There is also a female Seaman alive but in critical condition we intend to donate to as well. 
The following taken from FoxNews.com:
""It is a heartbreaking circumstance for these individuals who have served our country with great valor to be killed in this fashion,"" Obama said.
The gunman first shot up a recruiting center before driving to the Navy Operational Support Center and Marine Corps Reserve Center and killing four Marines before he was shot, authorities said. Sources told Fox News police chased the gunman from the recruiting center to the Center, where the killings took place.
A well-placed source in Chattanooga told Fox News that one of the Marines who was killed was a ""decorated war hero with two Purple Hearts."" The youngest was 19 years old, the source said.
The U.S. Navy said late Thursday a wounded female sailor was in surgery after being shot.


    The Impact The family of a fallen Hero often find themselves caught in a financial bind. The DOD does a lot to attempt to alleviate as much of the pressure as they can, but often cannot release funds quickly enough, or the compensation is not enough. Beyond this the family is shouldered with a lasting burden of not having a loved one there on a day to day basis. They will have to see their pictures on the mantle, and remember every day they can no longer be with them. Can we help them? Only a little. But sometimes doing what you 'can' is all you can do. 

    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  You can spread this far and wide throughout social media. What we raise together that the families do not need, we will donate to charities of their choosing.

<p>Naismith Legacy Giving
is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to telling the Naismith story and
reaching young people through the game of basketball. There are countless
stories we have heard from people telling us how basketball changed their lives
and in many cases actually saved their lives. We want to continue to impact
young people’s lives in a positive way by teaching the positive life principles
that Dr. Naismith taught. In doing so, we can carry on his legacy of leaving
the world a better place for those who follow us.</p>
<p>We at Naismith Legacy
Giving believe the best platform for this movement is through youth sports. It
is unfortunate, but there are many messages coming through youth sports that
are the wrong message. The win at all cost mentality is not the right
approach.  We should pursue victory with honor.  There is a lack of
respect and sportsmanship in youth sports today that must change. Adults
sometimes fall into this trap and lose focus of what youth sports should really
be about.  Parents, coaches and officials, have a responsibility to young
players to make sure that we have the proper view and perspective of youth
sports so we can teach them the right way to approach their life and
competition. How do we do this? We believe it is a grass roots movement as it
was back in 1936, when pennies were collected to help pay Dr. Naismith's way to
the Olympics, where basketball would be played for the first time. Naismith
Legacy Giving is asking for donations for our Charitable Giving organization
that will enable us to produce the materials and fund operations for the two
programs listed below.</p>
<p><b>Naismith Legacy Way</b></p>
<p>Dr. Naismith was a
teacher for most of his life, therefore he believed education was important. In
addition to teaching topical subjects like Physical Education, he also taught
the life skills of good character by consistently using words to make his
point.  Words like Respect, Integrity, Family, Generosity, Service,
Discernment, Honor and 14 others that he based his life on.  He not only
said the words, he lived by their definition. He modeled them.</p><p></p><p>                                            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439307243/y64oznpkw26f2wkrvtsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>We
have taken those words and created a small, easy to use booklet that coaches
can use with their young players as a teaching tool. The booklets are
interactive, asking the players to answer questions, view YouTube videos and
engage in discussions that will help them think how to make decisions that will
have a positive impact on their lives and others around them.</p>
<p>There are three
separate booklets each featuring seven words for a total of 21 words. This
provides three years of learning material that coaches and players can
use.  We are looking for donations to help us produce these booklets so we
can give them to basketball coaches in city recreation programs, YMCA league
programs and other youth basketball organizations.</p>
<p><b>The Naismith Tour -
Basketball: Its Origin and Development</b></p>
<p>This is a traveling
exhibit showing historical pictures and memorabilia telling the story of Dr.
Naismith’s game of basketball.  Copies of the Original 13 Rules, pictures
of the original gym at the YMCA Training Center where the first game was
played, and other interesting displays about the development of the game.</p>
<p>We get requests to
bring this Tour to special events ranging from the ACC Conference Championships
to local Parks &amp; Recreation and YMCA events. At YMCA’s and local recreation
programs we have a program called Naismith Days using the Naismith Legacy Tour
as the basis for presenting the story of basketball to players, coaches,
officials and parents.  As an additional part of the day, we also offer
free workshops for Parents, Coaches and Officials to learn how to view youth
sports in the 21st century.</p>
<p>This integrates with
the Naismith Legacy Way to reach young people, their parents and coaches and
try to change the way they view youth sports today.  The mixed messages
that youth sports is sending today are confusing and we believe we can offer a
clear prospective to all of the participants, but we need help to get that
done.</p>
<p>The next generation of
Naismith's want to carry on the Legacy of Dr. Naismith by reaching out through
youth sports to make our young people aware of the man who invented basketball,
but more importantly the life he lived to make our world a better place. Our
young people are at risk today and our goal is to lessen that risk by offering
a solid platform for them to learn. We know that basketball has changed people
in a positive way. We want to be proactive rather than reactive. We are not a

This is exactly what those of us at
Project Read spend our days striving to fight and ultimately fix. Improving
adult literacy in central Kentucky, one student at a time. 
Who We Are



We are Project Read and our goal is
to improve adult literacy in Madison County, Kentucky. This year, we celebrate
our 30th anniversary of teaching adults to read and/or improve their reading
levels, free of charge. In addition, we offer tutoring to improve
English-speaking skills for those for whom English is not their first language.
Project Read is the only significant organization in Madison County to provide
these individualized services to adult learners, many of whom are at the lowest
literacy levels. All of our tutors are unpaid, trained volunteers who enjoy
making a contribution to the community by donating their time and expertise. In addition to our dedicated Executive Director, our Governing Board is comprised of local educators, business people, and
well-known members of the community, working for a worthy and vital cause.
How You Can Help


Project Read is totally dependent on
contributions. Our budget would probably be considered modest by most
standards, but one of our main sources of funding, United Way of the Bluegrass,
changed its focus this year to support only K through 12 educational programs.
While many foundations provide grants that support K-12 literacy projects, few
support adult literacy programs. Rather than see this as a major setback, we
instead embrace this as a unique opportunity to reach out, show the world the
good we're doing and hope to continue to do, and involve the community in ways
we'd only dreamt of before. This is where we need your help.
Our goal this year is to obtain $15,000 to
maintain our current programs and to meet increasing needs and numbers of
students. The money raised will be used to keep our doors open and lights on—to
buy books and materials as well as to pay the rent and utilities.
Our door is the only significant one
open to adults in Madison County who want to improve their basic literacy
skills. Your contribution will make a difference in someone's life—a small
price for a great difference.

How We - And You - Make a Difference


Recently two sisters in their 20s
earned their GEDs. Now, for the first time in their lives, they have well
paying jobs and are more engaged citizens of Madison County. One woman in her
40s who was told she would never learn to read is now at the fourth-grade level
and is still improving. These are just a few of the success stories from
Project Read. Project Read truly does make a difference in improving literacy
in Kentucky.
Our local supporters and
contributors are finding it difficult to keep up with the growing needs of
Project Read. The population in Madison County is growing faster than Kentucky
as a whole (3.2% vs. 1.3%), and Project Read needs to expand its vital literacy
services to meet the growing demand. Currently, we serve only a small fraction of
the 3,000 people who speak another language at home. And those who do not
complete high school (about 30 percent) are finding us, one by one, asking for
help.
Your contribution goes toward many
things:


Keeping the lights on and doors open
by paying our rent and utilities


Growing our client base and
advertising our services


Replacing out-of-date equipment,
such as our aging copy machine


Adding to and replenishing our
collection of textbooks, dictionaries, and learning software programs


Conclusion

Ensuring that all adults have the
opportunity to become literate is good for everyone—you, me, and the person
improving his/her skills. Higher levels of literacy help us be better employees
and open up new job opportunities. Because literacy helps us stay informed, it
makes us valuable as citizens of our communities. Literacy lowers unemployment

opens the door to a whole new world. Help us continue to make this new world

<p>At the start of November, two teams of students at Community High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan began working to formulate a compelling case on both the plaintiff and defense sides of a fictional trial. Mock Trial is a demanding activity that requires students to develop their skills in public speaking, critical thinking and thinking on their feet. </p>
<p>The students put in <i>countless hours</i>--coming into school on days off and staying well past their bedtimes--to develop, memorize, and practice their roles as lawyers, witnesses, and sometimes both. As witnesses, students play sympathetic defendants, slighted plaintiffs and unbiased third parties. Lawyers deliver openings and closings and object to hearsay and testimony that is more prejudicial than probative. They find out just before the trial which side they will be presenting and must be prepared to think on their feet in order to respond to everything the opposing team delivers. The skills learned and the confidence gained is hard to quantify. </p> <p>All that effort paid off in March at the Ann Arbor Regional Tournament when both A Team and B Team moved on to compete in Lansing later that month at the state competition. There, at the end of a very long day and after going head-to-head with the best teams from around Michigan four separate times (including the semifinal round where our teams faced off with one another!), the students on B Team took Fourth Place and A Team brought the State Championship trophy home to Community. </p>

In March 2014 Sign Health research revealed a shocking story of unintentional neglect, shortened lives and wasted money. It revealed that potentially life-threatening health conditions are being missed, and poor treatment is offered when a diagnosis is made. It’s unfair and unjust that its due to being Deaf.  Reference; www.signhealth.org.uk/health-information/sick-of-it-report/
Being cut off socially often contributes to strong feelings of isolation. Hearing loss means a higher risk of mental illnesses such as depression or dementia.
Deaf Access have run  successful Comic relief and lottery projects. We've done cross borough working contributing to the development of deaf parenting materials used nationally today. 

Imagine having no voice. No access to services or support because nobody can understand you or sign to include you. Many cannot even communicate with their own families. This project will offer empowerment & independence. 
Risks & Challenges
 Deaf people are isolated by barriers to communication, sometimes even by their families- who seek to protect them. Many feel angry - feeling society has failed them, written them off.  Getting their trust and reaching those in minority groups is a huge challenge. 


 We need to produce more deaf friendly signed information clips.

Leaflets and information that include different minority groups  Go to ethnic & minotity communities raising awareness to reach doubly isolated deaf people.    Other Ways You Can Help Maybe you can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please can you get the word out and make some noise about our work? Can you use the Indiegogo share tools?

<p>To save a valued piece of American History! At 88 years, The Delta Queen is the oldest authentic overnight steamboat in America. She steamed through America's Waterways for 80 years until overnight cruise service was suspended in 2008. In 2009, she docked in Chattanooga, TN where she served<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> as a dockside hotel until January 2014. For just over a year, the Delta Queen has remained vacant in Chattanooga while awaiting new ownership that would determine the next chapter in her majestic life. During her time in Chattanooga some parts of the vessel have deteriorated and are in desperate need of repair. The new owners of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company aim to preserve, protect and restore the Delta Queen to her former grandeur and return her to overnight cruise service on America's inland rivers. The Delta Queen has been towed from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Houma, Louisiana where she will undergo a complete restoration. But we need your help!</span></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>THE HISTORY: <br/>
</h3>
<p>
The Delta Queen is an overnight cruise vessel that first entered
service in 1927 carrying passengers, cargo and automobiles between Sacramento
and San Francisco, CA. In 1940 she was pressed into military service, painted
battleship grey, and carried soldiers from the docks in San Francisco to Navy ships
anchored in San Francisco Bay. It is said that the Delta Queen carried the first
wounded soldiers returning from Pearl Harbor from arriving ships anchored in San Francisco Bay <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to the docks. Also, the first meeting of what eventually became the United Nations was
held on board the Delta Queen while she was still in military service. After WWII, the Delta Queen was sold as war
surplus to Capt. Tom Greene, owner of the Greene Line Steamers from Cincinnati,
OH. Capt. Greene had the Delta Queen towed from San Francisco through the Panama
Canal to New Orleans. From New Orleans, she steamed under her own power to

</p>
<p>In 2009, the Delta Queen steamed up to Chattanooga, TN and became a
dockside hotel. She operated as a hotel until January of 2014. On February 17,
2015 a group of loyal supporters and long time fans of the Delta Queen
purchased the vessel and recreated the Delta Queen Steamboat Company. The
mission of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company is to protect, preserve and
restore the legendary Steamboat and to return her to overnight cruise service. </p>
<p>The Delta Queen is a
National Historic Landmark, is listed on the National Register of Historic
Places, is in the National Maritime Hall of Fame, and in September of 2013 was
designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as a National Treasure,
an honor given to the most elite of our National Historic Landmarks. The Delta
Queen has carried Presidents, Royalty and celebrities on America’s inland
waterways over the decades, but more importantly, she has given hundreds of
thousands of Americans and international visitors alike an opportunity to see much of our great country from the decks of an authentic 1927 steam driven paddlewheeler.
Passengers on board the Delta Queen literally step back in time and relive the
era of Mark Twain and his famous characters of river lore. The Delta Queen is
an important part of our national history and cannot be lost. <br/></p>

<h3>THE ROYAL VISION:</h3>
<p>The first goal
of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company and the many fans and supporters of the
Delta Queen is to protect, preserve and restore this National Treasure. We need
your help to save the Legendary Delta Queen. This first campaign is intended to
raise money to repair and renovate her 88 cabins and public spaces which have
fallen into disrepair during the last 15 months since the Delta Queen Hotel was
shut down in Chattanooga, TN. The
monies will be used to repair the roof on the sun deck which has numerous leaks which have caused rain damage in a number of cabins. The decks will be redone to
eliminate leaks on each level. Wood damaged by those leaks will be repaired. Her
air conditioning and heating systems will be repaired or replaced as needed.
Her rails will be fully restored. Carpeting will be replaced and furnishings
either replaced or reupholstered returning her cabins and public spaces to the
elegance and glory of her earlier years. </p>
<p>This restoration will take place in two phases. This first
campaign is intended to fund the restoration of the hotel side of the vessel
and is expected to cost 1.5 million dollars. Phase two, a complete restoration
of the marine side of the vessel is expected to cost nearly 4 million dollars.
If we were to be fortunate enough to exceed our goal in phase one, any
additional monies raised will be used to begin funding phase two. </p>

<h3>THE CHALLENGE:</h3>
<p>Prior to 1966, there were several disasters resulting from fires on wooden cruise ships far out in the ocean.  In response, Congress passed the Safety at Sea Act which
prohibited vessels carrying more than 49 overnight passengers from operating in
US waters unless they were made completely of non-combustible materials.  The intent of the law was to prohibit ocean going cruise ships made of wood from entering US ports. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unfortunately, the 1966
law also affected the Delta Queen which was the only overnight cruise vessel
operating on the inland rivers of America at that time. While the Delta Queen has a </span>steel<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> hull, the hotel part of the vessel is made mostly of wood, but unlike ocean going cruise ships far out at sea, the Delta Queen is never more than a few 100 yards from shore. Recognizing the error, Congress immediately
passed a law exempting the Delta Queen from the Safety at Sea Act. That
exemption was renewed 9 times over the next 40 years. During her more than 80
years of overnight cruise service the Delta Queen carried hundreds of thousands
of passengers safely.  In spite of her safety record, in 2008 the owners of
the Delta Queen were unable to secure a renewal of the exemption which led to
the Delta Queen leaving the overnight cruise service at the end of October
2008.</span></p>
<p>While the restoration of the hotel side of the Delta Queen
is getting underway the new leaders of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company will also
focus on securing  a new
Congressional exemption to allow the Delta Queen to return to overnight cruise
service. While we remain confident in our ability to secure a new Congressional
Exemption, if we are unable to get Congress to pass the exemption, it is still important that we protect and preserve the Delta Queen. Unfortunately, no commercial financing will be available to fund our preservation effort until the Congressional Exemption is approved.  Until then, we must rely solely on contributions from those of you who want to help to save a our Queen.  </p>

To save a valued piece of American History! At 88 years, The Delta Queen is the oldest authentic overnight steamboat in America. She steamed through America's Waterways for 80 years until overnight cruise service was suspended in 2008. In 2009, she docked in Chattanooga, TN where she served as a dockside hotel until January 2014. For just over a year, the Delta Queen has remained vacant in Chattanooga while awaiting new ownership that would determine the next chapter in her majestic life. During her time in Chattanooga some parts of the vessel have deteriorated and are in desperate need of repair. The new owners of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company aim to preserve, protect and restore the Delta Queen to her former grandeur and return her to overnight cruise service on America's inland rivers. The Delta Queen has been towed from Chattanooga, Tennessee to Houma, Louisiana where she will undergo a complete restoration. But we need your help!


The Iconic Paddlewheel of The Delta Queen 

THE HISTORY: 


The Delta Queen is an overnight cruise vessel that first entered
service in 1927 carrying passengers, cargo and automobiles between Sacramento
and San Francisco, CA. In 1940 she was pressed into military service, painted
battleship grey, and carried soldiers from the docks in San Francisco to Navy ships
anchored in San Francisco Bay. It is said that the Delta Queen carried the first
wounded soldiers returning from Pearl Harbor from arriving ships anchored in San Francisco Bay to the docks. Also, the first meeting of what eventually became the United Nations was
held on board the Delta Queen while she was still in military service. After WWII, the Delta Queen was sold as war
surplus to Capt. Tom Greene, owner of the Greene Line Steamers from Cincinnati,
OH. Capt. Greene had the Delta Queen towed from San Francisco through the Panama
Canal to New Orleans. From New Orleans, she steamed under her own power to
Pittsburgh, PA where she was fully restored as an overnight cruise vessel. The
Delta Queen returned to overnight cruise service in 1947 carrying passengers on the Ohio, Mississippi, Illinois, Tennessee, Cumberland, Arkansas and other Rivers and Waterways throughout America's Heartland and Deep South until 2008.

In a small rural village in Ghana, Offinso, there is a open and free school for orphans, disabled children and kids whose parents don't have the money to pay for their education.

It currently has about 250 children and even more families profit from it. The many ways in which this community profits from the school are uncountable, but sadly, it still struggles to find funds for new projects.

time goes by, the fatalities will inevitably increase.  We know most of 
our staff our safe, but still haven’t heard from a couple in Kathmandu 
or our board members.  It will be a while before we hear of how the 
earthquake has impacted our communities, families, schools and students.
  As we get details we will formulate our response, regardless of its 
through a Namlo-organized relief effort, or us passing resources on to 
other relief organizations.</p>
<p><strong>One thing is clear:  urgent help is needed.  Your contribution will help save lives!</strong></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong><i>A letter from Namlo's Executive Director, Keith Frausto:</i><br/></strong></p><p><i>By now, you have probably heard about the <b>devastating earthquake in Nepal</b>,
 the tragic loss of life, the destruction of homes, roads, 
infrastructure and historical sites.  This is the type of tragedy from 
which it will take Nepal years to recover...and the disaster is still 
unfolding.</i></p><i>
</i><p><i>As the hours, days and weeks pass by, the number of dead and injured will continue to rise, and there are <b>countless communities outside of Kathmandu with which there has been no contact</b>, communities that for all intents and purposes are cut off from help that is critically needed; communities such as <b>Dhuskun, Yarmasing, and Sabhung,</b>
 where Namlo has had a presence, building schools and sustainable 
communities over the years since 1999.  Or in communities such as Mankha
 or Arunodaya where Namlo has just started to begin to work.</i></p><i>
</i><p><i>Reports from the field, while very limited, indicate that there has been <b>significant destruction in Dhuskun, Mankha and possibly Yarmasing.</b> 
 While information from the field is very spotty, one thing is clear to 
me:  the only help some of these communities will receive will be the 
help we can bring, and what we can mobilize from supporters like you, 
working to provide resources to our field staff on the ground.</i></p><i>
</i><p><i>As I write this, our first
 priority is the safety and security of our staff, who thankfully have 
all survived the earthquake.  It may be that they too are in need of 
assistance before they can mobilize support for others.  In any case, 
our staff are resourceful, resilient and very capable, and will do 
whatever they can to save lives and help begin the rebuilding process.  </i></p><i>
</i><p><i>When the landslide hit the
 Mankha area in Sindhupalchowk last year, we received donations to help 
Namlo mobilize the 33 members of the Dhuskun Women’s Cooperative to play
 a direct role in delivering urgent relief supplies in the affected 
communities that were literally down the road from them.  Now they are 
the ones in need, and with your support, we can begin delivering relief

Please donate to help relief victims! All donations to Namlo are tax-deductible, and will go directly to relief efforts.Thousands have been killed, and more injured. As 
time goes by, the fatalities will inevitably increase.  We know most of 
our staff our safe, but still haven’t heard from a couple in Kathmandu 
or our board members.  It will be a while before we hear of how the 
earthquake has impacted our communities, families, schools and students.
  As we get details we will formulate our response, regardless of its 
through a Namlo-organized relief effort, or us passing resources on to 
other relief organizations.
One thing is clear:  urgent help is needed.  Your contribution will help save lives!A letter from Namlo's Executive Director, Keith Frausto:By now, you have probably heard about the devastating earthquake in Nepal,
 the tragic loss of life, the destruction of homes, roads, 
infrastructure and historical sites.  This is the type of tragedy from 
which it will take Nepal years to recover...and the disaster is still 
unfolding.
As the hours, days and weeks pass by, the number of dead and injured will continue to rise, and there are countless communities outside of Kathmandu with which there has been no contact, communities that for all intents and purposes are cut off from help that is critically needed; communities such as Dhuskun, Yarmasing, and Sabhung,
 where Namlo has had a presence, building schools and sustainable 
communities over the years since 1999.  Or in communities such as Mankha
 or Arunodaya where Namlo has just started to begin to work.
Reports from the field, while very limited, indicate that there has been significant destruction in Dhuskun, Mankha and possibly Yarmasing. 
 While information from the field is very spotty, one thing is clear to 
me:  the only help some of these communities will receive will be the 
help we can bring, and what we can mobilize from supporters like you, 
working to provide resources to our field staff on the ground.
As I write this, our first
 priority is the safety and security of our staff, who thankfully have 
all survived the earthquake.  It may be that they too are in need of 
assistance before they can mobilize support for others.  In any case, 
our staff are resourceful, resilient and very capable, and will do 
whatever they can to save lives and help begin the rebuilding process.  
When the landslide hit the
 Mankha area in Sindhupalchowk last year, we received donations to help 
Namlo mobilize the 33 members of the Dhuskun Women’s Cooperative to play
 a direct role in delivering urgent relief supplies in the affected 
communities that were literally down the road from them.  Now they are 
the ones in need, and with your support, we can begin delivering relief 
supplies so they can help their community survive this ordeal.
In disasters such as 
these, the communities that are far from the center of action are 
frequently the last to receive help -- sometimes not at all.  We can’t 
let that happen. You, too, can be directly involved in the rebuilding 
process by helping us launch re-construction programs in our remote 
communities. Namlo will be in these communities long after the relief 
operations in Kathmandu are finished, continuing to help with eduation, 
economic development, women's empowerment, and infrastructure building. 
 Thanks for your support -- and don't forget to forward this to anyone 
who you think might want to donate too!

been working extremely hard to develop an expertise in the conception and creation of playgrounds in limited
spaces. One of our first studies carried out on site shows that a majority of children '' play '' in some unhealthy and
unsecure areas and lack recreation resources. Currently, only the teenagers from the neighbourhood can benefit
from a soccer field, which was laid in 2013 under the program Jalousie Color, a program set up by the Haitian
government in collaboration with the United Nations. The two schools located close to the playgrounds spaces, lack proper infrastructure. During recess, many
children end up playing on the sidewalks and the main road, finding themselves dangerously stock in hectic
traffic, and trade stands.
Not only are a child’s well-being and development questioned in this context, but so is a child’s safety. As part of our program to create playground areas, we have mandated Casque Noir’s architects as well as two
engineers, including a member of COGEC. Since 2013, we have been helping the youth of Jalousie and students from the College Regina Assumpta in
Montreal cooperate in order to work on the creative process of these playground. Cooperation is essential to our
project for our organization is based primarily on learning through educational exchange, which develops
through concrete skills transfer. Our exhibitions at La TOHU and our television interviews demonstrate our interest in education, based on the
values of integrity, transparency, humility, and mutual support : http://ici.radio-canada.ca/emissions/rdi_week_end/2014-2015/entrevue.asp?idDoc=359977We have now reached the end of our development plan. These proposals are concrete and measurable.
That’s why we wish to implement, in collaboration with the COGEC, the construction of a first playground. Our estimated budget is 7000 dollars USD including the cost of materials on site, labor, the painting of the
ground and the final design. As part of this project, dedicated to the children of Jalousie, we would like to ask your financial support.Again, I wish to thank you !Nathalie ClaudeChairwoman of the board & founder------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEULEMENT 5$ POUR RECEVOIR PLEIN DE SOURIRES !Dans le but d’améliorer les conditions de vie des enfants quotidiennement exposés à des espaces réduits et qui n’ont accès à aucun loisir, l'Organisation Casque noir (OSBL - NEQ : 1170192992) basée sur Montréal se donne comme mission de travailler sur l’absence de jeux ludiques ou d’espaces récréatifs aménagés et adaptés aux plus jeunes dans le quartierJalousie à Port-au-Prince (Haïti).Tous les membres de l'équipe sont des professionnels bénévoles (architectes, enseignants, gestionnaire) et aucun frais administratif n'est déduit des financement reçus. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------LA PARTICULARITÉ DU QUARTIER JALOUSIE À PORT-AU-PRINCE (HAÏTI)Quartier informel construit sur les hauteurs de le commune de Pétion-Ville (Port-au-Prince) / 80 000 habitants / considéré comme le 3e plus grand bidonville de Port-au-Prince

Si bien la segunda de estas 10 políticas sugería el gasto publico en subsidios en puntos clave para el desarrollo, servicios favorables para los pobres, educación, salud e infraestructura^1; la práctica histórica de dichas instituciones y su constante insistencia en tres ejes fundamentales, ""privatización"", ""austeridad"" y ""desregulación"", han conducido al uso general de la frase para referirse a políticas de libre mercado, de fundamentalismo de mercado, o simplemente de carácter neoliberal.<br/><br/>
Joseph Stiglitz^2, explica: ""Es un consenso formado entre calle 15 y la calle 19 en Washington entre miembros del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), el Banco Mundial y el Departamento del Tesoro de los Estados Unidos. Argumentaba que las claves para el éxito en los países en vías de desarrollo eran 3 cosas: estabilidad-macro-económica, liberalización (reducción de las tarifas barrera^3 y regulación del mercado) y privatización""^4.<br/><br/>
Por su parte la enciclopedia ""bitannica""^5 explica el termino de la siguiente manera:  ""un conjunto de prescripciones de políticas defendidas por economistas neoliberales para que los países en vías de desarrollo alcancen el crecimiento económico"" y continua con la observación siguiente, ""criticos del consenso de Whashington han argumentado que en la práctica tales políticas están siendo utilizadas por corporaciones de los países más ricos como los Estados Unidos para explotar a los trabajadores de países mas pobres. Esto no es de menor importancia - ya que activistas e investigadores por igual han remarcado- los mercados no son en realidad ni libres, ni justos. Por ejemplo, generosos subsidios pagados a los productores de algodón en los Estados Unidos y en la Unión Europea artificialmente conducen los precios a la baja, amenazando el sustento de campesinos africanos dedicados al algodón"" para concluir de la forma siguiente: ""Para muchos críticos el problema no es por lo tanto la liberación de los mercados per se, sino que los países más ricos están haciendo trampa en el juego que exportan al resto del mundo""^6.<br/><br/>

<p>This year, we are going to conduct our mentorship program at <i>Ward 25 Binh Thanh</i> <i>District Gratitude Universal School</i> at L3A, Lot J, Tan Cang
Residential, Ward 25, Binh Thanh District, Hochiminh City, Vietnam. After our
visit to the school and having a conversation with Mrs. Doan, who is the
founder of this school, we realized that most
of the students there are abandoned and orphan children. They are seriously
lack of love, concern, and support from their family. Due to the lack of
nurturing and educating, they have to frequently cope with many accumulative
difficulties, and also face many risks and abuses in their own community.
Therefore, we would like to continuously conduct the mentorship program this
year at this school in order to connect those so-called vulnerable children
with our mentors, who have positive perspectives and lifestyles, excellent
social skills and also are full of humanity. Through the program, we want to enhance
their psychosocial well-being, empower them, help to form their trust in
community and develop their capabilities. Moreover, conducting this program we aim
to raise awareness among the Vietnamese youth of effectively dealing with
social issue existing within their own community.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436491623/az0jxz65t76pakt6m6r3.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 634.448669201521px; height: 412px; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p>P.2.

indirectly contribute to the community. </p>
<p>-
Most of our volunteers are university students, who still depend on the
economic support from their own family, thus your donation not only helps to
support them in term of economics but also plays a role as a motivation for our
volunteers to keep their commitment with the program during an entire year.</p>

Your contribution enables us to organize more activities among mentors and
mentees, which will contribute to the strong connection among all the members and
decide the effectiveness of the program.  </p>

Nguyen and Cuong Nguyen from Vietnam. We are currently second-year-students at
Asian University for Women (AUW), Chittagong, Bangladesh.
Last year, we
and other 5 students of AUW had come back Vietnam and did a summer project
named “Promoting
Well-being of Vietnamese Orphans: Changing Attitudes of Domestic Adoption and
Initiating Mentorship Program in Vietnam,” which is advised by Associate
Professor Dr. Sharon M. Flicker and sponsored by AUW. 
The mentorship program is one of the important parts of our
project. It has taken place on 12 blind children with 8 mentors at Huynh De Nhu Nghia Gratitude House from
August 2014 till now, and it is going to officially end in August 2015. On 29th
May, we had done an evaluation among all of our mentees to assess how the
program has benefited them, and the result is very positive, you may click on
this link: http://bit.ly/1UF8Q2u to see our summary from the
evaluation. 

P.1. Group
activity of our mentors and mentees
Receiving those very positive results, we are strongly motivated
to continue the mentorship program to help more disabled, abandoned and orphan
children in Vietnam. To know more about the details of our mentorship program (background,
aim, resources and training, activities and schedule), please click here: http://bit.ly/1Uk8y0E
This year, we are going to conduct our mentorship program at Ward 25 Binh Thanh District Gratitude Universal School at L3A, Lot J, Tan Cang
Residential, Ward 25, Binh Thanh District, Hochiminh City, Vietnam. After our
visit to the school and having a conversation with Mrs. Doan, who is the
founder of this school, we realized that most
of the students there are abandoned and orphan children. They are seriously
lack of love, concern, and support from their family. Due to the lack of
nurturing and educating, they have to frequently cope with many accumulative
difficulties, and also face many risks and abuses in their own community.
Therefore, we would like to continuously conduct the mentorship program this
year at this school in order to connect those so-called vulnerable children
with our mentors, who have positive perspectives and lifestyles, excellent
social skills and also are full of humanity. Through the program, we want to enhance
their psychosocial well-being, empower them, help to form their trust in
community and develop their capabilities. Moreover, conducting this program we aim
to raise awareness among the Vietnamese youth of effectively dealing with
social issue existing within their own community.P.2. Some
students at the Ward 25 Binh Thanh District Gratitude Universal School (From: http://tuoitre.vn/tin/giao-duc/20090114/ngoi-truong-tu-can-nha-bo-hoang/297516.html )

Why
should you donate?
- As
a volunteering program, your support will definitely help us to maintain the
program, which will benefit community in general and the children at Ward 25 Binh Thanh District Gratitude
Universal School in particular. Therefore, your donation will allow you to
indirectly contribute to the community. 
-
Most of our volunteers are university students, who still depend on the
economic support from their own family, thus your donation not only helps to
support them in term of economics but also plays a role as a motivation for our
volunteers to keep their commitment with the program during an entire year.
-
Your contribution enables us to organize more activities among mentors and
mentees, which will contribute to the strong connection among all the members and
decide the effectiveness of the program.  
Our
goal is 3548$,

<p>jueves 26 de febrero de 2015 12:00 AM</p>
</div>
<p>""El asesinato de un estudiante de 14 años en Táchira a manos de un funcionario de la Policía Nacional Bolivariana durante una manifestación, además de conmocionar a la opinión pública, según directivos de Cecodap, pone en tela de juicio el uso proporcional de la fuerza policial con la utilización de armas letales en protestas callejeras.<br/><br/>De acuerdo con un informe estadístico que maneja la referida organización de los 912 niños y adolescentes asesinados en el país <b>durante el año pasado, 126 de los homicidios fueron perpetrados por efectivos policiales y castrenses, lo que representa 13,8% del total de los asesinatos reportados</b>.<br/><br/>El 80% de las muertes a manos de efectivos fueron producto enfrentamientos policiales, mientras que el 20% restante respondió a ajusticiamientos. <br/><br/>Fernando Pereira, coordinador general de la referida organización, destacó que el número de casos de jóvenes muertos por esta causa experimentó un incremento 55,5%, respecto a 2013 cuando hubo 70. Estos datos se desprenden de una investigación hemerográfica que implicó la consulta de 43 medios impresos, tanto de circulación nacional y regional. <br/><br/>""Urge someter a revisión la resolución del Ministerio de la Defensa sobre el uso de armas mortales en manifestaciones. Los funcionarios de seguridad deberían usar el diálogo para dirimir conflictos. Lo ocurrido en San Cristóbal con el joven de 14 años fue abuso de poder. El efectivo actuó con saña contra el muchacho"", dijo el experto en materia de derechos de niños y adolescentes.<br/><br/><b>Por su parte, la investigadora Carla Villamedina indicó que en promedio se registran 76 muertes al mes de menores de edad en el país, un aproximado de dos asesinatos por día. </b><br/><br/>La mayoría de las muertes violentas se producen en medio de discusiones, en enfrentamientos a mano armada sostenidos con otros grupos de jóvenes o policías, por resistencia al robo y en un menor grado en el aula de clases. <br/><br/>También hay muchachos que fallecieron al quedar atrapados en la línea de fuego en tiroteos suscitados entre bandas rivales de una zona. <br/><br/><b>El estado Anzoátegui es el que reporta el mayor número de decesos violentos de jóvenes al contabilizar el año pasado 411.

<p><b>TO THE
REPORT OF NATALIA MATAMOROS, published in the newspaper El Universal that 13%
of the murders were executed by the police.</b></p>
<p>Thursday
February 26, 2015 12:00 AM</p>
<p>""The
murder of a 14 year old student in Tachira in the hands of an official of the
Bolivarian National Police during a demonstration in addition to shock public
opinion, according to executives Cecodap, puts into question the proportionate
use of police force by the use of lethal weapons in street protests.</p>
<p>According
to a statistical report that handles such organization of 912 children and
adolescents murdered in the country last year, 126 homicides were committed by
police and military personnel, which represents 13.8% of all murders reported.</p>
<p>80% of the
killings were the result of effective police confrontations, while the
remaining 20% ​​responded to executions.</p>
<p>Fernando
Pereira, general coordinator of that organization, said that the number of
cases of deaths of young people from this cause experienced a 55.5% increase,
compared to 2013 when there were only 70. Data obtained from an investigation
that involved hemerographic consulting 43 printed media, both national and
regional newspapers.</p>
<p>“We have an
urge for a review of the decision of the Ministry of Defense on the use of
lethal weapons in demonstrations. Security officials should use dialogue to
resolve conflicts. What happened in San Cristobal to the 14 year old student
was abuse of power. The officer acted viciously against the boy, ""said the
expert on the rights of children and adolescents.</p>
<p>Theresearcher
Carla Villamedinasays thatthere isan average of 76 deaths a month of minors in
the country, an estimated two murders per day.</p>
<p>The
majority of violent deaths occur in the middle of discussions, held at gunpoint
confrontations with other youth groups or police, resistance to theft and a
less amount in the classroom.</p>
<p>There are
also boys who died when they were trapped in the line of fire in gunfights
between rival gangs of different zones.</p>
<p>Anzoategui
state is reporting the highest number of violent deaths of young people the
last year 411 followed by Miranda who scored 377 and Carabobo 295.The 89% of
the victims of these crimes are boys aged between 13 and 17 years.</p>
<p>Pereira called
out for the need of a national plan of protection for children under 18.</p>
<p>In addition
to strengthening the disarmament of the population and the implementation of
care programs for victims and their families, as well as the aggressors.</p>
<p>He also
spoke to train police officers on the treatment that must be given to young
people ""</p></strong></div>
<div><b>¿QUE HACER? ¿CÓMO ORGANIZARNOS PARA CONSTRUIR LA PAZ?</b></div>
<div>Ante la gravedad de la situación planteada -tal como lo expresa la madre y estudiante venezolana en el vídeo - la indiferencia y apatía de una inmensa mayoría de los venezolanos, ante el temor de ser reprimidos de manera directa o indirecta como por ejemplo ser despedidos de un empleo público, las madres, abuelas y jóvenes que practicamos Yoga, nos organizamos para apoyar a los Estudiantes y jóvenes en defensa de los Derechos Humanos, mediante campañas a través de las Redes Sociales, pero además nos organizamos en un plataforma digital, para llevar la práctica de Yoga a las comunidades  en todos rincones de Venezuela mediante asociaciones estratégicas, con todos los instructores, profesores, maestros de Yoga, escuelas, promoviendo cualquier tipo de evento, como Talleres, Encuentros, Retiros, Conferencias y recientemente participamos en el Día Internacional del Yoga.</div>
<div>
<p><b>WHAT TO DO?
HOW TO ORGANIZE TO BUILD PEACE?</b></p>
<p>Given the
seriousness of the situation -such as expressed by the mother and Venezuelan
student in the video - the indifference and apathy of the vast majority of
Venezuelans, for fear of being repressed directly or indirectly such as being
laid off public employment, mothers, grandmothers and young people who practice
Yoga, we organize to support students and young people in defense of Human
Rights, through campaigns through social networks, but also we organize on a
digital platform to bring Yoga practice communities in all corners of Venezuela
through strategic partnerships with all instructors, teachers, Yoga teachers,
schools, promoting all kinds of events, including workshops, meetings,
retreats, conferences and recently participated in the International Day Yoga.</p>
</div>
<div><b>¿QUE ES YogaLibre? </b></div>
<div><b>UNA RESPUESTA HECHA EN FORMA DE PROPUESTA A LO EXPRESADO EN NUESTRO VÍDEO ""TU INDIFERENCIA NOS ESTÁ MATANDO""</b></div>
<div>Así ante la indiferencia de la gente, hemos propuesto un Modelo de Organización Comunitaria presencial y Virtual que funciona como una Revista Virtual para la enseñanza y el aprendizaje del Yoga en Venezuela y de la FOTOGRAFÍA, como herramienta para investigación aplicada.</div>
<div>De allí que comenzamos a organizar y apoyar eventos en los lugares más bellos de Venezuela, tanto en la Montaña como en el la costa del Caribe comenzando por nuestro Cerro Ávila, Choriní, Chuao, Uricao, Mérida, Barquisimeto y la Gran Sabana.</div>
<div>En el mes de julio del 2015, nos robaron nuestro equipo de trabajo, cámaras, Memorias, celulares a mi persona y 3 compañeros más en el Cerro el Ávila a la altura de Piedra del Indio, en donde fuimos a realizar una sesión fotográfica  de Acro-Yoga y fue entonces cuando, elaborando IDEAS para avanzar en nuestro proyecto, decidimos contar nuestra historia y presentar nuestro PROYECTO, el cual de Revista Virtual queremos ademas hacer una edición de libros para la enseñanza de yoga con nuestros mejores maestros que nos han apoyado en todas nuestras actividades.</div>
<div>Nuestras campaña va dirigida a todos los venezolanos que viven exiliados en el exterior por razones políticas y económicas, así como a la comunidad de yoguines, yoguinas y activistas por La Paz. </div>

<p><b>WHAT IS
YogaLibre?</b></p>
<p><b>A PROPOSAL
MADE IN THE FORM OF RESPONSE TO WHAT IS EXPRESSED IN OUR VIDEO ""YOUR
INDIFFERENCE IS KILLING US""</b></p>
<p>So to the
indifference of the people, we have proposed a model and virtual community
organization that functions as an online magazine for teaching and learning
Yoga in Venezuela and of photography as a tool for applied research.</p>
<p>From there
we began to organize and support events in the most beautiful places in
Venezuela, both in the mountains and on the Caribbean coast starting from Cerro
Avila, Chorini, Chuao, Uricao, Merida, Barquisimeto and the Gran Sabana.</p>
<p>In July
2015, they stole our teams work equipment, cameras, memories, my and 3 more
other parthners  mobile telephone in the
Cerro Avila atPiedra del Indio, where we went to do a photo session ofAcro
-Yoga and that was when, developing ideas to advance our project, we decided to
tell our story and present our project, which we would like to make as wellas a
Virtual Magazine also  an edition of books
for teaching yoga with our best teachers who have supported us in all our
activities.</p>
<p>Our
campaign is aimed at all Venezuelan exiles living abroad for political and
economic reasons as well as to the community of yogis, yoguinas and peace
activists.</p>
</div>
<div><b>YOGA Y ARTE COMO HERRAMIENTAS PARA CONSTRUIR LA PAZ</b></div>
<div>Para nosotros los venezolanos que resistimos día a día la situación de violencia, escasez de alimentos y medicinas, y pésima prestación de los servicios públicos básicos como transporte, salud y educación y que no podemos viajar al exterior a perfeccionar nuestros conocimientos para mejorar la calidad de la Práctica de Yoga en Venezuela, es necesario, difundir NUESTRO PROYECTO porque a pesar de todas las dificultades, somos capaces de encontrar en el camino del Yoga y el Arte extraordinarias herramientas, para organizar a la gente en función de construir la paz cada día de nuestra existencia, para que nunca más los niños, jóvenes y adolescentes sean asesinados salvajemente.</div>

DE ACUERDO AL REPORTAJE DE NATALIA MATAMOROS, PUBLICADO EN EL DIARIO EL UNIVERSAL EL 13 % DE LOS ASESINATOS FUERON EJECUTADOS POR LAS FUERZAS POLICIALES.
jueves 26 de febrero de 2015 12:00 AM

""El asesinato de un estudiante de 14 años en Táchira a manos de un funcionario de la Policía Nacional Bolivariana durante una manifestación, además de conmocionar a la opinión pública, según directivos de Cecodap, pone en tela de juicio el uso proporcional de la fuerza policial con la utilización de armas letales en protestas callejeras.De acuerdo con un informe estadístico que maneja la referida organización de los 912 niños y adolescentes asesinados en el país durante el año pasado, 126 de los homicidios fueron perpetrados por efectivos policiales y castrenses, lo que representa 13,8% del total de los asesinatos reportados.El 80% de las muertes a manos de efectivos fueron producto enfrentamientos policiales, mientras que el 20% restante respondió a ajusticiamientos. Fernando Pereira, coordinador general de la referida organización, destacó que el número de casos de jóvenes muertos por esta causa experimentó un incremento 55,5%, respecto a 2013 cuando hubo 70. Estos datos se desprenden de una investigación hemerográfica que implicó la consulta de 43 medios impresos, tanto de circulación nacional y regional. ""Urge someter a revisión la resolución del Ministerio de la Defensa sobre el uso de armas mortales en manifestaciones. Los funcionarios de seguridad deberían usar el diálogo para dirimir conflictos. Lo ocurrido en San Cristóbal con el joven de 14 años fue abuso de poder. El efectivo actuó con saña contra el muchacho"", dijo el experto en materia de derechos de niños y adolescentes.Por su parte, la investigadora Carla Villamedina indicó que en promedio se registran 76 muertes al mes de menores de edad en el país, un aproximado de dos asesinatos por día. La mayoría de las muertes violentas se producen en medio de discusiones, en enfrentamientos a mano armada sostenidos con otros grupos de jóvenes o policías, por resistencia al robo y en un menor grado en el aula de clases. También hay muchachos que fallecieron al quedar atrapados en la línea de fuego en tiroteos suscitados entre bandas rivales de una zona. El estado Anzoátegui es el que reporta el mayor número de decesos violentos de jóvenes al contabilizar el año pasado 411. Seguido por Miranda que sumó 377 y Carabobo con 295. El 89% de las víctimas de estos crímenes son varones con edades comprendidas entre 13 y 17 años. Pereira insistió en la necesidad de que se aplique un plan nacional de protección para los menores de 18 años. Además de reforzar el desarme de la población y la puesta en marcha de programas de atención destinados a víctimas y a sus familiares, así como a los agresores. También habló de formar a funcionarios policiales sobre el trato que le deben dar a los jóvenes"" 

TO THE
REPORT OF NATALIA MATAMOROS, published in the newspaper El Universal that 13%
of the murders were executed by the police.
Thursday
February 26, 2015 12:00 AM
""The
murder of a 14 year old student in Tachira in the hands of an official of the
Bolivarian National Police during a demonstration in addition to shock public
opinion, according to executives Cecodap, puts into question the proportionate
use of police force by the use of lethal weapons in street protests.
According
to a statistical report that handles such organization of 912 children and
adolescents murdered in the country last year, 126 homicides were committed by
police and military personnel, which represents 13.8% of all murders reported.
80% of the
killings were the result of effective police confrontations, while the
remaining 20% ​​responded to executions.
Fernando
Pereira, general coordinator of that organization, said that the number of
cases of deaths of young people from this cause experienced a 55.5% increase,
compared to 2013 when there were only 70. Data obtained from an investigation
that involved hemerographic consulting 43 printed media, both national and
regional newspapers.
“We have an
urge for a review of the decision of the Ministry of Defense on the use of
lethal weapons in demonstrations. Security officials should use dialogue to
resolve conflicts. What happened in San Cristobal to the 14 year old student
was abuse of power. The officer acted viciously against the boy, ""said the
expert on the rights of children and adolescents.
Theresearcher
Carla Villamedinasays thatthere isan average of 76 deaths a month of minors in
the country, an estimated two murders per day.
The
majority of violent deaths occur in the middle of discussions, held at gunpoint
confrontations with other youth groups or police, resistance to theft and a
less amount in the classroom.
There are
also boys who died when they were trapped in the line of fire in gunfights
between rival gangs of different zones.
Anzoategui
state is reporting the highest number of violent deaths of young people the
last year 411 followed by Miranda who scored 377 and Carabobo 295.The 89% of
the victims of these crimes are boys aged between 13 and 17 years.
Pereira called
out for the need of a national plan of protection for children under 18.
In addition
to strengthening the disarmament of the population and the implementation of
care programs for victims and their families, as well as the aggressors.
He also
spoke to train police officers on the treatment that must be given to young
people ""
¿QUE HACER? ¿CÓMO ORGANIZARNOS PARA CONSTRUIR LA PAZ?
Ante la gravedad de la situación planteada -tal como lo expresa la madre y estudiante venezolana en el vídeo - la indiferencia y apatía de una inmensa mayoría de los venezolanos, ante el temor de ser reprimidos de manera directa o indirecta como por ejemplo ser despedidos de un empleo público, las madres, abuelas y jóvenes que practicamos Yoga, nos organizamos para apoyar a los Estudiantes y jóvenes en defensa de los Derechos Humanos, mediante campañas a través de las Redes Sociales, pero además nos organizamos en un plataforma digital, para llevar la práctica de Yoga a las comunidades  en todos rincones de Venezuela mediante asociaciones estratégicas, con todos los instructores, profesores, maestros de Yoga, escuelas, promoviendo cualquier tipo de evento, como Talleres, Encuentros, Retiros, Conferencias y recientemente participamos en el Día Internacional del Yoga.

WHAT TO DO?
HOW TO ORGANIZE TO BUILD PEACE?
Given the
seriousness of the situation -such as expressed by the mother and Venezuelan
student in the video - the indifference and apathy of the vast majority of
Venezuelans, for fear of being repressed directly or indirectly such as being
laid off public employment, mothers, grandmothers and young people who practice
Yoga, we organize to support students and young people in defense of Human
Rights, through campaigns through social networks, but also we organize on a
digital platform to bring Yoga practice communities in all corners of Venezuela
through strategic partnerships with all instructors, teachers, Yoga teachers,
schools, promoting all kinds of events, including workshops, meetings,
retreats, conferences and recently participated in the International Day Yoga.

¿QUE ES YogaLibre? 
UNA RESPUESTA HECHA EN FORMA DE PROPUESTA A LO EXPRESADO EN NUESTRO VÍDEO ""TU INDIFERENCIA NOS ESTÁ MATANDO""
Así ante la indiferencia de la gente, hemos propuesto un Modelo de Organización Comunitaria presencial y Virtual que funciona como una Revista Virtual para la enseñanza y el aprendizaje del Yoga en Venezuela y de la FOTOGRAFÍA, como herramienta para investigación aplicada.
De allí que comenzamos a organizar y apoyar eventos en los lugares más bellos de Venezuela, tanto en la Montaña como en el la costa del Caribe comenzando por nuestro Cerro Ávila, Choriní, Chuao, Uricao, Mérida, Barquisimeto y la Gran Sabana.
En el mes de julio del 2015, nos robaron nuestro equipo de trabajo, cámaras, Memorias, celulares a mi persona y 3 compañeros más en el Cerro el Ávila a la altura de Piedra del Indio, en donde fuimos a realizar una sesión fotográfica  de Acro-Yoga y fue entonces cuando, elaborando IDEAS para avanzar en nuestro proyecto, decidimos contar nuestra historia y presentar nuestro PROYECTO, el cual de Revista Virtual queremos ademas hacer una edición de libros para la enseñanza de yoga con nuestros mejores maestros que nos han apoyado en todas nuestras actividades.
Nuestras campaña va dirigida a todos los venezolanos que viven exiliados en el exterior por razones políticas y económicas, así como a la comunidad de yoguines, yoguinas y activistas por La Paz. 

WHAT IS
YogaLibre?
A PROPOSAL
MADE IN THE FORM OF RESPONSE TO WHAT IS EXPRESSED IN OUR VIDEO ""YOUR
INDIFFERENCE IS KILLING US""
So to the
indifference of the people, we have proposed a model and virtual community
organization that functions as an online magazine for teaching and learning
Yoga in Venezuela and of photography as a tool for applied research.
From there
we began to organize and support events in the most beautiful places in
Venezuela, both in the mountains and on the Caribbean coast starting from Cerro
Avila, Chorini, Chuao, Uricao, Merida, Barquisimeto and the Gran Sabana.
In July
2015, they stole our teams work equipment, cameras, memories, my and 3 more
other parthners  mobile telephone in the
Cerro Avila atPiedra del Indio, where we went to do a photo session ofAcro
-Yoga and that was when, developing ideas to advance our project, we decided to
tell our story and present our project, which we would like to make as wellas a
Virtual Magazine also  an edition of books
for teaching yoga with our best teachers who have supported us in all our
activities.
Our
campaign is aimed at all Venezuelan exiles living abroad for political and
economic reasons as well as to the community of yogis, yoguinas and peace
activists.

YOGA Y ARTE COMO HERRAMIENTAS PARA CONSTRUIR LA PAZ
Para nosotros los venezolanos que resistimos día a día la situación de violencia, escasez de alimentos y medicinas, y pésima prestación de los servicios públicos básicos como transporte, salud y educación y que no podemos viajar al exterior a perfeccionar nuestros conocimientos para mejorar la calidad de la Práctica de Yoga en Venezuela, es necesario, difundir NUESTRO PROYECTO porque a pesar de todas las dificultades, somos capaces de encontrar en el camino del Yoga y el Arte extraordinarias herramientas, para organizar a la gente en función de construir la paz cada día de nuestra existencia, para que nunca más los niños, jóvenes y adolescentes sean asesinados salvajemente.

YOGA AND ART AS A TOOL TO BUILD PEACE
For us Venezuelans that have to resist every day the violence, shortages of food and medicine, and terrible public services such as transport, health and education and can not travel abroad to improve our knowledge and quality of Yoga practice in Venezuela, it is necessary to spread our project because despite all the difficulties, we are able to find in the way of Yoga and Artextraordinary tools to organize people in order to build peace every day of our existence, so never again  children, youth and adolescents are savagely murdered.

After my contract ended there at the end of June, I received 2 other offers to work in the same area - online massmedia. But I stood up to my decision of no longer working in this field and kindly refused those offers - because I sincerely feel that I should give my whole energy, time and soul to becoming a good teacher and increase awarness for a healthy way of living, starting with the little ones.

</ul><h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3><p>We envision a future in which our alumni and greater community remain deeply connected to each other and committed to our mission, vision, and values for the rest of their lives. </p><p>As our community members becomes leaders in their workplaces and communities, internationally, they will inspire others to join their pursuit towards peace, encouraging collaboration and innovation, and thereby building sustainable peace and prosperity for generations to come.</p><p>We will accomplish this through caring, encouraging facilitators who develop flexible, integrated curriculums.  These, in turn, create opportunities for investigation, critical thought, discovery, problem solving, and self-expression. </p><p><i>Our unified effort between school, student, family, and community is to prepare the next generation to challenge themselves in the pursuit of new knowledge, personal growth, and social contribution.</i></p><h3>Our Values</h3><p>With greater ownership of the education process, students more readily understand and adhere to concepts like respect, honesty, efficiency, and personal growth. Over time they can learn to confidently make good decisions in all areas of their lives as opposed to being afraid of making bad ones.  Detailed below are the five characteristics that PACR strives to nurture and inspire in each of our students: </p><p><strong>Divergent Thinker</strong> – There are often multiple solutions to the same problem.  Studies show expert potential in this regard in young children, which declines over time as they are processed through schools with standardized curriculums.  This trait is paramount to a generation of new and unique ideas which serve as inspiration to others; the effect is cyclical and enormously beneficial to human creativity and innovation.   <br/><br/><strong>Conscious Consumer</strong> – Every product and service we purchase has a “footprint” which is the sum of all the energy, resources and waste required to provide it, to use it and to dispose of it.  Making intelligent decisions here is a responsibility we all share on a global level, and another way we can look beyond our self-interest and live in a manner that best serves the health and quality of life for all living things.  <br/><br/><strong>Self-Educator </strong>– An effective school is one that can instill in kids a love for the learning process.  Children are then equipped and inspired to pursue new knowledge and greater challenges long after their formalized schooling has ended.  Both failures and successes are further motivation, for the broader perspective of the world they bring along with deep, internal reward.</p><p><strong>Collaborator</strong> – Competition breeds distrust, greed, secrecy, and conflict which inhibits real scientific and human progress.  When collaboration becomes the central principle in our social order, our most critical problems will get solved.  Global collaboration will put mankind on course to achieve its highest potential - for individual growth and human progress – and the opportunity to finally become “civilized”.   <br/><br/><strong>Change Agent</strong> – Change agents are the valued problem solvers of the world, always asking: “is there a better way?” An effective educational experience will push students to look beyond conformity and seek out solutions to the most  challenging human problems as those represent the greatest reward – not monetary gain or personal status, but reward in the form of discovery and human benefit.</p><h3>Our Model</h3><p>Our model uses a four-pronged approach to instilling the values above, through careful program design that focuses on inquiry-based learning, community service, peace studies, and leadership programs:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning</strong><br/>We must be curious about others, learn to listen, and sharpen our minds through disciplined inquiry. Inquiry takes the form of research, assessments of programs and activities, field trips, and intense discussions about world conflict and resolution.  This leads to a more fundamental understanding of the root of social issues and the formation of real solutions.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Community Service</strong><br/>Service work shifts our focus from the self to others. Volunteerism is a dynamic, two-way process between two equal partners.  All students must complete the annual mandated service hours, and are encouraged to reach Internship Excellence.  Service projects have included community clean-up, job shadowing, teaching, supporting local businesses, working with children, and lifeguarding.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Peace and Diversity Curriculum</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our students engage in peace studies and our academy is continually developing new curriculum relevant to world issues and student interests.  In elementary and middle school, peace studies, and the values related to peace ambassadorship, are incorporated into most subject areas as they naturally relate to the world.  At the secondary school level, all graduates must earn two or more Peace and Diversity credits, that require them to explore their own place in our global society and the strategies we can use to create change.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Leadership Programs</strong><br/>Our programs are structured so that participants take ownership of the design and implementation of program activities, as well as develop the confidence to be the gracious leaders we encourage them to be.  Our youth have developed leadership skills through programs we have designed or by participating in community programs that we support.  These include lifeguarding, public speaking, team-building, theatre, and awareness projects/campaigns.</p><h3>How to Join Our Movement</h3><ul>

Sophisticated Leadership and Peace Education Programs ($10,000)With your help we will be able to offer more programs, to even more youth! This is part of our journey to equip our students with the tools needed to develop skills and spread optimism about creating a peaceful world.  This means inserting more programs including ongoing workshops, teacher training, field trips, guest speakers, non-violent conflict resolution, and confidence building programs.2. Scholarships for Peace Ambassadorship and Leadership ($24,000)We are fully committed to our vision and peace ambassadorship, and want to attract like-minded, innovative, and driven youth who have caught the vision along with us.  With criteria that includes leadership skills, superior personal resolve, and a dream to pursue a lifelong journey that pushes the boundaries of traditional education, we will select students who embrace the possibility to create personal and regional change.Potential students will engage in a meaningful application process, and can join us locally or internationally, gaining a rigorous North American diploma that is recognized worldwide.  By showing evidence of leadership promise through community projects and/or exceptional devotion to their personal pursuits, we will attract students and families who will put our teachings into practise, both immediately and lifelong.3. Tools and Technology ($10,000)We will acquire some of the tools and technology needed for the students to allow them to plan and create community outreach projects, student created documentaries and multimedia projects. 4.  The remainder of funds will go towards covering the cost of the campaign including promotion, and Indiegogo fees.  Our long-term goal is to have a Purpose-Built School With a Design Led by Our Mission Conscious, Sustainable, and Peaceful LivingTaking our inspiration from other schools, organizations, and current design research, we will build a school that follows Costa Rica’s lead to become carbon neutral and self-sustaining.  With careful and conscious design, we will collaborate with both international experts and local knowledge to complete this project, drawing on the expertise, talent, and will of those who want to join our movement.Our students dream of a mix of modern learning spaces and outdoor natural classrooms, increasing our ability to apply learning to the real world.  They envision a garden, a green kitchen, an indoor/outdoor science lab, safe spaces for physical activity, and areas that encourage both whole group activities and peaceful solitude.  Our teachers dream of a school that welcomes both thoughtful collaboration and strong individual focus, inspires their own creativity, and surrounds us with the natural beauty that teaches us better than anything else how precious our earth is.  Inspiration for UnityWe want all who enter the grounds and facility of Peace Academy to be immediately immersed in our mission, with evidence of the inspiration and accomplishments of our current young leaders, our forerunners, and historical figures, with powerful messages that remind us of the journey we are committed to.We will incorporate the making of a gathering spot in our school design – a place that claims our attention and commands our respect.  It will be a labyrinth of all those things that encourage unity and an entanglement of ideas borne out of our will to encourage peace. In following that, it is important to PACR to design a gathering place that encourages cooperation and innovative peace practices.  This congregative area will increase our ability to provide unique programs for our students, families, and community members.  It will also serve as a unique gathering space for other organizations and groups whose work aligns well with ours.Opportunities for Community ContributionA key component of our model includes service to others.

Volunteerism is a dynamic, two-way process between two equal partners.  All students must complete the annual mandated service hours, and are encouraged to reach Internship Excellence.  Service projects have included community clean-up, job shadowing, teaching, supporting local businesses, working with children, and lifeguarding.Peace and Diversity CurriculumOur students engage in peace studies and our academy is continually developing new curriculum relevant to world issues and student interests.  In elementary and middle school, peace studies, and the values related to peace ambassadorship, are incorporated into most subject areas as they naturally relate to the world.  At the secondary school level, all graduates must earn two or more Peace and Diversity credits, that require them to explore their own place in our global society and the strategies we can use to create change.Leadership ProgramsOur programs are structured so that participants take ownership of the design and implementation of program activities, as well as develop the confidence to be the gracious leaders we encourage them to be.  Our youth have developed leadership skills through programs we have designed or by participating in community programs that we support.  These include lifeguarding, public speaking, team-building, theatre, and awareness projects/campaigns.How to Join Our Movement

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My educational journey began in my early 20's. In the midst of that journey, I became pregnant with twins and decided to postpone my journey to raise my children. Once they had reached a certain age and were in child care, I decided to return to school and scheduled an education plan meeting with a college counselor. Upon meeting with the counselor, one of the challenges that stood out during my meeting was that they were having a difficult time trying to figure out what classes I took at my previous school that aligned with the classes I needed to take at their school in order to achieve my goals.  After almost an<strong> </strong>hour of searching through possible class options, going back and forth between both colleges class descriptions, making phone calls, searching through documents and transcripts, to try to peace everything together,  we eventually came to a resolution that worked for my individual circumstance. I was able to complete a full semester before I had to take another break because over time, handling all of those responsibilities was too much for me as a single parent of two amazing children.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2018. My twins were now starting high school and I could allow myself the time to focus on me and be a role model to them by finishing what I started years ago. Naturally one would think that after 10 years there would have to have been some advances in technology and better programs for education for people like me, unfortunately this was not the case. The same challenges I ran into 10 years prior were the same challenges I was running into now, 10 years later. That's when I said there has to be a better way. Shortly thereafter I went to work on what I felt could benefit students, past, present and future. and I came up with the idea for my 2 A Degree App,,. <i>because everyone should have the same equal access to education.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am no stranger to fundraising. As the President of a Nonprofit 501 c3 organization for several years, I raised the funds to fund the field trips and supplies for an entire Pre K to 6 grade elementary school, and that was no easy task.</p>
<p>The App is in it's early developmental phase and I am a resilient person who likes to be proactive, so I'm getting an early start and hitting the ground running. I need to raise an additional 40K to fund the functionality and cost for development portion of the App. Not only will the app  make it simple and easy to track your progress, it will work for anyone, whether you are starting, continuing or completing your path to higher learning. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Navigating through information to take college courses should not be more challenging than the classes you will have to take. Now, the key to your success is in your hand and it's an app on your phone.</p>
<p>This has the potential to be much more than just an app. My goal is to make this a program that is used in every high school and college all over the world. </p>
<p>This app will be life changing, as we all know, life can get in the way sometimes so imagine being able to go back to school to finish out that degree you had to put off. It would also be beneficial to new students who are entering into the college level, by providing an easier and more fun way to follow their individual educational plan process, with much less confusion. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any venture there will always be unforeseeable challenges. I have surrounded myself with a team of people that include but are not limited to, educators, accountants, marketing strategist, and content developers, to name a few. in addition to using my resources, for any issues that may arise, know that I think quick on my feet and am confident in my ability to get them resolved with little to no issues. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge that I foresee is reaching the amount needed to complete the app. However, I am not worried because as an accomplished fund raiser, I know what it takes to successfully raise funds by continuing to have as many fundraising campaign as needed to reach the goal, in addition to other things outside of the campaigns such as sales and using the proceeds from my small business.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>With the understanding that we are facing a life changing pandemic and that not everyone is in the position to contribute financially that is perfectly okay, but keep in mind that every little bit helps and there is no such thing as too little. One of the things that people will tell you about me is that I am one of their biggest supporters. If I don't have the money I will either share the information about their business via social media and word of mouth, send recommendations to others looking for their type of services, share my resources and even reach out to my extensive network of people that I am connected to through clubs, Boards and Communities I am involved in. So, if you are not in a position to make a monitory contribution, maybe you know someone who can, maybe you believe enough in the mission to share my vision with your collogues, whichever way you choose to contribute, every little bit helps, you never know how something has simple as sharing an idea can have a big impact on the success of 2 A Degree. In the meantime,  I will be praying that your situation improves so that you can be in a better place financially and thank you in advance for any support you give, It is very much appreciated. </p>

<h3>About the Author | Jim Flannery</h3>
<p>I struggle with talking about myself without doing comedy, so I'm going to use the same bio I just submitted for a conference in Ottawa, where my role was to discuss self-directed education and its role in building child-friendly communities.<br/><br/><i>&gt;&gt;&gt; BEGIN COPY/PASTE &gt;&gt;&gt;</i></p>
<p>Jim attended public school in the United States in a suburb in Connecticut.  He got top grades that allowed him to go on to obtain a biomedical engineering degree from a top University where he graduated <i>magna cum laude</i>.  By all conventional metrics, 22-year old Jim appeared to be the poster child for a successful public education system.</p>
<p>As a surprising twist, at 27 years of age, Jim left the tech startup world and took a job as a physics teacher at a public high school.  Within a year, Jim left teaching high school to create an alternative to the conventional school system. </p>
<p>Why the change of heart?</p>
<p>Find out in this exciting discussion, where Jim hosts a group of teens from the <a href=""https://peerunschooling.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peer Unschooling Network</a> (PUN) to discuss the amplification of youth voice in the public education system.</p>
<p>If you want to prepare for the session, please read <a href=""https://www.youthrights.org/blog/the-academia-manifesto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Academia Manifesto</a>.  This landmark document, featured on the <a href=""https://www.youthrights.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Youth Rights Association</a> (NYRA) website, was drafted by <a href=""http://peerunschooling.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PUN </a>members Katherine Farr &amp; Walker Meyn as part of NYRA’s <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2020-nyra-virtual-conference-age-of-youth-tickets-113207552838"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Age of Youth campaign</a>.</p>
<p>[<a href=""http://www.ucyottawa.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LEARN MORE ABOUT THE Uniting for Children and Youth CONFERENCE</a>]<br/><br/><i>&gt;&gt;&gt; END COPY/PASTE &gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<br/><strong>About the Book | LEAVE SCHOOL</strong>
</h2>
<p>Some of you reading this may know I released an app called <a href=""http://leave-school.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>LEAVE SCHOOL: what teachers can't tell you</strong>,</a> that helps young people who are frustrated by school to lead fulfilling lives without it.<br/><br/>Well, now I am publishing <u>LEAVE SCHOOL</u> as a physical book!  So, go crush those trees and grind 'em up papa bear, Jimbo's ego's larger than life itself!</p>
<p>All jokes aside, I was honestly expecting the LEAVE SCHOOL app to be sufficient... hence why I went straight to making the app rather than creating a printed.  But I realize now that an audio-only product limits these ideas about self-directed education only to people who can hear - and <a href=""https://jim-flannery.com/making-self-directed-education-accessible-to-all/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">self-directed education should be accessible to EVERYONE</a>!<br/> </p>
<p>So, like I said, it's time to crush them trees and grind 'em up to drip some ink on 'em! (#plucktrees!)</p>
<p>I'm using IndieGoGo to promote the ""<strong>ZEROth Edition</strong>"" of LEAVE SCHOOL, which is the exact same version of LEAVE SCHOOL that I sent to the copy editor last week.  Once the copy editor has it, they'll move forward with the process of getting it ""perfect"", finding a literary agent, negotiating with a publisher, planning a promotional thing, and eventually something something. </p>
<p>That means this version, the <strong>ZEROth edition</strong>, is 100% my words.  For those of you who've already listened to the LEAVE SCHOOL mobile app, you'll notice this print version is essentially a manuscript for the app (plus some notes to the copy editor in the margins), so please don't be disappointed!</p>
<p>After the book goes to a 'real publisher', I won't be able to sell any more<strong> ZEROth edition</strong> copies of the book - <i><u><strong>EVER</strong></u></i>.  After this, you'll only be able to get LEAVE SCHOOL by purchasing a copy from an actual publisher and, honestly, who knows what they're going to do with my words. </p>
<p>P.S. And hey - wouldn't it be better for <i><u><strong>ME</strong></u><strong> </strong></i>to get all the money and not the publisher?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>It costs me about $25 to print one each copy of LEAVE SCHOOL (nice shiny covers included!).  To cover shipping and packaging, I'm adding another $25.  It's a flat rate, so you so don't have to worry about calculating it or being surprised by any fees.  (US <i>and</i> International!!!).  I'm selling LEAVE SCHOOL for $50, which feels fair all things considered in the process (and the value the reader will get!).</li>
<li>If there are any profits from this campaign, I'll likely dump them into more SnapChat ads to promote the LEAVE SCHOOL app and to organize a book/comedy tour for 2021 to promote the printed book.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of LEAVE SCHOOL</h3>
<p>If I'm honest about the impact I imagine LEAVE SCHOOL book making, people will lock me up for having delusions of grandeur. </p>
<p>So let's just say this: I'd like to take the impact the LEAVE SCHOOL <i>app</i> is already having (see reviews below) and dump as much fertilizer as the trees we're going to kill to print this book can handle, and grow that impact through the LEAVE SCHOOL (<a href=""https://youtu.be/El3GYeaXoSw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">share lnik</a>) book. </p>
<p>Not to worry, there is no poetry in the LEAVE SCHOOL book (you can check the app to verify).</p>
<p>As far as that big question of ""how many copies of LEAVE SCHOOL do I want to sell?"" - I'm not sure...  but it'd be cool if I sold so many that we had to resort to chopping down trees in the Amazon rain forest to print all the copies... I'm really curious what's under there!!!!</p>
<p>For the record, I did tell the copy editor my goal is 50 books by New Years... which would make sure they still have a job ;)<br/> </p>
<p><i><strong>REVIEWS:</strong></i></p>

I struggle with talking about myself without doing comedy, so I'm going to use the same bio I just submitted for a conference in Ottawa, where my role was to discuss self-directed education and its role in building child-friendly communities.>>> BEGIN COPY/PASTE >>>
Jim attended public school in the United States in a suburb in Connecticut.  He got top grades that allowed him to go on to obtain a biomedical engineering degree from a top University where he graduated magna cum laude.  By all conventional metrics, 22-year old Jim appeared to be the poster child for a successful public education system.
As a surprising twist, at 27 years of age, Jim left the tech startup world and took a job as a physics teacher at a public high school.  Within a year, Jim left teaching high school to create an alternative to the conventional school system. 
Why the change of heart?
Find out in this exciting discussion, where Jim hosts a group of teens from the Peer Unschooling Network (PUN) to discuss the amplification of youth voice in the public education system.
If you want to prepare for the session, please read The Academia Manifesto.  This landmark document, featured on the National Youth Rights Association (NYRA) website, was drafted by PUN members Katherine Farr & Walker Meyn as part of NYRA’s Age of Youth campaign.

About the Book | LEAVE SCHOOL

Some of you reading this may know I released an app called LEAVE SCHOOL: what teachers can't tell you, that helps young people who are frustrated by school to lead fulfilling lives without it.Well, now I am publishing LEAVE SCHOOL as a physical book!  So, go crush those trees and grind 'em up papa bear, Jimbo's ego's larger than life itself!
All jokes aside, I was honestly expecting the LEAVE SCHOOL app to be sufficient... hence why I went straight to making the app rather than creating a printed.  But I realize now that an audio-only product limits these ideas about self-directed education only to people who can hear - and self-directed education should be accessible to EVERYONE! 
So, like I said, it's time to crush them trees and grind 'em up to drip some ink on 'em! (#plucktrees!)
I'm using IndieGoGo to promote the ""ZEROth Edition"" of LEAVE SCHOOL, which is the exact same version of LEAVE SCHOOL that I sent to the copy editor last week.  Once the copy editor has it, they'll move forward with the process of getting it ""perfect"", finding a literary agent, negotiating with a publisher, planning a promotional thing, and eventually something something. 
That means this version, the ZEROth edition, is 100% my words.  For those of you who've already listened to the LEAVE SCHOOL mobile app, you'll notice this print version is essentially a manuscript for the app (plus some notes to the copy editor in the margins), so please don't be disappointed!
After the book goes to a 'real publisher', I won't be able to sell any more ZEROth edition copies of the book - EVER.  After this, you'll only be able to get LEAVE SCHOOL by purchasing a copy from an actual publisher and, honestly, who knows what they're going to do with my words. 
P.S. And hey - wouldn't it be better for ME to get all the money and not the publisher?
 

What I Need & What You Get

It costs me about $25 to print one each copy of LEAVE SCHOOL (nice shiny covers included!).  To cover shipping and packaging, I'm adding another $25.  It's a flat rate, so you so don't have to worry about calculating it or being surprised by any fees.  (US and International!!!).  I'm selling LEAVE SCHOOL for $50, which feels fair all things considered in the process (and the value the reader will get!).
If there are any profits from this campaign, I'll likely dump them into more SnapChat ads to promote the LEAVE SCHOOL app and to organize a book/comedy tour for 2021 to promote the printed book. 


The Impact of LEAVE SCHOOL
If I'm honest about the impact I imagine LEAVE SCHOOL book making, people will lock me up for having delusions of grandeur. 
So let's just say this: I'd like to take the impact the LEAVE SCHOOL app is already having (see reviews below) and dump as much fertilizer as the trees we're going to kill to print this book can handle, and grow that impact through the LEAVE SCHOOL (share lnik) book. 
Not to worry, there is no poetry in the LEAVE SCHOOL book (you can check the app to verify).
As far as that big question of ""how many copies of LEAVE SCHOOL do I want to sell?"" - I'm not sure...  but it'd be cool if I sold so many that we had to resort to chopping down trees in the Amazon rain forest to print all the copies... I'm really curious what's under there!!!!
For the record, I did tell the copy editor my goal is 50 books by New Years... which would make sure they still have a job ;)

We use stories to make learning super fun and super playful, and we need your help to make it happen!   The EdBoard was created with one goal in mind: helping the next generation of engineers find their confidence. Using a combination of story-based learning and large, magnetic components designed for children, the EdBoard represents the cutting edge of at-home STEM learning. Created by a passionate group of educators and engineers, our story-based curriculum is designed using the latest in child developmental research. Our approach has been validated by academic research from the University of Colorado Boulder, which showed that the EdBoard limited frustration while helping develop a stronger understanding of circuitry.EdBoard sparks kids' imaginations by introducing them to the lovable town of Sparkdale. Though a great place to live, the EdBugs who live there need help solving the circuit mysteries and puzzles that are troubling the town. Lizzy the Lightning Bug and her friends will guide young learners through the real-world engineering process of ‘debugging’, designing, and building circuits as they work together to untangle the secrets of Sparkdale. We plan to develop and release expansion kits that can be purchased individually or through our subscription service.   Every kit comes with lesson plans that are carefully crafted to work for children in any learning environment. For educators, we will have free access to additional online guides and lesson plans. At home, new expansion kits ensure new concepts to explore. Your EdBoard will never collect dust on the shelf!Welcome to the town of Sparkdale, where all the learning takes place! As the newest city engineer of Sparkdale, you and your child will work hand-in-hand with Lizzy the Lightning Bug, using real-world engineering to solve the technical puzzles that have been befuddling the lovable EdBugs. Critters all over the city are wiggling with anticipation to meet their newest engineer! Explore Sparkdale through our circuit stories. Go on an adventure with the EdBugs as they introduce your child to all the awesome applications of circuitry.  Work through Circuit Stories to help the EdBugs of Sparkdale! As you read through your story, you will encounter and discover the befuddling problems facing the EdBugs. Then, by building circuits on your EdBoard, you will engineer solutions to help the town!Expand Sparkdale and meet new friends in our future expansion kits! Keep an eye out for our upcoming subscription service, which is the easiest way to stay up to date on all the most recent Sparkdale adventures!The EdBoard is designed so that you don't need any previous circuitry experience to work with your kid. Any parent can easily use the EdBoard! In our first three kits, your child will learn about...   There's a lot more than circuitry that children need to succeed in STEM. That's why we use our kits to teach about more than just circuitry. EdBoards help prepare children to succeed in a variety of different academic subjects.This is only the beginning of Sparkdale and more importantly your child's journey towards becoming an engineer and inventor. Here are just a few examples of the next three year's worth of Circuit Stories we have planned out.   Work with Lizzie the Lightning Bug to learn the first steps in circuitry. Here you will learn about the basics of electrical flow and the foundations of circuitry. Help the lightning bug engineers install a traffic light in time for Sparkdale’s Festival of Colors!

I'm a grade 11 student at Waterdown District High School and I need your help. I'm raising funds to make my teacher's history museum the best museum that's ever been in a high school! The idea for this campaign came about when Mr. Flosman assigned my Genocide class (for learning about Genocide not learning how to do it) our culminating task: The Hope Project. This project has students strive to make Canada a better place and Canadians more tolerant by understanding their History.</p><p>I decided that for my project I would create this Indiegogo campaign for Mr. Flosman's museum to provide an exceptional learning experience for students. This is the main goal of the museum and this campaign. But a personal goal for me is to help my teacher, who has helped countless others in the school community for no reason other than to help. And I believe it's time to give back.</p><p><b>The Museum</b></p><p>In 2013, Mr. Flosman created the Waterdown Museum of History to give his students a new way to learn about their history.

<p><b>The Dream</b></p>
<p>Mr. Flosman's idea for the museum is pretty ambitious. 2016 is the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme and to commemorate that, Mr. Flosman came up with the idea to build a life-sized trench using actual materials that were used like plywood and sandbags. This would provide an interactive experience for students all across the Flamborough-Waterdown area.</p>
<p>This isn't the only thing he'll do with this set however. Another part of Mr. Flosman's plan is create a new interactive exhibit every year for his museum. Next year is the anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge.</p>
<p><b>Bringing the Dream to Reality</b></p>
<p>To cover the costs of the trench we need about $2000 dollars. This will allow us to buy materials to make the trench as accurate as possible.</p>
<p><b>InDemand</b></p>
<p>After our campaign ends, it will convert to an InDemand project. This means that we can still collect money after the end of the campaign! This is a great opportunity to further improve the museum with the help of our generous supporters. At the end of 2016, we will opt out of InDemand and that will mark the definite end to the campaign.</p>

I'm a grade 11 student at Waterdown District High School and I need your help. I'm raising funds to make my teacher's history museum the best museum that's ever been in a high school! The idea for this campaign came about when Mr. Flosman assigned my Genocide class (for learning about Genocide not learning how to do it) our culminating task: The Hope Project. This project has students strive to make Canada a better place and Canadians more tolerant by understanding their History.I decided that for my project I would create this Indiegogo campaign for Mr. Flosman's museum to provide an exceptional learning experience for students. This is the main goal of the museum and this campaign. But a personal goal for me is to help my teacher, who has helped countless others in the school community for no reason other than to help. And I believe it's time to give back.The MuseumIn 2013, Mr. Flosman created the Waterdown Museum of History to give his students a new way to learn about their history. We've got a plethora of artifacts and items from all throughout history.Display CasesMilitary SwordsSA DaggerA Real Jewish Star

This isn't the only thing he'll do with this set however. Another part of Mr. Flosman's plan is create a new interactive exhibit every year for his museum. Next year is the anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge.

Right From Start programme, which helped to refurbish 8 basic schools; and the
provision of educational grants and assistance for sporting programmes. The

<p>With your help, I know we can realise the

misguided leadership that lacks the  vision and political will to do the

I am convinced it is time for more of us who are willing to put our country
first to step forward. Our people deserve competent, honest, and committed

</div></div>","learningbros is a community of people who
love to discover new things and share their knowledge. The bromunity started
with the idea that the most efficient way to learn anything is by making it
easily accessible. We’re committed to make your life easier: learn or teach
what you want, where you want, with whom you want!During the
slavering period, ""each one teach one"" was an African proverb when slaves didn’t
have access to any education. As soon as one slave learned to read or to write,
he had the mission to teach someone else.
Learningbros started
with the idea thatWe think that anyone owns a knowledge or a passion, whatever it is. This passion can be shared and monetized.Courses or lessons you can find so far aren’t flexible and customised.
Learningbros targets to create interaction between individuals, allows them to
choose courses and professors at times and prices that suit them.More than a simple additional revenue for the teacher, more than only

discover new things and share their knowledge.On

create a listing that you want to teach, you become a Bro-teacher ready to be
contacted by Bromail by a Bro. Meet your Bro at your favorite Broffice and at the end of a nice Bro
lesson, leave your Broviews on learningbros.comTo be paid the Bro-teacher enters the Bro-code on the system in learningbros.com and get the paiement on his bank account.



If you want to
expand your skill set or discover a new passion, you can search on
learningbros.com for the perfect
Bro to teach you, contact him, book a lesson, pay online and meet him.

   The Impact 
Camp Yogaville is based on and operated by the teachings of Swami Satchidananda, founder of Integral Yoga® and Yogaville.




Swami Satchidananda teaches ""Truth is One, Paths are Many"" a message that has been bringing people of all walks of life together in understanding and harmony for almost 50 years.

Risks & Challenges
  The Camp Yogaville Scholarship Fund will have it's own account that will only be used for the purpose of bringing children to Camp Yogaville who would otherwise miss out.
The challenge will be who gets a scholarship. Right now there is not an overwhelming number of children that cannot afford Camp Yogaville requesting assistance. By asking parents to pay what they can we hope to stretch this fund as far as is needed in the future.

they don't understand them?</b></p>
<p>Imagine that your life depended on taking a bottle of pills
properly. Now imagine how scary it would be if you were one of the 90 million
people, who, for various reasons, cannot read, understand, or process the
complexity of medical instructions. Now imagine that no one in your family can
either! Medical care miscommunication can lead to crisis and even death. </p>
<p>Patients and their caregivers should be able to receive
their information in way that they can readily understand. That may mean that
the patient needs their medication reminders and other information in Spanish
or another language. It may mean that they need to hear it in English. In the
case of English as a second language, many people learn to speak another language
but they don’t read it well. And there are many others that find printed
instructions very difficult to understand or inaccessible. And yet, the
healthcare establishment continues to give us printed information designed for
14% of population that has high health literacy.</p>

Caregivers are frequently tired and worried
about their patient.  They may work a job
and still have children to manage. SpeechMED Caregiver is a simple to use tool to
empower patients and their caregivers. 
It allows them to upload
a wide range of personalized care information including medications,
reminders, emergency contacts, allergies and appointments. It also allows the
Caretaker to monitor some of the patient’s activities remotely.  In addition instructions can be left in
different language for other caretakers. </div><div>

We are frustrated with traditional healthcare communication
because it is causing families everywhere to have avoidable, life-threatening
and expensive mistakes. 


How
can patients and their caregivers follow critical healthcare instructions when
they don't understand them?
Imagine that your life depended on taking a bottle of pills
properly. Now imagine how scary it would be if you were one of the 90 million
people, who, for various reasons, cannot read, understand, or process the
complexity of medical instructions. Now imagine that no one in your family can
either! Medical care miscommunication can lead to crisis and even death. 
Patients and their caregivers should be able to receive
their information in way that they can readily understand. That may mean that
the patient needs their medication reminders and other information in Spanish
or another language. It may mean that they need to hear it in English. In the
case of English as a second language, many people learn to speak another language
but they don’t read it well. And there are many others that find printed
instructions very difficult to understand or inaccessible. And yet, the
healthcare establishment continues to give us printed information designed for
14% of population that has high health literacy.



We
are here with a solution for a new healthcare communication future! An easy to use
multi-lingual tablet for patients and their caregivers that actually makes
their lives safer and more organized.  With
your help we can bring healthcare information to the rest of us.
