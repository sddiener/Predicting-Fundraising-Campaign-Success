But not before everything would be demolished and ashed away. </p>
<p>We are embarking on a great venture, trying to bring to life some of the Romanian inspired artistic vision of Dadaism.

<p>Projects like this are a niche and they don't live in the main public space of entertainment, they materialise from the community spirit and from genuine love to art making. However, this means that getting enough funds is always an issue. We have been producing this performance from our own savings and volunteering our time, and we are loving it. However, getting financially exhausted can prevent us from moving forward and promoting the performance to other audiences apart from the two representations we are performing at the Romanian Cultural Institute. Refilling our pots after spending on rehearsal times, transport, costumes, props and logistics would give us the chance to promote the performance to a larger audience and to making it available to a broader public who will ultimately connect with Romanian creativity and culture in U.K. </p>
<p>You will be rewarded well for your support, we promise you. Some of our offerings include original dada art poster created by our very own visual artist director with hand crafted signatures from the crew and an exciting dada poetry jam session.</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what you should know about me. I’m a playwright, screenwriter, and librettist. My plays have been staged throughout North America and Europe. I co-wrote the screenplay (based on my play) for the 2004 film <i>The Woodsman</i>. Writing plays is my way to be funny, irreverent, outrageous, political and to stage original stories that will engage the audience to reflect on stories from their own experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW IT BEGAN</strong></p>
<p>Last summer my wife and I took a trip to Norway. As we journeyed I wondered what the Norwegians thought of America now. Like many of you I have been troubled by the direction our country has been going in. And like many of you I asked myself, “How can I respond?” It was during my travels in Norway that I found a way to respond: I wrote my play <i>Bergen</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p><i>Bergen </i>is a dark comedy set in Norway in the near future. We follow a group of quarrelsome rock musicians who vow that if they don’t find a name for their band by the end of the night they will disband. The one criterion is that the name must comment on the collapse of America. While these young Norwegians either loathe or pity America, they are all drawn to its idolized ideals. During the night there is drinking, music, betrayals, erotic fantasies, and an unforeseen event that threatens the band’s survival.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR GOAL</strong></p>
<p>Foremost, I want to stage a compelling production of the play and to generate excitement from audiences and industry people. From this excitement we can move the play to the next stage: a new home, higher production values, a longer run, and to share my story with many more people.   </p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCTION
Here’s what you should know about me. I’m a playwright, screenwriter, and librettist. My plays have been staged throughout North America and Europe. I co-wrote the screenplay (based on my play) for the 2004 film The Woodsman. Writing plays is my way to be funny, irreverent, outrageous, political and to stage original stories that will engage the audience to reflect on stories from their own experiences.
 
HOW IT BEGAN
Last summer my wife and I took a trip to Norway. As we journeyed I wondered what the Norwegians thought of America now. Like many of you I have been troubled by the direction our country has been going in. And like many of you I asked myself, “How can I respond?” It was during my travels in Norway that I found a way to respond: I wrote my play Bergen.
 
THE STORY
Bergen is a dark comedy set in Norway in the near future. We follow a group of quarrelsome rock musicians who vow that if they don’t find a name for their band by the end of the night they will disband. The one criterion is that the name must comment on the collapse of America. While these young Norwegians either loathe or pity America, they are all drawn to its idolized ideals. During the night there is drinking, music, betrayals, erotic fantasies, and an unforeseen event that threatens the band’s survival.
 
WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW
We’re now at that sweet beginning of a production. We have our brilliant director, Kathy Gail MacGowan, and design team. We have our talented cast of young, eager actors. We’re about to begin rehearsals and discover who these characters are. We’re all very excited to begin that process.
 
OUR GOAL
Foremost, I want to stage a compelling production of the play and to generate excitement from audiences and industry people. From this excitement we can move the play to the next stage: a new home, higher production values, a longer run, and to share my story with many more people.   
 
HOW CAN YOU HELP
We need your support to help us meet our budget goal of raising $6,500. You can help us by sending us a suggested donation of $35 (or more) in our Indiegogo campaign. You can help us by spreading the word to your friends and family about our Indiegogo campaign.

<p>Welcome to our campaign and thank you for visiting! ACW Dances is an emerging modern dance company based in Arlington, VA. We're in our second full season, producing our third full-length show this April. In our short life thus far, we've had great reviews, great shows, and even greater supporters. </p>
<p>ACW Dances started as a two-person company, with Artistic Director Abigail Wallace and collaborator Kerry Doyle headlining the project. We've had the wonderful composer Mark Charles Smith at our side since the beginning as well. Quickly we grew to five members and now, for our April show, we are seven. Each dancer is uniquely highlighted in the show through a combination of solo, duet, and large group choreography. We are proud to present new and re-investigated work by Abigail and by <a href=""https://www.artful.ly/acw-dances"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">company</a> members Liz Naro, Paula Giammarco, and Ayelet Haran. Joining us onstage will be our good friends from Alexandria, Choreographer's Collaboration Project. </p><p>Additionally, ACW Dances is going on tour! The core company is traveling to Greensboro, NC, in May, to perform with Mark Charles Smith and two more classical guitarists. We're set to dance ""Solo Suites"" and ""Optimal Distinctiveness,"" work choreographed by Abigail and set to live music by Mark.</p>
<p>In order to produce our April show and get to Greensboro this May, we need your help on this campaign! We are extremely lucky this year to have been granted rehearsal and performance space through the Arlington Arts. However, we do not get any financial grants, so we must rely on the generosity of individual donors to pay our artists and turn the theater lights on. Here's what you're helping us cover:</p>

Please consider helping us in our artistic endeavor. Amounts raised in excess of $5,350 will go toward producing our 2015-16 season.</p><p>If you are unable to donate, you can still help!

<p><b>Contexte</b></p>
<p>En tant que citoyens du Québec, nous
nous sommes posé plusieurs questions sur la situation actuelle des relations
entre les francophones et les anglophones de Montréal. Quelle est la dynamique
en cours aujourd’hui et comment l’histoire l’a-t-elle façonnée? Avec la
présence de plus en plus importante des allophones, comment la cohabitation
entre les deux groupes évolue-t-elle?</p>
<p><b>Le théâtre playback</b></p>
<p>Peu de contextes de la vie sociale
contemporaine offrent l’occasion de s’asseoir ensemble et de simplement partager
des expériences vécues. Une représentation de théâtre Playback offre
précisément une telle possibilité. Le théâtre Playback consiste en des
improvisations à partir d’histoires que racontent spontanément des membres du
public et qui sont reproduites sur le champ par les comédiens. </p>
<p>Animés par le pouvoir unique de
réunir les gens qui caractérise leur forme d’art, les membres de <b>Promito

<ul>
<li>Notre projet consiste en trois représentations. <b>Promito Playback</b>
     invitera des <b>anglophones montréalais à une représentation</b>, durant laquelle l’accent
     sera mis sur leurs expériences. Dans la même veine, le groupe invitera des <b>francophones à une autre représentation</b>. Une troisième représentation permettra à <b>un public formé des deux groupes
     linguistiques de se rencontrer.</b> Nous les inviterons à mettre en commun
     leurs histoires respectives, ce que rendra possible une représentation
     bilingue. <b>Promito Playback</b> invitera après chaque représentation le public à manger,
     pour permettre aux spectateurs et aux comédiens de méditer sur leurs
     impressions, leurs émotions sur les moyens par lesquels il sera possible
     de poursuivre le dialogue dans l’avenir. </li>

des arts du Canada, « Différences/The clash » a su créer un dialogue
sur le thème de la communication à travers les différences.</p>

En tant que citoyens du Québec, nous
nous sommes posé plusieurs questions sur la situation actuelle des relations
entre les francophones et les anglophones de Montréal. Quelle est la dynamique
en cours aujourd’hui et comment l’histoire l’a-t-elle façonnée? Avec la
présence de plus en plus importante des allophones, comment la cohabitation
entre les deux groupes évolue-t-elle?
Le théâtre playback
Peu de contextes de la vie sociale
contemporaine offrent l’occasion de s’asseoir ensemble et de simplement partager
des expériences vécues. Une représentation de théâtre Playback offre
précisément une telle possibilité. Le théâtre Playback consiste en des
improvisations à partir d’histoires que racontent spontanément des membres du
public et qui sont reproduites sur le champ par les comédiens. 
Animés par le pouvoir unique de
réunir les gens qui caractérise leur forme d’art, les membres de Promito
Playback (http://www.promito-playback.com) une compagnie de théâtre bilingue basée à Montréal, ouvriront un dialogue
par lequel les anglophones et les francophones partageront leurs histoires et dévoileront
certaines réalités de leur cohabitation telle qu’ils la vivent aujourd’hui.
Trois spectacles:

Notre projet consiste en trois représentations. Promito Playback
     invitera des anglophones montréalais à une représentation, durant laquelle l’accent
     sera mis sur leurs expériences. Dans la même veine, le groupe invitera des francophones à une autre représentation. Une troisième représentation permettra à un public formé des deux groupes
     linguistiques de se rencontrer. Nous les inviterons à mettre en commun
     leurs histoires respectives, ce que rendra possible une représentation
     bilingue. Promito Playback invitera après chaque représentation le public à manger,
     pour permettre aux spectateurs et aux comédiens de méditer sur leurs
     impressions, leurs émotions sur les moyens par lesquels il sera possible
     de poursuivre le dialogue dans l’avenir. 




Représentation anglophone :Où : Église Saint-Monica, située au 6405 rue De TerrebonneQuand : mercredi 19 novembre à 20h



Représentation francophone :Où : Centre Culturel Calixa-Lavallée situé au 3819, rue Calixa-LavalléeQuand : mercredi 26 novembre à 20h

Représentation bilingue :Où : Théâtre MainLine, situé au 3997 Boulevard Saint-LaurentQuand : jeudi 5 février à 20h




Impact
Voici les objectifs de notre
projet :
-Initier un dialogue entre les deux communautés sur le thème de la langue et de la culture;
-Offrir à chaque groupe l’occasion de
comprendre l’ « autre » à travers la narration d’histoires
personnelles et leur exécution par les comédiens.
Ce projet est le premier en son genre
à créer, par un médium artistique, un dialogue public entre anglophones et
francophones à Montréal. Il procède d’un projet effectué en collaboration avec l’Aquarium
et le Globe : « Différences/The clash ». Financé par le Conseil
des arts du Canada, « Différences/The clash » a su créer un dialogue
sur le thème de la communication à travers les différences.
Les membres de Promito Playback ont
joué dans divers contextes très sensibles, notamment dans le cadre de leur
programme contre l'intimidation dans les écoles, la Semaine d'actions contre le racisme et la  Radicale Queer Semaine. Leurs grandes capacités de communication se sont

Context
As Quebec citizens, we've been asking ourselves lots of questions about relations between francophones and anglophones in Montreal today. What is the current dynamic and how does history play into it? With the increasing presence of allophones, how is the cohabitation of the two groups evolving? Playback TheatreThere are few public contexts in contemporary social life where people can sit together and simply share their experiences. A Playback theatre performance is exactly such a context. Playback is a form of improvisation in which audience members tell stories and actors enact those stories on the spot. Inspired by the unique capacity of this art form to allow people to meet, members of Promito Playback (http://www.promito-playback.com), a bilingual theatre company in Montreal, will open a dialogue for anglophones and francophones to share stories and uncover some realities of their cohabitation today.Three performances:Our project consists of three performances. Promito
Playback will invite francophone
Montrealers to the first performance, during which the focus will be their experiences. In the same spirit, the group will invite anglophones to a second performance. A
third performance will allow audience members

<p><br/><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, 2017: The Michele Brangwen Dance Ensemble in Concert, Featuring Two Premieres. MATCH, Matchbox 2, 3400 Main Street, Houston, TX </strong></p>
<p>The Michele Brangwen Dance Ensemble will premiere the third section in UNSANTO, a series of dance and music works that explore the changes to the food we eat and how these changes effect us. This third section will include choreography by Michele Brangwen, music by Grammy-nominated trumpeter and composer Tim Hagans, and set design and installation by Sandra Tapia Luna. The work will explore the idea of a label and its significance, and by extension what it means to exclude it. The set will include a sculpture by Sandra Tapia Luna made of labels that people from all across the country, and the communities surrounding the performance venue, have created themselves for a food that they eat. In other words labels that tell the story of an individual's relation to that food and where it comes from.<br/><br/>The program will also feature the premiere of SORROW, with choreography by Lindsey McGill and music by Hsin-Jung Tsai.  The work is based in part by the painter Vincent Van Gogh’s masterpiece drawing of a woman entitled Sorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Label Project Community Workshops In Preparation for Performances and Installation at the MATCH and a partnering gallery.  3 Locations Around Houston To Be Announced April 2017.</strong></p>
<p>The Michele Brangwen Dance Ensemble and visual artist Sandra Tapia Luna will present 3 workshops where members of the Houston community will create their own labels for foods that they eat. These handmade labels will tell the story of where the food comes from and what the food means to each individual. The labels will then be incorporated into a visual installation at the MATCH as part of our performances. Workshops will be free and conducted in both Spanish &amp; English.<br/> </p>

We have been performing since 1925, when we staged our first production of Wedding Bells. Since then we have been providing Rochester with live and wonderful theatrical entertainment.  In 1994 founding member Peter Scribner created the Rochester Shakespeare Players as a subgroup of the community players, where we staged our first production of Twelfth Night.  Throughout the last 22 years we have expanded our season to include two indoor productions that are staged at MuCCC, one in the Spring and another in the early Fall.  Our biggest production each year is our annual free Shakespeare in the park which we stage in conjunction with the Monroe County Park Department at the Highland Bowl.  We consider these shows to be our biggest undertaking of our season, and we draw on the support of our local community and our volunteer organization.  Each production we mount at the Highland Bowl required a substantial amount of money to cover the various production elements.  This Summer we are proud to be joining forced with the WallByrd Theater.  Virginia Monte, the Artistic Director of WallByrd Theater, and the Director of Romeo &amp; Juliet, is excited to be bringing this immortal love story to the Highland Bowl.<br/></p>
<p>This Summer we are mounting an incredibly complex production, which will involve incorporating rented scaffolding towers as part of the Director’s vision.  Since this is both a unique concept and a rare expense for us, we are seeking generous contributions and donations from the local community, and from you!  Your donation will help to bring this production to life.  We also need donations for sound equipment rental, costumes, weapons, lighting equipment and space rental, just to name a few items.  We truly cannot do this without you.<br/></p>
<p>Virginia’s vision doesn’t just end with the scaffolding.  She envisions Romeo &amp; Juliet as anime and Shakespeare colliding, creating a beautiful, sexy spin on one of the most classic love stories told by the Bard.  We have a wealth of new young talent to make her vision come to life. The story will be set in a run down, old church heaped in scaffolding and stained glass.  We even have a company turning anime prints into reality, making the costumes come to life.  In fact, you can even buy one of these prints made for the show, or even have a costume made for yourself.  Check out our perks for more details!<br/>
For this production we will need:<br/>
$1,000 Weapons Rental<br/>
$1,000 Fight Director Fee<br/>
$3,000 Sound Equipment Rental<br/>
$1,000 Set Rental<br/>
And this does not include all of our other expenses.<br/></p>
<p>Performances are at the Highland Park Bowl in Rochester, New York and begin at 8 p.m. each evening July 15 to 30, with no shows on Mondays and Thursdays. Refreshments will be sold each night at the bowl, which is off South Avenue. Admission is free. Limited seating will be provided, so audience members may want to bring a lawn chair or blanket and bug repellant. </p></div>","Hello everyone!

<h3>Crimson Square &amp; Emerging Writer's Lab</h3>
<p>Doing theatre can be a daunting, expensive challenge. Many self-motivated performers end up scraping budgets together from their own pockets. Many writing programs are very expensive and difficult to gain access to. Getting regular readings and feedback on a writing project can be costly and frustrating. This is not a sustainable way to create art! Why put on a show for four weeks that may take you months, if not years to financially recover from. Is there a way to make the shows less expensive? What if all these talented people had a little help? This is where we come in! </p>
<p>Our Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund a minimum of 5 shows per year at a professional level</li>
<li>Each show will provide the opportunity for someone less experienced to get mentorship from someone who is experienced in that role, whether directing, producing, acting, lighting, stage managing, writing, etc.</li>
<li>Create an on-going writer's lab to provide affordable and accessible regular feedback and readings on new and emerging writers.</li>
<li>Eventually, produce new works and world premieres that have developed by emerging artists from conception/writing to full stage performance.</li>
<li>We are being generously sponsored by the non-profit 501c3 Cheshire Moon (mentoring on how to successfully run a non-profit educational program) and the Beverly Hills Playhouse (providing beautiful facilities and many years of high quality training experience) for our first year. This means that your donations will count as tax deductible. And that even at the foundational level, Crimson Square's concept of mentorship and learning from those with more experience is being put into practice!</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be providing for the opportunities and education of so many artists and new talents. Please donate today to help us create a supportive, sustainable platform for new artists to gain invaluable experience in theatre!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are trying to raise $20,000 (launch our first couple shows and few months of the lab) with a stretch goal of $30,000 (lock in the lab for the year and extend development to our next few shows)</li>
<li>We are giving out all kinds of incentives! But mostly, we would love for you to come to see one of our shows!!! Our swag ranges from stickers and mugs, to ad space in our program and free tickets to the entire season. Check it out and claim your swag!!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use what we raise to put on our first show and the first 8 weeks of the writer's lab. From there we will continue fundraising for the rest of the year.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why help us?</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can be part of the development and growth of so many artists, who doesn't want to do that?!?</li>
<li>Although challenges and pitfalls as to be expected with any new venture, with guidance from our experienced mentors and sponsors, we will have support to grow and learn from any obstacles that arise.</li>
<li>You can (literally) watch us grow! From actual performances and open readings, we will have shows and showcases on stage all year round, which means you get the chance to see in real time where your contributions are directly leading to artistic growth and education. How many programs can offer that?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Involving students with mentors means that there will be some learning curves throughout the journey. Putting on professional shows is a huge undertaking. Some shows may not be perfect, some issues may arise throughout the first year, things don't always go as planned, but each struggle has its own lesson.</p>
<ul>
<li>Thankfully we are not taking this journey alone! Between Cheshire Moon and Beverly Hills Playhouse, our project has lots of good guidance.</li>
<li>Each step of the way, we are reaching out to someone who has successfully accomplished what we are trying to do and ask for their advice on how to do it well. Even if we run into an unforeseen obstacle, we will always turn to someone who has overcome it before and then overcome it together!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money isn't always just lying around to donate to the arts, we get it!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you cannot give financially, please help by spreading the word. Social media, email, and word of mouth are some of the biggest gifts you could give us!</li>
<li>Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! They have made it extra easy to spread the word!</li>
</ul>

You will be providing for the opportunities and education of so many artists and new talents. Please donate today to help us create a supportive, sustainable platform for new artists to gain invaluable experience in theatre!

What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

We are trying to raise $20,000 (launch our first couple shows and few months of the lab) with a stretch goal of $30,000 (lock in the lab for the year and extend development to our next few shows)
We are giving out all kinds of incentives! But mostly, we would love for you to come to see one of our shows!!! Our swag ranges from stickers and mugs, to ad space in our program and free tickets to the entire season. Check it out and claim your swag!!
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use what we raise to put on our first show and the first 8 weeks of the writer's lab. From there we will continue fundraising for the rest of the year.


Why help us?

You can be part of the development and growth of so many artists, who doesn't want to do that?!?
Although challenges and pitfalls as to be expected with any new venture, with guidance from our experienced mentors and sponsors, we will have support to grow and learn from any obstacles that arise.
You can (literally) watch us grow! From actual performances and open readings, we will have shows and showcases on stage all year round, which means you get the chance to see in real time where your contributions are directly leading to artistic growth and education. How many programs can offer that?


Risks & Challenges
Involving students with mentors means that there will be some learning curves throughout the journey. Putting on professional shows is a huge undertaking. Some shows may not be perfect, some issues may arise throughout the first year, things don't always go as planned, but each struggle has its own lesson.

Thankfully we are not taking this journey alone! Between Cheshire Moon and Beverly Hills Playhouse, our project has lots of good guidance.
Each step of the way, we are reaching out to someone who has successfully accomplished what we are trying to do and ask for their advice on how to do it well. Even if we run into an unforeseen obstacle, we will always turn to someone who has overcome it before and then overcome it together!


Other Ways You Can Help
Money isn't always just lying around to donate to the arts, we get it!

If you cannot give financially, please help by spreading the word. Social media, email, and word of mouth are some of the biggest gifts you could give us!
Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! They have made it extra easy to spread the word!

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/itsxabox/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It's Not a Box Theatre</a> is dedicated to staging devised, interactive work that explores untold stories and experiments with what it truly means to play. Our newest and most ambitious work is <a href=""http://overhearproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Overhear Project</a>. </p>
<p>After two successful productions in Saskatoon, we have assembled teams from around the world (Saskatoon, Toronto, Vancouver, and Paris) to engage with their respective newcomer communities and Indigenous communities to find stories of home and belonging --- and people to tell them, both artists and non-artists.  </p>
<p>The result: four entirely unique interactive outdoor pod-plays, each with their own stories and cast. Audiences are invited <i>one at a time</i> to embark on an outdoor journey, guided by audio narration via a smartphone app, and encounter storytellers who will open their hearts and share their stories -- one listener at a time.</p>
<p>We are looking for funding from you to help us create a new community of artists and audiences! We also can't ask people to do this work for free -- we believe in paying our artists what they are worth, and that is directly where your money will go. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $12,000 to make sure that all of the artists in this project are being paid fairly. That's it -- helping real people make a living, pay their rent, eat healthy food, and not need to work multiple jobs every day. We have received funding from the <a href=""http://www.saskartsboard.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saskatchewan Arts Board</a> that covers about 15% of our budget. In order to keep this show accessible, we also aren't setting ticket prices, but rather allowing people to pay what they want to after they have seen the show. Tickets and merchandise sales will not be enough to cover our budget which consists almost entirely of artist fees. </p>
<p>If we aren't able to reach our goal, the money we do make will be split equally between the artists in each city. Any little bit will help us out.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the wonderful merchandise in our perks will encourage a lot of donations and we will be able to reach our goal! But we can't do it without you. Even if you don't have any money to give, please tell your friends about the show, share the campaign on Facebook and Twitter, or come see us and pay what you can afford to participate in these stories first hand.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we are able to raise enough funds to adequately pay our artists, the resulting show will not only have an impact on the audience who sees it, but to everyone who has ever felt lonely in an unfamiliar place. </p>
<p>After the live portion of Overhear wraps in each city we will be releasing the Overhear app to the general public, allowing them to listen to any story from the show. Soon after, we intend to open up the platform to ANYONE around the world to write, record, share, and even stage their very own pod-plays -- performed and priced however they like. This has the capacity to not just create a rich digital tapestry of geotagged interactive stories, but to foster a new intimate relationship between our technology, our humanity, and our community. With enough support, we hope to inspire creativity within a new art form and help bring the world a little closer together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges we face are that international projects are enormous, ambitious, and need a lot of time and investment to make successful. We are working in multiple languages, across time zones, and with people with different understandings of the world. We are young artists who are learning a lot along the way. We are a small company with no established physical location, no large store of funds, and this is our first foray into international production. Every $5 we raise is one less thing we have to worry about, and allows us to focus on the things we need to learn in order to make this show exactly what we dream it could be -- and don't worry, we are learning fast. We are dedicated artists experienced in various forms of independent producing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't forget that you aren't obligated to buy a perk -- you can set your own donation amount (even $5!) and we appreciate that just as much. We understand that not everyone has cash to spare. But please consider sharing this campaign on your social media, or even attending the show in your community. We would love to see you there.

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Classical Theatre Company is the only professional theatre company in Houston, TX that produces year round classical drama. We were honored in 2016 to be one of only 7 companies in the country to be first-time recipients of the prestigious National Theatre Company Grant Award by the American Theatre Wing (the same folks who run the Tony Awards). Now entering our 11th season, CTC looks to expand its programming with more free readings, single night events, a Lecture Series, and more! But in order to keep our readings free and our ticket prices low, we need your support!</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>The Classical Theatre Company is dedicated to boldly re-envisioning classical drama on the stage, in the community, and in the classroom through engaging and enlightening plays - bringing them new life and relevance while maintaining the integrity that the works deserve.</p>
<p><strong>The Skinny...</strong></p>
<p>Classical Theatre Company needs some funds to get our 11th season moving. Funds are always harder to come by early in our season, and so this campaign will help us get our first production off the ground, help us to continue renovation on our facility and ensure that our Shakespeare Outreach program will continue to provide high quality programming by bringing Shakespeare out to the underserved schools, community centers, and population of Houston.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>Some seed money to help us begin funding the first production of the 2018-2019 Mainstage Season - The Return of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle. This production will cost approximately $40,000, and since only about 30% of those costs will be covered by ticket sales, the balance will need to be raised from other sources.</p>
<p><strong>What You Can Do:</strong></p>
<p>Donate, donate, and donate! Additionally if you have any services, materials, or other in-kind donations in lieu of monetary contributions, please contact us at info@classicaltheatre.org</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Your funds will go directly into our operations costs, both artistic and administrative. They will help provide wages for our artists and technicians as well as purchase costumes and scenery and supplies necessary for our Shakespeare Outreach program. Your generosity is what allows us to continue to bring high-quality and critically-acclaimed classical productions to our young and growing audience on our stage, and help to bring Shakespeare to our constituents out in the community.</p>

<br/><br/><h3>
</h3><p><b>IF YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT
THE PLAY AND OUR TEAM, READ THIS…</b></p>
<p>Some of the greatest critical and
commercial successes in the 32 year history of Hollywood’s respected acting
company Theatre of NOTE have come from the works of playwright Erik Patterson.
His four NOTE productions account for almost one third of all Ovation Award
nominations in NOTE’s history.<span>  His last
two plays, RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT and HE ASKED FOR IT, both received “Best
Original Play” nominations and were remounted in larger venues due to ticket
demand.  ALL of his full length plays
received the difficult to achieve LA Weekly “Theatre Pick of the Week.”  </span></p><p><span>
</span></p><p>His latest play “I WANNA HOLD YOUR
HAND” explores how our lives can change in an instant.<span>  One moment you’re getting engaged and a few
surreal moments later you’re sitting among a group of strangers in a hospital
waiting room praying that your fiancé will survive a brain aneurysm. At least,
that’s what happens to Ada.  While
waiting for Frank to wake up from a coma she meets Julia, Paul and Josh who are
waiting for their mom to recover as well. 
A tenuous friendship is born. 
These characters take a look at life, death and recovery, and what all
of that means when you step back out of the waiting room and try your hand at
living again.</span><br/></p><p><span>
</span></p><p>The show is slated to open at our
theatre on 1517 Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood on August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014
with talented director McKerrin Kelly at the helm. Our design team includes, William Moore Jr. doing scenic
design, Boscoe Flanagan designing lights, and Tony nominated sound designer
Cricket S. Myers providing sound.<span>  </span></p>

YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BEATLES PERKS, READ THIS…</b></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/584513/files/20140516145316-perks_3.JPG?1400277196"" src="""" style=""""/><p><b>
</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p>The Beatle related items were
collected by one of our producers, who was an avid fan back in 1964, the year
“I Want To Hold Your Hand” was released.<span> 
These are all guaranteed 1960’s originals, not reproductions.  As so many items are unique, perk categories
are not cumulative, items offered are specific to that price point only, and
once they are claimed that category is finished.  </span></p>
<p>Here are some details about the
perks:</p><p>
</p><p>BEATLE TRADING CARDS, all originally purchased in
1964, each card delivered in a protective plastic sleeve.<span>  The first Beatle Trading Cards issued by
Topps were B&amp;W (series #1) with Blue facsimile autograph of one Beatle,
followed by Series 2 &amp; 3 all in 1964 at the height of “Beatlemania”.  Special “Hard Days Night” and color cards
also followed in 1964. These cards are 50 years old, and were collected by a
child, so condition is not “mint.”  Most
cards are in fairly good condition, however. 
Cards with obvious damage (folds, writing, and tape residue from
childish attempts at displaying them) are offered in a separate category.  </span></p>
<p>PIECE OF NUMBER 10 MATTHEW STREET, LIVERPOOL: – The
building housing the original Cavern Club, the “cellar full of noise” the
Beatles played so often before international fame hit, closed in 1973 and was
demolished to make way for a subway ventilation shaft (for a train line that
was never built!). A “facsimile” opened
across the street, and when our Beatle obsessed producer visited the new club
in August of 1974 and the manager brought him across the street to show him the
remains of the original building.<span>  The
manager unlocked the fence so our producer could take a small chunk of brick
from the rubble.  Chips from this unusual
souvenir are being offered in three perks: “I Love John”; “I Love Paul” and “I
Want to Hold Your Hand”.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/584517/files/20140516145429-perks_1a.JPG?1400277269"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>ORIGINAL PICTURE SLEEVE– Framed.<span>  (45rpm record not included.)  The sleeve shows some signs of age and wear,
and a small hole where Woolworth’s had stapled on a price tag (see photo, under
the “H” in “THE”) </span></p>
<p>Theatre of NOTE is a 501(C) 3 tax exempt institution,
so your donations are tax deductible.<span> 
You will receive a donation letter, but we are required by law to deduct
the value of the merchandise sent.  For
perks involving Beatle Memorabilia, we will deduct 20% from the donation total
for merchandise value.  Some of the
individual cards may actually be worth a lot more (see </span><a href=""http://en.wikicollecting.org/the-beatles-trading-cards"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikicollecting.org/the-beatles-trading-cards</a>) but setting exact values on
collectables is difficult.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3>BLACK LIGHT BEATLE POSTER PERK INCENTIVE<br/>
</h3>The first person to win any one of the following perks also gets this classic (ca 1970) black light poster featuring The Beatles:<br/>--THE I LOVE GEORGE<br/>--THE I LOVE RINGO<br/>--THE I LOVE JOHN<br/>--THE I LOVE PAUL<br/>--THE I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND<br/><br/>There is only one poster.... so only the FIRST person to claim one of these five perks gets this.... (pretty cool eh?)  <br/>Note: The poster is NOT mint condition, it hung on a wall in the 70's, there is tape residue on the back and some loss of paint along the edges from being rolled up for storage (see photo below) but overall in pretty nice shape for it's age.  <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/656171/files/20140617144641-Beatles_poster.JPG?1403041601"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p>

company Theatre of NOTE have come from the works of playwright Erik Patterson.
His four NOTE productions account for almost one third of all Ovation Award
nominations in NOTE’s history.  His last
two plays, RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT and HE ASKED FOR IT, both received “Best
Original Play” nominations and were remounted in larger venues due to ticket
demand.  ALL of his full length plays
received the difficult to achieve LA Weekly “Theatre Pick of the Week.”  
His latest play “I WANNA HOLD YOUR
HAND” explores how our lives can change in an instant.  One moment you’re getting engaged and a few
surreal moments later you’re sitting among a group of strangers in a hospital
waiting room praying that your fiancé will survive a brain aneurysm. At least,
that’s what happens to Ada.  While
waiting for Frank to wake up from a coma she meets Julia, Paul and Josh who are
waiting for their mom to recover as well. 
A tenuous friendship is born. 
These characters take a look at life, death and recovery, and what all
of that means when you step back out of the waiting room and try your hand at
living again.
The show is slated to open at our
theatre on 1517 Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood on August 1st, 2014
with talented director McKerrin Kelly at the helm. Our design team includes, William Moore Jr. doing scenic
design, Boscoe Flanagan designing lights, and Tony nominated sound designer
Cricket S. Myers providing sound.  
  
IF
YOU WANT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BEATLES PERKS, READ THIS…

The Beatle related items were
collected by one of our producers, who was an avid fan back in 1964, the year
“I Want To Hold Your Hand” was released. 
These are all guaranteed 1960’s originals, not reproductions.  As so many items are unique, perk categories
are not cumulative, items offered are specific to that price point only, and
once they are claimed that category is finished.  
Here are some details about the
perks:
BEATLE TRADING CARDS, all originally purchased in
1964, each card delivered in a protective plastic sleeve.  The first Beatle Trading Cards issued by
Topps were B&W (series #1) with Blue facsimile autograph of one Beatle,
followed by Series 2 & 3 all in 1964 at the height of “Beatlemania”.  Special “Hard Days Night” and color cards
also followed in 1964. These cards are 50 years old, and were collected by a
child, so condition is not “mint.”  Most
cards are in fairly good condition, however. 
Cards with obvious damage (folds, writing, and tape residue from
childish attempts at displaying them) are offered in a separate category.  
PIECE OF NUMBER 10 MATTHEW STREET, LIVERPOOL: – The
building housing the original Cavern Club, the “cellar full of noise” the
Beatles played so often before international fame hit, closed in 1973 and was
demolished to make way for a subway ventilation shaft (for a train line that
was never built!). A “facsimile” opened
across the street, and when our Beatle obsessed producer visited the new club
in August of 1974 and the manager brought him across the street to show him the
remains of the original building.  The
manager unlocked the fence so our producer could take a small chunk of brick
from the rubble.  Chips from this unusual
souvenir are being offered in three perks: “I Love John”; “I Love Paul” and “I
Want to Hold Your Hand”.

ORIGINAL PICTURE SLEEVE– Framed.  (45rpm record not included.)  The sleeve shows some signs of age and wear,
and a small hole where Woolworth’s had stapled on a price tag (see photo, under
the “H” in “THE”) 
Theatre of NOTE is a 501(C) 3 tax exempt institution,
so your donations are tax deductible. 
You will receive a donation letter, but we are required by law to deduct
the value of the merchandise sent.  For
perks involving Beatle Memorabilia, we will deduct 20% from the donation total
for merchandise value.  Some of the
individual cards may actually be worth a lot more (see http://en.wikicollecting.org/the-beatles-trading-cards) but setting exact values on
collectables is difficult.BLACK LIGHT BEATLE POSTER PERK INCENTIVE
The first person to win any one of the following perks also gets this classic (ca 1970) black light poster featuring The Beatles:--THE I LOVE GEORGE--THE I LOVE RINGO--THE I LOVE JOHN--THE I LOVE PAUL--THE I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HANDThere is only one poster.... so only the FIRST person to claim one of these five perks gets this.... (pretty cool eh?)  Note: The poster is NOT mint condition, it hung on a wall in the 70's, there is tape residue on the back and some loss of paint along the edges from being rolled up for storage (see photo below) but overall in pretty nice shape for it's age.",4.0,0,"4 Campaigns

""Bianca, of course with a play, so much depends on how it is staged before, who is performing, etc. But what you have here is both lively and substantive.""                                                           Howard Zinn
DIRECTORJosh Chambers was the Artistic Director & Resident Composer of Fovea Floods
Theater from 1996 – 2008 where he created over 30 productions. 
""Having directed Howard before, I share his desire to connect with our ancestry and dig deep into history.""                                                                 Josh Chambers 
PRODUCERSMichael Blaha and Nigel Miles-Thomas have been taking plays to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival for over 14 years. In fact they had a hit play there last year. Here they are and if you want to read more about them:                                                    Fringe Management SiteSONG CLIP:""A Sailor Went to Sea, Sea, Sea"" :30        SONG LYRICS FROM THE PLAY:               Who
are you making war against?
             The
tyrant or his people?
             Because
the people of Iraq,
             and
the people of Afghanistan,
             are
people like us. 
             People
like you and me.
             Like
the kids in school 
             on every Main Street.






""The term 'just war' contains an internal contradiction. War is inherently
unjust, and the great challenge of our time is how to deal with evil, tyranny,
and oppression without killing huge numbers of people.""                                                            Howard Zinn
Theater forces an audience to come face to face with issues, there is not mute button here. Howard wrote three plays himself as he realized the impact of his words. We can do this together. One small act is all it takes!

""Exciting project.Very clever title! Howard would chuckle.""  


David Barsamian, ALTERNATIVE RADIOhttp://www.alternativeradio.org




""Howard would sooooo appreciate this project!""

Paul Alan Smith - Howard's Hollywood Agent





""We need to decide that we will not go to
war, whatever reason is conjured up by the politicians or the media, because
war in our time is always indiscriminate, a war against innocents, a war
against children. War is terrorism,
magnified a hundred times.""
Howard  Zinn
THE WORLD IS MADE OF SMALL ACTS.

ANY SMALL ACT WILL DO.
HOW DID GREAT MOVEMENTS START?
THE PEOPLE SAW IT THROUGH.

<h3 align=""center"">This year’s<em> Not-Two Is Peace</em> Dance event is pivotal for the future of this unique collaboration.</h3>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><strong><strong>THE EVENT</strong></strong></h3>
<div>Over July 22 and 23 in a spectacular multi-media event at Florence’s Bargello Museum—one of the city’s most prized historic buildings—the grace and talent of dancers and musicians will combine with Adi Da's Art.</div>
<div><em><strong> </strong></em></div>
<div>
<em><strong><em><strong>Not-Two <span>Is</span> Peace </strong></em>is an adaptation by the Florence Dance Company of the masterpiece book by world friend Adi Da<em><strong>. </strong></em>Not-Two <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is</span> Peace </strong></em>is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Florence Dance Company and the Art of Adi Da,  that began in July of 2008 in a Piazza in Florence, Italy. Since then 3 major ballets that have been performed in Italy in the course of over 50 public shows. This now continues in 2012.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Florence Dance Company</h3>
<p>The resident company, and producers of the Florence Dance Festival now in it's 23rd year, is The Florence Dance Company. Artistic direction is led by its founders Marga Nativo and Keith Ferrone.  The choreography for this event is by Keith Ferrone, with Mario Ancilloti directing the orchestral ensemble. Original music will be contributed by premier Florentine composer Andrea Portera and by Naamleela Free Jones, who will also perform live.</p>
<p>By helping to support this event at this crucial time you are helping us to bring the whole ballet to a level that will go well beyond the Renaissance City of Florence, Italy with the creation of a 3D film in one of Italy's most majestic theaters, Teatro della Pergola, which is already on the planned schedule for 2013. </p>
<h3>Not-Two <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is</span> Peace Dance film in 3D</h3>
<p>We have recently joined forces with an award-winning 3D filmmaker, <a href=""http://icolorist.com/instructors/dado-valentic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dado Valentic</a>. <strong><em>Not-Two <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is</span> Peace Dance</em></strong> will be recorded as a ninety-minute 3D feature to be screened in theatres internationally. Heading up the team for the 3D film of Not-Two Is Peace will be Dado Valentic and London Director Terry Gross. Both are considered to be the UK’s top 3D specialists. Dado’s past work includes Harry Potter movies. Filming the performance is a natural albeit, until recently, wholly unexpected, extension of the work’s multi-media ethos. We are looking forward to some compelling results!</p>
<p>Once we have pre-production financing, with any excess funding we can move forward with the promotional trailer to seek broadcaster financing for the feature-length film we are set out to create.  In order for us to deliver the quality documentary film, we need funding. With your funding help through Indiegogo, we'll be able to move forward on this film with less of a funding hurdle. </p>
<h3><strong>HOW TO SUPPORT</strong></h3>
<p>With arts funding being cut in cities all over the world, and pretty drastically in Italy, it <em>will take a community</em> to actually keep the show on the road. Crowdfunding on Indiegogo is a model that ties in with some of the keys messages of the book <em>Not-Two Is Peace bin that this is an ""everybody all-at-once"" </em>model that has the potential to make great things happen, or where a collective of small ripples can make the wave.</p>
<p>Your funds will help with production costs for the July 23rd <em><strong>Not-Two <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is</span> Peace <br/></strong></em>Dance event so that the event is successful.  Initial funds will go directly the cover essential production costs, including lighting, performers and promotion.  What is raised here through Indiegogo is our last chance to make this happen. Your support will directly help complete the production in order to bring this incredible performance to the world this July, along with supporting the future of this collaboration. </p>
<p>In exchange there are many wonderful incentives such as a beautiful image from the dance fabricated in Glass which is 3 feet wide by 4 feet high.   With great perks on offer in return for your support- this is a fun and easy way to take part.</p>

<p><b>About
Us!  </b></p>
<p>Founded in 2009, P.E.A.R.L.S is a community based program
focused on empowering and mentoring girls, aged 5 -1 8 in Washington, DC. Our after-school
programs focus on character development, community service, academic excellence
and health and fitness. Our goal is to reduce teen pregnancy by 10% by 2023
while encouraging our sisters to be Powerful Educated Ambitious Respected
Liberated Sisters. </p>
<p>Over the past four years, we’ve managed partnerships at
Cesar Chavez Charter School - Parkside Campus, Hart Middle School, Fort Davis
Community Center and Center City Charter School - Capitol Hill Campus. This
school year, we’ve added Cesar Chavez Charter School - Capitol Hill Campus and
SEED Public Charter School to our roster. </p>
<p><b>Why do

<p>
</p>
<p>We’re bringing the P.E.A.R.L.S movement to the theater with
<i><b>The P.E.A.R.L.S Monologues: For Young Girls Who Wear Pearls</b></i> and we need your
help to raise a portion of the funds, to start the development and production phase.</p>
<p>These intimate and personal stories will bring awareness to
the challenges teen girls face and their efforts to overcome them. We, their
parents, teachers, administrators, youth advocates and peers, need to hear
these stories. They need to make some noise, so we can hear and better
understand them. </p>
<p>There will be 5 performances in Washington, DC, starting in
the Spring 2014 and a grand finale at the 2014 DC Capital Summer Fringe
Festival. </p>
<p>Our monologues are:</p>

About
Us!  
Founded in 2009, P.E.A.R.L.S is a community based program
focused on empowering and mentoring girls, aged 5 -1 8 in Washington, DC. Our after-school
programs focus on character development, community service, academic excellence
and health and fitness. Our goal is to reduce teen pregnancy by 10% by 2023
while encouraging our sisters to be Powerful Educated Ambitious Respected
Liberated Sisters. 
Over the past four years, we’ve managed partnerships at
Cesar Chavez Charter School - Parkside Campus, Hart Middle School, Fort Davis
Community Center and Center City Charter School - Capitol Hill Campus. This
school year, we’ve added Cesar Chavez Charter School - Capitol Hill Campus and
SEED Public Charter School to our roster. 
Why do
we need the P.E.A.R.L.S Monologues??? 


We’re bringing the P.E.A.R.L.S movement to the theater with
The P.E.A.R.L.S Monologues: For Young Girls Who Wear Pearls and we need your
help to raise a portion of the funds, to start the development and production phase.
These intimate and personal stories will bring awareness to
the challenges teen girls face and their efforts to overcome them. We, their
parents, teachers, administrators, youth advocates and peers, need to hear
these stories. They need to make some noise, so we can hear and better
understand them. 
There will be 5 performances in Washington, DC, starting in
the Spring 2014 and a grand finale at the 2014 DC Capital Summer Fringe
Festival. 
Our monologues are:




Leave Me Be (bullying)


Single Young Mom (teen parenting)


Black & Blue (teen dating
violence)


Nickles & Dimes (poverty
and homelessness)


SistaMom (raising siblings)


No, Not There (sexual abuse)


Jump In (gang violence)


Beyond (college bound)


My Parachute (LGBT)


Daddy’s Girl? (abandonment,
single parent household)


Mirror, Mirror (self-esteem,
puberty)


Turn Up (substance, alcohol
& drug abuse)


Picture Freak (social media, sexting &
online dating)





This is how we want to say
thank you…..(see our great perks to the right).
Here’s how your generous contributions will be disbursed for the development and production stages:
$15,900 - Hire production staff and creative staff, purchase costumes, equipment, props
       ​and travel expenses.
$8,950 -  Rent space for auditions and rehearsals and secure venues.

<p>‘For How Much?’ is choreographed by Annarita Mazzilli with original score by composer Andy Higgs.</p>
<p>Using a mixture of live and recorded music this dance theatre piece raises questions about human trafficking for forced labour, and how what we buy affects the lives of others. Originally commissioned by the International Organization for Migration U.K. (IOM) as part of their <em>Buy Responsibly</em> campaign, this piece takes inspiration from the lives of the people who have worked under forced labour in India, Africa, South America and parts of Europe and from the sculptures by London-based artist May Ayres and her critique of consumerism and capitalism. <a href=""http://mayayres.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mayayres.com/index.html</a></p>

<p>WE CAN'T HEAL THE WOUNDS of Suicide</p>
<p>The <strong>Emerson Theater Collaborative</strong> and New York Playwright, Suicide Activitst, Producer and Actor, <strong>Josh Rivedal</strong> express our commitment to finding a solution to Suicide by creating the I AM WORTHY PROJECT.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Problems are temporary. Suicide is permanent<em>. </em></strong> </p>
<p>Using Theater to find the solution is the cure.</p>
<h2> I AM WORTHY PROJECT</h2>
<div>
<p>On April 5th -7th , 2013 The Emerson Theater Collaborative will embark on a three day educational seminar &amp; performance by Joshua Rivedal (The Gospel According to Josh) - A one man show that encompasses a 15 character, 7 song show, about a small town boy who follows his dreams to Hollywood despite the tempestuous relationship with his pious father. Along the way he must navigate his religious upbringing, an escape to New York, his starring roles in two reality TV shows,and ultimately his father's tragic suicide.</p>
<p>This weekend movement will begin the conversation about suicide prevention awareness that will continue on monthly basis within our surrounding communities. </p>
<p><strong>This is a community wide event open to all</strong></p>
<p>Our goals are ambitous!</p>
<p>To provide an educational outreach arts community program that brings about awareness, prevention and educational solutions for the treatment of suicide prevention. It is our hope to use this production to show how theater arts can be use as an educational outlet to educate people and save lives. Suicide is an <em><strong>epidemic</strong></em>, and we realize more than ever the need to have a conversation within our communities, to help heal the wounds associated with suicide. The need to look at the root causes of this epidemic is of valuable importance to all of us. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To enlist the help of our community, educators, business leaders, law enforcement and elected officials to open the door to educating themselves and others about suicide. To provide the help, nurturing, love and guidance for youth, adults, military veterans, law enforcement and other professionals who cannot find a way out.</p>
<strong>We believe we can we win the battle by using theater to open the door.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The funds raised will go to producing ""<em><strong>The Gospel According to Josh""</strong></em>, educating our patrons, and communities about suicide, and its devistating effects. The funds will also provide QPR training for those patrons, business leaders and teens who wish to help save lives.</div>

I work professionally as a stage director, conductor, producer and stage manager of opera and classical music. I am passionately interested in everything that the world of classical music has to offer. And I love every aspect of theatre! My most inspiring education came from working at the Royal Opera House (ROH) in London UK. There I attended every event from opera to ballet. I savoured the world's best productions and artists.</p>
<p>I started this company to do something really different with opera and other staged works. After experiencing the creativity of the Royal Opera House, in London UK, I felt that Canada really deserves the same.</p>
<p>I don’t want to copy what I experienced; I want to add a unique voice to the international stage. I want Canada to have something to say about Opera in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Canada is known for having incredible artists but rarely do we get the international recognition. To be recognized we need to push the envelope with a new ideas. No copying, no regurgitation, no recreations. We need to explore new creations. The talent exists to create new performance art and Loose TEA is the vehicle and platform to express these new ideas and herald in a new movement of Opera experiences.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT LOOSE TEA Music Theatre</strong></p>
<p>Savouring the delicious diverse flavours in a cup of fine tea inspires the senses. LOOSE TEA Music Theatre is a new company who is exploring the flavours of music from the refined traditional with the excitement of diversity.</p>
<p>LOOSE TEA draws its strong inspiration from the mechanics and artistry of a score mixed with the influence of talented musicians to create new affecting sounds. LOOSE TEA is a creative exploration of how opera and theatre can interact with each other. This is a company that focuses on the ""nitty-gritty"" of character - a concept where music comes from the depths of an actor's analysis and their journey on stage.</p>
<p>We seek to collaborate with artists in all disciplines to explore different textures and flavours. We want to explore the boundaries of a work to see how far they can be pushed while still maintaining the integrity of the original intention.</p>
<p>The productions aim to be accessible to a broad audience. The talent is spectacular. The artistic direction imagines a world that has never been experienced before. With our brilliant production team on deck, LOOSE TEA is able to embark on an incredible journey that will be sure to leave the audience begging for a second cup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p>LOOSE TEA, like any performance art form, exists to helps us understand and experience life in a way that no other medium can. Music is a universal language. Singing uses the most basic of human communication – the human voice. We have a dedicated, talented and experienced performers and production team for this inaugural presentation for LOOSE TEA.</p>

<p> </p></span></div>","I am Alaina Viau. I work professionally as a stage director, conductor, producer and stage manager of opera and classical music. I am passionately interested in everything that the world of classical music has to offer. And I love every aspect of theatre! My most inspiring education came from working at the Royal Opera House (ROH) in London UK. There I attended every event from opera to ballet. I savoured the world's best productions and artists.
I started this company to do something really different with opera and other staged works. After experiencing the creativity of the Royal Opera House, in London UK, I felt that Canada really deserves the same.
I don’t want to copy what I experienced; I want to add a unique voice to the international stage. I want Canada to have something to say about Opera in the 21st century. Canada is known for having incredible artists but rarely do we get the international recognition. To be recognized we need to push the envelope with a new ideas. No copying, no regurgitation, no recreations. We need to explore new creations. The talent exists to create new performance art and Loose TEA is the vehicle and platform to express these new ideas and herald in a new movement of Opera experiences.
ABOUT LOOSE TEA Music Theatre
Savouring the delicious diverse flavours in a cup of fine tea inspires the senses. LOOSE TEA Music Theatre is a new company who is exploring the flavours of music from the refined traditional with the excitement of diversity.
LOOSE TEA draws its strong inspiration from the mechanics and artistry of a score mixed with the influence of talented musicians to create new affecting sounds. LOOSE TEA is a creative exploration of how opera and theatre can interact with each other. This is a company that focuses on the ""nitty-gritty"" of character - a concept where music comes from the depths of an actor's analysis and their journey on stage.
We seek to collaborate with artists in all disciplines to explore different textures and flavours. We want to explore the boundaries of a work to see how far they can be pushed while still maintaining the integrity of the original intention.
The productions aim to be accessible to a broad audience. The talent is spectacular. The artistic direction imagines a world that has never been experienced before. With our brilliant production team on deck, LOOSE TEA is able to embark on an incredible journey that will be sure to leave the audience begging for a second cup.
 
Our Team
LOOSE TEA, like any performance art form, exists to helps us understand and experience life in a way that no other medium can. Music is a universal language. Singing uses the most basic of human communication – the human voice. We have a dedicated, talented and experienced performers and production team for this inaugural presentation for LOOSE TEA.

<p>This year I have the honour of being invited to perform at the 8th Annual Fire Dance Expo in San Francisco, and I need your help to get there. I am one of only two Canadian male solo fire spinners invited to perform this year. As an Indigenous artist I am proud to represent Canada and our Indigenous people. I hope you can help me make it there.  </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Airfare: As of March 25<sup>th</sup>, return flights from Toronto to San Francisco for April 25<sup>th</sup> are approx $500. This is all I am asking for, help getting there and back.</p>
<p>The perks listed for this campaign come from my love for my art form. As a professional fire spinner I have a number of videos of my public performances and some promotional videos as well. Donations of $50 or more receive increasing video rewards and my sincere thanks.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my full funding goals, I will put whatever is raised towards the cost of airfare. Every little bit helps, so please give what you can.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I grew up on a reservation in Northern Ontario called Constance Lake. When I was there I dreamed of seeing the world and of doing great things with my life. I have traveled Canada extensively and feel it is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Now is my chance to make my first ever journey out of Canada.

This year I have the honour of being invited to perform at the 8th Annual Fire Dance Expo in San Francisco, and I need your help to get there. I am one of only two Canadian male solo fire spinners invited to perform this year. As an Indigenous artist I am proud to represent Canada and our Indigenous people. I hope you can help me make it there.  
What We Need & What You Get
Airfare: As of March 25th, return flights from Toronto to San Francisco for April 25th are approx $500. This is all I am asking for, help getting there and back.
The perks listed for this campaign come from my love for my art form. As a professional fire spinner I have a number of videos of my public performances and some promotional videos as well. Donations of $50 or more receive increasing video rewards and my sincere thanks.
If I do not reach my full funding goals, I will put whatever is raised towards the cost of airfare. Every little bit helps, so please give what you can.
The Impact
I grew up on a reservation in Northern Ontario called Constance Lake. When I was there I dreamed of seeing the world and of doing great things with my life. I have traveled Canada extensively and feel it is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Now is my chance to make my first ever journey out of Canada. It is also a chance to represent my people at a renowned fire event. I hope that this accomplishment will inspire the youth of my community, and other communities, to pursuit their dreams.
As a fire spinner I have put immeasurable hours of practice into my art form over the last 4 years. I love what I do and I am working hard to make it my living. Performing at the Union Square Fire Dance Expo would give me great exposure for my career. More importantly, it will give me the chance to do what I love for a crowd of 1000s on an international stage.

(Obviously, I like numbering.)1-Because you're tired of the overprocessed and recycled stories Hollywood is churning out that don't reflect any sort of reality you recognize AND you'd like to help bring alternative voices, specifically a Palestinian woman's narrative--a particularly fresh, sassy, and humorous one at that-- to the table.
2-Because without your support we won't be able to rent the theatre, print our postcards and posters, pay our lighting guy, rent rehearsal space, work with our director, make a new ASK A PALESTINIAN sign, etc etc. Essentially without this $5000 we will not be able to make the LA shows happen. 
3-Because you want one of the cool gifts in the sidebar.
Want to learn more about us? There are video clips of the show on our Youtube page and tons of info on our website. Thank you for your support and for reading this far! And please help us spread the word about the campaign. 
And no, we don't really know anyone from Hamas. But in case you're still scared, you can always donate anonymously ;)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Play</h3>
<p>OTHER PEOPLE tells the story of three ambitious young New Yorkers who struggle with sex, desir<span class=""text_exposed_show"">e
 and their art over Christmas in the East Village. Stephen is a 
frustrated ""blurb writer"" and aspiring playwright waiting to hear about a

returned from working as a stripper in Japan. Mark is Stephen's ex, a 
successful screenwriter fresh out of rehab, now a born again Christian 
crashing on Stephen and Petra's couch and struggling with his attraction 
to a mysterious young hustler named Tan. What ensues is a heartfelt and

<h3>Why do we want gas?</h3>
<p>Suitcase Shakespeare is driving into this fourth season of touring condensed physicalized Shakespeare.  Featuring maskwork, acrobatics, live music, dance, stage combat, and more, we combine physical theatre with classical theatre to create 'Theatre that Moves.'  We adapted a 5 actor, 55 minute production of Hamlet which opened last year in Chicago at the Den Theatre, featuring a blend of non verbal storytelling with some of the most famous poetry in the English language, accompanied by an original soundscape created by Arne Parrott, who also plays the title role.  Our Hamlet was just accepted into the Kansas City Fringe Festival, amidst 50 other acts from around the nation for five performances between July 19-29.  </p>
<p>Kansas City is over 500 miles from Chicago.  It is the farthest we've ever traveled, and for the longest stretch of time.  And gas prices are... eccentric at that moment.  </p>
<p>The set is built, the costumes are ready... we just need our dang cars to go.  Please help our cars (with us in them) get to Kansas City!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Some cool things if we get to go to Kansas City:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A new audience in a new state!  They get to see our work for the first time! </li>
<li>We get to share our work and network with artists from all over the country. </li>
<li>We can get reviewed. Professionally.</li>
<li>We can have access to schools and libraries in the area to bring our unique perspective of classical theatre to a new generation through school shows and workshops.  This fundraiser would help deduct those traveling expenses from the cost to the school or organization to host us.</li>
<li>We get to step away from our day jobs for two weeks to just do Suitcase and let our dream job BE our day job.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>We now need to get the $ to get us there: </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Gas and traveling (over half of this fundraiser is just for gas to get us there and back again.)</li>
<li>Fringe Festival fees</li>
<li>Publicity (so people in KC know we're coming!)</li>
<li>And anything left over goes to our actors, so they don't starve.  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What You Get for giving us gas. </h3>
<p>We have various gifts for filling our cars and our hearts with your support.</p>
<p>Please check out our gifts including a fun and Shakespearian voice mail greeting that will bump up the classiness of your voice mail inbox, and exclusive backstage footage of the show!  </p>
<p>For those special folks that dig deeper, we are creating a very limited number of specially handmade ""Patron of Honor"" favors, featuring swatches of fabric from some of our past productions. You can have a piece of our past for helping us with our future!  </p>

</div><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>In 2013, on a whim, I threw out an idea to the popular OC Comics Scene group on Facebook and the local internet immediately exploded with interest. My hands were forced and I created my first IndieGoGo campaign for the first Orange County Standup Awards. It went above and beyond my expectations and I don't see why we can't do that again. And again. Every year. Forever. <br/><br/>This year's event will be held on February 26th at STAGEStheatre in Fullerton, CA<br/><br/>What the award show actually is:</p><ul>
<li>A party disguised as a roast disguised as a classy award show! Nobody will be crowned ""Funniest Comic"" because that's not what this show is. There will be occasional genuine moments of praise, but primarily, these are categories you wouldn't want to be nominated for. </li>
<li>Comedians from all over Orange County and beyond will descend upon STAGEStheater in Fullerton. They will be greeted by a red carpet, photographers, media, a host, an announcer, trophies, a trophy lady, a slide show with fancy graphics, a keynote speech and catering! And more, probably!</li>
<li>Tuxedos and fancy dresses are not required, but highly encouraged. Don't be a schlub! </li>
<li>Comedians will know that they have been nominated, but will not know for what category until they're in the theater and the show is rolling. </li>
<li>The night's theme, as with last year, ""We Family!""</li>
</ul><p><b></b></p><h3><b><br/></b></h3><b>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3></b><p></p><p>If you're a local comic, that's great that you want to present or are hoping to get nominated. But we're not planning anything unless we know for sure that you will be there. And money is the most persuasive and articulate form of RSVP. </p><p>Here's how it all breaks down:</p><ul>
<li>Bare minimum to make this work is $400 (theater, staff, awards &amp; photography) but there is no reason to stop there. </li>
<li>An additional $200 gets us free Thundergoat Tacos for the entire night. </li>
<li>Indiegogo &amp; Paypal want about $50 total. (Obviously more if we make more.)</li>
<li>The more funding, the more outlandish this event gets.</li>
<li>$12 Pre-Sale Tickets get you in the door. If you are a local Orange County standup comic, we'll consider you to present and/or ""win"" - if we think it fits. We just need the pre-sale to at least know you're coming. </li>
<li>$14 tickets will be available at the box office the night of the event. We'll be glad to see you. We'll likely talk about you. You won't present or ""win"" anything. </li>
<li>$25 Pre-Sale Tickets get you and a +1 into the event. You are also automatically guaranteed a Technical Achievement Award which will be handed out at the top of the show, in a category that roastfully fits you. Additionally, you will be eligible to ""win"" in other categories as well as present - because we know you will be there. If your +1 is another Orange County comic, they will gain entry, but no personalized Technical Achievement Award.</li>
<li>Own a business? $75 gets you add space on our red carpet photography backdrop! </li>
</ul><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Impact</h3><p>There is no charity attached to this event, but...:</p><ul>
<li>It will be heavily photographed. Fancy dressed comics holding awards (fake as they may be) all hanging out with each other having a great time will not only raise awareness of our scene but perhaps bring us together?</li>
<li>Recent new year resolution comics won't have to wait so long at open mics.</li>
<li>""Winners"" can totally use their award credit in their show fliers!</li>
<li>Most importantly of all, we will be handing out the prestigious Johnnie Flowers Lifetime Achievement Award to an individual who has made an amazing impact in the local comedy community.</li>
</ul><h3><br/></h3><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Share this event with other local comedians. <br/><br/>Admittedly, this is event is pretty ""inside baseball"", so I can't imagine anybody outside our festering scene giving a damn about all this.

What We Need & What You GetIf you're a local comic, that's great that you want to present or are hoping to get nominated. But we're not planning anything unless we know for sure that you will be there. And money is the most persuasive and articulate form of RSVP. Here's how it all breaks down:

Recent new year resolution comics won't have to wait so long at open mics.

Most importantly of all, we will be handing out the prestigious Johnnie Flowers Lifetime Achievement Award to an individual who has made an amazing impact in the local comedy community.

<p>Hello, <br/></p>
<p>My name is Paul Lim and I am writing on behalf of our long awaited<i> 2013 Gracias Choir Christmas Cantata.</i><br/></p>
<p>Gracias Christmas Cantata is a show-stopping musical event that has 
touched the lives of people in over 40 countries around the world for 
the past 13 years. Gracias Christmas Cantata has been performed in 
venues like the Sydney Opera House, the Masonic of Detroit, and Madison 
Square Garden and in front of presidents, mayors, national ministries, 
and other prominent individuals. This show has really touched a lot of 
citizens here in Motor City and your donation is greatly needed at this time. The 
recession as well as the Auto Industry and the news of bankruptcy, has caused many citizens to lose
 hope, devastation to many homes in almost every where they turn. Tickets for this show 
generally run for $100 but seating for this show has always been free, 
<b>YES FREE SEATING!</b> Why do you ask are we doing this with nothing in 
return? Are mission has always been the same; to bring hope, joy and happiness back to the people of Detroit. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The intent of the Gracias Choir Christmas Cantata is
 to deliver the message of change and encouragement in their hearts to the youth and families of 
Metropolitan Detroit. We aim to bring the community together to witness a
 global phenomenon; the <i>Gracias Choir Christmas Cantata.</i> <b>Your helpful donation</b> <b>will solely be used for the purpose of Theatre rental, equipment rental, preparation, and food. </b></p>
<p>It’s no secret we love the holiday season. It represents a time when 
our homes are brighter and more colorful from all the beautiful 
decorations in our homes and the beautiful smiles on our faces. At 
Christmas, we long to fill our hearts with thankfulness and love through
 the time we spend with our families and the exchange of gifts and joy. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>With 3 beautiful music-filled stages (Birth, Happiness, and Glory), 
and 1 eternal message of hope, Gracias Christmas Cantata instills in its
 audiences the true meaning of Christmas: the birth of hope, love, and 
God’s forgiveness in each and every one of our hearts. Please visit <a href=""http://www.iyfusa.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.iyfusa.org</a> for more information.</p>

We now aim to legally incorporate and broaden the scope of our offerings

<p>The Classical Theatre Company (CTC), founded in Houston in 2007, is the only professional theatre company in the State of Texas that produces year round classical drama.  Due to the unwavering popularity of the classics both regionally and worldwide, CTC recognizes and fills a distinct niche in the Houston arts community.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>The Classical Theatre Company is dedicated to boldly re-envisioning classical drama on the stage, in the community, and in the classroom through engaging and enlightening plays - bringing them new life and relevance while maintaining the integrity that the works deserve.</p>
<p><strong>The Skinny...</strong></p>
<p>Classical Theatre Company needs some funds to get our ninth season moving. Funds are always harder to come by early in our season, and so this campaign will help us get our first production off the ground, help us to continue renovation on our facility and ensure that our Shakespeare Outreach program will continue to provide high quality programming by bringing Shakespeare out to the underserved schools, community centers, and population of Houston, as well as expand to meet the needs of our new Junior Acting Company.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>Some seed money to help us begin funding the first production of the 2016-2017 Mainstage Season - <i>The Bear &amp; The Proposal</i> by Anton Chekhov. This production will cost approximately $30,000, and since only a portion of those costs will be covered by ticket sales, the balance will need to be raised from other sources.</p>

Following the exciting and surprising Seahawks Super Bowl victory, Macklemore dominating the Grammys, and impressive social policy measures it's time to ask what can we do as a community to continue this great surge of city pride, community and collaboration. In this spirit, a group of almost 20 theatre companies has joined forces to produce an unprecedented festival. Featuring productions from the largest of companies in town to the smallest, and the words of the most important playwright of the 20th century, we came up with a celebration of Samuel Beckett spanning August through November.</p><p>The opportunity for a community that’s already pretty tight knit to come together on a city wide scale and have a conversation about a single writer we all love is a rare opportunity. Beckett gets it...he gets what it is like to be human and struggle through the human condition, and say it to and for the common man. He unites us all in our common angst of what it is like to be human and survive as a human in human society.<br/></p><p>We will feature not only the plays (such as <i>Waiting for Godot, Endgame, Krapps Last Tape, Act Without Words parts I &amp; II, </i>etc), but also readings of his poetry and prose, screenings of his films, master classes on Beckett, pop-up performance events, presentations of the radio plays, and much, much more.</p><p><b>Seattle Beckett Festival is a sponsored program of TPS.</b><br/></p><p>The Collaborators on this project include: </p><p>Seattle Shakespeare Company (<i>Waiting for Godot</i>)</p><p>West of Lenin (<i>Rockaby, Act Without Words, </i><i><i>La Dernière Bande [</i>Krapp's Last Tape</i> performed in French])</p><p>Sound Theatre Company</p><p>ACT Theatre (hosting Seattle Shakespeare Company, UMO Ensemble, Endangered Species Project)</p><p>Northwest Film Forum (Films of Beckett)</p><p>UMO Ensemble</p><p>Arts on the Waterfront</p><p>Book-It Theatre</p><p>New Century Theatre Company</p><p>Theatre Influence</p><p>Seattle University</p><p>Cornish College</p><p>Endangered Species Project</p><p>Sandbox Radio (<i>All That Fall, Words and Music</i>)</p><p>Eclectic (<i>Play</i>)</p><p>Ghost Light Theatricals (<i>Endgame</i>)</p><p>Azeotrope</p><p>ReAct</p><p>... and more!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Due to the unparalleled nature of this collaboration, we as a collective of theatre companies are seeking a sum of $20,000 to fund this festival. This money will be used to build the infrastructure around the festival, as we are aiming for a collective presentation of the works, yet within the normal season structure of the companies involved. This includes:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Campagin through local magazines, newspapers, radio and television.</li>
<li>Creation and upkeep of website.</li>
<li>Creation and distribution of maps and punch cards for repeat visitors</li>

Following the exciting and surprising Seahawks Super Bowl victory, Macklemore dominating the Grammys, and impressive social policy measures it's time to ask what can we do as a community to continue this great surge of city pride, community and collaboration. In this spirit, a group of almost 20 theatre companies has joined forces to produce an unprecedented festival. Featuring productions from the largest of companies in town to the smallest, and the words of the most important playwright of the 20th century, we came up with a celebration of Samuel Beckett spanning August through November.The opportunity for a community that’s already pretty tight knit to come together on a city wide scale and have a conversation about a single writer we all love is a rare opportunity. Beckett gets it...he gets what it is like to be human and struggle through the human condition, and say it to and for the common man. He unites us all in our common angst of what it is like to be human and survive as a human in human society.We will feature not only the plays (such as Waiting for Godot, Endgame, Krapps Last Tape, Act Without Words parts I & II, etc), but also readings of his poetry and prose, screenings of his films, master classes on Beckett, pop-up performance events, presentations of the radio plays, and much, much more.Seattle Beckett Festival is a sponsored program of TPS.The Collaborators on this project include: Seattle Shakespeare Company (Waiting for Godot)West of Lenin (Rockaby, Act Without Words, La Dernière Bande [Krapp's Last Tape performed in French])Sound Theatre CompanyACT Theatre (hosting Seattle Shakespeare Company, UMO Ensemble, Endangered Species Project)Northwest Film Forum (Films of Beckett)UMO EnsembleArts on the WaterfrontBook-It TheatreNew Century Theatre CompanyTheatre InfluenceSeattle UniversityCornish CollegeEndangered Species ProjectSandbox Radio (All That Fall, Words and Music)Eclectic (Play)Ghost Light Theatricals (Endgame)AzeotropeReAct... and more!What We Need & What You GetDue to the unparalleled nature of this collaboration, we as a collective of theatre companies are seeking a sum of $20,000 to fund this festival. This money will be used to build the infrastructure around the festival, as we are aiming for a collective presentation of the works, yet within the normal season structure of the companies involved. This includes:
Campagin through local magazines, newspapers, radio and television.
Creation and upkeep of website.
Creation and distribution of maps and punch cards for repeat visitors
Possible inclusion of some exciting guests.
Generation of awareness of the festival through collateral. 
In return, you, the audience member, will be able to see many different takes on the work of perhaps the only playwright that can bring together as diverse a selection of companies as are listed above.Samuel Beckett Bio and notable worksSamuel Barclay Beckett (13 April 1906 – 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, and poet, who l wrote in both English and French.

Captain's Log
The first play I wrote, Chicken, was first performed at the Southwark Playhouse and I have since adapted the story for screen. Chicken, the feature film, recently won the Grand Jury Prize at New Hampshire Film Festival after premiering at the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2015. 
In recent years I also wrote and performed Winston on the Run, a one-man show about the young Winston Churchill, which toured to over 30 venues nationwide and played at a handful of UK festivals.
My latest play is a comedy - the first I have ever written - and presenting it at the Vault Festival is not only a great way to see the play produced but also to catch the attention of some important producers and directors in London.   Pounds, shillings, and pence The funding I am seeking to raise with this campaign will go specifically towards ensuring that the play has an audience whilst it is at the festival and also documenting it to ensure it will have a future life, as well as contribute as much as possible to the careers of the artists involved.

<p><b>Maighread Southard-Wray (Cellist) </b>- has been playing Cello in Pittsburgh for the past ten years. She has recently performed at St Andrew's Episcopal church in Highland Park, where she is Head Chorister and is a member of the parish choir. Also a local actor, Maighread just performed in Prime Stage’s The Crucible, as Mary Warren, along with Joanna Lowe.</p>
<p>Maighread is delighted to be working with Cup-A-Jo Productions for the first time, and looks forward to the challenge of pairing cello with a modern adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters.</p></span>
</div>
<div>
<b>Joanna Lowe (Artistic Director/ Marcia Prior) </b>- founded Cup-A-Jo Productions in 2004 with the idea that she could do anything with the talent and resources around her in Pittsburgh - over the years, it's only proved more and more possible; her greatest hope is to continue making excellent art in and supported by Pittsburgh with Pittsburgh artists. In her lack of spare time, she raises an incredible daughter, is one of the premiere spoken word artists in the city, directs, teaches and writes. </div>
<div>
<b>Gayle Pazerski (Olga Prior) </b>- is honored to have the opportunity to share the humanity of The Sisters with so many gifted artists. Having performed in The Three Sisters as a college student, she is eager to revisit the story with 15 extra years of (wonderful, terrible, hilarious, tragic) life to her credit. </div>
<div>
<b>Jenny Malarkey (Irene Prior) </b>- ""As well as an actor, I am also a teacher. I teach in a unique program called Creative Dramatics through The Pittsburgh Public Theatre. This program focuses on pairing a city school with a suburban school, and brings together two completely different groups of students- racially, economically, socially, etc... We first meet with each school individually as we play games and do activities that help build confidence, creativity, teamwork, etc... Then both schools are brought together, and through the art of storytelling, they discover they are able to overcome their differences and find they might not actually be that different at all. At the end of our time with them, the students put on an abridged version of a Shakespeare play, and get to perform it for their friends and family in the bigO'Reilly theatre. This program continually shows me why the arts are such a vital part of our schools. It reminds us to think, and feel, and open our arms to those seemingly different than us. Even as we get older, I find these skills are just as important. So, I greatly look forward to getting the chance to work with old friends and new as we begin this crazy adventure together.""</div>
<div>
<b>Stanley Graham (Andrew Prior) </b>- A Pittsburgh native born in Carrick studied theatre first at CCAC South Campus for two years before his acceptance into COPA at Point Park University. A recent graduate of the program with his B.F.A in Musical Theatre, Stanley was able to have plenty of performance opportunities at the university and throughout the Pittsburgh area. Stanley is so exited to be working with this company on a modern telling of the great Chekov Classic.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Jessie Goodman (Nancy Pecket) - </b>was
raised in Pittsburgh and has been going to plays, concerts, and other local
cultural events since she was a little girl. Inspired to cultivate the art of
live performance and encourage audiences to reflect on the human experience,
Jessie received her BFA in Acting from Shenandoah Conservatory in Virginia. She
is interested in promoting the multifaceted woman in her work, specifically
when it comes to breaking gender roles and looks stereotypes. After going to
New York for a stint, Jessie is thankful to be back in the secure city of
Pittsburgh. She is now pursuing her Master’s in social work at the University
of Pittsburgh in order to help people on and off the stage more effectively. As
a member of Pittsburgh Playback Theatre, Jessie is excited to open up dialogues
within the community on difficult issues and allow people to watch their
stories come to life on the spot. Jessie plans to bring more gripping,
challenging plays to Pittsburgh and will find a way to get them out to diverse
groups of people. </div>
<div>
<b>Everett Lowe (Gary Sokol) </b>- Everett believes in the transformative power of the arts—they’re still changing him for the better. A collaborator at heart, Everett thrives—both as an actor and director—wherever passionate artists come together under a united vision. He’s always looking for a new challenge. Everett absolutely loves Pittsburgh and the diverse community making this city what it is.</div>
<div>
<b>Jason Spider Matthews (Vincent Antonelli) </b>- is an actor, director, and teacher originally from Washington DC, trained here in Pittsburgh at Point Park University, and then went to NYC to spread his wings.  Now back in the Burgh' he is happy to be a part of this production.</div>
<div>
<b>Samantha A. Camp (Nurse/Paramedic) </b>- Samantha’s recent credits include: Mrs. Frank in <i>The Diary of Anne Frank</i>, Julie in <i>A Delicate Balance</i>, Clytemnestra in <i>Agamemnon</i> and Amanda Wingfield in <i>The Glass Menagerie</i>. Those roles all were super line-heavy - not allowing Samantha to indulge in one of her absolute favorite activities: backstage knitting. She would like to thank Joanna and Art for giving her the opportunity to get the last few hundred rows of that blasted sweater done. She was twice named Best Actress in a Drama (once a tie) by the Tacoma News-Tribune (for Artie in <i>Eleemosynary</i> and Tamora in <i>Titus Andronicus</i>). Samantha recently moved back to Pittsburgh after 12 years on the Other Coast. <i>The Sisters</i> is her 145th show as an actress (and counting). Check out <a href=""http://www.samanthacamp.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.samanthacamp.net</a> or become her fan on Facebook. Thanks, as always, to The Bruce for pomegranates.</div>
<div>
<b>Michael Petyak (Fight Choreographer) </b>- Petyak's stage credits include work at the ""Dickens of a Christmas"" at the Crosley Theatre in Sarasota, Florida, Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, Great Plains Theatre (Abilene, KS), Between Us Productions (NYC), Bob Junior in Who’s Bob Friendly? at the Pittsburgh Fringe Festival, and just directed Sweet Tea and Cadillacs for the Pittsburgh New Works Festival. When he is not doing stage, Michael is a professional stunt man/actor that recently worked on the new series “Outsiders” in Pittsburgh where he doubled Joe Anderson, and also Calum Worthy in the upcoming feature film, Repicate. He received his BFA in Music Theatre, Magna Cum Laude from Shenandoah University in 2012. He is a proud member of SAG-AFTRA.</div>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHAT WE NEED</span></h3>
<div><b>A SPACE: </b></div>
<div>""A man walks across an empty space whilst someone else is watching him, and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged."" - Peter Brooks<br/>
</div>
<div>Cup-A-Jo Productions has performed in all manner of spaces, traditional and non, whether chosen for the production or whether we've had to make a challenging space work to fulfill our goal. This time, we've chosen the location specifically to enhance the play and the audience experience.</div>
<div>
<i>The Sisters, </i>set in an ivy league university, will be mounted in the Carnegie Free Library in Carnegie, a beautiful historic landmark; our production will take place specifically in the Lincoln Gallery, surrounded by rare Lincoln photographs. It calls to mind a classic era appropriate to Chekhov as well as implying the educational atmosphere of the play itself. </div>
<div>The majority of the money raised will be used to finance access to our unique space, because as Peter Brooks has said, that is really all that we need.</div>
<div>
<b>PAY:</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Being an artist is hard. We do what we do for the love of it. Love, however, rarely if ever pays the bills and we'd love to show our collaboration of artists that they are worth more than their efforts by giving them something tangible as appreciation. We need your help to do that. <br/>
</div>
<div><b>ENVIRONS:</b></div>
<div>Eloquence is the final touch. First, we get a space. Next, we support our artists. Then, we add the flourish. The final touch to make your experience unforgettable, to make your senses tingle, your heart pound, your mind spin. As we said, this is a production with live music, wine, and fists. Aren't you curious?</div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">HOW YOU'RE HELPING</span></h3>
<div>You are supporting Pittsburgh artists. You are saying ""yes"" to experimental art. You are aiding in presenting challenging ideas and explorations. You are encouraging a theatre company that strives to execute unique and excellent work. You are helping Pittsburgh continue to be a city that fosters and thrives on art. We need you. </div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">OTHER WAYS TO HELP</span></h3>
<div>We understand as artists (sometimes the starving variety) that money doesn't grow on trees and sometimes it's all one can do to afford a full tank of gas. Trust us, we've all been there. Even so, there's a lot you can do to help us:</div>
<div>* <b>share our campaign</b> on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, e-mail, snail mail, telepathy and smoke signal. You get the idea. Help us spread the word.</div>
<div>* <b>attend our fundraiser</b> at Hambones on December 18th from 7-9pm where you'll get to see our cast and crew entertain you and each other. Proceeds also benefit Toys for Tots because we recognize that there are always people in greater need.</div>
<div>* <b>come and see the show</b>. It's going to be amazing. We want to share it with you.<br/>

He recently completed his 105th acting role at Little Lake Theatre Company, his “home base”, where he has been a part of over 143 productions and serves as a Board member and instructor. A 2007 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Performer of the Year, Art is also an active voice-over artist in both the US and Canada. He is looking forward to his first project with Cup-A-Jo Productions and excited about working on this contemporary adaptation and the challenge of working in a non-traditional setting.

Maighread Southard-Wray (Cellist) - has been playing Cello in Pittsburgh for the past ten years. She has recently performed at St Andrew's Episcopal church in Highland Park, where she is Head Chorister and is a member of the parish choir. Also a local actor, Maighread just performed in Prime Stage’s The Crucible, as Mary Warren, along with Joanna Lowe.
Maighread is delighted to be working with Cup-A-Jo Productions for the first time, and looks forward to the challenge of pairing cello with a modern adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters.


Joanna Lowe (Artistic Director/ Marcia Prior) - founded Cup-A-Jo Productions in 2004 with the idea that she could do anything with the talent and resources around her in Pittsburgh - over the years, it's only proved more and more possible; her greatest hope is to continue making excellent art in and supported by Pittsburgh with Pittsburgh artists. In her lack of spare time, she raises an incredible daughter, is one of the premiere spoken word artists in the city, directs, teaches and writes. 

Gayle Pazerski (Olga Prior) - is honored to have the opportunity to share the humanity of The Sisters with so many gifted artists. Having performed in The Three Sisters as a college student, she is eager to revisit the story with 15 extra years of (wonderful, terrible, hilarious, tragic) life to her credit. 

Jenny Malarkey (Irene Prior) - ""As well as an actor, I am also a teacher. I teach in a unique program called Creative Dramatics through The Pittsburgh Public Theatre. This program focuses on pairing a city school with a suburban school, and brings together two completely different groups of students- racially, economically, socially, etc... We first meet with each school individually as we play games and do activities that help build confidence, creativity, teamwork, etc... Then both schools are brought together, and through the art of storytelling, they discover they are able to overcome their differences and find they might not actually be that different at all. At the end of our time with them, the students put on an abridged version of a Shakespeare play, and get to perform it for their friends and family in the bigO'Reilly theatre. This program continually shows me why the arts are such a vital part of our schools. It reminds us to think, and feel, and open our arms to those seemingly different than us. Even as we get older, I find these skills are just as important. So, I greatly look forward to getting the chance to work with old friends and new as we begin this crazy adventure together.""

Stanley Graham (Andrew Prior) - A Pittsburgh native born in Carrick studied theatre first at CCAC South Campus for two years before his acceptance into COPA at Point Park University. A recent graduate of the program with his B.F.A in Musical Theatre, Stanley was able to have plenty of performance opportunities at the university and throughout the Pittsburgh area. Stanley is so exited to be working with this company on a modern telling of the great Chekov Classic.


Jessie Goodman (Nancy Pecket) - was
raised in Pittsburgh and has been going to plays, concerts, and other local
cultural events since she was a little girl. Inspired to cultivate the art of
live performance and encourage audiences to reflect on the human experience,
Jessie received her BFA in Acting from Shenandoah Conservatory in Virginia. She
is interested in promoting the multifaceted woman in her work, specifically
when it comes to breaking gender roles and looks stereotypes. After going to
New York for a stint, Jessie is thankful to be back in the secure city of
Pittsburgh. She is now pursuing her Master’s in social work at the University
of Pittsburgh in order to help people on and off the stage more effectively. As
a member of Pittsburgh Playback Theatre, Jessie is excited to open up dialogues
within the community on difficult issues and allow people to watch their
stories come to life on the spot. Jessie plans to bring more gripping,
challenging plays to Pittsburgh and will find a way to get them out to diverse
groups of people. 

Everett Lowe (Gary Sokol) - Everett believes in the transformative power of the arts—they’re still changing him for the better. A collaborator at heart, Everett thrives—both as an actor and director—wherever passionate artists come together under a united vision. He’s always looking for a new challenge. Everett absolutely loves Pittsburgh and the diverse community making this city what it is.

Jason Spider Matthews (Vincent Antonelli) - is an actor, director, and teacher originally from Washington DC, trained here in Pittsburgh at Point Park University, and then went to NYC to spread his wings.  Now back in the Burgh' he is happy to be a part of this production.

Samantha A. Camp (Nurse/Paramedic) - Samantha’s recent credits include: Mrs. Frank in The Diary of Anne Frank, Julie in A Delicate Balance, Clytemnestra in Agamemnon and Amanda Wingfield in The Glass Menagerie. Those roles all were super line-heavy - not allowing Samantha to indulge in one of her absolute favorite activities: backstage knitting. She would like to thank Joanna and Art for giving her the opportunity to get the last few hundred rows of that blasted sweater done. She was twice named Best Actress in a Drama (once a tie) by the Tacoma News-Tribune (for Artie in Eleemosynary and Tamora in Titus Andronicus). Samantha recently moved back to Pittsburgh after 12 years on the Other Coast. The Sisters is her 145th show as an actress (and counting). Check out www.samanthacamp.net or become her fan on Facebook. Thanks, as always, to The Bruce for pomegranates.

Michael Petyak (Fight Choreographer) - Petyak's stage credits include work at the ""Dickens of a Christmas"" at the Crosley Theatre in Sarasota, Florida, Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, Great Plains Theatre (Abilene, KS), Between Us Productions (NYC), Bob Junior in Who’s Bob Friendly? at the Pittsburgh Fringe Festival, and just directed Sweet Tea and Cadillacs for the Pittsburgh New Works Festival. When he is not doing stage, Michael is a professional stunt man/actor that recently worked on the new series “Outsiders” in Pittsburgh where he doubled Joe Anderson, and also Calum Worthy in the upcoming feature film, Repicate. He received his BFA in Music Theatre, Magna Cum Laude from Shenandoah University in 2012. He is a proud member of SAG-AFTRA.

WHAT WE NEED
A SPACE: 
""A man walks across an empty space whilst someone else is watching him, and this is all that is needed for an act of theatre to be engaged."" - Peter Brooks

Cup-A-Jo Productions has performed in all manner of spaces, traditional and non, whether chosen for the production or whether we've had to make a challenging space work to fulfill our goal. This time, we've chosen the location specifically to enhance the play and the audience experience.

The Sisters, set in an ivy league university, will be mounted in the Carnegie Free Library in Carnegie, a beautiful historic landmark; our production will take place specifically in the Lincoln Gallery, surrounded by rare Lincoln photographs. It calls to mind a classic era appropriate to Chekhov as well as implying the educational atmosphere of the play itself. 
The majority of the money raised will be used to finance access to our unique space, because as Peter Brooks has said, that is really all that we need.

PAY:

Being an artist is hard. We do what we do for the love of it. Love, however, rarely if ever pays the bills and we'd love to show our collaboration of artists that they are worth more than their efforts by giving them something tangible as appreciation. We need your help to do that. 

ENVIRONS:
Eloquence is the final touch. First, we get a space. Next, we support our artists. Then, we add the flourish. The final touch to make your experience unforgettable, to make your senses tingle, your heart pound, your mind spin. As we said, this is a production with live music, wine, and fists. Aren't you curious?
HOW YOU'RE HELPING
You are supporting Pittsburgh artists. You are saying ""yes"" to experimental art. You are aiding in presenting challenging ideas and explorations. You are encouraging a theatre company that strives to execute unique and excellent work. You are helping Pittsburgh continue to be a city that fosters and thrives on art. We need you. 
OTHER WAYS TO HELP
We understand as artists (sometimes the starving variety) that money doesn't grow on trees and sometimes it's all one can do to afford a full tank of gas. Trust us, we've all been there. Even so, there's a lot you can do to help us:
* share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, e-mail, snail mail, telepathy and smoke signal. You get the idea. Help us spread the word.
* attend our fundraiser at Hambones on December 18th from 7-9pm where you'll get to see our cast and crew entertain you and each other. Proceeds also benefit Toys for Tots because we recognize that there are always people in greater need.
* come and see the show. It's going to be amazing. We want to share it with you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution helps in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports an evening of engaging, physical, investigative expression that will touch every single audience member. Dance is an ephemeral, 3-D form, and the emotional arc and in-the-moment magic is not easily captured on video. We have high ambitions for this evening. To piggy-back on that, <i>Any Offered None </i>has already proven itself to be a piece of emotional force. Eve and the dancers still (a year after it's debut) hear feedback from people who were transported, who had cathartic experiences, who deeply hope to see it again.</li>
<li>Provides financial compensation to artists in a time when arts funding and education is arguably not at it's most vibrant.</li>

</div></div>","EXPERIMENT IN THREE PARTS
Experiment In Three Parts is an ongoing work in progress blending, exploring, and blurring the boundaries between music and how we move to it. Choreographed and directed by Rebecca Green, this work looks to the dancers as active intellectual participants and to the audience as active contributors.  We aim for quality, risk, relevance, specificity and relate-ability in this work.
 
Where Does Your Money Go?
$2500 - Payment for 4 dancers and 1 sound collaborator $2500 - Studio rental fees for Approx. 3 - 4 months of rehearsal.
Any money raised beyond our goal will go to documentation for the performance, staging, lighting, and costuming for the performers! 
​ 
The Impact
 
Your contribution not only helps us create this work, but also contributes to the art community.  By donating you make a statement that art is a valuable part of society and you send a message of optimism and potential to other up incoming artists who want to make and present work!  You say: opportunity does exist if you make it happen.  
 

Other Ways You Can Help
 
Every donation of any size helps us reach our goal, but just as important as donations is getting the word out about this campaign!  Please share this with your friends over Facebook, instagram, email and any other social media platform.  The more people we can reach, the better our chance of making this work a reality.

<h2>What is ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" Summary</h2>
<p>“He asked me all sorts of questions, pretending to be very loving and kind.”</p>
<p>The Yellow Wallpaper was first developed last year in a one-night-only run at Dixon Place on their MainStage. We are now remounting the piece in 2019 with a new perspective. Andrew Watkins' adaptation is a multimedia staging of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s searing indictment of the 19th century medical community. This new adaptation and multimedia staging provides an intimate look at a deteriorating mental state and how the world of medicine has and continually doubts women.</p>
<p>The cast will be led by Sam Morales* (Miranda in The Public Mobile Unit’s Tempest) and will also star Jacob Fishel* (Fiddler on the Roof and TFANA’s King Lear) and Lindsey Sagrera. The script will be adapted and directed by Andrew Watkins (Network, Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune). The production will feature sets by Vincent Gunn; costumes by Christopher Metzger; lighting by Dallas Estes; video by Cinthia Chen; original music and sound design by Sam Kaseta and stage managed by Katherine Bolynn*.</p>
<p>We are raising money for the IRT 3B Development series incarnation of this piece. Performances will run October 4th-13th (specific times and dates below). The producers are passionately contributing time, skills and resources to this project out of passion for the concept. However, they need your help compensating the brilliant artists involved.</p>
<p>We are functioning as an equity showcase. Your contributions will help you support talented artists in a grassroots theatre laboratory to produce a new and important incarnation of a historical piece of feminist literature. </p>

<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>Personnel in theatre are rarely compensated appropriately for their work. We are trying our best to compensate our artists. While we cannot put a price on their work, our budget is broken down by what we estimate that we can afford with your help. This includes our administrative team (Stage Manager), Technical Artists (Lighting, Video, Sound, Set, Costumes), skilled hands for load-in and load-out, board operators, etc. And not to mention, our very talented cast! </p>
<p>Other Expenses include the space rental for rehearsal, art and production materials (Lighting, Video, Sound, Set, Costumes) and marketing and promotion (graphic design and digital media) </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>We set out to find a project that would represent depression in a truthful and impactful way. We found that most explorations within similar plays were about the loved ones of a person suffering from depression, and not about the experience itself. Either that, or they were a depiction of violence and fear. The Yellow Wallpaper is a truthful expression of the suffering of mental illness.</p>
<p>This project had a successful developmental show at Dixon Place. We are returning with the project's original director, assistant director, producing team and lead actor. </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The immersive video is a huge endeavor for this group, as the technology involved in creating a multimedia piece is very expensive and temperamental. We have taken great care between our first staging of this piece and now to come up with a solution and develop a plan to realize our goals within our budget. However, even with our careful planning, we need your support.</p>

This April, I'm launching a new Queer variety show titled The Pansy Parlor. Premiering at The Triad Theater in New York City, it's an intimate evening of Drag, Burlesque, Comedy and more...produced by and for Queer Artists!<br/><br/>The Pansy Parlor isn't really a drag show, </span><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">nor is it burlesque. It's not strictly </span>comedy either! What it <i>is</i>, is a platform for Queer, Trans, AFAB and Non-Conforming performers of all disciplines to express themselves. Hosted by drag queens Caia Campbell and Zenadia Mars, it's a positively peculiar evening broadcast live from the Queer imagination. <br/><br/>Unlike traditional Queer nightlife, The Pansy Parlor is a true variety show, giving equal time for all artists. Sometimes drag queens get all the love. It's not fair, but it's true. At The Pansy Parlor, we're featuring drag queens, kings, burlesque performers, comedians, puppeteers, musicians and more! All performers are valid and deserve to be celebrated! Our goal is to foster creative risk taking, community, and appreciation for these art forms...art forms that have been around for 100s of years.</font></p>
<h3>The Pansy What? </h3>
<p><font>The show takes inspiration from ""The Pansy Craze"" of the 1930s, but what does that mean?</font><br/>I'm glad you asked!</p>
<p>Let’s imagine. It’s 1930 and Prohibition's in full swing. People and cultures are mixing like never before, in search of a good time. These changing times meant, for the first time, <i>Queer</i> culture was seen and celebrated on a widespread scale!</p>
<p>LGBTQ artists and entertainers found unheard of commercial success. Entertainers such as Rae Bourbon, Gladys Bentley, and Karyl Norman performed to sold out audiences across the US. Yet, as quickly as this Queer subculture rose to prominence, it was ushered underground at the end of the 1930s.</p>
<h3>Why Now? </h3>
<p>Today we express ourselves much more freely. Yet, outside of television, Queer performance art is still relatively underground. </p>
<p>Amazing artists perform in venues without stages, dressing rooms, or even proper lighting...right here in New York City. Frankly, this lack of production value is disheartening! We've created The Pansy Parlor to honor the rich history of these art forms and provide an immersive theatrical experience that artists and audiences deserve. </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Independent artists and producers in NYC face many challenges. Production, creation, and performance are investments of time, energy, and funds. We need contributors like you to ensure The Pansy Parlor is a success! Here's where that money goes: </p>

During college and the year after college I was the producer and choreographer of my own dance company. In 2012, I moved to the East Bay area of California where I have been since, writing songs and performing with my solo song writing project, producing house concerts, and being an active part of the East Bay Contact Improvisation dance community.</p><p>In the summer of 2017, I started my own small business teaching people how to sing. I got back into theater in the summer of 2019, began performing drag in the fall of 2019, and in the winter of 2020 performed the role of Laura in the Glass Menagerie with the Ross Valley Players in Marin County. During Covid this past year, I decided to go for it and make my performing dreams come alive and applied to MFA in acting programs.</p><p> </p><p>My Vision:</p><p>Now more than ever we need artists in the world who are committed to helping our human and environmental situations which are in dire straits. The role of the artist in society is to hold up a mirror and show people who live in that society the inhuman and harsh behaviors that are the ""norm"" so are not able to be seen. This mirror provides a necessary perspective that is vital for the survival of the human spirit, and the survival of humans on this planet.</p><p>If one theater artist is funded, her work in the world will have a ripple effect by nature of the work itself; the work of the theater artist is by its nature in community, so she will naturally inspire and uplift those around her if she herself is uplifted and supported.</p><p> </p><p>Briefly describe your campaign and why it’s important to you:</p><p>My campaign involves raising money to help me pay for graduate school.

This will help me be to able to be more successful as an artist when I leave school and go out into the world of creating life and world changing theater performances.  </p><p>Being able to focus 100% on this MFA program without needing to take out as much loan money to pay for school would make a huge difference in my peace of mind and also in my effectiveness as a graduate student in theater. The theater arts are already a challenging field in which to embark on a new career, so I figured that having additional financial support would help me realize my goals of bringing meaningful, fun, and world changing theater into existence in my post graduate career.</p><p> </p><p>What I need and what you get:</p><p>My goal is to raise a minimum of $8,400 and a maximum of $26,400. The $8,400 minimum would cover the additional cost of living expenses for the year not covered by loans (which is about $1,500/mo), as well paying for the interest on my loans which is $179/mo. The maximum of $26,400 would cover the total cost of living expenses so that I don't have to use any loan money to live on, and I will have $12,000 less in debt to pay off after I graduate, as well as cover the payment of interest ($179/mo).</p><p><br/>Risks and challenges:</p><p>This is perhaps the most risky and yet the most important step I have made yet in my life. I am willing to completely embody the role of a theater artist and trust that stepping into it will make me feel fully alive and will open doorways, allowing me to grow personally, as an artist, and as a member of a society that needs deep healing.</p><p>As you may be well aware, choosing a path of an artist, especially a theater artist, is probably one of the most financially risky decisions a person can make. This is not a lucrative art form, and everyone who goes into this field knows that they are stepping into a extremely competitive world. This requires audacity, drive, motivation, and a deep love and passion for one’s art.</p><p>I am qualified for these risks and challenges because I have been making a living as a musician and a performer for many years. Most recently, I ran my own business as a vocal instructor, and was a successful business owner connecting people to their bodies, their creativity, and their voices. Even during the pandemic on zoom!</p><p>My plan for solving the challenges of becoming a post graduate theater artist, is to do the thing I have always done in order to survive and thrive in my art: to continue to connect with people and form meaningful and lasting relationships that are based upon trust and mutual respect. After many years of figuring out how to make a living as an artist, I know that building lasting, trusting relationships is the core and the key to a successful and meaningful career.</p><p><br/>Otherwise you can help:</p><p>If you can’t contribute money, you can help me in other ways!

Even during the pandemic on zoom!My plan for solving the challenges of becoming a post graduate theater artist, is to do the thing I have always done in order to survive and thrive in my art: to continue to connect with people and form meaningful and lasting relationships that are based upon trust and mutual respect. After many years of figuring out how to make a living as an artist, I know that building lasting, trusting relationships is the core and the key to a successful and meaningful career.Otherwise you can help:If you can’t contribute money, you can help me in other ways! You can tell your friends and family about my campaign, and you can also become an audience member of my work. Artists and performers of all kinds need faithful audience members who care about their work. This is just as important as a financial contribution.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We'd like to keep from having to charge admission for as long as we can.</p><p>PWR is also now a 80-person organization putting on one of the largest free events in Texas. Increased expectations beget increased (and wholly worthwhile) costs: we spend north of $10,000 on each of our shows.</p><p>We diligently budget and carefully save so that we can ask for an amount that is sustainable. We are continuously able to improve the show and make it grander; our rigorous planning -- combined with your support -- have allowed us to do this without our costs ballooning to a hellish degree!

We've survived more than five years as we've grown into the massive wrestling party you know today—and we're not slowing down! Accept no impostors! HELL RIGHT</p><p>Some of the cool things your donations will help us do include:</p><ul>
<li><p>Art and design. We have an extremely talented team of designers who transform the venue into an art piece by using garbage. 4th Tap was turned into a living Greek ruin at our last show! This time, we're recreating the systems of the human and inhuman body, and making them big enough to walk inside!

<li><p>Air Conditioning. The huge space we have the ring in isn't air conditioned, so we build our own cooling system for the summer shows! We rent swamp coolers and hoist them onto huge risers that we built. This, combined with about $700 worth of fans we've collected over the years and a clever air-pathing layout keep the ring area comfortable in the Summer!</p></li>
<li><p>Paying artists. We work hard to make sure everyone who contributes to our production gets some money in exchange—whether our art team, our powerful tech wizards, or our A/V crew.</p></li>
<li><p>Safer space/security: PWR is a party for everyone. Our performers have always followed anti-sexist/homophobic/transphobic/racist guidelines, and we wanted to make sure that comfort extends to our audience. We’re proud of our security phone line. Any member of the audience may use this number to report gross behavior at the show, and we resolve the problem. Your support lets us keep reaching toward a goal of ULTIMATE PARTY VIOLENCE for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Projection and lighting. PWR has some of the most advanced lighting for an independent wrestling show in the country! And we built it ourselves, with your help. We always have tweaks to make to reach towards our goal of TV-quality lighting. If you saw our lights at the last show, you know how shockingly powerful our latest generation is! Also, our projection system allows people to watch the show from 3 different places in the venue, each with different sitting and standing options! Plus, we now STREAM our shows over twitch, and your support helps us improve the quality of it</p></li>
<li><p>Training: Party Violence is its own unique sport. We have crafted a training program that makes use of experienced pro-wrestling coaching to help keep our PARTY ATHLETES smooth n' safe.  </p></li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are The Snortwhores: an alternative physical comedy collaboration based in Portland, OR, USA. Over the last two years we have been working together to dream up our project, Disaster Fantasy: an original airplane thriller in drag. The idea started with Emily experiencing recurring nightmares, and Jeff wanting to create a show based off of them, incorporating his newly discovered drag persona. The project was successfully approved for funding from the Regional Arts and Culture Council, and also an artist residency at Lookout Arts Quarry in Bellingham, WA. Like any successful theatre production, we are looking for producers! This will allow us to flesh out our World Premiere in our hometown, and further develop the show to bring to theatre festivals around the world. </p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Emily Newton</strong> has performed as original comedic characters all over the world. She has hosted events, toured two solo shows, and performed for Terrapin Puppet Theatre, Oregon Children’s Theatre, and Dell’Arte International. Reviewers have called her performances “comedic gold”, “a standout clown”, “complete and beautiful nonsense” and “a solo show that’s actually good”.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Desautels</strong> is a founding member of the comedic trio, Box of Clowns. He has toured to festivals all over North America, appeared on America’s Got Talent and The Gong Show, and has performed with Tears of Joy, CoHo Theatre, and is the Emcee of Sir Cupcake’s Queer Circus. His work has been praised as “infectiously joyful” and “A+ physical comedy”.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">New Wave Theater Collective was founded in April of 2016 by Sarah Wolff and Jenny Hickman. We believe that theater has the power to spark the discussion to create broader change. New Wave carefully selects timely, contemporary pieces that reflect this belief, and empowers emerging young artists by giving them a platform to produce their work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">NWTC has produced four MainStage productions, including <i>What We're Up Against</i> by Theresa Rebeck, <i>Constellations</i> by Nick Payne, <i>Bull </i>by Mike Bartlett and <i>The New Sincerity</i> by Alena Smith. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">New Wave New Works</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A year ago New Wave Theater Collective launched its New Wave New Works series. Once a month we meet and listen to a staged reading of a piece by one of our featured playwrights. The series has given writers the opportunity to hear their works-in-progress read out loud by actors in a supportive environment, at no cost to the playwright. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why produce new work?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mounting productions of new pieces is becoming increasingly challenging, as the cost of performances space and rehearsal studios in New York City is astronomical. Thus, the majority of the shows that have been produced on a large scale within the past few years have been more commercial. Producers tend to feel more comfortable monetarily backing an adaptation of a popular film, or backing a revival of a well-known play. In order for theater to evolve, new work must continue to be brought to the table. New Wave Theater Collective empowers the artists who are creating new pieces for new audiences. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This upcoming April, we will be launching our first WORLD PREMIERE of a play that we featured in the 2017 New Wave New Works series. Alec Silberblatt's ""The Angel of Allegheny County"" delighted our audience, and we are so excited to present his work as a fully realized production. </p>

<h3>THE STORY </h3>
<p>America, present. A pleasant suburb begins to form outside a major metropolitan city. Its residents are young, nice, and educated. They’re nothing like their parents— </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Save they don’t like when those kids enter their store. And should he really be dating our daughter? And who really is bringing drugs into our city? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>— So they decide to do something about it. Save they might go too far. And they may have been mistaken. Or they might have just been racist. And so a cycle of nightmarish violence begins… </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Utilizing (and subverting) the tradition of the Greek Chorus, HOUSE ON FIRE intermingles text, dance/movement, and art installation to probe the subtle violence of white supremacy, and the ways in which collective guilt/mania can capture and subvert language and narrative today. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Text and direction by Jack Sullivan, produced by Leigh Honigman, HOUSE ON FIRE is a devised, experimental one act to be performed at the Tank (312 W. 36th St.) in Manhattan on Feb 20, 21, and 23, 2019 </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WHY IT MATTERS</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To say that the country is polarized would be an understatement. After what appeared to be a shift in the nation’s social and political views under former President Barack Obama, the sudden turn to the right came as a shock to most people. The virulent racism and xenophobia espoused by President Trump and his supporters — and make no mistake, it is racism and xenophobia — feels as though from another, less-enlightened era. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>HOUSE ON FIRE proposes though that nothing really ever changed — those with privilege have just found new vocabulary, new gestures, new buildings, and structures to pave over the dark, poisoned heart of American culture. And if you were to put these people on stage to explain themselves, you might find they’d prove themselves to be just as bad, if not worse, than the monsters that came before them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>HOUSE ON FIRE is a play for today, exposing the ways in which white supremacy twists language and narrative to try to justify its actions. Yet the play is also contemporary in how it was made: with a diverse cast and production team (majority PoC and female actors), a production devised in collaboration from an open performance text by all on the production team, from directors to actor to sound designer. By utilizing this broad set of voices, in such a democratic manner, we hope to subvert the hive mind mentality and inflammatory rhetoric of Trumpian America, and expose it for the babble that it is. </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Live production has all sorts of risks and challenges. The most obvious challenge in New York City is making sure that artists get paid. All of the artists involved in this production work multiple jobs, have loans and rent payments to work about. Just the act of centering artistic production while financially unstable takes a great amount of courage. Another challenge being that the way we are working requires the actors/production teams full attention: each performer, designer, etc., will be involved at every step of the process, necessitating a lot of thought and training both within the rehearsal room, and without. We want to make sure the actors and production team are compensated for their time and effort, so that they may fully commit themselves to exploring the important themes that the text presents. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The final challenge that goes along with that is making sure that artists (actors and production staff) as well as the audience feel that they are in the space that is conducive to conversation. As a production team we want to make sure we have the ability to provide resources for both actors/audiences, and have the wherewithal to be able to reach out to academics/other figures in the community to come in and help facilitate conversation post show.  </p>

<p><strong>SEND COOL GIRAFFES TO HHI 2018<br/><br/>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p>Based out of the Kore Dance Studio in Edmonton, Alberta. Cool Giraffes is a pre-professional dance company that was originated as a dance project founded by Randall Mella in the summer of 2016. The project was developed by Randall to showcase his craft as a choreographer in the competitive circuit as well as dance and to have fun with his group of friends. In the past two years- the team debuted at World of Dance Edmonton, garnered tremendous support by the local dance community, competed across Canada, and has grown to over 35+ members and alumni.  </p>
<p>The team has transitioned into a hip hop company consisting of 28 members who come from different walks of life and range between the ages of 14 to 27. Current directors, Randall Mella and Thomas Boivin, ensure that with dance comes a strong foundation of friendship and hard work. With these values, we are consistently inspired and encouraged to support one another to strive to be the best we can be as dancers and people.<br/><br/><strong>CURRENTLY</strong></p>
<p>It has been an exciting year for the team as the team received first place in the Mega Crew All-Stars Category at Represent Street Dance Competition and competed at Hip-Hop International’s regional qualifiers. The team travelled to Ottawa in June to compete and qualified to represent Canada at Hip Hop International being held in Phoenix, Arizona. The team is honoured to be one of three megacrews to represent Canada at worlds level.<br/><br/><strong>HELP OUT SOME COOL GIRAFFES</strong></p>
<p>To get to the world stage, each member is funding themselves individually and the costs of getting to Hip Hop International has taken a financial strain on each member. To support this trip, any amount helps and we are so incredibly thankful for your support in our journey to compete and represent our country at Hip Hop International World Championship 2018!</p>

Current directors, Randall Mella and Thomas Boivin, ensure that with dance comes a strong foundation of friendship and hard work. With these values, we are consistently inspired and encouraged to support one another to strive to be the best we can be as dancers and people.CURRENTLY
It has been an exciting year for the team as the team received first place in the Mega Crew All-Stars Category at Represent Street Dance Competition and competed at Hip-Hop International’s regional qualifiers. The team travelled to Ottawa in June to compete and qualified to represent Canada at Hip Hop International being held in Phoenix, Arizona. The team is honoured to be one of three megacrews to represent Canada at worlds level.HELP OUT SOME COOL GIRAFFES
To get to the world stage, each member is funding themselves individually and the costs of getting to Hip Hop International has taken a financial strain on each member. To support this trip, any amount helps and we are so incredibly thankful for your support in our journey to compete and represent our country at Hip Hop International World Championship 2018!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>Michael and Robert met over 10 years ago in a basement classroom at Circle in the Square Theatre in New York City.  Their bond was forged that first day of class over a soul searching acting exercise.  From that day forward they both knew they were destined to create magic onstage together one day.  That first collaborative opportunity came in 2012 ironically through Michael's wife, Vanessa Lenz Neithardt, and her play, <i>Names of the Dead</i>  ( FringeNYC– at the Connelly Theater.)  On top of co-producing with Vanessa, Michael took on the daunting role of playing a suicidal, PTSD suffering veteran. Just the right director was needed to handle this difficult material with the care and consideration it demanded.  The first person that came to mind was Robert Greene - a.k.a. RG—he jumped at the challenge.  Not only did RG direct the play with amazing grace and help elevate it to its greatest potential, but he also got to act onstage with Michael,  portraying his character's best friend in a poignant scene of the play. </p>
<p>Cut to 6 years later. After a lot of conversations and ideas flowing,  RG came to Michael with a rough draft of <i>Situations</i>.  Immediately Michael knew that it was something special—a deeply personal journey with a multitude of layers.  And who better to direct RG through this maze than his friend and confidant.  With the FringeNYC festival coming back after a one year hiatus, the timing was perfect. </p>
<p>Their roles have been shuffled and the trio is back at it again–Robert as writer/actor, Michael as director/producer and Vanessa as producer–all under the Palmy Inn umbrella (Michael's production company) showcasing once again at The New York International Fringe Festival.  Serendipitously, FringeNYC introduced a new program this year, FringeBYOV (Bring Your Own Venue) in order to reach stages and audiences in the outer boroughs.  </p>

The good people at Octakord, hearing our tale of woe, have generously agreed to charge us a mere $200 for a forty hour workshop process.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Showcase venue: TBD (check back for updates) We are still in talks to secure a venue for a performance on Sunday, August 4th, with a final rehearsal the day before. We need floors safe enough for the acrobatics, space for ten actors and their many instruments, height enough to stand on each others shoulders (literally!) and enough room to seat our eager audience. So far, the venues that meet this criteria and are available will cost about $500 for 2 weekend days of rehearsal and performance.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Stage Manager: TBD.

<p class=""p1"">Actors: The <em>Shakedown</em> Ensemble. Our actors originally signed on to the project for a very modest stipend of $450 each, covering 110 hours of rehearsal, 5 performances, and a lengthy commute. At the point at which the production was cancelled, we had completed about 40 hours of rehearsal, and it was clear that there would no longer be compensation for it. We’ve accepted that loss because of how strongly we believe in the project and each other. On the other hand, as kids trying to make it in the theatre, we all live pretty close to the financial edge, so $450 out of our pockets was a bit of a blow. The workshop we propose is 40 hours over two weeks, with a single performance, and we hope to raise $200 dollars for each of our actors, both to give them something for their work and also to offset their transportation and other costs associated with the previous unpaid rehearsal process.</p>

Give us a hand, won’t you?
The Players
Our cast is comprised of ten actor/musician/etceteras: Ben Euphrat, Will Hand, Nick Medina, Rebecca Pingree, Ari Rampy, Billy Raphael, Deborah Rucker, Terry Rucker, Leah Russo, Jeremy Vik, and, of course, our fearless leader Jon Tracy (writer/director/theatrical-bad-ass).

As artists, we are always trying to envision the best way to tell a story, but how do you tell one of the best stories ever? Jon has looked towards ritual as inspiration.

Each character relives their story, but also serves as the audience, the chorus, and the band for the others; each a part of this community bound together by the events of the play.
And check out these images that inspire the look of our world.
The Breakdown
The bare bones minimum we need is a rehearsal space, a showcase venue, a stage manager, and travel stipends for our artists. 
Anything we get above our goal will go to recouping our losses from the first part of our rehearsal process, compensating our lovely director, and toward the overall amazingness of our dear, dear Twelfth-Night-that-could.

<p>Presented at Pauper’s Pub as part of the Site-Specific program at the Toronto Fringe Festival, the show is a raucous, immersive satire of gender roles, army life, and war stories.</p>
<p><em>Terry Pratchett’s Monstrous Regiment </em>is the final production of Socratic Theatre Collective’s third season, and our fifth full-length production.  We are a Toronto-based independent theatre company; our mission is to produce theatre that creates a dialogue.  You talk to us in your applause, your presence and we talk back to you. And yes, we often talk about murder, mayhem, ghosts, girls in corsets, and badass ladies with knives, swords and knitting needles but isn’t that what you like talking about too? </p>
<p>Our previous productions are:  <em>Hamlet, Princess of Denmark</em>; <em>Ismene; The Dark Room</em>; the short play <em>Wrong Number</em>, for which we won the Fresh Spice Award at the 2012 What Are You Doing BACK There?! Festival; <em>Terry Pratchett’s Mort</em>; and the short play <em>Snow, Glass, Apples</em>.  Since our founding in 2010, we have won an award, received critical acclaim, raised funds for charity, collaborated with companies from across Canada, the United States, and Ireland, and produced world and Canadian premieres. If you want more details, have a look at our website, <a href=""http://www.socratictheatre.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.socratictheatre.com</strong></a>.  We’re really not shy about what we’ve achieved.</p>
<p>However, as proud as we are of our history, returning to the Toronto Fringe Festival with<em>Terry Pratchett’s Monstrous Regiment</em> is a huge undertaking for the company.  We are going to be bringing war, mayhem, and a large amount of cross-dressing to Toronto theatre.  And you’re going to help us because who doesn’t want to bring all these things to Toronto?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our campaign goal is $3500.00.  Of that total, here is how it breaks down:</p>
<p>$1000.00 goes to the rental of our rehearsal spaces.</p>
<p>$900.00 goes to the royalties for <em>Terry Pratchett’s Monstrous Regiment.</em></p>
<p>$725.00 goes to our participation fee for the Toronto Fringe Festival</p>
<p>$875.00 goes to our props and costumes.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our full goal, this is the order in which the funds will be prioritized (ie, we will use them to pay for the rental first, then the royalties, etc.).</p>

<p>WEAR THE LILAC CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>In honour of Terry Pratchett’s ongoing battle with Alzheimer’s disease, we will be continuing the Wear the Lilac Campaign that began with last year’s fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<p>For any contribution made to this campaign, Socratic Theatre Collective will donate the equivalent of 10% to the Alzheimer Society of Canada.  In other words, if you donate $100 to us, we'll donate $10 to the Alzheimer Society of Canada out of our own pocket.</p>
<p>Last year, the Wear the Lilac campaign raised $171 for the Alzheimer Society of Canada.  Our goal for this year is $300, so help us make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But wait!” you say, “Aren’t you charging admission?  Why can’t you use that money to pay for all of these things?”  To which we say:  look at the breakdown.  There is no entry for artist fees or wages.  This is because NO-ONE at Socratic Theatre Collective is paid up front; everyone works on the shows on a volunteer basis.  If the campaign for <em>Terry Pratchett’s Monstrous Regiment </em>is fully funded, it means that the box office revenue can be divided between the fourteen cast members and the director and stage manager.  This means that sixteen people will actually get paid a small amount for their hard work and their considerable sacrifice of time and energy.  We all want to keep making theatre, and we want to make sure that Socratic Theatre Collective is able to attract top-quality artists to work with us.  And don’t you want to see us produce more shows like <em>Monstrous Regiment</em>?</p>

<p>Remember – even the smallest contribution helps!  And what else helps?  Getting the word out, and telling people about us!  Post our campaign on Facebook, and don’t forget to use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">FUNDRAISER ENDS AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT!!</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Excuse me for the long update but I have been asked these questions quite a bit and thought it would be helpful if I addressed them to everyone: <br/><br/> ""why not raise ticket prices to help with the funding"", <br/><br/> ""what about buying one projector now and the rest later"",  <br/><br/> ""what will you do if you don't reach your goal"" and <br/><br/> ""will you stay in business if you don't reach your goal""  <br/><span>...<br/><br/><br/> Here goes:<br/><br/> We initially thought about raising the ticket prices but decided not to for a couple of reasons.  First is that we want to stay true to our business model which is to be an affordable family entertainment venue. Raising prices goes against this.  Plus, 35-45% of every dollar we bring in goes to the movie studios so if we raised prices all we would be doing is putting more money in their pocket.  No thanks.<br/><br/> I  wish we could buy the projectors one at a time and spread out the payments but the reason we were forced to turn to crowdsourcing is that film won't be available after this year.  We need to convert all now.<br/><br/> We still have several days left and are still hoping to reach our goal, or get close to it. That said, crowdsourcing is never a guaranteed success. We knew that going into this and we do have a backup plan. If we do not raise the full amount by the 30th, we will do other various fundraising events to close the gap.<br/><br/> The business is solid - we aren't raising money to keep the business afloat because we made poor business decisions - we're raising money to buy projectors we didn't know we'd need when we opened 7 years ago. The money raised is ONLY going to projectors - not to paying our bills. We've promoted the heck out of this thing online and in the media and we are hoping donations will continue to come in between now and the end of the campaign.  <br/><br/> Thank you to everyone who has supported us!  We are blown away by the support and we hope in these last four days, we can keep the momentum and get to our goal!<br/><br/> Thanks, Julie</span></p>

</h2>
<p>Seven years ago, we preserved an important piece of Portland’s cinematic history and helped transform an entire neighborhood in the process.</p>
<p>Now we’re at a crossroads, and we need your help. Simply put, without your financial support, rather than preserving history, we may <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">become</span> history.</p>
<p>Here’s the scoop: For close to a century, the words <strong><em>movie</em> </strong>and <strong><em>film</em></strong> have been interchangeable. Soon this won’t be the case. By year’s end, all new Hollywood releases will only be screened digitally, rendering 35mm projection equipment obsolete. </p>
<p>If the Academy Theater wants to avoid the fate of those who believed “talkies” were simply a fad, we must convert from film to digital equipment as soon as possible. But that's not as easy as it sounds.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, new equipment is incredibly expensive. Upgrading to digital projectors in all three theaters will cost approximately $96,000. Installation costs and necessary sound system upgrades will require an additional $21,000. As you can imagine, this is an enormous financial burden for a small independent theater.</p>
<p>Our (admittedly) ambitious goal is to raise $75,000 (or more!) by September 30, 2013. This amount will help cover the total cost of three new digital projectors, sound system upgrades, installation charges and Indiegogo processing fees. You can help us reach this goal by making a donation today. </p>

Excuse me for the long update but I have been asked these questions quite a bit and thought it would be helpful if I addressed them to everyone:  ""why not raise ticket prices to help with the funding"",  ""what about buying one projector now and the rest later"",   ""what will you do if you don't reach your goal"" and  ""will you stay in business if you don't reach your goal""  ... Here goes: We initially thought about raising the ticket prices but decided not to for a couple of reasons.  First is that we want to stay true to our business model which is to be an affordable family entertainment venue. Raising prices goes against this.  Plus, 35-45% of every dollar we bring in goes to the movie studios so if we raised prices all we would be doing is putting more money in their pocket.  No thanks. I  wish we could buy the projectors one at a time and spread out the payments but the reason we were forced to turn to crowdsourcing is that film won't be available after this year.  We need to convert all now. We still have several days left and are still hoping to reach our goal, or get close to it. That said, crowdsourcing is never a guaranteed success. We knew that going into this and we do have a backup plan. If we do not raise the full amount by the 30th, we will do other various fundraising events to close the gap. The business is solid - we aren't raising money to keep the business afloat because we made poor business decisions - we're raising money to buy projectors we didn't know we'd need when we opened 7 years ago. The money raised is ONLY going to projectors - not to paying our bills. We've promoted the heck out of this thing online and in the media and we are hoping donations will continue to come in between now and the end of the campaign.   Thank you to everyone who has supported us!  We are blown away by the support and we hope in these last four days, we can keep the momentum and get to our goal! Thanks, Julie
 
 
 
Overview

Seven years ago, we preserved an important piece of Portland’s cinematic history and helped transform an entire neighborhood in the process.
Now we’re at a crossroads, and we need your help. Simply put, without your financial support, rather than preserving history, we may become history.
Here’s the scoop: For close to a century, the words movie and film have been interchangeable. Soon this won’t be the case. By year’s end, all new Hollywood releases will only be screened digitally, rendering 35mm projection equipment obsolete. 
If the Academy Theater wants to avoid the fate of those who believed “talkies” were simply a fad, we must convert from film to digital equipment as soon as possible. But that's not as easy as it sounds.
 
DIGITAL CONVERSION: Frequently Asked Questions  http://www.academytheaterpdx.com/digital-conversion-fundraising/


 
What We Need & What You Get
Unfortunately, new equipment is incredibly expensive. Upgrading to digital projectors in all three theaters will cost approximately $96,000. Installation costs and necessary sound system upgrades will require an additional $21,000. As you can imagine, this is an enormous financial burden for a small independent theater.
Our (admittedly) ambitious goal is to raise $75,000 (or more!) by September 30, 2013. This amount will help cover the total cost of three new digital projectors, sound system upgrades, installation charges and Indiegogo processing fees. You can help us reach this goal by making a donation today. 
In exchange for your contribution, we will reward you with one of the many fabulous incentives listed on the right hand side of this page. 
Any amount, however small, helps push us closer to our goal. 
Assuming we reach this goal, digital conversion will happen immediately (although installation of new equipment may take several days.) And once new projectors are installed, our movies will look and sound better than ever!

Summary
I grew up in a smaller town in Oklahoma.  I started
dancing when I was 6, graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a B.S. in
Health and Sport Sciences, and have been tap dancing professionally in Chicago
for the last 13 years.  In 2008, I started Dance Profusion Project - an
annual weekend of master classes and workshops for dancers in Oklahoma with professional
dancers from Chicago.
Dance
Profusion Project was founded in 2008 to create cultural impact in Oklahoma by:  
          -   providing quality dance education through master classes and
workshops with Chicago-based professional dancers and Directors.          -  creating career path opportunities in Chicago for Oklahoma
dancers.
          -  being an additional resource to increase dance awareness and
education in Oklahoma.
          -  reaching dancers who do not have the opportunity to seek
continuing education outside of Oklahoma.
This
year marks the 6th year of DPP, and the 2nd year of self-producing a dance concert. Contributing to this project will allow
DPP to bring at least 2 of Chicago's best tap and rhythmic dance companies to Oklahoma for a

The vision of our shows as well as our work offstage is to enable individuals to live more beautiful stories and to discover their purpose. We believe that dance is a powerful vehicle that can draw up a personal awakening in the human soul. Our dancers, directors, and board donate all of their talents and time as volunteers to invest in the lives that surround us, we don't keep a cent.  The funds we raise by ticket sales at each show go directly into our cause for the particular show. This campaign's purpose is to raise the initial funding we need to bring our shows to light. Your contributions will go towards initial production costs, advertising, merchandise, and the remainder will be donated to our cause. The first showing of ""Illustrated"" on August 23, 2014 will scholarship a child's full dance tuition for one year. The dance student will then be mentored in writing an anonymous blog for the duration of the scholarship about dance and its impact and influence in their life. The link to the blog will be posted on our website so you can share in their joy . Be moved. Become an ambassador of love. YOU can help!

<p><em>Charles Ponzi - A Dollar and a Scheme</em> is a biographical play on the life of Italian born swindler Charles Ponzi (1882 - 1949), inventor of the notorious Ponzi Scheme*.<br/> It starts in the year 1948, in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, where Ponzi spent the end of his life in semi-blindness, confined to a wheel-chair and completely penniless. The play is a journey through the fascinating experiences Ponzi had from the day he decided to leave his native country for the U.S.A. to the time he achieved fame and prosperity at the expense of fifty thousand people, and was arrested as a result. Ponzi was a self-confident, charismatic and educated young man who came from a northern Italian middle class family. In 1920 he found a way to exploit the very rules of capitalism and rapidly emerged as one of the wealthiest capitalists in America. Investment frauds tied to the Ponzi scheme have become daily front-page news.</p>
<p><em><strong>This play is an advocacy against the evils of capitalistic venture when in the hands of a-moral organizations and/or individuals; it exposes the mindset of a class of society that is geared towards profits without the regulating processes of law, decency and civil responsibility. Think subprime mortgage experiment (a Ponzi scheme) and the financial meltdown it created left in its trails: economic inequality, foreclosures, unemployment, loss of living standards, while corporate profits are soaring.</strong></em></p>

The play starts on film, at the end of Ponzi's life, months before his death, and is constructed like a biographical story- telling - interspersed with newsreel, actual images from Ponzi's life and his surroundings - in which Ponzi looks back on his life and his accomplishments, which for him were incomparable in American history.

to produce the world premiere of James Michael Shobergâ€™s latest stage
adaptation, which will be a grim, violent twist on J. M. Barrieâ€™s novel, <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, set in a bleak,
futuristic London. The piece, aptly entitled, <b><i>Hooked</i></b><i>, </i><span style="""">will take our audiences into an unsettling, grimy
future, where societal decay has left London a ruined husk of the city it once
was, overwrought with crime and drugs. When an injured young anti-hero,
referring to himself only as ""Pan,"" crosses paths with a young girl,
Wendy Darling, she and her two brothers, Michael and John, are drawn deep into
the heart of the city, where even the junkies, prostitutes, street gangs, and
piratical thugs have something to fear...a young, disfigured drug lord named
James...better known in the streets as ""Hook.""<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span style=""color: #00B0F0;""> </span></span></span>The
piece will also feature characters such as a chemist named Mr. Smee; a gay,

brothel.<i></i></p><p></p>

Rage quickly became, and still are, some of my closest friends. And secondly,
our shows were fantastic. The attention to detail in the scripts, costumes, set
designs, props, etc., made it feel like a different world. I was excited for

artists, who travel long distances from within Pennsylvania and the Tri-state
area to work with us. Lovers of our unique brand of theatre, these artists
volunteer hundreds of hours to making The Rage of the Stage Players a success.
They appreciate the opportunity to hone their various talents in a theatrical
setting. This is best illustrated in the case of The Rage of the Stage Playersâ€™
makeup and special effects designer, Greg Lightner, another of our volunteers, who
was recently chosen to compete on the second season of  the SyFy Channelâ€™s makeup/special effects

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Throughout the companyâ€™s ten-year history, most of the
productions have been original works conceived by Co-Executive Producer and
Artistic Director, James Michael Shoberg.  We have, however, had the occasion and
privilege to debut the writing of other local playwrights, as well. This past
fall, James received permission fromThe Butcher Brothers and Lionsgate Films,
to adapt their award-winning, independent horror film, <i>The Hamiltons</i>, into a live stage play. The Rage of the Stage
Players overwhelmingly well-received production of <i>The Hamiltons</i> was featured in Fangoria.com, Pittsburgh Exhumed,
Pittsburgh Magazine, and Rue Morgue Magazine. (See <b>Recent Media Coverage</b> below.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: #31849B;""></span></p><p> </p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Additionally, The Rage of the Stage Players are an annual participant

kind, helping other playwrights to improve their plays through the process of a
first full production. </p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Rage of the Stage Players, supported solely from ticket
sales and individual donations since our inception in 2001, have never received
grant money.  Ticket sales cover only 25%
of our costs.  We depend on people just
like you to donate the rest of the money to help us bring our vision of theatre
to the stage. Our seasons are comprised of two shows, one in the spring and one
in the fall. Monies made from each production are used to mount the next, with
the success of each, determining the scale of the one to follow. The actors and
production crew work on a strictly-voluntary basis, donating both time and
talent. Though weâ€™ve proceeded independently without significant outside
financial support over the past ten years, The Rage of the Stage Players are
now in need of funding to continue creating a brand of theatre that is uniquely
our own. That is why we are embarking on our first large fundraising campaign. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b><font><font color=""#330033"" size=""4"">Recent Media Coverage</font></font></b><span style=""font-weight: 800;""><u><br/></u></span></p>

to produce the world premiere of James Michael Shobergâ€™s latest stage
adaptation, which will be a grim, violent twist on J. M. Barrieâ€™s novel, Peter and Wendy, set in a bleak,
futuristic London. The piece, aptly entitled, Hooked, will take our audiences into an unsettling, grimy
future, where societal decay has left London a ruined husk of the city it once
was, overwrought with crime and drugs. When an injured young anti-hero,
referring to himself only as ""Pan,"" crosses paths with a young girl,
Wendy Darling, she and her two brothers, Michael and John, are drawn deep into
the heart of the city, where even the junkies, prostitutes, street gangs, and
piratical thugs have something to fear...a young, disfigured drug lord named
James...better known in the streets as ""Hook."" The
piece will also feature characters such as a chemist named Mr. Smee; a gay,
male escort called Tinker Bell, and Princess Tiger Lily, a madam at a local
brothel.
 
Your gift will allow The Rage of the Stage Players to
proceed with our plans for our upcoming 2012 season. It will allow Western
Pennsylvanians to see new and extremely visceral theatre, and allow actors and
production crew to continue to practice and share their work with audiences.
All gifts are tax-deductible to the
full extent of the law. Every gift is deeply appreciated and makes a huge
difference. Who We Are
 
The Rage of the Stage Players are a not-for-profit fringe theatre
group that produces original works, with predominantly dark and mature themes. We
are, in fact, the only group in Western Pennsylvania that performs such
material not merely as seasonal Halloween fareâ€¦but instead, as the core of our
companyâ€™s productions. The Rage of the Stage Players extend the opportunity to
any student (18 years of age and older) or adult in the community, who wishes
to apply an artistic skill in a theatrical setting. We strive to
satisfy darker tastes in art, and thusly, have developed a fan-base
composed of those who seek it. 
 
 
When I was traveling from
West Chester to work with Rage, I was commuting about 350 miles. There are a
lot of reasons that I was willing to do this, but two were most prominent. Firstly,
it was the most fun Iâ€™ve consistently had to this day. The people I met through
Rage quickly became, and still are, some of my closest friends. And secondly,
our shows were fantastic. The attention to detail in the scripts, costumes, set
designs, props, etc., made it feel like a different world. I was excited for
every show to go up, because I was proud of all the things we did. I couldnâ€™t
wait for my friends and family to see what we had been creating.
 
-Sean Michael Gallaher,
Actor
 
 
I keep coming to Rage
performances because the company never fails to deliver creative, witty, edgy
and delightfully deviant theater.  It makes me smile and shake my head at
the same time, with its unique twists on familiar stories and hilarious takes
on the darkest sides of life.  It's entertaining in the most inappropriate
ways, and I really love that.
 
-David Giesler, Patron
 
 
When I returned to
Pittsburgh after ten years, I had been annihilated by â€œAnnie,â€ beaten by
Beckett, shaken from Shakespeare, and rocked from â€œThe Rocky Horror Show.â€ I
wanted something fringe, frightening, and fresh. I chose The Rage of the Stage
Players and luckily, they chose me, too.
 
-Lori Howsare,
Actress/Artistic Director of One Mom Productions
 
 
Rage has made every mile I
traveled worth it. There is simply no other theatre company that puts such
immense detail, not only into the original writing, but into creating the
magical world, which appears on that page. Every stroke of makeup, fabric of a costume,
and board of scenery is so beautifully crafted, that there is no other
comparable theatre experience. You arenâ€™t just acting in a playâ€¦you are, for at
least a brief period, living in this fantastical world of make-believe.
 
-Alyssa Herron, Actress
 
I started working with Rage because of the intense creativity and passion that they put into every show. I'm a traditionally and classically trained actor and a lot of that training can make us complacent and a little stale as artists. Rage challenges me to think differently and to use my skills in new and unusual ways. It's just a lot of fun!
 
-Dek Ingraham,
Actor/Managing Artistic Director of Phase 3 Productions
 
 
Rage consistently promises
visually and emotionally engaging productions. Having known the Founders/Producers
for many years, I hold them to that promise.  While other
theatre groups may fall short, Rage never fails to draw me in, while immersing
me in their twisted, dark, and humorous world. 
Having personally been able to participate in one of their shows (even in a
small capacity), I can say their level of professionalism and dedication to the
craft is fantastic. Not to mention, the experience was a lot
of fun as well! A few years ago I moved away from Pittsburgh. However, I still
make every attempt to return home and catch one of Rage's new productions.
Recently I flew home from Florida to attend their production of ""The
Hamiltons,"" and was blown away, as usual. I will continue
to support Rage in the future and am proud to tell people about the great work
Jim and Carrie do. I am looking forward to the next time I can escape for a few
hours, forget about life's troubles and enjoy the show.

Patron
 
 
This is your
chance to become part of the dark magic that is The Rage of the Stage Players. Donate
now, and join our carnival of theatrical artistry. Every gift, no matter how large or small, makes
an impact on our local fringe theatre troupe.
 
James Michael and Carrie L. Shoberg co-founded The Rage of
the Stage Players in 2001. Our independent group is comprised of fringe
artists, who travel long distances from within Pennsylvania and the Tri-state
area to work with us. Lovers of our unique brand of theatre, these artists
volunteer hundreds of hours to making The Rage of the Stage Players a success.
They appreciate the opportunity to hone their various talents in a theatrical
setting. This is best illustrated in the case of The Rage of the Stage Playersâ€™
makeup and special effects designer, Greg Lightner, another of our volunteers, who
was recently chosen to compete on the second season of  the SyFy Channelâ€™s makeup/special effects
reality show, â€œFace Off.â€ 
 
 
I really have to thank Jim
Shoberg, personally, for believing in me, and coming up with these amazing
concepts for Rage. I was really only ever an instrument, a medium to realize
his vision. In the end, it was Jim, who was muse to me, and inspired every
creation. I can take credit for the makeup and designs, but they would be
nothing without him, his creativity, and dare I say, genius? Yes, I dare. I
love the synergy that we have together.
 
-Greg Lightner,
Makeup/Special Effects Designer   
 
Throughout the companyâ€™s ten-year history, most of the
productions have been original works conceived by Co-Executive Producer and
Artistic Director, James Michael Shoberg.  We have, however, had the occasion and
privilege to debut the writing of other local playwrights, as well. This past
fall, James received permission fromThe Butcher Brothers and Lionsgate Films,
to adapt their award-winning, independent horror film, The Hamiltons, into a live stage play. The Rage of the Stage
Players overwhelmingly well-received production of The Hamiltons was featured in Fangoria.com, Pittsburgh Exhumed,
Pittsburgh Magazine, and Rue Morgue Magazine. (See Recent Media Coverage below.)
 
Additionally, The Rage of the Stage Players are an annual participant
in The Pittsburgh New Works Festival, the only one-act play festival of its
kind, helping other playwrights to improve their plays through the process of a
first full production. 
 
We Need Your Help
The Rage of the Stage Players, supported solely from ticket
sales and individual donations since our inception in 2001, have never received
grant money.  Ticket sales cover only 25%
of our costs.  We depend on people just
like you to donate the rest of the money to help us bring our vision of theatre
to the stage. Our seasons are comprised of two shows, one in the spring and one
in the fall. Monies made from each production are used to mount the next, with
the success of each, determining the scale of the one to follow. The actors and
production crew work on a strictly-voluntary basis, donating both time and
talent. Though weâ€™ve proceeded independently without significant outside
financial support over the past ten years, The Rage of the Stage Players are
now in need of funding to continue creating a brand of theatre that is uniquely
our own. That is why we are embarking on our first large fundraising campaign. Recent Media Coverage

With so many fewer seats, we cannot produce Evil Dead The
Musical at the level it deserves based on ticket sales alone.  That’s why we need your collective help to make
this show great, and to keep ticket prices down for all of us, so no-one has to miss out on this great experience.
What We Need We don't want to sacrifice the quality of the production that the audience has become accustomed to, but we need more than just ticket sales to keep at the level we previously achieved: we have plans to make it better than ever! 
What your money will help to pay for is: 

Royalties to the Authors via their agency (Samuel French):  They wrote an amazing show and deserve to be paid for it!
 
Printing costs: Full programs, posters, and advertising materials:  The more audience there is, the more fun to be shared!

Set Construction: We need to build a car, a cabin in the woods, the woods themselves, talking animals and perhaps a flying money or beaver or something.

Blood: LOTS of Blood!

Costumes: We considered having the actors perform naked, but then we'd have to charge you extra for tickets to cover all the fines and lawsuits.

More Blood: LOTS AND LOTS of Blood!

Props: Shotguns, chainsaws and severed body parts aren't cheap!

Did I mention Blood? LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of Blood!
