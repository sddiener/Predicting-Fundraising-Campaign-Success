Blackwyrm Books And Games is a publisher of experimental fiction and quality roleplaying games. In conjunction with Hero Games' release of the Star Hero 6th Edition roleplaying game at GenCon 2011, we are attempting to simultaneously release seven science fiction settings that can be played using the Star Hero rules.  
 
We're calling this entire undertaking Project WyrmStar. 



The Impact

Hero Games isn't planning on releasing any settings for Star Hero: only the core rulebook and some equipment books. We are hoping to ""fill the gap"" that leaves by releasing unique and interesting setting books that can be used to play the game immediately, rather than forcing Game Masters to take the time to create their own setting. 
 
Terracide for HERO System 6th Edition is one of these settings. 



What We Need & What You Get

Humanity was struggling to catch up with its alien neighbors when Terra ceased to exist.
 
The attack had been a long time coming; it had traveled for over 200 years before it hit. Thousands of relativistic weapons swept across the system in a matter of hours, moving too swiftly for anyone to see them coming, try to escape, or to warn anyone else what was happening. When they struck the homeworld, the surface of Terra became a molten holocaust, and the oceans boiled away into the tortured skies. Every settlement on Luna, Mars, and the Galilean moons met the same fate. Colonies on smaller moons and asteroids simply shattered, vaporized instantly by the impact. In the final hours of the attack, on the fringe of Sol's oort cloud, the last comet-herders were just beginning to figure out something was wrong as they went off the air, one by one. And then it was over. 
 
There were no survivors.
 
Terracide (by Grady Elliott) is a gritty, space opera noir. The Earth has been annihilated, leaving only the few thousand humans who were working in deep space alive. Those who have survived must not only continue the human race, but to discover who--or what--destroyed their home world. Players can chose from character Package Deals that include private eye, pirate, socialite, soldier, and many, many more.

<p><i>It was 1096th. Europe drowned in drought, crop failure and
famine. Those days were terrible and natural cataclysms forced people to think
how close the doomsday was, when Jesus Christ will come down to Earth for the
Last Judgment of the living and the dead. At this time Peter the Hermit appeared
on the roads of Europe. Sitting on a donkey, barefoot,   holding a crucifix in his hands, traveling
from city to city, preaching in squares and roads. He said that Christian
churches in the East are turning into pigsties, and Christians are taken away
into slavery, that church services are banned, and that Church of the Holy Sepulcher had been desecrated.
His eloquence impressed the crowds, every mind was ignited, and every heart was
touched, anger and rage boiled up in every Christian’s blood. </i></p>
<p><i>Peter preaches his gospel in the Eternal City of Rome. Pope
Urban II summons Catholics to regain the kingdom of God. Like lightening
hitting the ground, the shout of innumerable crowd's hearts explodes in the air
of the square: “God wants it, God wants it!” At that moment every faithful
human swore to go and release Jerusalem. The news spread in a whole Europe as
fast as a wind. All ranks, ages and estates were mixed under the Cross.</i></p>
<p><i>Those days were grim, all thoughts were addressed to
Jerusalem, in light of coming doomsday, as expected a path of wander would
become a path of eternity. How else could sins be redeemed without capture of
the Holy Sepulcher?»</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/937905/files/20141017063923-Untitled-5.jpg?1413553163"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Single

a synergy of a board game with elements of tower defense and something similar
to angry birds. The entire plot of single player game was illustrated by hand
by our artist. In single player there will be no repetitive missions with the
sole goal of mechanical elimination of enemy's troops. Instead there will be a
linear storyline accompanied with missions where you will have to reinforce and
defend your fortifications, endure intense assaults and execute timely and
well-judged counterattacks. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/936418/files/20141016142105-Untitled-6.jpg?1413494465"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The whole
goal of single player campaign is to make you rationalize and think through
your decisions in order to develop the most efficient strategy for achieving
victory in multiplayer game.</p>
<p>The main
idea behind the game’s mechanics is in wise placement of troops which will give
the player advantage in battle. For example a regiment consisting of 3-5
soldiers of the same type has a great bonus to attack and defense. However if
the regiment is dissipated by a precise strike of an arrow or spear the whole
bonus will be nullified. The player can quickly rearrange his soldiers and
whole lines of troops in order to gain his advantage. For example if your first
line of swordsmen is attacked by cavalry, you can quickly switch this line with
a line of pikemen. Also you can manually control your ranged attacks in order
to focus your barrage of arrows on particularly important regiments of your
adversary. Different troops specialize on eliminating particular type of enemy
troops. For example swordsmen are highly effective against pikemen and pikemen
are effective against cavalry and so on. </p>
<p>There are 5
types of primary units – cavalry, swordsmen, pikemen, peasants and archers-
each type has their own advantages and drawbacks. For example assaulting
cavalry can instantly kill the first unit on their way, so it is wise to put

story about the liberation of the Holy Sepulcher and the Holy Land.
It was 1096th. Europe drowned in drought, crop failure and
famine. Those days were terrible and natural cataclysms forced people to think
how close the doomsday was, when Jesus Christ will come down to Earth for the
Last Judgment of the living and the dead. At this time Peter the Hermit appeared
on the roads of Europe. Sitting on a donkey, barefoot,   holding a crucifix in his hands, traveling
from city to city, preaching in squares and roads. He said that Christian
churches in the East are turning into pigsties, and Christians are taken away
into slavery, that church services are banned, and that Church of the Holy Sepulcher had been desecrated.
His eloquence impressed the crowds, every mind was ignited, and every heart was
touched, anger and rage boiled up in every Christian’s blood. 
Peter preaches his gospel in the Eternal City of Rome. Pope
Urban II summons Catholics to regain the kingdom of God. Like lightening
hitting the ground, the shout of innumerable crowd's hearts explodes in the air
of the square: “God wants it, God wants it!” At that moment every faithful
human swore to go and release Jerusalem. The news spread in a whole Europe as
fast as a wind. All ranks, ages and estates were mixed under the Cross.
Those days were grim, all thoughts were addressed to
Jerusalem, in light of coming doomsday, as expected a path of wander would
become a path of eternity. How else could sins be redeemed without capture of
the Holy Sepulcher?»Single
player campaign describes the times when thousands of Christians went from
Europe to the East in order to liberate the Holy Sepulcher. Our
goal is to recreate atmosphere of Middle Ages, to make the game stylish,
beautiful and alive, that is why each and every image, icon or background was
redrawn several times until we could confidently say “yes, this is exactly what
we were looking for”. We would like to recreate setting that you can
see in Ridley Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven and the first part of Assasin’s Creed.Music from our game:The game is
a synergy of a board game with elements of tower defense and something similar
to angry birds. The entire plot of single player game was illustrated by hand
by our artist. In single player there will be no repetitive missions with the
sole goal of mechanical elimination of enemy's troops. Instead there will be a
linear storyline accompanied with missions where you will have to reinforce and
defend your fortifications, endure intense assaults and execute timely and
well-judged counterattacks. The whole
goal of single player campaign is to make you rationalize and think through
your decisions in order to develop the most efficient strategy for achieving
victory in multiplayer game.
The main
idea behind the game’s mechanics is in wise placement of troops which will give
the player advantage in battle. For example a regiment consisting of 3-5
soldiers of the same type has a great bonus to attack and defense. However if
the regiment is dissipated by a precise strike of an arrow or spear the whole
bonus will be nullified. The player can quickly rearrange his soldiers and
whole lines of troops in order to gain his advantage. For example if your first
line of swordsmen is attacked by cavalry, you can quickly switch this line with
a line of pikemen. Also you can manually control your ranged attacks in order
to focus your barrage of arrows on particularly important regiments of your
adversary. Different troops specialize on eliminating particular type of enemy
troops. For example swordsmen are highly effective against pikemen and pikemen
are effective against cavalry and so on. 
There are 5
types of primary units – cavalry, swordsmen, pikemen, peasants and archers-
each type has their own advantages and drawbacks. For example assaulting
cavalry can instantly kill the first unit on their way, so it is wise to put
the least valuable peasants in the line of attack. At the same time in each
battle including multiplayer game amount of soldiers is limited (knights in
full armor can not appear in the middle of the desert from nowhere) so life of
every soldier is valuable and thoughtless attack incurring substantial losses
can prevent the player from winning in the long term. 
So a
plethora of gameplay nuances gives the player tremendous amount of
miscellaneous tactical and strategic solutions that of course can be
implemented in full during a multiplayer game online and that will make your
game with your friends truly interesting and captivating.You will be
able to use a number of improvements and achievements from single player game
in multiplayer after you unlock them. Also, in multiplayer you will be able to
reinforce your fortifications and encampments right during the battle. In PvP
game players will be matched according to their level. Such parameters as
amount of troops that you can use during each battle , their level and arming
will depend on how well the player manages his assets. Player can learn how to
adequately manage his resources during the single player game. So before
starting multiplayer game it will be necessary to complete several missions in
single player.Investing
real money in the game will allow you to purchase additional game currency-
treasures (1$ = 1 treasure). Using this currency player will be able:- To hire mercenaries from
other countries for 4 treasuers per unit (mercenaries can exceed hiring limits).- Purchase special weapons and armor from Damascus and Milanese
steel (5 - 10 treasures).- Acquire Holy Relics which will improve battle morale of player’s
troops. - Also player will be able to unlock paid mode Crusader (cost 5 treasures, one time
payment for a year) which will expedite draft of troops after battle and will permanently
increase battle morale of troops.

What is the Walled Garden?


The Walled Garden is an action/platformer PC game set in an surrealistic Garden of Eden. I
 am developing the game for the PC (with a little support from some 
friends) with hopes to bring it to more platforms such as PSP and Mac if it's successful.


The intent of this game was to create a hectic platform shooter; 

Where destroying terrain was both a strategy, defense, and general way of getting around the levels.

Destructive terrain acts as a good puzzle system in terms of using the terrain to your advantage.

The whole game aims to be a Random juxtaposition.

Who are You?

My name is Derek Boe I am an independent artist and game developer. 
Who is very much the epitome of a starving artist, currently I am 
attending the Alberta College of Art and Design for a bachelor of fine arts in Media Arts & Digital Technologies.You can view my portfolio website here to see more of my work.I started making this game back in 2008
I have been working very hard on this game by myself doing all the art/animation, programming and sound effects.
What still needs to be done?


Finish working with some composers

Begin designing art for the levels such as backgrounds and tile art.

Work on the levels and focus on making the level design fun and interesting

Fix up any small bugs with some of the enemy A.I.
Get some testers to play my game before release




What do you need money for?

School tuition (average $2000 per semester)

Sadly... art school isn't cheap; I need some assistance to pay for my tuition if I want to work on this game full-time.



Working on this game in my spare time is only going to get me so far on 
it. And the only way I can work on this game full-time is to get some 
funding, so
 if you would like to help me or see this game out ASAP please donate to
 help support the project.

Since I will be releasing the game for free, I will not be making any profit from the games release what so ever.


Any extra funding will help pay for music and advertising.Even if I don't achieve my funding goal, the game will still be made; Though chances are, if they goal is not met I not be going to school next semester.What do I get if I donate?


Donating $5 or more gets you same-day access to regular 'work-in-progress' versions of the game
Instant early access to the full version

Access to pitch ideas and critique the games condition

Your name in the credits as a special thanks
There are bigger rewards for donating more


(these are examples of the bleach work that I do, which is what comes with a donation of $50 or more)




Other Ways You Can Help!


Don't forget, if you can't donate to the project the least you can do is share this link to some of your friends.
The only way I can get help is by getting noticed so the more exposure I can get, the better.
Remember there are quick and easy sharing tools above this post near the top. /\",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p><h3><u>How it All Started</u></h3>
<p></p><h4>Thomas Lah(CEO)</h4><p>Growing up my father was an engineer, he worked on projects
like Netflix. One day I had an idea where people would be able to stream games
through a cross platform system and not be restricted to only playing good
games on things like a console, but be able to play high end games on things
like a phone. Being a college student I was tired of paying 60$ for a game and
500$ for a console. We thought this would be a great opportunity for me to
start this adventure. So I drove to Washington D.C. where I met with some investors
and networked with people. I worked with multiple business people, and people from
my College to build up this concept and idea. As we progressed we worked day in
and day out on the best way to allow Gamers the full control of their systems
but without the steep prices of gaming products these days.</p><p></p><h3>

<h3><u>Publishers</u></h3>
<p>With the extensive platform we provide allowing gamers
instant access to any game we provide, we would like to offer publishers all
around the world the opportunity to be able to have their game featured on our
marketplace (GOI Sphere) through the “Developers Package” perk. GamersOnline is
extending its hands out to all publishers of any level, whether you run a
successful gaming publishing company, or you are a young kid that wants to
share his or her game with the world! If you have a great game, we can help the
world see it. As long as its GamersOnline approved then it will be placed on
our platform. </p>
<p><b>GamersOnline Approved
means games that are appropriate under the ERSB rating system</b></p>
<p>For any questions regarding GamersOnline approved games
contact the marketing division email at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h3><u>FAQ</u></h3>
<p>Q: What kind of company is GamersOnline? </p>
<p>A:  GamersOnline is a
new kind of company because we are striving to achieve something that has never
been created before. In whole GamersOnline is a technology company that focuses
primarily on gaming distribution, but will bring along brand new innovate
products that will advance the gaming experience to a whole new level.  </p>
<p>Q: If GamersOnline is a gaming distribution company then why
create a controller? </p>
<p>A: The console has been around for such a long time that we
realize people aren’t just going to quite let go of the concept. We still want
to give you the console like feeling by giving you the opportunity to play any
game on our gaming application using our controller. </p>
<p>Q: What other ways does GamersOnline intend on expanding and
enhancing the gaming experience?</p>
<p>A: By allowing consumers easier access to a much larger
magnitude of games we will also assist in taking out expensive hardware
requirements of gaming and allowing for a better and smoother gaming
experience.</p>
<p>Q: What is your console? </p>
<p>A: We have no physical console; the console is whatever
device you decide to play your game on. Our application is our virtual console
that we’ll be providing on your device. </p>
<p>Q: How do we differ from other companies that have attempted
to stream games?</p>
<p>A: By 100% streaming games, you are being deprived
from quality gaming such as poor bandwidth speed. With our concept at
GamersOnline, 50% of the game will already be on our gaming application. You
will instantly be able to play. While your enjoying your game, the rest of it
will be streamed in the background allowing for a powerful gaming experience.</p>
<p>Q: What
are some of the challenges that arise with a project like this?</p>
<p>A: The
main framework of the project lies in the technological development of the
concept. GamersOnline aims to do something that hasn’t quite been done
efficiently yet, and for that exact reason great minds were brought along to
make this concept a reality.</p>
<p>Q: How
do you think GamersOnline will affect the rest of the gaming industry?</p>
<p>A: From
a gamer’s standpoint it would be reasonable to presume that other innovate
projects will arise, further asserting that gamers are multiple steps closer to
having their wildest gaming fantasies come true.</p>
<p>Q: Why
move away from the console?</p>
<p>A: To
add flexibility and more convenience to the gaming experience. GamersOnline is
taking the concept behind the wireless controller and then taking it one step
further. You still have your console; this time around it is just your own
personal device that you can take anywhere.  </p>
<p>Q: What
can a gamer expect from GamersOnline in the future?</p>
<p>A: We
can’t say too much just quite yet, but we assure our gaming community that we
are constantly coming up with innovate ideas, which are in development, that
will bring certain aspects of gaming that have yet to be seen. </p>

FAQ
Q: What kind of company is GamersOnline? 
A:  GamersOnline is a
new kind of company because we are striving to achieve something that has never
been created before. In whole GamersOnline is a technology company that focuses
primarily on gaming distribution, but will bring along brand new innovate
products that will advance the gaming experience to a whole new level.  
Q: If GamersOnline is a gaming distribution company then why
create a controller? 
A: The console has been around for such a long time that we
realize people aren’t just going to quite let go of the concept. We still want
to give you the console like feeling by giving you the opportunity to play any
game on our gaming application using our controller. 
Q: What other ways does GamersOnline intend on expanding and
enhancing the gaming experience?
A: By allowing consumers easier access to a much larger
magnitude of games we will also assist in taking out expensive hardware
requirements of gaming and allowing for a better and smoother gaming
experience.
Q: What is your console? 
A: We have no physical console; the console is whatever
device you decide to play your game on. Our application is our virtual console
that we’ll be providing on your device. 
Q: How do we differ from other companies that have attempted
to stream games?
A: By 100% streaming games, you are being deprived
from quality gaming such as poor bandwidth speed. With our concept at
GamersOnline, 50% of the game will already be on our gaming application. You
will instantly be able to play. While your enjoying your game, the rest of it
will be streamed in the background allowing for a powerful gaming experience.
Q: What
are some of the challenges that arise with a project like this?
A: The
main framework of the project lies in the technological development of the
concept. GamersOnline aims to do something that hasn’t quite been done
efficiently yet, and for that exact reason great minds were brought along to
make this concept a reality.
Q: How
do you think GamersOnline will affect the rest of the gaming industry?
A: From
a gamer’s standpoint it would be reasonable to presume that other innovate
projects will arise, further asserting that gamers are multiple steps closer to
having their wildest gaming fantasies come true.
Q: Why
move away from the console?
A: To
add flexibility and more convenience to the gaming experience. GamersOnline is
taking the concept behind the wireless controller and then taking it one step
further. You still have your console; this time around it is just your own
personal device that you can take anywhere.  
Q: What
can a gamer expect from GamersOnline in the future?
A: We
can’t say too much just quite yet, but we assure our gaming community that we
are constantly coming up with innovate ideas, which are in development, that
will bring certain aspects of gaming that have yet to be seen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tennis is an amazing game requiring a unique combination of physical and mental skills that can take years to perfect. The combination of hitting, running, and decision-making, make tennis one of the hardest sports to play. As an individual sport, players are required to become totally self-reliant; depending on themselves, exclusively, and their own efforts. Unfortunately, due to these high demands, many players leave the sport before they ever experience the many benefits tennis has to offer. Fear and intimidation are turning children away from the sport in record numbers to pursue sports they believe to be more ""fun"" or simply to be with their friends.</p>
<p>Our goal with the American Youth Tennis Association is to encourage a sense of 'Community', typically not found in tennis, in addition to player development by abandoning the lesson/tournament model and replacing it with the 'Team Sports' model. This combination of self-reliance partnered with teamwork produces a more well-rounded person as well as a more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Within the parameters of the TEAM concept, players are required to cooperate; a skill not learned in isolation. Players learn responsibility and accountability because there are others depending on them. Players learn to persevere and to support their teammates when they may be going through some difficulty. Players learn respect for the rules and for authority because their Coach, and a Referee, are always present. These and much more are learned while participating in sports other than tennis. And as such, tennis players tend to become self-centered, cynical, intolerant of others mistakes, and unable to cooperate. We're out to change all of that. Four teams at a time!</p>
<p>Over the past year and a half we've been sharing our unique style of youth tennis with the children in Palm Springs, FL and the surrounding communities.  But it's time to share it with all of Florida and America. From team uniforms, to Coaches, to Referees, to Team and individual awards, to the Playoffs and field trips, children love playing here. In fact, over the past 5 seasons, and out of the 90 players who have participated in our Youth Tennis League, 71 have played multiple Seasons. That's a 79% retention rate! We must be doing something right.</p>
<p>We believe more children would perticipate/benefit from tennis if it were marketed properly. And by that we mean Team Tennis. There's a pride in being part of the Team. Simply putting on the uniform can boost a child's confidence. The lack of which can make a child feel like an outsider. And nobody wants that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $16,000 to seed the project. This money would include trademark registrations, billboard and bus bench advertising, trade show booth setups, capital improvements, uniform upgrades, as well as Referee/Coach/P&amp;R Department  recruiting efforts, among other things.</p>
<p>But the American Youth Tennis Association is only the beginning. As Team Tennis begins to grab hold of the American conscience, the next logical step would be to produce a Professional Tennis League, similar to the NBA... but for tennis. Imagine being a part of the next great wave of tennis in America. Imagine seeing as many kids on the tennis court as on the basketball court. Imagine children wearing the jersey of their favorite tennis team/player. Imagine cheering for the Home Town Tennis team... more than once a year. More on that later.</p>
<p>Anything less than the stated goal will be directed towards efforts to expand the League, locally. Everything helps as we continue to share the message of tennis as a Team Sport. And for your contribution of $175 or more you will reveive your very own, custom-made jersey of your favorite team with your name on the back.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Too much of America (including adults) feel like tennis is 'scary'. There are numerous reasons why people choose not to play; too difficult, too much running, can't keep the ball in play, too hot outside, etc. But there's an answer to every one of these objections, and many of them can be answered with two simple words: Team Tennis. The Team acts as a container big enough to hold players of every ability because while one player is learning, there's another one carrying them. Especially when dealing with children, if there isn't some sort of success early on, children become discouraged and quit. But they can't tell you why they don't want to do it anymore. They simply say 'It's boring' or 'I don't like it'.</p>
<p>But we have witnessed, first hand, the transformation of players on the tennis court because of the support structure of the Team. When they fall, there's someone there to pick them up. Having a bad day isn't so bad when your friends are there to help you forget about it.</p>
<p>We have done ""exhaustive"" research and have discovered that children often do not play a sport for the 'Love' of the game, but for other things like friends, the uniform, or because their parents are making them play. Regardless of the reason, the emphasis in tennis has always been about Winning. So lessons are required and tournaments are the only place to get ranking points. Tennis has never been about Fun, for children, but rather player development. I guess the thinking is ""If they are good, they'll have fun"". That is backwards. We have discovered ""If they are having fun, they'll play better.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every great Sports League thrives on the 'cool' factor. So be sure to tell everyone you know about the Youth Tennis League in Palm Springs, FL. Let them know that there IS an alternative to boring lessons and scary tournaments. Kids need friends. And the American Youth Tennis Association is here to rescue kids from bad tennis.</p>

They patrol the skies and the streets... and they control who lives or dies. <b>UniTech, </b>the biggest of the corporations, owns or directly controls more than 60% of the world's economy. They have established a government-like entity with a military and fleet of combat-ready spacecraft in order to police the band of squabbling corporations. </p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Humanity is desperate to escape and UniTech is going to provide that escape. The Centration expedition is a corporate-funded endeavour to colonize the moon of a gas giant in the Keplar-16 solar system. Preliminary probe scanning has proven it to be capable of sustaining human life, and the moon will provide a perfect starting point for a human colony in a new solar system. </p><p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The launch of the expedition goes well, as UniTech forces arrive and set up space stations and habitation modules in orbit while the company investigates the surface properly.</p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A Typical Game</span></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><b>You start a game of Centration </b>when everything is swell and dandy.

They might be tasked with sabotaging the station, stealing some chemical or important data, or they might just be causing havoc for the sake of entertainment.</p><p>The station's security will naturally try to keep order, protect the crew, while the engineers will keep the station functioning.

A quiet shift where you don't even realise something's gone wrong until it's all done and over with. A crazy shift culminating in the death of the entire crew. A really long shift where everything goes wrong, and you and your crew try your hardest to keep on top of everything and it just seems never ending... then comes the conclusion period. The end of your little story. Have you survived this long? Will you survive to the end? There's a shuttle on its way to rescue you.

Players take on the role of a member of crew on board a space station in a solar system far from our own. Your goal is to survive with your fellow crew to the end of your shift.Easy job, you might say? You couldn't be more wrong. Centration throws every obstacle imaginable at you - the environment, the cold vacuum of space, explosions, gasses, side objectives, and of course, other players. You have the state-of-the-art tools of the trade at your disposal, you have an entire space station to explore and vandalise in whatever way you see fit. You could spend your shift sitting in your office wiling away the hours playing a little bit of SpaceTag with your fellow crew on the station computers; or you could spend it sprinting through the corridors of the station, attempting to escape inevitable death from one of the many forms in which it will come.The StoryCentration is set in 2152, where after centuries of development and growth, corporate entities have essentially taken control of humanity. They patrol the skies and the streets... and they control who lives or dies. UniTech, the biggest of the corporations, owns or directly controls more than 60% of the world's economy. They have established a government-like entity with a military and fleet of combat-ready spacecraft in order to police the band of squabbling corporations. Humanity is desperate to escape and UniTech is going to provide that escape. The Centration expedition is a corporate-funded endeavour to colonize the moon of a gas giant in the Keplar-16 solar system. Preliminary probe scanning has proven it to be capable of sustaining human life, and the moon will provide a perfect starting point for a human colony in a new solar system. The launch of the expedition goes well, as UniTech forces arrive and set up space stations and habitation modules in orbit while the company investigates the surface properly.A Typical GameYou start a game of Centration when everything is swell and dandy. Nothing in the world could go wrong on such a beautiful day in outer space, right? Wrong.You're a crew member on board one of the state-of-the-art space stations in the Keplar-16 solar system, on a mission of vital importance to UniTech. You have duties to carry out, whether you're an engineer or a medical technician. You'll go about doing what you need to do to make sure the space station stays in working order. The calm before the storm.Sooner or later, someone inevitably breaks something. Someone might have a mission to kill you, or one of your crew. They might be tasked with sabotaging the station, stealing some chemical or important data, or they might just be causing havoc for the sake of entertainment.The station's security will naturally try to keep order, protect the crew, while the engineers will keep the station functioning. The medics will heal and the officers will lead. The storm. Centration is played your way, and what happens during a round will differ massively from one to the next. A quiet shift where you don't even realise something's gone wrong until it's all done and over with. A crazy shift culminating in the death of the entire crew. A really long shift where everything goes wrong, and you and your crew try your hardest to keep on top of everything and it just seems never ending... then comes the conclusion period. The end of your little story. Have you survived this long? Will you survive to the end? There's a shuttle on its way to rescue you. There are escape pods, space suits, and there's also death. The shift ends when everyone is dead, the time limit is reached, everyone has left the station permanently (shuttle or escape pods), or the antagonist has successfully fulfilled all of his/her objectives.Features at a GlanceA first-person survival horror sandbox, Centration delivers some of the most dynamic features you've ever seen in a computer game. 

Airflow that flows around the station, providing you with that vital air... or maybe poison? 

Electric Systems that power every bit of machinery you operate

Scripting that controls the machinery

Realistic Physics (Yes, that includes explosive decompressions.)

Combat - Brutal, visceral, and most of all... dangerous. Centration isn't about face-paced, in-your-face combat. There's no running and gunning. It's not an shoot 'em up. It's a battle for survival. Everything is a weapon, with limitless potential for creativity.

Health - You can bleed, suffocate, burn, get poisoned, and break. 

Computing - Keep an eye on vital statistics and information, send interdepartmental messages, or just browse Facebook.

Multiplayer Round-Based - You play online with dozens of others, in rounds that could last from 5 minutes to 5 hours. 

Fully interactive environment - If you can see it, you can interact with it. Don't like that table? Move it. Don't like that console? Re-install it. Don't like that crew-member? Eject them. Don't like that window? Break it. You get the picture.

Persistent character statistics - grow your character over time, increase your competency, earn credits, evolve.

Computers to do everything from play games to browsing the web.. all from in-game. What better way to pass the time than browse reddit or youtube while your fellow crew-mates kill each other off?

Science! Perform amazing scientific experiments with the help of your friends, mix chemicals together and discover the potentially explosive results or see what happens when you feed antimatter to a monkey. (Hint: It doesn't go well for the monkey.)

<p>Most respectfully, I draw your kind attention to the fact that I am<strong> ANWESHA MISHRA  </strong>from <strong>INDIA (State of ODISHA) </strong>a ten years old girl and an<strong> Internationally rated Chess Player</strong>. I started playing chess in the year 2008 at the age of 6. After a short period, I made my debut in the Under-7 State Championship in the year 2009 and stood <strong>2nd</strong> and qualified for the National Under-7 Championship 2009 where I stood 10th in the merit list. Last year, I participated in the KIIT Cup International Grandmaster Chess Championship 2011 and made a remarkable performance by playing 11 rounds against rated opponents and achieving my Elo rating of <strong>1583 in one go, which was the highest in the country in my age group</strong>. I was also awarded the <strong>best Under-9 girl</strong> participant from the State in the KIIT Cup. During 2011, I also became <strong>Champion</strong> in the Under-9 State Championship leaving behind some of the renowned players like the Asian and World Under-8 silver medallists who had also participated. By virtue of this State Championship, I qualified to participate in the Under-9 National Chess Championship 2011. In the Under-9 National Chess Championship 2011, I was the <strong>Top Seed</strong> in the tournament. I came out with flying colours by becoming the <strong>Runners-Up</strong> (2<sup>nd</sup>) in the Under-9 National Chess Championship 2011 by beating renowned players of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharastra &amp; Goa. All these achievements have been garnered by me from a very early stage of my life.</p>
<p>                        Unfortunately, a player of my calibre has only participated in not more than 8 major tournaments in my entire career. In the few tournaments that I have played, I have achieved astounding results, some of which have been mentioned above. Despite my financial hardship and limited resources that was provided to me by my parents, I have made the best use of my talent and has come out with flying colours without any professional coaching. I require skilled and specialized training and regular tournament exposure in India and abroad. Though there are professional GM trainers in India and abroad, their fees are far too expensive. GM trainer in India charges a sum of around Rs 4,000 INR per day. Further, the entry fee for the norm tournaments in India are near about Rs 10,000 INR and expenditures are even more when played outside India as it includes airfare and boarding and an expensive entry fee.</p>
<p>                        Further it is pertinent to mention that I have been selected automatically being the runners up of National Under – 9, 2011 to represent India in the <strong>Asian</strong> Youth Championship at Sri Lanka during June, 2012 and <strong>World</strong> Youth Championship at Slovenia during November, 2012 from Odisha. It is very vital to mention here that I have participated in the recently concluded ASIAN YOUTH CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP 2012 AT SRILANKA (24<sup>th</sup> June to 2<sup>nd</sup> July, 2012) and AWARDED WITH A GOLD MEDAL FOR INDIA.THIS IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT IN CHESS (<strong>Copy of All Details Uploaded</strong>). Now I am preparing hard myself for the WORLD YOUTH CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP, 2012 AT MARIBOR, SLOVENIA FROM 07<sup>TH</sup> NOV. 2012 TO 19<sup>TH</sup> NOV. 2012. It is humbly submitted that most of the talented players have sponsors behind them. I have none to back me up for these prestigious Championships.</p>
<p>Below are the estimated expenditure details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rs 3.50 LAKHS INR(6,278 USD)</strong>  - <strong>Towards</strong> <strong>Participation</strong> in World Youth Chess, 2012 at Slovenia which includes reg.fee,entry fee,visa charges,air fares,transportation,boarding and lodging etc.for me and one accompanying person. From 4.11 2012 to 22.11.2012.</li>

</ul></div>","My Story
Most respectfully, I draw your kind attention to the fact that I am ANWESHA MISHRA  from INDIA (State of ODISHA) a ten years old girl and an Internationally rated Chess Player. I started playing chess in the year 2008 at the age of 6. After a short period, I made my debut in the Under-7 State Championship in the year 2009 and stood 2nd and qualified for the National Under-7 Championship 2009 where I stood 10th in the merit list. Last year, I participated in the KIIT Cup International Grandmaster Chess Championship 2011 and made a remarkable performance by playing 11 rounds against rated opponents and achieving my Elo rating of 1583 in one go, which was the highest in the country in my age group. I was also awarded the best Under-9 girl participant from the State in the KIIT Cup. During 2011, I also became Champion in the Under-9 State Championship leaving behind some of the renowned players like the Asian and World Under-8 silver medallists who had also participated. By virtue of this State Championship, I qualified to participate in the Under-9 National Chess Championship 2011. In the Under-9 National Chess Championship 2011, I was the Top Seed in the tournament. I came out with flying colours by becoming the Runners-Up (2nd) in the Under-9 National Chess Championship 2011 by beating renowned players of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharastra & Goa. All these achievements have been garnered by me from a very early stage of my life.
                        Unfortunately, a player of my calibre has only participated in not more than 8 major tournaments in my entire career. In the few tournaments that I have played, I have achieved astounding results, some of which have been mentioned above. Despite my financial hardship and limited resources that was provided to me by my parents, I have made the best use of my talent and has come out with flying colours without any professional coaching. I require skilled and specialized training and regular tournament exposure in India and abroad. Though there are professional GM trainers in India and abroad, their fees are far too expensive. GM trainer in India charges a sum of around Rs 4,000 INR per day. Further, the entry fee for the norm tournaments in India are near about Rs 10,000 INR and expenditures are even more when played outside India as it includes airfare and boarding and an expensive entry fee.
                        Further it is pertinent to mention that I have been selected automatically being the runners up of National Under – 9, 2011 to represent India in the Asian Youth Championship at Sri Lanka during June, 2012 and World Youth Championship at Slovenia during November, 2012 from Odisha. It is very vital to mention here that I have participated in the recently concluded ASIAN YOUTH CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP 2012 AT SRILANKA (24th June to 2nd July, 2012) and AWARDED WITH A GOLD MEDAL FOR INDIA.THIS IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST ACHIEVEMENT IN CHESS (Copy of All Details Uploaded). Now I am preparing hard myself for the WORLD YOUTH CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP, 2012 AT MARIBOR, SLOVENIA FROM 07TH NOV. 2012 TO 19TH NOV. 2012. It is humbly submitted that most of the talented players have sponsors behind them. I have none to back me up for these prestigious Championships.
Below are the estimated expenditure details:


Rs 3.50 LAKHS INR(6,278 USD)  - Towards Participation in World Youth Chess, 2012 at Slovenia which includes reg.fee,entry fee,visa charges,air fares,transportation,boarding and lodging etc.for me and one accompanying person. From 4.11 2012 to 22.11.2012.

Rs 3 LAKHS INR(5,381 USD) -  Towards Coaching which includes online coaching, personal coaching, and group coaching throughout the whole year by top level chess Grand Masters and coaching centres to realize my dream.
Arrangement of fund details by my father:


Rs 80000 INR (1435 USD) from his own savings and some amount from relatives. It is pertinent to mention that he had taken me to SRILANKA for Asian Youth Chess Championship, 2012(June21st to July, 2012) recently and almost exhausted his savings. Two costly trips within same year is actually beyond his capacity as a single earning member of the family.

Rs 70000 INR (1256 USD) through local sponsors and good wishers.                       
What We Need & What You Get
It is humbly requested that a minimum fund of 7000 USD (Rs 3.9 Lakhs approx.) in form of financial aid is indispensable for the above enumerated purpose. It is to bring to your kind notice that this huge amount is beyond the capacity for me and my family to gather.
This much needed fund will certainly help me in sharpening my chess acumen, understanding, skill, strategy and most importantly providing me with the much needed experience and exposure. I envisage a bright future and am sure to excel in the national and the international arena and bring glory to my country. Hence, I sincerely appeal here for Financial Help to make it possible for me to represent India in World Youth Chess Championship, 2012 and to achieve my long cherished dream as well as goal.

<p><strong>This project is about bringing to market the most awesome gaming guns yet realized.</strong>  </p>
<p>What makes these guns so awesome is not only how they look and feel, but how they actually inter-operate within a game.</p>
<p>These guns are PC compatible and are primarily designed to work with first person shooter PC games such as Battlefield 2 &amp; 3, Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Crysis and even games like Doom...</p>
<p>How the gun works is by emulating a keyboard and mouse as far as the game is concerned.  Normally, when you move a mouse around in a game, you can only shoot at the center of the screen and have to target the enemy dead center before firing.</p>
<p>With our gaming guns, all that is history.  You simply point the gun directly at the target and fire.  Our software and electronics reads what you are doing with the gun and automatically adjusts the mouse position and fires your shot.  If you miss, its because you actually missed the shot.  </p>
<p><strong>Great marksman and reflex training at the same time!</strong></p>
<p>These guns work with our 5D projection system, as well as regular wall projectors as well as 3D and 2D TV system and computer monitors.</p>
<p>Our 5D system (also referred to as i3D) fills the room up with the gaming world wall to wall , ceiling to floor and puts you INSIDE the environment similar to the  holodeck found in Star Trek which was one of the inspirations of the project.</p>
<p>Our guns have a laser targeting system for use with a 5D setup or a 2D large wall projector setup allowing you to fire precise point and shoot shots in all of these games which is otherwise impossible without our software.</p>
<p>For smaller TV sets and monitors, the guns operate similar to a Wii gun except that they are PC, Wii, Android and iOS (plugged into a projector) compatible but with more calibration options than any Wii gun.</p>
<p>We built prototypes and set up two demo locations in Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>The prototypes were built using NERF gun parts and BUZZBEE gun parts.  We attempted to license the NERF design with Hasbro - but the discussion reached no firm conclusion.  We then decided to build our own design inspired by a range of weapons found in actual games.</strong></p>
<p>Our design for mass production is shown here:</p>

<p>Support us at $55 or above, and you will get one of these awesome blasters at a fraction of the retail price.</p>
<p>And the color scheme of the gun will be similar to this one (although not the design):</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We now need to bring the product to mass market and you can be a pivotal part in that.</p>
<p><strong>We need to complete the initial mold and gun parts.<br/>We need to finalize the electronics and software.<br/>We need to finalize packaging.<br/>We need to get the first batch of guns (2000 or so) in stock.<br/>We need to do a TV infomercial.<br/>We need to launch the product.</strong> </p>
<p>We anticipate about 1500 of this 2000 gun batch will go to the backers making this a phenomenal win-win deal.</p>
<p><strong>IF WE RECEIVE OVER THE ASKING AMOUNT FROM PEOPLE WHO WANT GUNS,  WE'LL SIMPLY PLACE A BIGGER ORDER WITH THE MANUFACTURER!</strong></p>
<p>Be part of this new gaming era and be recognized as such. </p>
<p><strong>----------------------------------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>The guns are designed to work with computer monitors, TV sets (plasma, DLP, CRT, LCD, OLED..) and projector setups.  They are also excellent accessories for our 5D gaming and theater set up.</strong></p>
<p>To recap, the guns are primarily designed for PC based games.  They will also work with the Wii.  They CAN also work with the Playstation 3 and XBOX 360 if we can get agreements with Sony and Microsoft in place.  The guns will also work with an ipad game and an android game and even the upcoming ooya gaming system and any system that uses bluetooth or can have bluetooth added.</p>

<p>Three years ago I have started this project more as a learning exercise for my programming skills. I worked on it whenever I found some free time, and I enjoyed it. As time went by, the project started to grow and look more like a fully working game.</p>
<p>It is now almost finished, I estimate it is 75% done, however there are some things that need to be done and which I cannot do by myself, as I am only good with programming and somewhat good with design.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The goal</h3>
<p>Phiara is designed as a free online space exploring browser game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That means that the game can be played in any browser, on any resolution and any hardware.</p>
<p>It is based around an online community, and the game is focused around exploration, social interaction and sharing experiences. There are no battles to be fought or empires to build, like so many other games in this niche.</p>
<p>The game will always be free and available for everyone in the world.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is needed &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>I need some funds to finish some parts of the game that I kept postponing for some time now because of lack of money. The game needs new graphic elements to be designed or the existing ones to be updated. For this I need a graphic designer. I have worked with a team in the past and they did a wonderful job, however it was not cheap.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The game now has it's own domain name and hosting plan for which I payed myself. However, the expiration date for these is arriving soon.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Since the game is multiplatform, it needs to be tested on a wide spectrum of available hardware.</p>
<p>I have already optimized it for PCs, laptops and netbooks, iPhones and iPads. However, I don't have an Android platform, and I would like to invest in a Android smartphone for further optimisation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I plan to create an iPhone app and a Android app for the game, so it can be accessed this way too. However, to become a iPhone developer you need to pay Apple a fee.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>No mater what your donation amount is, you'll be mentioned in the credits of the game with a big thank you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Any donation amount is more then welcome, however if you want to support this project you can sign-up for the Beta testing, and provide feedback.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<div>
<p>Monster RPG 2 is a fairly successful JRPG for PC, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. But it can be so much more! I am seeking funding that will allow me to not only open source the game engine and all of its data, but also help developers create games using this engine by 1) Offering contributors 1 on 1 help via email, IRC and any other form of communication accessible to me, and 2) Create a massive development wiki which will have information on the codebase and data formats used to personalize a game of your own. For 3 months I will be at the mercy of my contributors, fixing bugs and adding features to make this engine general purpose and easy for coders to create their dream games with. And plus, anyone in the world will be able to download Monster RPG 2 for free!</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this game free and open, I need to keep my server running, development fees paid and enough left over to continue developing new games. My server costs about $40/mo and I need $99 annually for an iOS development license. I calculate $40/mo and $99/yr to be $1160 over two years. I estimate that perks will cost me several hundred dollars, and it's inevitable that I will need some money to continue working on Baryon (which you get with $5 and up contributions) which is why I'm asking for $1500.</p>
<p>I'm offering some really unique perks. I'll be your personal coding machine for 2 weeks for $50, for example.</p>

<div>
<h3>New perk: Get access to our latest game as we develop it!</h3>
<p>I'm very happy to announce a new $5 perk in this campaign. It's a doozy. You'll get alpha access (EDIT: AT LEAST monthly builds, sometimes more often) to our ""top-secret"" in-development game we've code-named Baryon (plus the full version when it's ready)! It's in the ""early"" (not EARLY EARLY) stages and it's going to be fantastic. Estimated time of delivery is December 1st so we can polish it up for you guys some more.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world needs more open source games! But that doesn't mean YOUR game has to be open source. You will be free to choose whatever license you want for the Monster RPG 2 engine and assets, thanks to it being released under the <a href=""http://www.nooskewl.com/content/official-license-post"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Give it Your Own License, License</a>. Like free software? Release your game under the GPL. Or perhaps you want to make a commercial game? That's ok too!</p>
<p>But this campaign isn't only about developers. Every single person out there will gain access to the full version of Monster RPG 2 from the App Store, direct from our site, or from one of the many other distributors the game is available from now. So by making a pledge, you're investing in free copies of the game for all of your friends and family, too.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are a large number of people that really enjoy classic style JRPGs, and there are very few good ones available freely. Get the word out to your friends about this campaign! Any pledge is super-appreciated by me. On an end note, this game was once free for a day on the iTunes App Store. It received over 10 thousand downloads that day. For $1500, the game could be downloaded tens of thousands more times for free!</p>
<p>This campaign really has two goals. Spread a great game to as many people as possible for free, and help developers make great games of their own by improving the engine over the course of 3 months, even adding custom features specifically designed by contributors. My love for this game means I will continue to support it (though may not have as much time) beyond 90 days. APPEND: And now there's a third goal: get some new eyes on our in-development action RPG, Baryon!</p>
<p>Please note: I will provide all the support I can for developers, but I recommend a good knowledge of C++ and programming in general if you wish to take advantage of the developer perks! Please also note that this game uses version 5.1 of the Allegro game programming library.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>My goal with this fundraiser is to make enough money to tide me over until my team's next project (Baryon) is finished. Therefore, anything above the $1,500 goal will go to charity (PAOS - the same charity as the CD sales goes to.) If the campaign reaches over $1,600, I'll post a personal thank you video, because this charity is very special to me! I'm not very good in front of cameras, so this is a BIG DEAL for me! :)</p>

</div><p>Hi. My name is Mat Campbell-Hill and I am a wheelchair
athlete for Great Britain. In 2009 a spinal injury left me bed ridden and meant
that I was forced to stop work and my sporty lifestyle. I was told I would never get back to any normal life and to <i>'mourn the life I lost'</i>, but I don't give up easily and over the following two years I was able to improve
my muscle tone around the affected areas so that I could walk short distances
with a stick. This physiotherapy eventually led me to the Paralympic version of
my previous sport and, in 2011, I started Wheelchair Fencing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not have time to prepare and qualify
for London 2012 but I am now well on my way internationally with <b>top ten finishes
and two Bronze Medals at World Cup level</b>. My success is in no small part due to
my commitment to a full time training programme and the support of one of the
best fencing clubs in the Europe - Truro Fencing Club.</p>
<p>At Truro, not only do I get to train alongside current GB
and international Olympic Athletes, but I also have the support of previous
Olympic and Paralympic coaches and the wider support staff ensuring my programme is
professional and of the highest standard.</p>
<p>Sadly, in January of this year UKSport decided to withdraw
funding for Wheelchair Fencing. Without external funding I have zero chance of fulfilling my potential to keep winning medals and improving, or of qualifying for Rio! We have
exhausted all of our personal funds to get me to this point and now I need
external support to help me get there. This is where you come in.</p>
<p>By buying one of these perks, not only will you be getting
involved in international sport, AND getting yourself some <b>fantastic limited
edition stash</b>, but you will be helping me continue my qualification to Rio and
potentially of getting my medal in 2016. Imagine: sitting watching the medal
ceremonies with your friends and family and being able to say - <i>""I made
that happen! I'm part of that team!""</i></p>
<p>For Silver Friend and above, if you are a youth-focused or
disability organisation, for example a school or youth club, and would wish to
receive more regular updates, for example to help with a term or year-long

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A game that makes typing fun, Rally Typer combines the traditional and widely beloved race kart genre with a typing speed competition. The way it works is simple: you type out a pre-set text on your keyboard, aiming for perfect accuracy and exceptional speed. The faster and more accurate that you are, the better that you will do in the race. This is a browser-based game, so you don't need any peripheral hardware to play it. The graphics are cartoony and 3D, and the gameplay itself is extremely exciting, turning the simple act of typing into something frenetic and competitive.</p>
<p>When you type well in Rally Typer, you earn a turbo boost, and the ""keyboard"" boxes contain other weapons and boosts that will come in handy during gameplay. You can connect with your friends for social play, collect in-game currency for new karts and other upgrades, and display your kart collection in your virtual garage. Everything about Rally Typer emphasizes fast typing and frantic racing, and to make this game a reality, we are turning to you.</p>
<p><br/>Check out the demo at <a href=""http://www.rallytyper.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rallytyper.com</a><br/><br/>This is just a demo, with your help we want to make the game play even better!</p>

</h1><h1><b>What
is War Elephant Racing?</b></h1>
<p>War Elephant Racing is put together
by a Father and Son team for your enjoyment. War Elephant Racing first started
out as a way for Dad to show his son how to take his artful ideas and turn them
into something physical. Why stop at a sketch or a single concept when you can
explore ideas and turn them into something even more? The team built a small
little world to play in. The two have been working on other games behind the
scenes of fun and craziness but wanted to present War Elephant Racing to the
public first with more games to follow. <br/></p><p>You can read more about use here at our website. <a href=""http://www.xhaostheory.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click Here.</a><br/></p>

<b>War Elephant Racing </b>(W.E.R.) is a <b>fast paced game of chance and skill</b>. War
elephants will be <b>bumping </b>and <b>crashing </b>into each other on a tight course
sending the others into a spin that will cost them crucial game points. Players
must carefully <b>balance </b>a number of objectives, be <b>quick </b>with reactions, and
<b>recognize </b>all of the scoring combinations to be able to beat their opponent. It
is a game where <b>experience</b> counts for a great deal although a <b>little bit of
luck </b>always helps. <b>New and young players</b> will be able to jump in fairly quickly
and give the vets a run for their money.<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/425926/files/20140311051751-IMG_1197small.png?1394540271"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>War Elephant Racing</b> uses <b>Xhaos cards</b> to spice up the race and increase the
competitive action. <b>Xhaos cards are special cards </b>that call upon a special
ability of an elephant of renown to give the players <b>huge advantages</b> to use
against their <b>competition</b>. Special timing will provide the players with <b>an edge</b>
over the other war elephant racers.<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/425927/files/20140311051820-IMG_1198small.png?1394540300"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

What
is War Elephant Racing?
War Elephant Racing is put together
by a Father and Son team for your enjoyment. War Elephant Racing first started
out as a way for Dad to show his son how to take his artful ideas and turn them
into something physical. Why stop at a sketch or a single concept when you can
explore ideas and turn them into something even more? The team built a small
little world to play in. The two have been working on other games behind the
scenes of fun and craziness but wanted to present War Elephant Racing to the
public first with more games to follow. You can read more about use here at our website. Click Here.
What do you get when you mix Chaos,
Cribbage, and Carnage and more fun than a sack of nuts?War Elephant Racing!

Players : 2-4

Ages : 12+

Time to Play : 20 - 60 Minutes (for 4 player)

Type of Game: Card and Board game


Crowd for Game: Everyone !

Family Fun game for the kids to play and helps teach them math, reading, communication and pattern recognizing skills. The young ones pick up real quick and have a great time racing around with their War Elephant.Beer & Pretzels: Very fun and competitive for Adults, we have played many late nights. always having good laughs and good times.  The close races and the Xhaos cards are fun for ""messing with your buddies"" while consuming cocktails. Never a dull moment.
War Elephant Racing (W.E.R.) is a fast paced game of chance and skill. War
elephants will be bumping and crashing into each other on a tight course
sending the others into a spin that will cost them crucial game points. Players
must carefully balance a number of objectives, be quick with reactions, and
recognize all of the scoring combinations to be able to beat their opponent. It
is a game where experience counts for a great deal although a little bit of
luck always helps. New and young players will be able to jump in fairly quickly
and give the vets a run for their money.War Elephant Racing uses Xhaos cards to spice up the race and increase the
competitive action. Xhaos cards are special cards that call upon a special
ability of an elephant of renown to give the players huge advantages to use
against their competition. Special timing will provide the players with an edge
over the other war elephant racers.
The funds that are raised through
this program will allow us to purchase more art supplies and programs for
our future projects. If this takes off to crazy levels we will be able to purchase
bulk quantities of the game for us to attempt to possibly get War Elephant
Racing into stores.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Martijn Straatman. I'm a Creative Designer for websites, web ui's etc. Almost 5 years ago my son was born... with Cystic Fibrosis. A not cureable decise and sometimes deadly.</p>
<p>To help raise funds i designed a game that helps patients excersise their lung function and is fun to play for non-patients. The story is simple but the gameplay will help them: they have to blow to make bubbles and fight dragons and bees. The hader the blow, the bubble has more effect on obstacles. Blowing is hard for CF patients. For non-patienst it is just fun to blow bubbles and play the game. Also i want to bring CF under the attention so we build in a donate button. The money we raise out of donation we give to the NCFS. This money benefits research for new medicine and how to tried the decise.</p>
<p>People with CF are expecting to life for 30 years... that means i proberly have to bury my own son. We want to raise as much money to give the children and patients a longer life. That's why we need funding. To setup the game and the in-app store to sell merchandise.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 15000 euros to set up the game and the store. Inside the store we want to sell merchandise like puppets. The funding goes directly to NCFS, they will take care of our account. People who fund us 1000 euros or more will get their name or logo inside the game as a Bubble Wizard!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Every euro we donate to the NCFS has an effect on a patienst life! This decise has an effect, not only on a patient but on a family as well. We have to tread it! This project has a large social effect as well.Let's do this together and play for air!</p>

RN Estudio: We are one of the most important paintings companies worldwide, and in a few assume another challenge, which is to bring you those miniatures, that we ourselves wanted to paint and were not in the market :)

It started at my dining-room table with some good friends, a bag of polyhedral dice, and a bottle of Mountain Dew. I created a fantasy adventure campaign that centered around a mysterious swamp dotted with barrow mounds and standing stones. A vast dungeon existed beneath the mounds. It teemed with undead and burial crypts filled with precious treasures. We had a lot of fun and I wondered if other people might be interested in Barrowmaze.</p><p>Not really knowing much about PDF publishing, I brought my home-game notes together and that became the basis of Barrowmaze I (published under the Open Gaming License and compatible with Labyrinth Lord and other classic fantasy role-playing games). However, there was still another half of the map yet to stock, so I ran a successful campaign for <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/barrowmaze-ii/x/533405"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Barrowmaze II on Indiegogo</a> that included former TSR artist Jim Holloway and brought another artist, the awesome Trevor Hammond, out of retirement. Because I love old school RPG art and gamer swag, I ran another successful campaign on Indiegogo to create some fun <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/barrowmaze-gamer-tees/x/533405"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Barrowmaze Tees</a> with the tag line ""Get Rich or Die Tryin"" which pretty much sums up the experience of the dungeon :)</p><p>Through the support of the old school gaming community, Barrrowmaze I was listed in the Top 10 on RPGnow for months and finished in Second Place for the prestigious Three Castles Game Award for RPG Design at the North Texas RPGcon last June. </p><p>Although Barrowmaze has my name on the cover, I view the adventure as a communal expression -- it speaks to the type of game we want to play, the style of game we want to forward, and that the roots of our hobby are important and worth preserving for future gamers.</p><p><b>The Plan: Barrowmaze Complete</b></p><p>Barrowmaze I and II need to be combined into one definitive volume: <u>Barrowmaze Complete</u>.

We believe the simple act of playing a game in public is where strangers can become friends. We want to bring people together and share the love of interacting, away from the office, sharing time, relaxing and having fun.Success comes when people act together, failure tends to happen alone.We live in a world where finding fault in others seems to be the favourite blood sport. It has long been the basis of politics. It is the theme of much television programming across the world. It sells newspapers. Whenever we meet anyone, our first, almost unconscious reaction may be to look for imperfections.
Shackled away, we fall prey to the constraints of work, dreaming of what we would like to be knowing full well it will never transpire. We have that strength, that passion to achieve our goal and become a better person but very few use that power.Disconnect from the online network and embrace the intrigue that exists when you meet someone you know nothing about. Who knows what you'll discover or where it may take you?

<p>This <a href=""http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/01/daily-chart-19"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infographic</a> from the Economist shows the risk of the Zika virus spreading.</p>
<p>Zika is a disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Symptoms can include mild fever, skin rashes, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, or headache. These symptoms normally last for 2-7 days. The virus is circulating in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of Zika have been linked with the autoimmune disease Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and an increase in babies born with microcephaly.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization there is no specific treatment or vaccine currently available. They recommend the best form of prevention is protection against mosquito bites.</p>
<p>While Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, sexual transmission of Zika virus has also been reported.</p>

Zika virus diagnosis can only be confirmed by laboratory testing for the presence of Zika virus RNA in the blood or other body fluids, such as urine or saliva. According to the FDA, ‘there are no commercially available diagnostic tests cleared by the FDA’. <p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457993501/aempmwqvurdzo9siyy5k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Over 10,000 athletes will compete at the Rio Olympics from 5 August to 21 August 2016 in Rio De Janiero, Brazil, center of the current Zika outbreak. Up to 500,000 more fans, officials and other supporters will also attend. 200,000 of these are expected to be from the USA.</p>
<p>While the Zika virus does not pose any major health risks directly to the people
contracting it, the downstream impact of the virus, especially on pregnant women, is worrying health officials. Testing is seen as one way of reducing the global spread of Zika post-Olympics.</p>

<p><b>1. Where do I get a test done?</b></p>
<p>We will mail you a package so you can provide a sample at your convenience. This is then sent to our laboratories where the results will be analyzed and provided to you or your physician as appropriate.</p>
<p><b>2. What countries is it available in?</b></p>
<p>Upon FDA authorization the test will initially be available only in the US, although we plan to add additional jurisdictions subject to appropriate regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><b>3. How reliable is the test?</b></p>
<p>In general, molecular diagnostic tests are some of the most accurate, sensitive and reliable tests
for viral infections like Zika. Specific data around this will be part of our FDA submission and will be made available at the time of authorization.</p>
<p><b>4. Is the test FDA approved?</b></p>
<p>Not yet. Our intention is to seek authorization for our test from the FDA through its
emergency use authorization mechanism.</p>
<p><b>5. How confident are you that the test will be authorized and available in time for
the Olympics?</b></p>
<p>We offer no guarantees that our test will be authorized or available in time for the Olympics, however we have had very promising outcomes from a validation study around Ebola. The FDA also focuses resources on emergency use authorization filings to expedite authorization of new diagnostic tests. Both factors give us reasonable confidence that our test will be authorized and available for the Olympics. </p><p><b>6.

According to the World Health Organization there is no specific treatment or vaccine currently available. They recommend the best form of prevention is protection against mosquito bites.
While Zika is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, sexual transmission of Zika virus has also been reported.

Zika virus diagnosis can only be confirmed by laboratory testing for the presence of Zika virus RNA in the blood or other body fluids, such as urine or saliva. According to the FDA, ‘there are no commercially available diagnostic tests cleared by the FDA’. 

Over 10,000 athletes will compete at the Rio Olympics from 5 August to 21 August 2016 in Rio De Janiero, Brazil, center of the current Zika outbreak. Up to 500,000 more fans, officials and other supporters will also attend. 200,000 of these are expected to be from the USA.
While the Zika virus does not pose any major health risks directly to the people
contracting it, the downstream impact of the virus, especially on pregnant women, is worrying health officials. Testing is seen as one way of reducing the global spread of Zika post-Olympics.


We will use your money to accelerate our product development program, get validation of our Zika test, and submit it to the FDA for authorization.
The more money we raise the faster we will be able to bring our Zika test through the authorization process and get it into the hands of the people that need it. 




Ubiquitome is a New Zealand-based developer of handheld, cloud connected real time PCR devices. The company’s Freedom4 is the first commercially available handheld, battery powered device to offer gold standard real-time PCR performance wherever it is needed. Visit www.ubiquitomebio.com.

The Ubiquitome team comprises top scientists and engineers in the US and New Zealand, including the inventors of the technology at Otago University, one of New Zealand’s top health research Universities. Our disciplines cover molecular biology, virology, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, optical engineering and manufacturing engineering.

1. Where do I get a test done?
We will mail you a package so you can provide a sample at your convenience. This is then sent to our laboratories where the results will be analyzed and provided to you or your physician as appropriate.
2. What countries is it available in?
Upon FDA authorization the test will initially be available only in the US, although we plan to add additional jurisdictions subject to appropriate regulatory requirements.
3. How reliable is the test?
In general, molecular diagnostic tests are some of the most accurate, sensitive and reliable tests
for viral infections like Zika. Specific data around this will be part of our FDA submission and will be made available at the time of authorization.
4. Is the test FDA approved?
Not yet. Our intention is to seek authorization for our test from the FDA through its
emergency use authorization mechanism.
5. How confident are you that the test will be authorized and available in time for
the Olympics?
We offer no guarantees that our test will be authorized or available in time for the Olympics, however we have had very promising outcomes from a validation study around Ebola. The FDA also focuses resources on emergency use authorization filings to expedite authorization of new diagnostic tests. Both factors give us reasonable confidence that our test will be authorized and available for the Olympics. 6. Can I get Ubiquitome's mobile molecular test?We plan to make the mobile molecular test based on the Freedom4 available following FDA authorization. 7. I have another really important application for the Freedom4, how can I get one for this?Follow-up with us at www.ubiquitomebio.com. Please note that the Freedom4 is an investigational use only device. Its performance characteristics have not yet been established.",18.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Kurze Zusammenfassung</b></p>Guardians of Ember ist das neue Hack'n'Slash MMO vom preisgekrönten Entwicklerstudio Runewaker (z.B. Runes of Magic oder Dragon’s Prophet).

<br/>Mit dieser Indiegogo-Kampagne könnt ihr die Übersetzung ins Deutsche unterstützen - aber selbst wenn Du keine deutsche Version benötigst, ist dies hier die beste Gelegenheit, um sich einen Steamkey für den Early Access zu schnappen und anderes, cooles Zeug (z.B. Shirt, BBQ) abzusahnen.

<ul>
<li><p>Als kleiner unabhängiger Publisher haben wir leider keine Ressourcen für mehrere Übersetzungen gleichzeitig.</p></li>
<li><p>Einige von euch haben bereits nach einer deutschen Version gefragt.</p></li>
<li><p>Zeig uns, dass Du die deutsche Version wirklich willst und unterstütze diese Indigogo-Kampagne!</p></li>
<li><p>Als Dankeschön unsererseits für deine Unterstützung haben wir einige nette Pakete zusammengeschnürt (die nicht nur das Spiel an sich beinhalten, dass Du in der englischen Version ab Dezember spielen kannst, sondern auch Shirts, Grillen mit dem GoE Team und vieles mehr!).</p></li>

<li>
<p>Aber um <span style=""background-color: initial;"">die wichtigste Frage hier zu beantworten:</span></p>
<p>Natürlich kann man mit allen Editionen den Inhalt des gesamten Spiels erleben. Wir werden Early Access mit zwei Akten und fünf Klassen starten, werden aber die weiteren Inhalte für alle Editionen verfügbar machen.<br/><br/>Darüber hinaus erhalten Spieler, die die Demigod Edition erwerben eine exklusive PvP Pose sowie die Guardian-Rüstung (reines Kostüm, keine Spielvorteile).<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472576237/y7liz8yddgpqf17bf9g7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</li>
</ul> <p><b>Die Auswirkungen</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Da das Kampagnenziel bereits erreicht ist, planen wir eine erste Version mit einem deutschen User-Interface im Januar 2017.</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Kommende Inhalte werden dann in Englisch und Deutsch veröffentlicht, sobald die deutsche Version komplett fertig ist (voraussichtlich Q2 2017).</span></p></li>
</ul> <p><b>Risiken und Herausforderungen</b></p> <ul>
<li><p>Der Testserver läuft bereits und wir testen mit frühen Backern die englische Version auf Herz und Nieren. Der Early Access-Start war am 13. Dezember 2016.</p></li>
<li><p>Da der Client bereits über die ""Sprachauswahl-Funktion"" verfügt, besteht keine technische Hürde - das Hauptrisiko ist also eine verspätete deutsche Version</p></li>
<li><p>Natürlich kannst Du <span style=""background-color: initial;"">die englische Version bereits ab Start der Early Access Phase spielen :)</span></p></li>
</ul> <p><b>Andere Möglichkeiten uns zu unterstützen</b></p>Selbst wenn Du eine englische Version bevorzugst, ist diese Kampagne für Dich interessant: W<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ir freuen uns natürlich auch, wenn Du einfach so Deinen Early Access Key via IndieGoGo kaufst um</span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> einer der ersten Spieler auf dem Server zu sein und dich an die Spitze des Rankings zu kämpfen!</span>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As a small independent publisher we simply cannot afford localizations for several languages before first revenues are coming in. </span>Several German players<span style='background-color: initial;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> asked us for a localized version as soon as possible.</span>
</li>
<li>Grab your Steamkey via this Indiegogo campaign now and support the German localization with this purchase - once we achieve the campaign goal we start the localization right away</li>
<li>As a thank you for your support we created some nice bundles (not only Steam keys for the Early Access version but you can get exclusive shirts or BBQ with the team).</li>
<li>Here you can get an overview about the planned editions: <a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/app/463680/discussions/0/355043117528807631/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GoE Packages</a>
</li>
<li>
<p>But to answer the most important question here: <br/>It will, of course, be possible to explore the same content with all three editions. Although we are launching Early Access with only two Acts and five Classes, all five Acts and all six Classes will be accessible to everyone.<br/><br/>Players who decide to get the extended Demigod edition will receive an exclusive Guardians costume plus some nice add-ons like an exclusive Title or a special PVP Victory pose.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472576237/y7liz8yddgpqf17bf9g7.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>If you buy the Immortal edition you get everything from the Demigod edition plus we add a permanent Sabretooth mount and the digital soundtrack containing more than ninety minutes of epic GoE music.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472576346/tesvdk4jfepgvdzsryps.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Due to the fact that the campaign is already reached we plan to release a version with German UI in December 2016.</li>
<li>Upcoming content will be released in English and German once the final German version is done (most likely end of Q1 2017).</li>
<li>In addition we'll release an Iron Man feature together with the Early Access launch as the campaign reached 20.000 USD.</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The test server is already running and we are heavily testing the English version at the moment. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Because the client is already multi language ready there should be no technical hurdle - t</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">he major risk is a delayed delivery of the German version (especially if the campaign goal is not met).</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">However, the Steamkeys can be used for the English version, too - even if the German version is delayed everyone can start playing once Early Access starts! :)</span></div>
<div> </div>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you prefer an English version we appreciate your support via this Indiegogo campaign - every online game depends on its community and we are happy if you join the Guardians of Ember when we launch in December: </p>
<p>If you get your key right now you have the chance to be one of the first players on the servers and fight your way to the top!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Even if you cannot afford one of our bundles right now we really appreciate if you share this campaign with your friends and guild mates!</span></p>

</div></div>","Important information: GoE has been launched into Steam Early Access on 13th December 2016. If you back our campaign now and choose a Perk with a Steam Key, we will manually email your key (check your spam-filter)! If you do not want to wait you can also buy on our website or on Steam.  

SCROLL DOWN FOR FULL ENGLISH TEXT!
 


Wichtige Info: Die englische Version von GoE ist am 13. Dezember 2016 auf Steam Early Access gestartet; die Deutsche Version ist dank der erfolgreichen Kampagne bereits in Arbeit. Wenn du uns jetzt hier unterstützt senden wir dir manuell den Steam Key und du kannst bereits die englische Version spielen!

Alternativ kannst du das Spiel auch hier auf unserer Webseite kaufen oder direkt bei Steam!

 
Kurze ZusammenfassungGuardians of Ember ist das neue Hack'n'Slash MMO vom preisgekrönten Entwicklerstudio Runewaker (z.B. Runes of Magic oder Dragon’s Prophet). Das Spiel ist aktuell auf Englisch verfügbar und mittels dieser Kampagne bereiten wir die deutsche Übersetzung vor!Alle Informationen zum Spiel könnt ihr auf unserer offiziellen Steam-Seite finden.
 
Features: - Doppel-Klassen-System (ab Level 15)
 - nahezu unendliche Charakteroptimierung (4 Rassen, 6 Klassen, über 300 aktive und passive Fähigkeiten)
- zufällig generierte Dungeons mit individuellen Schwierigkeitsgraden- Handwerk- und Verzauberungssystem: Erstelle Deine perfekte Ausrüstung- Hausbau: Dekoriere Dein eigenes Haus mit hunderten Gegenständen 

 
- Spannende Geschichte mit hunderten Aufgaben- verschiedene Spieler-gegen-Spieler Optionen (1v1, 3v3, 5v5 - freies Spiel und Ligamodus)

Mit dieser Indiegogo-Kampagne könnt ihr die Übersetzung ins Deutsche unterstützen - aber selbst wenn Du keine deutsche Version benötigst, ist dies hier die beste Gelegenheit, um sich einen Steamkey für den Early Access zu schnappen und anderes, cooles Zeug (z.B. Shirt, BBQ) abzusahnen. PS: Wenn du eine andere Größe möchtest als L oder XL kontaktiere uns bitte vor deiner Bestellung!  Was WIR brauchen und was was DU dafür bekommst

Als kleiner unabhängiger Publisher haben wir leider keine Ressourcen für mehrere Übersetzungen gleichzeitig.
Einige von euch haben bereits nach einer deutschen Version gefragt.
Zeig uns, dass Du die deutsche Version wirklich willst und unterstütze diese Indigogo-Kampagne!
Als Dankeschön unsererseits für deine Unterstützung haben wir einige nette Pakete zusammengeschnürt (die nicht nur das Spiel an sich beinhalten, dass Du in der englischen Version ab Dezember spielen kannst, sondern auch Shirts, Grillen mit dem GoE Team und vieles mehr!).
Mehr Information über die GoE-Editionen findest Du auf Steam.

Aber um die wichtigste Frage hier zu beantworten:
Natürlich kann man mit allen Editionen den Inhalt des gesamten Spiels erleben. Wir werden Early Access mit zwei Akten und fünf Klassen starten, werden aber die weiteren Inhalte für alle Editionen verfügbar machen.Darüber hinaus erhalten Spieler, die die Demigod Edition erwerben eine exklusive PvP Pose sowie die Guardian-Rüstung (reines Kostüm, keine Spielvorteile).
Wenn Du die Immortal Edition kaufst, erhältst Du alles aus der Demigod Edition plus ein permanentes Reittier, den Säbelzahntiger, sowie den digitalen Soundtrack (90 Minuten).

 Die Auswirkungen

Da das Kampagnenziel bereits erreicht ist, planen wir eine erste Version mit einem deutschen User-Interface im Januar 2017.
Kommende Inhalte werden dann in Englisch und Deutsch veröffentlicht, sobald die deutsche Version komplett fertig ist (voraussichtlich Q2 2017).
 Risiken und Herausforderungen 
Der Testserver läuft bereits und wir testen mit frühen Backern die englische Version auf Herz und Nieren. Der Early Access-Start war am 13. Dezember 2016.
Da der Client bereits über die ""Sprachauswahl-Funktion"" verfügt, besteht keine technische Hürde - das Hauptrisiko ist also eine verspätete deutsche Version
Natürlich kannst Du die englische Version bereits ab Start der Early Access Phase spielen :)
 Andere Möglichkeiten uns zu unterstützenSelbst wenn Du eine englische Version bevorzugst, ist diese Kampagne für Dich interessant: Wir freuen uns natürlich auch, wenn Du einfach so Deinen Early Access Key via IndieGoGo kaufst um einer der ersten Spieler auf dem Server zu sein und dich an die Spitze des Rankings zu kämpfen!

 Und selbst wenn Du grad nicht flüssig bist und dir ein Bundle momentan nicht leisten kannst: Erzähl einfach deinen Freunden, Arbeitskollegen oder Gildenmitglieder von uns!

Short Summary
From the award-winning development studio Runewaker (e.g. Runes of Magic and Dragon's Prophet), Guardians of Ember is Guardians of Ember is a unique combination of Hack'n'Slash and traditional MMORPG with a focus on action oriented combat in PVE and PVP as well as near endless character optimization.  
All information about the game can be found at the official Steam page.
After several technical tests (CBTs) we have launched on Steam Early Access for Europe and North America - and thanks to our stretch goal being reached we will open with our Iron Hero Event on the first weekend! Features: - dual class system (available from level 15) 

 
- near unlimited character optimization (4 races, 6 classes, over 300 of active and passive skills) 

 
- randomized dungeons with individual difficulty settings - crafting and enchanting system: Design your perfect equipment - housing system: Decorate your own house with hundreds of items 

 
- engaging story with hundreds of quests - various PVP options (1vs1, 3vs3, 5vs5 - ranked and unranked)
 This Indiegogo campaign is to support the additional German localization for the game - but even if you don't need a German (or other) language version this campaign is the right place for you to grab your Guardians of Ember key or an exclusive shirt! (Please contact us for different sizes).


What We Need & What You Get


As a small independent publisher we simply cannot afford localizations for several languages before first revenues are coming in. Several German players asked us for a localized version as soon as possible.

Grab your Steamkey via this Indiegogo campaign now and support the German localization with this purchase - once we achieve the campaign goal we start the localization right away
As a thank you for your support we created some nice bundles (not only Steam keys for the Early Access version but you can get exclusive shirts or BBQ with the team).
Here you can get an overview about the planned editions: GoE Packages


But to answer the most important question here: It will, of course, be possible to explore the same content with all three editions. Although we are launching Early Access with only two Acts and five Classes, all five Acts and all six Classes will be accessible to everyone.Players who decide to get the extended Demigod edition will receive an exclusive Guardians costume plus some nice add-ons like an exclusive Title or a special PVP Victory pose. 
If you buy the Immortal edition you get everything from the Demigod edition plus we add a permanent Sabretooth mount and the digital soundtrack containing more than ninety minutes of epic GoE music. 



The Impact

Due to the fact that the campaign is already reached we plan to release a version with German UI in December 2016.
Upcoming content will be released in English and German once the final German version is done (most likely end of Q1 2017).
In addition we'll release an Iron Man feature together with the Early Access launch as the campaign reached 20.000 USD.

 

Risks & Challenges
The test server is already running and we are heavily testing the English version at the moment. 

Because the client is already multi language ready there should be no technical hurdle - the major risk is a delayed delivery of the German version (especially if the campaign goal is not met).

However, the Steamkeys can be used for the English version, too - even if the German version is delayed everyone can start playing once Early Access starts! :)
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you prefer an English version we appreciate your support via this Indiegogo campaign - every online game depends on its community and we are happy if you join the Guardians of Ember when we launch in December: 
If you get your key right now you have the chance to be one of the first players on the servers and fight your way to the top!
Even if you cannot afford one of our bundles right now we really appreciate if you share this campaign with your friends and guild mates!

<p class=""p2"">BouncerVR is a virtual reality arcade game for PC, Mac, Linux* and Oculus Rift. The game is a tribute to games of the past. Simple to play, yet engaging and challenging. In the game, you control a shield with only your vision. With this shield you bounce a ball towards the enemy. You score a point when the enemy is unable to bounce back the ball.</p>
<p class=""p2"">You can collect various power-ups to help you reach your goal. Some power-ups speed up or resize the ball, while others change the gameplay dramatically. Play through various levels and unlock new types of power-ups in the process.</p>
<p class=""p2"">While this game is made from the ground up for the Oculus Rift virtual reality glasses, it can also be played without them by using your mouse. Playing the game in VR gives you the advantage of depth perception thus you can see the ball and power-ups coming towards you and guess their distance and speed. </p>
<p class=""p2"">I am one of those people who becomes motion sick very quickly while using the Rift. With this project I succeeded in creating a game that doesn't have this effect on me. I think this is mainly because you don't move around in the virtual world.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The game uses only your head movement as input controls. No need to fumble around with gamepads or mouse and keyboard. Just put on the rift and play.</p>

If I don't reach my campaign goal however, I will still create the base game for all the people who pledged, but it might take a little longer. I think everyone will agree this is reasonable enough.
As for the stretch goals, it is hard to put an exact date on them. I will however make sure the game receives updates frequently. This means I will release the stretch goals over the months following the release of the base game.
Back to top

The stretch goals I have currently added to the project are thought up and defined by me. I strongly believe that YOU as a player would be much better in defining stretch goals.
Because of this I have set up an 'Idea Box' in which all of you can post your suggestions, features and remarks. You can also vote other ideas up or down depending on how well you like them.
The ideas in this idea box will have an impact on the road map and feature list of the game. If an idea is possible to add to the game and you, as a crowd, think it would be better than an existing goal I will change my plans. Ultimately it will be all of you that define the future of the game.
Everyone who brings forth an idea that I eventually use, will be mentioned in the credits of the game.

* Not all ideas will be accepted. Ideas need to be both viable and achievable in the predefined development time-frame.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Castles &amp; Chemo, Inc., is dedicated to raise money for cancer research and support in an effort to make cancer a relic of the past, through the use of tabletop role playing games, both by publishing game supplements and organizing &amp; running fundraising events, both in the United States and abroad.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During my own cancer treatment, one thing that kept me going week to week was my weekly D&amp;D game, where I stopped being John, fighting cancer, and became Alton the halfling, fighting orcs.  And now, 7 years since my diagnosis, I want to use what helped me get through chemo to help others in their struggle!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After our last successful IndieGoGo campaign, we are now officially recognized as a business entity, and will be receiving 501(c)3 status shortly.  Now it's time to move onto the next important piece; exposure!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The driving force behind our efforts is getting out there to show people that tabletop games can be used as a force for good.  That's where you come in!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
So here's the skinny.  Going to conventions is expensive.  Almost prohibitively so.  I've estimated my costs to attend a con as big as Gen Con to be somewhere around $2,000, just for the travel and booth alone. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is what I'm using as a benchmark, since being able to represent Castles &amp; Chemo at Gen Con is what I consider as my brass ring.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By supporting this campaign, you'll be helping me achieve that.  As thanks, I have several perks in store; adventures, shirts, and a chance to run a special 6 hour session of Castles &amp; Chemo at Gen Con.  Plus a bunch of other things in mind for stretch goals!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Any backer of $25 or more will get a PDF of the ""IndieGoGo© Collection,"" the $10 reward perk.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Backers will also receive papercraft miniatures to go with the adventures received as part of their perk.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
As I mentioned before, exposure is key to the success of my efforts.  The exposure I've already gained has been a major help, but there's always more good to be done.  Spread the word!  Either through this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and Goodle+, but also on Castles &amp; Chemo's pages.</div>

The RH Story

President Mike Merit flying a KC-130, 2003

Our concept was, at its birth, the dream of a Marine who missed his friends. Mike Merit, a disabled veteran and co-founder of our organization, made a wish on Memorial Day 2012 that he could honor his fallen comrades at national cemeteries thousands of miles away without traveling.
He wished that he could somehow see the graves of his brothers and sisters in arms that were lost while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
With Mike’s vision, we founded an organization that allows you to remember and honor American heroes in three ways: by putting flowers on their grave, seeing their memorial decorated with those flowers and sharing it with those you love.
At Remember Heroes, we know nothing can come close to the feeling of loyalty that personally visiting the final resting place of your loved ones imparts — and we don’t seek to imitate that. But, we can enable those who can’t make it to the grave themselves, people like Mike, to also honor and remember their heroes.
Our Service, as easy as 1 2 3...4 5 6 7 8
We’ve given you a broad explanation of how our service works; now let us take you step by step through the entire process.  Once an order is placed, we accomplish three tasks that allow you to honor your hero in a unique and significant way.

We deliver high-quality, fresh and unique floral arrangements to any Veterans grave in a national cemetery.
We send back high-resolution images of the gravesite, flower placement and cemetery.
We create a secure memorial page with these images and a 360 degree panoramic that you can invite your friends and family to see. Everyone invited can share stories, pictures and videos to remember their fallen hero.






In October, we will be able to take orders on our website for our first ten national cemeteries.  When you log on to rememberheroes.org, we will follow an easy process that allows you to choose your veteran and place an order for delivery in the next four business days.

<p><strong>The Comic Shop That Love Built</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been part of the comics and gaming culture for over 20 years between us (and probably beyond that- likely a lifetime- Steve started playing D&amp;D when he was 7), with two of us having worked at a local spot for over 16 years. Finally, after a number of people telling us if they ever came into some money they would open their own store and have the boys run it, we thought- Hey, we could do this! We WANT to do this!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, that’s what we’re about. We want to open our own comics and gaming store in Uptown Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, where we can provide you with the latest trends and stories that the industry has to offer in a space that welcomes everyone to participate in whatever form of geekery they find interesting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help</strong></p>
<p>We’ve come to find that Geek is hard to sell to investors and banks. We know that the culture is alive and thriving and know without a doubt that this will work and we’ll be so busy we won’t know what to do with ourselves! That’s where you come in. We feel this project is as much about opening a store as it is about a community. So, we’re asking you to invest in this community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who the heck are we and why are we worthy of your support?</strong></p>
<p>The shop will be set up and managed by Steve Henderson and Chris Duffield.  The boys have been running a local spot for over 20 years between them. They play well together and work well together. Dream team, right? Maybe it’s destiny that these two came together! They have a heart for all forms of geekery and a mind for the business. They provide awesome service and knowledge in the industry and can guide you to new hobbies and interests, if you’re willing to take that journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Steve’s other half, Tara Henderson, is also involved, but more in a cheerleader type-fashion for the moment. Her job is to help keep the boys on track and help tidy the store while she brushes up on what’s happening in the world of comics and games. Cheesy, right? But, it’s true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Slat Wall, Counter Tops and Display Cases... Oh My!</strong></p>
<p>It's not glamorous stuff, but money raised through this campaign will be used for:</p>
<p>Display cases, slat wall, counter tops, hooks</p>
<p>Point of Sale system- which will track our inventory and help us manage your comic accounts so we can put your comics aside for you!</p>
<p>Renovations! That means flooring, painting, light and a pretty new customer washroom</p>
<p>Chairs- Every gamer knows how important a good chair is for extended gaming time</p>
<p>Tables- Hey, we need a place to game on right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We love you. We really love you. And, we want to thank you! In addition to oodles of heartfelt appreciation and the satisfaction of knowing that you are making a dream possible (really!), you'll also get perks for your contribution. Check them out and be prepared to be delighted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We're beyond appreciative for any help we can get in turning this dream into a reality. A few other ways you can be a part of this adventure:</p>
<p>Spread the word through your social networks. Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, email... You can rest assured we'll take good care of any folks you send our way.</p>
<p>Cheer us on! Leave us a comment here and let us know you came by for a visit.</p>
<p>Volunteer your time or talents. As the project progresses we'll need help with stuff like painting, lifting, and the list goes on…</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We sure hope you can feel the abundance of love and appreciation we're sending your way!</p>

<h3>Resumen general</h3>
<p>En Potterzone somos un grupo de fans hispanohablantes que desarrollamos apps y videojuegos totalmente gratuitos con la temática de Harry Potter desde el año 2011. En estos 5 años hemos creado más de veinte juegos de la saga y hemos estado dándole un servicio constante a los fans de la Saga a través de nuestro portal <a href=""http://www.potterzone.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.potterzone.net</a><br/>Pero el día de hoy, queremos llevar nuestras apps a un nuevo nivel haciendo realidad el pedido que cientos de fans vienen realizando desde hace meses: vamos a crear un Harry Potter GO y una app en donde puedas transformar tu dispositivo móvil en una varita mágica. Pero para ello necesitamos tu ayuda.<br/>Gracias a tu colaboración económica podremos solventar todos los gastos necesarios para desarrollar la app de la mejor forma posible.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>¿Qué es WIZPROWL?</strong><br/>Wizprowl (<a href=""http://www.potterzone.net/wizprowl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.potterzone.net/wizprowl</a>) es la app HARRY POTTER GO que estamos desarrollando, en donde podrás recorrer el mundo muggle en busca de criaturas mágicas y coleccionar cromos de brujas y magos famosos. Además de realizar misiones de profesores y más. La app está prevista a lanzarse en el 2017 para los sistemas operativos ANDROID e IOS.<br/><br/><strong>¿Qué es POTTERZONE WAND?</strong><br/>Potterzone Wand es la app que te permitirá utilizar tu dispositivo móvil como si fuese una varita mágica. Con esta app podrás aprender a realizar hechizos con movimientos de varita y con tu pronunciación, ademas de brindarte la posibilidad de batirte en un duelo de magos contra otros estudiantes y también jugar a ciertos minijuegos que están disponibles actualmente en Potterzone de una nueva manera.</i></p>
<p><br/>¿Alguna vez imaginaste vivir la experiencia de ser un mago al igual que lo hacen los personajes de los libros y películas de la saga? ¡Esta es tu oportunidad de volver realidad tu sueño!</p>

En Potterzone somos un grupo de fans hispanohablantes que desarrollamos apps y videojuegos totalmente gratuitos con la temática de Harry Potter desde el año 2011. En estos 5 años hemos creado más de veinte juegos de la saga y hemos estado dándole un servicio constante a los fans de la Saga a través de nuestro portal www.potterzone.netPero el día de hoy, queremos llevar nuestras apps a un nuevo nivel haciendo realidad el pedido que cientos de fans vienen realizando desde hace meses: vamos a crear un Harry Potter GO y una app en donde puedas transformar tu dispositivo móvil en una varita mágica. Pero para ello necesitamos tu ayuda.Gracias a tu colaboración económica podremos solventar todos los gastos necesarios para desarrollar la app de la mejor forma posible.
¿Qué es WIZPROWL?Wizprowl (www.potterzone.net/wizprowl) es la app HARRY POTTER GO que estamos desarrollando, en donde podrás recorrer el mundo muggle en busca de criaturas mágicas y coleccionar cromos de brujas y magos famosos. Además de realizar misiones de profesores y más. La app está prevista a lanzarse en el 2017 para los sistemas operativos ANDROID e IOS.¿Qué es POTTERZONE WAND?Potterzone Wand es la app que te permitirá utilizar tu dispositivo móvil como si fuese una varita mágica. Con esta app podrás aprender a realizar hechizos con movimientos de varita y con tu pronunciación, ademas de brindarte la posibilidad de batirte en un duelo de magos contra otros estudiantes y también jugar a ciertos minijuegos que están disponibles actualmente en Potterzone de una nueva manera.
¿Alguna vez imaginaste vivir la experiencia de ser un mago al igual que lo hacen los personajes de los libros y películas de la saga? ¡Esta es tu oportunidad de volver realidad tu sueño!
 ¿Adonde irá mi colaboración?

En Potterzone utilizaremos tu colaboración para poder mejorar nuestros servidores, que necesitarán ser más eficientes para poder soportar las nuevas aplicaciones, cantidad de datos que se enviarán y recibirán y también para poder darle la bienvenida a cientos de usuarios nuevos.Por otra parte, tu ayuda también nos podrá permitir realizar todos los pagos necesarios para poder desarrollar nuestras apps para el sistema operativo IOS, ya que en la actualidad nuestras apps únicamente se encuentran disponibles para Android, debido a que desde la organización no contamos con el presupuesto necesario para adquirir las licencias que requiere Apple para desarrollar y publicar apps de su sistema operativo. Esto significaría que nuestras apps llegarían a cientos de dispositivos adicionales, entre los que se encuentran Iphone, Ipad, Ipod, entre otros.En cuanto a nuestras futuras apps, tu ayuda nos servirá para poder crear todas las criaturas necesarias para la app Wizprowl, así como también pagarle a nuevos programadores que se sumarán a los proyectos en los que venimos trabajando hace unos meses.

 
¿Hay algún reconocimiento por mi colaboración?Por supuesto que si! Todos los que colaboren se llevaran regalos como agradecimiento. Por favor, asegúrate que al momento de colaborar escribas tus datos correctamente para que podamos contactarte para enviarte tus regalos.


Quienes realicen una colaboración de $5 o superior recibirán un colgante del símbolo de Las Reliquias de la Muerte o un giratiempo, igual al que usó Hermione Granger en Harry Potter y el Prisionero de Azkaban. 

Quienes realicen una colaboración de $9 o superior, recibirán una bufanda o gorro de su casa de Hogwarts, igual a las que se ven en las películas de la saga. 

Todos los que colaboren con el proyecto, sin importar de cuánto sea su ayuda, recibirán como regalo una carta de aceptación del Colegio Hogwarts de Magia y Hechicería a su nombre en la cuenta de email con la que hayan realizado la donación. 

Tu colaboración tiene impacto
Tu ayuda nos permitirá cumplir tu sueño y el de miles de fans de todo el mundo. ¡Por eso eres tan valioso para nosotros y para el resto!

<h3>Hey everybody!</h3>
<p>Rowdy Apps Games here, Debbie &amp; T.G. Over the past few months, we've begun writing and coding the first steps towards what will be a fantastic, dream inspired adventure game for the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">iPad</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">iPhone</span> with the sort of sweet, tight gameplay that we feel these devices are worthy of. Right now we're basically a team of 2 - Debbie Ray and T.G. Robinson - and we're making an indie ios game, tentatively called, ""Flying Critters"" for the iPhone &amp; iPad. <br/></p>
<p>In December &amp; January we released some basic information about the game to a few of our game developer peers and a few close friends that led to some interesting comments and generally positive feedback about our game. <br/></p>
<p>Since that time we've had several people asking us about when the game will be ready and also about the possibility for us to open the game up to pre-orders, make the game available on multiple devices and a lot more. The amount of positive feedback from our family, friends and peers has been simply amazing. <br/></p>
<p>Opening up pre-orders for the game could be one way to go about this, but instead we want to make things a lot more interactive and interesting and also to allow the ios community and gamers of all kinds a chance to participate in actually shaping how the game finally ends up. Not to mention giving all our investors a place to appear in our final game credits. Because if you take the chance to fund us here today, that's exactly what we'd consider you, our partner!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flyingcritters.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/banner2_468x60-1.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>About Flying Critters</h3>
<p>Flying Critters is a simple flying, fantasy and action arcade type game about flying, critters, dreams, coins and hoping to get set on fire. Yeah, in this game that's a good thing. <br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Think Doctor Doolittle meets The Flying Nun</span>. Add a lot of airtime, multiple dream lands, all sorts of fantastic and happy little critters, imaginative objectives and you've got our game. <br/></p>
<p>Your wild adventure is to personally help these normally land locked animals live up to their high flying dreams. Sometimes you'll do good, sometimes not so much, sometimes you'll get some coins, sometimes you might catch on fire! Flame on! <br/></p>
<p>But when you do play our game you will get the opportunity to experience a simple game that is both easy to play, yet hard to master at the same time. A fine line for sure.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.flyingcritters.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/critters.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Money and Help<br/>
</h3>
<p>Well, for one thing, we want to know that the ios community and all of you out there are on our side by supporting a couple of dreamers in making our dream game a reality. Secondly, with your help and support, we hope to release a game that fully exceeds all our expectations and yours too.<br/></p>
<p>The online community takes a huge role in exactly what makes or breaks an indie game project. And the more people who take the time here to pledge, the bigger, better and more incredible Flying Critters will be. If our entire 100% goal is met, you can definitely expect to see this  game come out on Apple's iPad, iPod Touch &amp; iPhone too. And if we go way beyond our goal, think Android baby! <br/></p>
<p>Right now we have some basic stuff done, we've already got a lot of art and music, a basic demo, and a lot of ideas. However our dream of making this wonderful little game a reality <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">needs your help</span>. Our game is going to involve a lot of hours of intense animation and level design - and it's extremely important to us that our coders and artists continue to be paid for their work, and our own limited resources are dwindling. Plus, we've got really cool prizes for all our backers!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>The Game</h3><p>Can you imagine what it would be like to be part of a huge medieval online world, where there were no NPCs and no quests, but where all the day in and day out tasks and socializing and battling were planned and carried out by real people? This is the essence of <a href=""http://thronesofvalor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Thrones of Valor"">Thrones of Valor</a>â„¢<br/><br/>In the world of Thrones of Valor, there are 6 Realms, each with a castle, a King or Queen, and many Knights of Valor.<br/><br/>In each realm, surrounding the palace, are 24 villages. Each village has a Lord with a castle, a Steward working for the Lord, a Tavern, Mercantile Shops run by proprietors, and citizens who own Manors, Cottages, Hovels and Travel wagons.<br/></p><p>All real people, 100% Pure Meat!</p><p><br/>The game of Thrones of Valor is about realm versus realm battling. It's about winning or losing territory. It's about forming guilds and raid parties and having sophisticated ways of holding secret meetings to plan strategy. It's about bartering, trading goods, abilities, equipment, and gold. And it's about socializing, forming relationships with your fellow citizens, forming diplomatic relationships with other realms, and even spying on and collecting intelligence on other realms.<br/><br/>The thread that holds all of this together, is our philosophy of offering the community brilliant graphics, immersive music and sound effects, powerful communication tools such as video, audio and text chat, flexible systems for trading, and ways to constantly improve your characters, yet leaving the ""how"" to you. You have the world and the tools, yet you will have to decide along with your fellow citizens of the realm, how you will conduct yourselves and play the game.<br/><br/>Will the natural leaders you elect, lead you to ruthless battle, or to pursue diplomatic solutions? Will you spend your time in Thrones of Valor fighting to keep your village from being swept into another realm, or will you spend your time hanging out with friends, trading items, and going to the tavern to enjoy some ale? Again, the play is up to you.<br/><br/></p><h3>The Technology</h3><p>When you back Thrones of Valor, you're backing a game with 80% of the technology already built and customer-tested during the past 3 years. Thrones of Valor is being built into our popular Virtual Tabletop software <a href=""http://itabletop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""iTabletop"">iTabletop</a>. iTabletop, written in Microsoft Silverlight and which runs on PC and Mac, has over 7,000 customers in its community, and is a platform built for creating media-rich immersive worlds and compelling RPG games.<br/><br/>The iTabletop platform already has support for external top-down scrollable maps, customizable avatars (called tokens,) interior high-definition room graphics, music playlists, sound effects, live streaming video and audio for group video and audio chat, and much more. <br/><br/>To build Thrones of Valor, the iTabletop code base will be expanded and improved to handle the new type of game play we're designing for the game. While the current iTabletop is focused on providing tools for gamers to build their own online, webcam-enabled paper &amp; pen style RPG games, Thrones of Valor, on the other hand, is designed to be a huge pre-built MMORTS, with many new features added so that players have an exciting daily play experience. <br/><br/>To keep costs lower and speed development, we have designed Thrones of Valor to take advantage of all that iTabletop currently has to offer. <br/><br/>Thrones of Valor technology will include:<br/></p><ul>
<li>Large, top-down 3D maps of all 144 villages. We call these ""Exterior"" maps.</li>
<li>Animated character avatars with the ability to engage in bubble-text chat while walking through the exterior village maps. While hanging out in the exterior village maps, you can socialize, trade items, battle other real players, raid villages, and generally get to where you want to go.</li>
<li>Medieval dwellings represented on the exterior village maps that have hot-links to enter their richly-rendered 3D interior spaces. These are dwellings such as cottages, manors, taverns, the great hall, the lord's castle, the Palace as well as many others.</li>
<li>Security settings so that dwellings can be open to everyone, to all the players on your friends list, to guild members, to specific players, or even just by invitation only.</li>
<li>An invitation system to invite all your friends, guilds, or specific players into the interior of your dwelling for a full-on social experience including video, voice and text chat.</li>
<li>Fully customizable interior spaces where you can add your own music, sound effects, graphics, streaming videos, and even documents to share with other players. You make your interior spaces your own, and express yourself the way you want to.</li>
<li>A powerful whiteboard system for planning raids or even just goofing off with friends.</li>
<li>Email and text notifications for meetings and get-togethers. Imagine receiving an email or text reminding you of a pending raid you've planned to attend. Or notifying you that your village or a neighboring village is being attacked so you can jump online and help defend her with all your might.</li>
<li>An inventory trading system used for everything from friendly trading on up to running your own mercantile business.</li>
<li>A combat and action resolution system where you pit your stats, abilities, and equipment against your opponent's to see who is victorious. The combat system has similarities to that of a trading card game (TCG), with random digital packs you purchase to keep your character advancing in strength, ability and coolness.</li>
<li>An in-game store to purchase costume upgrades, buff-packs, homes, taverns, and other items to constantly improve your game experience.</li>
<li>And much more.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Noteworthy technology already built into iTabletop:<br/></p><ul>
<li>iTabletop is 100% in the cloud using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute), Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), and Amazon CloudFront. This means that all graphics, music, SFX, streaming videos and documents in-game are pulled from the Amazon cloud and are cached in every major city around the world. So if you're playing the game from Singapore, all the media loads from Singapore. If you're playing from London, all your media loads from London. This adds up to an extremely fast graphics, audio and media experience in Thrones of Valor.</li>
<li>A big part of Thrones of Valor is the experience of being face-to-face with your friends and fellow citizens. iTabletop currently has live webcam streaming servers in the US, the EU and Asia Pacific. This results in low latency for your video chat, perfectly synchronized voice-to-video, and a better overall social experience.</li>
<li>iTabletop runs on both PC and Mac due to its Silverlight platform. Also because iTabletop relies on pre-rendered high-definition 3D graphics and sprites instead of real time 3D, it can be played on legacy PCs and Macs, and avoids the motion sickness that real time 3D systems cause in some people.</li>
<li>Scalability of systems is paramount for an MMO. With all our servers virtualized in the Amazon EC2 cloud, we can spin up new servers in a matter of minutes and tie everything together through the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer, and take advantage of edge and origin server architecture. While these terms may be foreign to you, just be assured we can swiftly grow as our player base grows.</li>
</ul><p><br/> </p><p><strong><font size=""3"">The Pay Model<br/></font></strong></p><p>Thrones of Valor is free to play. Gamesabi will make money selling in-game digital content such as character and costume upgrades, in-game real estate, buff-packs, etc., none of which are necessary to play and have fun. This is a popular trend used by many MMOs such as LOTRO, D&amp;D Online, and others. Players have the ability to jump in and play as much and as often as they like, and only purchase those things that will really impact their own play experience.<br/> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>We at Gamesabi feel passionately about building a large online community that has powerful tools to play, and yet has the choice to play the way they desire to play. <br/><br/>We believe in games that foster the maximum in emergent behavior, so that you, the players, end up coming up with ways to play that we never imagined. <br/><br/>And we look forward to the many real-life new relationships that are formed within the Thrones of Valor community, be they friendship, romance, camaraderie, or even business related.<br/><br/>It's a powerful thing to create a new community of people having fun and being challenged and creating social connections, and we take this commitment and responsibility seriously. We desire to make this a reality, just as we made iTabletop a reality and continue to expand and improve it on a regular basis.<br/><br/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are seeking to raise $30,000 to make Thrones of Valor a reality. The money you provide will go toward:</p><ul>
<li>Expanding and improving the iTabletop game platform. And since all Thrones of Valor perks include a lifetime membership to iTabletop you can start using right now, this will directly impact you beginning immediately.</li>
<li>Detailing and refining the Thrones of Valor game design, so we end up with a game that is thrilling and unique to play.</li>
<li>Purchasing 3D modeling and rendering assets, in-game music and sound effects licensing, and all the other assets that make up a graphical video game.</li>
<li>Composing and rendering 24 exterior village maps. Each of the 6 realms will use these maps.</li>
<li>Rendering and constructing interior spaces for each type of medieval dwelling.</li>
<li>Covering the monthly costs of the game development. We work to keep this low by working virtually from our home offices and not having to pay for an office lease, but we do pay for our server infrastructure through Amazon.com, our business-level Internet connections, and other development necessities.</li>
<li>Eventual use of marketing funds. We strive to keep this low as well, first by opting to use this crowdfunding system at IndieGoGo where we can simultaneously raise funding while at the same time build up our initial player base through the perks we offer. We also work to keep marketing funding needs low by building the game to be more viral, whereby it becomes more fun to play when your friends play, so you naturally tell friends about the game and invite them to play for free.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>What you get are fun perks that give you something you can do right now, in the form of lifetime memberships to iTabletop.com for use in gaming and creating unique worlds to use for video chat and hanging out with friends and family, and perks that give you something you'll do later when Thrones of Valor is complete. You'll see the perks give you ownership of medieval dwellings, special titles in the game, special abilities and duties, from home owners through Knights of Valor and even on up to King and Queen of the Realm. Perks can even give you the ability to name your village or name your realm.</p><p> </p><h3>What if we Don't Raise the Entire Goal Amount?</h3><p>One thing to keep in mind. We as a company have a track record of successfully bootstrapping a commercial gaming product. iTabletop was developed with our own sweat, our own money, and real revenue from customers purchasing lifetime memberships and other special promotions. When you contribute to this campaign, you'll be directly helping us make Thrones of Valor a reality, and yet at the same time if we don't reach our financial goal, we will still continue bootstrapping this game and it will become a reality because we're passionate about it. It will just take a good deal longer! We say this just to help alleviate any concerns that if we don't reach our requested funding goal your contribution will be for nothing. To the contrary, every dollar we receive from this campaign will greatly help move Thrones of Valor and iTabletop forward and won't be wasted.</p><p> </p><p>As another safety net, we're giving contributors the iTabletop Lifetime Accounts so that you're getting something of real value right up front. With iTabletop you can play paper/pen RPGs and other board games face to face with your group of friends. You can even use it as a very cool, customizable group video chat application.</p><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Of course spread the word to your friends! Help us find contributors! Make sure that when you play Thrones of Valor, your friends are also there playing. As an encouragement to seek out your friends for contributing to this campaign, at this early stage we can and will accommodate when you request a group of you to be in the same realm and village. Later when released, to keep the game balanced, these kinds of requests will be more difficult or even possibly unavailable. But again, please help spread the word and seek out contributors with whom you want to play the game!</p><p> </p><p>Thank you so much for your time and for your considering contributing to this unique and fun game. Please be sure to check the <a href=""http://thronesofvalor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Thrones of Valor"">Thrones of Valor </a>website for more information on the game, and the <a href=""http://itabletop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""iTabletop"">iTabletop</a> website for more information on the technology and community we have built there.</p><p> </p><p>Sincerely,</p><p> </p><p>KnightErrant (James Auld)</p><p>Ranger (Ed Blumberg)<br/><br/></p><h3 class=""c_title""><span class=""TitleHead"" id=""dnn_ctr1638_dnnTITLE_titleLabel""><font color=""#cc0000"">*Common Backer Perks</font></span></h3><h3 class=""c_title""><font size=""2"">All backers of Thrones of Valor will receive these perks:</font></h3><ul>
<li>Access to Thrones of Valor design forums, with video-chat access to designers and developers to help shape the game experience and begin creating a fun community right away</li>
<li>At least one character costume upgrade</li>
<li>At least two free additional character buff packs, each containing abilities, equipment and stat buffs</li>

Thrones of Valor game design copyright (c) 2012 Gamesabi, Inc.</p></div>","The GameCan you imagine what it would be like to be part of a huge medieval online world, where there were no NPCs and no quests, but where all the day in and day out tasks and socializing and battling were planned and carried out by real people? This is the essence of Thrones of Valorâ„¢In the world of Thrones of Valor, there are 6 Realms, each with a castle, a King or Queen, and many Knights of Valor.In each realm, surrounding the palace, are 24 villages. Each village has a Lord with a castle, a Steward working for the Lord, a Tavern, Mercantile Shops run by proprietors, and citizens who own Manors, Cottages, Hovels and Travel wagons.All real people, 100% Pure Meat!The game of Thrones of Valor is about realm versus realm battling. It's about winning or losing territory. It's about forming guilds and raid parties and having sophisticated ways of holding secret meetings to plan strategy. It's about bartering, trading goods, abilities, equipment, and gold. And it's about socializing, forming relationships with your fellow citizens, forming diplomatic relationships with other realms, and even spying on and collecting intelligence on other realms.The thread that holds all of this together, is our philosophy of offering the community brilliant graphics, immersive music and sound effects, powerful communication tools such as video, audio and text chat, flexible systems for trading, and ways to constantly improve your characters, yet leaving the ""how"" to you. You have the world and the tools, yet you will have to decide along with your fellow citizens of the realm, how you will conduct yourselves and play the game.Will the natural leaders you elect, lead you to ruthless battle, or to pursue diplomatic solutions? Will you spend your time in Thrones of Valor fighting to keep your village from being swept into another realm, or will you spend your time hanging out with friends, trading items, and going to the tavern to enjoy some ale? Again, the play is up to you.The TechnologyWhen you back Thrones of Valor, you're backing a game with 80% of the technology already built and customer-tested during the past 3 years. Thrones of Valor is being built into our popular Virtual Tabletop software iTabletop. iTabletop, written in Microsoft Silverlight and which runs on PC and Mac, has over 7,000 customers in its community, and is a platform built for creating media-rich immersive worlds and compelling RPG games.The iTabletop platform already has support for external top-down scrollable maps, customizable avatars (called tokens,) interior high-definition room graphics, music playlists, sound effects, live streaming video and audio for group video and audio chat, and much more. To build Thrones of Valor, the iTabletop code base will be expanded and improved to handle the new type of game play we're designing for the game. While the current iTabletop is focused on providing tools for gamers to build their own online, webcam-enabled paper & pen style RPG games, Thrones of Valor, on the other hand, is designed to be a huge pre-built MMORTS, with many new features added so that players have an exciting daily play experience. To keep costs lower and speed development, we have designed Thrones of Valor to take advantage of all that iTabletop currently has to offer. Thrones of Valor technology will include:
Large, top-down 3D maps of all 144 villages. We call these ""Exterior"" maps.
Animated character avatars with the ability to engage in bubble-text chat while walking through the exterior village maps. While hanging out in the exterior village maps, you can socialize, trade items, battle other real players, raid villages, and generally get to where you want to go.
Medieval dwellings represented on the exterior village maps that have hot-links to enter their richly-rendered 3D interior spaces. These are dwellings such as cottages, manors, taverns, the great hall, the lord's castle, the Palace as well as many others.
Security settings so that dwellings can be open to everyone, to all the players on your friends list, to guild members, to specific players, or even just by invitation only.
An invitation system to invite all your friends, guilds, or specific players into the interior of your dwelling for a full-on social experience including video, voice and text chat.
Fully customizable interior spaces where you can add your own music, sound effects, graphics, streaming videos, and even documents to share with other players. You make your interior spaces your own, and express yourself the way you want to.
A powerful whiteboard system for planning raids or even just goofing off with friends.
Email and text notifications for meetings and get-togethers. Imagine receiving an email or text reminding you of a pending raid you've planned to attend. Or notifying you that your village or a neighboring village is being attacked so you can jump online and help defend her with all your might.
An inventory trading system used for everything from friendly trading on up to running your own mercantile business.
A combat and action resolution system where you pit your stats, abilities, and equipment against your opponent's to see who is victorious. The combat system has similarities to that of a trading card game (TCG), with random digital packs you purchase to keep your character advancing in strength, ability and coolness.
An in-game store to purchase costume upgrades, buff-packs, homes, taverns, and other items to constantly improve your game experience.
And much more.
 Noteworthy technology already built into iTabletop:
iTabletop is 100% in the cloud using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute), Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), and Amazon CloudFront. This means that all graphics, music, SFX, streaming videos and documents in-game are pulled from the Amazon cloud and are cached in every major city around the world. So if you're playing the game from Singapore, all the media loads from Singapore. If you're playing from London, all your media loads from London. This adds up to an extremely fast graphics, audio and media experience in Thrones of Valor.
A big part of Thrones of Valor is the experience of being face-to-face with your friends and fellow citizens. iTabletop currently has live webcam streaming servers in the US, the EU and Asia Pacific. This results in low latency for your video chat, perfectly synchronized voice-to-video, and a better overall social experience.
iTabletop runs on both PC and Mac due to its Silverlight platform. Also because iTabletop relies on pre-rendered high-definition 3D graphics and sprites instead of real time 3D, it can be played on legacy PCs and Macs, and avoids the motion sickness that real time 3D systems cause in some people.
Scalability of systems is paramount for an MMO. With all our servers virtualized in the Amazon EC2 cloud, we can spin up new servers in a matter of minutes and tie everything together through the Amazon Elastic Load Balancer, and take advantage of edge and origin server architecture. While these terms may be foreign to you, just be assured we can swiftly grow as our player base grows.
 The Pay ModelThrones of Valor is free to play. Gamesabi will make money selling in-game digital content such as character and costume upgrades, in-game real estate, buff-packs, etc., none of which are necessary to play and have fun. This is a popular trend used by many MMOs such as LOTRO, D&D Online, and others. Players have the ability to jump in and play as much and as often as they like, and only purchase those things that will really impact their own play experience. The ImpactWe at Gamesabi feel passionately about building a large online community that has powerful tools to play, and yet has the choice to play the way they desire to play. We believe in games that foster the maximum in emergent behavior, so that you, the players, end up coming up with ways to play that we never imagined. And we look forward to the many real-life new relationships that are formed within the Thrones of Valor community, be they friendship, romance, camaraderie, or even business related.It's a powerful thing to create a new community of people having fun and being challenged and creating social connections, and we take this commitment and responsibility seriously. We desire to make this a reality, just as we made iTabletop a reality and continue to expand and improve it on a regular basis.What We Need & What You GetWe are seeking to raise $30,000 to make Thrones of Valor a reality. The money you provide will go toward:
Expanding and improving the iTabletop game platform. And since all Thrones of Valor perks include a lifetime membership to iTabletop you can start using right now, this will directly impact you beginning immediately.
Detailing and refining the Thrones of Valor game design, so we end up with a game that is thrilling and unique to play.
Purchasing 3D modeling and rendering assets, in-game music and sound effects licensing, and all the other assets that make up a graphical video game.
Composing and rendering 24 exterior village maps. Each of the 6 realms will use these maps.
Rendering and constructing interior spaces for each type of medieval dwelling.
Covering the monthly costs of the game development. We work to keep this low by working virtually from our home offices and not having to pay for an office lease, but we do pay for our server infrastructure through Amazon.com, our business-level Internet connections, and other development necessities.
Eventual use of marketing funds. We strive to keep this low as well, first by opting to use this crowdfunding system at IndieGoGo where we can simultaneously raise funding while at the same time build up our initial player base through the perks we offer. We also work to keep marketing funding needs low by building the game to be more viral, whereby it becomes more fun to play when your friends play, so you naturally tell friends about the game and invite them to play for free.
 What you get are fun perks that give you something you can do right now, in the form of lifetime memberships to iTabletop.com for use in gaming and creating unique worlds to use for video chat and hanging out with friends and family, and perks that give you something you'll do later when Thrones of Valor is complete. You'll see the perks give you ownership of medieval dwellings, special titles in the game, special abilities and duties, from home owners through Knights of Valor and even on up to King and Queen of the Realm. Perks can even give you the ability to name your village or name your realm. What if we Don't Raise the Entire Goal Amount?One thing to keep in mind. We as a company have a track record of successfully bootstrapping a commercial gaming product. iTabletop was developed with our own sweat, our own money, and real revenue from customers purchasing lifetime memberships and other special promotions. When you contribute to this campaign, you'll be directly helping us make Thrones of Valor a reality, and yet at the same time if we don't reach our financial goal, we will still continue bootstrapping this game and it will become a reality because we're passionate about it. It will just take a good deal longer! We say this just to help alleviate any concerns that if we don't reach our requested funding goal your contribution will be for nothing. To the contrary, every dollar we receive from this campaign will greatly help move Thrones of Valor and iTabletop forward and won't be wasted. As another safety net, we're giving contributors the iTabletop Lifetime Accounts so that you're getting something of real value right up front. With iTabletop you can play paper/pen RPGs and other board games face to face with your group of friends. You can even use it as a very cool, customizable group video chat application. Other Ways You Can HelpOf course spread the word to your friends! Help us find contributors! Make sure that when you play Thrones of Valor, your friends are also there playing. As an encouragement to seek out your friends for contributing to this campaign, at this early stage we can and will accommodate when you request a group of you to be in the same realm and village. Later when released, to keep the game balanced, these kinds of requests will be more difficult or even possibly unavailable. But again, please help spread the word and seek out contributors with whom you want to play the game! Thank you so much for your time and for your considering contributing to this unique and fun game. Please be sure to check the Thrones of Valor website for more information on the game, and the iTabletop website for more information on the technology and community we have built there. Sincerely, KnightErrant (James Auld)Ranger (Ed Blumberg)*Common Backer PerksAll backers of Thrones of Valor will receive these perks:

<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>Initially planned to be released for the iPhone, It is a unique and innovative puzzle mobile game coming soon to iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone and Facebook. Unique and compelling, not only does it educates players, but it also helps them have a great time too. Consequences are a big part of the game, and the learning experience that players gain is a major factor.</p>
<p>Within the game we have tried to ensure that players gain much more than just another gaming experience. This game is so much more than a simple gaming title, and we are proud of this.</p>
<p>In the game, players are required to answer up to 45 questions in each level. For each question that they answer correctly, a tile is unlocked. Behind these tiles is a hidden image. To the complete the level, players must guess this hidden image.</p>
<p>To get a high score from each level, players must guess the hidden image correctly with the least amount of unlocked tiles. In addition, players are also able to earn special reward points by obtaining the best score for each level. These points can be redeemed in our online store to win physical items.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the player has five lives in the game for each level. Losing all of these lives will make the player lose the level (as well as their level score). However, this can be prevented by purchasing In-App purchase gems which can then be used to access helpful gameplay features such as obtaining a hint for the hidden image and unlocking a tile without having to answer the current question.</p>
<p></p>

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>This game is different. Rather than just offer the standard mobile gaming experience, we have delivered a title that has deep and complex themes. Players will find themselves making decisions that affect their gaming ‘life’ in dramatic ways. These decisions reflect their knowledge, so players gain an insight into the challenges that test their knowledge.</p>
<p>Our goal is simple. We expect one million players to download this mobile app and get involved in the adventure. We expect players to reflect on their own behavior in the real world after playing this game.</p>

<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>My name is Ramnath Suthakar, and I am the Managing Director of Codeexceptional Ltd. I am very passionate about the gaming industry. My ambition is to make my company an exceptional mobile game development and publisher company.</p>
<p>I am also an upcoming short movie and video song artist in the UK. However, I have also gained a good education alongside these performing arts qualifications, progressing to gain a degree. My vision is to create more jobs for aspiring graduates while doing something I love.</p>
<p>Whilst at University I studied Computer Game Programming. I attended Staffordshire University where I gained a BEng (Hons) in Computer Game Programming. In 2010, Staffordshire University awarded me first prize for my final year project.</p>

<h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1>
<p>We're using Indiegogo because we see it as an incredible opportunity to get gamers involved in the development of the game right from the beginning. This gives us a better understanding of what they want. Gamers get to see behind the scenes, feel an ownership of the game, and be a part of the development process.</p>
<p>Since my teenage years, it has been my ambition and dream to develop my own game. My self, my brother and another 2 individuals who have worked on this game on a daily basis. To develop this game we have done everything on our own, including designing, developing, research, and funding.</p>
<p>At this stage almost 50% of the game development is complete for iPhone, with further work needed on the UI, Themes, Music and Development. In addition, we are required to hire a freelancer to help us develop for other platforms.</p>
<p>We want to add more modes, more levels, more questions, more hidden images, better UI, and possibly multiplayer. In order for us to achieve all these objectives, we need your help and funding, freeing up financial resources that will enable us to hire freelancers for the musical and creative aspects of development.</p>
<p>With funding, we aim to complete and release the iPhone version. By achieving our stretch goal we will then start working on iPad, Android, Windows Phone, Tablet, PC, Mac and Linux.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/16654/files/20130816182501-641d485c86f35a09471e88bb9dae8936_large.png?1376702701"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Why do we need your help?</h1>
<p>We have already begun development, but our budget is currently limited. We want this game to be one of the best puzzle games with a better playing experience. In addition to that, our main focus is to achieve 2 goals with this game.</p>
<p>1.) Having an enjoyable playing experience.</p>
<p>2.) Improve the player's general knowledge and/or educating the player.</p>
<p>Creating such a game requires significant levels of funding.</p>
<p>We're making good progress on the game already, but need to complete on the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 music tracks</li>
<li>Sound effects</li>
<li>Fonts, Additional Graphic and GUI Design</li>
<li>Development-software licenses, compatibility-testing services and more.</li>
<li>Hiring a freelancer to help speed up the process and to develop for other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our stretch goals are listed at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
<p><b>£5,000 -</b> In addition to the iPhone platform, we will also release the game on iPad.</p>

<h1>What is your money going toward?</h1>
<p><b>Producing Music/Sounds:</b> The game theme, winning, losing, the game theme music, other music and sounds need to be produced. we personally do not have experience in producing music and we require financial support to hire freelancers to help me produce this.</p>
<p><b>Software Licenses:</b> Since we just started the game, we are missing a lot of software that we need to make this game. Funding is required to facilitate appropriate use of effective software.</p>
<p><b>Server client development/Hosting:</b> Game API, which will be handling the user interface from a server. We own a server, which can handle a limited number of players.</p>
<p>For the future growth of the project, we need to have 2-8 more servers. Based on the heavy load already experienced on our servers, we want to prepare for future large-scale growth.</p>
<p>This is also the first time that we've worked on server client handling events. When we reach a large-scale impact, the current server will not be able to handle the load, so we want to spend the appropriate amounts of time and effort to get it right.</p>
<p><b>Art :</b> We want to contract a concept artist to help us with creating a story board, the background images, the in-game UI look and feel and more items exclusively designed for the game.</p>
<p><b>Polishing:</b> Any funding in excess of our goal will be invested into refining the game even further with more resources, increased functionality, more levels, more items, more challenges and much more.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We’ll only release once it’s the fantastic game we know it can be. And we want to get it into the hands of players in mid September 2013. The game is going to be powerful, unique and rather wonderful, with the added incentive of being educational too.</p>
<p>We've already finished the framework of the game and are confident that it will ship in 2013.</p>
<p>Having shipped some apps in the App Store already, and having worked on several others for other publishers, we know that device compatibility and performance is always a challenge. We are currently targeting all iPhone &amp; iPod devices from 2010 onward (which specifically leaves out iPhone 3GS or earlier), and iOS 5.1 and above. Depending on what Apple does with iOS, we may have to trim our list of supported devices and versions.</p>
<p>Android devices have an even broader range of performance than iOS devices. Our current minimum Android version is 2.3, but even within 2.3, some devices with older graphics chips or lower RAM may not be supportable.</p>
<p>Before releasing the game, it has to be tested and perfected. Balancing and bug-testing the game will also take time.</p>
<br/><p></p></span></span></span></div>","What is it?
Initially planned to be released for the iPhone, It is a unique and innovative puzzle mobile game coming soon to iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone and Facebook. Unique and compelling, not only does it educates players, but it also helps them have a great time too. Consequences are a big part of the game, and the learning experience that players gain is a major factor.
Within the game we have tried to ensure that players gain much more than just another gaming experience. This game is so much more than a simple gaming title, and we are proud of this.
In the game, players are required to answer up to 45 questions in each level. For each question that they answer correctly, a tile is unlocked. Behind these tiles is a hidden image. To the complete the level, players must guess this hidden image.
To get a high score from each level, players must guess the hidden image correctly with the least amount of unlocked tiles. In addition, players are also able to earn special reward points by obtaining the best score for each level. These points can be redeemed in our online store to win physical items.
Intriguingly, the player has five lives in the game for each level. Losing all of these lives will make the player lose the level (as well as their level score). However, this can be prevented by purchasing In-App purchase gems which can then be used to access helpful gameplay features such as obtaining a hint for the hidden image and unlocking a tile without having to answer the current question.


Why?
This game is different. Rather than just offer the standard mobile gaming experience, we have delivered a title that has deep and complex themes. Players will find themselves making decisions that affect their gaming ‘life’ in dramatic ways. These decisions reflect their knowledge, so players gain an insight into the challenges that test their knowledge.
Our goal is simple. We expect one million players to download this mobile app and get involved in the adventure. We expect players to reflect on their own behavior in the real world after playing this game.

Who am I?
My name is Ramnath Suthakar, and I am the Managing Director of Codeexceptional Ltd. I am very passionate about the gaming industry. My ambition is to make my company an exceptional mobile game development and publisher company.
I am also an upcoming short movie and video song artist in the UK. However, I have also gained a good education alongside these performing arts qualifications, progressing to gain a degree. My vision is to create more jobs for aspiring graduates while doing something I love.
Whilst at University I studied Computer Game Programming. I attended Staffordshire University where I gained a BEng (Hons) in Computer Game Programming. In 2010, Staffordshire University awarded me first prize for my final year project.

Why Indiegogo?
We're using Indiegogo because we see it as an incredible opportunity to get gamers involved in the development of the game right from the beginning. This gives us a better understanding of what they want. Gamers get to see behind the scenes, feel an ownership of the game, and be a part of the development process.
Since my teenage years, it has been my ambition and dream to develop my own game. My self, my brother and another 2 individuals who have worked on this game on a daily basis. To develop this game we have done everything on our own, including designing, developing, research, and funding.
At this stage almost 50% of the game development is complete for iPhone, with further work needed on the UI, Themes, Music and Development. In addition, we are required to hire a freelancer to help us develop for other platforms.
We want to add more modes, more levels, more questions, more hidden images, better UI, and possibly multiplayer. In order for us to achieve all these objectives, we need your help and funding, freeing up financial resources that will enable us to hire freelancers for the musical and creative aspects of development.
With funding, we aim to complete and release the iPhone version. By achieving our stretch goal we will then start working on iPad, Android, Windows Phone, Tablet, PC, Mac and Linux.

Why do we need your help?
We have already begun development, but our budget is currently limited. We want this game to be one of the best puzzle games with a better playing experience. In addition to that, our main focus is to achieve 2 goals with this game.
1.) Having an enjoyable playing experience.
2.) Improve the player's general knowledge and/or educating the player.
Creating such a game requires significant levels of funding.
We're making good progress on the game already, but need to complete on the following aspects:

10 music tracks
Sound effects
Fonts, Additional Graphic and GUI Design
Development-software licenses, compatibility-testing services and more.
Hiring a freelancer to help speed up the process and to develop for other platforms.

Our stretch goals are listed at the bottom of the page.
Stretch Goals
£5,000 - In addition to the iPhone platform, we will also release the game on iPad.
£7500 - In addition to the iOS platform, we will also release the game for Windows Phone.
£10000 - In addition to the iOS platform and Windows Phone, we will also release the game for Android devices.
£12,500 - In addition to the iOS platform, Android and Windows Phone, we will also release the game for Facebook.
£25,000 - In addition to the iOS platform, Android, Windows Phone and Facebook we will also release the game for PC, Mac and Linux.
£40,000 - We will create multiplayer capability for all platforms.

What is your money going toward?
Producing Music/Sounds: The game theme, winning, losing, the game theme music, other music and sounds need to be produced. we personally do not have experience in producing music and we require financial support to hire freelancers to help me produce this.
Software Licenses: Since we just started the game, we are missing a lot of software that we need to make this game. Funding is required to facilitate appropriate use of effective software.
Server client development/Hosting: Game API, which will be handling the user interface from a server. We own a server, which can handle a limited number of players.
For the future growth of the project, we need to have 2-8 more servers. Based on the heavy load already experienced on our servers, we want to prepare for future large-scale growth.
This is also the first time that we've worked on server client handling events. When we reach a large-scale impact, the current server will not be able to handle the load, so we want to spend the appropriate amounts of time and effort to get it right.
Art : We want to contract a concept artist to help us with creating a story board, the background images, the in-game UI look and feel and more items exclusively designed for the game.
Polishing: Any funding in excess of our goal will be invested into refining the game even further with more resources, increased functionality, more levels, more items, more challenges and much more.
Budget Breakdown
20% Coding: Game mechanics, AI, influence system, etc.15% Graphical content; the concept art, GUI and texturing.25% Music and sound design.15% Backer rewards.12% Software license.5% Marketing.8% Indiegogo fee & Third-party payment fee

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>GeekGamer.TV was created on the foundation of creating engaging, fun and interactive content from an authentic perspective for Geeks and Gamers alike.</p>
<p>Minecraft Me is the show from GGTV that covers everything about the awesome game from Mojang called Minecraft.  Once started as a show that showed the ""noob"" how to play, it has now evolved to a show that covers news, creations, packs and much, much more.</p>
<p>This campaign is geared to send the show about Minecraft to the ultimate convention about Minecraft.....Minecon!</p>
<p>We feel it's important to have an authentic perspective in covering this awesome event and we believe we are NOTHING without community.  That being said, we ask for your support in helping us get our crew to Florida to cover this global event!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a crew of four people for coverage of events on the road.  We have 1 cameraman, 1 support person and of course the two hosts of the show, Chase and Joe.   In our planning, we have estimated that we will need $5,000.00 to cover travel, food, lodging, equipment costs, etc.</p>
<p>This is to cover the costs of getting to and staying in Florida for the event.  It does not cover the hours of editing, post production, interviewing, planning, etc.   As we stated in the video, we do this as a <strong>passion.  We are not making anything from this, other then the awesome gratitude our community gives us! :)</strong></p>

<p><img alt=""Starcave Entertainment"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.starcave.net/uploads/site/thumbs/s980_site-1-1345978579_starcavesmallogo1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>We are an indie games development studio called Starcave Entertainment, located in the west of Ireland. Our development office is within the Innovation Center of the National University of Ireland Galway. </p>
<p>Founded by Keith Killilea, I enjoy creating stories &amp; worlds that can capture people's imagination, attention and excitement. Since 1994 I have been creating video games on the Commodore 64 to PC / Consoles. Money is not a driving force for myself but to just see even one person having fun playing one of my creations!</p>
<p>It's about the stories, the user engagement within that fictional universe that is creative, fun &amp; for a brief time you can leave your reality behind.</p>
<p>There is a few (six) of us involved here in the team that have 20+ years of games development experience. The Irish have a reputation of quality story-telling and entertainment - we will take this to a new level with Terra if you can kindly support us. </p>
<p>See our <a href=""http://www.starcave.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Starcave Entertainment Website"">company website</a> for more information. </p>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding &amp; Indiegogo?</h3>
<p><img alt=""Terra Formations Development"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.starcave.net/uploads/site/thumbs/s980_site-1-1345978160_terradev1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To develop a game like Terra: Formations it requires some really big bucks to get it done and only Publishers can support such projects. This can limit the direction of a game, involve plenty of politics in relations during the development that can reduce the creativity involved to deliver a game that the developers really want to fully make. </p>
<p>Also the doors of what happens in games development is quite closed off but we are here to open them up to you as we move through the whole development cycle. Let us give you a window into our world here and help us to get Terra: Formations funded. </p>
<p>With crowdfunding and Indiegogo we have a chance here to bring you our vision of Terra: Formations. We want to keep you involved with us, give you updates as we make the game and value your support all the way.</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute funding but like what we are doing, please share this page with all your friends and even that will help us out in a great way!</p>
<h3>Has Terra: Formations been out before?</h3>
<p><img alt=""Terra Formations 2006 - 2012"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.starcave.net/uploads/site/thumbs/s980_site-1-1345979553_terra2006.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The game was announced back in 2006 for all major platforms from PC to Consoles and the screenshots you see in the Gallery tab at the top of this page is the playable demo from back then! We spared no expense to create ""AAA"" class graphics, code, game-play and pulled all-nighters with barely no lives at all. </p>
<p>To develop the whole game we needed a publisher and in the end Terra needed to be put on hold - until now! Terra brings together the best gaming genres in one unique way.</p>
<p>Now is the time to relaunch this fantastic genre-reaching project, and we need your support to make it onto your gaming platforms!</p>
<h3>So how will all this work? </h3>
<p><img alt=""Terra Formations Rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.starcave.net/uploads/site/thumbs/s980_site-1-1345980286_terrarewards1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can pick one of rewards and tell your friends to join in too. We have spent over $100,000 in the past on Terra: Formations and alot of our art-assets are still in good shape as we begin to convert them with the latest feature sets to our new ""AAA"" industry leading games engine. </p>
<p>To make sure the game gets completed and on time, we need to all think realistic here and we have set out the lowest budget we can to make the first tier incarnation of Terra. The game will have full FPS &amp; RTS elements with full on online multi-player game-play. With your support and we can exceed the funding goal, we will be able to add more levels, gameplay features, full single-player, and most of all.. the big one, the MMO side!! </p>
<p>Even creating a small Xbox downloadable game can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, a ""AAA"" game is in the millions and this is due to the amount of people involved with time to build, build and build. We are a small team but we have designed Terra to be a scalable game, and will be created and released in several stages, allowing us to get the game out there with whatever budget we secure. We can expand and step up production as funding permits. I am very proud of our small experienced team who know what they doing and work very, very hard. We are passionate about this game, and are determined to see it out there, giving all our players endless entertainment with our fantastic universe and revolutionary gameplay.</p>
<p>Some of us are working on other jobs but with your help on reaching the target - we can 100% focus on Terra: Formations all the way to end. </p>
<h3>When will Terra: Formations be completed?</h3>
<p>Based on our funding target, we would expect to nail the deadline for Beta Release in late 2013. We know exactly what we are doing, and as Terra has been many years in the making, we are confident in our deadlines!

In Terra: Formations, players have the freedom to select their preferred style of game play, ranging from intense action First-Person Shooter to more strategic RTS planning in an online multi-player universe.
As a player in Terra: Formations, you join the ranks of an elite military force with the objective of reshaping the environments of inhospitable worlds. You control the evolution of a developing planet (Europa Moon), and take command to become humanities only hope for survival in an epic struggle for control of the solar system. Four classes of characters offer different insight to the chaotic world, each providing a unique blend of interaction and gameplay perspectives.
The key concepts of Terra can be summarized by the conflicting species, player classes, life forms, technology, locations, and gameplay that are designed to make a genre hybrid, player driven world possible.

Terra: Formations main features:

Rich, highly detailed, atmospheric and wonderful alien enviroments

Changing environments reflecting your terraforming progress, becoming more habitable and supportive of your species requirements. Tug of War gameplay.

Permanent changes in environments - terraforming levels will remember your changes.

Groundbreaking genre crossing gameplay, combining First Person Shooter with Real-Time Strategy.

Highly detailed player characters, with customizable appearances

RTS online gameplay where you give real players control commands.

Advanced AI Droids for FPS defending & RTS resource play. 

4 distinct classes of characters; Soldier (FPS), Commander (RTS), Builder (FPS+RTS), and Medic (FPS).

Hi Tech Weaponry & Several Ground / Air Vehicles

Commander Special Attacks such as air-strikes, cloaking, superweapons.

Aliens have the ability to turn Humans by infestation into fellow Aliens.

Global online points & stats system.

Open Mod System allowing map makers to create new worlds.
Who is behind the game?
We are an indie games development studio called Starcave Entertainment, located in the west of Ireland. Our development office is within the Innovation Center of the National University of Ireland Galway. 
Founded by Keith Killilea, I enjoy creating stories & worlds that can capture people's imagination, attention and excitement. Since 1994 I have been creating video games on the Commodore 64 to PC / Consoles. Money is not a driving force for myself but to just see even one person having fun playing one of my creations!
It's about the stories, the user engagement within that fictional universe that is creative, fun & for a brief time you can leave your reality behind.
There is a few (six) of us involved here in the team that have 20+ years of games development experience. The Irish have a reputation of quality story-telling and entertainment - we will take this to a new level with Terra if you can kindly support us. 
See our company website for more information. 
Why Crowdfunding & Indiegogo?

To develop a game like Terra: Formations it requires some really big bucks to get it done and only Publishers can support such projects. This can limit the direction of a game, involve plenty of politics in relations during the development that can reduce the creativity involved to deliver a game that the developers really want to fully make. 
Also the doors of what happens in games development is quite closed off but we are here to open them up to you as we move through the whole development cycle. Let us give you a window into our world here and help us to get Terra: Formations funded. 
With crowdfunding and Indiegogo we have a chance here to bring you our vision of Terra: Formations. We want to keep you involved with us, give you updates as we make the game and value your support all the way.
Even if you can't contribute funding but like what we are doing, please share this page with all your friends and even that will help us out in a great way!
Has Terra: Formations been out before?

The game was announced back in 2006 for all major platforms from PC to Consoles and the screenshots you see in the Gallery tab at the top of this page is the playable demo from back then! We spared no expense to create ""AAA"" class graphics, code, game-play and pulled all-nighters with barely no lives at all. 
To develop the whole game we needed a publisher and in the end Terra needed to be put on hold - until now! Terra brings together the best gaming genres in one unique way.
Now is the time to relaunch this fantastic genre-reaching project, and we need your support to make it onto your gaming platforms!
So how will all this work? 

You can pick one of rewards and tell your friends to join in too. We have spent over $100,000 in the past on Terra: Formations and alot of our art-assets are still in good shape as we begin to convert them with the latest feature sets to our new ""AAA"" industry leading games engine. 
To make sure the game gets completed and on time, we need to all think realistic here and we have set out the lowest budget we can to make the first tier incarnation of Terra. The game will have full FPS & RTS elements with full on online multi-player game-play. With your support and we can exceed the funding goal, we will be able to add more levels, gameplay features, full single-player, and most of all.. the big one, the MMO side!! 
Even creating a small Xbox downloadable game can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, a ""AAA"" game is in the millions and this is due to the amount of people involved with time to build, build and build. We are a small team but we have designed Terra to be a scalable game, and will be created and released in several stages, allowing us to get the game out there with whatever budget we secure. We can expand and step up production as funding permits. I am very proud of our small experienced team who know what they doing and work very, very hard. We are passionate about this game, and are determined to see it out there, giving all our players endless entertainment with our fantastic universe and revolutionary gameplay.
Some of us are working on other jobs but with your help on reaching the target - we can 100% focus on Terra: Formations all the way to end. 
When will Terra: Formations be completed?
Based on our funding target, we would expect to nail the deadline for Beta Release in late 2013. We know exactly what we are doing, and as Terra has been many years in the making, we are confident in our deadlines! We will keep you in the loop with our development at all times, and give you a look into the process and progress we are making.
Just how ground breaking will Terra: Formations be?

Terra is going to invent a new style of game-play by blending the genres of FPS & RTS, With your help, we can exceed the funding target and and include the second tier of development, which is to incorporate the MMO side with RPG Adventure elements!! Even if we just hit the target, you can be sure Terra is going to be something special in gameplay, with unique alien environments and back story. 
We have been wanting to fully create Terra for over six years, it is you as gamers who have kept the name alive, the interest out there for it and we hear you. 
Example of how amazing Terra will be, your playing on the multi-player level and the world around not just changes due to the terra-forming but stays changed even when you return later to it! We want to bring you an experience of game-play not done before and a dynamic living world you would expect to be on.
Join us on a our wild ride to create this blockbuster game!

If you’ve always wanted to watch, experience and influence the game design process from start to finish, then this is your chance. We are holding nothing back with the title and having your input will help us make sure we cover every aspect in fine detail. 
We are incredibly excited to work on Terra that will bring something new, fresh and innovative to gamers. Our storyline will simply keep you on the edge of your seat, our environments will leave you in wonder and awe, and the game-play is going to give wow you like the first time you played any new genre style. 
This is an opportunity to help bring one special game to it's completion and be part of our extended team to making it happen!
Want more? Here is a taste of the story.
By the year 2157, mankind had depleted the resources of planet earth with his lust for power, technological advancements and greed. Ironically, the very machines that played a role in mankind's irrevocable position were the only chance of survival! 
After several years of uncertainty, hope was reborn with the efforts of the Global Military Alliance to Terraform one of earth's celestial neighbors, Jupiter's moon called 'Europa'. It wasn't until the excavation of the satellite's icy crust that mankind learned the truth; he was not alone and something, somewhere, was waiting, watching, learning and preparing for battle!

It’s a tough game, with puzzles somewhat reminiscent of old Zelda games. It’s conceived to challenge a variety of abilities
including reflection and abstraction skills, coordination, memory, timing, and
others.</p>
<p>The game will include:</p>

<p>I’m a Game Design student, and I’ve always been keen on developing videogames.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Someone may remember me
for being game designer of <i>Team
Summit</i>, student team semi-finalist at <i>Make
Something Unreal Live</i> contest 2013 with the game <i>Beings</i> (<a href=""http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2013/04/05/make-something-unreal-live-2013-contestants/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2013/04/05/make-something-unreal-live-2013-contestants/1</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">).</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span><p>Fearful Symmetry is the first completed game I’m supposed to publish. It started
as one of the many prototypes I usually develop for my own sake, but at some
point I saw the potential behind it, and I decided that I should complete it,
and share it with the world.</p>
<p>The game is not particularly big, but despite that I'm struggling to find the time to develop and polish the remaining assets. This leads to the next point...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439293665/chuifpycvhjs4ewvtsts.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As I said, I’m a student, and Fearful Symmetry is a project that I
started on my own, in my spare time. </p>
<p>I don't have the possibility to continue working full-time on developing the game, so my plan is to share the remaining workload with a talented friend of mine, Simone Onorato. Most of the budget will be used to hire him, so that he can stop looking for part-time jobs for a while, and focus on the game.</p>
<p>I’m also planning to release the game on Steam, so part of the budget will be used to pay the 100 $ Greenlight fee.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1300 $ is the bare minimum we need to complete the game as I imagined it. However, the scope of the game is not 100% defined, and with more funds we would be able to develop some more bonus levels to include in the regular version of the game.</p>
<p>To be more specific:</p>
<p>-If the campaign reaches 1500 $ we would add 2 more bonus levels</p>
<p>-If the campaign reaches 1700 $ we would add 1 more (aside from the previous 2 bonus levels)</p>
<p><br/></p>

Fearful Symmetry is a dynamic 2D pixelated puzzle game in which
the player controls two characters at the same time.



It’s a tough game, with puzzles somewhat reminiscent of old Zelda games. It’s conceived to challenge a variety of abilities
including reflection and abstraction skills, coordination, memory, timing, and
others.
The game will include:



20 levels set in 3 different environments


12 unique and fully animated traps


Emergent gameplay allowing creative
problem-solving


Roughly 8 hours of gameplay (depending on player’s
skills)


Progress auto-saving feature





I’m a Game Design student, and I’ve always been keen on developing videogames.


Someone may remember me
for being game designer of Team
Summit, student team semi-finalist at Make
Something Unreal Live contest 2013 with the game Beings (http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2013/04/05/make-something-unreal-live-2013-contestants/1).

Fearful Symmetry is the first completed game I’m supposed to publish. It started
as one of the many prototypes I usually develop for my own sake, but at some
point I saw the potential behind it, and I decided that I should complete it,
and share it with the world.
The game is not particularly big, but despite that I'm struggling to find the time to develop and polish the remaining assets. This leads to the next point...



As I said, I’m a student, and Fearful Symmetry is a project that I
started on my own, in my spare time. 
I don't have the possibility to continue working full-time on developing the game, so my plan is to share the remaining workload with a talented friend of mine, Simone Onorato. Most of the budget will be used to hire him, so that he can stop looking for part-time jobs for a while, and focus on the game.
I’m also planning to release the game on Steam, so part of the budget will be used to pay the 100 $ Greenlight fee.

1300 $ is the bare minimum we need to complete the game as I imagined it. However, the scope of the game is not 100% defined, and with more funds we would be able to develop some more bonus levels to include in the regular version of the game.
To be more specific:
-If the campaign reaches 1500 $ we would add 2 more bonus levels
-If the campaign reaches 1700 $ we would add 1 more (aside from the previous 2 bonus levels)


There are also a number of interesting perks available for you:





Fearful Friend - 1 $

           -Our gratitude : )



Early Bird (limited) - 3 $

            -DRM-FREE DIGITAL COPY OF THE GAME (when available)
            -Credited as a backer in-game 



Fearful Believer - 8 $

           -Our gratitude :)
           -Credited as a backer in game

           -DRM-free digital copy of the game (when available)





Symmetry Master - 15 $

           -Our gratitude :)
           -Credited as a backer in game
           -DRM-free digital copy of the game (when ready)
           -Special Indiegogo version of the game featuring an exclusive bonus level





The one who gives the names (limited) - 20 $

           All the above +
           -You can choose the name of one level (no swear words or profanities accepted, sorry)
           -You will be credited with special thanks in-game





Level Designer of Symmetry (limited) - 160 $

           All the above (excluding the ""names perk"") +
           -You can create a bonus level that will be featured in the game using the already existing assets
           -You will be credited as the Level Designer of that level in-game

Descrizione in italiano qui sotto





   
Il gioco
Fearful Symmetry è un gioco in 2D con grafica in pixel basato su enigmi e trabocchetti, in cui il giocatore comanda due personaggi contemporaneamente.

Il gioco è concepito per essere molto difficile e proporre sfide sempre nuove, aggiungendo anche un pizzico di nostalgia e allusioni a giochi classici come i vecchi Zelda. Il gioco mette alla prova la capacità di astrazione, di riflessione logica, di coordinazione, la memoria, i riflessi e anche altro. 
Il gioco includerà:

20 livelli ambientati in 3 scenari differenti
12 trappole dalle caratteristiche uniche, dettagliatamente animate
Gameplay emergente, e occasioni per esprimere la propria creatività nel problem-solving
Longevità di circa 8 ore (dipendente dalle abilità del giocatore)
Salvataggio automatico



Lo sviluppatore e il progetto
Sono uno studente di videogame design, e ho sempre avuto la passione del creare giochi.
Qualcuno potrebbe ricordarmi per il progetto a cui ho preso parte in occasione del concorso Make Something Unreal Live 2013, a cui ho partecipato come designer della squadra Team Summit, con il gioco Beings (http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2013/04/05/make-something-unreal-live-2013-contestants/1).      

Fearful Symmetry è il primo gioco che ho in progetto di pubblicare. Il progetto ha avuto inizio come tanti altri prototipi che mi capita di creare, ma ho visto del potenziale in questo, e ho deciso di provvedere per completarlo e condividerlo col mondo.
Il gioco non è particolarmente grande, ma, nonostante ciò, trovare il tempo necessario per completarlo non è facile. Questo ci porta al prossimo punto...


Quello che ci serve e quello che avrai in cambio
Come ho detto prima, sono uno studente, e Fearful Symmetry e un progetto che ho cominciato da solo, nel mio tempo libero.
Non ho la possibilità di continuare a lavorare a tempo pieno al gioco, quindi ho deciso di ingaggiare un mio talentuoso amico, Simone Onorato, per aiutarmi col lavoro rimanente. La maggior parte del budget richiesto sarà destinato a lui, per evitare che per un po' sia impegnato coi lavori part-time, così potrà anche lui concentrarsi sullo sviluppo del gioco.
Progetto anche di rilasciare il gioco su Steam, quindi parte del budget sarà usato per la tassa di 100 $ del Greenlight di Steam.
1300 $ è il minimo di cui abbiamo bisogno per completare il gioco così come lo avevo immaginato. Tuttavia, se ricevessimo ancora più contributi potremmo sviluppare qualche altro livello che abbiamo dovuto eliminare dal progetto per problemi di tempo.
Per essere più precisi:
-Se la campagna di raccolta fondi raggiunge i 1500 $ svilupperemo 2 livelli bonus 
-Se la campagna di raccolta fondi raggiunge i 1700 $ ne svilupperemo un ulteriore altro (a parte i precedenti 2)
Contribuendo sarà anche possibile aggiudicarsi una o più delle seguenti ricompense:
Fearful Friend - 1 $
           -La nostra gratitudine : )
Early Bird (limitato) - 3 $
            -COPIA DIGITALE (DRM-FREE) DEL GIOCO (quando sarà disponibile)

However, every donation – no matter how small it seems – helps us to make our most favourite event come to life once again!MILESTONES
12,500$ - Mission accomplished!
This is our main goal to make HSC XI happen in the first place - let's go!

15,000$ - Scarlett will be back!
It might have become a bit quiet on her lately but we will change this! If we reach 15,000$ we will invite Sasha ""Scarlett"" Hostyn as one of our hosts for HSC XI!
17,500$ - B-Stream by BasetradeTV
If we manage to reach the milestone of 17,500$, we will invite the guys from BasetradeTV and they'll provide the English B-stream for HSC XI on location!
20,000$ - Poker Action
We will set up a poker stream during the event to show you what's happening 'back stage'!
22,500$ - Behind the scenes
Ever wondered what it looks like when the crew is preparing a huge event like HSC? We will set up a stream behind the scenes that shows you the madness that's going on from Monday till Wednesday before HSC.
25,000$ - Broodwar / Legacy Tournament
For 25,000$ we will host a four-man tournament where competitors have to switch between Broodwar and Legacy of the Void after each map.
100,000$ - Let's go to Mallorca!
If you are crazy, so are we. We don't really plan on reaching this goal but if we do we will invite eight players to Mallorca, Spain, and hold a tournament there in addition to HSC XI - just because we can.

SPREAD THE WORDNot everyone is able to donate a big amount of money – but that’s totally fine! However, it would be much appreciated if you told your friends about this project – it only needs a minute of your time!Thanks for supporting HSC XI and TaKeTV!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div><strong>A Pathfinder adventure by way of Mad Libs?</strong></div>
<div><strong>Indie games you may not be able to get anywhere else?</strong></div>
<div><strong>Personal posessions of an old (school) designer?</strong></div>

<div>We have it all and more just for helping some nice guys keep thier newborn game company afloat and help them raise enough to pay some bills and maybe go to a convention or three!</div>
<h3>Howdy y'all!</h3>
<div>My name is Mike Nystul. I have been a professional game designer since I was in high school. That was a long time ago. Since then I have worked as a freelancer for something like thirty years. I worked in house as a developer for Mayfair Games, TSR and FASA. I spent some time away from the industry but came back last year, inspired by my kids to get back into gaming and back into the biz. Things have changed. The biggest change is that the market is even harder to break into but the good news was that there is a thriving audience for independents that use crowd sourcing to reach a wider audience eager for ingteresting work. </div>
<div>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>Here's the thing - I like to think I'm good at what I do, but what I'm not as good at as I would like to be is business. I stand by all of my design decisions but not all of my business decisions have been good ones. For example, rather than allow my new enterprise to grow slowly while I maintained a day job, I went ""all in"", set up a product line like I would have at FASA and hired top notch people like Jeff Laubenstein and Ross Issacs to help me realize my dreams. I also set up a convention without the cash in hand to pull it off. The up side is I now have a thriving studio with several lines about to launch and several more products in development. On that level, I accomplished what I set out to do. Unfortunately my appriach means I'm overextended and struggling to get everything out. We have a plan but we need the time and resources to implement it. </p>
<h3>What we have accomplished</h3>
<p>This adventure began with one man (me) deciding to get back into writing and designing. All cool. Simple. As things progressed, I discovered there was a market and an audience so I set about building a company. We now have things we needed from day 1 like productions schedules and workflows. We are in a position to kick ass and take names. So far we have - </p>
<p><strong>Nystul's Infinite Dungeon</strong>: A Megadungeon that will be released one volume at a time with. I'm doing print buying for Volume 1: The Blighted Isle.  </p>
<p><strong>Cairn</strong>: Fuzzy Fantasy with art by Jeff Laubenstein. Adventures with Lemur Archers and Badger Warriors that explore a world beset with discord and corruption. In layout and final art. This is a fun game and will be a beautoful book. Check out some art and updates <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CairnRPG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></p>
<p><strong>Axes and Anvils</strong>: Dwarven Roleplaying. All dwarves all the time. Play as members of a Clan whose adventures not only provide fortune and glory but can offer prosperity and influence to the Clan itself. The only game I know of that requires a Dwarven toast to qualify a critical hit! Check out our progress <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Axes-and-Anvils-RPG/567943019887552"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a></p>
<p>We have several projects in the works for each product line and something like 4 board and card games in development as well as a few new rpg properties. </p>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>Essentially, a war chest. I ran three successful Kickstarters but as many pundits have pointed out, success carries it's own burdens. I brought on more overhead than I should have, it took longer to deliver than it should have and there have been and continue to be endless hidden costs that gnaw away at us. I have read that something like 40% of all funded RPG projects never deliver and most of those never even offer refunds. Because of this climate and how long it has taken us to deliver on our initial offerings we are facing fears of vaporware. I will not allow anything like that to happen.</p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Donate to the Build the Castle fund. We will use anything collected to pay bills and get things done. You will be helping us keep the balls in the air and the wolves at the door long enough to get everything to market and the cash flow flowing. Everyone I am working with is very excited about the work we are doing and we want to keep doing what we do together. </p>
<p>Spread the word. Not everone is in a position to help financially. No problem. Help us to find those who willing and able. With the new Facebook regulations being what they are this is now harder than ever and requires some grass roots help to get the word out.</p>
<p>If you are a designer or artist - volunteer to contribute to the Corwdsourced Adventure. This will be a wild ride. The less it costs us, the better and the better it is - the better for everyone!</p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>I have set up some premiums to say ""thank you"" to anyone who helps out. Amoung these are copies of our first three games, all of which are poised to launch on RPG Now and as physical copies to the backers of the original projects. I have added some fun stuff because this is gaming dammit and it should be fun first and foremost!  </p>
<h2>The Crowdsourced Adventure</h2>
<p>A key part of this fund (fun?) raiser is an off the wall Pathfinder adventure that will be designed around a crowdsourced introduction. We will try to add designers and artists as we go. The result should be a bizarre 8 page one shot that everyone will get in PDF form. If response is good we may have to go higher : ) </p>
<p><strong>More than [AMOUNT OF TIME] ago the [NAME OF GROUP] arrived on the shores of [NAME OF COUNTRY]. They arived in search of [GOAL] but met with [INITIAL CONFLICT]. Thier leader, [NAME OF LEADER] sent the [HEROIC TRAIT] hero [HERO NAME] on a quest for [QUEST GOAL].

For those contribute higher amount, I will build game app for you free. All the  income generated from advertisement monetization inside the app will go back to your Paypal account monthly. So, you can start to earn passive income from it.
If you contribution to my campaign, you are actually doing some charity for community in the long run. I will email you all the donation proof receipt each time money is donated.

*Game Development Income - refer to earning from providing game development service for others and advertisement monetization income inside app.

*Advertisement Monetization Income - refer to earning from advertisement monetization channel such as Admob, Chartboost, Revmob, iAds and more.


My Goals

Here's what I'm promise to do on each level of contribution achieve:
$2,675 (cost to buy the game builder software)When reach $2,675 in funding, I will donate 10% of my game development income every half-yearly to World Vision Charity Organisation for the period of 1 year.
$5,000 (cost to get macbook for AppStore publishing and some graphic resources pack for game development)When reach $5,000 in funding, I will donate 15% of my game development income every half-yearly to World Vision Charity Organisation for the period of 2 year.
$15,000 (employ one staff to develop game)When
 reach $15,000 in funding, I will donate 20% of my game development 
income every half-yearly to World Vision Charity Organisation for the 
period of 3 year.

$30,000 (start my game development business)When
 reach $30,000 in funding, i will start my own game developing in bigger scale, employ more staff to build more game app in shorter time. For this, I will donate 30% of my game development 
income every half-yearly to World Vision Charity Organisation for the 
period of 5 year.

 Risks & ChallengesIf funding is successful, I need 1 to 2 months to familiar with this software. Most probably I can start publish game app to store after the first month. Monetization income will probably come in 3rd  or 4th month.For those contribute higher amount and get a free game app, please do allow me to delivery within 3 to 6 months time after the campaign is successfully funded.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. You can help me by:

<font size=""4"">Monsterhearts is a story game about the messy lives of teenage monsters.</font><br/>
</h3>
<p>Monsterhearts lets you and your friends create stories about sexy monsters, creeping horror, messy love triangles, and teenage angst. When you play, you explore the terror and confusion that comes both with growing up and, say, being a undead flesh-eater. Or bartering with demonic forces. Or being an unstable werewolf.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The game runs on the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apocalypse World</span> engine, designed by Vincent Baker. As a result, the two games share similarities in play style: emergent story, messy relationship webs, mechanics that give players hard choices to make, and a structured MC role.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's designed to evoke stories like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">True Blood</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</span>, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ginger Snaps</span> or <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Twilight Saga</span>. If you like supernatural romances, or stories of monstrosity and personal horror, or if you just like watching sexy people ruin their lives, then you'll love this game.</p>

<h3>Who are we, and what is this game?</h3>
<p>We are ZebraLightning Studios, and we have been making mobile games for two years now. We have 6 games thus far on the Google Play market, and would like to bring you another one! Our team for this project now has the opportunity to bring you a lighthearted, super fun game!</p>
<p>We who are working on this project have recently gotten an opportunity to start developing our craziest game yet! Since normally, business ""stuff"" keeps us from being able to blaze through and have as much fun as possible, we would love to spill our hearts to make a game just for you. With this opportunity, we can make a game that we think everyone can enjoy, while polishing the snot out of it!</p>
<p>But what exactly do you do in Squirrely Diver? Well, if you've played Temple Run, or One Epic Knight, it's pretty similar to those, except we're going with a top-down 2D style with it. It's an endless runner type of game, where you just keep going collecting items and such, trying to get a high score, until you die. We plan on having items and such to pick up as you're going, so look forward to an action packed run through the game!</p>
<p>With <strong>your </strong>generosity, you can help us finish this game and provide a great time for everybody! With the resources we can get with the funding, we can make the funniest, squirrel parodied, endless runner, <strong>thing </strong>of ALL TIME!</p>
<p>SQUIRRELLYYY DIVEEEERRRRR! YYYYEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHH!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $3500 for the funding we need is to finish the game entirely, within the next month and polish it to the best of our abilities. Unfortunately, in order for the three of us to focus on this game, we are needing the funding to complete it.</p>
<p>If we do manage to get triple the amount we're asking for, we can go beyond what we're trying to do, and take this into a 3D environment! This could include better levels, added objectives, and more Squirrely Diver ACTION!<br/>Of course, any funding in between our initial goal and the 3D upgrade goal will go towards getting more levels for a story mode, costumes for Squirrely, songs for the soundtrack, and the best laughs for all!<br/>And for the bad news part, if we don't get to the goal... If we don't get all the way to the goal, it doesn't mean the end of the world. It'll just take a bit longer to get the game done. We will still be working on it, and making sure everything goes as smooth as possible, while still trying to balance the business responsibilities that will inevitably start pressuring us.</p>
<p>For the first few perks we have, we will provide basic things like being in the Special Thanks, song downloads, wallpapers, and unlocking the costumes we have planned for Squirrely. Higher perks include things like physical soundtracks, signed art, and even our stuffed tiger!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What this project contributes to the world is something we feel is underrated... Laughter. When all the world's problems are solved there will still be a need for laughter. Although this isn't the end all be all of tear-jerking comedy, it sure had us in tears coming up with the idea! We just want to give everyone something to laugh about, while enjoying a great game at the same time.</p>
<p>Every project we have started here at ZebraLightning we have finished, and although they are not triple A game titles, Squirrely Diver is well within the project scope of what we have already completed.</p>
</div>
<div>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>I figured out that I really enjoy making cardboard electronic toys, and I have returned to dabbling in amateur video game design. Empowered with the likes of the <a href=""http://www.makeymakey.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MaKey MaKey</a> and <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scratch</a>, I have set on a mission to create DIY cardboard toys that are also video game controllers for custom mini games.</p>
<p>I call this mission the ""Cardboard Entertainment System.""</p>
<h3><strong>8-Bit joke, OK we get it. But are you a Certified Cardboard Video Game Engineer?</strong></h3>
<p>I am not, due to there being no such thing. Don't be a silly person. I have worked in specialty electronics in previous jobs and have been dabbling in programming and game design since ~high school. I'm having a blast and I know these games are going to be great perks for my sponsors.</p>
<p>I am going to be putting special personal touches into each order, and that's where the real magic happens.<br/><br/>I am an enthusiastic tinkerer and a member of my local Makerspace/Hackerspace at <a href=""http://www.knoxmakers.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Knox Makers</a> where I have been further pursuing my interests.</p>
<h3><strong>What got you started on this wild endeavor?</strong></h3>
<p>I learned about MaKey MaKey from <a href=""http://blog.makezine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MAKE</a> and about Scratch in a <a href=""http://learn.media.mit.edu/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Learning Creative Learning</a> open public MOOC put on by MIT. I figured out how to make a MaKey MaKey version of the classic video game <a href=""http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/3297665/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pong</a> (see More Resources below) and have been branching out to test my own twists on some of my other favorite video game genres and game mechanics. </p>
<p>I decided to make a unique video game experience for a friend's birthday using the MaKey MaKey, Scratch, some basic electronic supplies, and cardboard. They were entirely blown away, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I was left with a strong drive to do this same thing for random strangers across the globe.</p>
<p><em><strong>If anyone can do it, why is this on Indiegogo?</strong></em><br/><br/>In fact, a first goal is to get enough funding so that I can develop and release the free open source instructions for all of the cardboard video game controllers that work with the free online video games I will be producing in Scratch.</p>
<p>These controllers/toys will be designed in ways that require little or no experience, and full kits cost $100 each for early adopters (plus shipping and handling for international orders), and much less if the user already has a MaKey MaKey. I am also including a package for just a personalized video game, no controller included. $1 donations are also accepted, which comes with a very grateful thank-you e-mail. Also, expect secret perks that appear in the wild temporarily (unless unlocked permanently by getting purchased before they disappear).<br/><br/>This is a unique project that aims to work hard to reward adopters with personalized video game experiences, and I'm diving in headfirst to tackle all the extra content and features I can. <br/><br/><em>That's why I think this belongs on Indiegogo.</em></p>
<h2><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">So what exactly are you trying to fund?</strong></h2>
<p>I am including packages to cover these areas (described in more detail below):</p>
<ul>
<li>Free mini-games for all</li>
<li>Free DIY instructions and extra content in digital format for all</li>
<li>Free video game background songs for all</li>
<li>Pre-made unassembled kits including wires, conductive materials, LEDs, and other components (with 1 MaKey MaKey)</li>
<li>Pre-made unassembled kits (without MaKey MaKey)</li>
<li>Custom personalized mini game experience</li>
<li>Secret perks that appear in the wild..</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why sell kits without the MaKey MaKey core?</strong></h3>
<p>It's important to me that I stay open to people who already own a MaKey MaKey or want to use an alternative Arduino or other microcontroller, and that I release the plans for free so that anyone can build or hack the design.</p>
<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Alternative microcontrollers, you say?</strong></h3>
<p>Armed with as little as 1 MaKey MaKey or microcontroller running the MK sketch file and a few basic electronic components, anyone can have their own custom Cardboard Entertainment System with a virtually limitless and costless sea of peripheral possibilities. You won't have to order MaKey MaKey from me, and you won't even have to order any MaKey MaKeys at all. If you want, you can try putting the MK sketch on your own compatible microcontroller and hack one of my designs for a custom video game controller that works with all the games (or even invent your own), without ever paying me a dime. That's great! Sharing's what MK and Scratch are all about, but this project doesn't even skim the surface of either's potential. I encourage hacking any of this project, as much as I love and vastly appreciate my supporters. Enjoy and have fun tinkering!</p>
<p>Additionally, for the mini Flash games, the main thing will be the keyboard signals that the controller can send to a computer via USB. The actual design can wildly vary from what I initially come up with, so you can reinvent your custom controller however you want as many times as you like.</p>
<p>And since all the games will be using the same controls, you can even play all the other games that get made in this project with your controller, too. Results may vary as some games will be oriented with specific controllers in mind.</p>
<h3><strong>Didn't some kid already do cardboard games and get flashmobbed?</strong></h3>
<p>I want to donate 10 percent of the total funds raised to <a href=""https://imagination.nationbuilder.com/donate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Imagination Foundation</a> on behalf of <a href=""http://cainesarcade.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Caine's Arcade</a>. This is important to me because Caine is an inspiring kid hero of cardboard games and I like what the Imagination Foundation does and is about. Caine's Arcade helped pave the way for cardboard game inventors all across the world.</p>
<p>I'd say that's a noble feat more worthy of being in the pages of our history books than some things out there these days, and definitely worth donating 10 percent of the funds I raise.</p>
<h3><strong>What's the scope of this project and how does it scale out?</strong></h3>
<p>I might make a few controllers and games in this project, I might make a hundred. I'm prepared to scale up or down as needed, but even at a maximum cap of what I can do in a day by myself I quickly run into time constraints if things get out of hand. If this project becomes too big for me to do alone and get everyone's rewards to them in a timely manner, I'll recruit friends and fellow tinkerers and turn it into a larger scale production. I already have several types of game genres and basic game mechanics already mapped out and created, and each mini-game will vary in a unique and substantive way from one of the basic game types.</p>
<p>For instance, one game type is a basic and short RPG. Using my RPG game mechanics template, I can make several different custom stories with unique sprites and maps all from the same starting template. This will help reduce my time and let me get a lot more quality creative planning done for each order without anything coming out unfinished or like it came off of a cheap assembly line.</p>
<h3><strong>Ideal funding goal?</strong></h3>
<p>I am not too worried about how successful this will be, only that I complete the orders that I get with special personal touches for each. It is important to me that I try and infuse each controller and game with a little something personal, so I will ask each donor with such a package a few questions to try and make a very custom experience for them.</p>
<p>This also makes excellent opportunities to have a custom video game experience dedicated to a loved one for their birthday or other special time. I will accept photos to incorporate such as pictures of pets, pictures of your home and favorite places, pictures of friends and family, custom sounds and voiceovers, and other media that may help make the experience more personal for you.*</p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What Do You Need &amp; What Do I Get?</span></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need MaKey MaKeys, lots of electronic components and supplies (LEDs, servo motors, buzzers, wires, conductive adhesive copper tape, knobs, buttons, etc.), art supplies, and cardboard.</p>
<p>You get access to DIY plans and all the mini games I can publish live (I need a permission/waiver from anyone included in any submitted photos). Even if I only make a few projects, everyone will have access to all open source and Creative Commons content.</p>
<p>I will be producing unique electronic music for each game. I will also include other content and features that everyone will have access to.<br/><br/>If you order a toy and game, you will have the pleasure of a unique and custom experience designed just for you. You will be able to do things like choose character and monster names, invent items that will appear in the game, and help shape what your cardboard toy ends up looking like.<br/><br/><em><strong>What happens if you fail?</strong></em></p>
<p>If I don't get the full $1000.00 funded, it only means I have to scale back my order of MaKey MaKeys and other supplies, which wouldn't affect my costs enough to sink the project. I can do as little as $1, as I already have one MK and supplies and can at least make something to show and provide digital DIY instructions about. I'd like to get at least five orders for custom controllers and games, though.<br/><br/>Heck, I'll continue making my own video games and controllers even if I get $0.00 funded. It'd be cool to take some orders for others, however. I imagine making a silly fighting game for someone where they can select their pets as characters, or an RPG about someone's childhood experience.</p>
<h2>I'm concerned about your realism.</h2>
<p>I am trying to juggle a few things here. This is mostly a fun research project. My sponsors will be blown away, but this will mostly be due to personalization. Please don't expect a video game experience akin to the visual quality of next console gaming. Think retro gaming, with some modern twists. Again, personalized orders are paying for personalized experiences, not bleeding-edge gaming. This is going to reek of homebrew, but that's part of the appeal. If quirky but personalized ghetto cardboard video game controllers, weird music, and amateur retro gaming do not appeal to you, this might not be a good campaign for you to throw bones at. Fair warning, because that's the kind of stuff I live for!</p>

</div></div>","What?
I figured out that I really enjoy making cardboard electronic toys, and I have returned to dabbling in amateur video game design. Empowered with the likes of the MaKey MaKey and Scratch, I have set on a mission to create DIY cardboard toys that are also video game controllers for custom mini games.
I call this mission the ""Cardboard Entertainment System.""
8-Bit joke, OK we get it. But are you a Certified Cardboard Video Game Engineer?
I am not, due to there being no such thing. Don't be a silly person. I have worked in specialty electronics in previous jobs and have been dabbling in programming and game design since ~high school. I'm having a blast and I know these games are going to be great perks for my sponsors.
I am going to be putting special personal touches into each order, and that's where the real magic happens.I am an enthusiastic tinkerer and a member of my local Makerspace/Hackerspace at Knox Makers where I have been further pursuing my interests.
What got you started on this wild endeavor?
I learned about MaKey MaKey from MAKE and about Scratch in a Learning Creative Learning open public MOOC put on by MIT. I figured out how to make a MaKey MaKey version of the classic video game Pong (see More Resources below) and have been branching out to test my own twists on some of my other favorite video game genres and game mechanics. 
I decided to make a unique video game experience for a friend's birthday using the MaKey MaKey, Scratch, some basic electronic supplies, and cardboard. They were entirely blown away, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I was left with a strong drive to do this same thing for random strangers across the globe.
If anyone can do it, why is this on Indiegogo?In fact, a first goal is to get enough funding so that I can develop and release the free open source instructions for all of the cardboard video game controllers that work with the free online video games I will be producing in Scratch.
These controllers/toys will be designed in ways that require little or no experience, and full kits cost $100 each for early adopters (plus shipping and handling for international orders), and much less if the user already has a MaKey MaKey. I am also including a package for just a personalized video game, no controller included. $1 donations are also accepted, which comes with a very grateful thank-you e-mail. Also, expect secret perks that appear in the wild temporarily (unless unlocked permanently by getting purchased before they disappear).This is a unique project that aims to work hard to reward adopters with personalized video game experiences, and I'm diving in headfirst to tackle all the extra content and features I can. That's why I think this belongs on Indiegogo.
So what exactly are you trying to fund?
I am including packages to cover these areas (described in more detail below):

Free mini-games for all
Free DIY instructions and extra content in digital format for all
Free video game background songs for all
Pre-made unassembled kits including wires, conductive materials, LEDs, and other components (with 1 MaKey MaKey)
Pre-made unassembled kits (without MaKey MaKey)
Custom personalized mini game experience
Secret perks that appear in the wild..

Why sell kits without the MaKey MaKey core?
It's important to me that I stay open to people who already own a MaKey MaKey or want to use an alternative Arduino or other microcontroller, and that I release the plans for free so that anyone can build or hack the design.
Alternative microcontrollers, you say?
Armed with as little as 1 MaKey MaKey or microcontroller running the MK sketch file and a few basic electronic components, anyone can have their own custom Cardboard Entertainment System with a virtually limitless and costless sea of peripheral possibilities. You won't have to order MaKey MaKey from me, and you won't even have to order any MaKey MaKeys at all. If you want, you can try putting the MK sketch on your own compatible microcontroller and hack one of my designs for a custom video game controller that works with all the games (or even invent your own), without ever paying me a dime. That's great! Sharing's what MK and Scratch are all about, but this project doesn't even skim the surface of either's potential. I encourage hacking any of this project, as much as I love and vastly appreciate my supporters. Enjoy and have fun tinkering!
Additionally, for the mini Flash games, the main thing will be the keyboard signals that the controller can send to a computer via USB. The actual design can wildly vary from what I initially come up with, so you can reinvent your custom controller however you want as many times as you like.
And since all the games will be using the same controls, you can even play all the other games that get made in this project with your controller, too. Results may vary as some games will be oriented with specific controllers in mind.
Didn't some kid already do cardboard games and get flashmobbed?
I want to donate 10 percent of the total funds raised to Imagination Foundation on behalf of Caine's Arcade. This is important to me because Caine is an inspiring kid hero of cardboard games and I like what the Imagination Foundation does and is about. Caine's Arcade helped pave the way for cardboard game inventors all across the world.
I'd say that's a noble feat more worthy of being in the pages of our history books than some things out there these days, and definitely worth donating 10 percent of the funds I raise.
What's the scope of this project and how does it scale out?
I might make a few controllers and games in this project, I might make a hundred. I'm prepared to scale up or down as needed, but even at a maximum cap of what I can do in a day by myself I quickly run into time constraints if things get out of hand. If this project becomes too big for me to do alone and get everyone's rewards to them in a timely manner, I'll recruit friends and fellow tinkerers and turn it into a larger scale production. I already have several types of game genres and basic game mechanics already mapped out and created, and each mini-game will vary in a unique and substantive way from one of the basic game types.
For instance, one game type is a basic and short RPG. Using my RPG game mechanics template, I can make several different custom stories with unique sprites and maps all from the same starting template. This will help reduce my time and let me get a lot more quality creative planning done for each order without anything coming out unfinished or like it came off of a cheap assembly line.

I will accept photos to incorporate such as pictures of pets, pictures of your home and favorite places, pictures of friends and family, custom sounds and voiceovers, and other media that may help make the experience more personal for you.*
What Do You Need & What Do I Get?


I need MaKey MaKeys, lots of electronic components and supplies (LEDs, servo motors, buzzers, wires, conductive adhesive copper tape, knobs, buttons, etc.), art supplies, and cardboard.
You get access to DIY plans and all the mini games I can publish live (I need a permission/waiver from anyone included in any submitted photos). Even if I only make a few projects, everyone will have access to all open source and Creative Commons content.

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>How far is the game a long?</strong></p>
<p>Its single player component is almost completed.<br/>Connecting multiple players works but is hardy in alpha stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How many levels are in the singleplayer campaign?<br/></strong><br/>I plan to release with 18 levels. <br/>The first levels can be finished rather quick and are intended to learn new abilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When is the game ready for release?</strong></p>
<p>Since I work only half-time in order to get by, development time is hard to predict.<br/>It is possible I release a single player version first and multiplayer as free DLC after. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why are there no physical rewards like hats, t-shirts or figurines?</strong></p>
<p>I rather use the money people contribute for my game.</p>
<p>  </p>
<p><strong>What happens if you do not reach the funding goal?</strong></p>
<p>I am running a dynamic campaign what means I get any money that is contributed even if I miss the goal.<br/>Since Spheritis is already so far done you will have the game reward.<br/>But it will not be the way I prefer to release it, probably missing some of the items that I run this campaign for. And most likely a later release.</p>

The single play campaign features 7 different ball types and 7 special enhancements, 4 difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and Challenge Mode) and leader boards.
The game used the Unity 3D engine and will run on PC, Mac and Linux.
 

What this project needs:
As you can see in the videos the game is near the end of production for the single player campaign. But its not done yet and I am out of funds.While I am not sure if I even am going to make break even on this game I still want to go on and finish the game in a proper manner.
So where will the funds go?

Music for the game.
Polishing of the game, buying additional assets and tools form Unity's asset store.
Completion of the last single player levels.
Achievements.
Translations.
Linux and Mac implementation.
Save game support.
...
 
And if I raise more then the project its goal?

Gamepad controller support.
Multi play experiments.
...
 
What you get:

Since this game is this far done I can guarantee you will get at least something in return.  The game in its current form will keep you busy for quite some time already.
The perks:



Fan
Early Bird
Digital Game
Early Access
Symbol Reward
Future
Corporate
Guardian Angel

 
Other Ways You Can Help
You like my game and like to help in other ways as well?You can do this by:

Spread the word about this game to your friends by liking it on Facebook or following me on twitter.
Mention the game to any friends in the game media :)


 
 
FAQ
How far is the game a long?
Its single player component is almost completed.Connecting multiple players works but is hardy in alpha stage.
 
How many levels are in the singleplayer campaign?I plan to release with 18 levels. The first levels can be finished rather quick and are intended to learn new abilities.
 
When is the game ready for release?
Since I work only half-time in order to get by, development time is hard to predict.It is possible I release a single player version first and multiplayer as free DLC after. 
 
Why are there no physical rewards like hats, t-shirts or figurines?
I rather use the money people contribute for my game.
  
What happens if you do not reach the funding goal?
I am running a dynamic campaign what means I get any money that is contributed even if I miss the goal.Since Spheritis is already so far done you will have the game reward.But it will not be the way I prefer to release it, probably missing some of the items that I run this campaign for. And most likely a later release.

<p><strong>Q:</strong> What platforms do you support?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A: </b>iOS - Devices with iOS version 7.0+</p>
<p>Android - HDPI devices with Android 4.4+ with a front-facing camera. Devices should have a capable CPU (armv7a and NEON support). Example: Samsung Galaxy S3 or above.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:20px;border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;padding-bottom:10px;""></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Since the product is designed for kids, is it safe and compliant with international toy standards?</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:20px;border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;padding-bottom:10px;""><strong>A:</strong> Once the hand sampling and tooling is done, we will work towards the safety inspection tests. We have designed the product to ensure that it complies with the <a href=""http://www.bsci-intl.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Business Social Compliance Initiative</a> (BSCI) safety standards and the product will undergo several tests to ensure that it is safe for use by children above the ages of three.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I become a beta tester?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We have a small group of beta testers that we will contact when we are close to finalising the app. We will reach out to early backers who have an iPad and ask them to help out in the testing of the product. </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you need $25,000?
</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:20px;border-bottom:1px dotted #ccc;padding-bottom:10px;""><strong>A:</strong> We need to order a minimum number of units for the manufacturer to take on the project.

We also plan on spending time on the ground in the production run phase to ensure that the product meets our requirements and we have no developmental issues or delays.
</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is money the only obstacle you have or are there more obstacles? Is raising funds for this product the only challenge you’re facing?
</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Design, packaging, product samples, prototyping and app development is all done. We have engaged a toy manufacturer who has over 35 years experience in the industry and are using their expertise to help guide us in the development process. We’re now ready and eager to go into manufacturing which is why we need your help.</p>
<p>Raising money for a product that hasn’t been validated by the market is always a challenge for anyone. We’re confident of the product we’ve made, based on the initial testing we have done with children and parents, we believe that we have created something truly unique. Validation from our community will definitely make the road toward greater investment easier.</p>

Your support means the world to us, you are truly someone who appreciates big ideas with a lot of heart.  Please spread the word and help other parents discover The AppyKids Interactive Play Kit.

The challenges and risks that are ahead of us as we finalise the development and delivery of the Play Kit are related to manufacturing and logistics.



        There may be slight variations in the colours based on our transition from the prototypes used in the photos and video to the final manufactured product.
    

        There may be changes to the final dimensions or specifications of some of the parts as we optimise the design for mass production and / or adhere to standards.
    
There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen product changes that require additional development or addition to the scope of our manufacturing time line.
    
There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances in international shipping and logistics.
    
Shipments may be subject to import duties and other local taxes.

If there are any changes to the Play Kit, we will communicate these changes to our contributors in a timely manner.

<h3>What will the Castle Have to Offer?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A library of hundreds of games, available for $5/person a day for unlimited play</li>
<li>A positive space to interact one-on-one with friends and family</li>
<li>Light fare, from popcorn and pastries to paninis</li>
<li>Delicious beverages- we'll have a full coffee bar and are planning to have a beer and wine license for some casual adult beverages </li>

<p>As we said above, this book is essentially ready to go. The text has been written, added, and laid out, and all the art is in place. Aside from a final cover, which will be produced in-house, this book is ready to go!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have a great deal of experience in the field of games publishing, and we think we can deliver this project without problems.</p>
<p>However, things can go wrong with anything that goes into a manufacturing process. We have identified that delays in manufacturing could happen, so we have allowed additional time in our schedule to enable us to navigate any delay issues. If all goes to plan, we may even be able to deliver the project a little sooner.</p>

</div></div>","Al-Shirkuh has its share of warriors and wise men, clerics and sorcerers, healers and harmers, peasants and nobles, commanders and cowards, and merchants and rogues. This is a land where men and women can choose to walk beside the gods or follow their own path to enlightenment, converse with mighty and capricious jinn or damn them to oblivion, live with the desert or tolerate its presence.

Most have no great destiny. They are born, grow old, and die without ever seeing the many wonders or facing the endless perils the desert has to offer. This is all they will ever know, and in that they are content. Others, though, strive for greatness. Their names may be unknown to storytellers and sages for now, but there will come a time when their deeds will be counted among those of the heroes of old.
This supplement contains 50 characters, both villainous and heroic, ready to be dropped into any Hellfrost: Land of Fire or Arabian Nights-style game or used as player characters.
To make life easy for the reader, each character's statistics, background, description, mannerisms, and image fits on a single page.
Shipping, when applicable, is automatically added when you pledge.
 



We're looking to fund a 50-page, 8.5"" x 11"" softcover, saddle-stitched book.
The writing, art, and layout for this book is already complete. We're seeking funding to produce print copies.



Please check out our recommended pledge levels below!

 

We'll be shipping the physical book from either the USA or the EU depending on your location. Shipping costs are as follows:
USA - $9
UK - $5
EU - $9
ROW - $9

 


Triple Ace Games began in 2008. The masterminds behind the company, Paul ""Wiggy"" Wade-Williams and Robin Elliott, had previously worked on The Savage World of Solomon Kane andSlipstream settings, among others, for Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Triple Ace Games has produced many popular settings, including Hellfrost, Leagues of Adventure, Leagues of Gothic Horror, and All for One: Regime Diabolique, plus the Rocket Race, Cadaver, and Halfling Feast card games. With many years of experience in the games industry, we continue to create fantastic games for everyone.

Risks & Challenges

As we said above, this book is essentially ready to go. The text has been written, added, and laid out, and all the art is in place. Aside from a final cover, which will be produced in-house, this book is ready to go!
 
We have a great deal of experience in the field of games publishing, and we think we can deliver this project without problems.
However, things can go wrong with anything that goes into a manufacturing process. We have identified that delays in manufacturing could happen, so we have allowed additional time in our schedule to enable us to navigate any delay issues. If all goes to plan, we may even be able to deliver the project a little sooner.
We understand the printing process as we have printed a good number of books previous to this project, and we know how to communicate our ideas to the printer. We have discussed proofing requirements, so we know that when the printing press is started our book will match our specification requirements.
With projects like this there is nearly always something that costs more so it is good business sense to have some contingency for this, which we have built in to our costs.

You will be plunged together with illo into an uncharted territory governed by dynamics you’ll need to master in order to survive and progress. You’ll witness illo’s premature awakening in the wrong place: an unexplored environment filled with weird and wonderful creatures. The sequence of events is neither modular nor foreseeable: a unique wonderland. You'll need to act quickly, wait patiently, observe, think, discover, transform, lock, blow, rush, fall, swim and much more that we’d love to share with you, but we don't want to spoil your surprise. Your ""WOW"" is our goal.
Why are we on indiegogo?
We need your help to produce a playable demo of illo birth of the cool to prove how absolutely wonderful and original this game is.Major publishers are asking us for a demo, but this project’s GAMEPLAY, MUSIC and ART are top-quality and much more complex than may seem. That’s why we can’t produce a demo without your funding. Publishers want to try out illo so be a part of our chance to amaze them!
 

theAndroidSoul:”..the game definitely does have a fresh and unique look,.. ..creative interactivity,.. ..intriguing artwork and gameplay..”.
 

gamefanatics:”..illo, one of the cutest ”blobs” you’ll probably ever see..”.
 

BLACKMAN’N ROBIN: ”Fan of pretty, artsy games? You’re going to want to check out illo – birth of the cool. It looks beautiful”.

Platforms:
illo birth of the cool will first be developed for PC, iOS and Android, then we're going to bring the game on Ouya and Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo systems too. A playable demo can make this possible.
Estimated time frame:
4 Months for the demo (since we get funded), 12 months for the game (since publisher signature), but you will immediately receive the perks along with the playable demo!
1 Why fund illo birth of the cool.
If you, too, think that very few games today are truly entertaining and original and, just like us, you’d want more, help us finance the playable demo of illo birth of the cool and we’ll be able to obtain funds to develop the full game: original and enjoyable as few others. Help us entertain you!

The circle could be considered the ""middle ground"" of the three shapes, as it has medium walking speed. With this one you'll be able to defeat the heavy square type enemies, but you'll have to be careful with the triangle ones, they're very sharp, ouch!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Triangle Flatman</b> is the speedster. He can run faster than the other two, but you'll have less control over your movement, so watch your step! You'll cover great distances with this form, so take advantage of its speed. As triangle you'll have the power to beat the balloon like circle enemies, but you can be defeated with ease by the strong square type enemies, they're a though bunch!</p>
<p></p>

<p>Last but not least, is <b>Square Flatman</b>. This shape is the slowest and heaviest, but also the strongest and sturdiest. He can sink underwater like a rock, and his might is pretty formidable. He's able to push heavy objects and cause great harm. The Square can crush the feeble triangle types, but look out for those circle types, they can make you loose your balance!</p>
<p>By combining the three shapes, you can explore the whole Flat Kingdom and discover all kinds of secrets. After each level you'll acquire <b>different upgrades for new skills!</b> Use them wisely!</p>
<p>The worlds are big and full of secrets and surprises! So you'll have plenty to do and discover while you reach your goal.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Being our first<b> big project</b> as a team, we are facing a lot of new challenges that we must learn to overcome. We are using our skills in animation, illustration, programming and design in this 1 year and a half project.</p>
<p>To be  honest, the videogame industry is not really that serious (not to say non existent) in this little corner of the world (Mérida, Yucatán), so it's though to get local support and investment. This is mainly why we are here, because <b>we want to encourage more indie video game startups in Latin America and in all parts of the world.</b></p>
<p>We love what we do and we love videogames. We are having fun developing this, so we hope you'll have fun playing it. Our motto is <b>""develop the games we would like to play ourselves"".</b></p>

</div></div>","Our first demo is ready! Click to play and tell us what you think! all your comments and feedback are greatly appreciated!
Note that this is not the full first world (it's not even close!). It's just a little sample of the game for you to test it and get a better feel for the mechanic and characters!









Flatman is a 2.5D platform and puzzle game. In this game you'll be able to change into 3 different shapes: triangle, circle and square. With these forms you'll have different abilities and ways of solving puzzles and battling your enemies. It's fun to experiment and see what works best on what!





The game is scheduled for release in Spring 2015 for PC and Mac platforms.




        
HOW DO I PLAY THIS?You have 3 shapes to play as, each one changing the gameplay dramatically!


Use your skills to explore and overcome challenges, experiment and see what happens!







Discover your enemies’ weaknesses, combat in rock, paper, scissors style!


Defeat giant bosses using all your puzzle solving and combat abilities!


Also you acquire  upgrades through the game like the classic double jump.



And other special and unique abilities!

                                                       
THE FORMS

                                                            
As Circle Flatman you'll be very light, meaning your jumps will reach higher places and you can float on water. The circle could be considered the ""middle ground"" of the three shapes, as it has medium walking speed. With this one you'll be able to defeat the heavy square type enemies, but you'll have to be careful with the triangle ones, they're very sharp, ouch!

                                                            

Triangle Flatman is the speedster. He can run faster than the other two, but you'll have less control over your movement, so watch your step! You'll cover great distances with this form, so take advantage of its speed. As triangle you'll have the power to beat the balloon like circle enemies, but you can be defeated with ease by the strong square type enemies, they're a though bunch!

                                                             
Last but not least, is Square Flatman. This shape is the slowest and heaviest, but also the strongest and sturdiest. He can sink underwater like a rock, and his might is pretty formidable. He's able to push heavy objects and cause great harm. The Square can crush the feeble triangle types, but look out for those circle types, they can make you loose your balance!
By combining the three shapes, you can explore the whole Flat Kingdom and discover all kinds of secrets. After each level you'll acquire different upgrades for new skills! Use them wisely!
The worlds are big and full of secrets and surprises! So you'll have plenty to do and discover while you reach your goal.
                                                       





















Our stretch goals include to have awesome full motion videos by Don Porfirio, a game theme composed by Manami Matsumae (you may know her from Mighty Number 9 or Megaman), multiplayer mode and ports to game consoles.











                                                          



The game is still in development. We recently cooked up a demo version and displayed it live in different video game events in our city, where the participants gave us their feedback to improve our game.

Now we are finishing up the first level (The Flat Forest) and polishing a few details to begin the new areas of the game.


We have a long way ahead of us, we know, but we're on the right track and all we need is a little help from you to make this project a reality!
                                                       
    
OUR TEAM



We are Fat Panda Games, a small and young game studio located in the beautiful state of Yucatán, in México.
The team has all kinds of crazy characters, ranging from our creative director to programmers, concept artists, designers, animators, 3D artists, illustrators and musicians.


If you wanna learn more about us, you can check out our official site.
                                                     

SOUNDTRACK
The soundtrack is made by the audio engineer Rodrigo Buenfil, in his studio Stereolab. Here are some of the tracks of the game







                                                        
PRESS AND MEDIA

                                                          RISKS AND CHALLENGES


Being our first big project as a team, we are facing a lot of new challenges that we must learn to overcome. We are using our skills in animation, illustration, programming and design in this 1 year and a half project.
To be  honest, the videogame industry is not really that serious (not to say non existent) in this little corner of the world (Mérida, Yucatán), so it's though to get local support and investment. This is mainly why we are here, because we want to encourage more indie video game startups in Latin America and in all parts of the world.
We love what we do and we love videogames. We are having fun developing this, so we hope you'll have fun playing it. Our motto is ""develop the games we would like to play ourselves"".
                                                            

FAQ

How many stages are in the game?
So far, there are 6 levels in the work (each one being pretty big and full of secrets, with at least two bosses). But some of our stretch goals include an extra chapter and a whole new level!

<p>Starting from the moment we post this on Indiegogo we will be doing our best to line up sponsors that are willing to participate in <strong>our groundbreaking mobile advertising platform</strong> by providing cash awards for the winners of the gamerounds. We've already put some feelers out and crunched the numbers for a few potential major sponsors and the interest is high as our new system is the first of its kind and is absolutely the best way under the sun to reach mobile device users!</p>
<p><strong>This is where YOU come in - if the United Kingdom's community of mobile device users unite in flexing their mobile muscles, the advertisers will listen much sooner than later. </strong></p>
<p>You can weigh in now by simply <strong>pre-registering</strong> to play right now and also have all of your friends and family do the same. <a href=""http://mobilewisdomgames.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It's free to play and it takes less than one minute to register</a>.<br/><br/><a href=""http://mobilewisdomgames.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://mobilewisdomgames.com/images/mainthumbs_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h2><strong>How to Play</strong></h2>
<p>An MWG gameround will be broadcast live 12 times a day on the Internet to start and you play from your mobile device by texting the correct answers (a seven digit number) at the end of each gameround. You must get 7 out of 7 answers correct and be among the first 10 to win (10 winners each round). While MWG does not charge anything or make anything from the texting, and it is free to play the game, your carrier may charge you for texting. Many smartphone users can also see the MWG gamerounds live right from their mobile device!</p>
<p><span>The UK launch goal includes the creation of 2,500 new multimedia SmartDarts and a 30 day supply of multimedia MWG gamerounds for the UK. <strong>Our proprietary system processes the answers to each gameround publically and in real time (instant gratification) and then ranks the answers for accuracy and time stamp.</strong> You will be challenged in a unique and entertaining way while having fun and spreading wisdom at the same time right from your mobile device because our ""game pieces"" are multimedia messages that you may share right from your mobile device. Although the gameround schedule will be public, the raw data, rankings and other information are only available to registered users. </span><a href=""http://mobilewisdomgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Register today and ask your family and friends to do the same!</a></p>
<p>If we are unable to find sponsors by the launch date, we will still broadcast the MWG gamerounds, rank the winners and basically you will be playing for fun and braggng rights. We will do this for as long as we're able to without sponsors.</p>
<p>If we are short of our goal here on Indiegogo we will create the multimedia content accordingly which will have a bearing on how many gamerounds we can broadcast daily.</p>
<p><strong>Either way, all perks will be fulfilled!</strong> </p>
<h2><strong>About SmartDarts</strong></h2>
<p>Smartdarts are multimedia packets of human knowledge (as opposed to alien knowledge which may follow later). What if someone dedicated the time and energy to find, catalog and convert the facts of life everywhere into short videos that included <strong>over 5,000 awesome licensed music tracks of many genres</strong>, awesome animations and graphics and they made it so these multimedia packets of knowledge could be easily shared via mobile devices anywhere in the world?</p>
<p><strong>This is what MWG is doing right now.</strong> Actually, we have been doing this under the radar for years and now that we have nailed the smartdart processes, we need your help to replicate production for the gradual country by country, project by project launch. Backers will be helping us produce this multimedia content in time for the launch. MWG gamerounds &amp; resultsrounds also consist of SmartDarts and even more multimedia!</p>

<h2><strong>We Innovate for the Community</strong></h2>
<p><strong>MWG has an eye on the future. </strong>We make games that are not only fun, but also <strong>productive in the real world.</strong> These are games that will offer all folks an equal opportunity to be included within the economic loop whenever possible throughout each day!</p>
<p><strong><strong>Consider this:</strong><span> </span></strong>what if a part of the zillions of dollars spent on ad campaigns and media spots to get the public's attention were instead re-directed to providing rewards and incentives directly to the public via MWG gamerounds in an attempt to get the public's attention?<strong><span>  </span></strong><strong><strong>People deserve this opportunity to change the game!<br/></strong></strong></p>

<h2>About MWG GameRounds</h2>
<p>Initially we will broadcast MWG gamerounds 12 times a day and each MWG gameround is preceded by the results of the previous round for a total of 6 minutes. As the game gains popularity, we are able to increase the frequency of broadcasts as needed. As the game increases in popularity, the goal is to have all kinds of businesses take notice of the advertising opportunities and begin to vigorously participate via more &amp; more sponsorship of MWG gamerounds. Remember, the sponsors will be the ones deciding and providing the awards and also the terms that go with each MWG gameround. <strong>Our proprietary program aptly facilitates these transactions and we're also the producers of the content.</strong> If we do not find sponsors to furnish the cash awards by 1 December 2012, the UK games will still begin, but without the cash awards. R<strong>egister today. It's free!</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is the community that has the REAL POWER in the marketplace to make these improvements actually happen. A successful launch will show other businesses that this will absolutely be a win win situation.  <br/><a href=""http://mobilewisdomgames.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Register today and ask your family and friends to do the same!<strong><br/></strong></a></strong></p>

<h2>About Sponsors</h2>
<p>Advertising makes the world go around. But things are changing very quickly these days because we're all getting a lot smarter about the way we do things. We don't believe that old shotgun blast method of advertising is going to work for mobile users of the world. Even the industry admits that a lot of that advertising is not effective yet, and no one has really figured mobile out - that is until you just did.....</p>
<ul>
<li>The smarter community today knows that people of the world have a much stronger voice than ever thanks to advances in technology.</li>
<li>The smarter community knows that there are better ways to get stuff done now.</li>
<li>The smarter community knows that if businesses need the community, then the community can motivate businesses to help find better ways to circulate dollars within the community beyond charity.</li>
<li>
<strong>The smarter sponsors and advertisers</strong> will now know that the smarter community is very aware of their new found powers and that smarter advertiser will now make the necessary adjustments to effectively reach the smarter community.</li>
</ul><p>The smarter community knows that when this game launches successfully, this game will be known as <strong>the world's greatest game ever!</strong></p>
<h2>About Free Registration</h2>
<p>Our goal is <strong>1 million United Kingdom registrations</strong> before 1 December 2012! Your backing is greatly appreciated but another very important ingredient needed for a successful launch is for everyone to register to play! It takes less than one minute to register and we will never sell or distribute this information without your permission. Your registration is the prime reason sponsors will want to provide the rewards for the games. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word and also register today. This is what will draw in the sponsors. <a href=""http://mobilewisdomgames.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It's easy &amp; it is free!</a></p>
<h2>More Power to the People</h2>
<p>As you've probably already noticed by now, this is way beyond a game - <strong>this is a new system</strong> that enables businesses to get their messages to the people in a mutually productive way. Think about the previously dominant advertising models that made businesses go to advertising agencies and conventional media companies to get their messages to consumers. While that model has been highly successful, thanks to mobile technology, there are new and better ways to get messages to consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Consider this:</strong> what if a part of the zillions of dollars spent on ad campaigns and media spots to get the people's attention were instead re-directed to providing cash awards directly to the people via MWG gamerounds in an attempt to get the people's attention? <strong>People deserve this opportunity to change the game!  </strong>(yes, we had to say it twice)</p>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>Right out the gate, Mobile Wisdom Games LLC announced and published the fact that a minimum 50% of MWG’s net profits will always go back to the communities supporting the new MWG model via MWG sponsored gamerounds. <a href=""http://www.prlog.org/11885205-mwg-worlds-greatest-game-ever-pledges-50-minimum-of-profits-back-to-the-people-via-gamerounds.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">See the press release here.</a></p>
<p>Also, built into our system is the ability for registered users to see clearly how well other businesses are supporting the communities that support them. Needless to say, (but we're saying it anyway), <strong>this can be a very powerful tool for the people of the world!</strong></p>

</div></div>","What We're AboutOur aim is to start a facility called ""The Proving Grounds"". This facility will be tailor-made for people who want to train in martial arts, and will also be home to the one and only Melee Combat Games.The Proving GroundsThe Proving Grounds is a concept that we've had in our heads for years—a facility for martial artists where they can come and train at their convenience, where the house has the gear they need, no matter the style. We want to build a hub for martial arts enthusiasts of all stripes.The facility will be split into two sections. The first will be the drop-in and training area. This area is going to have plenty of open space for movement, mats, punching bags, and more!Our goal for the training side of the building is to allow for two things:1) A safe and well-equipped environment for drop-in training.2) A space for instructors to run their own martial arts classes.We'd like Proving Grounds to host teachers of various styles and to help promote all forms of martial arts. This will give people access to far more resources in one place than they're likely to find anywhere else.We already have 1 regular class signed up to be run out of our facility, and we foresee many more joining soon!*Update*Thanks to the campaign getting out there, we've been contacted and have 2 more regular classes being discussed for the facility!Melee Combat Games The other section in the facility will be for Melee Combat Games. Melee Combat Games is close to what you'd get if you took the guns out of paintball and replaced them with swords. We play classic games such as capture the flag and team deathmatch but rather than using C02 powered guns, we're using swords and shields, spears, bows and arrows, and a large variety of other slashy, stabby and smashy melee weapons.The HistoryMelee Combat Games started on Vancouver Island in February of 2014. The concept came out of an airsoft game that turned into a sword fight and quickly became its own entity. Many of our members have come from a martial arts background and enjoy the chance to test out what they've learned in their schools.The Weapons All the weapons we use are specially made by a company out of Quebec called Calimacil, which is the worlds top manufacturer of replica padded weapons. Starting in 2004, they quickly rose to become a world renowned name in Live Action Role Playing, and historical re-enactment.They make their weapons by wrapping a fiberglass or carbon core with Kevlar, and then pressing the materiel with a tear, puncture and weather resistant, high impact foam. 

 The durability of our weaponsThe weapons have been thoroughly stress tested, and have proven time and time again to be of the highest quality we could ask for.

Functions include power, game switching, and mode selection. GYRO DETECT - Only on Smart E-Cube Full VersionThe 9-Axis Motion Sensor enables the prompting of the next move to ultimately lead to a solved puzzle, as well as allows to play motion sensing games.HOME MAGNETIC - Only on Smart E-Cube Full VersionAlthough the Smart E-Cube LOOKS different from the traditional Rubik's Cube, it FEELS the same. The Smart E-Cube Full Version has a Home Magnet integration to each 90-degree position, providing the “snap” feeling you get with a traditional Rubik's Cube. Knowing when you’ve made a complete move is essential when learning how to quickly solve the puzzle.As the name suggests, the Smart “Electronic” Cube incorporates high-quality electronic technology, elevating the traditional Rubik's Cube game into something more. Multiple electronic chips, circuits, various sensors, and batteries are all embedded in the 63 × 63 × 63cm cube space. Smart E-Cube uses a total of 122 structural components and nearly 1000 electronic modules.BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY - Connect to any smart phone through the integrated Bluetooth system.POWER SUPPLY - USB and wireless charging technology is included on the Smart E-Cube. It takes about one hour for a full charge, and battery life lasts about 2 to 3 months when on standby mode! However, Smart E-Cube can still work as a traditional Rubik's Cube without any battery. The fun doesn’t stop when you run out of power! SMART E-CUBE TIMELINEThank you for checking out our Smart E-Cube Indiegogo Campaign! Make sure to follow Smart E-Cube on Facebook.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>      Let me tell you a little about myself, and this project. I'm Dave Vogt; I run operations at <a href=""www.gwwentertainment.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gaming World Wide</a>; a gaming group and website that focuses on charity, information, and entertainment. Beyond that, I hold several gaming world records, and have dabbled in independent game design for years. So, I'm bringing it all together. This title, The Bounty, is a unique, retro styled, high score based RPG. A roguelike with a classic arcade edge. It's meant to challenge the player, and inspire them to push their limits further. You start your game, and delve into the dungeon; everything you do rewards you with points. But there are no shops, no inns, no safehouses. Once you die, you die. You're awarded your score, and return to the title screen. Next time you might do better. Of course, you might end up in different levels this time.  Above all that? The game is being released for free. Featuring custom sprite work by Mike ""NESQuester"" Wright, we have the highest expectations of this game to bring you back to the old days, in a new way.</p>
<p>     Care to try it now? I've assembled a pre-alpha demo. This is proof of concept only; just enough to get the object of the game across, using all stock middleware RTP assets. <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/h6qzy85nwupwjcp/The%20Bounty%20Demov03.exe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can find and download this demo here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, how much are we looking for? The lower end is $2500. This will cover a bare minimum of development costs such as hardware, software, and staff. Going up to a more desirable $4000 and beyond will get us custom chiptune music, more artwork, and more specialized hardware. Basically, a more awesome final product, and a framework to deliver new level packs and sequels in the future. </p>
<p>  The perks really involve you in the development. Your contributions will have you designing levels in the dungeons, helping create items, and even becoming a playable character! I'll personally work with you to ensure maximum balancing and playability, so it's a fun and easy way to make a real creative contribution; a personal touch beyond a standard financial funding-for a perk. If you prefer promotional items, those are options as well, of course.</p>
<p>UPDATED: A little something else to say thank you to our backers; included in every perk is not only a timed early release of The Bounty, but also an exclusive level pack. This collection of fun special levels will be only released to indiegogo backers; though you can share if you want to. ;)</p>
<p>    We're aiming for a release date of December 1st, 2013. This could be delayed; whether there is a huge influx of fan created content, technical issues, or if additional debugging/QA testing is required. December 1st is the goal however, and video diaries will be recorded frequently, keeping you up to date on the progress.</p>
<p>     What if we don't reach our goal? A basic version of the game will be built. The art/music assets will be weaker, QA/bug testing will be limited; but there will be a well playing, quality game to be found!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As AAA games get bigger and bigger, players are turning to independent games for those classic experiences the big studios don't bother with anymore. The Bounty is the real deal, with every detail painstakingly built and fine tuned by a world class competitor. To be able to present this experience to the world, free of charge... is beyond explanation. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, there's still plenty you can do to help make this a reality! Beyond indiegogo's sharing tools, you can hype up this project, pass it around to the people you know. Anything you can do is most appreciated.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hello!

<h3><span style=""background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.15;"">There's Gabby, the plucky little reporter. Sporting a flying machine, a Smith and Wesson revolver, her trusty notebook and her signature ""don't get fresh with me bucko!"" attitude, this is one classy lassy. Having achieved worldwide fame during her first assignment as a reporter for the Jasper Gazette by inadvertently ending the greatest war the world had ever seen, Gabby was immediately ""promoted"" to spokeswoman of the paper. Unfortunately for her, this promotion means that she's doomed to public appearances and covering softball stories for the rest of her days. But when the demon invasion begins, she quickly finds herself caught right in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime scoop for a second time! But will this time be the chance she needs to prove she belongs with her feet on the street walking the beat? Only time will tell, Gabby! Only time will tell!</span></h3>

<h3><br/></h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","This Just In! is a bullethell shooter/RPG hybrid stuffed with humor, action and adventure, and set in an alternate 1920s America full of flappers, packed with plucky reporters and plagued by the prohibition of alcohol. Take control of three high-flying gals as they battle their own personal demons as well as a literal invasion of demons from the underworld. ""Fight the demons without and within. Then your adventure shall truly begin"" or so they say! Who says that? Not sure. But one thing is for sure, and that is that these girls have spunk! Spunk in spades!









                                    
There's Gabby, the plucky little reporter. Sporting a flying machine, a Smith and Wesson revolver, her trusty notebook and her signature ""don't get fresh with me bucko!"" attitude, this is one classy lassy. Having achieved worldwide fame during her first assignment as a reporter for the Jasper Gazette by inadvertently ending the greatest war the world had ever seen, Gabby was immediately ""promoted"" to spokeswoman of the paper. Unfortunately for her, this promotion means that she's doomed to public appearances and covering softball stories for the rest of her days. But when the demon invasion begins, she quickly finds herself caught right in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime scoop for a second time! But will this time be the chance she needs to prove she belongs with her feet on the street walking the beat? Only time will tell, Gabby! Only time will tell!







                                      





Next up is ALICE. Definitely the most successful of the eccentric Dr. Felix’s inventions, ALICE is a walking, talking bonafide marvel of modern science. While she looks like something straight out of a Zip Johnson serial, make no mistake, she is no work of fiction! She is as real as you or I! Built with the power of flight and a whole slew of electrical mishaps that could be repurposed as weapons, she doesn’t sneeze at danger. And when her creator’s latest invention results in the accidental release of demons into the world, ALICE makes it her personal mission to stop the invading hordes and restore Dr. Felix’s honor. But what good could one mechanical girl do against the seemingly endless armies of the underworld? What good indeed?



                

                                      
        
Finally, there is Hilda. Gifted with the power of flight from birth thanks to her beautiful demonic wings... Wait... demonic? You read that right? Hilda is herself a demon princess. What is a demon princess doing fighting against her own kind? You must play the game to find out! OR, you can simply read on while I tell you! Hilda is the daughter of Lord von Wormheart, a man whose sometimes cruel treatment of his subjects rubs Hilda the wrong way. And even though he shows nothing but complete affection for her, she resents a ruler who would show favoritism to his family while throwing those who depend on his rule under the bus. But when his latest tirade has him marching an army against one of his own villages, she decides that is a line she will not let him cross, and so sets out to stop him.




                      

The core gameplay of This Just In! is bullethell horizontal shooting action, but with a twist. First of all, the three playable characters will have unique characteristics, governing their power, movement speed and other things. But these characters will be fully customizable with different equipment, costumes, and customizable skill trees.

 





Finding the game too difficult? Turn the difficulty slider down, or replay old levels to grind for experience. Or maybe it's too easy? Turn the difficulty slider up and enjoy more difficult bullet patterns, but also a better chance at finding more powerful, valuable loot. 



The choices are completely up to you. We want the game to reflect your personal playstyle and preferences as much as possible.

 
Or maybe you're the type of person who would like to compete for a high score in a completely controlled campaign free of RPG mechanics? Play through the arcade mode, a seperate experience with a simplified version of the story based on more traditional shooters, complete with high scores and continue credits.
 



But back to the main campaign mode. Each character will have her own side-scrolling hub town to explore in between levels. It is in this hub town that you will talk to NPCs, buy items to use on levels, buy and customize equipment and change skills.



And there are many more exciting details we will give in future updates, so please stay tuned!





                                                      
 
No Grapes Games is a group of three guys, and we all have day jobs. But making a game takes time, and making a quality game takes even more time. Which means that in order to make This Just In! the best game it can possibly be, and in a timely manner, we are going to have to take time off of our day jobs to make it happen. 

We hate DRM as much as the next people, and as a result, This Just In! will proudly be DRM free for Linux, Windows and Android platforms.

 
If this is the kind of game you would like to play, or if you know someone who would be interested in playing it, please spread the word! Your support is greatly appreciated!
 
                         Who are we?
We are No Grapes Games, a new three-man game development team formed with the express purpose of making This Just In! We're all friends who grew up playing horizontal and vertical shooters, role-playing games and adventure games. With great passion for these genres, we decided it would be fun and worthwhile to combine our favorite aspects of these experiences into what we are calling This Just In!

Join thousands of people from all over the world. Compare your scores to others. Track statistics of most popular languages and games, the hardest and easiest words and check were the players are coming from.
What we want to do now is to ADD MORE LANGUAGES! That's why we need your help.
You can choose from four basic game modes plus two extra ones.
First one will check your basic word recognition.


Second is for testing reading skills:


Third is concentrating on your hearing and it's very similar to the first one but instead showing you the written word it gives you the ability to repeat the audio:


Fourth will test your spelling. This is the hardest one especially in languages that use non-Latin writing system like Greek, Japanese or Russian. Guessing is almost impossible. You just have to know the answer and for correct one you will get six points.


The fifth game is a shuffle mode that will randomly choose one of the four basic modes. This one is both the hardest and most enjoyable.
The last game is a little different and is for learning hiragana and katakana – a basic component of the Japanese writing system:


 
Currently you can learn words in 11 languages plus a shuffle mode that will throw at you random language after every given answer (in game just click the rainbow icon to try it yourself).
Also the interface is available in almost all of those languages except Japanese.
All of the illustrations are hand drawn on paper. We had to literally draw almost 4000 images just to select the right ones which were skaned and vectorised so they can be used as SVG files and look equally good on big and small screens and on screen with high pixel density like Retina Display on iPhones or iPads.


For most of our books we usually design dedicated typefaces. Very often we precisely know what we need. This means that if we can’t find any existing font that fits our specific idea, we have to create it.
For Ba Ba Dum we needed a narrow, sans serif, rounded and heavy letters with a very wide range of languages to support.
As usually we started with simple and fast sketches. Then we drew more precise shapes using font editor software. We did some sample prints, marked things that had to be changed, and went back to the editor.

As you can see below we have a short list of upcoming languages. Some of them we'll be added sooner some later. But if you're a really big fan of any particular goal from that list you can become an exclusive sponsor on the whole language. You have to select one of the perks from the $900 Supporter group and voilà! Your favorite language will be added.

<p>Bota Abaixo* is an
original and independent project born at the hands of four friends who share a
love for illustration… and for drinking!</p>
<p>Thus they set on a
quest to find the cure for boredom an  a way out of awkward silences on
stuck-up events. And there it was, a way of turning the most monotonous of
parties into a cascade of good vibe: creating a custom-made drinking game!</p>
<p>With this intent and
pencils in hand they got down to work, and inspired by the most popular
drinking games such as “Ring of Fire” and “Kings”, they adapted these games
transforming them into a funny unique game, easier to play and fully illustrated:

This is our team and
their essential information:
Bruno Rajão – if he was one of the Seven Dwarfs he would be Grumpy, always hated school but as a teacher he has no other choice. It’s a divine punishment for grumbling all the time. 
Patrícia Figueiredo –
the star of the team, sacred international champion of hiccups.
Daniel Souto – he believes to be an alien adopted at birth by earthlings, unable to face the truth of being a mere earthling adopted by aliens.
Eduardo Porto – As a
child he used to watch cartoons and ride a bicycle. Nowadays he rides a
motorcycle to impress the ladies… and watches cartoons

















Bota Abaixo is
composed of 56 cards, each with its unique illustration. Divided in 4 suits –
each from a different author, the game combines 14 rules into a near infinite
amount of combinations of creativity, conviviality and all-round silliness. 
Plus, the cards are
larger than in a conventional deck. Think big right?
To make life easier
for players, the rules are displayed on the custom-made cards in a size
guaranteeing intelligible reading (may not apply in later rounds).

  





Piece

<h3>D20 Maps for Minis made easy!</h3>
I have been a tabletop gamer for the past fourteen years, often taking the roll of the dungeon master or story teller. As much as I enjoy getting to run campaigns there is always someone who gets lost or somehow manages to be at the perfect place to survive or attack no matter where they were previously.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With the innovation of roll up maps and minis things got a bit easier but it always took a while to setup rooms and if you didnt want the players to know ahead of time you could only setup the room once a player entered it, taking time away from the game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With the modular map you will be able to setup your dungeon/map before you get to the game and bring rooms out only when you need them. Allowing for quicker transitions and less downtime for the players!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each tile floor and most walls are a little bigger than 1x1"", Half walls and single doors are 1x1/2"" Each box will have an average ratio of 1:10 doors to floor pieces and 1:2.5 walls to floor. This will give an even distribution and make sure that you dont run out of vital pieces at the wrong time.</div>

<h3>What we need to make this a reality!</h3>
<p>The funding level for this project is $10,000 and for that we will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a 3D printer to make all the pieces for the modular system. Currently the 3D printer is going to be the Solidoodle 3D, 3rd Generation.</li>
<li>Plastic Filament: this is the material that the pieces will be printed out of.</li>
<li>Pay for nessicary creative work for the designs of the pieces.</li>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Dungeons!</strong></p>
<p>I bet you have been wondering what you get if you contribute! Well here it is. You get to be part of the dungeon! Currently perks above Floor Tile are only available in the continental US. I will be working to sort out what the costs will be to ship outside the US and I will update the project with that information soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Floor Tile $15:</strong> You are one of the floor tiles. Often overlooked but never forgotten. You are the foundation of the dungeon and without you there would be no dungeon. At this level you will have our sincerest appreciation and your name will be printed in the instructions under Floor Tiles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wall Tile $30:</strong> You hold up the dungeon. You keep the ceiling from falling in and give adventurers direction. This level gives you a copy of the small box. The small box comes with 90 pieces, enough to make one large dungeon room, one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Wall Tiles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Door Tile $65:</strong> The door is the gateway to adventure. Without the doors you would not be able to enter the dungeon. At this level you will get a medium box. At 220 pieces you will have enough to make two rooms and a hallway with plenty of spares and one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Door Tiles</li>
<li>
<strong>Dungeon Crawler $100:</strong> You are the adventurer! You run through and view the majesty that is created and slaughter the monsters. Without you, the world would be a very boring place. At this level you will get the 400 piece Dungeon Crawler Box! Four rooms and three hallways worth of tiles. Enough to make a small dungeon, one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Dungeon Crawlers, and one adventure from the Dungeon Makers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dungeon Master $500:</strong> You are the ruler of all you survey. Worlds are created and extinguished at your whim. Without you there would be no dungeon and there would be no heroes. You are truely the soul of the game. This level will provide you with all the necessary parts to make a moderate to large dungeon, one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Dungeon Masters, and one copy of each of the Dungeon Maker adventures</li>
<li>
<strong>Dungeon Maker $1000:</strong> Congratulations! You are immortalized in the game world. You will get to design an adventure that will be included with the game. Our team will be available to work with you to create your adventure. Besides designing an adventure you will also receive a Dungeon Master Box of tiles and your name will be printed inside the front cover of the instructions as a Dungeon Maker as well as on the cover of your adventure.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we dont make it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we manage to make it over $1000 all funding will go to fulfilling the donations that were made. </li>
<li>If less than $1000 is made the funding will be placed into a savings account while prototyping continues. Once a better prototype is available this project will be re-submitted for funding.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>$15,000: Entry Way! We will design special Dungeon tiles for the entrance to your adventure. New doors will be created so you can start the adventure before you enter the dungeon. Tiles will be added to Wall and above levels</li>
<li>$25,000: Bases! At this level we will work on creating bases for youe tiles, something that will allow you to snap all your tiles into place. Bases will be four 12x12"" panels, along with a cross section support that will prevent collapse and edging. This will provide a stand for your dungeon and give your dungeon more support. Bases will be added to Dungeon Crawler level and above.</li>
<li>$35,000: The Sky is no longer the limit! Ceiling Tiles, We will create tiles to give your dungeon a ceiling. Like having a surprise? Keep your dungeon rooms a secret by covering your rooms with ceiling tiles. As your adventurers enter the room unveil the mystery that stands before them. This will also allow you to store the minatures for your encounters in the rooms. No more forcasting the fight to come by pulling out the monsters!</li>
<li>Everything over $35,000 will go to future projects: Modern Tile sets, and Future tile sets. All tile sets will be inter connectable.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Change the landscape of gaming.</h3>
This project will open the door to making cheap and effective mapping tools for Game Masters, strategiests, and hobbiests. Funding of this project will allow for infinitly expandable game boards. A dungeon that is only limited by the size of your table/floor/workshop.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While the project goes on we will work on making varying textures for tiles so that you will have a bigger variety of pieces to play with. Beyond regular tiles we are looking at developing pilars, wells, treasure and special trap spaces.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Map made with 3D pieces"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/747912/pictures/full/20130409115711-Base_dungeon_map.png?1365533835"" src="""" style="""" title=""Dungeon 1""/></div>

The Dungeons!
I bet you have been wondering what you get if you contribute! Well here it is. You get to be part of the dungeon! Currently perks above Floor Tile are only available in the continental US. I will be working to sort out what the costs will be to ship outside the US and I will update the project with that information soon.
 


Floor Tile $15: You are one of the floor tiles. Often overlooked but never forgotten. You are the foundation of the dungeon and without you there would be no dungeon. At this level you will have our sincerest appreciation and your name will be printed in the instructions under Floor Tiles.

Wall Tile $30: You hold up the dungeon. You keep the ceiling from falling in and give adventurers direction. This level gives you a copy of the small box. The small box comes with 90 pieces, enough to make one large dungeon room, one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Wall Tiles.

Door Tile $65: The door is the gateway to adventure. Without the doors you would not be able to enter the dungeon. At this level you will get a medium box. At 220 pieces you will have enough to make two rooms and a hallway with plenty of spares and one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Door Tiles

Dungeon Crawler $100: You are the adventurer! You run through and view the majesty that is created and slaughter the monsters. Without you, the world would be a very boring place. At this level you will get the 400 piece Dungeon Crawler Box! Four rooms and three hallways worth of tiles. Enough to make a small dungeon, one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Dungeon Crawlers, and one adventure from the Dungeon Makers.

Dungeon Master $500: You are the ruler of all you survey. Worlds are created and extinguished at your whim. Without you there would be no dungeon and there would be no heroes. You are truely the soul of the game. This level will provide you with all the necessary parts to make a moderate to large dungeon, one set of instructions which will have your name printed under Dungeon Masters, and one copy of each of the Dungeon Maker adventures

Dungeon Maker $1000: Congratulations! You are immortalized in the game world. You will get to design an adventure that will be included with the game. Our team will be available to work with you to create your adventure. Besides designing an adventure you will also receive a Dungeon Master Box of tiles and your name will be printed inside the front cover of the instructions as a Dungeon Maker as well as on the cover of your adventure.

 
If we dont make it:

If we manage to make it over $1000 all funding will go to fulfilling the donations that were made. 
If less than $1000 is made the funding will be placed into a savings account while prototyping continues. Once a better prototype is available this project will be re-submitted for funding.

 
Stretch Goals:

$15,000: Entry Way! We will design special Dungeon tiles for the entrance to your adventure. New doors will be created so you can start the adventure before you enter the dungeon. Tiles will be added to Wall and above levels
$25,000: Bases! At this level we will work on creating bases for youe tiles, something that will allow you to snap all your tiles into place. Bases will be four 12x12"" panels, along with a cross section support that will prevent collapse and edging. This will provide a stand for your dungeon and give your dungeon more support. Bases will be added to Dungeon Crawler level and above.
$35,000: The Sky is no longer the limit! Ceiling Tiles, We will create tiles to give your dungeon a ceiling. Like having a surprise? Keep your dungeon rooms a secret by covering your rooms with ceiling tiles. As your adventurers enter the room unveil the mystery that stands before them. This will also allow you to store the minatures for your encounters in the rooms. No more forcasting the fight to come by pulling out the monsters!
Everything over $35,000 will go to future projects: Modern Tile sets, and Future tile sets. All tile sets will be inter connectable.

 


Change the landscape of gaming.
This project will open the door to making cheap and effective mapping tools for Game Masters, strategiests, and hobbiests. Funding of this project will allow for infinitly expandable game boards. A dungeon that is only limited by the size of your table/floor/workshop.
 
While the project goes on we will work on making varying textures for tiles so that you will have a bigger variety of pieces to play with. Beyond regular tiles we are looking at developing pilars, wells, treasure and special trap spaces.

<p>Hello Indiegogo Family,</p>
<p>In July 2013 when 14 players walk out for the opening ceremony of the 19<sup>th</sup> Maccabiah games proudly wearing Canadian colors and marching behind the Canadian maple leaf flag, it will be for the first time in the history of the Maccabiah games that Canada would have sent a cricket team for the games. They will march along with 600 other Canadian athletes aspiring to make their country proud. There will be more than 8000 athletes from 65 countries competing for the honors.  </p>
<p>So what are the Maccabiah games? <strong><br/></strong>“They are the world’s third largest multinational sports games. Only the Olympics and Pan Am games stand ahead.”<strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p>What we are doing. <strong><br/></strong>“We have been practicing for months now, to improve our game and our fitness level so we can represent Canada as a great team. Our coach, Emmanuel Joseph has been trying for years to get Maccabiah to allow a Canadian cricket team. This year they finally said yes.” Coach Joseph said, “This is a unique opportunity for us to represent Canada at the Maccabiah Games. Although we have a long road ahead, and some intense commitment, dedication and perseverance to demonstrate, we have, for the first time, a chance to further promote a sport that has now started to grow and mature in Canada. I have complete confidence that we will put up a tremendous effort and surprise the cricket world that Canada is ready to take on any challenge that comes our way at the Maccabiah”.<br/><strong><br/><br/></strong>Why we need the money.<strong><br/></strong>""Unfortunately it is not cheap to attend these games. Between accommodation, food, entrance fees, flights, practice sessions and equipment we need to raise more than $9,000 per player. We have already raised $50,000 and plan to raise another $100,000 out of our other fundraising campaigns, which is why we are asking for $50,000.<strong><br/></strong>What you get for funding. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>We thought that it would be cool if we documented this whole process. We will film everything, from our practices, the flight there, walking into the stadium representing Canada with over 50,000 viewers, our games, all the way to the flight home. We would share this with you though our social media channels. If we raise enough money, we would create a short film about our trip and send a digital copy to you, our funders.<strong><br/></strong>We are offering many other rewards for funders, from t-shirts to signed cricket balls and posters of the team. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>We want to make this happen, not only for ourselves but for Canada, so please if you can’t help fund us, share this with your friends or family and help us present the Canadian Cricket to the world."" Any amount will get the team get closer to our goal; your generosity is greatly appreciated.</p>

Ray Easterling, a safety for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1970s and a plaintiff in a high-profile lawsuit against the N.F.L. over its handling of concussion-related injuries, died on April 19 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!  We want to shoot this documentary, ""A Head Of The Game"", to educate America on the dangers of concussions via the NFL athletes that suffer from them every day.  We will hear from expert neurolgist's like Dr. Daniel Amen who is doing the largest study on CTE, and chronic brain disorders in NFL athletes. We also plan to donate a significant amount of money for research for ongoing studies that relate to all athletes and chronic brain injuries. This is a serious issue and I intend to showcase the severe issues past NFL players are having from chronic brain injuries.  Again, will be donating a portion of the funds collected to Dr. Daniel Amen's research project with NFL athletes and chronic concussions. </p>

<p><strong>The Sports Girls LLC</strong> is a new company designed to educate america on football via the athletes, coaches, and trainers that do it on a daily basis.  Our goal is to spend time with athletes, on and off the field and educate America on the game itself, the good, bad, and the ugly.  We decided to take a chance.  We are a young company that is trying to do the right thing.  The NFL is not helping some of these retired athletes like Brent Boyd, Rayfield Wright, and many more that you will hear from in this documentary.   These men are suffering on a daily basis.  They are not getting million dollar checks, nor did they ever!  Some NFL retired athletes cannot even get medical coverage from the NFL, and we are taLking about NFL LEGENDS!  This is an incredible story that can only be told by the players that have lived it.  It will open up the eyes of many Americans, and we cannot let another athlete die.  There is help, and hope out there and we are going to show other athletes, moms, teachers, high school football players, dads, lawyers, children, college and even NFL athletes what really happened to these NFL players.  Concussions are a serious condition, and we are going to show you the medical proof!  We will even give Roger Goodell, and the NFL a chance to let America know what positive improvements and methodlogies are being put into place for current NFL athletes.  We will see if the NFL responds.  WE need your help.  Check out Dignity After Football on Face Book as Well.</p>

It's an action-adventure with RPG elements and an amazing story. We've been working on the game since November 2011 and it's almost done.
 


 Great story
 Dark atmospheric world
 Addictive and challenging gameplay
 Use of simple RPG elements (NPCs, character development)
 Unique hand-drawn artwork
 Multiplatform (iOS, Android, Mac, W8)
 

 

     First and foremost, we're players. We like to play games and we don't like the direction mainstream games are going in. We started ME2 Studio because we want to make games that we would like to play. Games that are missing in the current market. 


     The game will be released in the next few months regardless of the collected funds. Collected funds will help us to work on the game faster, get better results, and add extra elements such as additional language versions or voiceovers.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Now we want to create an equally stunning marketing campaign and we want <strong>you</strong> to be a part of it.<br/><br/>We want to create oodles of entertainment stuff for you and others to share so everyone can get to know about the game. As part of the team you will not only be able to contribute ideas, follow our progress as we develop cartoons, animation and other fun goodies, and be the first to get your hands on all of this, but we will also keep you updated on how well the marketing is doing.</p>
<p><br/>So, if you want to play a key part in a game’s success story then please read on …</p>

<h2>It starts with a horrifying story ...</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jumpingjupingo.com/images/indiegogo/AlienWithBaby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After messing up their moon’s climate a bunch of bug-eyed aliens come snooping around earth to abduct our baby spiders. The reason? They want the babies to work in their smelly factories to spin super strong silk for umbrellas. The umbrellas are for the hail stones that keep flattening the aliens. Disgusting, I know … about the babies.<br/> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jumpingjupingo.com/images/indiegogo/Jupingo_gameScreens.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the game you help Jupingo, a little jumping spider, to rescue the babies from the aliens. Your task is made all the more difficult by the locals – a bunch of harebrained bugs, each with its own particular nastiness. You guide Jupingo around the forests, caves and swamps by directing his jumps, and spin elastic silk threads to bounce him onto out-of-reach areas. All that while catching aliens and bugs as well as avoiding acid blobs, storming lunatics, paranoid screamers and some really nasty plants. You can see some more about the game from our website.

<p> </p>
<h2>Grin, grin, grin …</h2>
<p>OK, so we know you would have loved to help fund the game but the game is nothing without people knowing about it. You can still be part of what we hope will be a great success story. We are a small, independent game studio called WAKSTER and we have, over the past eight years, been developing lots and lots of games, characters and apps for our clients. We’ve worked on projects for companies such as Tropicana, Turner Broadcast, Ubisoft and Egmont Publishing. Like all highly creative teams we always wanted to create our own games so we started on Jumping Jupingo.</p>
<p>Jumping Jupingo and this marketing campaign is built on the team’s 25 years industry experience. It is a new phase for our company, moving from doing just client work to developing our own titles, and we hope you will be part of making this venture a success. </p>

<p><img align=""middle"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jumpingjupingo.com/images/indiegogo/jj_megaPhone.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We believe the fun and excitement of the game should be taken right into the marketing itself. Press releases and game reviews play an important part in promoting a game but the best marketing is done by <strong>YOU</strong> – it is YOU telling your friends about it. <br/><br/> Apart from the game we want to create loads of fun stuff for you to get excited about and share with your friends – <em>that’s you being a marketing expert</em>. The game has some great characters so we want to create animation, cartoons, posters and models for you to upload to your Facebook page, PInterest, Digg and wherever else you hang out.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Oh! The goodies!</h2>
<p>Here’s what we want to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 cartoon animations</strong></li>
<li><strong>20 cartoon strips</strong></li>
<li><strong>5 awesome posters</strong></li>
<li><strong>7 paper craft version of the game characters</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So get this: you will be the first to know and share this stuff and what’s more, we will be asking for your ideas and opinions as we develop them. Got a great idea for one of the animations or cartoons then share it with us and you’ll get credited – e.g. in the animation credits it might say: Original story concept: Jimmy Johnson.<br/><br/> Here is an example of the type of posters we will be creating but again, you will be able to share your ideas and who knows, you might get your idea developed.</p>

<br/><br/><strong>REWARDS, GIVE ME REWARDS!</strong>
</h2>
<p>Since we want you to help fund the marketing so we can give you loads of goodies to, well, help market the game by sharing all this wonderful stuff, we thought the rewards should be right in there with all the creativity, fun and shareable stuff. We want to give you something you won’t be able to get anywhere else and that is access to our creativity. Imagine this:</p>
<p>You as a paper craft character. Think of it: you can build hundreds of yourself and start a clone war in your bedroom.</p>
<p><img align=""middle"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jumpingjupingo.com/images/indiegogo/paperCraft_character.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What about a caricature poster of yourself as “The Bug Master” hanging in your office? You can have any title you want on the poster. Everyone will have a good chuckle when they see it and you can tell them how you helped make a fantastic game famous.</p>

<h2>OK, so give it to me short and sweet.</h2>
<p>So, in summary, this is an opportunity to play a key role in making Jumping Jupingo a success story by funding some awesome marketing material.  As part of this campaign you will have the opportunity to contribute to the creative process, you will be first in the queue to enjoy and share the animation, cartoons and posters with your friends and you can proudly say that you’ve helped create a success story. We will also keep you updated on how well the campaign is doing. If you help push us over our target amount we’ll just go on creating more and more fun stuff with the money available. If you’re happy and having fun then we’re happy and that’s the way to make it work.</p>

<h1>About FlexWorld</h1>
<div>FlexWorld (<i>Flexible World</i>) is a game about playing in dynamic and interesting worlds. It has been in development for about 10 months now.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I think the best way of describing FlexWorld is to talk about the 4 facts of the tagline: <i>""Play, Discover, Create, Develop""</i>
</div>
<h2>Play</h2>
<div>The first thing someone wants to do when getting a new game is - of course! - <i>playing it</i>. FlexWorld will come with a gamemode called <i>Factions:</i>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Your character joins the game as a young human in the wild. To survive you learn basic things like obtaining food, building a secure shelter and learning skills (mining, fishing, fighting, cooking etc.). You will also meet <i>Luna</i>, a friendly squirrel that answers your questions and gives you some basic tasks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As your character's abilities advance, you will begin to explore the world. Luna already told you about three factions that live somewhere. So you visit each of them and depending on your personal likings you do tasks for them. Unfortunately the three factions are at enmity, so when you do something for one faction, the other two won't be happy about it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>However being successful in one faction also means your ranking will increase and sooner or later your goal will be gaining as much power as possible. Of course that also counts for the other factions, so the stronger you get, the stronger the others will get.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Playing takes place at one planet in the beginning. If you're successful, your faction will be the only one left, but the universe doesn't only consist of one planet, and another nation that you even haven't thought of is also interested in getting back its land...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, does this sounds like an interesting singleplayer game? Wrong! FlexWorld is some kind of <i>hybrid:</i> It can <i>always</i> be turned into a multiplayer experience. Imagine you're just fighting for a faction and one of your friends comes online to support you - or defend his faction.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Technically FlexWorld does always run a server in the background. When starting a game (or loading a previous one), you can decide if others are allowed to join. Just make sure your computer is reachable from the internet.</div>
<h2>Discover</h2>
<div>FlexWorld doesn't force you to follow the <i>""storyline""</i>. You can always stop your tasks and explore the world. Maybe there's something you haven't discovered yet? Like special flowers or animals. Maybe some items can even be combined with others to create new stuff?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The <i>Factions</i> gamemode will already include a lot of things that can be discovered, but FlexWorld won't stop here; please read on!</div>
<h2>Create</h2>
<div>While playing <i>Factions</i>, I highly bet you will also create interesting things, like buildings, farms, cities etc. Especially when playing with friends it's something that's quite fun.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>However <i>Factions</i> isn't everything in FlexWorld, instead it's only <i>one</i> possible way of playing it. You can create complete new worlds, including planets, characters, items and even functionality.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So you just want a world where people can meet and chat? No problem, build it, remove all the <i>Factions</i> stuff and open the server for the public.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Want to bring it to an even higher level? Then you're probably a developer, and this is something where FlexWorld's biggest benefit kicks in:</div>
<h2>Develop</h2>
<div>As a developer (programmer, graphics artist, sound artist) you can use FlexWorld to create worlds completely from scratch.<i> </i>This includes graphics, sounds, music and scripts.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>FlexWorld uses the <i>Lua scripting language</i> to provide logics - in all aspects. So with some little effort you can create new gamemodes or modify <i>Factions</i>.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>FlexWorld has been designed to support custom assets from the beginning (as it is my personal goal: having a product that's not tied to one area). Let's do a little example: You always had that nice idea of a roleplay game. So you create a new world, create graphics and sounds (or use the ones from <i>Factions</i>) and provide the logics through Lua scripts. You feel it's fun and you decide it's quite more fun when others join your world. Just open your session for the public and your friends can enjoy <i>your world</i> together with you.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>You can also launch a 24/7 dedicated server. It's as simple as starting a new game on your local computer.</div>
<h3></h3>
<h1>Features</h1>
<div>Here's an incomplete list of features FlexWorld will include:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><ul>
<li>Built-in gamemode <i>Factions</i>.</li>
<li>OpenGL 3D graphics engine capable of modifying the whole world.</li>
<li>Designed to be extended: Add/change graphics, sounds, music and scripts.</li>
<li>Lua scripting language for creating own logics.</li>

<li>Multi-platform: Programmed in modern and standard C++ to ensure it runs at least on the <i>big three</i> (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).</li>
<li>Auto-update/-download of assets when joining other servers having assets that you don't have (via a resource hashing system).</li>
<li>No DRM, no restrictions: What you create is yours.</li>
</ul></div>
<h3></h3>
<h1>Status</h1>
<div>FlexWorld has been in development for more than 10 months. Core features like the client, server, much of the 3D engine, resource management, scripting and much more are already done and are currently in a refactoring process to harden the source code.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>However it's still too early to provide releases or demos. A lot of features are still being worked on. For example the <i>Factions</i> gamemode hasn't been started yet due to the development of the scripting engine and missing assets.</div>
<p></p>
<h1>What we need &amp; what you get</h1>
<div>We're programmers, that means we're really bad at the <i>creative things</i> like graphics, 3D models etc. These things need to be bought from professional artists.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also we'd like to program the project in full-time to fasten the development and being able to fully concentrate on it.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Of course there're tons of other things that need to be paid, like a website (+ server), legal stuff (trademark, taxes, sales, ...).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So every buck you invest into this project will greatly help its development in all areas. Keep in mind the campaign doesn't has to reach its goal. Every contribution helps!</div>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Besides the perks we'd also like to offer you a special feature: <i>Everyone who raises this campaign will get access to the (time-limited) pre-alpha release</i>. It will be the first release ever made for the public, and you'll be able to try it out - <i>for free!!</i>
</div>
<div><h1>Contributions for those with a small wallet</h1></div>
<div>We understand that a lot of people can't afford giving away money for something that hasn't even been completed. Therefore you can do other things if you like what we're doing.</div>

Playing takes place at one planet in the beginning. If you're successful, your faction will be the only one left, but the universe doesn't only consist of one planet, and another nation that you even haven't thought of is also interested in getting back its land...

So, does this sounds like an interesting singleplayer game? Wrong! FlexWorld is some kind of hybrid: It can always be turned into a multiplayer experience. Imagine you're just fighting for a faction and one of your friends comes online to support you - or defend his faction.

Technically FlexWorld does always run a server in the background. When starting a game (or loading a previous one), you can decide if others are allowed to join. Just make sure your computer is reachable from the internet.
Discover
FlexWorld doesn't force you to follow the ""storyline"". You can always stop your tasks and explore the world. Maybe there's something you haven't discovered yet? Like special flowers or animals. Maybe some items can even be combined with others to create new stuff?

The Factions gamemode will already include a lot of things that can be discovered, but FlexWorld won't stop here; please read on!
Create
While playing Factions, I highly bet you will also create interesting things, like buildings, farms, cities etc. Especially when playing with friends it's something that's quite fun.

However Factions isn't everything in FlexWorld, instead it's only one possible way of playing it. You can create complete new worlds, including planets, characters, items and even functionality.

So you just want a world where people can meet and chat? No problem, build it, remove all the Factions stuff and open the server for the public.

Want to bring it to an even higher level? Then you're probably a developer, and this is something where FlexWorld's biggest benefit kicks in:
Develop
As a developer (programmer, graphics artist, sound artist) you can use FlexWorld to create worlds completely from scratch. This includes graphics, sounds, music and scripts.

FlexWorld uses the Lua scripting language to provide logics - in all aspects. So with some little effort you can create new gamemodes or modify Factions.

FlexWorld has been designed to support custom assets from the beginning (as it is my personal goal: having a product that's not tied to one area). Let's do a little example: You always had that nice idea of a roleplay game. So you create a new world, create graphics and sounds (or use the ones from Factions) and provide the logics through Lua scripts.

You can also launch a 24/7 dedicated server. It's as simple as starting a new game on your local computer.

Features
Here's an incomplete list of features FlexWorld will include:


Built-in gamemode Factions.
OpenGL 3D graphics engine capable of modifying the whole world.
Designed to be extended: Add/change graphics, sounds, music and scripts.
Lua scripting language for creating own logics.
Single- and multiplayer (hybrid).
Multi-platform: Programmed in modern and standard C++ to ensure it runs at least on the big three (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
Auto-update/-download of assets when joining other servers having assets that you don't have (via a resource hashing system).
No DRM, no restrictions: What you create is yours.


Status
FlexWorld has been in development for more than 10 months. Core features like the client, server, much of the 3D engine, resource management, scripting and much more are already done and are currently in a refactoring process to harden the source code.

However it's still too early to provide releases or demos. A lot of features are still being worked on. For example the Factions gamemode hasn't been started yet due to the development of the scripting engine and missing assets.

What we need & what you get
We're programmers, that means we're really bad at the creative things like graphics, 3D models etc. These things need to be bought from professional artists.

Also we'd like to program the project in full-time to fasten the development and being able to fully concentrate on it.

Of course there're tons of other things that need to be paid, like a website (+ server), legal stuff (trademark, taxes, sales, ...).

So every buck you invest into this project will greatly help its development in all areas. Keep in mind the campaign doesn't has to reach its goal. Every contribution helps!

Of course we're not only asking for your help but also want to give something back (besides the game itself). Checkout the perks for some special features.

Contributions for those with a small wallet
We understand that a lot of people can't afford giving away money for something that hasn't even been completed. Therefore you can do other things if you like what we're doing.

Spread the word! Tell others of this project, blog/tweet about it, give us your ideas and suggestions. Do you like what you read? What didn't you like? Everything is helpful for us, so don't hesitate to drop your line.

<b></b><h3>Motivation</h3>The Idea of 
SmartBoard originated due to the founder, Sandeep Gupta’s laziness, 
especially during Delhi winters. Sandeep realized that it is incredibly 
difficult to switch on the lights during the night especially when you 
are sleeping away from switch board. Also, there were a lot of redundant
 activities like turning off lights at 10 pm, reducing the fan speed in 
the middle of the night etc., which could easily be automated and 
provide better sleep patterns for users of such technology.<b><br/></b><h3>Achievement</h3>Home-in-Hand

<p>Q: Wait, you are asking me for Rs 5 lakhs?</p>
<p>A: No, not at all. Whatever you contribute, starting from $1, would provide a great support to us. We recommend you to go for $85 (approx Rs 5000) perk which will give you a SmartBoard.</p>
<p>Q: You mention, 'it's all or nothing' in video, however, I see this is a flexible funding campaign?</p>
<p>A: True, while we made the video it was supposed to be a 'fixed funding' campaign. However, due to technical issue on Indiegogo with reimbursements to India, we had to go for flexible funding.<br/></p>
<p>Q: Why are all contributions in USD?</p>
<p>A: Indiegogo is an international platform and does not have an INR option. If you use Indian credit card, you would still be billed in INR, finally.<br/></p>
<p>Q: Does it connect to my wifi router?</p>
<p>A: Yes, SmartBoard connects to wifi router and is then available to be controlled via internet from your mobile app.</p>
<p>Q: How can I install this board?</p>
<p>A: Installation is 2 step procedure - (a) Wall mounting - This is trivial and can be done by any qualified electrician. (b) Blinkup - Connecting to your wifi router. This would be done with the help of mobile app. Refer to <a href=""https://www.home-in-hand.com/install"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.home-in-hand.com/blinkup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> for more details. Detailed step-by-step procedure would be provided along with SmartBoard.<br/></p>
<p>Q: Do I need to pay anything for shipping?</p>
<p>A: No, shipping is included. Please note, we ship only within India.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any future enhancements planned?</p>
<p>A: Yes, what we have prepared is the base for an IoT application. Currently, you can control manually. On the automation part, you can have schedule rules to run automatically. Further, we plan to enhance this to a generic rule engine. Imagine, you have to catch an early morning flight in winters and your geyser turns on automatically at an appropriate time, so that when you enter the bath you get hot water. But on regular days, the geyser turns on only at your office time. On hardware front, we plan to enhance it with a universal remote, so that your TV, STB, AC also become controllable.<br/></p>

A: No, not at all. Whatever you contribute, starting from $1, would provide a great support to us. We recommend you to go for $85 (approx Rs 5000) perk which will give you a SmartBoard.
Q: You mention, 'it's all or nothing' in video, however, I see this is a flexible funding campaign?
A: True, while we made the video it was supposed to be a 'fixed funding' campaign. However, due to technical issue on Indiegogo with reimbursements to India, we had to go for flexible funding.
Q: Why are all contributions in USD?
A: Indiegogo is an international platform and does not have an INR option. If you use Indian credit card, you would still be billed in INR, finally.
Q: Does it connect to my wifi router?
A: Yes, SmartBoard connects to wifi router and is then available to be controlled via internet from your mobile app.
Q: How can I install this board?
A: Installation is 2 step procedure - (a) Wall mounting - This is trivial and can be done by any qualified electrician. (b) Blinkup - Connecting to your wifi router. This would be done with the help of mobile app. Refer to here and here for more details. Detailed step-by-step procedure would be provided along with SmartBoard.
Q: Do I need to pay anything for shipping?
A: No, shipping is included. Please note, we ship only within India.
Q: Are there any future enhancements planned?
A: Yes, what we have prepared is the base for an IoT application. Currently, you can control manually. On the automation part, you can have schedule rules to run automatically. Further, we plan to enhance this to a generic rule engine. Imagine, you have to catch an early morning flight in winters and your geyser turns on automatically at an appropriate time, so that when you enter the bath you get hot water. But on regular days, the geyser turns on only at your office time. On hardware front, we plan to enhance it with a universal remote, so that your TV, STB, AC also become controllable.

<div>Twisted Metal &amp; Vigilante 8. Later on I found Crashday and Ex Machina. That was fun. Rolling around with armored beasts of destruction, making choices between speed, armor and firepower.

It went pretty well but my reallife forced me to stop it. Now i am back at it. I am wiser, more experienced. I really got the feeling i can do it this time. But like you could guess i need your help. I don't need to buy motivation but i need to buy, time, equipment, and skills.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What will happen.</h3> <p>I will develop a game of a forgotten genre. Vehicular combat game. I am planning to use the power of the Unreal Engine to realise this. Expect big maps, awesome effects and ofcourse tons of metal formed to different tools that can be used to obliterate your opponents. The more money i can collect - the more features you can expect from this just after the release. Customisable vehicles, weapons, new vehicle classes. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Vehicles.</h3>
<div>For now i have  three tiers of vehicles.</div>
<div>Makeshift Tier.</div>
<div>These are non military vehicles converted to use them like ones. Tractors, excavators, trucks. Armed mostly with low tech weaponry they are cheap and sturdy. </div>
<div>Military Tier.</div>
<div>These are vehicles that could be used for regular combat. Tanks, artillery, jeeps. Armed with conventional ballistic based weaponry they are just the middle tier in everything. </div>
<div>Prototype Tier.</div>
<div>Most advanced vehicles with prototype weaponry, prototype engines, prototype armor. Hover tanks, railgun artillery, energy shields. Very expensive but of course very efficient.</div>
<div>Now those 3 tiers are divided into classes. First i will describe the calsses that will definitly make it into the game, thereafter i describe the two that need more time to make them function correctly and will be included at the release only if enough funds raised.</div>
<div>Light class:</div>
<div>Vehicles used for intercepting and spotting enemy vehicles. Performance of their weaponry may vary but all of them are fast and agile. </div>
<div>Medium class:</div>
<div>Use them to protect keypoints and to attack from unexpected positions. Still fast, but can take a lot more of punishment.</div>
<div>Heavy class:</div>
<div>Slow, armored, powerful. Can push enemies back by their brute force. Take a lot of damage before they blow up.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Special classes:</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Ultraheavy class:</div>
<div>Very slow fortresses armed to the top with weapons fo every task. One of them is able to turn the whole game around. The other team needs to coordinate their actions to ever stop such a beast from destroying their base.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Flying class:</div>
<div>This class will afford changes to other classes aswell since they will need to be able to counter them. With this class every other class gets anti air vehicles too. </div>

you in your shirt pocket or handbag, anytime, anywhere, you could get the
information you need about your investment property at an instant, without
purchasing any expensive gadget and without studying any of the legislation.</p>
<p>Now <b>IMAGINE</b> this personal property professional was made
available to the individual property investor, that is cost effective, in fact,
I guarantee this system will cost the investor up to and more than <b>80%</b>
less in management fees than what they are paying right now.  There are a
lot of different software packages out there that are only made available to
the Real Estate offices, to improve their profits and efforts, yet they are
still unable to complete the tasks at the correct time, due to lack of time,
experience.  WHO loses out!!! Hmm.</p>
<p><b>What makes my system so different from all the others?</b><br/>
My system allows all investors / property owners to have control over their
investment property, not just the Real Estate Offices, it will supply all legal
documents in the correct order needed to start the tenancy, end a tenancy and
all other documents necessary throughout the tenancy.  Everything and anything
happening on the property regards to rent, repairs, and requests are delivered
to the owner at an instant, and actioned quicker than any property agent
could.  Better still all rent payments, repairs and requests are on file
forever, they cannot be lost or deleted. Up until now no system this detailed
has been made available to the owners due to Real Estate agents wanting their
business and let’s face it they aren't going to tell you, you can do it
yourself. Most important - No more waiting on rental payments until the end of
the month.<br/><br/><b>What are your reasons for using a Real Estate office for your property?</b><br/>
Investors use Real Estate agents due to lack of knowledge of the Residential
Tenancy laws and how to action accordingly.  The investors feel a sense of security believing everything is ok and your house is in
good hands, due to the sales pitch given.  The investor believe by using a
Real Estate office they will get a better quality tenant, there is an element
of truth in that but it should not be taken as fact.  The best person for
the job is <b>YOU!</b>, who else will look after your property better than
you.  To an agency you are just another number and an increase in their
weekly income.  Sorry to be a little in your face, but it’s the truth. 
Agencies have programs similar to help them complete the actions in a timely
manner, however due to lack of time and hands available, completing these tasks
in accordance to the law can get missed, forgotten or however they describe it
to you.  Even with the help of this programs they still allow a tenant to
be 4 weeks behind, breeches not remedied, lease renewals not signed, by the
time the owner finds out it’s too late and either leaves the owner without a
tenant without warning, or worse a tenant still living in the house without
payment.  </p>
<strong>What do we need for this system to work for us?<br/></strong>All an owner needs is a smart phone and / or a
home computer, iPad, tablet etc.  So no unnecessary spending needed, you
can use what you already have.  The system will still run even if you
don’t have a smart phone, but you will need to have access to a computer with
internet. Then all you do is, READ, APPROVE, DECLINE, MORE INFO, and
SEND.  Sounds easy enough doesn’t it.  Everything else will prompt
you and be automatically actioned in the correct time frame and within the
law.  Not only that you will have ME as your Property Professional helping
you.  <p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/978578/files/20141101231822-Picture1.png?1414909102"" src="""" style=""width: 609.62px; height: 204px;""/></p><p><b>Just a quick FAQ’s</b></p><p>
</p><p><b>Hey! I am and Interstate / overseas owner, can I still use the system?</b><br/>
Yes! I will have support professionals all around to carry out inspections,
letting, routine and ending.  But this will come at an additional cost,
but I assure you it will be far cheaper than what you are paying now.  If
you are interested in holding the discounted spot and to be notified when an
agent becomes available please donate under Interstate &amp; oversea owners.<br/><br/><b>I want the savings but don’t want to meet the tenants?</b><br/>
As above, Yes, the savings still there and professionals all around to carry
out all inspections at an additional cost.<br/><br/><b>Documents will be sent to my address, I don’t want the tenants to know where
I live.</b><br/>
I will intercept all documents that are sent, and forward back to you at no extra costs to
protect your privacy?</p>
<p><b>I’m not a skilled computer nut is
your software very easy use?</b><br/>
Yes, if you can send emails, text and complete forms on computer very easy. <br/><br/><strong>Now! To sum up?<br/></strong>This is a highly professional system with high security <strong>NOT</strong>
available at any Real Estate Office, with no locked in contract.  Invented
/ designed by a property professional, researched by a property

happening on the property regards to rent, repairs, and requests are delivered
to the owner at an instant, and actioned quicker than any property agent
could.  Better still all rent payments, repairs and requests are on file
forever, they cannot be lost or deleted. Up until now no system this detailed
has been made available to the owners due to Real Estate agents wanting their
business and let’s face it they aren't going to tell you, you can do it
yourself. Most important - No more waiting on rental payments until the end of
the month.What are your reasons for using a Real Estate office for your property?
Investors use Real Estate agents due to lack of knowledge of the Residential
Tenancy laws and how to action accordingly.  The investors feel a sense of security believing everything is ok and your house is in
good hands, due to the sales pitch given.  The investor believe by using a
Real Estate office they will get a better quality tenant, there is an element
of truth in that but it should not be taken as fact.  The best person for
the job is YOU!, who else will look after your property better than
you.  To an agency you are just another number and an increase in their
weekly income.  Sorry to be a little in your face, but it’s the truth. 
Agencies have programs similar to help them complete the actions in a timely
manner, however due to lack of time and hands available, completing these tasks
in accordance to the law can get missed, forgotten or however they describe it
to you.  Even with the help of this programs they still allow a tenant to
be 4 weeks behind, breeches not remedied, lease renewals not signed, by the
time the owner finds out it’s too late and either leaves the owner without a
tenant without warning, or worse a tenant still living in the house without
payment.  
What do we need for this system to work for us?All an owner needs is a smart phone and / or a
home computer, iPad, tablet etc.  So no unnecessary spending needed, you
can use what you already have.  The system will still run even if you
don’t have a smart phone, but you will need to have access to a computer with
internet. Then all you do is, READ, APPROVE, DECLINE, MORE INFO, and
SEND.  Sounds easy enough doesn’t it.  Everything else will prompt
you and be automatically actioned in the correct time frame and within the
law.  Not only that you will have ME as your Property Professional helping
you.  Just a quick FAQ’s
Hey! I am and Interstate / overseas owner, can I still use the system?
Yes! I will have support professionals all around to carry out inspections,
letting, routine and ending.  But this will come at an additional cost,
but I assure you it will be far cheaper than what you are paying now.  If
you are interested in holding the discounted spot and to be notified when an
agent becomes available please donate under Interstate & oversea owners.I want the savings but don’t want to meet the tenants?
As above, Yes, the savings still there and professionals all around to carry
out all inspections at an additional cost.Documents will be sent to my address, I don’t want the tenants to know where
I live.
I will intercept all documents that are sent, and forward back to you at no extra costs to
protect your privacy?
I’m not a skilled computer nut is
your software very easy use?
Yes, if you can send emails, text and complete forms on computer very easy. Now! To sum up?This is a highly professional system with high security NOT
available at any Real Estate Office, with no locked in contract.  Invented
/ designed by a property professional, researched by a property
professional, and sold by a property professional.  There are many more
features, far too many to list, reporting at its very best.  Believe me

the real thing.  Donate Today to help bring a needed professional
solution.

We were hooked :)</p>
<p>Returning home, to Romania, we decided to make our own version of a memory game, with hand painted illustrations of stuff we love: flowers, plants, birds, animals, patterns. </p>
<p>So this is how the prototype came to life, and besides being visually appealing it’s also such a great way to spend time with one or a big bunch of friends. It’s fun and challenging for kids and adults alike, and the more you play the crazier your memory gets. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433161318/figycxabuqsr0sqauzes.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433161333/ttlw7fszlxipxxybwzak.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>Aitch &amp; Saddo Memory Game</h4><p></p><p>The set is a collaborative work between Aitch and Saddo, it contains 48 cards with 24 unique illustrations printed on pieces of thick cardboard, sized 9 cm x 9 cm, which makes them easy to handle.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433161363/budrdzqiof1zzr3lw3kw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
