<h3>In A Nutshell</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Jonathan Chan, I write songs and I'm from Hong Kong! After more than a year's worth of songwriting, recording, mixing and mastering, I have finished my first ever full length album! This album revolves around the place I call home, the dreams and the memories, the images and experiences, struggles and triumphs. Amidst the darkening times, it hopes. Above is the lyric video of the lead single, Aroma. </p>
<p>I wrote and produced this album myself, these songs represent a lot to me and I believe they will represent a lot to many others too. I'm incredibly critical of my own work, this is the best work I've done and for me to say that this is the best work I've done to date is a big deal to me. In this day and age where music is bought and sold at the click of a mouse, I believe that being able to hand someone a CD will bring deeper connection and meaning to the songs. And looking at the way vinyl records are nowadays, this CD will probably be an antique in about 10 years, it could be a good investment! Hence, by committing to this project, I hope my music will become much more tangible and valuable to the people it reaches. I want these songs to be heard and they deserve to be realised physically. Plus, this is also a really good excuse to pull out the old walkman and relive the 90's, there's no pretending here, you know you want to.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need to print a minimum of 100 copies to get the album printed, printers will charge unreasonable amounts for any less or refuse to print at all. I think they're still slightly in denial about digital music. Printing is expensive and I'm a fresh grad, so you gotta help me out here. To help you make the decision, I've included a bonus track, you're welcome. Also, all backers will have their name down in the album booklet as supporters. I've even included an option for me recording you a cover song of your choice! If I don't reach the entire goal, I will cover the cost out of my own pocket and make sure my backers receive their albums and other perks, but McDonalds increased their special value meals from $21 to $22, so money is tight. Any extra after reaching the goal will go to the video production expense. Nowadays not even the MTR will leave alone on the train, so by supporting this campaign, you're not only supporting the local music scene, you're being miles better than the MTR (if that's saying much, but you guys are awesome anyway). </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I think that people out there need to hear these songs, I think it will inspire listeners and give them a new perspective on things going on around them, and you will be one of the first to experience that! Getting this album printed will get the music further than I could ever do so by performing. I believe also that having these albums printed physically opens up a channel of communication between me and listeners that will allow the songs to come alive and reach greater depths. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> If I don't reach the goal, I will have to pay the difference out of my own pocket and that will challenge my financial situation.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a="""">Hello, and thank you for checking out my campaign! My name is Sean Francis, and I am currently the creative force behind my solo project, Pigasus. So far, I have recorded two albums independently since November 2015, and I am now at the stage where I would like to have them released on CD.<br/><br/>This funds from this campaign will be entirely devoted to having both of the currently existing Pigasus albums released on CD. Normally, this is something that I would just do gigs for, but at the moment there isn't really a ""band"" to take on the road since it has been a solo recording project. That's why I have turned to Indiegogo, and of course my fans and friends, old and new, for support in this mighty endeavor. <br/><br/>Releasing an album (in this case, two) isn't necessarily hard, but it takes some serious resources if you want to create a professional physical artifact that you can be proud of for many years to come. That is where you, my prospective contributors, come in. Your contributions will help to make this dream of mine a reality. Pigasus has been my passion project since August 2015, and this is some of the most genuine and powerful music I have ever had the privilege to make. This music is important to me because it is genuinely inspired by major events that have taken place in my life recently, and that is why I have decided to take these albums to the next level.<br/><br/>In total, I hope to raise $2,000 with this campaign. I've been gathering research and getting quotes since November, and it will cost about $1,000 to have each album manufactured right here in Wyoming. This would be a small release, probably about 250 copies or less of each album. By conventional record release standards, this is pretty small peanuts, but it's pretty typical for artists like myself who are independent and DIY.<br/><br/>There are a number of different perks available for funding this release, which I hope you will check out. Lots of good stuff in there, and chances to grab both albums at once which is nice! Other goodies include two exclusive podcasts talking about the making of both Mk I and Rebel Spirit, in terms of how I actually recorded everything and the events that inspired the music.<br/><br/>One of the most frequent questions you get when you're doing crowdfunding is ""What if you don't make your goal,"" and it's a legitimate question, so here's the answer. If i don't make my goal, you still come out with all of the music that I have on offer, and the funds accumulated from my contributors will still go toward the release of both albums. Plain and simple. I'm not out to get rich off of my friends and fans, my goal is singular: get this music in your hands.<br/><br/>If you're still reading this, I'll assume that you're with me in this cause. There are a lot of good reasons that I have for seeing this campaign through to the end. I keep returning to the fact that this music is inspired by events in my life, and that is honestly the biggest reason that I am pushing this so hard. The first album, Mk I, was made in the wake of a very tumultuous time in my life. In the summer of 2015, my life took an unexpected turn when my sciatica went from manageable to miserable. I had been struggling with it for some time, and things finally got out of hand in June of 2015. The pain (which was being caused by some severely herniated discs impinging on my sciatic nerve) was unlike anything I had ever endured before, and it very effectively stopped me from being able to work or play music for a couple of months. <br/><br/>Eventually I was able to start getting treatment for it, which has turned the situation around significantly. Once I was strong enough to stand with a guitar again for more than a few minutes at a time, I started writing new material and reshaping material that I had written with some of my other bands in mind. The material came together very quickly, and I was inspired to record the guitar and vocal parts. The other instrument parts came together quickly, which was surprising since I hadn't been able to play much drums or bass over the summer. <br/><br/>Much of what emerged lyrically on Mk I is about meeting changes and challenges head on, as well as having the fortitude to push through the hard times into better days. During that summer, I connected with a number of people who were also suffering from chronic pain conditions. A common thread running through all of our lives was the need for a return to normalcy, but also a need for solace and hope through the recovery. I tried to reflect this struggle in the song ""Living In The Ruin,"" which is about chronic pain and how exhausting it is both physically and psychologically. <br/><br/>The album Mk I was pre-released on Bandcamp in January 2016 to help fund the final stages of production, and it is currently being mixed and mastered by Patrick Hogg, (Sludge Studios). With that album all packed up, I started work on Rebel Spirit as a part of the 2016 RPM Challenge. The challenge was to write and record an album (minimum 10 songs/35 minutes) in the month of February. This album is a body of work that I'm very proud of. I was still recording even on the very last day of February and submitted the album to RPM at 5:36 a.m. on March 1, 2016 after spending most of the night doing the first mix of the album.<br/><br/>Rebel Spirit is a special project to me. Instead of using my Fostex VF160 and my computer to produce this album, I used a Tascam Porta One Mini Studio, which is an analog four-track tape recorder. I was able to make a very powerful sounding album with a tape machine, an old Allen &amp; Heath GL2 Mixer, and a handful of microphones. The Fostex machine did come back into play for recording vocals, but all of the instrument recordings are 100% analog. Lyrically, Rebel Spirit is about a growing disenchantment that I have been feeling while watching events unfold in the media like some kind of circus. All the while, nothing significant changes, and people are numb to the chaos around them. Internally, I fight to resist this desensitized existence, and disavow the culture of prejudice and fear whose roots run deep. My friend and former bandmate Kaleb Richey has agreed to mix and master Rebel Spirit. As of today (March 18, 2016) I will be submitting the tracks to him so that the album will be produced while this campaign is running. <br/><br/>Indiegogo is a great tool for gathering support from people who believe in your project and your passion. In 2013 my former band Harpoon, the Whale raised funds for it's first album, We All Glow, We All Fade with Indiegogo. That campaign ended up meeting its goal and then some - enough to make an EP (Seeing Things In Green) while the full album was being mixed and mastered. This is my first time doing an Indiegogo campaign on my own, and I'm excited to watch this come to fruition. With your help, this can become a genuine DIY dual cd release. Even if you aren't able to contribute financially, you can still help by sharing this campaign on your social media. </div>","Hello, and thank you for checking out my campaign!

<p>
</p><p><span></span></p><p>C’est en 2012 que j’ai eu l’idée de fonder le Festival d’été Passovah (FEP) pour célébrer la musique locale. Lors de sa première édition, 24 artistes locaux se sont produits sur la scène du <i>Il Motore</i> pour de courtes performances. La programmation ambitieuse et la formule “payez selon vos moyens” du festival ont assuré son succès. La troisième édition du festival (2014) etait la plus audacieuse jusqu’à présent : 4 jours de spectacles avec plus de 60 artistes dans 6 salles, appuyé par une équipe d’employés et de bénévoles. Également au programme : un party d’ouverture et une soirée dansante, le tout couronné par une performance électrisante de Suuns. C’était fou, fou, fou!</p><p></p><div>Malgré les succès des années précédentes, festival dépend toujours de la bonne volonté et du travail acharné - et pour la plupart sous-rémunéré - de l’équipe. Bref, nous n’acceptons plus que nos artistes et notre équipe de production travaillent pour des pinottes. Alors voici ce que nous souhaitons pour la quatrième édition: un festival de plus grande envergure avec une ambiance plus professionnelle, mais surtout un festival qui reflète mieux les convictions de Passovah. Nous faisons donc appel à votre aide pour ramasser les quelques milliers de dollars qui permettront au festival de prendre son essor.<p></p>
<p>FEP est avant tout un festival de musique. Nous sommes fiers d’avoir présenté des centaines de groupes durant nos éditions précédentes.</p>

<p>
</p><h2><span>Raison d’être du festival</span></h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Un festival montréalais conçu
     par des montréalais et complètement dévoué à la magie de la scène locale.</span></li>
<li>Une plateforme pour diffuser la
     musique émergente dans un contexte qui nous plaît (et qui plaît d’ailleurs
     aux artistes!)</li>
<li>Spectacles abordables où on
     invite les gens à découvrir des artistes de la scène locale.</li>
<li>Un lieu de rencontre pour les
     artistes locaux où ils peuvent d’ailleurs collaborer et faire mûrir leurs
     projets.</li>
<li>Un milieu où règnent la
     diversité et l’inclusion.</li>
<li>Salles de spectacles de premier
     plan.</li>
<li>Expérience de scène pour
     artistes émergents.</li>
<li>Équipe expérimentée et
     astucieuse à l’affût de la scène locale.</li>
<li>Un milieu sain et engageant où
     les musiciens peuvent acquérir les outils et l’expérience pour travailler
     dans une industrie internationale.</li>
<li>Nous reconnaissons et
     respectons les origines et les objectifs variés des artistes.</li>
</ul><div><br/></div>
<p>
</p><h2><b><span>Pourquoi demandons-nous votre aide? Et quelques mots sur
les retombées du festival.</span></b></h2>
<p>Cette campagne de financement a pour
but d’assurer la pérennité et la diversité du FEP pour les années à venir. Ce
financement, en plus d’assurer le bon déroulement du festival, couvrira les
cachets versés aux artistes, la location de salles et d’équipement, de même que
les frais de publicité.</p>
<p><br/>
Si notre campagne Indiegogo réussit, nous allons...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Augmenter les sommes versées
     aux artistes et à l’équipe du festival.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Augmenter le nombre d’entrées
     en rejoignant un public de plus en plus large et diversifié.</li>
<li>Mettre l’accent sur les aspects
     professionnels du festival, au profit des artistes et des participants.</li>
<li>Améliorer la qualité sonore des
     spectacles grâce à la location d’équipement audio.</li>
<li>Engager une équipe de marketing
     pour accroître le rayonnement du festival à Montréal et dans ses environs</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Nous avons plein de bonnes idées,
mais nous voulons les mener à bien sans faire sauter la banque. Nous sommes
présentement à la recherche d’autres sources de financement; cependant, cette
campagne de financement participatif nous aidera à décoller. Grâce à vos dons,
nous aurons les moyens de réaliser un festival inclusif qui met les artistes ET

<h2>What is Passovah Summer Fest?</h2>
<p>In 2012, I came up with the idea for the Passovah Summer Fest (PSF), with the
intention of celebrating local music. The first edition of the festival took
place at Il Motore and featured 24 local acts performing short sets over two
days. Despite the ambitious premise, the pay what you can mini-festival went
off without a hitch. <span><a href=""http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/montreals_passovah_fest_gets_ps_i_love_you_cousins_frog_eyes_suuns"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Last year</a> (the 3rd edition) was
the most ambitious to date: 4 days, more than 60 acts, and 6 fantastic venues.
We had a staff, volunteers, an opening event, a dance party, and a blowout
Suuns show. It was wild!</span></p>
<p>The previous years have been great. But the honest truth is that PSF runs on the good will and almost exclusively undervalued labour of the people who make the festival possible. We at Passovah are tired of paying musicians and our staff next to nothing for their effort. We seek to make the 4th edition of PSF bigger, better, more professional, and most importantly more consistent with the Passovah ethics. To make this
possible we need your help to raise a few thousand dollars to get the festival
off the ground.</p><p>Above all PSF is about the music. We're proud to have had hundreds of acts over the last few years.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1422310/files/20150428090031-artists.png?1430236831"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>

Le festival d’été Passovah, c’est quoi?

C’est en 2012 que j’ai eu l’idée de fonder le Festival d’été Passovah (FEP) pour célébrer la musique locale. Lors de sa première édition, 24 artistes locaux se sont produits sur la scène du Il Motore pour de courtes performances. La programmation ambitieuse et la formule “payez selon vos moyens” du festival ont assuré son succès. La troisième édition du festival (2014) etait la plus audacieuse jusqu’à présent : 4 jours de spectacles avec plus de 60 artistes dans 6 salles, appuyé par une équipe d’employés et de bénévoles. Également au programme : un party d’ouverture et une soirée dansante, le tout couronné par une performance électrisante de Suuns. C’était fou, fou, fou!Malgré les succès des années précédentes, festival dépend toujours de la bonne volonté et du travail acharné - et pour la plupart sous-rémunéré - de l’équipe. Bref, nous n’acceptons plus que nos artistes et notre équipe de production travaillent pour des pinottes. Alors voici ce que nous souhaitons pour la quatrième édition: un festival de plus grande envergure avec une ambiance plus professionnelle, mais surtout un festival qui reflète mieux les convictions de Passovah. Nous faisons donc appel à votre aide pour ramasser les quelques milliers de dollars qui permettront au festival de prendre son essor.
FEP est avant tout un festival de musique. Nous sommes fiers d’avoir présenté des centaines de groupes durant nos éditions précédentes.



Raison d’être du festival


Un festival montréalais conçu
     par des montréalais et complètement dévoué à la magie de la scène locale.
Une plateforme pour diffuser la
     musique émergente dans un contexte qui nous plaît (et qui plaît d’ailleurs
     aux artistes!)
Spectacles abordables où on
     invite les gens à découvrir des artistes de la scène locale.
Un lieu de rencontre pour les
     artistes locaux où ils peuvent d’ailleurs collaborer et faire mûrir leurs
     projets.
Un milieu où règnent la
     diversité et l’inclusion.
Salles de spectacles de premier
     plan.
Expérience de scène pour
     artistes émergents.
Équipe expérimentée et
     astucieuse à l’affût de la scène locale.
Un milieu sain et engageant où
     les musiciens peuvent acquérir les outils et l’expérience pour travailler
     dans une industrie internationale.
Nous reconnaissons et
     respectons les origines et les objectifs variés des artistes.


Pourquoi demandons-nous votre aide? Et quelques mots sur
les retombées du festival.
Cette campagne de financement a pour
but d’assurer la pérennité et la diversité du FEP pour les années à venir. Ce
financement, en plus d’assurer le bon déroulement du festival, couvrira les
cachets versés aux artistes, la location de salles et d’équipement, de même que
les frais de publicité.

Si notre campagne Indiegogo réussit, nous allons...


Augmenter les sommes versées
     aux artistes et à l’équipe du festival.


Augmenter le nombre d’entrées
     en rejoignant un public de plus en plus large et diversifié.
Mettre l’accent sur les aspects
     professionnels du festival, au profit des artistes et des participants.
Améliorer la qualité sonore des
     spectacles grâce à la location d’équipement audio.
Engager une équipe de marketing
     pour accroître le rayonnement du festival à Montréal et dans ses environs


Nous avons plein de bonnes idées,
mais nous voulons les mener à bien sans faire sauter la banque. Nous sommes
présentement à la recherche d’autres sources de financement; cependant, cette
campagne de financement participatif nous aidera à décoller. Grâce à vos dons,
nous aurons les moyens de réaliser un festival inclusif qui met les artistes ET
les participants à l’avant-scène. Malgré les succès de l’an dernier, la
situation financière du festival demeure précaire. Et voilà pourquoi nous
demandons votre aide. Avec cette campagne, nous souhaitons également soutenir
un dialogue sur la viabilité de l’industrie musicale. Alors n’hésitez pas de
participer au forum de discussion de la campagne FEP!
Merci d’avance pour vos dons! Nous
nous fixons un objectif de 5000 $ pour cette campagne, mais nous souhaitons
bien le dépasser. Plus vous donnez, plus vous aidez! Si nous atteignons notre
cible de 5000 $, nous établirons un cachet minimum pour tous les artistes.
Certains artistes gagnerons plus que le minimum, mais aucun artiste ne tombera
sous le seuil établi. D’ailleurs, chaque donateur recevra un remerciement sur
notre site web. 
Si nous dépassons les 10 000 $, nous
augmenterons encore le cachet minimum. DE PLUS, vous recevrez un article
arborant le logo de Passovah pour vos dons de 20 $ ou plus!
Si nous ramassons 15 000 $ ou plus,
le cachet minimum versé aux artistes passera à 150 $. Nous organiserons
également une fête après le festival pour tous les artistes, l’équipe de
production et tous ceux qui auront fait un don à la campagne de financement!
En donnant vos sous, vous assurez le
succès de cette quatrième édition du festival ET la pérennité du festival pour
les années à venir.

I am a drag performer and aspiring musician. The reason why I am making this campaign is to help me raise money to get my first album produced by a really great producer that I am hoping to work with. I know that indiegogo's have been very helpful in the past with aspiring artists like myself, and I would love to finally put out the album i've been writing and working on for a couple of years now.  All of the lyrics are ready to go.  I just need to get equiptment for recording vocals and the funds to produce this album.<br/><br/>I have been working on this project for a while because it is something that I have put a lot of emotion into over the last few years.

All of the lyrics are ready to go.  I just need to get equiptment for recording vocals and the funds to produce this album.I have been working on this project for a while because it is something that I have put a lot of emotion into over the last few years.

<p><strong>In my life I want to bring together my musical abilities and my family responsibilities with this ptoject. Presently my wife and I look after our extraordinary 23 year son, who has a label of ""profound &amp; multiple learning disabilities"" and is a wonderful joy to be with! So I need to create a musical pathwaywhich respects this vital part of my life and allows me to bring my singing a &amp; songwriting abilities to people too: The Humanitarium Project!<br/></strong></p>
<p><br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Humanitarium Project</strong> (Phase 1 - <strong>THIS ONE!</strong>) starts in France, in Autumn 2013</p>
<ul>
<li>8 musician-songwriters from 5 continents are coming together for 6 days to share the endeavour of co-creating &amp; playing 12 original song-pieces on 1 album – for you!</li>
<li>This Summer Recording &amp; Songwriting project is organized and co-ordinated by Fergus &amp; Gaia; here's a link to a video by them about it: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy7gyVFjGNE&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUyoW8NDbU6eG4XeUhs_4ENw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy7gyVFjGNE&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUyoW8NDbU6eG4XeUhs_4ENw</a>

</ul>
<p><strong>We’ll generate synergy – we’ll incinerate energy – because you’re worth it!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To be involved with this is a great honour for me, so I’m delighted to invite you to join in! I’ve always wanted to do something like this (since I was 15 years old!) but have been aware, and wary, of the amount of exploitation in the music business.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> The Humanitarium Project is where you come in!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Phase 1</strong> <strong>(THIS ONE!)</strong> is the “live” studio album co created and played by 8 of us, is it in a nutshell.</li>
<li>
<strong>Phase 2</strong> will be a solo album from myself, including songs around disability (Nov/Dec 2013) – “Reaching Out Inside”</li>
<li>
<strong>Phase 3</strong> will be an inclusive double album with people with learning disabilities &amp; musicians (&amp; me!) -  a mixture of original live &amp; studio tracks, (Jan/Mar 2014) –  “Musiclusion”</li>
</ol>
<p>How much you decide to give is up to you (see perks below): remember publicity is as valuable as money - if you can get someone like, say, Stephen Fry to re-tweet my Indiegogo pitch on Twitter ….! (Then what I could achieve increases exponentially &amp; all my costs go up a thousandfold and it’s an album a month for the next 10 years!)(Also all our servers crash!)</p>
<ul>
<li>

I was in the school choir from 11 years old (first soprano then tenor eventually bass) I was a drummer and vocalist in various bands (hippy then heavy rock then melodic rock then alternative then punk then commune then thrash rock duo then indie) between the ages of 16-34. Since then I’ve learnt melody instruments (!) : some guitar, some banjo, some tamboura, some ukulele (soprano) &amp; some more ukulele (baritone this time!)<strong>              </strong>I’ve  written 200-300 songs over that time, the last 3 years have been really productive during which I’ve written about 100 of them, &amp; more seem to be arriving each week!</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with all this I’ve been involved with people and learning disabilities (especially PMLD) for over 20 years now, including some wonderful music projects and performances!           </p>
<p>I’m a hard worker, for music, for inclusion, for an alternative to competition &amp; exploitation, nothing will be wasted in our shared endeavour of acceptance through creativity.    </p>

   We need your help to recover our costs for duplication, graphics & have some left over for promotion. (We put close to $2000 on our credit card & $1000 is not a lot for promotion, especially these days when artists are doing it on their own and not through the big studios).
***We do have some great gifts or ""perks"" to offer for your donations! -- check them out on the side panels. We have just added some new ones. View pics in our Gallery.
     Here's our BHAKTI BLISS II musicians: 
   Most of our group has been doing kirtan for a number of years.  I, personally, came onto the Spiritual Path way back in the late 70's.  One of my first chanting experiences was with Ram Dass & it literally changed my life.  (That will soon be posted on my website and our Door of the Heart Music Channel on YouTube).   www.RobertKelaghan.com
   Since then, chanting has been a major emphasis in my sadhana or spiritual practice & I've started several other Kirtan groups,e.g., the ""Crazy Karma Kirtan Band.""   Yoga itself has been the central facet of my adult life.  I still teach yoga for a living & draw great inspiration from the lives of Masters like Paramhansa Yogananda, Neem Karoli Baba & Ammachi (the ""Hugging Saint"").  
   My favorite thing in the whole world is taking an extended period of time (day, weekend, or even week) to dive into all aspects of Yoga:  the postures, the breathwork, meditation, chanting, sacred song & dance, etc.  
  And nothing gives me greater satisfaction than helping others connect to the deepest part of their beings through the above practices ..... and always, always, the day ends with devotional music or chanting .....   So, do check out our music & our gifts to you & help us get this music out to the growing number of people who are searching for greater understanding, peace & joy in their lives.  There is so much anxiety in our world today & Kirtan is a wonderful antidote to that!  
   Thanks for partnering with us in this sacred endeavor & may Great Karma fill all your days for your help & support !!!(Note:  We originally raised $3500 via our website in our local area -- near Sacramento, CA. & now we feel this music should be offered to a wider audience so we are reaching out to the Global Family of Kirtan lovers. Your contribution will help our purpose which is stated in our logo:  ""Music To Touch The Soul."" )(Note 2:  We will be tithing 10% of all funds received with 2 organizations that have been inspirational to us:  The Sierra Center for Spiritual Living in Grass Valley, CA & Polestar Gardens Yoga Community near Pahoa, HI.)   OM",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Brits Team is working with the award-winning UK charity Afghan Heroes to raise public awareness of who this charity is.The founder has adopted 'We Are The Brits' as their anthem, saying, ""This is who we are and what we are doing""! This charity sent home comfort parcels to every front line UK service man and woman in Afghanistan for Armed Forces Day and we now want to get the song to as many soldiers on the front line as we can because it was written for them to let them know we care and they are never forgotten. To do this we need your help.<br/>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The writers of 'We Are The Brits' Anton Lorien and John Simons are working with the founders to inspire people to get behind this charity so we can do more to help the servicemen and women on the front line. The writers could easily have given the song to a much larger military charity in the UK (not mentioning any names) who loved and wanted the song, and it would have been an instant 'hit' but they wanted to work with Afghan Heroes as they know that keeping the morale high of the boys on the front line is paramount to keeping them safe from harm.<br/>  
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It was founded by mothers whose sons died within the same 24 hours in what has been described as the blackest day in Helmand when 8 soldiers fell. The guys on the front line have direct email contact with the founder of the charity and whatever they need she does her utmost to provide to make their tour easier to bear. The charity also supports the families of the fallen and those who return from duty traumatised from what they have witnessed. To help the guys more the charity needs much more support, in the UK not many people know of Afghan Heroes despite being given an award by HRH Prince Harry at The Sun's (UK newspaper) Military Award event. HRH Prince William and HRH Prince Harry wear Afghan Heroes wristbands! By getting this out to the guys on the front line we hope to raise the public's awareness of the charity as we will gain major media coverage. :)</span></strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">For every $5 donated a soldier will receive a CD of the song including the bonus dance track. If you give us your email we will email you an mp3 of We Are The Brits plus the exclusive Dance mix version which is not available anywhere else as well as the digital artwork. Please give generously, it's not just a song but a poignant and uplifting message for everyone (the video is very humorous too, after all we're Brits so that's a bit compulsory). </span><br/></strong></p>

<p>Fueled by the energy of a group of composers, performers, and music-lovers devoted to the limitless possibilities of new music, our concert series aims to present a wide array of inspiring concerts to the greater Boston musical community. We took shape in 2011, growing out of a desire to provide a forum for emerging local artists as well as for the discussions and connections that the experience of live performance fosters. We seek to enrich Boston’s music scene by presenting new local works and recent masterpieces.</p>
<p>We are diverse and flexible, we think outside the box, we welcome new friends, we explore and take risks, we love sounds that are strange, beautiful, eccentric, ear-twisting, lavish, and piquant!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is new music?</h2>
<p>“Use your ears like a man!” the pioneering American composer Charles Ives famously said. We believe that using your ears like a real man or woman is an active pursuit. Seek out new sounds, react, and share your thoughts with others. New music, rooted in the classical tradition, is a live process of creation and evolution: it’s being invented by today’s composers and interpreted by today’s performers.</p>
<p>Music-making is also a community activity. Music helps us understand ourselves and our changing world. It reaches its full potential when produced through collaboration and experienced in the moment. That’s why the composers and performers we feature work together to bring new works to life in an assortment of venues throughout the Boston area. We’re not restricted to the concert hall—we’ve performed in galleries, studios, and theaters. We’re always seeking out new audience members to share in this experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What are we planning?</h2>
<p>This spring we’ve got our most ambitious season yet, with six truly unique offerings. Our two centerpiece concerts feature the music of Boston composers who deserve to be heard more frequently, performed by the Equilibrium Ensemble and special guests. Ensemble players will be featured in a program of <strong>chamber works</strong> by Chaya Czernowin, Marti Epstein, and Yu-Hui Chang that celebrate our ideals of community-based collaboration. The fabulous soprano <strong>Aliana de la Guardia </strong>will be the featured guest in an ensemble performance of works by Masaki Hasebe and Keeril Makan.</p>
<p>We also host up-and-coming groups devoted to expanding the horizons of sound in every direction. We’re welcoming our friends the innovative <strong>Iktus Percussion Quartet</strong> from NYC. And the local <strong>Modern Brass </strong>quintet will explore unknown corners of a genre usually known for fanfares and marches.</p>
<p>Two funky <strong>Composer on stage </strong>concerts will explore the nebulous path from inspiration to execution in casual, intimate settings. The first features guitarist and composer Clifton Ingram in semi-structured improvisations with classical/jazz bassist Max Judelson, and the second presents popular locals Marti Epstein, John McDonald, and Mischa Salkind-Pearl on the piano.</p>
<p>Take a look at our <a href=""http://equilibriumconcertseries.org/news/current-season/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current season</a> listing for more details.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What have we done so far?</h2>
<p>Though we're only in our second year, we're proud of what we've accomplished so far in our young life! In 2012 we presented 8 concerts, gave life to 30 world premieres, and hosted 3 guest ensembles in 6 off-the-beaten-path venues. Our first season culminated in the first installment of the <a href=""http://equilibriumconcertseries.org/2012/05/23/notes-on-an-evening-of-art-and-music-and-again-this-thursday/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hyman Bloom Project</a> last May, two gallery shows featuring new chamber works composed in honor of the first posthumous solo exhibition of the abstract expressionist painter Hyman Bloom, performed alongside the paintings that inspired them.</p>
<p>We've had the pleasure of hosting the lovely Balletik Duo at Cambridge's Gallery 263, a set of wonderful soloists in a salon at SONiVOX studios in Somerville, the wildly creative duo Transient Canvas twice at the Davis Square Theatre, and percussionist Masako Kunimoto and friends at Inman Square's iconic Lilypad. We want to continue to bring new music to new corners of Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline in our quest for concert experiences that are unusual, meaningful, and thought-provoking.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why do we need help?</h2>
<p>Getting a concert series off the ground is a huge undertaking—in organizational, philosophical, and financial ways. Because we're a presenting organization, we have to cover all of our production and operating costs ourselves--we're not sponsored or in residence at any institution. We’ve put countless hours of thought and effort into planning. But the bottom line is: to grow we need to do concerts! And concerts come with many expenses, chiefly the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue rental can range from $150 to $1200 per event, depending on the size and location of the space. A rental must often also include time for set-up, sound check, and packing up, talking, and unwinding after the concert.</li>
<li>Performers’ fees: we are incredibly lucky to work with players who are equally as generous as they are talented. Our players are devoted to performing new music, and we’re working towards compensating them a decent amount for the hours they contribute to learning, rehearsing, and performing our music. Just think: most performers have spent a good part of their lives learning their instruments' standared repertoires, but learning a world premiere requires starting at square one! We'll have over 30 talented young professional musicians performing with us this spring, and we want to help them be able to do what they do so well.</li>
<li>We must purchase or rent scores and parts for the published works we program; each piece can cost anywhere from $30 to $800.</li>
<li>Production costs can include piano tuning, transport of large instruments, and printing programs, among other tasks.</li>
<li>Publicity costs include maintaining our website and online presence, printing physical fliers, business cards, and other items.</li>
</ul><p>And one of the most important reasons we need your help: we are dedicated to keeping our ticket prices low or free, so that no one is prevented from attending due to cost. Many of our patrons show their support in donations at the door, but we don't take in nearly enough to cover our costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Many ways to show your support!</h2>
<p>If you believe that music is a living, evolving art, there are many ways to contribute! Even a small donation will help move our vision forward. If you're able to give a little more, we're pleased to offer a hodgepodge of thank-you perks!</p>
<p>But most importantly, if you're interested in or curious about what we do, please join us for a concert! Invite others! Or drop us a line with your musings, rants, or raves.</p>

<em><strong>Tape Deck Mountain</strong></em> is almost done with our 2nd full length record titled <em>Sway</em>! Unfortunately I (Travis) could use some extra cash to help put the finishing touches on this Masterpiece.  The hard part is over, all the songs are recorded and done!  We just need some help in getting the album released in proper fashion!  We are looking to raise 4000 to get the album produced in a physical format and some other loose ends (Mastering, Promotion, Etc.)</div>

<p>Our 2nd LP is 11 songs proper and our strongest work to date!  Most of the album was written and rehearsed during my year long stint in Austin, TX. During that year I rehearsed and performed with <strong>John Momberg</strong> (whom played some amazing drums! and helped arrange the songs!) and <strong>Dan Alvarez</strong> (whom layed down some solid bass!).  <strong><em>The drums and bass were tracked to 2"" tape by Matt Oliver at Big Orange Studios in Austin and sound beautiful!</em> </strong>We bounced down what we had to a hard drive and took it back to my hometown in San Diego, CA to finish things up with <strong>Brandon Jenson</strong> of <strong>American Sound Studios</strong>.  I have since begun living in Queens, NY and working at the local coffee shop. I'm going to stop here and not give you typical starving artist story (we've all heard it!). <em>But rest assured I live a very frugal lifestyle and the money raised from IndieGoGo will not be taken lightly!</em></p>

<h3>Tape Deck Mountain Story</h3>
<div>For those of you new to Tape Deck Mountain let me give a short timeline. I (Travis Trevisan) started the band in 2009 as vehicle for songs I write with the aide of a revolving cast of musicians helping out and contributing. Since then the band has released 1 Full Length Album &amp; 3 EPs. <em> We have toured the West Coast numerous times and circled the US and pockets of Canada last summer for 35 days. Hitting up music festivals such as SXSW, NXNE, &amp; CMJ over the years.</em> Since our first full length we have worked with Lefse Records and garnered <em>press from heavy weights such as Pitchfork Media, Filter Magazine, Vice, Stereogum, and Fader among others</em>.  </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>
<em><strong>Needless to say this next record could be the triumph of Tape Deck Mountain's career, if done right!</strong></em>  </h3>
<div> </div>
<div>Regardless I'm very proud of it artistically and believe it is the bands best and most focused work to date! I am very excited to share it with many amazing people in this world!</div>

the Shenandoah Valley, our band The Travelin’ Hillbillies is comprised of four
tightknit musicians and have developed a style that is uniquely our own.  Our soulful tunes that include hints of
bluegrass, rock and roll, folk, blues, and country differentiate us from any
other band on the scene.  We—Garst brothers
Ryan, Shay, and Brandon along with vocal powerhouse and long-time friend Daniel
Barnett—have been working endlessly to share music that is close to our hearts.  In just 2 short years, we have played over 200
shows as The Travelin’ Hillbillies while holding full-time jobs to fulfill our
dreams of becoming one of the biggest bands to emerge on the southern rock
scene from Virginia.</p>
<h2>Our Campaign</h2><p>We’ve decided
that it’s time to get real!  Thanks to Chris
Jackson and Chris Perez of Blue Sprocket Media, recording for our new studio EP
is underway.  <i>Touch and Go</i> represents our growth into a true southern rock band.  All we need now is support from our fans to help
this album make history.  By contributing
to our campaign, you will be helping our band make our dreams come true by
helping us create the opportunity always wish we had.</p>
<p>We plan on
releasing <i>Touch and Go </i>by the end of
July.  If we exceed our campaign goals,
however, we would like to keep recording to finish the EP as an entire
album.  Choosing only a few of our new
songs has been intense, and we would love to release even more of our new
material.</p>
<p>For this EP, we
still have some expenses to cover.  Studio expenses remaining with Blue Sprocket Media are $2,400.  Video production and promotion costs with
Lurid Pictures are $300.  Updating our website
with Polytone Design will be about $300 as well.</p>
<p>Even if we
don’t reach our goal, we will put every penny that we have received toward all
the expenses we’ve encountered.  If we
raise more, there are plenty of things we still need for the band:</p>
<p></p><ul>

our gear!</p>
<p>By
contributing to our campaign, you’ll be helping our dream of releasing a studio
album even closer.  Help prove to the
music industry that a homegrown band can be successful without a record label,
tens of thousands of dollars, or hired songwriters.  We want YOUR help to spearhead the movement of
keeping originality in the art in music.</p>
<p>Our band has
come so far without ever having asked for money, so we know that we can accomplish
so much more with just a little help from our fans.</p>

music industry that a homegrown band can be successful without a record label,
tens of thousands of dollars, or hired songwriters.  We want YOUR help to spearhead the movement of
keeping originality in the art in music.
Our band has
come so far without ever having asked for money, so we know that we can accomplish
so much more with just a little help from our fans.
Aside from the CampaignEven if you
can’t contribute, tell your friends to simply like us on Facebook and check out our Youtube channel.  
We want people to know what we’re up to and for our fans to come see us
at shows.  We also encourage you to use the
Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word about our campaign.
Finally, we
want to thank you for viewing this page. 
We are forever grateful for all the support all our incredible fans have
given us.

<p>The unique thing about this campaign is that it is largely designed to create an exciting experience to get our album to you. It gives sweet deals to you, our dedicated fans, and in-turn helps us continue to create music that matters to you. <br/></p>
<p>So poke around our campaign and check out all of the amazing perks we've lined up for you. Every perk includes an early release digital copy of our recording, plus a digital copy of our new single ""Unstoppable"" that we recorded with Mark Lee Townsend (Relient K's producer) upon receiving payment. Don't forget to grab a pre-order of the album while you're at it.<br/></p>
<p>In exchange for your contributions, here are some of the some cool perks:</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are D.F.T., A five piece Indie Rock/Folk, Irish band based in cork. We need your help to record an album. We have been together since late 2010, and have played live in many cork venues, as well as in belfast. We have appeared on ""Balcony T.V."" and ""Red Fm"". We have been planning to record an album for months, but a lack of money has stopped our efforts. We have a few studios in mind in which to record our album, and we will make our pick when we see how successful the campaign is. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the success of this campaign, we would have enough funds to go into the studio and make an album. With your help, we can record, promote and advertise the album. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Basically, we need around 1000 to record the album. That 1000 breaks down into: Paying the studio, for hostels (Don't worry, they're cheap) to sleep in when we are recoding this album, for advertising the album, and finally for making the artwork, cover, and case, and covering the publishing costs. We will also be funding this campaign ourselves, but we can't afford the entire cost of the venture, and we need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>(Unleash the DIWO! -- 'Do It With Others' by asking folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Don't forget to remind them about the share tools!)</p>

We are D.F.T., A five piece Indie Rock/Folk, Irish band based in cork. We need your help to record an album. We have been together since late 2010, and have played live in many cork venues, as well as in belfast. We have appeared on ""Balcony T.V."" and ""Red Fm"". We have been planning to record an album for months, but a lack of money has stopped our efforts. We have a few studios in mind in which to record our album, and we will make our pick when we see how successful the campaign is. 


The Impact
With the success of this campaign, we would have enough funds to go into the studio and make an album. With your help, we can record, promote and advertise the album. 

What We Need & What You Get
Basically, we need around 1000 to record the album. That 1000 breaks down into: Paying the studio, for hostels (Don't worry, they're cheap) to sleep in when we are recoding this album, for advertising the album, and finally for making the artwork, cover, and case, and covering the publishing costs. We will also be funding this campaign ourselves, but we can't afford the entire cost of the venture, and we need your help.

Other Ways You Can Help
(Unleash the DIWO! -- 'Do It With Others' by asking folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Don't forget to remind them about the share tools!)

<h3>Our Story<br/><br/>
</h3>Im Rachel Chetti and 21 years old. I been singing for as long as I can remember and its only taken me 21 years to realize that's what I want to do!

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><br/>Music has been my life for as long I can remember, and I feel like I have this amazing opportunity to go after my dream.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and you never know what can happen. If I dont make it, Im still going to keep trying. I'll probably take some music classes and keep looking for opportunities to get out there.<br/><br/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/><br/>I was debating between either driving up there or flying. After doing some calculations, I realized it is cheaper to drive up there. So on August 27th Ill be driving from here(Oregon) to California. But it is going expensive and is probably going to be anywhere in between 500-600$.That is just a rough estimate.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am thrilled to have been invited to perform at Canadian Music Week in Toronto in just a few weeks and then to be returning to the West Coast for a 10 stop tour! (my very first).  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having been featured at the Vancouver jazz fest and some other pretty cool things like radio play across Canada and being put on a Women in Jazz compilation CD, I'm pretty stoked to bring my career to the next level.  This is done through touring and bringing the music to people outside of my own city.  Touring comes with lots of costs and I'm hoping to raise some funds to help me break even.  I'm not looking to make money or even to pay myself while on tour!  This is just to help cover some of the costs of the tour.</p>

<h3><strong>With this campaign I‘m starting a co-creative project that has been a dream for a very long time.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>By bringing incredible artists together from many corners of our wonderful planet, I´d like to experiment with the dimensions of Sound.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>A foundation for this journey will be music that has no particular genre, yet has been influenced by countless travels around the globe, interactions with people from all over, representing all sorts of cultural flavors and backgrounds.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We will begin in a recording studio in Riga, Latvia, with the beautiful name: ‘We Love Sound‘‘. A starting point for a bigger vision to follow and to travel the world with a film and audio equipment capturing the essences our georgeous Planet Earth has to offer.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>For the last 13 years I have been journeying with an instrument that became my spiritual guide and a teacher - a practice that could be more aligned with the concept of guitar yoga than skilled craftmanship.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>All these years I didn‘ t have a home as a physical strucure anywhere, only from time to time I'm stopping by in places to share, to rest and being creative.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>I have played in hundreds of cities, small villages, street corners and concert halls, in front of rich and poor, at festivals and small gatherings. And yet, there is to learn more, so much to let go of, so many roads to explore within.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>In music as well as in life, I have been applying and observing the phenomena of structure (I know) and the uniqueness of improvisation (I dont know). This approach encompasses the foundation and freedom in the same time and is making these opposites inseparable.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We can dream the dream, and very often wait for some other force to come, embrace, recognize or discover our talants. And yet, this recognition first of all starts inside.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Many of us have heard this wonderful expression by Marianne Williamson, I wish to quote it once again as a great reminder to all of us of our unique and infinite beauty:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”</em></strong></p>
<h3><strong>During all these years compositions were formed and are giving birth to ever evolving and expanding ideas. I have never learned how to compose music by sitting in a room, though I’m experiencing it LIVE…</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Every musical short story that comes through me is an interaction with others, feelings, memories, pain and transformation of it all and transcended by sound.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>As an example I would take a piece with the title:</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>""The Song of the Golden Dragon""</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>It came out during intense 6 months of travelling on the roads of Mexico.</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>""All I‘ve had was a guitar, an amp and a car.

<h2><span>Hi my name is Rickey(ThaKiddJopp) I am a young man 24 years of age seeking to Glorify Jesus exalting his name using the gift of rap that he has graciously blessed me with.</span></h2>
<p><span>  This campaign is about reaching the culture through music in my local community and many others places and areas, God Willing. This is very important and special to me personally because during my teenage years I remember the music that I would listen to and how much of a influence it had on me negatively. Through much prayer and confirmation I am fully convinced that God is calling me in this area of ministry. My ultimate aim is  to create music that will point the hearers Closer to Jesus Christ in hopes that The Lord might grant them everlasting life according to his will. </span></p>
<p><span>With your help together we can further the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My music alone is not sufficient enough nor will it convert the listener. The platform of my music is simply to convey the message of the Gospel using my personal experiences as well as scriptures pointing to Jesus and not me. You guys play a important role because your contribution will not only help me reach that Goal financially to be able to create such music but it will also help further the Gospel and advance God's Kingdom.</span></p>
<p>Your help will be greatly appreciated and I can certainly promise you that it will not be in vain. My only hope is that those who stumble across this may either hear the sincerity through what is written or possibly may share the same common passion in wanting to further God's kingdom through music or any other avenue. </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2>For the mixtape and album I need a total amount of $5,000 which includes the cost of Recording, mixing, mastering , duplicated CD's, marketing, promotion and Graphic artwork for album cover.</h2>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>ANY amount is greatly appreicated and never overlooked.</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>$20 Or more</strong> and I will personally send you a thank you video or card as well as a free single from the Project. Thank you so much.</h3>
<h3><strong>$50 or more I will give you the copy of the project before its release date included with a signed copy of the mixtape. Thank You so much.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>$100 or more I will send you a perosnal signed copy of both the album and mixtape and will mention your name in the outro on the album. Thank you so much.</strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>$250 or more you will get all of the above plus I will video chat you personally thanking you! Thank you so much.</strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>$1,000 or more All of the above will be inlcuded and I will come to your local church and do a live show! Thank you so much.</strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>If for some reason we are unable to reach this goal I will use the remaining funds and record as much music as the finances will permit me to and by faith will continue to press forward in Christ believing that he will make provison.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Young teens and young adult's will be presented the Gospel through music in a way that they might have not been acustomed to hearing or in a way that they may have never heard before. My main target is the young, simply because the mainstream media/music has a tight grip on them. However the older are not cancelled out. Praise God if he allows older individuals or mayebe even parents of these young teens to hear the music also. I pray it all points to Christ and is Gospel Centered across the board.</p>
<p>I have made plenty songs but have not been afforded the oppurtunity to relase them to the public due to finances. However i do have a select few of songs/Videos on my ""Youtube"" page. you can check this out by simply going to youtube and searching ""ThaKiddJopp"". A variety of selections will appear. I hope it blessed you.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everyone here plays a very important role even if you are unable to contribute in the are of finances. You can help me out ALOT by sharing the page frequently on all of your social networking sites(Twitter, Facebook, Email and etc).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We all play a important role in this life. Lets use our time wisely and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ through whatever avenue the lord may have for us. Its more than music its about the bigger picture. Eternal Life in Jesus Christ. Thank you all for your time. I appreciate it so Much!</p>

<p><span><strong>Short Summary</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We're Montreal's Diamond Bones, an indie dream-pop trio just about to make our first full-length record! We've been together for a year and have been fortunate enough to play some incredible shows, with amazing bands, in awesome cities. We're finally ready to record the music that we've been working on this whole time; a sound that we've been cultivating into something we're truly proud of and excited for everyone to hear. </span></p>
<p><span>We really want this record to be an honest and genuine expression of us as musicians, songwriters, and as people going through the motions of the every day. Each song has a relationship with the others, which we feel allows the album to be cohesive but also lets each song stand out in its own way. We hope people will enjoy and listen to this record from beginning to end!</span></p>
<p><span>We're so lucky to be working with such a supportive team, including our producer Patrick Krief (The Dears), our co-mixer, Jace Lasek (The Besnard Lakes), and our engineer, James Benjamin (The Breezes), over at the outstanding Breakglass Studios located here in Montreal's Mile End. We're very happy to be executing this project locally with the help of musicians that we so respect and admire. <br/><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The funding received from this campaign will go directly to the <strong>recording, mixing and mastering </strong>of this record. Absolutely any help, big or small, is so important and appreciated. We have the best fans any band could ask for!</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on how much you donate, you can get anything from a personalized thank-you shout out to having your own free private concert! What fun!<br/><br/></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Hey, we understand! We don't have any money either, remember? 'Cause we're doing this!<br/><br/> So any way you can share this campaign with friends, family, strangers, pets - unleash the spammer in you. We know it's in there. Word of mouth is the best way to get people involved! </span></p>
<p><span>A HUGE thank you for your support, we love you. Like, <strong><em>for real</em> love.</strong><br/><br/><br/>Michelle, Isabelle &amp; Lana</span></p>

<p><em><strong> </strong></em><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>I'm an independent singer/songwriter/musician from CT currently working on my third record. Music is not just an important thing to me… it's the one thing I couldn't live without. Music is my heart and soul - it's the core of my being. I can't imagine my life without it, because it's not what I do, it's who I am.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have performed on stages all over theUnited   Statesworking with artists like Natalie Merchant, The Go-Go’s, R.E.O. Speedwagon and Antigone Rising. I have been blessed with a network of family, friends, and fans that support me and my career.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I gain inspiration from everything around me and am beyond excited to share the new songs that I have written for my third CD. The most difficult aspect of being an independent artist is lack of funding. Very early in my recording career I made a commitment to making high quality studio recordings that are comparable with what you would hear on the radio. I am reaching out to as many of my family, friends and fans who would be willing to assist me with finishing this record.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have been working on the CD for over a year and need your financial assistance to finish it… I know together we can make this dream a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>Why $12,000? </strong></em><strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am fortunate enough to collaborate with an award winning producer and professional musicians who have lent their talent to music industry giants. They see something in me and my music and share my excitement about the songs on this CD.  However they don’t work for free… and that’s why I need your help. Major labels can afford to spend at least ten times this much on a record. I've become really good at stretching a dollar, though. $12,000 will not only cover the recording, producing, mixing and mastering of my CD, but will also cover artwork, photos, packaging and CD duplication.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Peter Chung and I am following my dream. I quit my job on January 3rd, 2012 to pursue my lifelong goal of becoming a singer-songwriter and focusing 100% of my time on my original music. Currently my funds have ran out and I need your help.</p>
<p>I have a demo cd that is not bad, but it is what it is: a demo. I believe that my songs are good enough to be placed on TV, in movies, on commercials, for radio play, but the <em>quality</em> of the recordings are not there. A demo cd is great for playing local gigs, but a CD is great for EVERYTHING. </p>
<p>I have been playing open mics and networking in the city of San Francisco for awhile now and I know recording a legitimate CD is my next step.</p>
<p>I know that without my friends and fans I could have never followed my dreams, and without their support I could have never played my music for the public. Please continue to support my dream and I will keep on making music for you, I promise. </p>

<p>I'm JW Corey Tamas, the lead guitarist/singer/composer for a rock band named Dragonfly.</p>
<p>I'm also the producer of our first album, Amplification: a 14-song original rock/jazz/blues/electronica songs which will become a professionally-made digital album. It represents the culmination of hundreds of live shows and decades of songwriting... and it rocks pretty damn hard, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>And now... I need your help to make Amplification a reality.</p>
<p><strong>What Do We Need? What Do You Get?</strong></p>
<p>We're only looking for $4,000, which isn't much as far as this sort of thing goes. $1,412 goes towards the recording  and $2373 goes to the mastering. $280 is Indiegogo's cut of the total, and the remaining $65 will likely go into things like sandwiches and coffee for the band while they're at work. Possibly some breath mints.</p>
<p>We're going to give back as much as we can: Depending on the level of your contribution, you'll get your own copy of Amplification as a digital download (or on a USB drive if you like). But that's far from all: Electronica remixes and acoustic tracks that won't be available otherwise, T-shirts, signed cards and notes to say ""thanks"", and even an album credit as an executive producer. Whatever you contribute, we're gonna give you your money's worth and more. Promise.</p>
<p>If we don't make the goal, funds will cover as much of the recording and mastering fees as possible, but may result in a delay or cancelation of the project. Boo hiss.</p>
<p><strong>Why Make Amplification?</strong></p>
<p>The reason why this album matters became clear one night when I was talking with (drummer/composer) Aaron Ferrera about what I should do with the body of musical work I'd created. At the time I was unsure about pursuing an album project, and he responded to me simply: ""Nobody else is doing music like this.""</p>
<p>And he's right. The fusion of hard rock with jazz and blues and electronica with lyrics about spirit and philosophy break out of the radio-friendly zone in a big way. This world needs music that tries to do something new.</p>
<p>Though the scale of the project is daunting, I'm no stranger to independent album releases: I did two releases under my own name that paid for themselves in full, and I've been deeply involved in digital music recording and performance for over a decade. While Amplification is a big project compared to past efforts, it falls neatly into the range of my skill set and experience. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone can contribute cash to a project like this, but if you want to support Amplification and help get this album made, you can get the word out and make a lot of noise. </p>
<p>There's a long list of great things you can do to help us out: Post our campaign URL (<a href=""http://indiegogo.com/amplification"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://indiegogo.com/amplification</a>) or the Dragonfly website (<a href=""http://dragonfly-live.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dragonfly-live.com</a>) on your Facebook page, Blog, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+ or whatever you happen to be grooving on.

<h3>My Story</h3> If you got this then you know me personally,impersonally or have heard me play...So I've been dragging my feet and have gotten it together to record songs I've been working on for several years. I've tried to record some of these on my own but with poor results.

 this won't happen for free. I have to raise money to record this e.p. 
Would you like to participate in helping me make this record?<br/>
I'm doing my fundraising on indiegogo. here below; give it a glance and watch a small video I made.<br/><br/>Here's a bit about me;<br/><br/><br/>

Christian Carbat Carana... thought for a moment to have been the 
nephew of Philip strauss kahn has in fact no other relation other than 
being part French...CC Carana was born in 1972 in a sort of Basket in 
France..<br/>


Visited by a chimp while still in that basket, the chimp was chased 
away... That same year, a very young Carana was introduced to Jazz by the clarinetist Mezz Mezzrow in Paris, although not directly since he died the year of Carana's birth....Direct re-incarnation? According to Carana's mother, she had Mezzrow's  drums in her basement... ??Maybe he dabbled in drums too...Carana's Mother later sold this rare drum set to an obscure British new
 wave producer...Twelve years later Carana relocated to NEW York where 
he grew dreadlocks and wanted to be a Rastafarian. He did not want to be
 a white man. It was around this time that he discovered his roots in 
Guadeloupe as well as more recently in Haiti. Carana also traveled 
extensively to Jamaica and later met up with Ras Michael In Los 
Angleles a few months prior to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In 1994 He 
got yelled at in a now defunct New York city reggae record shop by the late Singer 
Joseph Hill for his ignorance. Joseph Hill who had been the founder of 
the legendary group <b>Culture</b>,lost his temper at the young Carana 
for not knowing he had toured throughout Africa for many years. Later that year, Carana recorded his first solo record onto cassette entitled; me, myself and
 I./ Lonesome rider... The origins of this music might be akin to folk... To this day, CC 
Carana plays a form of flock music...Flak , Folk, Flock...whatever...<br/><br/>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<div>
<strong>DC²</strong> </div>
<p>We believe that each of us is here to pursue the things we dream of and long for, but that often it is hard to find support or encouragement in our modern world. We hope that if we pursue our dreams, and share every step of that journey with all of you, maybe we can inspire you to follow your own. And maybe we can all make the world a little bit better.<br/><br/> We are 3 friends, reunited by our love for music, taking a journey towards the dream we share.<br/><br/> We went to high school together, and it was then, that we started playing music as a group.<br/><br/>David, Chris and Chris. Our real names became our musical identity: DC²<br/><br/> Our bond. The chemistry created through playing guitar together.<br/><br/> Our goal. Create our music and share it with you.<br/><br/> Our purpose. To follow our hearts and show you that you can too.<br/><br/> We invite you to come along and be part of this adventure, to inspire you to follow your own dreams.</p>
<p>  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<div>
<em>We are creating an album.</em><br/><br/>Currently, we are all scattered around the world. One of us lives in Mexico (David), the other one in Dubai (Chris Tombrink) and the other in Singapore (Chris Thyssen).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, our bond for playing guitar together, has helped us come to the decision, to reunite and make something that will stay with us for the rest of our lives.<br/><br/>The variety and richness of opportunity available to people today, is enabling each of us to tell our stories in the way that comes most naturally to us. We have decided to make something that will not only be an audible experience, but a written and visual one as well.<br/><br/>We hope that by combining these different means of storytelling, we can take you on this journey, and you can be a part of writing this story with us.<br/><br/>Our adventure will take place in Mexico, traveling from Cancun to Tepoztlan, starting June 20th, 2012.<br/><br/>With 12 general locations to discover, over a 2,000km travel route, there's bound to be unexpected experiences and challenges along the way.<br/><br/>We want to involve you in our journey in the hopes of inspiring you to follow your own path, wherever that may lead.<br/><br/>We’ve decided to do this the only way that comes naturally to us, and that is by inviting you to be a part of what we hope may be the beginning of the rest of our lives. And maybe the path we take will help you to find your own, and walk the road less taken, towards everything you imagine.</div>

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<div>The album we want to create is one that will involve you, from day 1 of the journey, till its post-production and release of the final material. In order for you to be able to follow us from beginning to end, we will need a few things that will allow you keep track of us:</div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>1. Social Media Pages.</strong></h3>
<p>  - Facebook: The main page for interactive involvement. You will be able to view our timeline, from the founding of DC² beginning of 2007, up until now and everything else that is still to come, including videos of our past performances and a full library of pictures. And of course we will keep you updated on what we are doing at all times, as well as how you will be able to help us.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/DavidChrisChris"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/DavidChrisChris</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>  - Tumblr: This is the core of everything to come. tumblr is where we will create the new story from now, until the end of our journey, this is our personal online diary. Everything that is created here will also be linked to all our other pages, but if you want the real detail of everything we have to say and show, you come to us here.</p>
<p><a href=""http://davidchrischris.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://davidchrischris.tumblr.com</a></p>
<p><br/>   - Twitter: Here you can quickly follow what we are doing, and what our next steps are going to be. We will mainly use twitter as well during the actual adventure in Mexico, to keep you updated with short messages, in places where communication is limited.</p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/DC2Adv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/DC2Adv</a></p>
<p><br/>   - Vimeo and YouTube: Our video channels.</p>

<p><strong>Sub-Total: Free</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2. <strong>3G &amp; </strong>Geo-tracking.</strong></h3>
<p><strong></strong>This will enable us to update you in the moment, whilst in Mexico. We want to be able to tell you in real time, where we are, what we are doing, and what we are going to do, as well as the decisions we will need you to make as a crowd.<br/><br/>Of course in order for us to be able to share our experience in this way, we will need a device that is capable of doing all of this. A smartphone being the obvious choice, will help us setup our tracking and sharing system, so that we can be continuously in contact with you, wherever we are.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-Total: $500</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>3. Recording Equipment.</strong></h3>
<p>In order for us to be able to record on the move, everywhere we go, and give you the best audible experience possible, we will need a few instruments to help us make this possible.</p>
<p>Since we are going to be recording in outdoor remote areas such as caves, forests, mountains and other interesting places, we are going to need a light, portable and quality recording rig.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-Total: $1,800 </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>4. Cinematography &amp; Photography Equipment.</strong></h3>
<p>The visual aspect of the adventure is also just as important to us as the actual recording of the audio. They both play huge roles in being able to produce the most genuine recreation of this road trip.<br/><br/>This, just like the audio equipment has its specific needs in order to be able to withstand the kind of places we will be visiting and at the same time produce the quality we require.</p>
<p><strong>Sub-Total: $5,900</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>5. Travel Equipment.</strong></h3>
<p>We will need certain equipment in order for us to cope with non-industrialized areas, especially when we are recording, filming or out camping in the wild. This way we can keep our instruments running even if we do not have any power available once they have run out.<br/><br/>We will also need a few things for ourselves, like sleeping gear, travel gear, and protective gear for us as well as our equipment, so that nothing gets damaged, and well, so we can keep ourselves out of harms way.</p>
<p><strong><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.743966814596206""></strong>Sub-Total: $1,300</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>6. Miscellaneous Items.</strong></h3>
<p>Other items will also be required in order for the trip to go smoothly, that way we will not risk delaying the adventure with possible problems that can be easily avoided.<br/><br/>Things like fuel, spare tires, plane tickets and traveling through toll gates are all things we need to take into account, to make the trip more feasible.</p>

Not only does it help us share our ideas to all of you, but it also lets us get in contact with everyone that shares what we believe in.<br/><br/>Unfortunately not everyone is able to take advantage of such an opportunity.<br/><br/>One of our final stops on the adventure will be in Cuernavaca, near the town of Tepoztlan, where we will spend the day with a foundation for children without parents.  Many of them have lost a big part of their childhood, due to a clouded past and the emotional scars they hold.  <br/><br/>We want to help them find and ignite their own passion, and hopefully motivate them to follow their own dreams and live a fulfilling life.  <br/><br/>They will be the first ones to hear our music live and we are going to have them participate in one of our songs, in order to bring light and awareness to the matter.<br/><br/>Additionally, we are going to be doing a fundraiser for them during our trip.  More information on how you can help these children will be revealed as we get closer to the start of our adventure.</p>

Our Story

DC² 
We believe that each of us is here to pursue the things we dream of and long for, but that often it is hard to find support or encouragement in our modern world. We hope that if we pursue our dreams, and share every step of that journey with all of you, maybe we can inspire you to follow your own. And maybe we can all make the world a little bit better. We are 3 friends, reunited by our love for music, taking a journey towards the dream we share. We went to high school together, and it was then, that we started playing music as a group.David, Chris and Chris. Our real names became our musical identity: DC² Our bond. The chemistry created through playing guitar together. Our goal. Create our music and share it with you. Our purpose. To follow our hearts and show you that you can too. We invite you to come along and be part of this adventure, to inspire you to follow your own dreams.
  


The Impact

We are creating an album.Currently, we are all scattered around the world. One of us lives in Mexico (David), the other one in Dubai (Chris Tombrink) and the other in Singapore (Chris Thyssen).Nevertheless, our bond for playing guitar together, has helped us come to the decision, to reunite and make something that will stay with us for the rest of our lives.The variety and richness of opportunity available to people today, is enabling each of us to tell our stories in the way that comes most naturally to us. We have decided to make something that will not only be an audible experience, but a written and visual one as well.We hope that by combining these different means of storytelling, we can take you on this journey, and you can be a part of writing this story with us.Our adventure will take place in Mexico, traveling from Cancun to Tepoztlan, starting June 20th, 2012.With 12 general locations to discover, over a 2,000km travel route, there's bound to be unexpected experiences and challenges along the way.We want to involve you in our journey in the hopes of inspiring you to follow your own path, wherever that may lead.We’ve decided to do this the only way that comes naturally to us, and that is by inviting you to be a part of what we hope may be the beginning of the rest of our lives. And maybe the path we take will help you to find your own, and walk the road less taken, towards everything you imagine.

 


What We Need & What You Get
The album we want to create is one that will involve you, from day 1 of the journey, till its post-production and release of the final material. In order for you to be able to follow us from beginning to end, we will need a few things that will allow you keep track of us:
 
1. Social Media Pages.
  - Facebook: The main page for interactive involvement. You will be able to view our timeline, from the founding of DC² beginning of 2007, up until now and everything else that is still to come, including videos of our past performances and a full library of pictures. And of course we will keep you updated on what we are doing at all times, as well as how you will be able to help us.
http://www.facebook.com/DavidChrisChris
 
  - Tumblr: This is the core of everything to come. tumblr is where we will create the new story from now, until the end of our journey, this is our personal online diary. Everything that is created here will also be linked to all our other pages, but if you want the real detail of everything we have to say and show, you come to us here.
http://davidchrischris.tumblr.com
   - Twitter: Here you can quickly follow what we are doing, and what our next steps are going to be. We will mainly use twitter as well during the actual adventure in Mexico, to keep you updated with short messages, in places where communication is limited.

   - Vimeo and YouTube: Our video channels.

Sub-Total: Free 
 
 
2. 3G & Geo-tracking.
This will enable us to update you in the moment, whilst in Mexico. We want to be able to tell you in real time, where we are, what we are doing, and what we are going to do, as well as the decisions we will need you to make as a crowd.Of course in order for us to be able to share our experience in this way, we will need a device that is capable of doing all of this. A smartphone being the obvious choice, will help us setup our tracking and sharing system, so that we can be continuously in contact with you, wherever we are.
Sub-Total: $500
 
 
3. Recording Equipment.
In order for us to be able to record on the move, everywhere we go, and give you the best audible experience possible, we will need a few instruments to help us make this possible.
Since we are going to be recording in outdoor remote areas such as caves, forests, mountains and other interesting places, we are going to need a light, portable and quality recording rig.
Sub-Total: $1,800 
 
 
4. Cinematography & Photography Equipment.
The visual aspect of the adventure is also just as important to us as the actual recording of the audio. They both play huge roles in being able to produce the most genuine recreation of this road trip.This, just like the audio equipment has its specific needs in order to be able to withstand the kind of places we will be visiting and at the same time produce the quality we require.
Sub-Total: $5,900
 
 
5. Travel Equipment.
We will need certain equipment in order for us to cope with non-industrialized areas, especially when we are recording, filming or out camping in the wild. This way we can keep our instruments running even if we do not have any power available once they have run out.We will also need a few things for ourselves, like sleeping gear, travel gear, and protective gear for us as well as our equipment, so that nothing gets damaged, and well, so we can keep ourselves out of harms way.
Sub-Total: $1,300
 
 
6. Miscellaneous Items.
Other items will also be required in order for the trip to go smoothly, that way we will not risk delaying the adventure with possible problems that can be easily avoided.Things like fuel, spare tires, plane tickets and traveling through toll gates are all things we need to take into account, to make the trip more feasible.
Sub-Total: $7,500

We will still try and release everything that we can with what we have.Of course if we do reach our target, it will help us assure you that our full production will be released, and that we can give the most authentic recreation of this beautiful adventure we hope to share with you.Through being able to fulfill this journey, we will finally be able to share with you our finished recordings of the story you helped create.

Una Parada De Importancia
El mundo digital ofrece una nueva manera para que nos comuniquemos a una escala global. No sólo nos ayuda a compartir nuestras ideas con todos ustedes, sino que también nos permite entrar en contacto con todo el mundo que comparte lo que creemos.Desafortunadamente no todo el mundo es capaz de tomar ventaja de esta oportunidad.Una de nuestras paradas finales en la aventura será en Cuernavaca, cerca de Tepoztlán, donde pasaremos el día con una fundación para niños sin padres. Muchos de ellos han perdido una gran parte de su infancia, debido a un pasado turbio y las cicatrices emocionales que poseen.Queremos ayudarles a encontrar y encender su propia pasión, y esperamos motivarlos a seguir sus propios sueños y vivir una vida plena.Ellos serán los primeros en escuchar nuestra música en vivo y queremos que participen en una de nuestras canciones, para llevar a luz a la materia.Además, vamos a juntar fondos para ellos durante nuestro viaje. Más información sobre cómo podrán ayudar a estos niños será revelada conforme nos acerquemos al inicio de nuestra aventura.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Six months ago Vak Choir Director and professional vocalist<strong><a href=""http://www.anndyer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Ann Dyer </a></strong>was commissioned by the YBCA<strong> </strong>to create a full-length concert inspired by her many years of exploration of ancient Indian sound practices. Ann titled the new work <strong><a href=""http://www.songofbecoming.org/project-description.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vak: Song of Becoming</a>, </strong>and decided to build it on an enormous, sonorous foundation of vocal resonance.</p>
<p><strong>And so the Vak Choir was born.</strong> 108+ ""everyday"" voices exploring how voice and deep listening can awaken us to different dimensions of awareness. We have quickly grown to over 150 choir members, people now passionate about their new connection to sound and self, and eager to ""share the love"" in performance this fall at the YBCA.</p>
<p>Vak does, indeed, seem to have a mighty momentum all her own. What began as a concert, quickly became a choir, and is now The Vak Project, with plans destined to outlive our premiere at the YBCA, including future performances and educational outreach programs that inspire and awaken through voice and listening.</p>

THE NEED 


The YBCA has given us a generous commission to launch this project. But concert production in a state-of-the-art union facility costs more than a song. We need your help to raise the additional funds to support the artistic and healing goals of the program. Your contributions will go toward:
• summer rehearsal space large enough to accommodate over 100 people. 
• technical support for this production which requires the finest sound engineering.
• public programs in ""sound and self"" offerred free to the public this summer.
• artist wages for our incredibly talented Bay Area based artists.

<h3>We are about to ask you for money. </h3>
<p>Indulge me and try to imagine us sitting opposite from you and delivering this hum-dinger of a sales pitch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! </p>
<p>How are you? We're doing great, but we're pretty broke. That's why we need your help!</p>
<p>We have a new record to make, but we're pretty much cat food status poor. To make matters worse, there's only two of us, so cost per person is pretty high.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Tracking a record costs $35 per hour or about $350 per day. For five songs it costs about $1750 just to track. That doesn't include mixing, and that doesn't include pressing. Our last records cost about $2000 each without pressing.</p>
<p>So what it comes down to is us asking (begging) for help. </p>
<p>When you construct one of these pages you really realize what your figure means. It's terrifying, and a whole world of possibilities like ""what if we're asking too much,"" and ""what if no one donates at all"" run through your head. We've set a goal of $1500 because $1500 is what we need. We wouldn't feel right asking friends and fans to pay our entire way. It's ambitious, and we hope that we can raise anything close to it. Every small contribution helps, and that is no joke.  </p>

Tracking a record costs $35 per hour or about $350 per day. For five songs it costs about $1750 just to track. That doesn't include mixing, and that doesn't include pressing. Our last records cost about $2000 each without pressing.
So what it comes down to is us asking (begging) for help. 
When you construct one of these pages you really realize what your figure means. It's terrifying, and a whole world of possibilities like ""what if we're asking too much,"" and ""what if no one donates at all"" run through your head. We've set a goal of $1500 because $1500 is what we need. We wouldn't feel right asking friends and fans to pay our entire way. It's ambitious, and we hope that we can raise anything close to it. Every small contribution helps, and that is no joke.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>présentation
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>En réunissant de nombreux musiciens de jazz et d'avant garde, <i>Healing 
Orchestra</i> est conçu comme un forum permettant de faire vivre une musique
 forte et généreuse, ancrée dans la grande tradition du free jazz et de 
la Great Black Music . Dans la lignée du workshop de Charles Mingus, du 
Little Huey Orchestra de William Parker, ou encore du Akosh S Unit, 
l’orchestre réussit la symbiose entre une 
écriture fine et l’improvisation libre, entre le free jazz et les 
musiques traditionnelles. </p>
<p>Healing
 Orchestra s’approprie une philosophie et les idées suivantes : La 
liberté totale dans l’usage des techniques de jeu, d’écriture, 
d’improvisation, au service de la musique. Un son collectif vivant et 
organique, construit par les initiatives et personnalités de chaque 
individu. Enfin une vision de la musique, de l’art et de la culture 
,au-delà des querelles entre avant-garde et tradition, qui lui 
donne avant tout une ambition sociale, émancipatrice et forcément 
révolutionnaire.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cette musique a murit pendant de nombreuses années grâce à l’énergie, aux idées, à la générosité d’un
très grand nombre de musiciens qui l’ont joué, exploré, développé ensemble, Le
plus souvent dans des conditions matérielles très limitées. C’est une œuvre
collective et engagée, dans la musique, dans le temps, et je l’espère porteuse
d’une révolte créatrice et pleine d’enthousiasme.</p>
<p><b>Ce long et patient travail a permis à cette 
formation de se hisser au rang des grands orchestres de Free jazz et de 
musiques créatives. Votre contribution permettra d'aider à la diffusion 
de cette musique, qui mêle une écriture généreuse à l'énergie 
d'interprètes et d'improvisateurs aux belles personnalités,  et pensée 
pour être partagée avec tous.</b></p>

présentation


En réunissant de nombreux musiciens de jazz et d'avant garde, Healing 
Orchestra est conçu comme un forum permettant de faire vivre une musique
 forte et généreuse, ancrée dans la grande tradition du free jazz et de 
la Great Black Music . Dans la lignée du workshop de Charles Mingus, du 
Little Huey Orchestra de William Parker, ou encore du Akosh S Unit, 
l’orchestre réussit la symbiose entre une 
écriture fine et l’improvisation libre, entre le free jazz et les 
musiques traditionnelles. 
Healing
 Orchestra s’approprie une philosophie et les idées suivantes : La 
liberté totale dans l’usage des techniques de jeu, d’écriture, 
d’improvisation, au service de la musique. Un son collectif vivant et 
organique, construit par les initiatives et personnalités de chaque 
individu. Enfin une vision de la musique, de l’art et de la culture 
,au-delà des querelles entre avant-garde et tradition, qui lui 
donne avant tout une ambition sociale, émancipatrice et forcément 
révolutionnaire.

Cette musique a murit pendant de nombreuses années grâce à l’énergie, aux idées, à la générosité d’un
très grand nombre de musiciens qui l’ont joué, exploré, développé ensemble, Le
plus souvent dans des conditions matérielles très limitées. C’est une œuvre
collective et engagée, dans la musique, dans le temps, et je l’espère porteuse
d’une révolte créatrice et pleine d’enthousiasme.
Ce long et patient travail a permis à cette 
formation de se hisser au rang des grands orchestres de Free jazz et de 
musiques créatives. Votre contribution permettra d'aider à la diffusion 
de cette musique, qui mêle une écriture généreuse à l'énergie 
d'interprètes et d'improvisateurs aux belles personnalités,  et pensée 
pour être partagée avec tous.



L'aide que nous sollicitons

Après l'enregistrement de ce premier album, en janvier 2015, nous demandons une aide de 2000 euros pour sa conception et sa fabrication.
We Need 2000 euros to pay the making of our first Album. Extra contributions are welcome as they will help us to reimburse the price of the recording.
Si nous récoltons plus de 2000 euros, les dons en excès nous permettront de rétribuer les nombreuses personnes qui offrent de leur temps et de leur talent pour la conception de l'album, et éventuellement de nous rembourser les sommes avancées lors de l'enregistrement.

Chaque contributeur, quelque soit le montant de son aide,  recevra un exemplaire de notre disque dés sa sortie.

<strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wer ist eigentlich BENHAMMER?</strong><p>Hallo, das bin ich. Ihr kennt mich vielleicht aus der deutschen Internet-und-Fotoszene, wo ich seit 2010 als Blogger und Fotograf aktiv bin. Vielleicht habt ihr schon einmal was von mir gelesen oder gesehen – vielleicht aber auch nicht. In den letzten 6 Jahren habe ich unzählige Fotografen kennenlernen dürfen, viele Fotografen auf meinem Blog mit ihrer Arbeit vorgestellt und selber den Weg in die Fotografie gefunden. Jetzt will ich mein erstes eigenes Buch machen. Über meine Leidenschaft zur Fotografie  und meine ganz persönliche Sicht auf meine Mitmenschen.</p>
<p><u>Und genau dafür brauche ich jetzt Eure Hilfe!</u></p>
<p>Hier findet ihr ein paar Interviews aus den letzten Jahren, die vielleicht noch ein bisschen mehr über mich und meine Arbeit erzählen. Wenn ihr mögt, lest gerne rein. </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Wie ihr mir helfen könnt?</strong></p>
<p>Ganz einfach. Ich brauche Euer Geld, damit ich dieses Buch produzieren kann. SO, wie ich es mir vorstelle und ohne Kompromisse. Dafür brauche ich nach Absprache mit Layouter und Druckerei ca. <strong>8700 Euro</strong>. Außerdem nehmen sich Steuern, Indiegogo und Paypal natürlich noch ein bisschen vom Kuchen. Je mehr Geld wir hier zusammensammeln, desto schöner und exklusiver werden wir dieses kleine Herzensprojekt gestalten und es zu etwas besonderem für jeden von Euch machen.</p>
<p>Und deswegen brauche ich Euer Geld. Aber ich will es nicht geschenkt haben! Nein, ich will, dass ihr versteht, warum mir dieses Buch so wichtig ist und ihr in meine Welt der Fotografie eintaucht, um danach Eure eigene Arbeit vielleicht aus einer ganz neuen Perspektive zusehen. Darum habe ich mir unzählige PERKs ausgedacht, die hoffentlich für jeden von Euch irgendeinen kleinen oder großen Mehrwert. <strong>Ganz wichtig: </strong>Sollte dieses Funding aus irgendeinem Grund nicht funktionieren – was ich natürlich nicht hoffe, weil ich irgendwie auf Euch setze – bekommt ihr alle die Kohle von Indiegogo wieder!</p> </div><p><strong>Und was ist ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER"" jetzt?</strong></p><p>2016 war das bisher verrückteste Jahr meines Lebens. Höhenflüge und Rückschläge folgten Woche für Woche. Vom Gründen meines eigenen Studios hier in Köln bis zur ersten Internet-Offtime in meinem bisher 25-jährigen Leben. Bis zum Rückzug in meine ländliche Heimat war alles dabei. Schon seit Beginn des Jahres quälte mich die Unzufriedenheit mit meiner eigenen Arbeit. Ich kaufte mir über Kleinanzeigen eine Olympus Mju II auf Empfehlung von geschätzten Kollegen und begann mich mit den alten Analogkameras meines verstobenen Opas zu beschäftigen. Die Mju und ein Haufen Analogfilme wurden zum ständigen Begleiter und inzwischen habe ich fast 200 Filme in diesem Jahr mit ihr gefüllt. Es sind Momentaufnahmen von Menschen, die dieses Jahr meinen Weg kreuzten.Vom ganz normalen Wahnsinn des Alltags bis zum selbstzerstörerischen Überkonsum von Alkohol und anderen Drogen.

</div></div>","Wer ist eigentlich BENHAMMER?Hallo, das bin ich. Ihr kennt mich vielleicht aus der deutschen Internet-und-Fotoszene, wo ich seit 2010 als Blogger und Fotograf aktiv bin. Vielleicht habt ihr schon einmal was von mir gelesen oder gesehen – vielleicht aber auch nicht. In den letzten 6 Jahren habe ich unzählige Fotografen kennenlernen dürfen, viele Fotografen auf meinem Blog mit ihrer Arbeit vorgestellt und selber den Weg in die Fotografie gefunden. Jetzt will ich mein erstes eigenes Buch machen. Über meine Leidenschaft zur Fotografie  und meine ganz persönliche Sicht auf meine Mitmenschen.
Und genau dafür brauche ich jetzt Eure Hilfe!
Hier findet ihr ein paar Interviews aus den letzten Jahren, die vielleicht noch ein bisschen mehr über mich und meine Arbeit erzählen. Wenn ihr mögt, lest gerne rein. 

Interview mit Spielfeld-Berlin
Interview mit Thang von Electru
Interview mit Compagnon
Feature auf Designlovr

Wie ihr mir helfen könnt?
Ganz einfach. Ich brauche Euer Geld, damit ich dieses Buch produzieren kann. SO, wie ich es mir vorstelle und ohne Kompromisse. Dafür brauche ich nach Absprache mit Layouter und Druckerei ca. 8700 Euro. Außerdem nehmen sich Steuern, Indiegogo und Paypal natürlich noch ein bisschen vom Kuchen. Je mehr Geld wir hier zusammensammeln, desto schöner und exklusiver werden wir dieses kleine Herzensprojekt gestalten und es zu etwas besonderem für jeden von Euch machen.
Und deswegen brauche ich Euer Geld. Aber ich will es nicht geschenkt haben! Nein, ich will, dass ihr versteht, warum mir dieses Buch so wichtig ist und ihr in meine Welt der Fotografie eintaucht, um danach Eure eigene Arbeit vielleicht aus einer ganz neuen Perspektive zusehen. Darum habe ich mir unzählige PERKs ausgedacht, die hoffentlich für jeden von Euch irgendeinen kleinen oder großen Mehrwert. Ganz wichtig: Sollte dieses Funding aus irgendeinem Grund nicht funktionieren – was ich natürlich nicht hoffe, weil ich irgendwie auf Euch setze – bekommt ihr alle die Kohle von Indiegogo wieder! Und was ist ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER"" jetzt?2016 war das bisher verrückteste Jahr meines Lebens. Höhenflüge und Rückschläge folgten Woche für Woche. Vom Gründen meines eigenen Studios hier in Köln bis zur ersten Internet-Offtime in meinem bisher 25-jährigen Leben. Bis zum Rückzug in meine ländliche Heimat war alles dabei. Schon seit Beginn des Jahres quälte mich die Unzufriedenheit mit meiner eigenen Arbeit. Ich kaufte mir über Kleinanzeigen eine Olympus Mju II auf Empfehlung von geschätzten Kollegen und begann mich mit den alten Analogkameras meines verstobenen Opas zu beschäftigen. Die Mju und ein Haufen Analogfilme wurden zum ständigen Begleiter und inzwischen habe ich fast 200 Filme in diesem Jahr mit ihr gefüllt. Es sind Momentaufnahmen von Menschen, die dieses Jahr meinen Weg kreuzten.Vom ganz normalen Wahnsinn des Alltags bis zum selbstzerstörerischen Überkonsum von Alkohol und anderen Drogen. All das aufgenommen mit dieser kleinen Kamera. Zusammen mit der kompromisslosen Zerstörung meines ehemaligen Weblogs von jetzt auf gleich ist der Titel ""DAS LEBEN UND STERBEN DES BENHAMMER"" entstanden.Es war meine ganz eigene Therapie mich persönlich wieder vom Onlinehype und Instagramfluten zu befreien, die die letzten 6 Jahre meines Lebens ohne Pause geprägt haben.  Stattdessen habe ich versucht einen neuen Blick auf die Fotografie zu finden und wieder mehr Zeit mit den Menschen und der Art von visueller Dokumentation zu verbringen, die mich einst so sehr fasziniert hat.  Was du gibst & was du bekommst 
Also ich brauche für den Druck in schöner Magazinoptik mit hochwertigem Cover ziemlich genau 7500,00 Euro dazu kommen die PAYPAL und INDIEGOGO Kosten
Wenn wir also mehr als die veranschlagten 8700,00 Euro zusammenbekommen, würde ich wahlweise die Seitenstärke erhöhen oder noch geileres Papier wählen.
Bei 9000,00 Euro würde ich an einem Sonderdruck arbeiten, um die ganze Haptik noch einmal auf ein neues Level zu heben

>9000,00 Euro sprengt gerade meine Vorstellungskraft, aber ich könnte mir limitierte Siebdruck-Poster für alle Supporter hier vorstellen oder aber auch eine exklusive Verpackung. Don't know. Let me know! 

In der eigenen Facebook-Gruppe und hier in der Historie halte ich Euch übrigens jederzeit auf dem Laufenden über das Projekt. Eigentlich ist alles aber so gut durchgeplant, dass es gar keine Risiken geben kann.
Und so sieht der Plan aus...
Da ich bekanntlich Optimist bin, auch wenn ich meine Zweifel nie so ganz verbergen kann, erzähle ich Euch einfach jetzt schon vom Plan. 
Bis zum 31.12 fotografiere ich noch mit meiner Olympus Mju II weiter mein 2016. 
Im Januar gebe ich die letzten Filme in die Entwicklung bei Foto Lambertin am Dom (die entwickeln nämlich in 24h)
Danach geht's zu Marcus die letzten Filme digitalisieren.
Dann drucke ich die letzten Bilder auch noch aus und werde alle Bilder final mit Sebastian und Felix kuratieren, sodass ich Anfang Februar mit dem Inhalt fertig bin
Im Februar werden wir dann das Layout setzen und ich werde meine Texte und Fußnoten zum Buch verfassen
Im März gehen wir dann in den Druck
Am 14. April 2017 erscheint ""THE LIFE AND DEATH OF BENHAMMER""
Alle von Euch, die hier supportet haben, sollen es schon am 13. April im Briefkasten haben
Die Releaseparty findet entweder am 13. April statt oder in der Woche nach dem 14. April. Daran arbeite ich gerade noch. 

 
Als kleine Einstimmung auf die Releaseparty gibt's hier noch mein bisheriges Lieblingsausstellungsvideo vom guten Kristof. Ihr dürft Euch also freuen! Ich glaube zusammen mit Euch könnte das Ding echt ziemlich gut werden!
  
Jetzt noch eine Preview? Klar!

<h3>What Going On?</h3>
<p>Ben Asbury here, I record music under the moniker <i>Axxa/Abraxas.</i> Back in 2014 I released my debut LP through Brooklyn label <i>Captured Tracks</i> after releasing a handful of short run cassette releases. Over the last three years I have continued to write and record music but for a variety of reasons I have been unable to see the release of a sophomore effort. Thanks to a success through this indiegogo, my new album '<i>Family Altar' </i>will see a proper vinyl release in Spring 2017!</p>
<p>""<i>Family Altar"" </i>was recorded in various homes between summer 2015 and spring 2016 on a tascam 4 track.  Its warm, homey, lo-fi sound recalls the early <i>Axxa/Abraxas</i> cassette releases that were rerecorded for 2014's self-title LP, however this record is a substantial sonic improvement over those early recordings.  This album provides a bridge between the psych-pop songs found on the last LP and the more psyched out, krauty jammers that I've begun recording for the album to follow.  Recording this album was a healing process for me after I finally moved back into a normal housing situation after living between my van/a storage unit/ on friends &amp; family's couches.  I was dealing with a lot of mental stress and anxiety.  This album helped me to come to terms with and reconcile some of my own mental traps and it stresses working to find balance in life. The idea of a family altar runs along with a concept of building a chapel for your duties, to build a sacred place around you where you can go into each situation and complete each action with sense of awe and wonder.  I am extremely excited to present this album to all of you!</p>
<p>To hear the first single from ""<i>Family Altar,"" ""White Ship Pt. 1"" </i>as well as it's companion piece, please visit: <a href=""http://www.axxaabraxas.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.axxaabraxas.tumblr.com</a></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal set for this campaign is $2,200 however to do a deluxe treatment of this pressing is going to run me more along the lines of $3,000.  This includes purple vinyl housed in a full color proprinted inner sleeve inside a silkscreened and die-cut Jacket, as well as a silkscreened posted, hand numbered and limited to the folks who contribute through the indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>This campaign is mostly just a preorder for the new album but there are also some extra special incentives including out of print Axxa releases, original artwork, and special limited releases.</p>
<p>At the $45 contribution level you can be a part of the ""Lost Tracks"" 3xCS subscription series, you will receive a new tape of unreleased Axxa music every month or two leading up to the release of ""<i>Family Altar"" (only 20 available).</i>  At $50 get you an original silkscreen piece from the series that was used to design the art on 2014s ""<i>Axxa/Abraxas"" (your choice, but first come first serve since there are only a handful of each. Link: <a href=""http://nofuturenow.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://nofuturenow.tumblr.com</a> )</i>. $75 gets you the LP AND a test press of the LP courtesy of United Record Pressings! The $100 incentive called ""<i>From the Archive""</i> is limited to ONE and it includes the entire <i>Axxa/Abraxas </i>AND <i>AX </i>discography. This includes the ABSOLUTE last copy of at lease 3 or 4 releases. $100 can also get you a ""Family Altar"" LP plus a hand painted 10"" (78rpm) record made in a series limited to the number of people that claim this incentive.  For $250 you get the album plus and original art piece created just for you. At $350 you receive an LP plus a tapestry piece that includes all 26 of the silkscreen pieces in the series used to design the art of <i>'Axxa/Abraxas.' </i>There are three of these total, I have one, Mike Sniper at <i>Captured Tracks</i> has one, and this last one that you could own was used as a window display at Wuxtry Records in Athens, GA.  Finally, for $500, you can get credited on the album as 'Exective Producer,' also includes an LP, a test pressing, and guest list passes to every <i>Axxa/Abraxas</i> show forever. Please contact me with any Questions/Comments/Concerns and we can work something out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that money is tight.  I spent the better part of the months leading up to recording this album without a job or a stable living situation.  However with a campaign like this it is extremely important to get the word out at to as many people as possible.  There are links on this page that can be used to share this page on yr favorite social media outlets and I would GREATLY appreciate if y'all use them, whether you can contribute monetarily or not.  </p>

<p>This record was born out of a dream-long pilgrimage: through the fields of Iowa to the banks of the Mississippi. Over the sea to walk across countries. Sleeping in dimly lit hostels with new friends from all over the globe. Sitting in living rooms watching <i>Cosmos. </i>Slaying old monsters that you were told would devour you if you didn't live a certain way. Spilling your guts with loved ones in city apartments. Internet dating schemes gone awry. Driving through the Tobacco Roots with your dad. Stealing riffs from your favorite bands. Searching for some internal release only to be given a different answer. Finding yourself grasping and then being reminded to let go. This is <i>Tom Hymn's Tangerine Dream.</i></p>

Then moving to an old out-of-use church in the peak of a Grand Rapids summer, and recording vocals in a sweaty un-AC'd confessional booth. Hitting 'record' only between firework explosions and poltergeist hijinx. Then moving into multiple other garages, bedrooms, and parlors to end up sitting with Jacob, holding his newborn baby, in the mixing booth (a screened-in porch) and finishing <i>THTD.</i></p>

</div><p></p><p>Hi there, thanks for taking the time to look at our crowdfunding page!</p><p><b>Who we are:</b></p><p>We’re Tannara: From Orkney Owen Sinclair (Guitar/Vocals), Stonehaven- Cameron Ross (Fiddle/Vocals), Achiltibuie- Joseph Peach (Accordion) and Becca Skeoch (Clarsach) from Fort Augustus. </p><p>We’ve been playing together as Tannara for just over a year now. We’ve had a totally fantastic time arranging and writing music together and we’ve been really lucky to share this with people at some brilliant venues and festivals.</p><p>Our experience of the varied musical traditions of our respective homes has meant that as a band we’ve been able to create a unique sound, which has received some really positive responses from audiences and promoters:</p><p>“Their own compositions are superb, their playing together is tight and focused and they are all hugely talented musicians”- <b>Joan Michael, Events Organiser- The Ceilidh Place</b> (Venue of The Year MG Alba Trad Music Awards 2014).</p><p>“One of Scotland’s brightest up and coming bands”- <b>Stonehaven Folk Festival </b></p><p><b>What we hope to do:</b></p><p>Given this feedback, and being asked countless times by audience members we’re now looking to record our debut album. it's going to be called “Trig”, referring to a trig point found at the top of a hill. </p><p>The album is going to be a collection of tunes and songs, some self-penned, some traditional and the rest borrowed from our favourite composers. Our choices reflecting our three main sources of inspiration: People, place and tradition. Trig will act as a marker of how we’ve combined these elements as well as our varied musical backgrounds to create our own take on contemporary Scottish folk music. </p><p>We’ve been really lucky to secure some fantastic collaborators who’ll help us to make a really great album. It’s going to be produced by Rachel Newton- a musician who’s work we all love and respect hugely, recorded by Mattie Foulds who’s recorded some of our favourite-sounding albums and the artwork will be by Graeme MacDonald- a brilliant photographer and graphic designer with whom we worked to make our promo photos. </p><p>With these guys on board we’re confident that with Trig our music will be sounding (and looking) as good as possible!</p><p><b>Where crowdfunding comes in:</b></p><p>The total cost of recording, producing, printing and distributing Trig is £8299. </p><p>We’ve managed to organise ourselves and get most of this sum in place, but we’re £2000 short of the total.

We’ve had a totally fantastic time arranging and writing music together and we’ve been really lucky to share this with people at some brilliant venues and festivals.Our experience of the varied musical traditions of our respective homes has meant that as a band we’ve been able to create a unique sound, which has received some really positive responses from audiences and promoters:“Their own compositions are superb, their playing together is tight and focused and they are all hugely talented musicians”- Joan Michael, Events Organiser- The Ceilidh Place (Venue of The Year MG Alba Trad Music Awards 2014).“One of Scotland’s brightest up and coming bands”- Stonehaven Folk Festival What we hope to do:Given this feedback, and being asked countless times by audience members we’re now looking to record our debut album. it's going to be called “Trig”, referring to a trig point found at the top of a hill. The album is going to be a collection of tunes and songs, some self-penned, some traditional and the rest borrowed from our favourite composers. Our choices reflecting our three main sources of inspiration: People, place and tradition. Trig will act as a marker of how we’ve combined these elements as well as our varied musical backgrounds to create our own take on contemporary Scottish folk music. We’ve been really lucky to secure some fantastic collaborators who’ll help us to make a really great album. It’s going to be produced by Rachel Newton- a musician who’s work we all love and respect hugely, recorded by Mattie Foulds who’s recorded some of our favourite-sounding albums and the artwork will be by Graeme MacDonald- a brilliant photographer and graphic designer with whom we worked to make our promo photos. With these guys on board we’re confident that with Trig our music will be sounding (and looking) as good as possible!Where crowdfunding comes in:The total cost of recording, producing, printing and distributing Trig is £8299. We’ve managed to organise ourselves and get most of this sum in place, but we’re £2000 short of the total. Through this crowdfunding campaign we're hoping to raise the remaining money.The help of any and all crowdfunding contributions are totally invaluable and much appreciated!Obviously we’re not just going to ask for your money and not offer anything in return. As well as our undying gratitude we’ve also got a range of different rewards on offer: Advance album copies, sleeve note dedications, gig tickets, music lessons, house concerts and a whole range of other stuff!  Looking forward:Trig is vital to Tannara’s future- we love writing and playing music together and making this album really is the next step for us.In a practical sense, having Trig will generate income for the band. It will be a permanent way for audience members to engage with our music and the income will support us in doing what we do best- touring and playing live!Working with Mattie, Rachel and Graeme will have our music sounding better than ever before. It’ll be really satisfying of us to have a permanent record of the music we’ve made so far and means that we can get on with writing new stuff!It’ll also be a great means of boosting our profile creating the potential for radio plays and press reviews, as well as serving as a calling card when booking new gigs.

<h3>Description du projet</h3>
<p>Après plusieurs mois à se rencontrer dans un vieux local de pratique pas mal <i>rock</i> sur l'avenue du Parc, nous avons finalement fait le grand saut vers la réalisation de notre premier album, <strong><i>L'humeur des calorifères</i></strong>. Auto-produit et nomade, l'enregistrement s'est effectué un peu partout au Québec, d'un chalet au Lac à l'Anguille (merci Isa et Nathalie) à un salon de Saint-Hubert (merci maman et Diane), en passant par quelques-unes de nos demeures entre Montréal et Sainte-Agathe. Cet album est profondément imprégné de l'environnement au sein duquel il s'est élaboré, rempli de folklore détourné, d'influences progressives assumées et de longues et montréalaises <i>rides</i> de vélo réflexives. </p>

<p>Le groupe <i>Saligaude </i>s'est silencieusement donné naissance il y a quelques années sur les bancs d'école du cégep de Saint-Laurent.

<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</h3>
<p>Nous avons fait le choix de l'auto-production, de l'indépendance et de l'implication collective en temps et en efforts. Cependant, comme vous le savez, l'enregistrement d'un album comporte inévitablement des frais. Bien que nous ayons assumé pendant l'enregistrement les dépenses de macaroni, de toasts, de bière et de café, il existe aussi des frais plus importants que vous pouvez nous aider à couvrir en achetant l'album en prévente ici, à savoir:</p>
<ul>
<li>Le matériel de promotion (affiches, <i>flyers</i> pour le lancement du 10 février (!!!), etc.)</li>
<li>Le mastering (par le beau Xavier Madore)</li>
<li>Le graphisme</li>
<li>L'impression des albums</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>L'impact</h3>
<p>Cette campagne de sociofinancement nous permettra de couvrir (presque en temps réel!) une grande partie des dépenses qu'impliquent la production de l'album. Bien sûr, la carte VISA est toujours derrière nous lorsque vient le temps de faire imprimer des centaines de copies physiques d'un disque que l'on veut tenir entre nos mains. Mais en soutenant notre projet, vous aidez <i>Saligaude </i>à atteindre le déficit zéro (<i>oh yes</i>) et vous aidez à préserver l'enthousiasme qui nous enflamment à l'idée de vous présenter le fruit de notre travail!</p>

<h3>Le mot de la fin (là où tout commence)</h3>
<p>Nous le savons bien, vous êtes tous et toutes régulièrement sollicités par des dizaines d'autres excellents groupes qui ont aussi besoin de financement pour mener à terme leur projet. Les stimulations publicitaires et spectaculaires qui habitent notre quotidien peuvent semer la confusion et simplement nous rendre réfractaires à toute demande.</p>
<p><br/>Mais, lorsque l'on sort du métro au mois de décembre, les mains dans les poches, le regard par terre, en ignorant les affiches électorales, les logos épileptiques et le camelot du journal 24h, qu'est-ce qui joue dans notre <i>iPod</i>? <br/><br/>Des tounes, enregistrées par des musiciens et des musiciennes dévoués à leur art.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We have embarked on a historic two month tour of North America performing at many prestigious music festivals and venues in Canada and the United States. The tour includes some 25 cities such as Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver, Chicago, Washington DC, Edmonton, Portland, Calgary, Minneapolis, Winnipeg and New York. This tour coincides with the release of Ayo (Goodbye), our long anticipated album in honour of Belize's late cultural icon, Andy Palacio. This is without doubt the most ambitious international tour ever by a Belizean artist but it is also the most expensive!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>To give you an idea, here are some numbers:</strong></p>
<p>55 Days on the road</p>
<p>18,450 total number of miles traveled</p>
<p>275 Hotel rooms</p>
<p>1485 Number of meals</p>
<p>90 Plane tickets</p>
<p>plus van rentals, fuel, tolls, gear rental, travel &amp; medical insurance, work visas, permits, extra luggage ect...</p>
<p>From the tour pictures and the large crowds we've been playing, you would think that getting such great exposure automatically means large incomes. Unfortunately it doesn't, being on the road for such long period is very expensive and we pay all of our expenses from the monies we receive from the festivals and concert promoters.</p>
<p><strong>Here is how it works:</strong> Our record label and international booking agents have worked tirelessly for many months in putting together this tour by convincing festival programmers and music promoters to book the band. Then, they hire independent music publicists to promote and market the tour. During the tour we receive all the fees collected from the festivals and thevenues (minus a small booking agency and managment commission) and we put it all in one big pot. We then pay all our bills from there.</p>
<p>A few unforeseen expenses and increased travel costs have left us with quite a big deficit and we urgently need your support to ensure that we can cover all the costs before returning home to Belize on August 11th.</p>
<p>We want to ask our friends and fans to help us raise US$15,000 in the next 30 days, your contributions will go directly to paying for travel, accommodations and perdiems for the seven traveling band members during the last 20 days of the tour.</p>
<p>Concert fees and Cd sales during the tour are already covering more that 80% of our total tour budget, we just need a little extra push!</p>
<p>We've figured that if we can get 100 friends to contribute $50 and 100 to contribute $100 , That would put us over the finish line!</p>
<p>We have been working very very hard to make Belize proud.</p>
<p><strong>We love representing our country</strong> but we cannot afford to go back home with a huge debt that could take us years to repay and it would greatly diminish our chances of touring again in North America.</p>

<p>Please share this with your friends and encourage them to contribute.</p>

Technology has helped by making the recording process cheaper and music promotion more hands-on but it is still an investment. Despite how easy it is now to transform your basement into a digital recording studio, music still needs to be composed, arranged and performed by human beings. And human beings still need to eat and pay bills.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like many other singer/songwriters, I want to create my music exactly how I've envisioned it and then reach out directly to people who relate to what I'm singing about. Even though being an independent artist was initially a necessity rather than a choice, I feel extremely lucky to have avoided becoming tied to the music industry. I've never had an agent or manager, never signed a recording or publishing contract. and most importantly never sang a song I didn't believe in.</p>
<p>I've recorded over a hundred songs in twenty years of being an artist in Northern Ontario. I've tried to stay true to my roots and always placed friendship over all.  My songs are about who I am and where I live. The musicians I work with are like brothers and sisters. I know the music I've created is 100% real. I've played folk, rock, country and traditional but all of it has come from the heart.</p>
<p>I'd like the opportunity to make a new record, my 10th in a journey that has taken me from the bars of Sudbury to concerts all over Canada. I believe the songs I've written in the last few years are some of my best. They are simple, direct, and, most importantly, tell a story. I've avoided starting this project until now because I knew it had to be special, bringing all of what I’ve learned and all of what I’ve experienced together.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You can help me make my new record, in fact, it won't get done without you. I have the passion and the commitment to bring my best and most personal songs to life. My budget is small because I've learned how to make a good record with basic tools. I can count some of the best musicians in the world as my friends. But most importantly I’m doing this for the right reasons. Not to become a star or win awards or sell songs to Apple. I simply want to sing these songs for you. Like the song says,</p>

I've been playing guitar since the age of fourteen; since that time, I've managed to become a pretty good guitar player, and yet I have never in my life, ever, owned an amplifier that could be considered anything approaching ""good"". 
    I'm in a band now (Jezebel County Hospital), and things have been going swell. But I've been dependent upon the good graces of others better endowed in the equipment department. Wait, I mean --that is to say they have nice amps they let me borrow. And borrowing something so essential to rocking on a regular basis is just not a good situation. 
    THE PITCH
    We're looking towards getting a lot more gigs this fall. I need an amp. So please give me your money. AND there's goodies to be gotten if you give me your money, such as: thank you letters; our EP once we get it finished (soon!); and --for the right price-- even the possibility of a song written just for lil ol you! 
    ALSO, FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF SOME MORE
    AND for every dollar given, a matching dollar will be donated by The Human Fund to the efforts to solve the world-wide suffering crisis that's been going on this past little bit. The suffering has to stop, y'all, and only we can do it!

<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>What you just watched above is a video of a classical music performance.  <a href=""http://www.fungchiuduo.com/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>The Fung-Chiu Duo's</a> project is to make a music-video in a pop culture sense.</p>
<p>We're big fans of pop music videos, having grown up with MTV and MuchMusic, and it got us to thinking... why not do a Music-Vimeo of our own?</p>
<p>If <a href=""http://vimeo.com/24020648"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Danny MacAskill</a> can come out of nowhere and make a world-leading music-video for mountain-biking, and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/56490557"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seb Toots</a> can do the same for snowboarding; like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UVNT4wvIGY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gotye</a> has done for pop duos, then Fung-Chiu has the opportunity to do the same for classical duos!</p>
<p>The Fung-Chiu Duo is hard at work on our first Music-Vimeo!  Fung-Chiu is partnering with an incredible videographer, Alexandra Oakley, who has just returned from videography-ing a <a href=""http://vimeo.com/43498899"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tour-du-monde,</a> and an amazing recording engineer, Philip Gosselin, to bring duo classical music to the Vimeo generation.</p>
<p>The Fung-Chiu Duo has performed ~100 concerts including Montréal, Toronto, Vancouver, Québec, and Halifax, from major concert halls to elementary school gymnasiums, and from churches to a casino. This Music-Vimeo will introduce new world audiences to our distinctive duo-izations.</p>
<p>To make Music-Vimeo history, we need your help!</p>

<p>Until now, we have funded our projects privately and through concert tours, but this time we need you to join the Fung-Chiu team.  Here's how we plan to proceed:</p>
<p>$5,000</p>
<p>We've set a minimum budget of $5,000 to record, edit, and produce our Music Vimeo.  We *could* afford to do it at this price point, with a simpler storyline, minimal editing and shooting time.  This music video would be good, but...  </p>
<p>$7,500</p>
<p>Now we're cooking!  We can really dig into the more creative and crazy ideas that we have for this Vimeo!  If we hit this target, we'll be able to up the production values with special effects, multiple locations, and more time in post-production for a pretty sweet production.</p>
<p>$10,000</p>
<p>This gives us the opportunity to bring the video back to you, the folks who have supported this special project from the beginning. When we reach this target, we will have premiere events in Montreal and Toronto, and everyone who has supported us will receive a VIP invite! Reaching this goal will allow us to reach beyond just the usual classical music market (3%) and reach the rest of the world (97%)!</p>
<p>Every single cent raised will go directly into the production and marketing of this video.</p>

THE PROJECT
What you just watched above is a video of a classical music performance.  The Fung-Chiu Duo's project is to make a music-video in a pop culture sense.
We're big fans of pop music videos, having grown up with MTV and MuchMusic, and it got us to thinking... why not do a Music-Vimeo of our own?
If Danny MacAskill can come out of nowhere and make a world-leading music-video for mountain-biking, and Seb Toots can do the same for snowboarding; like Gotye has done for pop duos, then Fung-Chiu has the opportunity to do the same for classical duos!
The Fung-Chiu Duo is hard at work on our first Music-Vimeo!  Fung-Chiu is partnering with an incredible videographer, Alexandra Oakley, who has just returned from videography-ing a tour-du-monde, and an amazing recording engineer, Philip Gosselin, to bring duo classical music to the Vimeo generation.
The Fung-Chiu Duo has performed ~100 concerts including Montréal, Toronto, Vancouver, Québec, and Halifax, from major concert halls to elementary school gymnasiums, and from churches to a casino. This Music-Vimeo will introduce new world audiences to our distinctive duo-izations.
To make Music-Vimeo history, we need your help!
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
Until now, we have funded our projects privately and through concert tours, but this time we need you to join the Fung-Chiu team.  Here's how we plan to proceed:
$5,000
We've set a minimum budget of $5,000 to record, edit, and produce our Music Vimeo.  We *could* afford to do it at this price point, with a simpler storyline, minimal editing and shooting time.  This music video would be good, but...  
$7,500
Now we're cooking!  We can really dig into the more creative and crazy ideas that we have for this Vimeo!  If we hit this target, we'll be able to up the production values with special effects, multiple locations, and more time in post-production for a pretty sweet production.
$10,000
This gives us the opportunity to bring the video back to you, the folks who have supported this special project from the beginning. When we reach this target, we will have premiere events in Montreal and Toronto, and everyone who has supported us will receive a VIP invite! Reaching this goal will allow us to reach beyond just the usual classical music market (3%) and reach the rest of the world (97%)!
Every single cent raised will go directly into the production and marketing of this video.
(Go Select-A-Perk at the top right!)
BUDGET
MINIMUM BUDGET: $5,000- Videography - three days of filming at $700/day; three days of editing at $350/day- Audiography - ten hours of recording and five hours of editing at $50/hour- Props/Set - $500- Location - $500
BUDGET: $7,500+ special video effects+ make-up and costume+ diverse locations+ additional time for story-boarding, filming and post-production
STRETCH BUDGET: $10,000+ marketing of music-video by web marketing specialist+ distribution of Music-Video to web stations+ distribution of Music-Video to TV stations+ premiere events in Montreal and Toronto

<h3>The Story of the Story:</h3>
<p><em>The Sweethearts of Swing</em>, a Play with Music:</p>
<p>In 1943 Mississippi, a young trumpeter has the chance to fulfill her dream of playing with the hottest all-girl swing band in the country. There's just one catch: she's white, it's a ""colored"" band, and this is the Jim Crow South. </p>
<p>In 2013 New York, playwright Natalie Wilson and composer/arranger Kat Sherrell have the chance to bring this powerful story to a wider audience. We now need to make a demo of the original music to submit to interested theater companies and producers. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>""What's the next step?""</h3>
<p>After a tremendously successful staged reading in NYC on July 16, the likely next step for SWEETHEARTS is an out-of-town tryout or workshop with full-size band, for which we need to be able to submit a demo CD along with the script. We've worked out the following budget to produce a studio recording of 6 numbers from the SWEETHEARTS score: </p>
<table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" dir=""ltr"">

<p>If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still be used toward a making a demo on a smaller scale (which limits the places that will consider the submission). </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Although <em>The Sweethearts of Swing</em> is set 70 years ago, it touches on issues that are highly relevant today. </p>
<p>While dealing with the most sinister sides of fear and bigotry, SWEETHEARTS tells the story of friendships fostered by a common love of swing music, and ultimately carries with it the message that there is strength in diversity and hope for a better future. We firmly believe that this play, inspired by a little-known piece of American history, deserves to be seen and heard by a wider audience.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, I have grown an audience of over half a million with my videos. To expand on my craft, I've decided to start on a concept album with the story of PowerLand, based on a comic I wrote a little over 20 years ago. It tells the journey of Celes Angelwood-Rey, a young orphan who learns the way of a ninja and becomes the vigilante known as the Flare. On her path she meets others who have suffered under the corrupt rulership of a tyrant known as ""The Popcorn Master"". Together they rid PowerLand of his corruption and rebuild their world from the ashes.</p>

The Flare, as what the inhabitants of PowerLand know her as, continually liberates lesser nations under the oppression of the Diamond Rey Empire. Some see her survival as ""extraordinary"" as the Popcorn Master has tried his best to exterminate his relatives, big and small, as he feels that they are a threat to his reign. Yet two of them always seem to escape certain doom; His ex-wife Quantona James, mayor of a futuristic city bearing her name, and his neice, the short-tempered vigilante who has in more cases than one hampered his plans for world domination. Celes is a courier by trade but trains under Quantona's guidance to help her fight for justice.</div><div><br/></div><div>

<p>Legends say that Lina walks like a god among the inhabitants of PowerLand, with superhuman abilities that strike fear in the hearts of anyone she encounters. There are many shrines dedicated to her all over PowerLand but her true followers believe Lina would never sanction such a thing, denying her existence as divine. Though her origins are unknown, Lina's age long mission involves hunting down her evil twin known as the Nightmare. It is said the Nightmare was the instigator behind Bermu's fall.</p>

Imagine a world where the diamond is not only a natural resource but also a source of scientific experimentation that improves the lives of everyone. Now imagine that resouce sought after by a tyrant who limits its advanced technological usage to those who serve him.


The dream, however, began before greed took control... 
There exist those who will fight and even die to keep the diamond free and its many usages available for everyone. One of those such people is Celes Angelwood-Rey.
Celes was a little girl when her home city of Bermu was destroyed by the misuse of the diamond. Years later, Celes learns the way of the ninja to become the vigilante known as the Flare. On her journey, Celes finds others to help her cause and together they liberate their world from a ruthless tyrant known to many as the Popcorn Master.

We would love to have you on board to make this dream a reality! 
Backers will get a PowerLand item of their chosing based on how much they donate.

 I'm working with a producer and a few singers to get the album done
So far, only 4/10 songs are done and each track costs money to produce. I've estimated the remainder cost of the album and reached a total of $1000. That number is the cost for the instrumentals, vocals, mixing and mastering of each song.

There's always the possibility of overacheiving the target amount
I've seen this happen so much to campaigns on this site and I just wonder how that even happens. There might be a chance that it could happen to this one. If it does, the money will be used to fund the manga and music video series following the album. But that's not all! Marketting is the key to get this product out there!

About Me



Over the past several years, I have grown an audience of over half a million with my videos. To expand on my craft, I've decided to start on a concept album with the story of PowerLand, based on a comic I wrote a little over 20 years ago. It tells the journey of Celes Angelwood-Rey, a young orphan who learns the way of a ninja and becomes the vigilante known as the Flare. On her path she meets others who have suffered under the corrupt rulership of a tyrant known as ""The Popcorn Master"". Together they rid PowerLand of his corruption and rebuild their world from the ashes.


Biographies 

1. Celes Angelwood-Rey


The main character of the PowerLand Series. The Flare, as what the inhabitants of PowerLand know her as, continually liberates lesser nations under the oppression of the Diamond Rey Empire. Some see her survival as ""extraordinary"" as the Popcorn Master has tried his best to exterminate his relatives, big and small, as he feels that they are a threat to his reign. Yet two of them always seem to escape certain doom; His ex-wife Quantona James, mayor of a futuristic city bearing her name, and his neice, the short-tempered vigilante who has in more cases than one hampered his plans for world domination. Celes is a courier by trade but trains under Quantona's guidance to help her fight for justice.

2. Det. Othniel Goodman



No one knows exactly where he came from except his wife and fellow temporal agent Zahra. The two of them came to PowerLand in search of their daughter, whom they nicknamed Crystal, after she was abducted by their archnemesis, Dr. James Lunningham several years ago. After settling down in a place known to some as Acid Town, Othniel and Zahra found themselves fighting one of the Popcorn Master's generals, Dr. Michaels, and his monstrous creations that terrorize the inhabitants. 2kReturner and the Forest Flower, codenames the two were known by, have become Acid Town's self-appointed sheriff (Zahra) and deputy (Othniel) for their heroic deeds.

3. Lina Anomaly

Artwork by Neeja
Legends say that Lina walks like a god among the inhabitants of PowerLand, with superhuman abilities that strike fear in the hearts of anyone she encounters. There are many shrines dedicated to her all over PowerLand but her true followers believe Lina would never sanction such a thing, denying her existence as divine. Though her origins are unknown, Lina's age long mission involves hunting down her evil twin known as the Nightmare. It is said the Nightmare was the instigator behind Bermu's fall.

4. Mackie Nexus


Centuries before Bermu existed, a war was fought between two races that were once allies. The Anomaly and the Nexus were two races that once lived in peace until Don Anomaly's greed drove the Nexus into hiding. He accused them of ""overstepping their boundaries"", and thus turned their most trusted of friends into the most hated of all PowerLand. Out of this war rose a champion, Mackie Nexus, a being much like Lina who fought to protect her kind from the treacherous Anomaly. Yet her fate was during the battle against Zeno, one of the Nightmare's generals. Zeno sealed Mackie in a pillar of crystalline rock. Upon her release, almost two milieniums passed. The world was drastically different from the primitive culture she once knew. One thing was for certain, though... Mackie knew that the Nightmare fully controlled PowerLand. It was her plan from the very beginning.

They are also older than the current perception of “desirable” and “attractive”.  The ""Diva Motherhood"" team felt compelled to tell a story that needs to be told and pull back the curtain on a wonderful play for you to behold.Check out more about this project on our Facebook pagehttps://www.facebook.com/divamotherhoodAlso, subscribe to our Twitter handlehttps://twitter.com/DivaMotherhood
TEAM:
 Director and Producer - Archita Mandal Fallini Archita was born in Calcutta, India, grew up in Kuwait, and later moved to Canada and the US, for higher studies. A techie but artist at heart, she currently lives in the bay area. Film gives her a powerful platform upon which to exercise her talents in storytelling and visual arts. She has worked on several short films in different capacities, from script writer, art director, set design, choreography, and most recently director. Archita’s directorial debut, Untread, is a science fiction thriller set in the near future and is being screened at the upcoming Women’s International Film & Arts Festival, 2015. This music video featuring an original score, is a big production. She identifies with message of this video, as she herself is a mother to an eight year old.

Line Producer - Giju John





A multifaceted personality and a highly
accomplished singer, producer, composer and
choreographer, Giju John is very well known in the Film
producers circle of the Bay Area.  In 2010, Giju  successfully
produced  ""Love, Wrinkle-free"", a slice of life romantic comedy
set in the backdrops of Goa partnering with writer director Sandeep Mohan.
In 2014, he produced his second movie- ""Hola Venky!"". A former
world-ranked salsa dancer and choreographer, Giju launched the first
ever cross-over music album (in 2007) fusing rich elements of Indian and Latin
music. 
He was very inspired by our theme on
Motherhood and decided to be a part of our team. We are fortunate to have him
as our Line Producer & consider him to be a huge asset owing to his
vast experience and knowledge.

Music Composer - Farhan Mohamed



Music
composer Farhan Mohamed, who holds a degree in audio engineering,
music production and computer music, works at Plantronics. Prior to this,
he worked as a music engineer at Muse Research for 9 years where he provided

Alicia Keys, U2's Vertigo tour, Roger Waters 2010 Wall tour, Genesis,
David Gilmour, Michael Jackson's O2 tour, Coldplay, and Billy Joel, just
to name a few. He has also had the great fortune of working with ace music
composer A.R.Rehman and James Newton Howard. Farhan is
currently composing music for an upcoming Indian movie along with a series of
animation projects. He actively plays and records with the surf band, the
Aquamarines, Utopian Trap, and the Bollywood fusion band, VDAZE.

The Diva Motherhood team is truly thrilled to have such an accomplished Music

Director of
Photography - Unnikrishnan Reveendranathan


Unni is an award winning photographer and
multi media artist who is currently based in San Francisco. Unni has worked as

photography educational award and attended the Eddie Adams workshop, won the
AARP assignment and has worked with them.  He has several assignments
under his belt including Appro, Be4Media, The Astrologer Inc. etc, just to name
a few. Unni has worked on many short films and this would be his second project
with Archita, the first being Untread.
We are very thrilled to have him on our team,
yet again, as our Director of Photography.

Some things to note:


The expenses are broken down in the pie-chart below
This project is part production, part
donation  


                How will funds be used? 


 




ASSET - Stands for Achieving
Sustainable Social Equality through Technology, strives to educate and provide
better opportunities for the children of sex workers.



        
   Why choose ASSET?



As a large group of
women associated with this project have been privileged to come from technical
backgrounds, including the director, we felt the need to collaborate with an
organization that reaches out and helps underprivileged children gain ""basic
information technology skills and secure employment
opportunities"" (as defined by ASSET). 
This contribution serves two
purposes. One, is that this gesture represents the aura of motherhood. We care for other women and kids and if this is a small way we can participate, we
will. Second, we stand for everything that ASSET has set out to achieve and is
doing it so wonderfully. We want to help raise
awareness and make a social impact with the making of this music video.


   Who is in the cast?




Auditions were conducted to select cast members for this video.

I went to my first All Ages punk show back when I was 14 years old and, not only did that experience make me want to become a musician, but it changed my entire view of a sense of community. For the first time, I felt surrounded by like-minded individuals and I felt as though I was a part of something bigger than myself. At this point and time, my best friend and I have decided to open our own All Ages music venue and give back that sense of unity and togetherness that our old music scenes help create for us. Currently, there isn't a place like this in our city of Knoxville, TN and, with your help, we fully intend on creating one. Don't worry grown-ups, we will have events for you as well. We have currently signed a lease on, what we feel, is the perfect building for us to start this venue. We move in at the start of March and will begin to prepare for our grand opening. We have several renovations that have to be dealt with before we can open. This is where you all come in. We are asking for a donation $1000 to help us build several sectional walls, make improvements to our sound system, and general design work to the interior of the building to ensure you the best and intimate live music experience possible. Even the smallest donation of $1 is incredibly helpful.

<p>In early 2006 SappyFest was just an idea. 250 people showed up for that idea and those 250 people made SappyFest a reality. Now we are looking for 250 people to come together and support the idea of SappyFest again. This time by helping to create SappyForever, a unique and beautiful coffee table book of memories and dreams that came true.<br/></p>
<p>In many ways SappyFest 8 was the best festival yet, but it was not a financial success. This was due in part to our aversion to corporate sponsorship and our commitment to our vision of a creative and inclusive space. Unfortunately we were about 100 people short of breaking even, we are $15,000 in debt. Our black dot is a reality but we have not given up hope.<br/></p>
<p>We have a plan. It is called SappyForever. We are asking 250 people to buy a beautiful, hardcover archive of SappyFest for $100. We hope to raise $25,000 to pay off our debt from the great festival we just put on, with the additional $10,000 covering the production and publication of SappyForever. This 160 page collection will include photos, essays, memories and a visual history of the art and design that has come to define the best days of summer for us all. We will also be donating a copy to a library in every province and territory in Canada.<br/></p>
<p>We are inviting each donor to contribute a photo of themselves or their friends at SappyFest to be included in a 'Presented by' section. This book is for all of us who were there, or wanted to be there and who believed Swamp Magic could happen.<br/></p>
<p>This has been an incredibly difficult year for our organization. It may take time for SappyFest to rebuild, but we are committed to do so. This will also mark the last year that co-founders Paul Henderson and Jon Claytor will serve as artistic and creative directors. They will assist in the transition, passing on the torch to an amazing group of young people ready and willing to bring SappyFest into the future. <br/></p>
<p>SappyFest has been a labour of love and a privilege for all who have been involved. So many of you have already given so much blood, sweat, tears and time to making the festival a success. The future is ambiguous and exciting and it depends on you.<br/></p>
<p>Are there 250 people out there ready to support this beautiful idea, this indelible memory and this ambiguous future? We hope so. We have our hopes up. We believe and we hope you do too.<br/></p></span></div>","SappyForever: Rescue Mission as Coffee Table Book

</h3><p>We are Marco and Sara Castro. We make music together and we'd love to share with all of you what we've been up to for the past 3 years. In 2011 we released our first effort, ""The Tiny Airplane EP"", which was basically a humble demo but with lots and lots of heart. Although we've been ""enhancing"" it thorough the years by adding a couple of songs here and there, we feel the time has come for us to release a new album. <br/></p><p>We are also embarking on a huge adventure throughout Europe this summer to perform the 25 day <a href=""http://www.songsandwhispers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Songs &amp; Whispers</a>
 circuit based in Bremen, Germany and we are currently 
working on setting up a small European tour before and after (we still 
can't believe it!). We're beyond excited to make this new album and share it with all of you and our friends in Europe. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Our goal is to raise $5500 which will help us cover part of the costs of both projects.  We hope you can partner with us to raise the funds to help make them happen. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Of perks and tiers<br/>
</h3>We have a lot of perks to give back to you in exchange of your help!<br/>For example, if you are able to donate $30, you will get a physical copy of our album + deluxe digital download before it's released as well as a full download of our first EP! If you are able to donate more, we have other perks for you including backers-only limited edition artwork, tee-shirts and more! Take a look to the right and see what you'd like as a thank you from us for your help.<br/>We tried to create an easy-to-use structure so most gifts are bundled. If you'd like get just one of the perks without bundling please let us know and we'll work it out.<br/><p></p><p>All the original artwork is made by Sara. For the perks that include an art print of your choice, please visit to the following links and find the name(s) of the piece(s) you want!

We are Marco and Sara Castro. We make music together and we'd love to share with all of you what we've been up to for the past 3 years.

Although we've been ""enhancing"" it thorough the years by adding a couple of songs here and there, we feel the time has come for us to release a new album. We are also embarking on a huge adventure throughout Europe this summer to perform the 25 day Songs & Whispers
 circuit based in Bremen, Germany and we are currently 
working on setting up a small European tour before and after (we still 
can't believe it!). We're beyond excited to make this new album and share it with all of you and our friends in Europe. Our goal is to raise $5500 which will help us cover part of the costs of both projects.  We hope you can partner with us to raise the funds to help make them happen. Of perks and tiers

Along side these two organisations, we have The Yorkshire Gig Guide, Eclectic Rhythm and The Topic Folk Club all working together on a voluntary basis to not only support and promote grass roots music and artiest's in our local area, but to also do this to try an raise awareness and funds for the Peace Project. ""The Piece Project is run by a committee made up of people with interests in music; DJ's, youth workers, mental health/disabilities professionals and representatives from community based grass roots organisations. All are interested in community development/regeneration""This campaign is aimed at raising enough funds to implement the basic structure to the festival and provide the best possible experience to all those who attend.We invite you to get in touch, get involved, get donating and help us produce a music and arts festival to be remembered!   What We Need & What You GetOK, so overall we need around £5000 to pay for the full festival. We hope the festival will be self-financing and to also raise a surplus of funds in support of the valuable work of the Piece Project. This donation appeal is aimed at ensuring we have enough working funds to finance the festival in its early stages and will include:
Equipment costs,
Stage hire,
Production Costs,
Toilets, 
And more...
Please remember – none of the festival organisers get paid and the performers and artists appearing have donated their time for free, so your donations will go straight into covering the overall costs of this unique weekend event. Any surplus over costs will go to The Piece Project, In return of your generous donations, we have on offer; your name on the donation wall of fame (on-line), a chosen print of one of Eclectic Rhythms t-shirt designs, a free unique/hand screen printed/limited edition t-shirt designed by Eclectic Rhythm, day and weekend tickets, logo design work and a responsive businesses card website.

</h3><h2><b>Our Story</b></h2>
<p>Hey there, we are Summerhill! We are
passionate about Jesus and our heart is to lift Him high through our
music. </p>
<p>Over the past 5 years we have been so
incredibly blessed with opportunity after opportunity to lead people in worship
through music. For the first few years of our ministry we were singing great
worship songs written by other artists. In 2012, we felt like the next step for our ministry was
to begin writing songs that flowed from our own hearts and experiences and with
the encouraging help of great friends, family and supporters we were able to go
into the studio to record our debut album, ""With Every Breathe [EP].""
That first album was released on June 6, 2013. We were so inspired by the love
and support that was sent our way and the way our album was received by all
those that had the opportunity to hear it. </p>
<p>So here we are a year later with a
desire to take an even bigger step. While we absolutely loved the experience we
had of getting in to a studio and recording our first album, we knew in our
heart that something was just lacking with a studio album. We realized that we
just can't quite bottle up the energy, emotion and experience that is there
when we lead worship with and for others in a live setting. There's just
nothing like a room full of people pouring out their hearts and lifting up
their voices together. That's what we love and that's what we want to capture!
So we have decided that for our second album we will get out of the studio and
right into the heart of what our ministry is all about to create, Summerhill:
Live at Bogg Springs (oh yeah, and we'll have about 1,000 people there to help
us!).</p>
<p>This is absolutely a big undertaking and
to be quite honest with you; it will not be possible to do it without your
support. With your help and your help alone we will be able to make our live
album on July 24th, 2014. </p>
<p>
</p><h3><b></b></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/657003/files/20140617224631-Instagram_Announcement.jpg?1403070391"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>
<p>So if you’re
thinking that recording a live album is more expensive than a studio album then
you are exactly correct.  We are setting the goal to make this dream a
reality at <b>$10,000</b>. This is a big number to ask for and we would not
even consider asking if we did not believe in the incredible support system
that we have with our friends, family and fans. </p>
<p>This $10,000
will help us bring in a great producer and friend from Nashville who will be

<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>Wrapping It Up....</b></h3>
<p>We are just
over a month away from all of this becoming a reality. There is no doubt that
we are stepping out in faith on this project. But we believe so strongly in the
new music that God has placed on our hearts and the opportunity that we have
right in front of us to make this next album even greater than our first. We
want Summerhill: Live at Bogg Springs to inspire people to worship Jesus daily
through the music. Not because we are anything special but because the God we
are singing about truly is!</p>
<p><br/></p><p>Love, Summerhill</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/657007/files/20140617224949-2013-11-09_14.47.54.jpg?1403070589"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/></div>","Our Story
Hey there, we are Summerhill! We are
passionate about Jesus and our heart is to lift Him high through our
music. 
Over the past 5 years we have been so
incredibly blessed with opportunity after opportunity to lead people in worship
through music. For the first few years of our ministry we were singing great
worship songs written by other artists. In 2012, we felt like the next step for our ministry was
to begin writing songs that flowed from our own hearts and experiences and with
the encouraging help of great friends, family and supporters we were able to go
into the studio to record our debut album, ""With Every Breathe [EP].""
That first album was released on June 6, 2013. We were so inspired by the love
and support that was sent our way and the way our album was received by all
those that had the opportunity to hear it. 
So here we are a year later with a
desire to take an even bigger step. While we absolutely loved the experience we
had of getting in to a studio and recording our first album, we knew in our
heart that something was just lacking with a studio album. We realized that we
just can't quite bottle up the energy, emotion and experience that is there
when we lead worship with and for others in a live setting. There's just
nothing like a room full of people pouring out their hearts and lifting up
their voices together. That's what we love and that's what we want to capture!
So we have decided that for our second album we will get out of the studio and
right into the heart of what our ministry is all about to create, Summerhill:
Live at Bogg Springs (oh yeah, and we'll have about 1,000 people there to help
us!).
This is absolutely a big undertaking and
to be quite honest with you; it will not be possible to do it without your
support. With your help and your help alone we will be able to make our live
album on July 24th, 2014. 

What We Need
So if you’re
thinking that recording a live album is more expensive than a studio album then
you are exactly correct.  We are setting the goal to make this dream a
reality at $10,000. This is a big number to ask for and we would not
even consider asking if we did not believe in the incredible support system
that we have with our friends, family and fans. 
This $10,000
will help us bring in a great producer and friend from Nashville who will be
coming in to oversee the live recording and help us make the best album
possible. The travel, set-up, rehearsals, tracking, recording, mixing,
mastering, the design work, printing, distributing, promotion and all of the
small details that go into making a live album really add up and every dollar
we make in this campaign will go directly to this project. But here is the cool
thing. We are not simply asking for your support without giving you anything in
return. Oh no, we've got something to give you too!

What You Get
(Perks!)
PERK OPTION 1:

This time around, we are making this
extremely simple! Over the months of preparing and planning we kept thinking of
a way to make this project more personal. So we decided to not only set a
financial goal, but a goal to get more people involved. We are asking for 1,000
people to pre-buy our album for just $10. While our last campaign was
a success and we achieved our goal, we had less than 50 backers help us raise
all of the financial support. That means a few people invested a lot of money
(thanks again!). But this time around we want more people to invest much less!
This is a special request to us because we have had the opportunity to lead
worship for several thousand people over the past 5 years and hope that through
all the relationships we have built along the way, we will meet this goal. We
believe that there are 1,000 people out there who will become part of the #SH1of1000!
When you donate just $10 to our campaign we will send you an autographed copy
of the album when it is released AND we will put your name in the thank you
section inside the album artwork. (Help us spread the word by using our custom
hashtags #SH1of1000 & #SummerhillGive10)

The next 2

specifically for churches, college ministries and youth ministries to step in
and help us so we can turn around and help you!
PERK OPTION 2:

For a $1000 contribution to our
Indiegogo campaign, Summerhill will come to your town and lead worship for your

anything we can do to minister to the people at your event. We'll also give the
leaders tons of free Summerhill merch to hand out (or keep for themselves!). We
love being around and serving people and that's what it will be all
about. 

PERK OPTION 3:

We have a heart for training and equipping
worship bands. Because of this desire we have created a unique Music
Ministry Clinic where we will spend the day mentoring your worship band.
Every Music Ministry Clinic will be customized to fit the needs for your
specific group. Have a young youth band who needs help in general? Have an
experienced praise band transitioning to a blended or contemporary service? We
can help with all of that! For a $1,000 contribution to our IndieGoGo
campaign we will come in and serve your music team.*
So what would this day with your music
team look like?.....
Group Bible Study focused on Worship.
Individual lessons: (acoustic guitar,
electric, electric, bass, keys, drums, vocals, harmony, music theory,
soundboard 101, mixing the room, monitor mixes, equipment, loops and click
tracs, easy worship, pro presenter, etc...)
Group lessons: (how to get the most out of
your practices, travel logistics, band communication, band dynamics, creating
an atmosphere, bringing it all together, etc...)
One on one work on specific worship songs
that your band is currently learning or desire to play.

Thanks for taking the time to check out our campaign.  The concept of ""Now"" was introduced to me a few months ago in the book ""The Power of Now"" and has really had an impact in my life.  The main idea behind living in the Now is to quiet your mind when you don't need it in order to feel more fully present in each moment and in turn, more alive.  </p>
<p>I started to realize that this idea had seeped into my music and my life in very profound ways, so I decided to start a project that includes my friends, and begin a multi-media campaign to spread the idea of Now to as many people as possible.  We have decided to record an album I have written inspired by this idea. Additionally, we plan to make a music video, a web series documenting how our project is going, and create a number of creative and alternative marketing campaigns in order to introduce the public to our work. <span><br/></span></p>
<p>For me, this project is truly my dreams becoming a reality, and it is also an opportunity for my friends to work in highly specialized fields and get hands on experience in the work they love doing. For me, it is the beginning of my career as a musician, and your help could not be more appreciated.  Making music is the biggest joy in my life, and this project will have 100% of my efforts dedicated to it.  Thank you so much in advance for letting us live our dreams!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></p>

<p><i>Album:</i> $1000</p>

<p>Physical album production: $400-500</p>

<p>This is mostly to cover the Indiegogo fees, but will also be used toward any miscellaneous costs or expenses we have along the way.</p>
<p><i>Additional funding:</i></p>
<p>Any money we raise past the goal amount will go to producing an even better project. We will put additional funding towards higher quality equipment, editing, rewards, and use it to make this project go above and beyond even our expectations.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>One of the most obvious challenges for this project is raising the funding we need. While we're aware it's a significant amount of money, we're hoping the generosity of our friends, family, and fan base will allow us to match or exceed our funding.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to making this project as high quality as possible, even if we are unable to raise our goal. Obviously, the more money we raise, the better quality this project will be, but we believe that we can create something really incredible, and we're confident that we can make it happen.</p>
<p>Other challenges along the way could include things like scheduling conflicts and unexpected expenses, but our core team is dedicated and professional, and we believe that we can face any hardships with positivity and a determination to overcome.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>One of the biggest things we're asking is to spread the word, even if you are unable to donate to our project. We plan to have the music video and the album available to stream for free once the project is completed, and while any financial contribution would be ideal, the most important thing is spreading our message and our music. So please share this project with your friends and family, and help us teach everyone about the power of Now!</p>
