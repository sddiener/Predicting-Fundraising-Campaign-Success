 A Little About Me
I've had the honor of being able to specialize in women’s health care for over 35 years and make preventive and integrative medicine the foundation of my approach to that care.  During these years I was fortunate to  provide clinical services, write, teach, direct women's health related programs, and evaluate the care being given to women by their health care providers. And like so many, I have lost family, patients, friends and colleagues to breast cancer. 
All of these experiences combined with watching the ways in which women's breast health continues to be ignored led to me the research, and ultimately, to writing the book.  Previously authored books include Say Goodbye to PMS, The Fertility Awareness Workbook, and the textbook A Total Wellness Approach to the Care of Peri and Post Menopausal Women.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

each time. I was too out of it to even think why I was there. My grandma told
me that everyday I for about 1 ï¿½<span style="""">  </span>months,
I was taken to surgery and sedated to wash all the debris out of my legs. Then
they would always have to give me 3 to 4 pints of blood after the surgeries
just to replace what I lost. When the nurse would come in to clean my legs,
they would lift them up and they said I would ask what those things were. The
nurses replied, ï¿½those are your legsï¿½. Then I would just turn my head away. </span><span style='font-size: 14pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif""; color: rgb(0, 51, 0);'>. The doctor had a meeting with my family and
told them they have done everything they can do yet I wasnï¿½t responding to
anything. I was really worried about school. It was my senior year, which is

I was in a car wreck in 04.The next thing I knew, Iï¿½m waking up in a
rehabilitation hospital with both my legs gone and my body was soo sore!! Now I
didnï¿½t exactly wake up, I would just open my eyes and someone new was there
each time. I was too out of it to even think why I was there. My grandma told
me that everyday I for about 1 ï¿½  months,
I was taken to surgery and sedated to wash all the debris out of my legs. Then
they would always have to give me 3 to 4 pints of blood after the surgeries
just to replace what I lost. When the nurse would come in to clean my legs,
they would lift them up and they said I would ask what those things were. The
nurses replied, ï¿½those are your legsï¿½. Then I would just turn my head away. . The doctor had a meeting with my family and
told them they have done everything they can do yet I wasnï¿½t responding to
anything. I was really worried about school. It was my senior year, which is
all I have been waiting for, for 12 years and I am in the hospital. I was being fed through a stomach feeding tube
which I would throw it up every time theyï¿½d give it to me. So I was really
skinny!! <!--[if gte mso 9]>",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Going through high school I had my life planned out. I was going to go to Fresno State University and become a sign language interpreter. The end of my senior year (2008) I was sure I found my soul mate, Willie Gardner. The, in my mind, cutest boy in school, number one on the football team, a lot of girl wanted him and he was mine. Luckily, we were both accepted to Fresno State—although he did not have a football scholarship for that school. He left his scholarships and moved with me to Fresno, California. Life seemed perfect at the time. We got our own apartment, and went to school.</p>
<p>After only 10 months from our first date, on January 22, 2009, my eighteenth birthday, we got married. One month after marriage we decided we wanted kids, we got pregnant nearly instantly. The one thing he didn’t realize was that with pregnancy comes hormones. He started pulling away, and decided he wanted to get separated. I was extremely stressed out and ended up going into preterm labor at 22 weeks. Labor was stopped and I was put on bed rest. At this point my husband decided it would be perfect timing to leave me in Fresno and move back down to San Diego with his mother. My mom then of course came up and moved me back down to her house in San Diego. I gave birth to my 3lb 6oz baby  boy, Willie Jr. at 30 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>After having our son we decided we would give it another try. After all, this was my one true love, right? My heart could never be torn from him, and unfortunately he knew it. He started to become extremely controlling and abusive. It got to the point that if I even answered his phone call by saying, “hello” instead of, “hi babe” I would pay for it. I finally got the nerve to call the police. After the report (he ran away when I called) he came back swore it wouldn’t happen again and I apologized for calling. But, nothing changed. As time passed, I called the police 3 more times.</p>
<p>I became pregnant again, this time not planned, even though I was on birth control. He left again. I couldn’t afford the rent on my own, so I moved back with my mom. I had my daughter, Natillie, full term at 6lbs 14oz.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
I am a single mother of two kids, not receiving any help from the kids’ father. He up and moved to Las Vegas and has gotten arrested multiple times since. He comes around every few months to see my babies. Willie Jr. is going to turn three on September 28, 2012 and has caught up in size to a full-term child. The only thing that has not caught up is his lungs. I have been receiving government help by having my children and myself on Medi-cal, and food stamps. Now, according to the government, I make too much money to have any help. I can handle the food, but health insurance is getting cut off as well. My son, who has severe asthma is in the emergency room at least once a month, if not more, with troubled breathing and oxygen lowering as low as 85%. My daughter, who just turned one year old, has started showing signs of asthma, but not near as severe. I am asking for help to be able to afford health insurance and help with the cost of medications and co-pays for my children. Unfortunately, unlike Medi-cal, other health insurances do not cover 100% of prescription costs or hospital visits. I am asking for $8,000 dollars to help me get insurance for the kids as well as put money away for the times he is admitted into the hospital.</div>

My goal is to help all those who have struggled to eat healthier with my new cookbook ""Shake Lunch Up"".</p>
<p>""Shake Lunch Up"" offers up healthy shakes, soups, salads, sandwiches, and lunchtime meals, with easy to read recipes and beautifully styled food photography by New York photographer Will Vaultz (<a href=""http://www.willvaultz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.willvaultz.com</a>).</p>
<p>These tasty lunchtime recipes focus on using fresh produce, whole grains and lean meats and time saving easy to follow recipes. All celebrate the Southern flavors I grew up with as well as the Southwestern, Thai and international flavors I use as a professional chef. ""Shake Lunch Up"" also offers delicious lunchtime meal plans and great tips on packing wholesome meals for family and work. The cookbook also highlights natural healthful and convenant supplements for people on the move.</p>
<p>Why did I write ""Shake Lunch Up""? Well, ten years ago I found myself seventy pounds overweight. Fast food was my weakness. Processed and fried foods were a part of my daily diet. My midday cravings often resulted in poor food choices at lunchtime that set me up for failure the rest of the day and made it impossible to maintain an active lifestyle. I new in my spirit and heart that I needed to make a change but struggled with how to make healthy daily choices.</p>
<p>Through my love of cooking I discovered the benefits of eating whole foods, I lost the weight and I didn't look back. However, I haven't sacrificed the family recipes, foods and flavors that I love, I've simply learned to recreate them in a new way.</p>
<p>""Shake Lunch Up"""" reflects my journey and passion to share the word with youth and adults that change is possible you just have to shake things up!</p>
<p><strong>The Funding</strong></p>
<p>What is the money for? Most will go towards pre-production cost for the cookbook (food, materials, studio location sites etc.) Additional monies will go towards the postproduction of the book: things like hiring a professional editor, further refinements on the digital editions, and print edition as well. It will also help to continue my work in the community with youth and adults looking to transition to healthier ways of eating through demos and outreach.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. My name is Heather and I've been living with Lyme disease for most of my life, since I was six or seven years old; I'm 31 now. I was diagnosed a little over seven years ago, at age 24. Since then I've been in and out of treatment, depending on finances, life circumstances, and symptom severity. It's a miracle I'm alive at all; in late 2004 - when I first fell so ill I finally had to concede there was something physically wrong with me and the doctors who'd told me all my life that I was a hopeless hypochondriac were gravely mistaken - I was bedridden, unable to read, write, process information, digest food, or hold a coherent conversation. I weighed 85 pounds and my days consisted of writhing in bed in agonizing neurological pain. To read my Lyme story in full (it's too long and gruesome to recount here), feel free to visit the following URL -- <a href=""http://lymenaide.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/my-lyme-disease-is-not-the-idsa-lyme-disease-heather/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lymenaide.wordpress.com/2010/12/11/my-ly...</a></p>
<p>For the past several years I've been lucky enough to have the financial support of my grandparents for basic daily living expenses; with that money I was also able to afford some Lyme treatment (though never IV antibiotics, which would've been ideal for my severe case; and I haven't had health insurance since my college years). My grandparents passed away recently, however, and family support is waning fast. Most of my family doesn't believe or acknowledge that I'm ill; the few family members who do are unable to support me financially or fund my treatments.</p>
<p>Recently, and for the first time in a few years, I started a part-time job. This gig is only a few hours per week, but it's great, and I feel so blessed to have it. I'm also looking for another job and am hoping I'm well enough to work 20 hours per week; however, to be honest, I'm not certain my body's up for the challenge. I don't have much choice, as I need to do what I need to do to survive, keep housing over my head, keep myself and my two cats fed. I'm also in the very beginning stages of applying for disability. For years I was told I was ineligible, but I just discovered recently that SSA has a little-known program to which I can apply to receive some monthly help. Unfortunately, the application process is long and grueling, and approval could take months or years.</p>
<p>I hate asking for assistance. It's incredibly difficult for me. Anyone who knows me knows I don't even let people grocery shop for me or make me food when I'm too sick to do it myself. It's difficult to accept the fact that I can't work full-time to support myself. True, it's been seven years, but there is still some part of me that's in denial of my disability. I was supposed to go to grad school. I was supposed to have a career by now, maybe a family. Instead I've been in limbo since I graduated college, and without help it's possible I'll stay here for the rest of my life, or worse, deteriorate further.</p>
<p>There are things I want to do. There is a reason I'm here. Deep down this is something I know is true. There is a reason I've suffered through years of excruciating illness, often disbelieved, cast off by both family and friends because this reality is such a difficult one to comprehend. I know when I heal (yes, when - I refuse to allow myself any other language), I'll bring something to this world I never would've been capable of had I lived my life the way I intended: healthy, physically strong, on a clear path, no grueling vision quest as detour. From my own extensive experience with various doctors and healers, I know the best healers have been deeply wounded, have endured an unparalleled darkness. When I emerge from the fires of this, I want to help others access their own healing. What better preparation than a decade-long, neurological, near-fatal illness? Maybe this is my initiation, my schooling. But the fact is that I need to emerge from this place if I ever hope to contribute in the way I so deeply want. And to emerge, I need your help. There have been some desperately dark days lately. Days I want only to give up, because I see no hope of anything different. This is my attempt to walk back into the light. To declare to myself that my path, my journey, my life is worth it. That I - one lone person with no partner or children, no one for whom I must stay - am worth saving.</p>
<p>With your help, I hope to become well enough to accomplish a few key endeavors (it's easy to forget aspirations and goals when you spend years upon years in an illness twilight; this paragraph is, most of all, a reminder to myself): grad school in poetry and/or transpersonal psychology; yoga teacher certification; reiki certification; shamanic studies; massage school; publishing a book of poetry; lots of fiddlin' and perhaps taking on some fiddle students; and seeing the world, as I haven't left the US in over 14 years. Above all, I want to continue being a kind person, as kindness is the foremost lesson illness has taught me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this, and for your generosity of heart. It means more than I can possibly express.</p>

The Impact


Severe childhood eczema is a worsening global problem. In
some parts of the world, eczema rates in children now exceed 30% and continue to
climb, with no acknowledged cure. 
Asthma and allergies often accompany eczema. Eczema can cause
unrelenting itching, pain, chronic sleep deprivation, skin infections, social
problems from poor appearance, behavioral effects, even impaired social
development. When a child has this miserable disease, a whole family suffers.

Short Summary You might have heard about Antibiotic Resistance or Superbugs. Have you ever wondered what exactly that is? How it's happening? Why should we worry? and what can you do to prevent this?
Well… the goal of this project is to answer - in a very easy and fun way - all of these and other questions related to Antibiotic Resistance in bacteria. 
We are a group of multidisciplinary health activists aiming to raise awareness about the importance of appropriate antibiotic use and the threat that superbugs impose. Educating the public about this issue will reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics and will potentially reduce the risk of superbug related infections. Your contribution will help to create a short animated video delivered in multiple languages describing how bacteria are becoming antibiotic resistant, along with the related medical consequences for this phenomena and what we need to do in order to eliminate this threat.
This video will also be used as a publicly available research tool that we will use to measure public understanding about antibiotic use and antibiotic resistant superbugs.
 
What We Need & What You Get
 We need: 
to raise public awareness about this issue.
to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics in all sectors.
to create multimedia materials in different languages to deliver the awareness and educational messages.
your support to create an animated short video aimed at raising awareness and reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
your support will help to facilitate the understanding of the public point-of-view about antibiotic and superbugs.
 
You get:


to join the fight against superbugs!
to enhance the Antibiotics and Superbugs Awareness Campaign.

<p>Thomas Helton is my hero.
He is donating a kidney to me, Kevin Patton. I am calling on you, my friends and family because we are artists and teachers and although
we both have careers and insurance this process is incredibly expensive. I want
to do whatever I can to help ease the burden on him as he gives me the gift of
life. </p>
<p>By contributing to
this campaign you are helping Thomas save my life. Thank you. Thank you from
Carmen, my partner of 20 years. Thank you from Cuauhtémoc, my four-year-old son
and thank you from Itzel, my one-year-old daughter. Thank you from my
students, thank you from the people who have enjoyed my music, thank you from
all those I may touch with my work. </p>
<p>In 2006 I was diagnosed
with IGA Nephropathy. This is a genetic immune system disorder that attacks the
glomeruli, the small capillaries in the kidney that filter the blood. Although
I took a variety of medication and endured two grueling courses of IV immunosuppressive
drugs nothing worked. My nephrologist at the time, Charles Zacham, finally said
to me, ""Kevin yours are not the kind of kidneys we try to
save."" </p>
<p>Transplant is the only
option for me.</p>
<p> My kidneys were operating at less than 10%
from 2012 until they failed completely in 2014. I have been on dialysis ever since.</p>
<p>Although this has been a
challenging time, I feel very fortunate to have a community of support and a
friend like Thomas. We have known each other since 1996 when we were both working
musicians in the Houston jazz scene. When I told him about my desperate
situation he did not hesitate to volunteer. He is a true hero, a man of such
integrity and generosity. I am humbled by his kindness.  </p>
<p>We are asking to raise
$15,000.00. I feel that this may seem like a lot, but the procedure is taking
place at the New York Presbeterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the transplant
center for my region. For example, his stay at the Helmsley Medical Tower, the
hospital housing, may cost up to $9000 if he needs an entire month to recover.
We are expecting it to take at least three weeks before Thomas can go home. He

<p></p></div>","Thomas Helton is my hero.
He is donating a kidney to me, Kevin Patton. I am calling on you, my friends and family because we are artists and teachers and although
we both have careers and insurance this process is incredibly expensive. I want
to do whatever I can to help ease the burden on him as he gives me the gift of
life. 
By contributing to
this campaign you are helping Thomas save my life. Thank you. Thank you from
Carmen, my partner of 20 years. Thank you from Cuauhtémoc, my four-year-old son
and thank you from Itzel, my one-year-old daughter. Thank you from my
students, thank you from the people who have enjoyed my music, thank you from
all those I may touch with my work. 
In 2006 I was diagnosed
with IGA Nephropathy. This is a genetic immune system disorder that attacks the
glomeruli, the small capillaries in the kidney that filter the blood. Although
I took a variety of medication and endured two grueling courses of IV immunosuppressive
drugs nothing worked. My nephrologist at the time, Charles Zacham, finally said
to me, ""Kevin yours are not the kind of kidneys we try to
save."" 
Transplant is the only
option for me.
 My kidneys were operating at less than 10%
from 2012 until they failed completely in 2014. I have been on dialysis ever since.
Although this has been a
challenging time, I feel very fortunate to have a community of support and a
friend like Thomas. We have known each other since 1996 when we were both working
musicians in the Houston jazz scene. When I told him about my desperate
situation he did not hesitate to volunteer. He is a true hero, a man of such
integrity and generosity. I am humbled by his kindness.  
We are asking to raise
$15,000.00. I feel that this may seem like a lot, but the procedure is taking
place at the New York Presbeterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the transplant
center for my region. For example, his stay at the Helmsley Medical Tower, the
hospital housing, may cost up to $9000 if he needs an entire month to recover.
We are expecting it to take at least three weeks before Thomas can go home. He
and his wife Veronica's travel from Houston will cost approximately $1000.00.  Then there is his and Veronica's lost wages.
This totals another estimated $8000 for a month of not working.
We are asking for your support, but we know that times are tight and resources are scarce so we would like to offer you an array of gifts as tokens of our profound appreciation for your generosity.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I healed from depression &amp; anxiety and now I am passionate &amp; committed to helping others heal. My healing journey has taken me around the country and abroad, giving me a background of experience and knowledge I can now share with others. Becoming a life coach will empower me to serve others using the unique blend of skills I’ve acquired plus the latest, hottest techniques for living a happy, purposeful life. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT</strong></h2>
<p>Skills to be happy, peaceful &amp; successful are not taught in schools the way that math and science are. <strong>Coaching gives people the tools to revolutionize the way they think &amp; interact with themselves and others so that life is more satisfying, healthy &amp; joyful. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It is vital that people learn these skills.</strong> Addressing problems in families, communities &amp; the world will be much easier if people have a solid grounding in practical skills of joy &amp; health. </p>
<p><em>I am very concerned about the amount of violence in our country &amp; world- especially amongst teens.</em> We have a lot of work to do as a people to learn to treat each other with unconditional respect &amp; love.<strong> Coaching is a way to teach people to live more lovingly towards themselves and, naturally, that love flows to others. </strong></p>
<p>I have been practicing coaching for a year using tools that I've gained over years of working with coaches, counselors &amp; healing artists. I am ready to commit to a thorough training that will guide me to coach on a professional level. </p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>WHAT I HOPE TO ACHIEVE</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Short term Goal</strong></h3>
<p>I intend to work with individuals and small groups to transform their relationship with <strong>joy &amp; their dreams</strong> so that they can <strong>achieve both<em> more often &amp; more easily</em>. </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>FUN FACTS</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Average goal achievement rate is 30-50%,<strong> with a coach goal achievement rates skyrocket to 95%. </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Heart disease is the NUMBER ONE cause of death in the US amongst adults. Numerous studies in the US &amp;  Europe are showing that<strong> <em>happiness drastically decreases the risk for heart disease.</em> </strong>In a Columbia University study, ""researchers found that the happiest people were 22% less likely to develop heart disease over the 10 years of follow-up."" Other studies show this number to be closer to 35%.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Long Term Goals</strong></h3>
<p>I intend to establish a fruitful coaching practice and support myself through graduate school. </p>
<p>I intend to design a healing modality that combines art &amp; drama with life coaching. This would be an alternative to art/drama therapy that uses coaching techniques rather than therapeutic ones.</p>
<p>I intend to start a coaching program for tweens &amp; teens as they are coming of age so that they can traverse adolescence with the best practices for empowerment &amp; self-determination.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>""No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.""</p>
<p>-Albert Einstein</p>
<p>Problems- whether personal or global- are up in our faces every day. We cannot solve these problems unless we change the way we think, feel &amp; behave. Staying in the same cycle of thought, feeling and behavior just creates more of the same. <strong>Life coaching specifically targets &amp; transforms dysfunctional cycles so that people &amp; life can change on a fundamental level. </strong></p>
<p>My micro-goals as a coach are to empower people to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Achieve their dreams</li>
<li>Make a difference in their community</li>
<li>Relate better with their families</li>
<li>Cultivate unconditional self-love</li>

<li>End cycles of self-abuse that turn into abuse of others &amp; the environment</li>
<li>Redefine business and money exchange to mean authentic service, joy, integrity, gratitude &amp; unconditional abundance. To take the “self-compromise” element OUT of making money.</li>
<li>Awaken the innate creativity &amp; genius in people so they can apply their ideas and passions to remedy the greatest problems we face: poverty, violence, addiction, abuse of our environment, emotional poverty</li>

Now imagine that you used to tirelessly serve the people of your country, but now are hard pressed to have the energy to enjoy your young children. Tezera Mengesha is a man in his mid forties in desperate need of a kidney transplant, and we want to help him get back to his life of helping others.</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Tezera Mengesha was born in 1967 in the Town of Nefas Mewucha, in the District of Lai Gayint in South Gondar Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. He lives in the City of Bahir Dar with his wife and 12 year old daughter.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">After he graduated from high school, Tezera served his country as a soldier until he became a water professional. His work and passion is to provide clean water to the needy in rural and remote areas of Ethiopia. Tezera used his motorbike as a means of transportation to access remote areas tirelessly, without being concerned about his health and safety. For his hard work and contribution to the rural communities, the government gave him several awards and even sent him abroad to gain knowledge and develop his expertise in rural water supply and sanitation. Based on his experience and dedication to help the rural communities, Tezera was promoted to a Deputy Manager Level at the local Agricultural Office.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Recently, Tezera became sick and was diagnosed with dual kidney failure. He receives dialysis treatment every three days at a cost of 2000 Ethiopian Birr (~$110 USD.) To put this sum in context, Ethiopia is one of the world’s poorest countries: the average Ethiopian monthly salary is $370 USD (World Bank). Tezera did not have savings, and like most Ethiopian’s relies on the monthly salary he receives from the government to support his family. <span style=""""> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Ethiopian Black Lion Hospital recommended that Tezera have a kidney transplant as a long term solution. The kidney transplant would be done at Apollo Hospital in New Delhi, India at a cost of $33,000 USD. Tezera’s younger brother, Mulat Mengesha, is willing to donate one of his kidneys. So far, dialysis costs have been covered by stretched family members, relatives, and close friends. However, it is impossible for Tezera to raise $33,000 USD for his kidney transplant. Like all of his family members and friends, we are worried and concerned that Tezera would die soon unless he gets a kidney transplant as he cannot keep up with the dialysis cost every three days.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We are a group of friends in Ethiopia and Canada who decided to try to help Tezera by fundraising through Crowdrise. Our goal is to raise $40,000 USD to cover expenses for the kidney transplant and additional expenses like transportation and accommodation, including sending his brother to India for the kidney transplant.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With the help of God and your generosity we can save Mr. Tezera’s life. Please follow the link below for your donation (whatever amount) and send the link to friends who wish to contribute. The funds raised will be transferred directly to Tezera’s bank account in Ethiopia.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On behalf of Tezera’s friends and family, we thank you for your donation from the bottom of our hearts.</p>

<h3>My name is Jennifer Swalwell Sun and<br/>I’m a licensed health coach and wellness entrepreneur. I began my career as a molecular biologist and have spent the last 13 years in medical sales and business development.<br/>

<h3>In 2009, I purchased a medical spa, <a href=""www.serenityzone.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Serenity Zone Medical Spa</a>,<br/>in Olney, Maryland and began my journey in wellness. Wellness has become my passion,but I have not had the opportunity to help my home community.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>I would like to spend 6 months helping residents of Bad Axe, Michigan by hosting health and wellness fairs,offering free corporate and community wellness seminars on healthy eating habits, and most importantly, offering one-on-one and group wellness coaching.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>This campaign is important to me because residents in my home community do not have access to wellness resources that are available in most major metropolitan areas. If they don’t have access<br/>to enough quality resources now, when will they? If it’s meant to be, it’s up to me! I will make this happen so my parents, friends, and hometown residents will have access to quality wellness education and nutritional support at a price they can all afford-FREE!!<br/>
</h3>
<h3>Contributors will help me reach an under-served community that badly needs wellness education. Adults and children will benefit from wellness education that will serve generations to come. Most<br/>importantly, we will inspire people who have lost hope about their health. We’ll educate and energize people to live healthy and vital lives rather than give up and have no hope.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>I also hope to empower and inspire members of this community to join me on my wellness crusade to create a ripple effect of wellness across the State of Michigan and across the USA. We do not have enough doctors, nurses, dietitians and health coaches to help all of the<br/>people who are in need of wellness and disease prevention education. I hope my project will serve as a success model for other health care providers and health coaches to PROVE that together, we can be healthy and have thriving communities of vital citizens.<br/>

<h3>Why NOT me?</h3>
<h3>I’ve had big dreams and goals my entire life. In high school, I had a dream to work on the Human Genome Project at the<br/>National Institutes of Health with Francis Collins (my idol). I accomplished that goal by the age of 21 and am a published scientist with Dr. Collins.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>I had a dream to own my own medical spa in a small community to deliver best in class 5-star skincare and wellness services. I’ve owned my medical spa for 4 years and it is a 5-star business (just ask Google!).</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Now is the time to reach my next goal. My goal is to continue to give back as a <a href=""http://serenityzone.com/healthcoaching"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">health coach</a> in the community where I grew up and where my parents still live. </h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Can I inspire other health coaches to return to their home towns to take on the challenge of helping their communities? Yes! Do their home towns have a name as<br/>cool as Bad Axe? Well…no, sorry. <br/>

FREE One-on-one and health coaching for up to 2500     people.
FREE Corporate Event Health Coaching for Employers
Travel and lodging expenses for myself, additional     health coaches that may be retained to meet demand, and for health fair     speakers/guests.

Why me?
Why NOT me?
I’ve had big dreams and goals my entire life. In high school, I had a dream to work on the Human Genome Project at theNational Institutes of Health with Francis Collins (my idol). I accomplished that goal by the age of 21 and am a published scientist with Dr. Collins.

I had a dream to own my own medical spa in a small community to deliver best in class 5-star skincare and wellness services. I’ve owned my medical spa for 4 years and it is a 5-star business (just ask Google!).
 
Now is the time to reach my next goal. My goal is to continue to give back as a health coach in the community where I grew up and where my parents still live. 
 
Can I inspire other health coaches to return to their home towns to take on the challenge of helping their communities? Yes! Do their home towns have a name ascool as Bad Axe? Well…no, sorry.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Deke Wright and I am an Iraq war veteran that just recently started a BBQ sauce company with my father. Let me tell you a little about how this all started. Through the years of my childhood I was blessed to have a mother that loved to cook. One of those recipes that she enjoyed making for the family and many of the friends that begged for it was our ""secret"" family BBQ sauce recipe. This amazing recipe was handed down to her from her father. He made her promise to never give the recipe away and I made the same vow to my mother. Throughout the years we always wondered and pondered over the idea of making and bottling this product to sell publicly but never took that leap. In September of 2009, my mother went to the E.R. for an emergency  appendectomy and was diagnosed with Stage 4 colon cancer. She began aggressive chemotherapy treatments and fought this cancer to the best of her ability. After only 3 months of fighting cancer she lost her battle on January 3, 2010. I have since then tried to start this company from the ground up in her memory. I plan on getting this BBQ sauce into retailers nationwide. We would also like to expand on our line of sauces and add some BBQ rubs. By doing so I also want to help raise money for the Colon Cancer Alliance and help fund my mother's memorial scholarship the Tina Wright Memorial Art Scholarship for Breckenridge, TX High School students that want to further their education in the field of Art. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div style=""""><p style="""">Our family had to learn about this cancer the hard way first hand. I want this cause to be heard nationwide. There are too many people out there that do not understand colon cancer and the steps to prevent it or survive it. You can help us in this fight and bring this to the national spotlight. Colon cancer is the second most deadly of all cancers. Colon and rectal cancer took the lives of 268,783 people between 2003 and 2007. According to the Mayo Clinic, colorectal cancer was expected to kill more than 51,000 people in 2010. My mother was one of those people. When we reach our goal I will be able to reach out to more retailers and distributors. This money will also help with my marketing and advertisement funds (as of now I am under capitalized). With my sauce making it into more stores around Texas and hopefully nationwide. Someday, I will be able to donate more and more of my profit to the Colon Cancer Alliance. I have been working with the CCA in the design of my label by adding their logo to it. I will also be able to raise the scholarship total and be able to hand out more than one scholarship yearly. By reaching this goal I will be able to expand my customer base and help bring awareness to this preventable, treatable and beatable cancer. With your help we can do this!</p></div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $15,000 to help bring this company's nose above water. I was under capitalized to begin with and this money will be used towards getting an E-Commerce website designed and launched. I will also be able to get product pictures taken professionally and ads placed online in various blogs, magazines, and print. I will also work towards expanding on this recipe to create new flavors of BBQ Sauce. If my goal is not reached I will use the money to better my company. I will fulfill all of the perks and incentives given to every contributor. Our top contributors will have the chance to help design labels and taste new sauces being developed even have the opportunity to have the sauce named after them!</p>

<h3>We are in need of your help:</h3>
<p>As many of you are already aware, the pregnacy with our first baby has been rough. In recent weeks I have had to go on moderate bedrest due to high blood pressure, early contractions and significant swelling. Because of this and the inability to walk around for more then a few hours per day, I am no longer able to work full time. We are in desperate need of help with one thing. The birth of our baby girl. Eric is working everyday to keep our bills up to date but we are finding it difficult to pay for the birth itself. The birth is going to cost $3000.00. It is very hard to ask for help in this form but here I am. Every dime will be forever appreciated.</p>

<h1>Our Project</h1>
<p>In sporting circles, its suggested that sports performance is 95% physical and 5% mental; but its the 5% mental that can cause us 95% of the problems.</p>
<p>You might have your own experiences of mental issues getting in the way of your best sporting performance. Our own personal experiences include:</p>
<ul>
<li>being super-anxious before a game</li>
<li>lacking confidence in our own ability </li>
<li>losing motivation part-way through a season </li>
<li>struggling to return to competition after a serious knee injury </li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these might be familiar to you too? Other common issues might present themselves as:</p>
<ul>
<li>missing an easy golf putt</li>
<li>displays of over-aggression on the field</li>
<li>losing focus and dropping an easy catch</li>
<li>struggling to cope with 1st team selection</li>
</ul>
<p>It is well known that sports people who develop mental skills are more successful in their chosen sport and we are building a website which will inform and assist people to deal with their mental issues and reach their full potential, no matter what sport or what level. Our site makes understanding mental skills, their benefits and their application much easier for the everyday sports person.</p>

These techniques include such things as imagery, self-talk, relaxation and goal-setting among others. They will also be able to take some online tests to help identify some of their issues and to measure success of using the techniques over time. We're presenting these website features in a light, modern and interactive way so that people can connect with the content easily and feel confident about trying out the various techniques. </p>

<h1><span>Risks and Challenges</span></h1>
<p>Any project has risks so we understand that you might be reluctant to part with your money to support us. Let's take a quick look at what could realistically go wrong:</p>
<p>- Nico and I could fall out <br/>- We might not build the site in time <br/>- It might cost us more than we've estimated to finish building the site</p>
<p>Nico and I have been friends and work colleagues for over 10 years. There are not many people we would choose to work with, so we feel that we're totally solid as a team and on the same wavelength.</p>
<p>Its well known in web development that things always take longer than planned. We've learned a lot in the past couple of years about what goes into building a site like this but with our great web developer and graphic designer we're certain and he's certain that the site can be finished within our set time frame.</p>
<p>Again, cost estimations for website builds can dramatically increase as time progresses and as plans change. However, we've nailed down exactly what needs to be done for the Alpha version launch and are sure that this funding will do the job.</p>
</div>
<h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1>
<div>
<p>If you're not in a position to make a financial pledge for the project please use the share tools to help promote our site to your friends, colleagues, co-workers and anyone you think might be interested. Alternatively you might want to drop us a line if you think there are other ways that we can find support for our project. It would be great to hear from you!</p>

Risks and Challenges
Any project has risks so we understand that you might be reluctant to part with your money to support us. Let's take a quick look at what could realistically go wrong:
- Nico and I could fall out - We might not build the site in time - It might cost us more than we've estimated to finish building the site
Nico and I have been friends and work colleagues for over 10 years. There are not many people we would choose to work with, so we feel that we're totally solid as a team and on the same wavelength.
Its well known in web development that things always take longer than planned. We've learned a lot in the past couple of years about what goes into building a site like this but with our great web developer and graphic designer we're certain and he's certain that the site can be finished within our set time frame.
Again, cost estimations for website builds can dramatically increase as time progresses and as plans change. However, we've nailed down exactly what needs to be done for the Alpha version launch and are sure that this funding will do the job.

Other Ways You Can Help

If you're not in a position to make a financial pledge for the project please use the share tools to help promote our site to your friends, colleagues, co-workers and anyone you think might be interested. Alternatively you might want to drop us a line if you think there are other ways that we can find support for our project. It would be great to hear from you!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Hyer-United</b> is a humanitarian organization with the stated mission of providing medical support to doctors and nurses in rural regions of the Republic of Artsakh where even the most basic medical supplies are unavailable. Through a partnership of a network of health professionals in the greater Los Angeles area and Armenia, we provide medical supplies to various disadvantaged regions of the Republic of Artsakh. <br/></p>
<p>The Republic of Artsakh is an independent nation in the southern Caucuses with an Armenian majority that fought and won a deadly independence war from 1988 to 1994 that cost 30,000 lives. Due to total military blockade, today its economy is largely based on aid provided by the Republic of Armenia, which itself is under heavy economic constraints. It has grave deficiencies in most basic areas of need including medicine. Though it has an incredibly strong willed population, it is also significantly dependent on organizations like ours for its continuous survival. </p>

<h2>A Brief History Of The Snagger Tool<br/>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Snagger Tool was developed in 2007 to help make handling fire hose safer and more efficient. Since then, the tool has been re-engineered to be lightweight aluminum and has been tested by numerous firefighters in a wide range of challenging situations. We have launched a crowdfunding campaign to help raise awareness and equip firefighters across the continent with this simple and effective tool.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign will allow us to train and equip many firefighters, helping to make a dangerous job safer. For individuals or organizations interested in donating $170 (cost of two tools) or more to the campaign, you can decide which city, Fire Department or individual will receive the tools you sponsored</p>
<p>With 39% of all fire fighter injuries occurring as a result of handling firehose the Snagger Tool makes the job much safer and easier. The tool is the Swiss army knife of firefighting; providing a quick and accessible solution to problems firefighters face on the ground every day. The goal of the this campaign is to provide as many Snagger Tools to Fire Departments as possible, with one being donated for every $85 raised.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">What Makes The Snagger Tool Different?</span></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>What makes the Snagger Tool valuable is its ability to handle a variety of
tasks, from handling hoses on ladders to breaking tempered glass, while being
lightweight and readily available in a pocket at all times. In doing so, the
firefighter can be prepared for multiple challenges that arise, while lowering

<h2><em><strong>Company History</strong></em></h2>

Company History
 Determined to challenge the current standard of beauty, founder, Melissa Butler dreamt up the idea of The Lip Bar after being fed up with toxic and boring makeup. So she allowed her dreams to guide her and she began studying the chemistry of cosmetics. The goal was to create a product that was for the young and savvy but also for the health conscious consumer. Founded on the idea that women can be whoever they want to be, The Lip Bar launched in 2012 releasing 12 handmade bold and bright shades that allowed women to express themselves through beauty. Filled with some of the best ingredients found in nature, The Lip Bar reinforced the fact that beauty does not have to come with the price of health. The two ideals that lay the foundation of The Lip Bar come packaged in an intricately designed and environmentally friendly package to provide our patrons with the ultimate cosmetic experience.

<p><br/></p><p></p></div>","With a mission to serve those less fortunate, and improve health conditions throughout Africa, the Medical Students Association of St. Christopher Iba Mar Diop Medical School has undertaken  a project to transform the Maternity Ward of the Philipe Maguilene Senghor Health Center  in Dakar, Senegal. Why is this project important? Childbirth in AfricaOur belief is that every woman deserves to give birth in a safe and nurturing environment.  However, too many women continue to give birth in unhygienic and stressfull conditions. Surviving childbirth is one thing, but too often women are left scarred by the traumatizing effects of their experience.  This is an aspect of maternal health that is mostly neglected yet deserves attention. Located in the suburban low-income district of Yoff, P.M.S Health Center serves over 5,000 women and newborn babies annually. It has increasingly become a key referral facilty for maternal health in Dakar, serving women within a  100km radius. It is run by a team of dedicated and highly qualified
Ob/Gyn specialists, residents, midwives and medical students who have a passion
for advancing maternal and reproductive health. Receiving little-to-no state funds, the health center struggles to meet the demands of the nearby populations in adequate health care. The maternity ward is often over-crowded (up to 20 births/day) and supplies are often lacking, leading to rough and unpleasant working condtions for patients and personnel. 
By contributing to this make-over project, you will
be radically improving the birthing experience of these brave women and their babies.  
The renovation plans include giving a new life to the delivery room, newborn station, on-call room,
consult room, and labor room: - New medical equipment and supplies- Paint and decorations- Labor assistance materialsIn addition we will be training midwives to offer pre-natal preparatory courses.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the organization will be to bring ""care packages"" to children in the hospital who are suffering from cancer.  Each care package will include a doll from The Hope Collection. These dolls are made by BRATZ and are bald, giving children without hair a beautiful doll that they can identify with.  We will also be including a children's Bible along with handmade cards from kids ranging from 1st-8th grade.  The cards will be made by a local Christian Academy and the Bibles will be donated from the publishers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have long dreamed of helping children by bringing hope and a smile to the face of one who may have no reason to smile.  When my brother passed, we found our calling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By contributing, you will be helping Ben's Buddies cover the preparation and filing costs for the 501c3, purchase the dolls, and deliver the Care Packages to local Chicago hospitals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have started this campaign to raise the money needed to prepare and file the 501c3 paperwork with the IRS; the preparation and filing costs are expected to be $2000.00.  I already have my Tax-ID, and Articles of Incorporation which have been filed in the state of Illinois. The rest of the money will go to purchase of the dolls and creation of the care packages.</p>
<p>Once we receive our non-profit status, we plan on fund raising from corporations with whom we have worked in my professional career.  Ben’s Buddies will also be holding raffles and walk-a-thons in order to raise money to purchase the dolls from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>My goal is to make Ben's Buddies our full-time endeavor.  If we do not reach my goal, I will contribute from our personal savings in order to fill whatever gap remains.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>No child deserves to be without joy or hope in desparate circumstances; while it may be a small gift, the doll, children's Bible, and cards are meant to bring a smile to the face of a child who may have no reason to smile.  The doll will be something that they can identify with (if the child has lost his/her hair through chemo) and the children's Bible tells the story of Christ and the hope He has for those who trust in Him.  The hand-made cards are a special, personal gift and can be sent to the child's home after his/her release from the hospital.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute monetarily, I would humbly ask that you pray for Ben's Buddies that we may bring joy and hope to children, that we may remain Christ-Centered, and that in all ways, God's will be done.<br/><br/> Please also feel free to share this link....we appreciate any assistance you can provide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A final note: The image of a flower is from a plant that we received shortly after Ben's passing.  The plant had never bloomed until 5/12/2012, Ben's birthday.  It is a beautiful symbol of who Ben is, the impact he's had on the world around him, and the grace of God.</p></div>","Hello, my name is James Celano and I am starting Ben's Buddies, a non-profit 501c3 organization in honor of my brother Ben.  Ben passed away at the age of 44 from colon cancer which had metastasized to his liver.  Ben fought the disease for 3 years, far longer than the doctors expected.  In the final analysis, it is believed that Ben lived so long because of the strong family and friend support network we were blessed to provide.

<i>project by TIRF Labs, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA,</i><i><br/></i><p><i> Dr. Alexander Asanov and  Dr. Luis Vaca</i><br/></p>
<h3><b>Summary</b></h3>TIRF Labs introduces cell
phone based molecular diagnostics for home use. We know that early diagnosing
saves lives, don't we? However, we are reluctant to submit ourselves for
examination because it is costly and uncomfortable. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if
you could turn your smartphone into a hospital laboratory and perform
accurate diagnosing in the comfort of y<span>our
home? Think of how that could help in monitoring the health of your family, as
well as assisting frontier doctors in preventing the spread of Ebola and other
infectious diseases. This technology has, in fact, been developed, and is named iDiagnostics</span>.<br/><br/>
<p>Medicine today is extremely imprecise and depersonalized. It treats us assuming that we all are the same. However, every one of us is truly unique. We respond differently to everything, including prescription drugs. In the USA we pay $350 billion a year on prescription drugs, but one third of them do not work, often producing toxic side effects. In the research community, it is well understood that medicine should be personalized. In other words, it should be tailored to peculiar features of the molecular machinery of our bodies. iDiagnostics is a tool which will permit medicine to become personalized and accurate, as it should be. Today, in many instances, diseases are diagnosed too late, making it difficult to reverse or prevent the threat. Technologies that allow to precisely diagnose diseases have been developed and are available in centralized clinical laboratories. However, until now using them has been too costly, often uncomfortable, and involved visiting doctors. iDiagnostics will change the situation and allow you to perform precision diagnoses in the comfort of your home. You will know the results in a matter of several minutes, and your doctor will be able to adjust the treatment remotely, without you visiting his office.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What You Will Receive?</h3>

<h3>What Will You  Change?</h3>
<p>Your support of the iDiagnostics project will change how medicine works. With iDiagnostics, you and your doctor will precisely know what is going on in your body, how your condition develops in time, and how your body responds to therapy or changes in your lifestyle. Today, there are three problems in diagnosis: (i) under-diagnosing - due to poor sensitivity of traditional tests, in which diseases often remain undetected; (ii) over-diagnosis - due to the high rate of false positive responses, the presence of a disease is erroneously reported, while, in fact, there is no threat; and (3) no-diagnosis - due to high cost and discomfort many of us prefer to avoid diagnosis. Being a sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive technology, iDiagnostics will solve all three problems. Early detection of cancer, Alzheimer's, cardio-vascular and infectious diseases, food safety, and other areas will benefit tremendously from the use of iDiagnostics. Your support will help fight these diseases.</p>
<p>Accurate and rapid diagnosis is essential for absolutely all healthcare actions. Detection of diseases, fighting cancer, heart and neurological diseases, prevention of epidemics, testing new drugs, and many other areas critically depend on accurate and rapid diagnosis. Your support will significantly accelerate progress in these areas.</p>
<p>Today, our doctors and insurance companies possess information about our health. We seldom keep the results of laboratory tests on our files, despite their importance to us in being better diagnosed in the future. For our children, who carry similar genes, the results of our diagnoses have valuable information for their health. iDiagnostics will seamlessly enable <i><b>your</b></i>ownership of information about your health. You will own the data and decide whether to email them to your doctor or save on your files. The technological opportunities for these changes have been embedded into iDiagnostics devices. Your support will help you to become the owner of information about your health.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Idea of Cell Phone Based Diagnostics</h3>
<p>Our cellphones are powerful computers equipped with super cameras. The idea behind iDiagnostics is to use them with a handheld cradle, which implements a super sensitive bio-detection fluorescence technology, called TIRF microarrays. The use of iDiagnostics is as simple as blood glucose tests available today for diabetic patients. You start the iDiagnostics app on your phone and follow the instructions. The app will instruct you to put your cellphone into the cradle, insert a cartridge, and apply a droplet of saliva, urine, sweat, blood, or other bodily fluid. The fluid will flow inside the cartridge over the TIRF microarray; which will detect the presence or absence of numerous molecular markers. Massive amounts of information will be obtained by taking pictures of the response of the TIRF microarray. The iDiagnostics app will analyze the images<i>,</i> and<i>,</i> in a matter of several minutes<i>,</i> will provide recommendations on what to do. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How Does iDiagnostics Work?</h3>
<p>iDiagnostics is a technology which detects multiple molecular markers in a droplet of saliva, urine, sweat, blood, stool, or other bodily fluid. It is designed to be minimally invasive and maximally precise. Molecular markers are signatures of diseases. They appear in biological fluids several months before a cancer tumor develops, and at least several weeks before a heart attack strikes, giving us enough time to prevent the threat<i>.</i> iDiagnostics employs super sensitive technology, termed silk-enhanced TIRF microarray, to detect molecular markers. Theoretically, thousands of bioassays can be included into a TIRF microarray. However, in most practical cases we do not need more than 20 markers to perform a test with negligibly small rate of errors. TIRF microarrays are capable of detecting markers of three major classes: proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. Traditional tests are based on a single class of markers and are often too imprecise. </p>
<p>Figure 3 shows a photo and the schematics of <i>i</i>Diagnostics. The cradle and cartridge integrate optics, microfluidics, an electrochemical system, electronics, and nanoengineered bioassays into one handheld device, which implements TIRF microarray technology. </p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Figure 3. Photo and schematics of iDiagnostics."" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/984/212/3e55ac293f895be2287ae93294ea6139_large.jpg?1417237215"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Figure 3. Photo and schematics of iDiagnostics.</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>iDiagnostics is based on the phenomenon of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) (Figure 4), which occurs at the interface between a plastic or glass slide and biological fluid. If the fluorescence excitation light enters the slide at angles of 63 degrees or larger, the light will bounce from the top and the bottom of the slide and excite fluorescence of multiple bioassay spots that are arrayed at the bottom surface of the slide, where the bodily fluid contacts the array. </p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Figure 4. Silk-enhanced TIRF microarray in comparison with classical TIRF microarray."" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/984/046/3f5e68efc03c9ea7714ba1d2107f7ce8_large.jpg?1417232042"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Figure 4. Silk-enhanced TIRF microarray in comparison with classical TIRF microarray.</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>Because TIRF is a surface-selective technique, which probes only a sub-micron layer of the fluid,  bioassays that are immobilized at the surface are excited and fluoresce, while molecules and other particles in the bulk of solution are not excited, and respectively, do not fluoresce. This allows for the testing of complex biological fluids, such as whole blood, with no or minimal sample preparation, which drastically reduces the turn-around time between the moments ""sample-in"" and  ""result-out."" </p>
<p>A classical TIRF array, which is shown at the bottom of Figure 4, can use only a sub-micron layer of bioassays. Therefore, the fluorescence signal of classical arrays is low; expensive scientific-grade cameras are necessary to image them. In 2013, after experimenting with a multitude of materials, we discovered that silk fibroin, the same natural protein that spiders use for their webs, tremendously enhances the signal of TIRF arrays. Silk fibroin is one of the few natural proteins whose refractive index is close to that of glass. This property is responsible for the beautiful shimmering of silk fibers in clothing. If deposited onto a glass or plastic slide, silk fibroin captures the excitation light, becomes an integral part of TIRF lightguide, and allows for an increase in the amount of immobilized bioassay molecules by a thousand-fold. Silk-enhanced TIRF arrays fluoresce brightly; cell phone cameras are sensitive enough to detect their response. Additionally, silk is a remarkably stable protein. Its shelf life extends to several months and even years. Silk also stabilizes other biological molecules that otherwise would require refrigeration, a quality very desirable for applications in low resource settings.</p>

<p>For the detection of DNA and RNA markers, iDiagnostics uses bioassays, termed <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_beacon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">molecular beacons</a></i>. In the absence of target DNA or RNA, the fluorescence of a molecular beacon is quenched. The left panel of Figure 5 illustrates that upon binding to target DNA or RNA the molecular beacon opens and its fluorescence is dequenched. Irrelevant, non-target DNA or RNA do not open the molecular beacon; its fluorescence remains quenched. For the detection of protein and metabolite markers, iDiagnostics employs <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoassay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">immunoassays</a></i> based on antibodies, as shown on the right panel of Figure 5.

<p></p>
<h3>How iDiagnostics Was Born?</h3>
<p>iDiagnostics is the result of a 9-year effort by our group of scientists and engineers. We have received $4.3 million in grants from the U.S. government and have developed a super-sensitive technology - TIRF microarrays. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection_fluorescence_microscope"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TIRF </a>is an exceptionally sensitive technology capable of detecting biological particles down to single molecules. In iDiagnostics<i>,</i> TIRF allows for super-sensitive detection of proteins, DNA, RNA, metabolites, and selected chemical agents. The sensitivity and dynamic range of iDiagnostics is sufficient for detecting virtually all clinically significant protein, RNA, DNA, and metabolite markers. Figure 6 shows our progress in the development of TIRF array biosensors, which spanned from large bench-top instruments created in 2005, through portable sensors produced in 2009, to small handheld devices built in 2011. </p>
<div>

Downsizing TIRF microarray biosensors.</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>In 2013, as mentioned above, we discovered that silk fibroin enhances the fluorescence of TIRF microarrays so that we can use a cellphone camera instead of expensive cameras. This patent-pending discovery has been incorporated into iDiagnostics.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>iDiagnostics Applications</h3>
<p>Applications for <i>i</i>Diagnostics include diagnosing and prognosing  cancer, cardio-vascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, influenza, Ebola and other infectious diseases, food safety, biodefense, forensic, environmental, and agricultural analyses. Along with the main goal of home use, family doctors, cardiologists, dentists, first responders, pharmaceutical companies, food safety, agriculture, and environment protection specialists have expressed their interest in using iDiagnostics for their applications. There are thousands of tests that can be developed for the iDiagnostics platform. For a single company it is too difficult, if not impossible, to develop all these numerous applications. Therefore, we invite other research groups worldwide to join our virtual team to interface their existing tests with the iDiagnostics platform and to develop new tests. To facilitate these efforts, we will supply the iDiagnostics Application Development Kit (ADK) shown in Figure 2. An ADK contains all necessary components for the development of diagnostics applications, including hardware, software, development tools, cartridge blanks, reagents, experimental protocols, and description of methods necessary for development. </p>
<p>In our laboratory in North Carolina we are finishing the development of diagnostic and prognostic tests for breast and prostate cancer. We have developed iDiagnostics tests for food safety and detecting allergens in food. Our long-term collaborator Dr. Vaca from the Institute of Cellular Physiology at UNAM and his group are developing tests for early diagnosing of Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C. His colleagues from other research groups will develop tests for pancreatic and colon cancer. Dr. Dong from Washington State University is developing iDiagnostics tests for cardio-diseases. The Laboratory of Molecular Virology at the Food and Drug Administration expressed their interest in using iDiagnostics for rapid detection of HIV and other infectious diseases. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of other exciting applications that will be totally new for the healthcare area. In our laboratory in North Carolina we are working  on the longevity tests. These studies are promising rapid progress in the increasing of longevity and preventing metabolic disbalances that result in premature aging. </p>
<p>Personalized medicine, clinical and pre-clinical tests of new drugs, disease risks assessment, food and water safety, detection of allergens, environmental and agricultural applications will benefit tremendously from iDiagnostics.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>How iDiagnostics Compares with Alternative Technologies?</b></h3>


We have
carefully examined the multitude of alternative methods and found that
iDiagnostics is a superior technology for home use diagnostics. To the best of
our knowledge, iDiagnostics is the only technology which is accurate and
rapid, yet can be downsized to an inexpensive handheld device. The projected
cost of iDiagnostics is $400, and disposable cartridges are anticipated to cost
$1-3. We are not aware of other technologies that could be as sensitive,
accurate, rapid, and yet be as affordable as iDiagnostics.

<br/>After 9-11 followed by the anthrax letter attacks, the U.S. government invested over $70 billion in bio-defense. There is no analytical technique that has not been tried for bio-detection. However, most of the techniques are too imprecise or too costly. The Department of Defense is monitoring existing and emerging technologies that can be used for protection of the U.S. soldiers against biological warfare agents. In 2013 DOD issued a 663-page document (<a href=""http://www.cbrnhorizonscan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cbrnhorizonscan.com), </a>which  ranked our classical TIRF array biosensors among the most promising devices that are well-suited for military applications. We performed further analysis from the standpoint of civil applications and compared iDiagnostics with alternative technologies that theoretically could be employed for home use. We found that iDiagnostics showed several superior advantages, including (i) the low limit of detection and high sensitivity sufficient for detection of virtually all clinically significant markers, (ii) the broad dynamic range, which covers the entire spectrum of bio-marker concentrations that are clinically significant for diagnosis of diseases, (iii) the capability to simultaneously detect three classes of markers: proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. To the best of our knowledge, iDiagnostics is the only technology which is capable of providing precision and rapid molecular diagnosis at affordable cost. <p></p>

<h3>TIRF Labs Team</h3>
<p>The following scientists and engineers have contributed significantly
 to the development of TIRF microarray and iDiagnostics technologies: 
Luis Vaca, Ph.D.; Vladimir Omelyanenko, Ph.D.; Angelica Zepeda, Ph.D.; 
Alicia Sampieri, Ph.D.; Philip Oldham, Ph.D.; W. William Wilson, 
Ph.D.; Theodore Winger, Ph.D.; David Sachs, M.S.; Hardie Johnson, B.A.; 
David Landis, Ph.D.; Ryan Sherry, M.S.; Tyson Weiss, B.A.; Zhanna 
Brotsman, M.S., Grant Leonhard, Timothy Pike, and Alexander Asanov, 
Ph.D.</p>
<h3>Personal Statement of Lead Scientist</h3>
<p>I, Alexander Asanov, believe that I am well-suited to lead the 
iDiagnostics project. This project logically builds upon my prior work. 
In 2004-2012, I served as Principal Investigator on several BAA and SBIR
 grants, awarded by NIH and HSARPA. I assembled and led a team of 
scientists and engineers, who have developed a family of innovative TIRF
 instruments for molecular diagnostics. My colleagues and I have 
pioneered several ground-breaking discoveries and accumulated unique 
experience in using TIRF technology for life-science applications.  I 
have a broad background in spectroscopy, electrochemistry, surface 
chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, nanoengineering, mechanical 
engineering, and optical engineering, which are key areas for this 
project. Each of our prior projects resulted in the development of 
useful TIRF instruments. Our customers from academic and pharmaceutical 
research groups have generated unique research data using our products, 
and have published articles in leading scientific journals. I have a 
record of successful R&amp;D projects in the area of molecular 
diagnostics and believe that my prior experiences have prepared me well 
to lead the proposed project.  I am a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 1994,
 I immigrated from Russia. Although I still speak with an accent, I feel
 that I am more American than Russian. My second Motherland recognized 
my accomplishments and rewarded me more than I could have dreamt of in 
Russia. I want to give back to society and believe that the development 
of iDiagnostics is the way in which I can demonstrate my gratitude to 
America and the world.<br/>
</p>
<h3>Open Innovation Approach</h3>
<p>In order to make accurate diagnostics available to everyone, we are using an open innovation approach, which involves collaborative efforts with other research groups. We have successfully collaborated with several groups worldwide and plan extended collaboration to better meet the broad spectrum of needs of our customers. Several of our products, including iDiagnostics, have been inspired by our customers and collaborators. iDiagnostics has been developed in collaboration with one of our long-term partners - research group of Dr. Vaca from UNAM. We plan to further extend this approach because we believe that knowledge in the field of life sciences is broadly distributed. Innovations and efficient transfer of them to the market place assumes close collaboration with external research groups. To stimulate the flow of innovations in and out of our company, we will offer to license the intellectual property of our collaborators and will offer them the opportunity to license our technologies.</p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to make accurate diagnosing affordable for all. Rather than selling iDiagnostics to a big-name company,  we are turning to you on Indiegogo for funding, so that we can guarantee affordable access to this life-saving technology for you and every family around the globe. </p>
<p>It appears that acquisition of iDiagnostics technology by a large firm would produce too costly diagnostic system, which the majority of population would not be able to afford.  Indeed, the goal of large firms is to generate maximum income for their shareholders. It would be against their rules to sell iDiagnostics at a price that is significantly lower than the current market price for similar systems. </p>
<p>The involvement of venture capital firms appears to be even less efficient than the possible acquisition of iDiagnostics by a large firm. Unfortunately, the rate of success for a typical venture capital firm is less than 5%, meaning that just one company, which is successful, should cover losses incurred by 19 unsuccessful startups that did not make it to the market.</p>
<p>Valley of Death - is the term that the business development community uses to designate the dramatic period of time that occurs between creating a prototype and manufacturing the product. Indeed, many nice technologies have paved the road of the Valley of Death, because they did not get funds to make the transition to manufacturing. Crowdfunding is a new mechanism, which is changing the game. On Indiegogo you, using your hard-earned dollar, are voting for an innovation, which you want to see in your hands. We believe that iDiagnostics is one such innovation. It will have enormous social impact, save millions of lives, and overall improve healthcare for everyone around the globe. We hope that you will join us. It will be more than just a new technology. There also will be a new community, which will work together to efficiently improve the quality of healthcare.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>Neither human subjects nor laboratory animals are involved in this project. Genetically modified organisms and biologically hazardous materials aren't used either. Our collaborators, who do perform regulated studies, comply with the respective government protocols and rules. </p>
<p>The field of life-sciences, in general, and the area of molecular biology, in particular, operate with powerful technologies that are improving the quality of our lives. However, these powerful tools, if used improperly, can cause adverse effects.  We believe that scientists should be responsible for the results of their studies. It is our company policy and the responsibility of our workers to foresee the possible adverse effects of our studies and adhere to the highest ethical standards to avoid possible adverse effects. We do not develop and do not support the development of controversial biological applications.  </p>

</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>TIRF Labs has been working on molecular diagnostics for the last ten years and has created a family of TIRF instruments, including bench-top, portable, and handheld TIRF biosensors. We have assembled a group of scientists and engineers with vast experience in all relevant fields. However, a project of such scale as iDiagnostics involves new risks. The research and development have worked, the prototyping and low-volume manufacturing has been done. Now, the risks are associated with the transition from prototyping and low-volume manufacturing to mass production. To mitigate these risks, we are establishing parallel contacts with alternative manufacturing partners and collaborators to assure multiple possible channels for production. If a setback does arise in one of the channels, we will use an alternative channel. iDiagnostics is a sophisticated technology. We are using a number of unique methods and production technologies. We believe that we are able to foresee and minimize risks associated with these methods in order to deliver iDiagnostics to our backers with full satisfaction. Keeping our customers and backers updated about our progress and receiving feedback from them is our priority. If there are unexpected issues or delays, we will inform you promptly.</p> <div>

project by TIRF Labs, Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA, Dr. Alexander Asanov and  Dr. Luis Vaca
SummaryTIRF Labs introduces cell
phone based molecular diagnostics for home use. We know that early diagnosing
saves lives, don't we? However, we are reluctant to submit ourselves for
examination because it is costly and uncomfortable. Wouldn’t it be wonderful if
you could turn your smartphone into a hospital laboratory and perform
accurate diagnosing in the comfort of your
home? Think of how that could help in monitoring the health of your family, as
well as assisting frontier doctors in preventing the spread of Ebola and other
infectious diseases. This technology has, in fact, been developed, and is named iDiagnostics.
Medicine today is extremely imprecise and depersonalized. It treats us assuming that we all are the same. However, every one of us is truly unique. We respond differently to everything, including prescription drugs. In the USA we pay $350 billion a year on prescription drugs, but one third of them do not work, often producing toxic side effects. In the research community, it is well understood that medicine should be personalized. In other words, it should be tailored to peculiar features of the molecular machinery of our bodies. iDiagnostics is a tool which will permit medicine to become personalized and accurate, as it should be. Today, in many instances, diseases are diagnosed too late, making it difficult to reverse or prevent the threat. Technologies that allow to precisely diagnose diseases have been developed and are available in centralized clinical laboratories. However, until now using them has been too costly, often uncomfortable, and involved visiting doctors. iDiagnostics will change the situation and allow you to perform precision diagnoses in the comfort of your home. You will know the results in a matter of several minutes, and your doctor will be able to adjust the treatment remotely, without you visiting his office.

What You Will Receive?
This project will result in two main products:
(i) iDiagnostics and test cartridges, shown in Figure 1, and
Figure 1. iDiagnostics cradle with cell phone and cartridges for home use molecular diagnostic tests.
(ii) Application Development Kit  (ADK) shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. iDiagnostics Application Development Kit (ADK). For more information please visit www.i-diagnostics.net.
  
(i) iDiagnostics and disposable cartridges, shown in Figure 1, are designed for home use by everyone. They also can be used by medical doctors, first responders, clinical researchers, and other specialists. We anticipate that by October 2015 several tests, including food safety, allergens in food, prostate and breast cancer, will be approved by regulating agencies and available to our backers. Our adopter-pledgers will receive an iDiagnostics cradle with several cartridges from the list of approved tests. Major models of Android, Windows, and iPhone will be supported; please specify your model at the moment of pledging. Our adopter-pledgers will also receive several free cartridges that our collaborators and we will develop during the next two years. Each of our pledgers will have the opportunity to become a member of the home diagnostics community, which will help to develop new tests and make existing tests more accurate.
  (ii) ADK (Application Development Kit), shown in Figure 2, is intended for researchers who are interested in interfacing their existing tests and developing new applications for iDiagnostics. Our pledgers who support ADK products will receive ADK at special Indiegogo price and also will have the opportunity to sponsor a university student project, which will use the ADK for the development of molecular diagnostics tests. If you do not have a student in mind, but are willing to sponsor one, we will be delighted to assist you in allocating a bright student and an exciting goal.






What Will You  Change?
Your support of the iDiagnostics project will change how medicine works. With iDiagnostics, you and your doctor will precisely know what is going on in your body, how your condition develops in time, and how your body responds to therapy or changes in your lifestyle. Today, there are three problems in diagnosis: (i) under-diagnosing - due to poor sensitivity of traditional tests, in which diseases often remain undetected; (ii) over-diagnosis - due to the high rate of false positive responses, the presence of a disease is erroneously reported, while, in fact, there is no threat; and (3) no-diagnosis - due to high cost and discomfort many of us prefer to avoid diagnosis. Being a sensitive, accurate, and inexpensive technology, iDiagnostics will solve all three problems. Early detection of cancer, Alzheimer's, cardio-vascular and infectious diseases, food safety, and other areas will benefit tremendously from the use of iDiagnostics. Your support will help fight these diseases.
Accurate and rapid diagnosis is essential for absolutely all healthcare actions. Detection of diseases, fighting cancer, heart and neurological diseases, prevention of epidemics, testing new drugs, and many other areas critically depend on accurate and rapid diagnosis. Your support will significantly accelerate progress in these areas.
Today, our doctors and insurance companies possess information about our health. We seldom keep the results of laboratory tests on our files, despite their importance to us in being better diagnosed in the future. For our children, who carry similar genes, the results of our diagnoses have valuable information for their health. iDiagnostics will seamlessly enable yourownership of information about your health. You will own the data and decide whether to email them to your doctor or save on your files. The technological opportunities for these changes have been embedded into iDiagnostics devices. Your support will help you to become the owner of information about your health.

Idea of Cell Phone Based Diagnostics
Our cellphones are powerful computers equipped with super cameras. The idea behind iDiagnostics is to use them with a handheld cradle, which implements a super sensitive bio-detection fluorescence technology, called TIRF microarrays. The use of iDiagnostics is as simple as blood glucose tests available today for diabetic patients. You start the iDiagnostics app on your phone and follow the instructions. The app will instruct you to put your cellphone into the cradle, insert a cartridge, and apply a droplet of saliva, urine, sweat, blood, or other bodily fluid. The fluid will flow inside the cartridge over the TIRF microarray; which will detect the presence or absence of numerous molecular markers. Massive amounts of information will be obtained by taking pictures of the response of the TIRF microarray. The iDiagnostics app will analyze the images, and, in a matter of several minutes, will provide recommendations on what to do. 

How Does iDiagnostics Work?
iDiagnostics is a technology which detects multiple molecular markers in a droplet of saliva, urine, sweat, blood, stool, or other bodily fluid. It is designed to be minimally invasive and maximally precise. Molecular markers are signatures of diseases. They appear in biological fluids several months before a cancer tumor develops, and at least several weeks before a heart attack strikes, giving us enough time to prevent the threat. iDiagnostics employs super sensitive technology, termed silk-enhanced TIRF microarray, to detect molecular markers. Theoretically, thousands of bioassays can be included into a TIRF microarray. However, in most practical cases we do not need more than 20 markers to perform a test with negligibly small rate of errors. TIRF microarrays are capable of detecting markers of three major classes: proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. Traditional tests are based on a single class of markers and are often too imprecise. 
Figure 3 shows a photo and the schematics of iDiagnostics. The cradle and cartridge integrate optics, microfluidics, an electrochemical system, electronics, and nanoengineered bioassays into one handheld device, which implements TIRF microarray technology. 

Figure 3. Photo and schematics of iDiagnostics.
iDiagnostics is based on the phenomenon of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) (Figure 4), which occurs at the interface between a plastic or glass slide and biological fluid. If the fluorescence excitation light enters the slide at angles of 63 degrees or larger, the light will bounce from the top and the bottom of the slide and excite fluorescence of multiple bioassay spots that are arrayed at the bottom surface of the slide, where the bodily fluid contacts the array. 

Figure 4. Silk-enhanced TIRF microarray in comparison with classical TIRF microarray.
Because TIRF is a surface-selective technique, which probes only a sub-micron layer of the fluid,  bioassays that are immobilized at the surface are excited and fluoresce, while molecules and other particles in the bulk of solution are not excited, and respectively, do not fluoresce. This allows for the testing of complex biological fluids, such as whole blood, with no or minimal sample preparation, which drastically reduces the turn-around time between the moments ""sample-in"" and  ""result-out."" 
A classical TIRF array, which is shown at the bottom of Figure 4, can use only a sub-micron layer of bioassays. Therefore, the fluorescence signal of classical arrays is low; expensive scientific-grade cameras are necessary to image them. In 2013, after experimenting with a multitude of materials, we discovered that silk fibroin, the same natural protein that spiders use for their webs, tremendously enhances the signal of TIRF arrays. Silk fibroin is one of the few natural proteins whose refractive index is close to that of glass. This property is responsible for the beautiful shimmering of silk fibers in clothing. If deposited onto a glass or plastic slide, silk fibroin captures the excitation light, becomes an integral part of TIRF lightguide, and allows for an increase in the amount of immobilized bioassay molecules by a thousand-fold. Silk-enhanced TIRF arrays fluoresce brightly; cell phone cameras are sensitive enough to detect their response. Additionally, silk is a remarkably stable protein. Its shelf life extends to several months and even years. Silk also stabilizes other biological molecules that otherwise would require refrigeration, a quality very desirable for applications in low resource settings.

Figure 5. Molecular beacon assay for detection of DNA and RNA markers and immunoassay for detection of protein markers.
For the detection of DNA and RNA markers, iDiagnostics uses bioassays, termed molecular beacons. In the absence of target DNA or RNA, the fluorescence of a molecular beacon is quenched. The left panel of Figure 5 illustrates that upon binding to target DNA or RNA the molecular beacon opens and its fluorescence is dequenched. Irrelevant, non-target DNA or RNA do not open the molecular beacon; its fluorescence remains quenched. For the detection of protein and metabolite markers, iDiagnostics employs immunoassays based on antibodies, as shown on the right panel of Figure 5.

iDiagnostics Technical Specifications



How iDiagnostics Was Born?
iDiagnostics is the result of a 9-year effort by our group of scientists and engineers. We have received $4.3 million in grants from the U.S. government and have developed a super-sensitive technology - TIRF microarrays. TIRF is an exceptionally sensitive technology capable of detecting biological particles down to single molecules. In iDiagnostics, TIRF allows for super-sensitive detection of proteins, DNA, RNA, metabolites, and selected chemical agents. The sensitivity and dynamic range of iDiagnostics is sufficient for detecting virtually all clinically significant protein, RNA, DNA, and metabolite markers. Figure 6 shows our progress in the development of TIRF array biosensors, which spanned from large bench-top instruments created in 2005, through portable sensors produced in 2009, to small handheld devices built in 2011. 

Figure 6. Downsizing TIRF microarray biosensors.
In 2013, as mentioned above, we discovered that silk fibroin enhances the fluorescence of TIRF microarrays so that we can use a cellphone camera instead of expensive cameras. This patent-pending discovery has been incorporated into iDiagnostics.

iDiagnostics Applications
Applications for iDiagnostics include diagnosing and prognosing  cancer, cardio-vascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders, influenza, Ebola and other infectious diseases, food safety, biodefense, forensic, environmental, and agricultural analyses. Along with the main goal of home use, family doctors, cardiologists, dentists, first responders, pharmaceutical companies, food safety, agriculture, and environment protection specialists have expressed their interest in using iDiagnostics for their applications. There are thousands of tests that can be developed for the iDiagnostics platform. For a single company it is too difficult, if not impossible, to develop all these numerous applications. Therefore, we invite other research groups worldwide to join our virtual team to interface their existing tests with the iDiagnostics platform and to develop new tests. To facilitate these efforts, we will supply the iDiagnostics Application Development Kit (ADK) shown in Figure 2. An ADK contains all necessary components for the development of diagnostics applications, including hardware, software, development tools, cartridge blanks, reagents, experimental protocols, and description of methods necessary for development. 
In our laboratory in North Carolina we are finishing the development of diagnostic and prognostic tests for breast and prostate cancer. We have developed iDiagnostics tests for food safety and detecting allergens in food. Our long-term collaborator Dr. Vaca from the Institute of Cellular Physiology at UNAM and his group are developing tests for early diagnosing of Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C. His colleagues from other research groups will develop tests for pancreatic and colon cancer. Dr. Dong from Washington State University is developing iDiagnostics tests for cardio-diseases. The Laboratory of Molecular Virology at the Food and Drug Administration expressed their interest in using iDiagnostics for rapid detection of HIV and other infectious diseases. 
There are hundreds of other exciting applications that will be totally new for the healthcare area. In our laboratory in North Carolina we are working  on the longevity tests. These studies are promising rapid progress in the increasing of longevity and preventing metabolic disbalances that result in premature aging. 
Personalized medicine, clinical and pre-clinical tests of new drugs, disease risks assessment, food and water safety, detection of allergens, environmental and agricultural applications will benefit tremendously from iDiagnostics.

How iDiagnostics Compares with Alternative Technologies?


We have
carefully examined the multitude of alternative methods and found that
iDiagnostics is a superior technology for home use diagnostics. To the best of
our knowledge, iDiagnostics is the only technology which is accurate and
rapid, yet can be downsized to an inexpensive handheld device. The projected
cost of iDiagnostics is $400, and disposable cartridges are anticipated to cost
$1-3. We are not aware of other technologies that could be as sensitive,
accurate, rapid, and yet be as affordable as iDiagnostics.

After 9-11 followed by the anthrax letter attacks, the U.S. government invested over $70 billion in bio-defense. There is no analytical technique that has not been tried for bio-detection. However, most of the techniques are too imprecise or too costly. The Department of Defense is monitoring existing and emerging technologies that can be used for protection of the U.S. soldiers against biological warfare agents. In 2013 DOD issued a 663-page document (www.cbrnhorizonscan.com), which  ranked our classical TIRF array biosensors among the most promising devices that are well-suited for military applications. We performed further analysis from the standpoint of civil applications and compared iDiagnostics with alternative technologies that theoretically could be employed for home use. We found that iDiagnostics showed several superior advantages, including (i) the low limit of detection and high sensitivity sufficient for detection of virtually all clinically significant markers, (ii) the broad dynamic range, which covers the entire spectrum of bio-marker concentrations that are clinically significant for diagnosis of diseases, (iii) the capability to simultaneously detect three classes of markers: proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites. To the best of our knowledge, iDiagnostics is the only technology which is capable of providing precision and rapid molecular diagnosis at affordable cost.

Personal Statement of Lead Scientist
I, Alexander Asanov, believe that I am well-suited to lead the 
iDiagnostics project. This project logically builds upon my prior work. 
In 2004-2012, I served as Principal Investigator on several BAA and SBIR
 grants, awarded by NIH and HSARPA. I assembled and led a team of 
scientists and engineers, who have developed a family of innovative TIRF
 instruments for molecular diagnostics. My colleagues and I have 
pioneered several ground-breaking discoveries and accumulated unique 
experience in using TIRF technology for life-science applications.  I 
have a broad background in spectroscopy, electrochemistry, surface 
chemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, nanoengineering, mechanical 
engineering, and optical engineering, which are key areas for this 
project. Each of our prior projects resulted in the development of 
useful TIRF instruments. Our customers from academic and pharmaceutical 
research groups have generated unique research data using our products, 
and have published articles in leading scientific journals. I have a 
record of successful R&D projects in the area of molecular 
diagnostics and believe that my prior experiences have prepared me well 
to lead the proposed project.  I am a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 1994,
 I immigrated from Russia. Although I still speak with an accent, I feel
 that I am more American than Russian. My second Motherland recognized 
my accomplishments and rewarded me more than I could have dreamt of in 
Russia. I want to give back to society and believe that the development 
of iDiagnostics is the way in which I can demonstrate my gratitude to 
America and the world.

Open Innovation Approach
In order to make accurate diagnostics available to everyone, we are using an open innovation approach, which involves collaborative efforts with other research groups. We have successfully collaborated with several groups worldwide and plan extended collaboration to better meet the broad spectrum of needs of our customers. Several of our products, including iDiagnostics, have been inspired by our customers and collaborators. iDiagnostics has been developed in collaboration with one of our long-term partners - research group of Dr. Vaca from UNAM. We plan to further extend this approach because we believe that knowledge in the field of life sciences is broadly distributed. Innovations and efficient transfer of them to the market place assumes close collaboration with external research groups. To stimulate the flow of innovations in and out of our company, we will offer to license the intellectual property of our collaborators and will offer them the opportunity to license our technologies.
Why Indiegogo?
Our goal is to make accurate diagnosing affordable for all. Rather than selling iDiagnostics to a big-name company,  we are turning to you on Indiegogo for funding, so that we can guarantee affordable access to this life-saving technology for you and every family around the globe. 
It appears that acquisition of iDiagnostics technology by a large firm would produce too costly diagnostic system, which the majority of population would not be able to afford.  Indeed, the goal of large firms is to generate maximum income for their shareholders. It would be against their rules to sell iDiagnostics at a price that is significantly lower than the current market price for similar systems. 
The involvement of venture capital firms appears to be even less efficient than the possible acquisition of iDiagnostics by a large firm. Unfortunately, the rate of success for a typical venture capital firm is less than 5%, meaning that just one company, which is successful, should cover losses incurred by 19 unsuccessful startups that did not make it to the market.
Valley of Death - is the term that the business development community uses to designate the dramatic period of time that occurs between creating a prototype and manufacturing the product. Indeed, many nice technologies have paved the road of the Valley of Death, because they did not get funds to make the transition to manufacturing. Crowdfunding is a new mechanism, which is changing the game. On Indiegogo you, using your hard-earned dollar, are voting for an innovation, which you want to see in your hands. We believe that iDiagnostics is one such innovation. It will have enormous social impact, save millions of lives, and overall improve healthcare for everyone around the globe. We hope that you will join us. It will be more than just a new technology. There also will be a new community, which will work together to efficiently improve the quality of healthcare.

Risks and challengesTIRF Labs has been working on molecular diagnostics for the last ten years and has created a family of TIRF instruments, including bench-top, portable, and handheld TIRF biosensors. We have assembled a group of scientists and engineers with vast experience in all relevant fields. However, a project of such scale as iDiagnostics involves new risks. The research and development have worked, the prototyping and low-volume manufacturing has been done. Now, the risks are associated with the transition from prototyping and low-volume manufacturing to mass production. To mitigate these risks, we are establishing parallel contacts with alternative manufacturing partners and collaborators to assure multiple possible channels for production. If a setback does arise in one of the channels, we will use an alternative channel. iDiagnostics is a sophisticated technology. We are using a number of unique methods and production technologies. We believe that we are able to foresee and minimize risks associated with these methods in order to deliver iDiagnostics to our backers with full satisfaction. Keeping our customers and backers updated about our progress and receiving feedback from them is our priority. If there are unexpected issues or delays, we will inform you promptly.

</div></div>","Traditionally the stethoscope was only used by doctors for auscultation - listening to the sounds of the body for medical diagnosis. But tools such as this can let us experience so much more. There are so many internal sounds existing but seldom be noticed: The sound of body, animals, plants etc. These rhythms of the world around us can surprise and delight you.So we made Stemoscope, an advanced wireless stethoscope that is small, compact, affordable and easy enough for anyone to use. It has a feature-rich App that lets you feel, share and explore the sounds of life.  Hands On Review Watch this Stemoscope Review video by Dr. Carllo Oller on his Youtube Channel DrER.tv to find out the difference between Stemoscope and other Stethoscopes.   
There is another review video by Ollie Burton on his Youtube Channel PostGradMedic. He is a medical student and also one of our crowdfunding backers. He did the review after he received the Stemoscope. 
 
Stemoscope is a very compact device which can detect the sounds and send the signals to your smartphone via Bluetooth. You can hear the sounds with your earphone or headset connected with your smartphone. Here are some sound samples recorded by Stemoscope. Please wear your ? to listen to them.   

The Sound of Human Life

 
The Sound of Puppy’s Heartbeat

 


 


The Sound of Tree


 

 
Stemoscope is powered by a full-featured APP, for iOS and Android. It lets you discover and record the incredible sounds that exist all around us. Listening with Stemoscope reveals a new and expansive world. The sounds can be visualized, saved and shared conveniently

<h2>160 MILLION PETS <u><i>CANNOT</i></u>  BE WRONG!!</h2>
</div><div>
<p>My name is Dr. Salvatore DeRicco, and 160 million is how many – of the estimated 200 million dogs and cats – in the USA, alone, have <strong>PERIODONTAL (GUM) DISEASE</strong>.  And, according to the American Veterinary Dental College, “periodontal disease is the most commonly occurring clinical condition occurring in adult dogs and cats, and is entirely preventable”.  And clear evidence exists of links between periodontal disease and heart, liver, lung, kidney and pregnancy diseases; diabetes; and <i>even </i> tumors! </p>
<p>The History is that I am an orthodontist and invented a<i> great</i>  new toothbrush for braces – The SPOT LESS BRUSH (<a href=""http://www.SpotLessBrush.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.SpotLessBrush.com</a>) - which many orthodontists and orthodontic patients have reported that they<i> also</i> like using for their<i> pets</i>, since it has such a <i>small</i>  head size and only <i>one</i> single row of shorter-than-average bristles.  So, I consulted with hundreds of Veterinarians and Veterinary Technicians - over the past year, and learned that many pet owners do <i>not </i> brush their pets’ teeth, and the reasons why, so I’ve now invented <strong>The GUMLINERS</strong> (<a href=""http://www.HealthierPetsNow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.HealthierPetsNow.com</a>) – for pets, to make oral care<i> easier</i>  for pet and owner alike, and more <i>effective</i> - in the effort to prevent periodontal disease and the associated bodily/organ diseases that it can lead to, which I refer to – collectively, as <strong>“PETiodontal Diseases”</strong>,<strong> </strong>(since they begin with <i>periodontal </i> disease), by just “SWEEPING their GUMLINES”, regularly!  You see, unlike you and me, it's <i>very</i>  uncommon for dogs and cats to get cavities, so the existing pet toothbrushes are often considered LARGER than necessary, for pet oral care, and present difficulty in<i> predictably </i> fitting all around the gumline, and, thereby targeting the<i> primary</i>  zone that counts.  And, unlike yours and mine, pets' teeth vary <i>dramatically </i> in height - much like a <i>city skyline</i>, but the gumline is uniform and can provide a convenient ""track"" to guide your efforts - much like the street or sidewalk, at the base of that skyline.  Finally, unlike you and me, only the gumline on the <i>outer</i>  (lip and cheek) sides of the teeth needs to be brushed - the tongue's activity cleanses the tongue sides of the teeth, effectively.  That's what makes brushing <i>easier </i> and <i>quicker </i> for owners (i.e. before you <i>both </i> get frustrated) and more <i>effective</i>  and <i>tolerable</i>  for your pet(s).  And to take it further, numerous Veterinarians complained about the fact that no toothbrush exists for dogs' upper molars, which curve inward - towards the palate, and despite that being among the areas where the <i>highest </i> incidence of periodontal (gum) disease occurs!  That's why we built the compound bends into one end of our brush heads.</p>
<p>So, together, let’s get <strong>“SWEEP the GUMLINE”</strong> to start <strong>sweeping the NATION!!  </strong>And let's have a Nation of<strong> 160 million <i><u>HEALTHIER</u></i>  PETS!!</strong></p>

</div></div>","160 MILLION PETS CANNOT  BE WRONG!!

My name is Dr. Salvatore DeRicco, and 160 million is how many – of the estimated 200 million dogs and cats – in the USA, alone, have PERIODONTAL (GUM) DISEASE.  And, according to the American Veterinary Dental College, “periodontal disease is the most commonly occurring clinical condition occurring in adult dogs and cats, and is entirely preventable”.  And clear evidence exists of links between periodontal disease and heart, liver, lung, kidney and pregnancy diseases; diabetes; and even  tumors! 
The History is that I am an orthodontist and invented a great  new toothbrush for braces – The SPOT LESS BRUSH (www.SpotLessBrush.com) - which many orthodontists and orthodontic patients have reported that they also like using for their pets, since it has such a small  head size and only one single row of shorter-than-average bristles.  So, I consulted with hundreds of Veterinarians and Veterinary Technicians - over the past year, and learned that many pet owners do not  brush their pets’ teeth, and the reasons why, so I’ve now invented The GUMLINERS (www.HealthierPetsNow.com) – for pets, to make oral care easier  for pet and owner alike, and more effective - in the effort to prevent periodontal disease and the associated bodily/organ diseases that it can lead to, which I refer to – collectively, as “PETiodontal Diseases”, (since they begin with periodontal  disease), by just “SWEEPING their GUMLINES”, regularly!  You see, unlike you and me, it's very  uncommon for dogs and cats to get cavities, so the existing pet toothbrushes are often considered LARGER than necessary, for pet oral care, and present difficulty in predictably  fitting all around the gumline, and, thereby targeting the primary  zone that counts.  And, unlike yours and mine, pets' teeth vary dramatically  in height - much like a city skyline, but the gumline is uniform and can provide a convenient ""track"" to guide your efforts - much like the street or sidewalk, at the base of that skyline.  Finally, unlike you and me, only the gumline on the outer  (lip and cheek) sides of the teeth needs to be brushed - the tongue's activity cleanses the tongue sides of the teeth, effectively.  That's what makes brushing easier  and quicker  for owners (i.e. before you both  get frustrated) and more effective  and tolerable  for your pet(s).  And to take it further, numerous Veterinarians complained about the fact that no toothbrush exists for dogs' upper molars, which curve inward - towards the palate, and despite that being among the areas where the highest  incidence of periodontal (gum) disease occurs!  That's why we built the compound bends into one end of our brush heads.
So, together, let’s get “SWEEP the GUMLINE” to start sweeping the NATION!!  And let's have a Nation of 160 million HEALTHIER  PETS!!
But please be aware that this doesn't  replace professional Veterinary dental cleanings, but rather, supports  and supplements  them, for a collaborative  effort between Veterinarian and owner - just like your own  daily toothbrushing is not a replacement for your dental cleanings and check-ups!
What We Need & What You Get
We have working single-ended prototypes that have been tested by numerous pet owners, and they LOVE them!!  And we also have a 3-D printed double-ended prototype, and are ready to begin having injection moulds fabricated!  Our moulding fees are $12,000.  Then, our manufacturing cost will be $6,000. 
Your rewards are discounted  pre-orders for The GUMLINERS.  Like human toothbrushes, pet toothbrushes should not  be shared between pets, (no matter what  they lick or eat, anyway!).  And, by ordering multiple GUMLINERS, you can save on shipping and handling!
If we do not reach our goal, we will continue our mission to get ""SWEEP the GUMLINE"" to Sweep the Nation - with further fundraising efforts, until all  backers' orders are fulfilled.
We have three separate crowdfunding campaigns going, for the three different sizes of GUMLINERS - Lil, Mid, and Large, since pets come in so many different breeds and sizes, so please make sure you select the right one.

<p>Moria Hilliard Rust is 32 years old and has left behind a 7 year old son, and a close, loving family. She passed away today, April 12th, 2013. She has been in the hospital for the past 6 months with numerous complications of liver and kidney failure. She was on the transplant waiting list but it was determined she was too ill to receive the organs. Unfortunatly Moria has no life insurance. Her ex-husband is in jail so he can be of no help. Neither can her father, who is also unemployed. This only leaves Moria's mother and step father to take care of her funeral/burial expenses.

<h3>Help Aimee Bouy Williams Finish the Fight Against Cancer!</h3>
<p>Aimee was diagnosed in July of 2012 with a sarcoma encased in neurofibroma on her hip. She underwent treatment at MD Anderson in Houston and Ochsner Health Center in Baton Rouge. After a long and brave fight, Aimee beat the cancer in her hip. On a routine check up in January, it was discovered that the cancer had spread to her lungs. Aimee has remained remarkably positive throughtout this ordeal. She is currently receiving treatment in Baton Rouge and is resting at home between treatments.</p>
<p>Aimee is a caring and compassionate person. She is a mother to Zoie, a wife to Lionel, a sister to Jason, and a daughter to Debbie and Danny. Over the last nine months, her family has had to endure some hardships over the course of her treatment, both emotional and financial. Her extended family held a fundraiser in October that raised close to $2500, but those funds were quickly spent. As she faces the next journey down her road to recovery, she and her family need your help.</p>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign will go directly to the Williams family. They will go to things like utilities, child care, travel expenses to and from treatment, and general cost of living. The money will go to the tangible things but the goodwill and fellowship behind your donation will go to Aimee and her family's piece of mind. Your donation will help Aimee concentrate on her recovery. Your donation will reinforce her positive attitude. Your donation will ensure that Aimee and her family have the tools at their disposal to help her finish the fight.</p>
<p>Over the next 45 days, we encourage you to donate to this campaign and we encourage you to ask the same from others. Let's come together as a community and show that we can support our own. Let's show Aimee, Lionel and Zoie that they are not alone in this fight and we intend to help them finish it.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1. Smart Diapers work with our app to keep track of your child's health</strong></p>
<p>Once a day, when changing your child or when you simply notice that the diaper is wet, scan the front of the Smart Diaper with our mobile app.  It takes less than ten seconds to take your phone out of your back pocket, scan, and put the phone back.  </p>
<p>There is no need to wait for results - you canput the phone back in your pocket and change your child.  Our algorithms will begin to analyze the data, looking for new trends.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Why should I be passionate about supporting Smart Diapers?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Diapers are not a replacement for a mother's intuition, nor for medically accepted diagnostic testing.  Instead, Smart Diapers are meant for alerting you of developing problems before visible symptoms appear, when you see symptoms and don't know what they mean, or when you see symptoms and are tempted to ignore them because you don't see their progress.    </p>
<p><strong>3.  How do Smart Diapers work?</strong></p>
<p>Kidneys filter specific solutes from blood into urine.  By taking useful data on these solutes, as well as by picking up on signs of bacterial activity from a wet Smart Diaper, we make use of something that would normally be thrown directly into the trash.  Smart Diapers alert you to certain conditions that require immediate attention and also track your child's health for months, automatically looking for emerging trends in multiple combinations of parameters.  Some of the parameters that Smart Diapers track have no absolute ""good range"", and it is the changes in those parameters that are meaningful.</p>
<p>Smart Diapers are not meant to report a daily number, but, rather, only speak up in those rare cases when you should contact your physician for follow-up testing.</p>
<p><strong>4. What can you tell me about my child</strong></p>
<p>The data we track in the first version of Smart Diapers can reveal signs of</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>urinary tract infection</strong></li>
<li><strong>prolonged dehydration</strong></li>
<li><strong>developing kidney problems. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is not to create another quantified self gadget, but to create a product that is unobtrusive in your daily life and only speaks up when there is reason to see a pediatrician or a specialist.</p>
<p><strong>Why monitor for urinary tract infections</strong></p>
<p>Any child can get a urinary tract infection, though girls get them more often than boys. 7-8% of girls have it by the age of 24 months. Most UTI's are not serious, but some can lead to chronic kidney infections which can cause permanent damage such as poor kidney function and high blood pressure later in life.</p>
<p>When symptoms are present, they can range from mild to severe, but, unfortunately, they are difficult to observe in children who wear diapers. UTI symptoms can include fever, pain or burning during urination with frequent discharge of a few drops of urine at a time, irritability, not eating and nausea. </p>
<p>Often, the symptoms may appear to pass, but because of structural deformities or simply because the body has found a temporary way to deal with the bacteria, the infection can recur - while the child will simply appear as having ""just another fever.""</p>
<p><strong>Why monitor for prolonged dehydration</strong></p>
<p>Every wonder if your child is drinking enough? Are you transitioning from breastfeeding to formula? Introducing a cup? Has your child had a sore throat for days?</p>
<p>We don't want to make you worry after a day, but if we see that your child's urine is overly concentrated for a prolonged period, we'll give you a heads up.</p>
<p><strong>Why monitor for chronic kidney conditions</strong></p>
<p>Kidney problems can develop for multiple reasons - due to premature birth, an infection, undiagnosed diabetes, etc. Typically, observable symptoms don't show up until several years later. Our goal is to look for early signs and to make sure that children who require diagnosis, monitoring, or care will receive it before the observable symptoms set in. </p>
<p>For children who have already been diagnosed with a chronic kidney condition, we hope Smart Diapers will obviate the need for parents to squeeze the diapers manually onto a urine analysis strip and keep track of results with a paper log sheet.</p>
<p>For researchers, we hope Smart Diapers and the data we collect become a useful tool. Are you a pediatric nephrologist? Interested in learning with us?  Please get in touch by emailing <a href=""mailto:contact@pixiescientific.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@pixiescientific.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Designed with safety in mind</strong></p>
<p>Smart Diapers were designed for both ergonomics and safety. Our dry reagent panel is separated from your child's skin by the diaper's absorbent core, and although we are sure the reagents do not produce even a rash when in direct contact, we've shown that no chemicals make it through the absorbent core to touch your child.</p>
<p>The reagents, diapers, and other components of Smart Diapers will be sourced from vendors in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the UK, with the panel to be manufactured in our own facility in Brooklyn, NY under tight quality control.</p>
<p><strong>5. Privacy - you can count on us</strong></p>
<p>We will never share information that can be traced to your child.  We do plan to collaborate with specific academic research partners to help us learn and improve Smart Diapers, but th eonly way we'll share any data with them is after anonymizing it. </p>
<p>All data is securely stored on Amazon's S3 and Amazon's databases. Communication between our phone app and Amazon and storage of data is secured by following the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.</p>
<p><strong>6. Why we need you to back us: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>to start up automated manufacturing:</strong>  with the help of two automation vendors, we've designed a manufacturing line for producing a reagent panel, and also  negotiated agreements with two raw materials vendors;  we estimate the time to our first production run at the end of November;</li>
<li>
<strong>to conduct our first study to monitor kids in a hospital: </strong> we have a signed agreement with University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital to study performance of Smart Diapers for monitoring children in pediatric intensive care;  we will commence limited production for this and other research collaborations;</li>
<li>
<strong>to complete the FDA registration process:</strong> we and our clinical research organization (CRO) partner met with the FDA Office of In-Vitro Diagnostics on May 2nd to get their feedback on the registration requirements and we are now designing a study to produce data for registration;  the CRO has taken multiple urine analysis products to marke and our safety testing partner is used by Colgate Palmolive and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>7. The perks - help us improve our algorithms and be the coolest parent on the playground: </strong></p>
<p>As our backer, you will receive Smart Diapers Pilot Edition and the Pilot Edition of the app prior to FDA approval.  The Pilot Edition will allow our algorithms to improve while you begin collecting data - in the simplest and most unobtrusive way to your new workflow as a parent.  You will also have first priority to order Smart Diapers upon FDA registration, while we are still ramping up production.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/914890/pictures/full/20130707103345-Indiegogo_pricing.png?1373218428"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Kidneys filter specific solutes from blood into urine.  By taking useful data on these solutes, as well as by picking up on signs of bacterial activity from a wet Smart Diaper, we make use of something that would normally be thrown directly into the trash.  Smart Diapers alert you to certain conditions that require immediate attention and also track your child's health for months, automatically looking for emerging trends in multiple combinations of parameters.  Some of the parameters that Smart Diapers track have no absolute ""good range"", and it is the changes in those parameters that are meaningful.
Smart Diapers are not meant to report a daily number, but, rather, only speak up in those rare cases when you should contact your physician for follow-up testing.
4. What can you tell me about my child
The data we track in the first version of Smart Diapers can reveal signs of

urinary tract infection
prolonged dehydration
developing kidney problems. 

Our goal is not to create another quantified self gadget, but to create a product that is unobtrusive in your daily life and only speaks up when there is reason to see a pediatrician or a specialist.
Why monitor for urinary tract infections
Any child can get a urinary tract infection, though girls get them more often than boys. 7-8% of girls have it by the age of 24 months. Most UTI's are not serious, but some can lead to chronic kidney infections which can cause permanent damage such as poor kidney function and high blood pressure later in life.
When symptoms are present, they can range from mild to severe, but, unfortunately, they are difficult to observe in children who wear diapers. UTI symptoms can include fever, pain or burning during urination with frequent discharge of a few drops of urine at a time, irritability, not eating and nausea. 
Often, the symptoms may appear to pass, but because of structural deformities or simply because the body has found a temporary way to deal with the bacteria, the infection can recur - while the child will simply appear as having ""just another fever.""
Why monitor for prolonged dehydration
Every wonder if your child is drinking enough? Are you transitioning from breastfeeding to formula? Introducing a cup? Has your child had a sore throat for days?
We don't want to make you worry after a day, but if we see that your child's urine is overly concentrated for a prolonged period, we'll give you a heads up.
Why monitor for chronic kidney conditions
Kidney problems can develop for multiple reasons - due to premature birth, an infection, undiagnosed diabetes, etc. Typically, observable symptoms don't show up until several years later. Our goal is to look for early signs and to make sure that children who require diagnosis, monitoring, or care will receive it before the observable symptoms set in. 
For children who have already been diagnosed with a chronic kidney condition, we hope Smart Diapers will obviate the need for parents to squeeze the diapers manually onto a urine analysis strip and keep track of results with a paper log sheet.
For researchers, we hope Smart Diapers and the data we collect become a useful tool. Are you a pediatric nephrologist? Interested in learning with us?  Please get in touch by emailing hello@pixiescientific.com.
5. Designed with safety in mind
Smart Diapers were designed for both ergonomics and safety. Our dry reagent panel is separated from your child's skin by the diaper's absorbent core, and although we are sure the reagents do not produce even a rash when in direct contact, we've shown that no chemicals make it through the absorbent core to touch your child.
The reagents, diapers, and other components of Smart Diapers will be sourced from vendors in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and the UK, with the panel to be manufactured in our own facility in Brooklyn, NY under tight quality control.
5. Privacy - you can count on us
We will never share information that can be traced to your child.  We do plan to collaborate with specific academic research partners to help us learn and improve Smart Diapers, but th eonly way we'll share any data with them is after anonymizing it. 
All data is securely stored on Amazon's S3 and Amazon's databases. Communication between our phone app and Amazon and storage of data is secured by following the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.
6. Why we need you to back us: 


to start up automated manufacturing:  with the help of two automation vendors, we've designed a manufacturing line for producing a reagent panel, and also  negotiated agreements with two raw materials vendors;  we estimate the time to our first production run at the end of November;

to conduct our first study to monitor kids in a hospital:  we have a signed agreement with University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital to study performance of Smart Diapers for monitoring children in pediatric intensive care;  we will commence limited production for this and other research collaborations;

to complete the FDA registration process: we and our clinical research organization (CRO) partner met with the FDA Office of In-Vitro Diagnostics on May 2nd to get their feedback on the registration requirements and we are now designing a study to produce data for registration;  the CRO has taken multiple urine analysis products to marke and our safety testing partner is used by Colgate Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson.



7. The perks - help us improve our algorithms and be the coolest parent on the playground: 
As our backer, you will receive Smart Diapers Pilot Edition and the Pilot Edition of the app prior to FDA approval.  The Pilot Edition will allow our algorithms to improve while you begin collecting data - in the simplest and most unobtrusive way to your new workflow as a parent.  You will also have first priority to order Smart Diapers upon FDA registration, while we are still ramping up production.

With your backing and help in improving our algorithms we will launch the best diapers you could possibly buy for your child!  Please join us on our journey.
Thank you kindly for your support,
The Smart Diapers team

<h3><strong>What is an artist without his sight?</strong></h3>
<p>I have been a working artist for the last 20+ years, about 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Keratoconus. A degenerative eye disease that has now rendered my left eye pretty much useless, my right eye is next. As my sight degrades my work has suffered, I cannot produce what I used too, and certainly not in the detail and numbers I want. The severe Keratoconus in my left eye cannot be corrected by any lens or non-surgical means.</p>
<p>Even though I live in a province with health coverage, eyes are not covered for anything really. The Corneal Cross-linking procedure to correct this is $4000 per eye, and $6000 for glasses and lens replacements during the healing process. None of this is covered by health care. I make enough to pay my bills and survive, for now, but not enough to save any extra for this procedure. I’ve been trying for the last few years, but this economy is brutal.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How can you help</strong></h3>
<p>You can help by spreading the word and/or going for one of my perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Perks</strong></h3>
<p>I don’t want something for nothing.</p>
<p>As an artist, when I sell a piece of my work the gallery takes 50% off the top which is the usual cut. Here I have chosen to create a few limited edition pieces that will never see a gallery but I will sell for the gallery price, keeping the gallery’s commission for my eyes. I have created 3 new sprig designs for this project;</p>
<p>-       “One-Eyed Demon”</p>
<p>-       “All-Seeing Steampunk Eye”</p>
<p>-       “Cthulhu”</p>
<p>I have also included my much sought after recipe for White Chocolate Caramel Corn. I hope I have included perks for every level. All amounts include shipping costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Outcome</strong></h3>
<p>Basically, I’ll be able to see. See without the constantly shifting blurry vision, without the staggering headaches that force me into a darkened room for sometimes days. I’ll be able to work at full capacity again, continue my creative life.</p>
<p>All money received will be going to the corneal cross-linking procedure for my left eye ($4000), new glasses/lenses during recuperation ($4-6000) and covering bills for the estimated 1-2 month period that I won't be able to work in my studio. If enough is raised I'll have my right eye done at the same time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>

<h3><strong>A little more about Keratoconus </strong></h3>

<p>Keratoconus can cause substantial distortion of vision, with multiple images, streaking and sensitivity to light all often reported by the patient. It is typically diagnosed in the patient's adolescent years and attains its most severe state between the ages of 20 and 40. If afflicting both eyes, the deterioration in vision can affect the patient's ability to drive a car or read normal print.</p>
<p>In most cases, corrective lenses fitted by a specialist are effective enough to allow the patient to continue to drive legally and likewise function normally.

   On May 4th, 2013, William was diagnosed with Wilms tumor. Wilms tumor is a type of cancer that usually starts in the kidneys.  It is the mostcommon type of kidney cancer in children. It typically occurs in children, rarely in adults. William has tumors on both kidneys, labeling it Stage 5. William is currently receiving chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer center in New York City. The tumor on one kidney has grown so large it is on 95 percent of his kidney. The doctors are hoping toshrink  both  tumors with the chemo, and then surgically remove one kidney. The doctors have told Pete and Suzanne that they have a long, hard road ahead. Although the Fameletti family has been dealt so many hardships these past few months, they still manage to stay strong and positive for both William and Cliff.  
 For anyone who is reading this any donation matters and is greatly appreciated. Please keep William and the famelettis in your prayers. Thank you",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">  In March, my grandpa fell ill. In a matter of days, He nearly died from double pneumonia. On release, he was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. Years of running dredges and dragline cranes have scarred his lungs beyond any hope of repair. As of March, he had 10% functionality in his lungs, and his condition is degenerative. He is on oxygen, 24/7. Prednisone is slowing the progression, but in a matter of months, he has maxed out what his oxygen machine is capable of delivering. As his body's ability to take in oxygen decreases, his cognitive functions are slipping away. My grandma and mom are doing all they can, but with each call home, I can hear the stress and strain in their voices. </span></p>
<p> I don't have a lot of saints in my family tree. Those close enough, know that I come from circumstances. However, there was always safety in my grandparents. From my father/stepfather, I learned fear, guilt, and how to stand right back up after a punch. From my grandparents, I learned to take care of horses, and how to quick-draw a pistol. My grandpa never raised his voice, except for when my horse got into some kind of mischief. ""Work"" consisted of chores to be done around the stables….not something the family had to do to survive. Saints indeed. </p>
<p>While I have been keeping busy, and good things are happening for my career, the monetary payoff is not yet in hand. Truth is, I've barely kept my nose above water, these past few months. Not that I'm complaining… after years of busting my ass, my career is finally starting to happen. Good things are on their way.  That said, when it comes to my grandpa, I do not have the luxury of time. With each passing week, he slips a little more. </p>
<p>Come mid-October, I plan to hit the road for Louisiana. It will be about 4 days there, and I'll camp along the way. I'd like to spend at least a week, if not more, with him. I know I'll need the ride back, to process what is most likely a goodbye trip. As we all know, life (and subsequent overhead) does not pause for such things. As it stands, I cannot afford to make this trip. As much as I tend to equate crowd funding with tarted up begging…. I'm not in much of a position to put on airs. So here is what I'm asking: </p>
<p>1-If we work in the same industry: Bookings and referrals. If I'm not already booked, I'll take it. I still assist, and I'm top tier at that. I still tech, and last but not least, I shoot. </p>
<p>2- I'm culling the herd. Want a dirt bike? I've got an '85 xt350… non-op'd, and needs work. Make any offer, and take it away. Want a track bike? I've got a '73 RD350 race bike. No papers. Not street legal.  It has been sitting for a while, so it would be wise to change all seals (these motors can be rebuilt in an afternoon). It has mikuni's from sudco, koni's on the rear, steal braided lines on the front, pipes and carbon fiber cans. It is already safety wired, as well. I'll also throw in a Chinoy ignition kit.. This bike is BAD ASS, and I don't want to get rid of it. $1,500  (what a bargain!) takes her away…</p>
<p>3-Short term sublet- Sublet my room while I'm gone. Let's make a deal. </p>
<p>4- Last of all… donations. This isn't going to be cheap. Overhead, gas, tires, and 3 weeks of not earning… Even with hustle and sales, I'm not sure I can cover the whole nut by then. Anything helps. I'll be in permanent debt of gratitude and favors. </p>
<p>Those are the cards on the table. I'll be documenting the whole trip. Thanks in advance. </p>

about an hour and a half outside Yerevan, Armenia's capital, 160 elementary
school children are poised for a nutrition and health revolution. Children of
Armenia Fund (COAF) wants to include Aragatsavan's school in its highly

Armenia's schools. Students either go hungry, eat a small pastry or simply
leave their campus to find food throughout the school day. In 2012, COAF
did a survey of 800 schoolchildren in rural Armenia and found that 785 of them
had signs of decay on their adult teeth. </span><br/><br/><span class=""apple-style-span"" style=""color: black; font-family: Helvetica;"">By building a kitchen, cafeteria and brushadrome

mirrors where children wash their hands before and brush their teeth after
their daily lunch. COAF's program will provide the children with toothbrushes,
toothpaste and training for the school nurse to learn how to teach and monitor
the kids as they experience the lifelong value of a healthy smile.
Additionally, COAF's dental health partners will treat the children's teeth with
fluoride once every 6 months to prevent tooth decay, and fund treatments for

forever. Aragatsavan's
elementary students want happy tummies and healthy teeth--who wouldn't? Build
them a cafeteria and brushadrome this summer!
In a little village called Aragatsavan located
about an hour and a half outside Yerevan, Armenia's capital, 160 elementary
school children are poised for a nutrition and health revolution. Children of
Armenia Fund (COAF) wants to include Aragatsavan's school in its highly
successful cafeteria and brushadrome program by building a space on the campus
where 1st-4th graders (ages 6-11) can have a healthy hot meal and brush their
teeth every day for a year.There is currently no system-wide lunch program in
Armenia's schools. Students either go hungry, eat a small pastry or simply
leave their campus to find food throughout the school day. In 2012, COAF
did a survey of 800 schoolchildren in rural Armenia and found that 785 of them
had signs of decay on their adult teeth. By building a kitchen, cafeteria and brushadrome
(tooth-brushing station), COAF is hacking away at these figures one school at a
time. Aragatsavan will be the 4th school to participate in the program. The brushadrome is a large room with sinks and
mirrors where children wash their hands before and brush their teeth after
their daily lunch. COAF's program will provide the children with toothbrushes,
toothpaste and training for the school nurse to learn how to teach and monitor
the kids as they experience the lifelong value of a healthy smile.
Additionally, COAF's dental health partners will treat the children's teeth with
fluoride once every 6 months to prevent tooth decay, and fund treatments for
children whose teeth are already damaged.  The cafeteria will include a kitchen and several
tables with chairs in a sunlit room. Children will not only eat healthy food here, but also participate in COAF's Healthy
Lifestyle Club after school program that celebrates and teaches good eating, proper hygiene and lifestyle habits.Job CreationShort-term work will be available to the
construction team, while 1 cook and 2 kitchen staff will be hired to run the facility
long-term.SustainabilityCOAF regards its program as an
""intervention""-- since their support becomes minimal after the first
year. At that point, the school will have received enough training to be able
to sustain the commitment to supporting healthy meals and proper oral hygiene  indefinitely. Aragatsavan's school principal,
Anahit Ter-Martirosyan, has already committed to this. Project TimelineConstruction will take place during the summer and the entire facility will be ready for the
children once school opens in September of 2014!Note: This campaign is a paid endeavor, created by ONEArmenia for COAF.--------------Այս քարոզարշավը միջոցներ է հավաքում Հայաստանի Մանուկների

<h2><strong>Marvin's Story<br/></strong></h2>
<strong><br/></strong>
</div>
<div><strong>My name is Marvin Haak Jr, In October 2010 I was diagonsed with a rare colon cancer, Melanoma of the colon. This is an aggressive fast moving cancer that does not respond to conventional treatment methods well. Primary treatments of Maligant Anoreltal Melanoma is surgery.<br/></strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>  There has been some reported responses to Radiation treatment but also a high failure rate. My doctors and I are giving the radiation a try as there is little known about this cancer.

<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong> My doctors are open minded about alternative cancer treatments. But insurance doesn't pay for alternative cancer treatments, they also only cover 70% of my conventional treatments and surgery. This is why I need your Help.<br/></strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<h2><strong>The Impact<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The goal of this campaign is to alleviate some of the financial burden off of Marvin. The stress of worrying about money for the costs that insurance does not cover and what they will not cover as far as treatments go is taking my focus away from what should be my main job, healing myself.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> Any money raised will go toward uncovered medical costs and alternative treatments that I have started but am now cutting back on due to my funds running out. I have more faith in the alternative treatments working and cutting back on them due to funds is scary. As I feel they are doing more good at fighting this cancer than anything.<br/></strong></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What We Need<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> My hope is to raise enought funds to get back on track with the alternative healing methods I have started. I know times are tough but I need your help to fight this. Even if you can only offer a dollar, ( I only need 19.000 of you, Hey you never know.) It will be a great help.<br/></strong></p>

<h1><b>Puck Concept</b></h1>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p>We set out to design a socket that would incorporate a microprocessor and a series of on-board sensors that can  communicate with amputees in REAL TIME and advise the user how to remedy adverse conditions. The system is able to provide socket diagnostics and relay written messages and warnings before tissue damage occurs.</p>

<p><i>""Imagine if you were an amputee and had limited sensation in your limb.  You are out with your family at a family reunion and your smartphone texts you  ""Please adjust your prosthesis because excess pressure has been detected on the end of your leg."" This dialogue between the user and the prosthesis could save countless surgeries and prevent serious injuries to prosthetic users.""</i></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1><b>How Does It Work?</b></h1>

<p>Real simple, the prosthetic socket (part the amputee's leg slides into) is manufactured with a void in the very end of the socket, which is typical in the industry.  The Puck is inserted into the void, the Puck now becomes the bottom of the socket and is open to the environment of the prosthesis so it is possible to access, analyze and control the internal socket!  The vacuum system creates a secure connection between the prosthesis and the amputee so that no movement can occur. This positive linkage allows for better control and more comfort.</p>

<h1><b>Simplicity In Design</b></h1>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>The SmartPuck is very unassuming...undetectable on a prosthesis.  Because the SmartPuck is inside the socket it sets the bar for simplicity in design and function.</div>

<p>The SmartPuck system supports the use of 3D printers, which produce no mold material waste.  We promote the use of recyclable socket materials.  The SmartPuck unit is a modular unit so no waste occurs from connection components that are permanently installed in traditional sockets.</p>

<h1>Where We Are Today</h1>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<p>After years of
development we have officially launched the SmartPuck.   We have reached the following milestones:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The first release
featured an internal vacuum unit that helps suspend the prosthesis to the
amputees limb</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Completed the APP that controls the vacuum
system which is currently available on the iTunes store</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Patent Pending
on three products</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Granted UL
(Class II Medical Device) Certification in June 2013</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have secured
an agreement with Apple to be part of their gifting program</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have added a
prosthetic fabrication facility to help aide prosthetic clinics around the
nation manufacture the sockets that are adapted to fit the SmartPuck (many
clinics out source their fabrication)</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of all we
are ready to bring the intelligence feature of the system to life!</p>

<div>It sure would be cool if your leg could talk to you...</div>
<div>
<br/><p>The SmartPuck was invented by two clinical prosthetists (the guys who make legs) in Colorado and inspired by amputees that were looking for something better. One of the most secure ways to hold a prosthesis onto a limb is elevated vacuum.  Our team had used existing products on the market and had the same complaint from all of our patients ""the vacuum feels good , but it leaks and is too much trouble to maintain the system.""  We set out with the goal of fixing the problems with existing elevated vacuum systems and developed the first vacuum system that is designed to go inside the prosthesis. By placing the vacuum pump within the socket chamber, we eliminated 99% of the problems that occur.  One day, as we were working on the Bluetooth configuration we booted up the office computers and there it was... the new iPhone from Apple was released (2007).  The light went off, ""why can't we use the phone to control and communicate with the prosthesis"".  We have been hard at it ever since!</p>

Our CauseImprove the lives of amputees across the world, through better technologyThe most courageous individuals we know are amputees.  In the face of one of the most devastating events that can happen to a person, these folks get up everyday and inspire others with their courage and determination.  We want to help our Veterans, Soldiers, Children and Grandparents who have had to face an amputation...What is most rewarding as a prosthetist is to see someone take steps for the first time after undergoing an amputation.  We want to provide a solution for amputees throughout the world and raise the standard of care in advanced prosthetic socket technology.  Our goal is to provide every amputee a prosthesis with artificial intelligence to reward their courage through increased comfort, control and prevention of injury to their limbs.Tyler...  Doing what Tyler does.  (Which is pretty much whatever he wants to do!)The Problem...
For many years advancements in prosthetics have been in knees and feet.  Very little has been done to advance the most important part of the prosthesis, the socket; the portion that the amputee slides their leg into.  The socket determines the comfort level, function and responsiveness of a prosthetic device.  For the last 20 years the most advanced feature about a prosthetic socket was the type of material it was made of…  plastic, fiberglass or carbon fiber.  Crazy... We know.

What is
the SMARTPUCK?
The SmartPuck
is the world's first and only socket based artificial intelligence system that
can actually communicate with the amputee via their smart device.  This
intelligent system is on the forefront of bionic prosthetic technology and can
improve the fit, function and control of the prosthesis. The integrated sensor
system helps protect the amputee from adverse conditions within the socket.

We have an unlimited capacity to expand the functionality and capability of the SmartPuck remotely through over the air updates.


This is the cool part...  We already have a ton of electronics and hardware packed into the SmartPuck.  Through push software packages we can add / change the functions of the SmartPuck.
With your help these APPs are on our hit list to launch early next year!





Puck Concept

We set out to design a socket that would incorporate a microprocessor and a series of on-board sensors that can  communicate with amputees in REAL TIME and advise the user how to remedy adverse conditions. The system is able to provide socket diagnostics and relay written messages and warnings before tissue damage occurs.

""Imagine if you were an amputee and had limited sensation in your limb.  You are out with your family at a family reunion and your smartphone texts you  ""Please adjust your prosthesis because excess pressure has been detected on the end of your leg."" This dialogue between the user and the prosthesis could save countless surgeries and prevent serious injuries to prosthetic users.""
Royce CPO- Adaptec Prosthetics LLC





How Does It Work?

Real simple, the prosthetic socket (part the amputee's leg slides into) is manufactured with a void in the very end of the socket, which is typical in the industry.  The Puck is inserted into the void, the Puck now becomes the bottom of the socket and is open to the environment of the prosthesis so it is possible to access, analyze and control the internal socket!  The vacuum system creates a secure connection between the prosthesis and the amputee so that no movement can occur. This positive linkage allows for better control and more comfort.
Royce and Mike customizing a new SmartPuck Socket back in the lab...




Simplicity In Design

The SmartPuck is very unassuming...undetectable on a prosthesis.  Because the SmartPuck is inside the socket it sets the bar for simplicity in design and function.
""Great engineering is not a device with 50 buttons and lots of cool widgets, Great engineering is a device with one button with 50 widgets working you can't see.”  
David Firth-  Provel Inc.



Green Prosthetic Technology

The SmartPuck system supports the use of 3D printers, which produce no mold material waste.  We promote the use of recyclable socket materials.  The SmartPuck unit is a modular unit so no waste occurs from connection components that are permanently installed in traditional sockets.



Features







Where We Are Today


After years of
development we have officially launched the SmartPuck.   We have reached the following milestones:



The first release
featured an internal vacuum unit that helps suspend the prosthesis to the
amputees limb


Completed the APP that controls the vacuum
system which is currently available on the iTunes store


Patent Pending
on three products


Granted UL
(Class II Medical Device) Certification in June 2013

We have secured
an agreement with Apple to be part of their gifting program

We have added a
prosthetic fabrication facility to help aide prosthetic clinics around the
nation manufacture the sockets that are adapted to fit the SmartPuck (many
clinics out source their fabrication)


Most of all we
are ready to bring the intelligence feature of the system to life!












What's The Money For?


App Development : To advance the smart socket functionality. We can develop and infinite number of Apps that will give amputees critical information about their prosthesis including :
Physical Pressure - To prevent wounds and skin breakdown so further amputation of the residual limb is not required.
Moisture and Temperature - Monitor conditions inside the socket.
Gait - To ensure appropriate body alignment, reducing stress to the sound limb. 
...and data to justify to insurance that you need and deserve a new prosthesis!
CE Mark Certification : Required in order to provide this technology to amputees in Europe. 
Early Stage Development : Advance SmartPuck technology for above knee amputees. 


Our Journey


It sure would be cool if your leg could talk to you...

The SmartPuck was invented by two clinical prosthetists (the guys who make legs) in Colorado and inspired by amputees that were looking for something better. One of the most secure ways to hold a prosthesis onto a limb is elevated vacuum.  Our team had used existing products on the market and had the same complaint from all of our patients ""the vacuum feels good , but it leaks and is too much trouble to maintain the system.""  We set out with the goal of fixing the problems with existing elevated vacuum systems and developed the first vacuum system that is designed to go inside the prosthesis. By placing the vacuum pump within the socket chamber, we eliminated 99% of the problems that occur.  One day, as we were working on the Bluetooth configuration we booted up the office computers and there it was... the new iPhone from Apple was released (2007).  The light went off, ""why can't we use the phone to control and communicate with the prosthesis"".  We have been hard at it ever since!




We Need Your Help!





We respectfully ask for your support in our endeavor to improve the lives of amputees throughout the world by helping us bring the first intelligent socket computer system to life.  We have taken the SmartPuck system a long way, but we need your help and support to realize the full potential of this artificial intelligence system for amputees.  
Today with your help, we can fundamentally change the most important part of prosthetic technology...  the socket.

Testimonials

Robert:  ""I have had my smart puck now for about 3 weeks.  I am so happy to have one.  No more loose sockets, no more friction sores, no more painful walking.  It has changed my walking completely.  I am 63 and live on a small horse farm with my wife.  I am very active (have to be) and this system has really, really, helped me to be able to do the work around the place.  It has also helped the chronic back pain.  Not totally eliminated it, but I have had a substantial drop in it.  I wish I could have had this smart puck back in 1987 when I lost my right leg bk.""
Mike: ""The SmartPuck has changed my life.  I have never had a prosthesis actually feel like it’s a part of me.""
Dee:  ""What a difference ...the vacuum is the most comfortable socket I have ever had!""

Dave:  ""I love the fact I can control my prosthetic with my iPhone,  it is awesome.  I can perform on a completely new level.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Judy is a vibrant 38 year old woman who was recently diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera. </p>
<p>Polycythemia vera is a disorder of the bone marrow. It causes  overproduction of red blood cells, although the numbers of white blood cells and platelets are also increased.</p>
<p>It is a rare disease that occurs more often in men than women, and is rare in patients under age 40. It is usually associated with a gene mutation called JAK2V617F. The cause of this mutation is unknown.</p>
<p>Symptoms include but not limited to Breathing difficulty, Dizziness, Excessive bleeding, Fullness in the left upper abdomen (due to enlarged spleen), Headaches, Fatigue, Itchiness, Shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Because this disorder is still a relative unknown in the medical world, medical insurance providers do not all recognize or align the necessary treatments and medications to this disorder.</p>
<p>Judy's treatment has been thus far harrowing.  She has been taking several prescription medications, has frequent and painful blood draws (phlebotomies), bone marrow biopsies, DNA biopsies, and more. She has been prone to dizzy spells, blackouts, dangerously high body temps, and more. The Hematologist has tried to get her stabilized with medications and phlebotomies. Each time her red count starts to drop, a monkey wrench is thrown into the mix.</p>
<p>The thick blood caused by Polycythemia Vera is more prone to clotting.  Judy realized this as she suffered several minor strokes early on in the process.  Since these TIA's cause some vein damage, she is also now being treated by a Neurologist for these issues.</p>
<p>Since she works in a medical office, she is susceptible to infections, and one of these infections entered her blood stream through an open cut in one of her fingers.  This again threw treatment off as the Hematologist and Neurologist had to react and rethink treatment options.</p>
<p>With all the bone marrow biopsies, CAT scans, MRI's, medications, and procedures she has needed, and in short order, her medical bills have piled up.  Her healthcare insurance provider does NOT cover most of the treatments and she is going several times per week for these.  She is on several different and expensive medications such as hydroxyurea and coumadin/warfarin which again medical insurance only partially covers.  She continues to work her job at the medical office, and care for others around her while herself being fatigued and trying to make ends meet. She needs help, from some kind hearted person/people in order to meet the demands of the disorder.</p>
<p>This campaign is set up to help Judy pay her mounting medical bills.  All of the donations, 100% will be channeled directly to her doctors/healthcare insurance provider. </p>
<p>Those unable to donate cash, any and all leads in tracking down a cure for Polycythemia vera would be appreciated.  The medical community does not have a cure for it, but people can and do live relatively normal lives if treated properly.</p>

<h3>Hi my name is Randy Oliver and I am doing this campaign for my mother. I have never done this before so please understand that.. The whole reason for this campaign is basically the fact that my families life was turned upside down two years ago. This  has affected my mom and dads life tremendously, And Im doing this for them.</h3>
<p>I grew up in a normal family and a normal life, kinda spoiled if you want to know the truth. Then My parents got a divorce when I was 18 and things changed for the worse. I stayed with my dad and took it out on my mom cause I really didnt know what to do. My dad was so depressed and lost his job then we lost the house cars and he bikes. So we basically lost everything that we ever had in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>I didnt talk to my mom for almost a year cause I blamed her, my dad made me make amends with my mother and we tried to have a relationship. What it all comes down to is me feeling like she is going to be taken way to soon.  My parents have know each other since the third grade, and are despite the things that happened they are together and happy.</p>
<p>Then two years ago my mom began to feel numbness in her leg and then completely lost feeling, so they rushed her to the hospital and next thing I knew they said her leg had a blood clot and they were going to amputate!? I didnt understand how fast this could happen, but it brought the family that I let get away from me back together. My mom went in to immediate surgery, they cut her left leg off under the knee and tried to leave as much as they could but it was infected in the blood and then made her delirious. She was basically dying from blood infection, so they took her back for another surgery. Had to take her left leg above the knee this time to get all the dead tissue. She was in the ICU for Two months and basically in a medical coma and doesnt remember anything from us coming by to visit. This was heartbreaking looking at your mother and her looking at you like she had no idea who you were and sometimes looking into a gaze. She got fluid on her lungs and almost died three different times. It was the craziest thing I ever could of imagined for a woman who was just fine a month ago and only in her early 50's....</p>
<p>So the doctors finally got her health under control and brought he back to life again. We eventually got to take her home and she has been home most of the time since. She is now in a wheel chair and needs assistant due to losing her leg. My dad has had to quit his career to stay home with her, and take a job that pays him just enough money to pay bills. All cause its close to home now and he can take care of her more. They have known each other over thirty years and he still calls her his sweetheart after everything they have been through. My dad wants to do everything he can for her but he financially cannot. I cannot afford the things for them either that is why im here asking for any help I can. All I want to do for them is help them pay those medical bills that medicaid doesnt cover, there are a few prescriptions that they cant afford. And I would also like to get my mom dentures, she has teeth falling out and she is ashamed to smile and even leave the house cause of her teeth. Then if I can get enough money raised for her to get her dentures. I would like to help them with these extra bills and even try to give her some sort of self indulging to make her smile again..Maybe that is just a mancure or something of that nature or even a two day getaway to a lake house or something exciting..  Please if anyone can help this is definitely a good cause. I dont know how to repay everyone for helping but prayers will be sent your way!</p>

</div></div>","Project Description


VedaBars are based on the
ancient science of Ayurveda, the sister philosophy to yoga, which emphasizes
health through a properly balanced and nutritious diet.
The
idea for the first VedaBar came to me as I was shopping at a local health food
store in New York City. I came across the energy bar section, which is a place
I never usually go to, only because I’m NOT a ‘bar person’ - I don’t believe
that most energy bars are made consciously and are generally over-processed.
I
started reading the backs of each of the labels and couldn’t believe what I was
reading. So many preservatives, excessive and complex sugars and when I tasted
some of them, they ranged from dry and bland to sticky and sweet.    I couldn’t understand why anybody would over-engineer
something so simple you can still have great taste with 1/3 the ingredients
being used and it can still be nutritious. That was it. The light bulb went on.


VedaBars are made from whole and
organic ingredients that you can identify when you open the package. By using
whole food whose flavors already play very well with each other, there is no
need to add artificial anything.
We’re asking for you help to
fund VedaBars because we’ve been getting incredible interest in the bars so we
are hoping to upgrade our packaging, increase our production to meet
the current demand and broaden our reach new customers in the marketplace

<p>Cataracts
are the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. In Honduras alone,
there are more than 50,000 people who suffer from cataract blindness. For
almost all of these patients, vision can be fully restored with minimal
resources and a 20-minute surgery. For 20 years, ECHO Foundation (Eradicate
Cataracts Honduras Outreach) has supported Honduran ophthalmology with a
three-fold mission: support sustainable practices that increase surgical
volumes, contribute to educational and infrastructure improvements, and help
grow the ophthalmology sector in Honduras.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/868872/files/20140919113811-before_and_after_cataract_surgery.jpg?1411151891"" src="""" style=""width: 253px; height: 165px;""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Before and After Cataract Surgery.</i></p>
<p>In
2013, ECHO Foundation began a partnership with the San Pedro Sula Lions Eye
Hospital Fraternidad to increase the number of cataract surgeries performed at
their facility as part of ECHO’s Unidos Visión Sustainability Initiative. For
the past 10 years, Hospital Fraternidad has performed hundreds of cataract
surgeries per year, but has yet to break 1,000. Similarly sized facilities in
the developed world routinely perform several thousand surgeries per year.
Along the way, we have learned that a major obstacle to increasing the number
of sight-saving surgeries at Hospital Fraternidad is outdated, broken, or
missing equipment. </p>
<p>To
overcome this problem and increase the number of cataract surgeries in
Honduras, we are launching a three-year fundraising campaign to bring modern
equipment to this non-profit eye hospital. Over the next three years, we
will launch twelve fundraising campaigns, each focused on vital piece of
equipment. <i>With this new equipment, we
expect to increase surgical volumes to 1,500 per year!</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/868803/files/20140919105949-campaign_photo.jpg?1411149589"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b><i>The

<p>The current

and a clearer picture of the eye, making the surgeon’s job easier. The
microscope purchased for this campaign will have a teaching head, an invaluable
training tool that allows a second doctor or technician to view the same
picture that the operating surgeon has during surgery. Donations that exceed
the $15,000 goal will be used for additional cataract surgery supplies.</p>
<p>With the successful close of each quarterly

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Reaching 1,500 cataract surgeries per year is a
realistic goal for Hospital Fraternidad with modern equipment because of the
following reasons:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>There is a clear demand for these surgeries.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>ECHO and the San Pedro Sula Lions are organizations with a long-term
commitment to addressing cataract blindness in Honduras.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>There is a growing team of committed doctors, technicians, nurses
and administrators (both in the US and Honduras) working to eradicate cataract
blindness.</p>
<p>These factors have produced a growth in the number
of surgeries performed at Hospital Fraternidad from 453 in 2012 to an expected
1,000 in 2014. However, the hospital’s main bottleneck relates to the
antiquated equipment that its medical staff must rely on or the missing
equipment they lack. </p>
<p>ECHO Foundation has a 20 year track record as a
protagonist for Honduran ophthalmology. The San Pedro Sula Lions have been
working on issues related to Honduran ophthalmology for more than 20 years.
There is every reason to expect that the hospital will one day perform 2,500
cataract surgeries per year.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/875550/files/20140922202553-SPSLions2_12.12.13.jpg?1411442753"" src="""" style=""width: 420px; height: 315px;""/> </p><p><i>Our team of dedicated ECHO and San Pedro Sula Lions members.</i></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Ordinarily, it would be difficult to quantify
the impacts placing surgical equipment at a facility in a developing country
has on surgical volumes and facility sustainability. This is why we will be
working with the San Pedro Sula Lions to closely monitor our surgical impacts,
as well as the impact of our expansion program on the hospital’s financial
status. We will be updating future campaigns with changes in surgical volume as
we introduce new equipment to the hospital.</p>
<p>Keeping functional equipment working and in
good condition has historically been difficult at facilities in developing
countries. Some of the revenues from increased surgical volumes will be set
aside in a maintenance reserve to be used when needed to ensure that the equipment
will remain in top working condition.</p>
<p>This campaign is just the first step in turning
the Lion’s Hospital into a modern facility that can effectively eliminate
cataract blindness in Honduras. Building upon existing in-country resources and
working with an established local network will maximize the effect of each
capital equipment impact. Even with limited resources, the Lions Hospital has
performed hundreds of surgeries per year in the past. Your support in this
campaign will allow us to grow the hospital to full operating capacity and
positively impact the more than 50,000 poor cataract blind people in Honduras. </p>

select group who have supported ECHO at the Buena Vista level ($1,000 and
above). You will be publicly recognized on ECHO’s website and receive a
commemorative plaque thanking you for your support (plus all of the above).
$5000 –
See the impact first hand in Honduras! You will receive an invitation to join
one of the quarterly surgical brigades that ECHO runs and see first-hand the
great work that local and volunteer doctors can do with the right equipment
(plus all of the perks above).
The Impact
Reaching 1,500 cataract surgeries per year is a
realistic goal for Hospital Fraternidad with modern equipment because of the
following reasons:
1.  There is a clear demand for these surgeries.
2.  ECHO and the San Pedro Sula Lions are organizations with a long-term
commitment to addressing cataract blindness in Honduras.
3.  There is a growing team of committed doctors, technicians, nurses
and administrators (both in the US and Honduras) working to eradicate cataract
blindness.
These factors have produced a growth in the number
of surgeries performed at Hospital Fraternidad from 453 in 2012 to an expected
1,000 in 2014. However, the hospital’s main bottleneck relates to the
antiquated equipment that its medical staff must rely on or the missing
equipment they lack. 
ECHO Foundation has a 20 year track record as a
protagonist for Honduran ophthalmology. The San Pedro Sula Lions have been
working on issues related to Honduran ophthalmology for more than 20 years.
There is every reason to expect that the hospital will one day perform 2,500
cataract surgeries per year. Our team of dedicated ECHO and San Pedro Sula Lions members.
Risks & Challenges
Ordinarily, it would be difficult to quantify
the impacts placing surgical equipment at a facility in a developing country
has on surgical volumes and facility sustainability. This is why we will be
working with the San Pedro Sula Lions to closely monitor our surgical impacts,
as well as the impact of our expansion program on the hospital’s financial
status. We will be updating future campaigns with changes in surgical volume as
we introduce new equipment to the hospital.
Keeping functional equipment working and in
good condition has historically been difficult at facilities in developing
countries. Some of the revenues from increased surgical volumes will be set
aside in a maintenance reserve to be used when needed to ensure that the equipment
will remain in top working condition.
This campaign is just the first step in turning
the Lion’s Hospital into a modern facility that can effectively eliminate
cataract blindness in Honduras. Building upon existing in-country resources and
working with an established local network will maximize the effect of each
capital equipment impact. Even with limited resources, the Lions Hospital has
performed hundreds of surgeries per year in the past. Your support in this
campaign will allow us to grow the hospital to full operating capacity and
positively impact the more than 50,000 poor cataract blind people in Honduras.

<p>Hi I am Shanina
Knighton, a registered nurse with clinical experience in surgical care and
research and a PhD student at Case Western Reserve University Frances Payne
Bolton School of Nursing. My husband Robert Knighton is a great support to my endeavors so I felt inclined to share with you that he is a civil engineer and
has a background in project management, business development, sales, marketing,
and education.This is important because I refer to us in everything that I may do. <br/></p>
<p>This
campaign is very important to us for numerous reasons. Watching two very
important women in our lives struggle in their last days of life was daunting
for us. It was not because of the care they received, but because they just
wanted clean hands. For example, Robert’s grandmother had a stroke and with the
left side of her body not working, she would use her right hand to pick the dirt
from under her fingernails in effort to keep them clean. I have watched
hundreds and hundreds of patients in my presence not readily have the luxury of
convenient ways to clean their hands. In 2011 very few people thought patient’s
hands were an important issue, including large companies in this space! Since
then there has been an amplification of patient hand hygiene research, resource
support, and awareness from infection control leaders and hand sanitizer
producers. </p>
<p>Contributions
made by you to support our campaign is more important than you know. It will
help put your mind at ease the next time your mother, sister, uncle, brother,
or child go to the hospital and can’t get out of bed to clean their hands at
important times such as after the doctor shook their hand, after using the
urinal, or before eating a meal. Our product will serve as a voice for patients
scared to ask healthcare workers to clean their hands when they come near you
or your loved ones…35 million admissions per year to hospitals alone, excluding
our 1.7 million aging adults…Wow! Look at the magnitude of what your
contribution can mean in decreasing infections and illness. Remember at some
point in our lives we will all be a patient. </p>
<p>The $15,000 that we are asking you
to contribute will go towards product development. We have been working on a
prototype through Think Box an entrepreneurial resource center at my school and
will use the funding to purchase more materials. We have been working with
different arduino technology in creation of our first preliminary model to go
for larger funding. So you may be asking yourself “They started in 2011, why
now?” Our answer is “Mistakes and we spent our money securing our patents.” The
labor work done has been paid for out of pocket as well as with some small grant
support and competition winnings!</p>
<p>What’s in it for you? The top
contributor will have the luxury of helping us to name the dispenser! If you’re
not the top contributor don’t worry. We will make sure that your generous
contribution is recognized by giving you exclusive rights to see the first
finished product right before the launch! </p>
<p>Why will this work? It will work
because as we speak I am doing research in this area and I foresaw the
challenges of current products on the market. A well respected Infection
Preventionist told me I was ahead of my time. My husband and I are resilient
people and continue to work diligently and have learned from the word “No.”</p>
<p>What are the risks? We have spoken
with other companies in this space in hopes of partnerships and they might try
to beat us to market. How do we plan on overcoming this? With your support.
Even if you can’t support us financially please spread the word for our Patient
Hand Hygiene Smart Dispenser. Be sure to practice when you go to the hospital
it can save your life!</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>

We wash our body, face and hair daily, along with our clothes regularly, however most women only occasionally or never wash their makeup brushes. Ironic that one of the things we rely on to keep us looking our best, our makeup brushes, can actually be our worst enemy against breakouts and skin health.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Your brushes need to be properly cleaned </h3>
<h3><strong>to remove bacteria and buildup</strong></h3>
<div></div>
<p>Alcohol based quick dry cleaners only clean the bristle tips, plus they can damage both synthetic and natural hair bristles and loosen glue quickly. Experts highly suggest, the average woman should sterilize their brushes daily and deep clean with a water-based cleaner, at least once a week. Cosmetic stores, spas and makeup artists should sterilizer after each client and then properly deep clean brushes with a water-based cleaner once a day.</p>
<p>The reason this deep cleaning is very rarely done is due to the time it takes for brushes to dry and be able to use again. Some thick natural hair brushes can take 24 hours to air dry, leading to the possibility of mold growth. Improper drying position can cause moisture seepage and loosen bristles. </p>

<p>We have several fully functional prototypes of both Brush Medic Pro and Mini models in use by professional makeup artists locally and traveling nationally. We have aligned ourselves with a manufacturing company to produce units and will soon be ready for production as soon as CE, RoHS and UL listing certifications are complete.</p>
<p>We were able to speed up our production process time and keep pricing down by working with a manufacture with existing injection molds of products in other markets and innovatively modifying them to add our hardware and proprietary technology, ultimately producing our exclusive patent pending BRUSH MEDIC Makeup Brush Drying and UV Sterilizing Machines. <span style="""">This is also allowing us to start a low production run before this campaign ends for a quicker delivery of our first Brush Medic machines. 200 of each of our Brush Medic Pro and Mini models will be run with an expected April 2015 delivery. These are divided between our 6 options of ""EARLY BIRD"" perks, so act quickly or they will be gone! Our 2nd run of production will be ordered according to pre-orders here on Indiegogo with delivery estimated for June 2015. (see all perks for expected delivery dates of products)</span></p>
<p>Though we have big ambitions, we are a small start-up company and only have the capacity to finance this modest first production run. This is where you come in.  You can help us to increase the amount of product we can order from the factory as well as accelerate the speed with which we can get it into the hands of our customers. Your support will make this possible and will be a vital spark in growing a company obsessed with fixing this dirty secret of bacteria within the cosmetic industry.</p>
<p>This campaign's goal is set at raising a modest $25,000, this is due to being pretty far ahead in the production process. However, we fully expect to exceed that easily but if we do not reach our goal, rest assured we are still moving forward with production of all products and will deliver to the best of our ability as described.</p>
<p>As for our other available perks, we are already producing our wall racks and cleaning kits and will ship immediately at campaigns end, unless you selected a perk that is a ""package"", then it will ship along with your dryer/sterilizer.</p>

We have aligned ourselves with a manufacturing company to produce units and will soon be ready for production as soon as CE, RoHS and UL listing certifications are complete.
We were able to speed up our production process time and keep pricing down by working with a manufacture with existing injection molds of products in other markets and innovatively modifying them to add our hardware and proprietary technology, ultimately producing our exclusive patent pending BRUSH MEDIC Makeup Brush Drying and UV Sterilizing Machines. This is also allowing us to start a low production run before this campaign ends for a quicker delivery of our first Brush Medic machines. 200 of each of our Brush Medic Pro and Mini models will be run with an expected April 2015 delivery. These are divided between our 6 options of ""EARLY BIRD"" perks, so act quickly or they will be gone! Our 2nd run of production will be ordered according to pre-orders here on Indiegogo with delivery estimated for June 2015. (see all perks for expected delivery dates of products)
Though we have big ambitions, we are a small start-up company and only have the capacity to finance this modest first production run. This is where you come in.  You can help us to increase the amount of product we can order from the factory as well as accelerate the speed with which we can get it into the hands of our customers. Your support will make this possible and will be a vital spark in growing a company obsessed with fixing this dirty secret of bacteria within the cosmetic industry.
This campaign's goal is set at raising a modest $25,000, this is due to being pretty far ahead in the production process. However, we fully expect to exceed that easily but if we do not reach our goal, rest assured we are still moving forward with production of all products and will deliver to the best of our ability as described.
As for our other available perks, we are already producing our wall racks and cleaning kits and will ship immediately at campaigns end, unless you selected a perk that is a ""package"", then it will ship along with your dryer/sterilizer.

  Risks & Challenges  
Brush Medic LLC has developed and built all the products shown on this campaign and are not computer generated images (unlike many other companies using crowdfunding), of a product that is just an idea. Our prototypes have been fully tested for performance and safety, we have several that are currently being used daily by individuals and professionals with nothing but great praise and feedback. Our end product may differ only slightly than what is shown but only has an improvement. For example, our end product Brush Medic Pro, will have a digital timer that is not on our prototypes. Again, we are aligned with a manufacturing company and ready to go into production and believe we can deliver products within our estimated delivery dates shown on each perk.
Risks to you minimized
We are using Paypal and Apple Pay for credit card processing, so if anything happens and we do not deliver, they will always protect you!

Drew Cumpson and I'm a C-4 quadriplegic and ventilator dependent. In May 2011
The University of Guelph sent a small group of students to Peru. The purpose of
this international excursion was to enrich the learning experiences of each
student while providing aid to local communities in need. My heart,
determination and loving nature made me the ideal candidate for this excursion.
The 12-day journey was centered in the city of Lima, Peru. Our humanitarian
efforts began in a small shanty village located in the mountains of Lima. We designed,
commissioned and constructed a staircase to assist in the mobility of the
people who lived in this community. From a health and wellness standpoint we initiated
dental hygiene, immunization and lice programs centered on assisting the
children specifically. Along with the planned humanitarian efforts I made an
external connection with the children, the community, and the culture. </p><p>On May 10,
2011 the waves were big, the tide was high and the undertow was strong. Being a
lifeguard for the better part of 4 years I was fully certified and trained in
NLS, CPR and First Aid. I understood well the dangers of the ocean, but I could
not have foreseen what would have happened next. A massive wave came crashing
down on my head when I was least expecting it, taking me under with extreme
force. The sheer power of the wave pushed me down at a crushing speed where my head
made direct contact with the ocean floor. It was at this very moment I understood
something was wrong with my neck. Barely conscious I could not act on any of my
lifeguarding knowledge. As my friends worryingly approached my limp body to
perform a spinal roll over I mouthed “support my neck.” These were my last
words before falling unconscious.</p><p>I have spent
the last three years in the hospital due to the fact that I need 24 seven
nursing care and the government will only provide me with roughly 21 hours a
week in care. I have a fully accessible house to move home to that was built in
move-in ready for May of 2013. I am ready to move out of the hospital and into
the house but unfortunately do not have enough care needs to support that. That
is why I am reaching out to you.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I do not want to live in the hospital anymore! </span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p><p></p> <p></p><p>There

procedure, a surgeon creates small holes in the abdomen and inserts a
laparoscope so the diaphragm muscle can be seen. The surgeon then places small
electrodes in the diaphragm. ""Although results may vary, some patients are
provided the greatest freedom and are ventilator free for up to 24 hours a
day."" Electrodes are then attached to a small external battery powered
pulse generator, which stimulates the diaphragm, causing a contraction of
muscle. This allows air to fill the upper and lower parts of the lungs rather
than forcing air in with a mechanical ventilator. The stimulation is then used
to condition the diaphragm, enabling the patient to breathe longer without the
need of ventilator. The device is controlled through a four-channel,
battery-powered external pulse generator and eliminates the need for a source
of electricity and concern for power outages. Diaphragm dysfunction can result
in abnormal or absent respiration in patient populations of high-level SCI and
other injuries or diseases affecting the neuromuscular respiratory pathways. In
the US clinical trial, more than 50% of the eligible participants were able to
completely eliminate their need for mechanical ventilation. This new approval
enables SCI patients throughout Canada to access this technology that was only
previously available to clinical trial participants or through the Medical
Devices Special Access Program.</p><br/><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Benefits</span></h3><h3><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">The

<li>If you scroll through the links you will find may contradictory statement about the potential risks of smoking marijuana without some filter system. One New Zealand report suggested that smoking one unfiltered joint was the equivalent of smoking 20 filtered cigarettes.<br/>
</li>
<li>Another scientific report states that smoking a water bong actually is counter-productive in removing particulate matter.  THC is water soluble and some is lost with each puff. Tar is not water soluble so it is not extracted. This means that you have to make many more puffs to get a result from the THC, but you have had to take more inhalations of tar to get the desired result.<br/>

If you scroll through the links you will find may contradictory statement about the potential risks of smoking marijuana without some filter system. One New Zealand report suggested that smoking one unfiltered joint was the equivalent of smoking 20 filtered cigarettes.

Another scientific report states that smoking a water bong actually is counter-productive in removing particulate matter.  THC is water soluble and some is lost with each puff. Tar is not water soluble so it is not extracted. This means that you have to make many more puffs to get a result from the THC, but you have had to take more inhalations of tar to get the desired result.

Regardless of what people smoke, tobacco, cannabis or lettuce leaves, particulate matter being ingested into vital organs should ring health alarm bells. We might not like wearing seat belts, but we are fully aware of the benefits. 

Other Ways You Can HelpYou may be unable to contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
You, like me, might not smoke. Like me you may be concerned about friends and family who do. Like me, you may not like to see the harm that can befall these people and you feel that you NEED to do something to help.  Direct them to our pipes .
Like me, you may be worried about the harm caused by discarded butts to birds, fish and other wildlife - direct your smoking friends to Savorette

You may also dislike the thought of yourself, or others inhaling side stream smoke (Second hand smoke) - encourage your associates to visit Savorette

Spread the word that there is a better way to smoke, a safer way to smoke and environmentally more aware way to smoke. 
STOP PRESS: We have some pipes that we have decided not to sell.  They are exactly the same as our current models, but were a lightweight model we felt were not quite good enough for general release. We will give these free to persons who are seriously disadvantaged.  A letter to tell us why you need one and what you can do to help us get our product into the market and we will seriously consider your request. And please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Chlorella aids in reversing these symptoms by restoring the alkalinity in the body and assisting in the growth of gut flora.</li></ul><p> <strong>Chocolate</strong> not only connotes sweet reward but also contains anandamide, a molecule which locks into receptor sites in the brain known to increase feelings of bliss and relaxation.</p><ul><li>Why this helps: Anandamide stimulates the same receptor sites as opiates do.

Examples of what you might find in a box* and HOW they helpChlorella aids in detoxing the body of heavy metals. It is also alkalizing, hydrating and assists in the growth of healthy gut flora.Why this helps:  Alcohol and poor diet depletes the body of healthy gut flora which can cause symptoms of indigestion, constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating and discomfort. Chlorella aids in reversing these symptoms by restoring the alkalinity in the body and assisting in the growth of gut flora. Chocolate not only connotes sweet reward but also contains anandamide, a molecule which locks into receptor sites in the brain known to increase feelings of bliss and relaxation.Why this helps: Anandamide stimulates the same receptor sites as opiates do. By replacing an addiction with a healthy new food ritual, individuals in recovery can reward themselves with something sweet and experience feelings of bliss.   Reishi has been used for centuries in Chinese medicine to calm the nervous system and reduce anxiety and stress.  Why this helps: Part of recovery is restoring balance to the nervous system. Neurological imbalances can be responsible for erratic behavior, emotional instability and anxiety. Reishi not only has potent immunological properties but works to tone and stabilize the nervous system.*We work closely with our wholesale partners and team to ensure only the highest quality products make their way into our boxes.                           What people are saying                                                ""Recovery, for me, has to be holistic. I want it to enhance my life. My sobriety is more than living without alcohol and drugs; it is about living a life of balance and ultimately a sense of alchemy. It is about striving to achieve health and wellness in my whole self.  I want to feel energised and to enjoy life with a spring in my step. I believe that the supportive tools that Ekka have come up with could help those in recovery do just that. It can help educate people on the power that healthy and nutritious foods can harness and highlight how that might bring gifts to those in recovery. It will educate on the power of exercise and healthy choice. It will bring about a movement that I believe the recovery community needs: one of health and wellness and a holistic approach to recovery. And that would be truly magical."" - Olivia Pennelle w/ Liv's Recovery Kitchen                                                       ""I feel that big part of my recovery was getting my body back into shape, not just physically, but taking care of the whole internal system. Eating healthy and exercising was crucial to my recovery, during treatment I took supplements that the center advised and they made me feel great, once I got out I was lost and didn't know which supplements to buy nor did I have the time to buy them. I believe that Ekka's monthly subscription box will help guide individuals like myself in recovery to help them in the right direction, without worrying about where and what we should take or whether we need to order more, it is the convenience that made me became a member!  I think Ekka can help people in recovery to be happier and healthier individuals!"" -Damien Ross founder of Pocket Rehab (Recovery assistance app, ""Connect with peers anonymously 24/7"")                                                    ""Superfoods have been a huge part of my recovery. I did a lot of damage to my body over my years in my eating disorder and addiction and superfoods have helped heal my body. I also think that creating my food with intentionality about the nutrition if offers me is a wonderful form of self-care."" Nicky England founder of Lotus Recovery  Ekka Mission

</p><p></p>
<p>My name is Ian Rubijono-Bond.
 I’m building a martial arts school and I need your help.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2015 many of you
helped fund my campaign to participate in an advanced training seminar run by
the School of Oom Yung Doe. At that time, I was a teaching intern in the
school and committed to a rigorous personal practice. I was also studying full
time at Lesley University with a major in counseling and a minor in
holistic psychology. Now in 2016, I’ve completed my undergraduate degree, I’ve
earned my first-degree black belt, and have been granted the position of
Assistant Instructor. Yay! I have exceeded my goals with the love and
support of those in my life. Without it, I would not have been exposed to
such amazing training and would likely not be where I am today. Now it is
time reach further so I can give back.</p>
<p>This summer, I have the opportunity
to open my own Oom Yung Doe school. It is such
a great honor; I am so grateful to have this opportunity and for the support
from my teachers, but I also need your support.</p>
<p>With seed funding from you and the
Oom Yung Doe Regional Team, I will be overseeing daily operations at the new
Lexington location. This includes daily classes, satellite programs in the
area, as well as private lessons. Once funded, I will be able to share what I
love with my community. </p>
<p>Oom Yung Doe teaches eight martial
arts as one: Bagwa, Tai chi, Kung Fu, Aikido, Judo, Samurai, Kong Su (Tai Kwon
Do), and 18 weapons. While I was in school, and now as a postgraduate with a
degree in holistic and mental health, I have found nothing better to fully
address and develop the human condition. This is a 1500-year-old system of
martial arts, taught by patient and compassionate teachers, which has proven to
be the best way to build strength, peace, confidence, and greatly improve
mental and physical health. My teachers have done all of this for me and I will
help you achieve your goals of health and happiness as well.</p>
<p>The great thing about opening a
martial arts school: all you need is a roof and open space! My goal of $10,000
USD will cover build out, supplies, and operating expenses for the first few
months! But this campaign isn't only about my needs; I really feel it is about
you and helping each other create a supportive community. </p>
<p>To see some of the perks of
donating, see the list below!</p>
<p>· If you are drawn to
self-improvement both mentally and physically, as I was, a contribution of $245
will serve as your first month’s membership fee. Selecting this perk means
that until the physical location is open, you will be eligible for a private
lesson and follow up session. Once the physical location is open, you will be a
registered student for that first month and will have the opportunity to really
learn what Oom Yung Doe is and have the joy of experiencing it for yourself.
You will receive your uniform, and a specially formulated herbal spray that
greatly improves muscle and joint warm up and recovery times. As the
first month comes to a close, you decide if you want to continue your
membership.</p>
<p>· A contribution of $130
makes you eligible for a private lesson with me. In this session, we will
discuss your fitness and mental health goals, and then work on them one-on-one
for an hour. Whatever you may be interested in: Breathing techniques, meditation,
self-defense, core strength, you will be given a regiment to practice on your
own. We will also have a follow up session to check on your progress.</p>
<p>In the 2015 campaign, I was able to
raise $1000 over my goal! The success of that campaign helped me afford
advanced training to better my understanding of the art. My goal with this
2016 campaign is to give back to my community by creating a safe space for
those who want to better themselves and by sharing what I’ve learned. By helping
you and your loved ones better your health, increase your sense of peace,
confidence and build a strong sense of community – I aim to make a healthier,
more peaceful, more inclusive world; one person at a time.</p>
<p>Of course there are risks involved
in opening any business. There is the possibility of low student sign up rates.
The main source of revenue is student membership. But the best part of being a
teacher in this community is having the support from the regional and master
level teaching teams. The members of these teams have a combined 100+ years of
experience in teaching and daily school operations. If there is a time where I
need assistance with teaching, or have a question about students or anything
regarding the operation of a school, I am only a phone call away from my
teachers and fellow instructors. The master level instructors regularly visit
the schools throughout the year. </p>
<p>Because it is a martial arts
school, there is always some chance of injury. However, through the system
taught at Oom Yung Doe schools, injuries are almost nonexistent. Other than the
occasional strain or pulled muscle from students pushing themselves too hard,
our self defense is practiced and monitored for safety, but is highly effective
when applied fully. </p>
<p>Even if signing up does not
interest you or you are unable to contribute, spread the word! Helping you and
anyone else to improve their quality of life is what I want to do with my time
on earth, and I thank you so much for your help. Be well. </p>

With the Sunrise Pillow's Deep Sleep technology for nights & Sunrise Alarm to start your day, you can effortlessly improve your body's sleep & wake hormones thanks to the power of science & technology. Say goodbye to restless nights and groggy mornings. 
Your own personal sunrise is adjustable and can gradually rise for 5-minutes up to 30 minutes, it’s your choice.How you sleep is only half of the equation. Nature's sunrise isn't just to light the way to the work in the morning. The gently rising light starts an invigorating chain reaction that's natural and is key to being your best and feeling vibrant, every day.         
Our bodies are designed to wake up to light SunriseIn the morning your pillow will simulate a full sunrise. The gradually increasing light falls on your sleeping eyelids telling your body to stop producing Melatonin (the sleep hormone) and begin producing the energy hormone. This mimics the natural wake-up process you get when waking up to nature. By controlling when the sun rises in your bedroom, you can minimize fatigue and grogginess every day.Track your movements, playback disturbances, and get a sleep score​ Wireless AudioOnce your sunrise is complete, nature sounds (or your favorite music) gradually increase to ensure you're awake--completing the wake-up experience.Directional speakers ensure only you hear what’s playing. Smart AlarmThe Sunrise Pillow tracks your sleep cycles and wakes you at an optimal time based on your circadian rhythmWe all have an internal clock (aka circadian rhythm) that naturally tells us when to sleep & wake up. The Sunrise Pillow detects your sleep cycle and knows to begin the wake-up process when you're sleeping lightly. Your sunrise will start at the optimal time or up to 15 minutes before your set alarm time--to ensure you wake up feeling fully rested, every day.For example: If you set your alarm for 9:00am but are in a light sleep at 8:50am, your sunrise will start to rise then, rather then letting you fall deeper into sleep and disturbing you later. Traditional alarms aren't smart enough to detect your sleep cycles and go off while you're in a deep sleep. This is why you wake up groggy regardless of how many hours you've slept.Sleep ScoreTake control of your days by improving the quality of your nights. Your sleep score gives you a better understanding of the most important factor of your day; your sleep. With the Sunrise Pillow app, your sleep trends & history show you how exercise, late nights, and even alcohol consumption affect your score, so you can perfect your sleep.Waking up to the latest technology is one thing, but falling asleep to it is taking it to the next level. The Sunrise Pillow is equipped to wake you with a smart alarm and sunrise simulation but it can also put you to sleep with 6-deep sleep options that are sure to put you to sleep faster.  Everything you need to get your best sleep, all in one place.  Supercharge your mornings or reboot after lunch.

Blue light suppresses melatonin (the sleep hormone) and shifts your circadian rhythm twice as much as regular indoor lighting.

Waking from a deep sleep not only sabotages your morning energy & mood but more importantly your daily momentum.When you start the day off groggy you are more likely to make poor choices that turn into a chain reaction that negatively affects your day, week, and year.When you wake up improperly you're likely to:

Spread Nutella on everything
Rescheduling your diet for another day
 Outdoors or on vacation, when the sun rises you feel incredibly excited about the day, and even happier. This is simply because a rising light naturally reduces the sleep hormone (melatonin) and increases our energy hormones before we wake up. By experience your own sunrise, you set the tone for a better day every day. Making the right choices from the moment you wake up will give you positive momentum and affect your:
Food & drink decisions
Work performance
Test scores

Energy levels - to enjoy more time with your family & friends
The way we look at traditional alarms as normal, is outdated. Virtually throwing away 50% of your sleep is unacceptable. Regular alarms neglect our sleep & wake hormones and this needs to change.Waking to light has been gaining a lot of good attention in recent years and we want to take awareness to the next level. So please join us by backing this project at any pledge level and let's tell the world that we want to wake up right and wake up to light.  We used only the highest grade materials when designing the Sunrise Pillow. All of the intelligent components are invisibly embedded deep within premium aerated memory foam. The pillowcase is made with ultra-breathable diamond-quilt fabric to maximize comfort, cooling, and airflow. When creating the sunrise pillow, comfort and materials were at the top of our list.       Both pillow shapes are smart and have the same integrated technology. Make a pledge now and at the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey where you will make your final selection.   Take a look at the list below to see how the Sunrise Pillow stacks up and even includes the most popular and proven sleep devices on the market.  A storage pocket holds the wired remote control; an alternative way to control your Sunrise Pillow. Control everything from your iOS or Android device or use the remote control to adjust volume, reading lights, and even snooze. Conveniently recharge your Sunrise Pillow via Micro USB charging port located on the remote control.  
 


Gyroscope & Accelerometer can detect movement with precision

RGB LEDs simulate the natural sunrise and wake you vibrantly

Microphone in your Sunrise Pillow is ultra sensitive. It analyzes your breathing patterns, detects snoring and noise disturbances through the night

Bluetooth LE to easily change settings, update your Sunrise Pillow's alarm or adjust your sunrise experience

Waterproof internal components are housed in a durable waterproof enclosure.


 

We are Mode | M and we are based in Los Angeles, California. We enjoy being a small design company because it allows us to be agile and listen to feedback, so we can create the most intuitive user friendly products that make a positive impact on all of our lives. Productivity and energy management hold a close place in our hearts because it's a part of our core. Helping the world understand how sleep is the foundation of a better life, we spent thousands of hours sifting through the trends or gimmicks and focused on building only real world proven features that we really think you're going to like. We appreciate the opportunity to earn your business and serving you for many years to come. Thank you for sharing our project with anyone who enjoys a good sunrise.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sean, who is only 25, was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy after being misdiagnosed with bronchitis. He was alergic to the medicine he received for bronchitis, which may have helped damage his kidneys. Sean is also suffering from Cerebral Palsy that he has lived with from the time he was a baby. He was told by doctors that the only thing he can do now is go on dialysis.  </p>
<p>Doctors are also telling him that he will never be able to work again because of this. Sean has also recently become a father to his new baby boy Adam. He is forced to live with his girl friend's parents, because he is unable to maintain a job or afford to pay for a place of his own.</p>
<p>Sean will need dialysis to keep him alive and does not currently have a job or the money to afford insurance; let alone the cost of a life-long confinement to dialysis. He just recently lost his job from missing too much work because of the constant trips he has to take to the doctor. Many of these visits are to get shots to help his body deal with waste, where his kidneys are not working properly.</p>
<p>I am starting this campaign to help raise money for my brother to be able to  live a meaningful life. I hope that we can raise enough to be able to pay for his medical costs until something more long term can be accomplished. I would like for something to be done legally to help him with the problems he now has to live with; because of a lack of diagnostics done by the medical doctor he went to see when he first starting having issues.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I am making the goal $1,000 to help him get started. I would like to get much much more because dialysis costs a lot!</p>
<p>You will be greatly helping to maintain Sean's life and ensuring that his son has a father to help raise him with his mother Jean.</p>
<p>Everything that I raise will go towards helping Sean pay his medical bills. Anything that he receives will help him have a life with his new family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The money that will be raised from this campaign will go towards helping Sean live! Imagine all of the things that he could do for his son and family if only he can stay alive! I cannot even begin to imagine the impact that saving my brothers life will have on him, not to mention his newly born son!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, you can still help by spreading the word through social networks like facebook, twitter, google+, or any other means!

<br/>We are two best friends, trying to raise money for a woman we've never met. When we heard about a woman from Uganda who was attacked with a bucket of acid, and couldn't get to the US to get treatment, we decided to do something about it. It's so rare that we have the opportunity to help one person who needs it, and this woman only needs about $80,000 to change her life forever.</div>

<h3>Meet Christine</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>In
2011 Christine Nakato, 19 <span>years old and unknowingly pregnant,
heard a knock on her front door and went to see who it was. What she found
would change her life forever.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>In
a jealous rage, a disturbed ex-lover of Christine’s
current boyfriend doused her with a bucket of caustic acid,
permanently damaging Christine's face and upper body. Miraculously she and
her child survived but the damage done to both Christine’s
body and spirit was immediate and debilitating.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135327/files/20150106160216-christine.png?1420588936"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Nearly
four years later, Christine <span>now lives in fear every day. If she
leaves her home, she may be stared at, mocked, or even attacked again. Tragically,
many assume that an acid attack survivor must have deserved her
assault.</span></p>

</div></div>","Hi! 

We are two best friends, trying to raise money for a woman we've never met. When we heard about a woman from Uganda who was attacked with a bucket of acid, and couldn't get to the US to get treatment, we decided to do something about it. It's so rare that we have the opportunity to help one person who needs it, and this woman only needs about $80,000 to change her life forever.

Read more about Christine's story below, and please donate if you can. Even $5 would make a huge difference to Christine!

Happy 2015,

Carrie and Claire


Us, eating salad!




Meet Christine 

In
2011 Christine Nakato, 19 years old and unknowingly pregnant,
heard a knock on her front door and went to see who it was. What she found
would change her life forever.

In
a jealous rage, a disturbed ex-lover of Christine’s
current boyfriend doused her with a bucket of caustic acid,
permanently damaging Christine's face and upper body. Miraculously she and
her child survived but the damage done to both Christine’s
body and spirit was immediate and debilitating.



Nearly
four years later, Christine now lives in fear every day. If she
leaves her home, she may be stared at, mocked, or even attacked again. Tragically,
many assume that an acid attack survivor must have deserved her
assault.

Christine is a bright,
energetic woman with a passion for design. She is currently taking tailoring
classes, and before her attack, planned to open her own business. However,
because of her appearance no one will buy from her.


We
are trying to raise $80,000 for Christine in the next two months, to get her to the United States
for intensive surgeries. While major services are donated by the Grossman Burn
Foundation, Christine still needs help for travel to the US,
transportation, room and board, nursing care, medical supplies, and to have a
prosthetic eye made to replace the one destroyed in the attack.
We so rarely have the opportunity to help one person in need so directly, and Christine's story will give other victims hope.    Why Do Acid Attacks Happen? 

Unfortunately,
acid attacks are a grim reality for many people in the developing world.
Because women in Uganda are treated so poorly, almost as possessions of their
male partners, desperate women sometimes try to destroy a former partner's new
""property"" by making her a damaged ""commodity.""
The
facts are shocking:

According to Amnesty International, the
     greatest cause of acid attacks is the marginalization of women.
One
     in every five Ugandans knows an acid attack victim.
16%
     of victims die.
1
     in 4 female survivors are abandoned by their male partners, while only 1
     in 33 male survivors are abandoned by their female partners. 
31%
     of survivors are blind or partially blind.
Almost
     all survivors experience extreme social anxiety and are afraid to leave
     their homes.
In
     order to convict an attacker, a government chemist must confirm that acid
     was used in the attack. Yet there is only one government
     chemist in the entire country. This and other factors make convictions
     rare and punishments meager.

    Your Gift Will Change a Life 

For
Christine, having these surgeries means getting her life back; being able to
leave her home, get an education, and start her own business. It means fighting
back against the war on women in her hometown and serving as a
beacon of resilience for the rest of the world.
Any funds raised above $80,000 will be used
to assist  other acid burn
victims, so that they too can have hope for a better future.

    Other Ways You Can Help 

Even
$1 will help Christine get her life-changing treatments. A gift of $5
represents about one week's income for someone in Uganda.
If
you can't give right now, visit grossmanburnfoundation.org or amnestyusa.org
for more information on what you can do to stop acid attacks. 
Thank you for helping to change Christine's

</h3> <p><b>UPDATE!</b></p>
<p>Tom got THE scholarship to the Australian Brumbies/ASU Development Academy.  AND, he was accepted to the NRFL Combine on January 14th at the LA Coliseum!  He will compete side by side with professional athletes for a chance to play with the first US Rugby League.....<br/></p>
<p>I LOVE RUGBY.  I was just invited to play in the amateur tournament that is part of the IRB Sevens World Series held in Las Vegas every year.  I will compete against 100+ other top athletes for one of 24 places on the elite side team .  Over the course of the week long tournament activities, I will train and compete where national and international coaches will be looking for talent.  This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get the chance to play professionally.</p>
<p>Since being introduced to rugby almost 10 years ago, I have had a fire burning in me to play at a professional level.  Although I have continued to train at competition level, as a husband and father I have had more pressing priorities than chasing my dream.  I recently attended the rigorous ASU/Brumbies combine which happened to be only 1 1/2 hours from where I live.  I caught the attention of world famous Super Rugby Coach Larkham.  He was impressed with my performance and I received top scores at the camp.  I was approached by him personally about a scholarship to attend their development academy.  Rumors of my performance made their way to the right connections and I was promptly invited to compete in Las Vegas.<br/></p>I feel very confident that with this opportunity to compete I will be selected for the elite side team and catch the eye of every coach that sees me play.  I have the full support of my family to pursue this opportunity, however, there are costs associated with it, the same that have made pursuing this dream impossible in the past.  <br/><br/><h3>It's not just a Dream<br/>

</div><div>Rugby is definitely my passion.  I live for competition.  But the opportunity to play professional rugby is a career opportunity and an opportunity for a better life for my family.  I am driven to achieve this success, however, I cannot do it at the expense of my family.  Although there is an inevitable emotional cost,  I am seeking sponsorship to lessen the financial impact on my family. </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Training for Success<br/>
</h3>Although I have already been training at competition level, I will spend the next few months in intense training for the tournament so I can be fully prepared to take advantage of this opportunity.  I am preparing every inch of my body through mental, physical, nutritional and athletic training.  I am training one on one with a coach that is donating his time to help me realize this goal.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>This isn't Easy<br/>
</h3>After running two businesses and raising 3 children, there isn't a lot of time left in the day to train, let alone pursue individual goals that are this intense.  Gratefully, I have the support of my wife and extended family, a network of friends and a sports community that believes in my ability to succeed.  With a little financial support, I will have all I need to make this dream a reality.<br/><br/><h3>You make the difference<br/>

<h2>Samuel's Heart</h2>
<p>OK, let me start out three years ago, before I was even born.  My mom and dad met at a dance, and although they were from two very different countries, fell in love.  They were soon married and expecting their first child, my sister Khanali.  The excitement and anticipation of her arrival only contributed to the love they already formed for her even before she was born.  To their suprise she was ready to come 8 weeks early!  When Khanali was born she was so active and healthy!  Unfortunately she became ill about two weeks later and passed away taking her last breath in my father's arms.  That was so difficult for my mom and dad, but they have slowly overcome some of their grief in her passing and have found joy in my life.  </p>
<p>I was an unexpected blessing for my mom and dad.  They did not think they were able to have another child so soon after my sister, but here I am!  I too could not wait to come into this world and arrived a few weeks early.  Weighing 4lbs. 5 oz I was in the hospital for about two weeks.  I was being tested for multiple things, and while there they found that I have a congenital heart defect.  I also need special formula to keep on my weight.  I may look big, but I still am just 8lbs at three months old.  This has led to multiple visits to the hospital, testing, and more treatment and care that my parents are struggling with.  Although I love the nice nurses because they cuddle with me, I would rather be with my mom and dad, healthy and happy.  I really need help with the expenses of the procedures for my pulmonary stenosis.  One procedure involves putting a little balloon in between the heart valve to widen it.  Although I love balloons, I am a bit nervous if I have one in my heart!  I know after my mom and dad lost my sister, this is very stressful and I just want to ease their burden without having to worry about the funds to pay the medical bills.  Any bit of your contribution will help us cover the expense for my treatment!  With the proper care I know I will grow big and tall like my dad, and maybe even be a Kenyan runner like him!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need help in raising funds to contribute to my medical expenses for my heart and other health issues.  Any contribution will be greatly appreciated.  The $5000 dollars will pay the medical premium for my heart monitor and EKG's and special formula I need to eat to be healthy.  Anything in addition to that will help with other procedures for my pulmonary stenosis.  In return for your kind contribution and gesture we will be forever grateful<a href=""http://www.etsy.com/listing/106904848/birds-nest-necklace-purple-egg-necklace?image_id=365832615"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">!</a>  If a monetary contribution is not something you can do, then please volunteer at a local hospital in the children/infant unit.  They love seeing happy faces and people that care, it helps them take their minds off of why they are there! Thanks again for taking time to read my story, and help me out.  Even a prayer for me would be appreciated! </p>
