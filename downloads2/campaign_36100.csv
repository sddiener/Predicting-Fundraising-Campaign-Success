The company stuff!….</h3><p> </p><p><strong>Our Story </strong></p><p>International Innovation Services was established in 2016. Phoenix is one of three company projects. It is also the most advanced one. Its origins lie in an initiative to help the elderly get to grips with computers. </p><p>Whilst studying for his Master’s degree, IIS Managing Director Daniel Mirfani, already a computer science graduate, began visiting elderly people at their request to help them learn how to use a computer and the internet. During these visits Daniel was struck by how many homes he visited were really cold. His suggestion that the heating might be turned up elicited the response that the heating was too expensive to run. This was Daniel’s first encounter with fuel-poverty. He resolved to find a solution. He built a team of like-minded enthusiasts to work on the project. </p><p>A new concept was developed and tested. The results were very encouraging, however, academics at Oxford Brookes University acting as critical friends identified a number of issues that needed further work.

They dispense with the need for alterations to the dwelling or an external power source to drive a fan. The benefits, however, don't stop there.How does it work?Radiators heat the room via two methods: convection and radiation:However, our device works by capturing heat at the rear of the radiator and then propelling warm air out from the base of the radiator. From there, the heat is able to rise into the living space. This disrupts the typical pattern of convection and radiation that causes heat to accumulate close to the ceiling whilst leaving the occupied space at a sub-optimal temperature. This results in savings in the use of fossil fuel whilst reducing the time it takes to warm the room. It also extends life of the boiler and reduces the boiler’s carbon foot print. Better heat distribution in the room results in improved comfort for the occupants. Set out below are the results of our tests undertaken in a room with and without our technology. Again the image on the left shows a more even distribution of heat.Our tests involved recording the temperature registered on each of 14 thermometers located at different heights and at different points in the room. Each test involved heating a room using just the radiator and then flushing out the warmth and returning the room to the original temperature before augmenting the radiator with our technology and repeating the heating process, carefully recording the readings from each thermometer at regular intervals throughout the heating process in exactly the same sequence.  Significant improvements in performance were recorded in each test. What is more, the pattern of difference was consistent. Reductions in wasted heat are illustrated in the chart that follows:How does our innovation work? A plate with embedded thermo-electric generators are positioned between the radiator and an external wall. This plate serves three purposes:1) It blocks the heat from the radiator heating the wall and then exploits the heat differential between the radiator and the wall. 2) It generates electricity using the temperature difference between the wall and the radiator with an embedded array of thermometric generators. So the colder the external wall upon which the radiator is mounted, the greater the generated power is.3) The generated electricity powers a fan that draws the hot air from behind and through an exhaust located at the base of the radiator.  What the final product will look like? The core technology, clever as it is!, didn’t present us with as great a challenge as the product design itself! We have produced two designs, one that can be installed in a new build and one that can be retrofitted in any older houses. Our aim was to make them both practical and appealing. Our target markets, therefore include both individuals on low or medium incomes whether they are homeowners, landlords, tenants, councils or housing associations.The challenge is to provide both flexibility and choice to all these groups so that they can incur the benefits without significant cost or inconvenience.To achieve these goals we decided to offer an integrated model which we called “Lava”. It incorporates modular flexibility and targets the new build sector. We know that builders are not inclined to increase their costs unnecessarily before selling on to householders. With this in mind, the Lava is designed so that our technology can be fitted to the radiator by the householder after the house has been purchased.Our second design is a retrofit device that we have called the “Chill-beater.” It targets older dwellings occupied by people who do not want the disruption and mess associated with fitting new radiators, many of whom, government statistics suggest, are on lower incomes and may in fact be the victims of fuel poverty. Our aim is to offer a solution that will pay for itself in a winter. The Products: 1) Lava (a product for new built dwellings): contains all the technology that we have been working on in a modular framework. Builders, therefore have the option to sell on with all the technology incorporated or to sell on with just the basic radiator leaving it to the householder to purchase additional modules as and when desired.The basic model will sell at the same price as a conventional model. Householders can then add the thermo-electric module post-purchase along with an integrated pull-up clothes drier if they wish. The Lava with the drier module fully extended along with cross-sectional images are shown below:2) Chill-beater (a product for older dwellings): purchasers simply take the thermo-electric module and slide it behind the radiator. It is then held in place by a compression plate that also acts as a heat sink. The fan assembly and exhaust the clips on to then bottom of the thermo-electric module. The fan assembly is shown below:3) ClingOn (an integrated pull-up clothes drier): This device represents a stylish and practical addition to any standard radiator. It can meet the needs of any householder wishing to dry clothes indoors.Several of these units would eliminate the need for a tumble dryer, thereby, reducing both utility bills and Co2 emissions to the atmosphere. The Cling-on is mounted on the front of a radiator of standard dimensions and places a clothes drying facility at the disposal of the householder by the touch of a button.The transformation from a standard radiator to a radiator sitting within the  Cling-on envelope is shown below:Image 1) Standard radiatorImage 2) The ClingOn with the drier in closed positionImage 3) The ClingOn with the drier in a open position What are our goals and what are we going to do with the money we raise as a result of your backing? It is worth noting that so far, we have spent more than £50,000 pounds of our own money on different aspect of this project (initial breadboard, testing, research, design, patent costs…) but now we simply cannot move forward without additional funds to get the final stage of the project completed. It is for this reason that we are seeking help from people who want to improve their own lifestyle and those of others whilst also seeking to preserve the environment and planet that we all share.The overall plan is to build, test and fineness the fully functioning device.1) First Target: £20,000 With £20,000 we will develop the core technology to its full potential (beyond the prototype phase).This core technology sits at the heart of the two models we are planning to offer. (more information in the next section).2) Second Target: £30,000With £30,000 we will make the casings for the product and finalise the beta testing. 3) Third Target: £40,000Will allow us to add the additional option (the integrated drier - The ClingOn ) to the products. 4) Fourth Target: £80,000We will complete the kite mark, finalise the patent, have the product ready and then will give the licensing rights for the Chill-beater to a non for profit organisation (CIC), so that any profits earned from selling the product will be reinvested into supporting the ones who can ill afford to buy them and other devices presenting environmental challenges to society. Only when we know that people are not suffering from the effects of needless cold will we have fulfilled the Project Phoenix mission. The aims: tackle fuel poverty and global warming The Phoenix project is dedicated to bringing relief to those who are experiencing the real hardship of fuel poverty, along with those who are just managing but for whom saving money is a priority. Some words from our Managing Director Daniel Mirfani:""We are aiming to tackle fuel poverty. A problem faced by a sizeable proportion of the population in many societies in Europe and communities in the US and Canada. People affected by fuel poverty range from the retired and elderly, to the unemployed, to single parents and families on low incomes. We have come across families who have to live in cold conditions while suffering from a range of physical and mental issues, partly caused by the conditions in which they live. We know of parents who have to choose between eating, feeding the children and warming their homes. It was the challenge of fuel poverty that prompted me to sit down and think about how best the issue problem could be addressed. So tackling fuel poverty is a priority for us."" By helping these groups we can also help governments to achieve their climate change targets.Climate change is now the world’s most challenging sustainability issue, it has far reaching consequences for both society and the world’s economy.In the UK, for example, more than 50% of Co2 emissions to the atmosphere come from domestic heating systems.The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas to produce energy and fuel for transport, together with intensive farming, are all releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere whilst deforestation limits the natural carbon sink’s capacity to absorb carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing ‘global warming’ and changing weather conditions across the globe. The main greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide (CO2), of the type emitted by domestic heating systems, although other gases including methane and nitrous oxides are also culpable (Leeds Initiative 2008). Some Ugly Facts:Project Phoenix aims to reduce the Co2 emission from domestic heating systems by up to 20%. So please help us to help you save the planet!Ps. The carbon footprint of a heating technology is measured in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour of heat (gCO2eq/kWh). Carbon dioxide is the most important GHG, so others are measured in CO2 equivalent. Once our aims are met, we will then be able to celebrate together knowing that far fewer people are sleeping in the cold and everyone is working together to help save our planet from global warming. AND NOW......... The company stuff!…. Our Story International Innovation Services was established in 2016. Phoenix is one of three company projects. It is also the most advanced one. Its origins lie in an initiative to help the elderly get to grips with computers. Whilst studying for his Master’s degree, IIS Managing Director Daniel Mirfani, already a computer science graduate, began visiting elderly people at their request to help them learn how to use a computer and the internet. During these visits Daniel was struck by how many homes he visited were really cold. His suggestion that the heating might be turned up elicited the response that the heating was too expensive to run. This was Daniel’s first encounter with fuel-poverty. He resolved to find a solution. He built a team of like-minded enthusiasts to work on the project. A new concept was developed and tested. The results were very encouraging, however, academics at Oxford Brookes University acting as critical friends identified a number of issues that needed further work. The team developed further refinements and ran further breadboard tests. The results were reassuringly positive. In consequence, the decision was made to apply for a patent and establish IIS. The new company’s vision and mission was defined in the following terms.Our VisionThe creation and exploitation of intellectual property to combat climate change challenges. To achieve this we seek to partner with Governments, and Local Administrations on the one hand and corporations and communities on the other. The aim is to deliver products and processes that mitigate the worst effects of extreme weather and other climate change consequences for communities in different parts of the world.Our MissionTo achieve our goals, we seek out partners with the resources and local knowledge necessary to operate in the diverse local contexts in which the environmental problems arise. Achievements to date  2017 Oxford Brookes University Social Enterprise Award - First PrizeGreen Apple Award - Best Product - Houses of Parliament 2017Green World Ambassador 2017 Oxford SME Soup 2017 shortlisted MIAT Prize Shortlisted 2018  Energy Efficiency Champion - Greater London - February 2018 Vulnerable Customer Support Award - Greater London (February 2018)H&V Finalist Awards 2018 (Finale in March) Meet the Team: The believers of a better future Risks and ChallengesWe see the following as potential risks:- Raising the capital to fund the project, hence crowd funding - Our patent applications are challenged - The Beta testing throws up unexpected issues that cause delay - Licensing arrangements take longer than expected to negotiate- Time is crucial and all team members have another full time job to pay for their lives",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

Invention has been my father's passion for his entire life. He never had much resources, though. But that didn't stop him from piling up his creations in the workshop. You know, some of those are like my siblings. And now we are giving this one for early adoption.</p><h3>Why should you care?</h3><p>We all need AgroTech to secure us food in a world dying of hunger.

We will work to keep the product you receive as close to these dimensions as possible and if we make any changes we will be sure to let our backers know. If we do make any alterations they will be small and not to the detriment of any of the requirements that make your BatBnB a great home for bats.</p><p> </p><p><strong>When will I receive my BatBnB?</strong></p><p>BatBnBs are available for immediate shipping! It should arrive within two weeks of placing your order. If you want to track your order, email harrison@batbnb.com any time for updates.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What’s the ideal </strong><strong>placement</strong><strong> for a BatBnB Unit?</strong></p><p>BatBnBs should ideally be placed 15-20 feet from the ground on a wall, shed, barn, or post that receives 6-7+ hours of direct sunlight each day. Keep them away from areas with heavy foot traffic, and make sure the guano can fall into a garden bed where it won't disturb you or anyone in your family -- the garden bed will love the natural fertilizer! While trees can sometimes be a viable option, they should always be a last resort as they often house predators and can obstruct necessary sunlight. Avoid trees if you can.<br/> </p><p><strong>How soon will bats settle into my BatBnB?</strong></p><p>As soon as winter is over, bats are out and about looking for a place to live and raise their families. With the decades of research-backed bat house improvements that every BatBnB has built in, and as long as all of the proper placement tips are followed accurately, Merlin Tuttle estimates BatBnBs to achieve close to a 90% success rate in occupancy. Research has shown that sometimes a new bat house can be inhabited as soon as 24 hours after installation, and other times it can take a few seasons for the bats to find their way there. The best part is that once your friendly neighborhood bug-catchers have moved in, they are very likely to return year after year. If you have met all of the requirements for ideal placement and your BatBnB has still not been occupied after three seasons, try moving the unit to another location. Bats are wild animals who will do as they please, so we cannot guarantee that your unit will become occupied, but with the level of research, quality and effort put towards our designs, you won’t find a bat house on the market with better odds of occupancy than ours.<br/> </p><p><strong>How is BatBnB aiding bat conservation efforts?</strong></p><p>Although there are many causes of bat decline, loss of roosting places has been the most serious. BatBnBs are providing safe and comfortable housing for our bat population while serving as a conversation starter to help you educate your neighbors about the vital importance of bats in the ecosystem. Every bat lost means more toxic pesticides in our food and water. By providing shelter for homeless bats, we can improve the future for all. Additionally, a portion of BatBnB’s proceeds will be donated to various bat conservation organizations. <br/> </p><p><strong>Will bats reduce the number of insects in my yard?</strong></p><p>The impact your BatBnB’s residents will have on the insect population is dependant on how many of them move in, and the prey preferences of their species. Luckily, since bats are hunting at night, they are not preying on butterflies or honey bees. Small Myotis bats are frequent users of bat houses, and research has shown that a single bat is capable of catching up to 1,000 mosquitoes per hour. In Indiana, a colony of 150 big brown bats (about how many bats could live in a medium-sized bat house) was shown to consume enough cucumber beetles to prevent them from laying up to 33 million eggs in a single summer. Free-tailed bats tend to prefer moths, and just one of them can catch enough corn earworm or armyworm moths in one night to prevent the laying of up to 20,000 or more eggs on a wide variety of crops and yard plants. Bats are a gardener’s secret weapon!<br/> </p><p><strong>How do I attract bats to my property?</strong></p><p>Bats live almost anywhere where the climate is moderate and insects are available. The key to attracting them to your BatBnB is the placement. Direct sunlight is the most important aspect, and each unit needs at least 6+ hours each day. Place your BatBNB on the side of a house, barn, or shed between 15-20 feet from the ground. Having a natural water source (pond, stream, brook, etc.) within a mile of your property is ideal, though not a necessity. Small things like water features and night-blooming flowers can also help attract bats.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Are bats safe to have in my yard?</strong></p><p>Yes! Today, there are hundreds of thousands of bats living in American bat houses, and there isn’t a single record of a bat house owner having been harmed by a bat. Millions of tourists have viewed 1.5 million bats close-up in Austin, Texas over the past 35 years, and no one has been attacked or contracted a disease from a bat. Bats have a long-standing history of misrepresentation in popular culture. They are portrayed as blood-sucking vampires and serve as spooky mascots of Halloween. In reality, bats are friendly forest critters that just want to be left alone to eat insects. They are incredibly clean since they groom themselves like cats, and despite popular belief, they are not nesters and have no interest in flying into your hair. It’s important to treat bats with respect, as we do all wildlife. They should never be handled or treated as pets, and in no scenario should a bat ever be approached. If a bat ever does seem injured on the ground or near your house, call an animal control specialist to help you manage the situation.  If you ever want to move your BatBnB unit, wait until winter when the bats have moved on to hibernation and have safely vacated the premises.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will bats ever fly into my house?</strong></p><p>It’s important to treat your new bat friends just like you would any wildlife critters or birds in your yard. Never try to touch or handle the animals. On the very rare occasion that a bat would find its way into your home, call your local animal control, and do not try and handle the bat yourself. In the extremely unlikely event that you are bitten or scratched by a bat, go immediately to the hospital. While the odds are extremely small that the bat was carrying rabies, it is always best to take precautionary action. <br/> </p><p><strong>Are there commercial uses for BatBnB?</strong></p><p>Absolutely! Agricultural research reports often highlight bat populations as an important component of natural pest control for farmers. In fact, bats save the US agricultural industry over $20 Bn in crop damage each year. We will be offering special bulk discounts for farmers and other businesses--such as golf courses, city centers,state parks, hotels, and even local municipalities--that would like to deploy multiple BatBnB units around their property. If you are interested in a bulk order of BatBnBs, email us at christopher@batbnb.com.<br/> </p><p><strong>What if I already have bats in my attic?</strong></p><p>That's actually great! Several leading animal control professionals advertise that once bats are excluded from an attic, they'll try to find a new home nearby in your shed, barn, or even at a neighbor’s house. They recommend putting up a bat house or two further back in your yard to offer the bats an option to quickly relocate without disrupting their summer breeding. This keeps the bats safe and stops them from going back into your attic. Sounds like a win/win in our book.<br/> </p><p><strong>Can I paint my BatBnB?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, you can. In fact, experts have shown that painting a bat house can increase occupancy rates by as much as 50%. Bat houses in warmer areas, such as the southern United States, may benefit from light colored paint, while colder areas, such as the northern U. S. and Canada, may benefit from a darker color to help absorb more warmth from the sun.<br/> </p><p><strong>What do you use for materials?  </strong><br/><br/>We are using kiln dried Western Red Cedar and stainless steel screws. We are only using water based finishes and outdoor grade paints, both of which actually increase occupation rates.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why are bats so important?</strong><br/><br/>Bats are critical. They keep the vast numbers of pests and insects under control, pollinate flowers, and carry seeds for important plants. Bats also safeguard our health by reducing demands for toxic pesticides—one of our planet’s most serious, but too often ignored, health threats.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What if bugs move into my BatBnB?</strong><br/><br/>If unwanted bugs start to make nests in your BatBnB, avoid the use of insect killing pesticides, the residue from a poison will be a deterrent for bats wishing to take up residence. Instead, utilize a stick or some other natural means of removing the unwanted guests.  <br/> </p><p><strong>Why use Cedar?</strong><br/><br/>The greatest reason for utilizing Western Red Cedar is its natural ability to resist rotting when coming into contact with moisture. Because of its thermal properties, it also retains heat very well, keeping the inhabitants warm. It’s also an absolutely beautiful wood. We may explore Northern White Cedar as an alternative option because it is even heartier, and it looks beautiful.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I leave a BatBnB out during the Winter?</strong><br/><br/>Yes! Once you put your BatBnB up in a good location, you shouldn’t have to move it again.<br/> </p><p><strong>How do I account for guano droppings from the unit?</strong><br/><br/>Guano is actually a great fertilizer. Place your BatBnB unit above a garden bed and you’ll have some amazing flowers spring up! Avoid touching or breathing in any guano personally, just as you would normally avoid any wild animal droppings. If you want to know exactly when your BatBnB becomes occupied, you can install a simple wood board 5-10 feet under your BatBnB and watch for when you see guano accumulating.<br/> </p><p><strong>Can I order my BatBnB in a different color?</strong><br/><br/>In order to keep manufacturing costs low, we will not be providing pre-painted BatBnBs. We will, however, include an informational guide with your order that gives recommendations on what colors to use when painting your BatBnB based on your location. Warmer locations can warrant lighter colors, while darker locations you may choose to paint your BatBnB a dark shade of paint.<br/> </p><p><strong>What sort of maintenance does my BatBnB unit require?</strong><br/><br/>Your BatBnB will require relatively little upkeep. The water-based finish will eventually wear down after several years meaning you can embrace the weathering, or chose to refinish it yourself. The bats will not mind, so it’s totally up to your aesthetic preference. With the ¾ inch chamber openings, wasps taking up residence is rare, but it can happen. We recommend cleaning out any wasp nests in the winter to provide a clean and healthy environment for the bats during their next stay. Most guano on the landing pads will wash away with rain, but if it does start accumulating over a season, consider putting on a facemask during the winter and giving the landing pads a quick scrub when the bats are hibernating.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500611041/dzpye0fvdmib7ctscc7w.png"" src=""""/></i></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Follow Us.</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/batbnb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500790420/vjca4omy9fwia0lfdpsz.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/batbnb/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500790441/gbb2kvjiigzuvixjqxse.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://twitter.com/batbnb"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500790454/bodorfsdf1uqitgamsuv.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnYKOsSOghZo_c-WdjRMu7Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500790474/knnkwzhfciajwkrtb8fz.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","A Natural Solution for Backyard PestsBatBnB is the fastest selling bat house in the market with appearances on Entrepreneur Magazine's Elevator Pitch web series as well as CBS's Emmy Award winning tv show Henry Ford's Innovation Nation with Mo Rocca. To date we've shipped over 500 BatBnB units to 48 states and 7 countries.

BatBnB has combined the best of sculptural and ecological design to produce a truly beautiful product range that allows people to do their part to support threatened bat populations. Production like BatBnB are a step in the right direction for balancing our needs with those of the species we live alongside."" BatBnB is important not only for pest control but also to help dispel misconceptions about bats. Bats are not as scary as popular media leads you to believe. There are literally hundreds of thousands of bats living in bat houses across North America, and there isn't a single record of a bat house owner being harmed by a bat. BatBnB is a valuable tool to educate kids about valuable animals in the ecosystem and to spark conversations with friends and family about local wildlife. Featured InChoose your design.Every BatBnB is made from sustainably sourced, rot-resistant cedar and has a water based finish to further protect it in the outdoors.(Mammoth temporarily discontinued, but will be brought back later in the summer)How it Works.Each unit can be placed on a wall, shed, barn or pole in your yard. When local bats emerge from hibernation, they'll find your BatBnB and gladly call it home.The chambers are nice and tight for the bats to huddle comfortably. The interior surfaces offer gripping grooves for climbing and hanging while a chamber passage allows the inhabitants to move from chamber to chamber inside. Ventilation openings on both sides of the unit offer cooling airflow in the lower half of the chamber, while the upper half retains its heat offering a level of climate control to the bats living inside.All our product specifications are based on decades of scientific research into the most successful bat houses, as well as cutting edge input from bat researchers and experts in the field.We're better than the competition.The vast majority of bat houses on the market suffer from one or both of the following problems:1. They are not designed properly for the animal. The houses are too small, lack adequate ventilation shafts, and they don’t have large enough landing pads or adequate grip inside the chambers. These houses are not expert recommended.2. They aren’t aesthetically pleasing. Most models on the market (especially the cheap ones) are unappealing and won’t add any style to your yard. You’ll most likely tuck it away as opposed to showing it off as a design piece that accents your home. BatBnB houses are recommended by the experts. BatBnB has product endorsements from two of the world’s leading authorities on bats. Rob Mies, former Executive Director of the Organization for Bat Conservation, who is sort of like the Beyoncé of the bat world, with appearances on Conan and Ellen, as well as Merlin Tuttle, the founder of Merlin Tuttle's Bat Conservation. Think of Tuttle as the Indiana Jones of the bat community. We are one of only two bat house designs that he has personally endorsed over his 50 year career. That’s some credibility. "" """"Seeing well intended people disappointed by cheap, ""imitation"" bat houses troubles me greatly. It gives good conservation a bad name. The BatBnB line of houses is the first to be developed for mass sale that meets all my personal criteria. I have been involved in the design and construction of these houses from the beginning and am happy to endorse them as unsurpassed in meeting  bat needs, resisting deterioration, and still looking great."" Oh, and did we mention that we'll be setting up a BatBnB for Adrien Grenier's mom? Not only is Adrian an acclaimed actor and social activist, but also a United Nations Environment Goodwill Ambassador who has taken an interest in our product and the bat conservation movement. "" """"One of my favorite words as a conservationist is symbiosis. It's the symbiotic way in which humans and plants and animals can live together in mutual benefit. So when bats got on my radar... or my sonar... oh, my echolocation, I got really excited because you know what, bats eat mosquitoes and where my mom lives in Long Island, there's a big mosquito problem, so I'm gonna get one of these bat houses, for some bats so they come live with us and help us reduce our mosquitoes."" BatBnB is a top-tier product that’s incomparable.

Luckily, since bats are hunting at night, they are not preying on butterflies or honey bees. Small Myotis bats are frequent users of bat houses, and research has shown that a single bat is capable of catching up to 1,000 mosquitoes per hour. In Indiana, a colony of 150 big brown bats (about how many bats could live in a medium-sized bat house) was shown to consume enough cucumber beetles to prevent them from laying up to 33 million eggs in a single summer. Free-tailed bats tend to prefer moths, and just one of them can catch enough corn earworm or armyworm moths in one night to prevent the laying of up to 20,000 or more eggs on a wide variety of crops and yard plants. Bats are a gardener’s secret weapon! How do I attract bats to my property?Bats live almost anywhere where the climate is moderate and insects are available. The key to attracting them to your BatBnB is the placement. Direct sunlight is the most important aspect, and each unit needs at least 6+ hours each day. Place your BatBNB on the side of a house, barn, or shed between 15-20 feet from the ground. Having a natural water source (pond, stream, brook, etc.) within a mile of your property is ideal, though not a necessity. Small things like water features and night-blooming flowers can also help attract bats. Are bats safe to have in my yard?Yes! Today, there are hundreds of thousands of bats living in American bat houses, and there isn’t a single record of a bat house owner having been harmed by a bat. Millions of tourists have viewed 1.5 million bats close-up in Austin, Texas over the past 35 years, and no one has been attacked or contracted a disease from a bat. Bats have a long-standing history of misrepresentation in popular culture. They are portrayed as blood-sucking vampires and serve as spooky mascots of Halloween. In reality, bats are friendly forest critters that just want to be left alone to eat insects. They are incredibly clean since they groom themselves like cats, and despite popular belief, they are not nesters and have no interest in flying into your hair. It’s important to treat bats with respect, as we do all wildlife. They should never be handled or treated as pets, and in no scenario should a bat ever be approached. If a bat ever does seem injured on the ground or near your house, call an animal control specialist to help you manage the situation.  If you ever want to move your BatBnB unit, wait until winter when the bats have moved on to hibernation and have safely vacated the premises. Will bats ever fly into my house?It’s important to treat your new bat friends just like you would any wildlife critters or birds in your yard. Never try to touch or handle the animals. On the very rare occasion that a bat would find its way into your home, call your local animal control, and do not try and handle the bat yourself. In the extremely unlikely event that you are bitten or scratched by a bat, go immediately to the hospital. While the odds are extremely small that the bat was carrying rabies, it is always best to take precautionary action.  Are there commercial uses for BatBnB?Absolutely! Agricultural research reports often highlight bat populations as an important component of natural pest control for farmers. In fact, bats save the US agricultural industry over $20 Bn in crop damage each year. We will be offering special bulk discounts for farmers and other businesses--such as golf courses, city centers,state parks, hotels, and even local municipalities--that would like to deploy multiple BatBnB units around their property. If you are interested in a bulk order of BatBnBs, email us at christopher@batbnb.com. What if I already have bats in my attic?That's actually great! Several leading animal control professionals advertise that once bats are excluded from an attic, they'll try to find a new home nearby in your shed, barn, or even at a neighbor’s house. They recommend putting up a bat house or two further back in your yard to offer the bats an option to quickly relocate without disrupting their summer breeding. This keeps the bats safe and stops them from going back into your attic. Sounds like a win/win in our book. Can I paint my BatBnB?Yes, you can. In fact, experts have shown that painting a bat house can increase occupancy rates by as much as 50%. Bat houses in warmer areas, such as the southern United States, may benefit from light colored paint, while colder areas, such as the northern U. S. and Canada, may benefit from a darker color to help absorb more warmth from the sun. What do you use for materials?  We are using kiln dried Western Red Cedar and stainless steel screws. We are only using water based finishes and outdoor grade paints, both of which actually increase occupation rates. Why are bats so important?Bats are critical. They keep the vast numbers of pests and insects under control, pollinate flowers, and carry seeds for important plants. Bats also safeguard our health by reducing demands for toxic pesticides—one of our planet’s most serious, but too often ignored, health threats. What if bugs move into my BatBnB?If unwanted bugs start to make nests in your BatBnB, avoid the use of insect killing pesticides, the residue from a poison will be a deterrent for bats wishing to take up residence. Instead, utilize a stick or some other natural means of removing the unwanted guests.   Why use Cedar?The greatest reason for utilizing Western Red Cedar is its natural ability to resist rotting when coming into contact with moisture. Because of its thermal properties, it also retains heat very well, keeping the inhabitants warm. It’s also an absolutely beautiful wood. We may explore Northern White Cedar as an alternative option because it is even heartier, and it looks beautiful. Can I leave a BatBnB out during the Winter?Yes! Once you put your BatBnB up in a good location, you shouldn’t have to move it again. How do I account for guano droppings from the unit?Guano is actually a great fertilizer. Place your BatBnB unit above a garden bed and you’ll have some amazing flowers spring up! Avoid touching or breathing in any guano personally, just as you would normally avoid any wild animal droppings. If you want to know exactly when your BatBnB becomes occupied, you can install a simple wood board 5-10 feet under your BatBnB and watch for when you see guano accumulating. Can I order my BatBnB in a different color?In order to keep manufacturing costs low, we will not be providing pre-painted BatBnBs. We will, however, include an informational guide with your order that gives recommendations on what colors to use when painting your BatBnB based on your location. Warmer locations can warrant lighter colors, while darker locations you may choose to paint your BatBnB a dark shade of paint. What sort of maintenance does my BatBnB unit require?Your BatBnB will require relatively little upkeep. The water-based finish will eventually wear down after several years meaning you can embrace the weathering, or chose to refinish it yourself. The bats will not mind, so it’s totally up to your aesthetic preference. With the ¾ inch chamber openings, wasps taking up residence is rare, but it can happen. We recommend cleaning out any wasp nests in the winter to provide a clean and healthy environment for the bats during their next stay. Most guano on the landing pads will wash away with rain, but if it does start accumulating over a season, consider putting on a facemask during the winter and giving the landing pads a quick scrub when the bats are hibernating.Follow Us.",41.0,1,"2 Campaigns

LiVolta will create new industries and in turn create millions of job opportunities that will boost economies worldwide. By contributing to this campaign, you will not only be participating in a worthwhile endeavor,  you will also be sending a message; that people can make something happen faster, better and for less money than governments.LiVolta is a move toward to a cleaner safer and more sustainable environment, it will also serve a larger number of consumers, and give them another choice. it will create new industries and intern create millions of job opportunities that will boost economies worldwide.Risks & ChallengesNew ideas are most often met with criticism by naysayers, and they will always try to discredit them because it is in their interest to do so.We have all heard the promises and have seen slick sales pitches for every kind of so-called “new energy technology”, that would  supposedly change the world. We have also seen the billions of dollars poured into them; only to find out they were nothing more than snake oil.The fact is you can’t change the laws of physics, put simply when it comes to energy you can’t get something from nothing. We are not trying to rewrite the laws of physics or make unsubstantiated claims; we are simply taking some proven technologies and incorporating them with new technologies to arrive at a practical and affordable system that has the potential to help humanity.Large undertakings are never easy; they come with many long days and sleepless nights. This project will have many of the same problems and challenges that any large project of this scope has; and new ones. You can never foresee or be completely prepared for all of them, but we believe there is no problem we can’t overcome.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute we understand, however you can help by letting everyone you know about the campaign through social media and Indiegogo’s share tools.Also If you have any government connections anywhere in the world, connections at the UN or any environmental agency please let them know about LiVolta.It is greatly appreciated, and from all of us here at LiVolta, thank you.Email: info@LiVolta.comSubscribe for updates: livoltaenergy.launchrock.com/LiVolta.comTwitter.com/LiVoltaEnergyFacebook.com/LiVolta",14.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Earthly and Our Product</h3>
<p>We started out as five MBA students assigned to a nine-month project, in search of a topic. The charge was vague and broad: pick a world problem and try to solve it with a sustainable business model. It was difficult finding something we were all passionate about, but after a meal and a few drinks we found our topic--food waste.</p>
<p>Today, we collect food waste from nearby businesses and feed it to a certain species of worms. Their manure is a really powerful, all-natural type of fertilizer called ""worm castings."" Because they work so well, they've even earned the nickname ""black gold"" among enthusiasts. Check out this lemon tree grown with our product, fruiting in a window...in New England...in FEBRUARY.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488238322/rh5fknzznick6gbsmje9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What’s great about our worm castings is that they’re made from food waste, so that lemon tree is literally cycling food waste back into the production of food. Nature is amazing, isn’t it? We think so too.</p>
<p>Although they can also be used to grow most food crops, worm castings have become particularly popular with cannabis growers, many of whom have strong incentive to maximize yields and improve product quality without the use of chemical fertilizers. Cannabis growers have spread a lot of awareness about worm castings and actually advanced many techniques in using them.</p>
<p>We at Earthly see a tremendous opportunity to use this example to demonstrate the potential to close an open loop in society at large. By harnessing natural processes to convert food waste into fertilizer, we not only save space in landfills, but we also offset carbon that would have been emitted producing the chemical fertilizer our customers would use instead of worm castings.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>At this stage in our company's growth, demand for our product from the cannabis industry is far greater than our current production capacity. We need funding to purchase more equipment and pay for labor to allow us to process a greater volume of food waste, and to help us supply more product to keep in step with growing demand. </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of how we'll spend our goal of $20,000:</p>
<p><strong>$6,000</strong> for worm habitats, the units in which our worms live and eat.</p>
<p><strong>$1,000 </strong>to purchase worms to expand our working population.</p>
<p><strong>$4,000</strong> to build or purchase basic equipment, such as a screening machine to refine our final product, and other basic essentials like buckets, scales, and processing equipment.</p>
<p><strong>$2,000</strong> to pre-pay three months of rent for our expansion, which is necessary to support us while we wait for our new production to become market-ready.</p>
<p><strong>$1,000</strong> to purchase raw materials to use in crafting potting soil mixes.</p>
<p><strong>$6,000</strong> to cover the costs of labor until we can begin harvesting our product.</p>
<p>If we don't meet 100% of our goal, we'll spend the money starting at the top of this list and work our way down until we've exhausted the funds. If we exceed our fundraising goal, we'll use the extra funds to increase our production capacity even further (as much as our current space will allow). After that, we'll use any additional funds to support the labor needs of the business until our new production begins generating revenue.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All of the funds you contribute will go directly to helping Earthly save food waste from ending up in a landfill, minimizing its carbon footprint and turning it into a high-quality end product. Once we refine our model further, we plan to replicate it in other cities throughout the United States to maximize our impact.</p>
<h3>Can't Contribute? No Problem. Just Spread the Word!</h3>
<p>Believe us, we know what it's like when money is tight. But you can still help! Simply share our campaign on social media and with friends, family, your crazy, passionate, environmentalist aunt, or whoever you think might be interested in knowing about us. Your voice is a powerful tool!</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read about us, and happy growing!</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>JMCC WING, LLC – one of five finalists in Water Abundance XPRIZE powered by Tata Group and Australian Aid</strong></p>
<p>March 22, 2018 (South Point, Hawaii) -- Using two technology advancements, JMCC WING, LLC (Delaware) qualified for a $50,000 Milestone Award in the <a href=""https://water.xprize.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Water Abundance XPRIZE powered by Tata Group and Australian Aid</a>.  The competition began with 98 teams worldwide and now five finalist teams have been selected to compete in the final round for the Grand Prize this July (2018) to efficiently harvest water from air using renewable energy.  The McCanney WING Generator (Patents pending – JMCC WING<sup>TM</sup>) is the power source for their line of Atmospheric Water Generators.   This ushers in “The Jet Age of Wind Energy” according to owner and inventor Physicist James McCanney.</p>
<p>The Water Abundance XPRIZE requires the atmospheric water to cost less than two cents per liter using only renewable energy.  Teams cannot use grid power.   Standard alternative energy sources such as the three blade wind generators or solar are far too expensive to meet this low figure.  Enter McCanney’s invention the WING Generator, which can scale to very large sizes.  McCanney says “someday the WING will scale large enough to replace nuclear and coal fired electrical power plants with a single unit.”   Other WING applications include energy for pumping water, desalinization, farms, car charging stations, compressed air, mining (both physical and crypto mining) and more.  </p>

</div></div>","JMCC WING, LLC – one of five finalists in Water Abundance XPRIZE powered by Tata Group and Australian Aid
March 22, 2018 (South Point, Hawaii) -- Using two technology advancements, JMCC WING, LLC (Delaware) qualified for a $50,000 Milestone Award in the Water Abundance XPRIZE powered by Tata Group and Australian Aid.  The competition began with 98 teams worldwide and now five finalist teams have been selected to compete in the final round for the Grand Prize this July (2018) to efficiently harvest water from air using renewable energy.  The McCanney WING Generator (Patents pending – JMCC WINGTM) is the power source for their line of Atmospheric Water Generators.   This ushers in “The Jet Age of Wind Energy” according to owner and inventor Physicist James McCanney.
The Water Abundance XPRIZE requires the atmospheric water to cost less than two cents per liter using only renewable energy.  Teams cannot use grid power.   Standard alternative energy sources such as the three blade wind generators or solar are far too expensive to meet this low figure.  Enter McCanney’s invention the WING Generator, which can scale to very large sizes.  McCanney says “someday the WING will scale large enough to replace nuclear and coal fired electrical power plants with a single unit.”   Other WING applications include energy for pumping water, desalinization, farms, car charging stations, compressed air, mining (both physical and crypto mining) and more.  
The WING is Eco-Friendly.  Birds see it and fly around.  There will be only a few not thousands covering the landscape.  They are graceful and beautiful people love to watch them.  They are silent (no high vibration or noise) and are easily maintained since all heavy equipment is on ground level.
McCanney states that since the WING works efficiently from low to very high wind speeds, its patented design extracts far more energy than previous wind generators.  The cost per unit of energy goes down exponentially with increasing size.   His “Distributed Energy” philosophy, published in his 2009 book “McCanney WING Generator – World Energy Project”, shows how one day a distributed network of large WING Generators will power all our energy needs including electric transportation, while providing clean water for the world. 
The JMCC WING Team needs your support to bring this technology to fruition and not only win the Water Abundance XPRIZE, but also bring this into full manufacturing for the vast world market.   We can finally bring an end to lack of energy and water for the 3.5 billion people in the world who lack these basic necessities.   With reliable inexpensive energy and water, the people will produce food and have hygiene and a new way of life.   We are on the verge of changing the world with these emergent technologies.

<p>Hey everyone!  My name is Enayat, and I am the inventor of the Hummingbrush.  At the young age of about 4 years old, I was more fascinated with how my toys worked &amp; how they were made, than actually playing with them.  I remember being so mesmerized by holograms on cereal boxes, that I completely forgot about the toys inside.  My passion to build led me to be featured on CNBC's 'Make Me A Millionaire Inventor' (Season 1, Episode 6). The opportunity alone was enough to help me to further pursue product development and business management.</p>

on

CNBC 'Make Me A Millionaire Inventor'
Twisty Tint
(Season 1, Episode 6 ""Reinventing the Wheel"")
Hey everyone!  My name is Enayat, and I am the inventor of the Hummingbrush.  At the young age of about 4 years old, I was more fascinated with how my toys worked & how they were made, than actually playing with them.  I remember being so mesmerized by holograms on cereal boxes, that I completely forgot about the toys inside.  My passion to build led me to be featured on CNBC's 'Make Me A Millionaire Inventor' (Season 1, Episode 6). The opportunity alone was enough to help me to further pursue product development and business management.

SONIC TECHNOLOGY

 
So now I am here trying to take this a step further to introduce the world's 1st fully automated sonic makeup brush cleaning machine.  My ultimate creation to date.The Hummingbrush PRO will usher in a NEW STANDARD of clean for the cosmetic industry.  It will set Sonic Technology at the forefront for cleaning makeup brushes and promote beauty hygiene worldwide.

<p>Our initial scouting trip in June of 2016 introduced us to two villages where we could make an impact with our solution; Torotoro and Pampa Jasi.

<h2>(La version française se trouve plus pas)</h2>
<h2>English Summary</h2>
<p>Energy independence implies well dimensioned alternative systems to ensure continued production of electricity and drinking water in of a remote dwelling while reducing its Green House Gas emissions footprint even in prolonged absence of direct solar energy. This breakthrough technology is called to participate in the third industrial revolution: It is born of a convergence of communication technologies and renewable energy. This revolution could open the door to a new post-fossil energy era and where unnecessary and too costly nuclear power, is replaced by a micro-power constellation networked operating somewhat on the model of decentralized Internet.. This eliminates the need for expensive wastewater treatment plants.</p>
<p>This revolutionary technology solves the problem of water scarcity and the energy crisis considering to the expected demographic explosion, provides solutions to reduce the environmental impact of urbanization while offering alternative solutions to reduce water, soil and air pollution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Module 1 generates steam</li>
<li>Module 2 generates electric power and store it if necessary</li>
<li>Module 3 generates drinking water and store it</li>
<li>Module 4 enables communication between modules and between systems</li>
</ul>
<p>We are 3 partners in the Bio-S-TEAM company:</p>
<p><strong>Ismael Aduayom</strong>: He is the project leader: derived from the knowledge he acquired during his Master’s Degree in Population Biology and Ecosystems from the University Paris VI (including fluid mechanics skills and Astronomy), he studied biotechnology at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and heavy metal toxicity during his Ph.D (UQAM) and worked  in ecotoxicology (TOXEN, Canada).</p>
<p><strong>Fred Elisma</strong>: having both a Masters in Biology and in Bioinformatics (UQAM), he has 10-years’ experience as a software developer. He is in charge of the automation and the website.</p>
<p><strong>Mélanie Grondin</strong>: having a Ph.D in Biochemistry (UQAM), she is expert in persistent toxic substances and studied the Tributyltin toxicity. She is in charge of partnerships.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we need :</h3>
<p>The minimum we need is 90 000 € to hire 3 engineers (a mechanical Engineer, a steam process Engineer, an electrical Engineer), and rent an appropriate workshop to build up the final prototype in a sunny area (in Spain).</p>
<p>The Proof of concept has already been established. Since we are collaborating with a Public Laboratory (CNAM - Paris), if the fundraising does not reach its objective, the funds will be used as financial guarantee to raise money at the bank to finance this collaboration.</p>
<h3>What you get:</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount of your contribution, you may get:</p>
<p><u>For a contribution of 10 € and more:</u></p>
<p>A subscription to the quarterly newsletter detailing the progress of the project (and your name mentioned as contributor is you agree).</p>
<p><u>For a contribution of 300 € and more</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the above and your coordinates if desired (email address or facebook link) on our website with the indication that you sponsored a local company of your choice*  training to build up the system.</li>
<li>A video of the micro power plant operating at a location.</li>
</ol>
<p>*  The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum or maximum turnover, a number of employees , its willing to comply with our policy... You may propose a company of your choice but this company should meet our social criteria (social and solidarity economy) and the skills (building construction public works - technical installations). Otherwise, you can pick up one company among the list of companies we will provide to you.</p>
<p><u>For a contribution of 500 € and more</u>:</p>
<p>All the above and the sponsorship for the internet access to technical specifications for the construction of the system for yourself and a local company of your choice* for one year.</p>
<p>*  The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum or maximum turnover, a number of employees, its willing to comply with our policy... You may propose a company of your choice but this company should meet our social criteria and the skills (building construction public works - technical installations). Otherwise, you can pick up one company among the list of companies we will provide to you.</p>
<p><u>For a contribution of 1 000 € and more</u>:</p>
<p>All the above and the sponsorship for the construction* of the module 1 (generating steam) at one location** of your choice: it may be your location if you desire (for which you will be kept updated when the technology is ready after certification by local authorities).</p>
<p>* This amount covers only the work force cost and neither the additional material cost nor the automation of the system.</p>
<p>** Any location that do not receive a solar flux above 1 000 W/m<sup>2</sup> (usually, outside the tropical area) is unfit and any location where the local regulation prohibit such a construction is unfit. Otherwise, you can choose to sponsorship the people who will benefit from this technology. You may designate us the beneficiary of your choice or choose from a list of potential beneficiaries that we propose. Please note that if you designate a beneficiary of your choice outside the list of potential beneficiaries, you have the obligation to indicate a company that is willing to build the micro powerplant.</p>
<p><u>For a contribution of 2 000 € and more</u>:</p>
<p>All the above and the additional material cost for the automation of whole the system (module 1 and/or module 2 and /or module 3). Please note that the cost of building modules 2 and / or 3 is not taken into account and remains at your charge.</p>
<p><u>For a contribution of 5 000 € and more</u>:</p>
<p>All the above and the maintenance contract with the local company* of your choice for 2 years.</p>
<p>Please note that the cost of building modules 2 and / or 3 is not taken into account and remains at your charge.</p>
<p>* The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum or maximum turnover, a number of employees , its willing to comply with our policy...</p>
<h3>What you don't get:</h3>
<p>Module 2, generating Electric Power and Module 3 generating drinking water. For these 2 modules, you would need to finance it by paying the local installer. However, if you sponsored the training of this local company, you might be in position to ask for a reduction on the prices!</p>
<p>The prices of modules 1, 2, 3 and 4 varies according to :</p>
<ul>
<li>the cost of local labor</li>
<li>the cost of local material</li>
<li>the cost of local taxes and fees incurred by local regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the modeling of the price based on an average of the labor cost in Europe, the applied taxes and the administrative costs table on an average price of :</p>
<p>€ 11 500 for module 1 (producing steam)</p>
<p>€ 10 500 for module 2 (producing electric power)</p>
<p>€ 5 500 for module 3 (producing drinking water)</p>
<p>€ 1 200 for module 4 (automation)</p>
<p>Since the construction is local, these theoretical prices may vary according the country where the micro power plant is built. Please note that the cost of installation of photovoltaic panels (which does not produce drinking water) is similar to module 1 &amp; 2 producing electric power for a medium size dwelling.</p>
<h2>The Impact:</h2>
<p>In a context marked by the increase in world population and the accelerated renewal needs in terms of energy, raw materials, products and services, environmental changes take an enhanced sharpness, from landscape scale to that of the planet (climate, pollution of fresh and marine waters, etc.). There is a strong need to maintain a rational management of resources to adapt to the climate changes in progress.</p>
<p>This project is also social innovations as regards to succeed, thanks to technology. The implementation of the third industrial revolution should help produce and manufacture on site to avoid or reduce environmental impacts, rehabilitate environments, favoring ecological compensation. Sustainable management of natural resources is a major focus of this project to meet the challenges of the energy transition.</p>
<p>The economic innovation must allow accompanying the ecological transition. The need to implement a sustainable competitiveness (with the corresponding jobs and social cohesion Research), wealth-building needs (minimizing resource consumption), environmental requirements (CO<sub>2</sub> and water footprints, energy saving, reduction of pollution, elimination of toxic substances, saving natural resources, recycling) are all societal aspects considered in this project to stimulate industrial renewal and promote economic development.</p>
<p>It is expected that in the tropics, solar energy can be efficiently converted into electricity during 4 to 6 hours per day (for days enjoying a continuous sunshine). Thus, the micro power plant would theoretically reduce the use of fossil or nuclear energy from 17 to 25%. Hence and considering that renewables are freely accessible, the use of the micro power plant would simultaneously produce drinking water and electricity allowing a saving on energy bills of emerging countries. The socio-economic impact is all the more important as the product itself is a source of comfort improvement by allowing increasing access to safe drinking water and generates employment for micro power plant maintenance.</p>

<h2>Risks ans Challenges</h2>
<p>Since the solar concentrating system has already been developed and only the automation of the sun tracking system on its two axes is missing for the submission of the patent application on a solar concentrator. The remaining obstacles concern only 5 points:</p>
<p>1. The modelization of the powers exchanged at the concentrator level and the automatic control of the pressure, the temperature and the flow of liquid water and steam. This is the mission of the CNAM laboratory whose work will help us to establish the automatic control protocols, the choice of sensors and the best strategy to maintain the user's safety when the micro power plant is operating. This may take some time to automate the device, which is why we need an electro-technician.</p>
<p>2. The design of the steam micro turbines is already modeled. However, the differences in properties between the compressed air used to carry out the tests and the steam could vary the expected results, making the final production of the turbine more complex and therefore more expensive (risks associated with erosion by water's droplets). In this case, and rather than persisting in this way, there is already a simple alternative in case of difficulty: the Tesla turbine that is adaptable to the project. The challenge here is to produce a simple design and manufacture a flywheel that is robust and inexpensive and can be combined with a speed reducer with the same qualities. That is why we need a talented mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>3. This engineer should also study the proposed solution to increase the combustion rate of the engine and verify that this solution achieves the desired result. Several scientific publications on this subject have already reported satisfactory results.</p>
<p>4. Finally, the financial risks associated with the strategy for filing patent applications should not be overlooked. These patents are supposed to protect small businesses from the economic power of large firms that can impose market prices and reduce the beneficial effect of competition.

<h3><strong>Ce que vous n'obtenez pas:</strong></h3>
<p>Module 2, générant de l'électricité et module 3 générant de l'eau potable. Pour ces 2 modules, vous devez le financer en payant le programme d'installation local. Cependant, si vous avez parrainé la formation de cette entreprise locale, vous pourriez être en mesure de demander une réduction sur les prix!</p>
<p>Les prix des modules 1, 2, 3 et 4 varient selon:</p>
<p>• le coût de la main d'œuvre locale</p>
<p>• le coût du matériel local</p>
<p>• le coût des taxes locales et des frais encourus par les réglementations locales</p>
<p>Cependant, la modélisation du prix basé sur une moyenne du coût de la main-d'œuvre en Europe, des taxes appliquées et du tableau des frais administratifs sur un prix moyen de:</p>
<p>11 500 € pour le module 1 (production de vapeur)</p>
<p>10 500 € pour le module 2 (production d'énergie électrique)</p>
<p>5 500 € pour le module 3 (production d'eau potable)</p>
<p>1 200 € pour le module 4 (automatisation)</p>
<p>Étant donné que la construction est locale, ces prix théoriques peuvent varier selon le pays où la micro-centrale est construite. Veuillez noter que le coût de l'installation des panneaux photovoltaïques (qui ne produisent pas d'eau potable) est similaire au cout des modules 1 et 2 produisant de l'énergie électrique pour un logement de taille moyenne.</p>
<h2><strong>L'impact:</strong></h2>
<p>Dans un contexte marqué par l'augmentation de la population mondiale et les besoins de renouvellement accélérés en termes d'énergie, de matières premières, de produits et de services, les changements environnementaux prennent une netteté accrue, de l'échelle du paysage à celle de la planète (climat, Eaux, etc.). Il y a un grand besoin de maintenir une gestion rationnelle des ressources pour s'adapter aux changements climatiques en cours.</p>
<p>Ce projet a aussi des innovations sociales qui profitent de la technologie. La mise en œuvre de la troisième révolution industrielle devrait aider à produire et à fabriquer sur place pour éviter ou réduire les impacts environnementaux, réhabiliter les milieux, favoriser la compensation écologique. La gestion durable des ressources naturelles est un axe majeur de ce projet pour relever les défis de la transition énergétique.</p>
<p>L'innovation économique doit permettre d'accompagner la transition écologique. La nécessité de mettre en place une compétitivité durable (avec les emplois correspondants et la cohésion sociale), les besoins en matière de création de richesse (minimiser la consommation de ressources), les exigences environnementales (CO2 et empreintes d'eau, économies d'énergie, réduction de la pollution, élimination des substances toxiques) Ressources, recyclage) sont tous des aspects sociétaux considérés dans ce projet pour stimuler le renouveau industriel et promouvoir le développement économique.</p>
<p>On s'attend à ce que dans les tropiques, l'énergie solaire puisse être efficacement convertie en électricité pendant 4 à 6 heures par jour (pendant des jours jouissant d'un soleil continu). Ainsi, la micro-centrale réduirait théoriquement l'utilisation de l'énergie fossile ou nucléaire de 17 à 25%. Par conséquent et considérant que les énergies renouvelables sont librement accessibles, l'utilisation de la micro-centrale produirait simultanément de l'eau potable et de l'électricité permettant une économie sur les factures d'énergie des pays émergents. L'impact socio-économique est d'autant plus important que le produit lui-même est une source d'amélioration du confort en permettant un meilleur accès à l'eau potable et génère un emploi pour la maintenance des micro-centrales.</p>
<h2><strong>Risques et défis</strong></h2>
<p>Etant donné que le système de concentration solaire a déjà été développé et que seule l'automatisation du système de suivi solaire sur ses deux axes manque pour la soumission de la demande de brevet sur un concentrateur solaire. Les autres obstacles ne concernent que 5 points:</p>
<p>1. La modélisation des puissances échangées au niveau du concentrateur et le contrôle automatique de la pression, de la température et du flux d'eau liquide et de vapeur. C'est la mission du laboratoire CNAM qui nous aidera à établir les protocoles de contrôle automatique, le choix des capteurs et la meilleure stratégie pour maintenir la sécurité de l'utilisateur lors de la mise en service de la micro-centrale. Cela peut prendre un certain temps pour automatiser l'appareil, c'est pourquoi nous avons besoin d'un électro-technicien.</p>
<p>2. La conception des microturbines à vapeur est déjà modélisée. Cependant, les différences de propriétés entre l'air comprimé utilisé pour la réalisation des essais et la vapeur peuvent faire varier les résultats escomptés, ce qui rend la production finale de la turbine plus complexe et donc plus onéreuse (risque associé à l'érosion par les gouttelettes). Dans ce cas, et plutôt que de persister de cette voie, il y a déjà une alternative simple en cas de difficulté: la turbine Tesla qui est adaptable au projet. Le défi ici est de produire une conception simple et fabriquer un volant qui est robuste et peu coûteux et peut être combiné avec un réducteur de vitesse avec les mêmes qualités. C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin d'un ingénieur mécanicien talentueux.</p>
<p>3. Cet ingénieur doit également étudier la solution proposée pour augmenter la vitesse de combustion du moteur et vérifier que cette solution atteint le résultat souhaité. Plusieurs publications scientifiques sur ce sujet ont déjà donné des résultats satisfaisants.</p>
<p>4. Enfin, les risques financiers associés à la stratégie de dépôt des demandes de brevet ne doivent pas être négligés. Ces brevets sont censés protéger les petites entreprises du pouvoir économique des grandes entreprises qui peuvent imposer les prix du marché et réduire l'effet bénéfique de la concurrence. Si la demande de brevet est trop longue par rapport à la commercialisation, les résultats seront publiés afin d'empêcher une demande de brevet par une société dont l'intérêt ne protégerait pas les petites entreprises.</p>
<p>5. Enfin, il sera nécessaire de satisfaire aux exigences des autorités de chaque pays pour obtenir l'approbation du produit. Une exigence spécifique pourrait évidemment mettre en péril la commercialisation du produit car la condition d'obtention de l'agrément modifierait fondamentalement le coût du produit ou la facilité de fabrication.</p>

English Summary
Energy independence implies well dimensioned alternative systems to ensure continued production of electricity and drinking water in of a remote dwelling while reducing its Green House Gas emissions footprint even in prolonged absence of direct solar energy. This breakthrough technology is called to participate in the third industrial revolution: It is born of a convergence of communication technologies and renewable energy. This revolution could open the door to a new post-fossil energy era and where unnecessary and too costly nuclear power, is replaced by a micro-power constellation networked operating somewhat on the model of decentralized Internet.. This eliminates the need for expensive wastewater treatment plants.
This revolutionary technology solves the problem of water scarcity and the energy crisis considering to the expected demographic explosion, provides solutions to reduce the environmental impact of urbanization while offering alternative solutions to reduce water, soil and air pollution.

Module 1 generates steam
Module 2 generates electric power and store it if necessary
Module 3 generates drinking water and store it
Module 4 enables communication between modules and between systems

We are 3 partners in the Bio-S-TEAM company:
Ismael Aduayom: He is the project leader: derived from the knowledge he acquired during his Master’s Degree in Population Biology and Ecosystems from the University Paris VI (including fluid mechanics skills and Astronomy), he studied biotechnology at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, and heavy metal toxicity during his Ph.D (UQAM) and worked  in ecotoxicology (TOXEN, Canada).
Fred Elisma: having both a Masters in Biology and in Bioinformatics (UQAM), he has 10-years’ experience as a software developer. He is in charge of the automation and the website.
Mélanie Grondin: having a Ph.D in Biochemistry (UQAM), she is expert in persistent toxic substances and studied the Tributyltin toxicity. She is in charge of partnerships.


What we need :
The minimum we need is 90 000 € to hire 3 engineers (a mechanical Engineer, a steam process Engineer, an electrical Engineer), and rent an appropriate workshop to build up the final prototype in a sunny area (in Spain).
The Proof of concept has already been established. Since we are collaborating with a Public Laboratory (CNAM - Paris), if the fundraising does not reach its objective, the funds will be used as financial guarantee to raise money at the bank to finance this collaboration.
What you get:
Depending on the amount of your contribution, you may get:
For a contribution of 10 € and more:
A subscription to the quarterly newsletter detailing the progress of the project (and your name mentioned as contributor is you agree).
For a contribution of 300 € and more:

All the above and your coordinates if desired (email address or facebook link) on our website with the indication that you sponsored a local company of your choice*  training to build up the system.
A video of the micro power plant operating at a location.

*  The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum or maximum turnover, a number of employees , its willing to comply with our policy... You may propose a company of your choice but this company should meet our social criteria (social and solidarity economy) and the skills (building construction public works - technical installations). Otherwise, you can pick up one company among the list of companies we will provide to you.
For a contribution of 500 € and more:
All the above and the sponsorship for the internet access to technical specifications for the construction of the system for yourself and a local company of your choice* for one year.
*  The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum or maximum turnover, a number of employees, its willing to comply with our policy... You may propose a company of your choice but this company should meet our social criteria and the skills (building construction public works - technical installations). Otherwise, you can pick up one company among the list of companies we will provide to you.
For a contribution of 1 000 € and more:
All the above and the sponsorship for the construction* of the module 1 (generating steam) at one location** of your choice: it may be your location if you desire (for which you will be kept updated when the technology is ready after certification by local authorities).
* This amount covers only the work force cost and neither the additional material cost nor the automation of the system.
** Any location that do not receive a solar flux above 1 000 W/m2 (usually, outside the tropical area) is unfit and any location where the local regulation prohibit such a construction is unfit. Otherwise, you can choose to sponsorship the people who will benefit from this technology. You may designate us the beneficiary of your choice or choose from a list of potential beneficiaries that we propose. Please note that if you designate a beneficiary of your choice outside the list of potential beneficiaries, you have the obligation to indicate a company that is willing to build the micro powerplant.
For a contribution of 2 000 € and more:
All the above and the additional material cost for the automation of whole the system (module 1 and/or module 2 and /or module 3). Please note that the cost of building modules 2 and / or 3 is not taken into account and remains at your charge.
For a contribution of 5 000 € and more:
All the above and the maintenance contract with the local company* of your choice for 2 years.
Please note that the cost of building modules 2 and / or 3 is not taken into account and remains at your charge.
* The local company must meet several criteria defined in advance such as a minimum or maximum turnover, a number of employees , its willing to comply with our policy...
What you don't get:
Module 2, generating Electric Power and Module 3 generating drinking water. For these 2 modules, you would need to finance it by paying the local installer. However, if you sponsored the training of this local company, you might be in position to ask for a reduction on the prices!
The prices of modules 1, 2, 3 and 4 varies according to :

the cost of local labor
the cost of local material
the cost of local taxes and fees incurred by local regulations

However, the modeling of the price based on an average of the labor cost in Europe, the applied taxes and the administrative costs table on an average price of :
€ 11 500 for module 1 (producing steam)
€ 10 500 for module 2 (producing electric power)
€ 5 500 for module 3 (producing drinking water)
€ 1 200 for module 4 (automation)
Since the construction is local, these theoretical prices may vary according the country where the micro power plant is built. Please note that the cost of installation of photovoltaic panels (which does not produce drinking water) is similar to module 1 & 2 producing electric power for a medium size dwelling.
The Impact:
In a context marked by the increase in world population and the accelerated renewal needs in terms of energy, raw materials, products and services, environmental changes take an enhanced sharpness, from landscape scale to that of the planet (climate, pollution of fresh and marine waters, etc.). There is a strong need to maintain a rational management of resources to adapt to the climate changes in progress.
This project is also social innovations as regards to succeed, thanks to technology. The implementation of the third industrial revolution should help produce and manufacture on site to avoid or reduce environmental impacts, rehabilitate environments, favoring ecological compensation. Sustainable management of natural resources is a major focus of this project to meet the challenges of the energy transition.
The economic innovation must allow accompanying the ecological transition. The need to implement a sustainable competitiveness (with the corresponding jobs and social cohesion Research), wealth-building needs (minimizing resource consumption), environmental requirements (CO2 and water footprints, energy saving, reduction of pollution, elimination of toxic substances, saving natural resources, recycling) are all societal aspects considered in this project to stimulate industrial renewal and promote economic development.
It is expected that in the tropics, solar energy can be efficiently converted into electricity during 4 to 6 hours per day (for days enjoying a continuous sunshine). Thus, the micro power plant would theoretically reduce the use of fossil or nuclear energy from 17 to 25%. Hence and considering that renewables are freely accessible, the use of the micro power plant would simultaneously produce drinking water and electricity allowing a saving on energy bills of emerging countries. The socio-economic impact is all the more important as the product itself is a source of comfort improvement by allowing increasing access to safe drinking water and generates employment for micro power plant maintenance.



Risks ans Challenges
Since the solar concentrating system has already been developed and only the automation of the sun tracking system on its two axes is missing for the submission of the patent application on a solar concentrator. The remaining obstacles concern only 5 points:
1. The modelization of the powers exchanged at the concentrator level and the automatic control of the pressure, the temperature and the flow of liquid water and steam. This is the mission of the CNAM laboratory whose work will help us to establish the automatic control protocols, the choice of sensors and the best strategy to maintain the user's safety when the micro power plant is operating. This may take some time to automate the device, which is why we need an electro-technician.
2. The design of the steam micro turbines is already modeled. However, the differences in properties between the compressed air used to carry out the tests and the steam could vary the expected results, making the final production of the turbine more complex and therefore more expensive (risks associated with erosion by water's droplets). In this case, and rather than persisting in this way, there is already a simple alternative in case of difficulty: the Tesla turbine that is adaptable to the project. The challenge here is to produce a simple design and manufacture a flywheel that is robust and inexpensive and can be combined with a speed reducer with the same qualities. That is why we need a talented mechanical engineer.
3. This engineer should also study the proposed solution to increase the combustion rate of the engine and verify that this solution achieves the desired result. Several scientific publications on this subject have already reported satisfactory results.
4. Finally, the financial risks associated with the strategy for filing patent applications should not be overlooked. These patents are supposed to protect small businesses from the economic power of large firms that can impose market prices and reduce the beneficial effect of competition. If the patent submission is too time-consuming compared to commercialization, the results will be published in order to prevent a patent application by a company whose interest would not protect small companies.
5. Finally, it will be necessary to meet the requirements of the authorities of each country to obtain approval of the product. A specific requirement could of course jeopardize the marketing of the product as the condition for obtaining approval would fundamentally change the cost of the product or the ease of manufacture.

Pour une contribution de 5 000 € et plus:
Tout ce qui précède et le contrat d'entretien avec la société locale * de votre choix pour 2 ans.
Veuillez noter que le coût de construction des modules 2 et / ou 3 n'est pas pris en compte et reste à votre charge.
* La société locale doit répondre à plusieurs critères définis à l'avance comme un chiffre d'affaires minimum ou maximum, un nombre d'employés, sa volonté de se conformer à notre politique ...
Ce que vous n'obtenez pas:
Module 2, générant de l'électricité et module 3 générant de l'eau potable. Pour ces 2 modules, vous devez le financer en payant le programme d'installation local. Cependant, si vous avez parrainé la formation de cette entreprise locale, vous pourriez être en mesure de demander une réduction sur les prix!
Les prix des modules 1, 2, 3 et 4 varient selon:
• le coût de la main d'œuvre locale
• le coût du matériel local
• le coût des taxes locales et des frais encourus par les réglementations locales
Cependant, la modélisation du prix basé sur une moyenne du coût de la main-d'œuvre en Europe, des taxes appliquées et du tableau des frais administratifs sur un prix moyen de:
11 500 € pour le module 1 (production de vapeur)
10 500 € pour le module 2 (production d'énergie électrique)
5 500 € pour le module 3 (production d'eau potable)
1 200 € pour le module 4 (automatisation)
Étant donné que la construction est locale, ces prix théoriques peuvent varier selon le pays où la micro-centrale est construite. Veuillez noter que le coût de l'installation des panneaux photovoltaïques (qui ne produisent pas d'eau potable) est similaire au cout des modules 1 et 2 produisant de l'énergie électrique pour un logement de taille moyenne.
L'impact:
Dans un contexte marqué par l'augmentation de la population mondiale et les besoins de renouvellement accélérés en termes d'énergie, de matières premières, de produits et de services, les changements environnementaux prennent une netteté accrue, de l'échelle du paysage à celle de la planète (climat, Eaux, etc.). Il y a un grand besoin de maintenir une gestion rationnelle des ressources pour s'adapter aux changements climatiques en cours.
Ce projet a aussi des innovations sociales qui profitent de la technologie. La mise en œuvre de la troisième révolution industrielle devrait aider à produire et à fabriquer sur place pour éviter ou réduire les impacts environnementaux, réhabiliter les milieux, favoriser la compensation écologique. La gestion durable des ressources naturelles est un axe majeur de ce projet pour relever les défis de la transition énergétique.
L'innovation économique doit permettre d'accompagner la transition écologique. La nécessité de mettre en place une compétitivité durable (avec les emplois correspondants et la cohésion sociale), les besoins en matière de création de richesse (minimiser la consommation de ressources), les exigences environnementales (CO2 et empreintes d'eau, économies d'énergie, réduction de la pollution, élimination des substances toxiques) Ressources, recyclage) sont tous des aspects sociétaux considérés dans ce projet pour stimuler le renouveau industriel et promouvoir le développement économique.
On s'attend à ce que dans les tropiques, l'énergie solaire puisse être efficacement convertie en électricité pendant 4 à 6 heures par jour (pendant des jours jouissant d'un soleil continu). Ainsi, la micro-centrale réduirait théoriquement l'utilisation de l'énergie fossile ou nucléaire de 17 à 25%. Par conséquent et considérant que les énergies renouvelables sont librement accessibles, l'utilisation de la micro-centrale produirait simultanément de l'eau potable et de l'électricité permettant une économie sur les factures d'énergie des pays émergents. L'impact socio-économique est d'autant plus important que le produit lui-même est une source d'amélioration du confort en permettant un meilleur accès à l'eau potable et génère un emploi pour la maintenance des micro-centrales.
Risques et défis
Etant donné que le système de concentration solaire a déjà été développé et que seule l'automatisation du système de suivi solaire sur ses deux axes manque pour la soumission de la demande de brevet sur un concentrateur solaire. Les autres obstacles ne concernent que 5 points:
1. La modélisation des puissances échangées au niveau du concentrateur et le contrôle automatique de la pression, de la température et du flux d'eau liquide et de vapeur. C'est la mission du laboratoire CNAM qui nous aidera à établir les protocoles de contrôle automatique, le choix des capteurs et la meilleure stratégie pour maintenir la sécurité de l'utilisateur lors de la mise en service de la micro-centrale. Cela peut prendre un certain temps pour automatiser l'appareil, c'est pourquoi nous avons besoin d'un électro-technicien.
2. La conception des microturbines à vapeur est déjà modélisée. Cependant, les différences de propriétés entre l'air comprimé utilisé pour la réalisation des essais et la vapeur peuvent faire varier les résultats escomptés, ce qui rend la production finale de la turbine plus complexe et donc plus onéreuse (risque associé à l'érosion par les gouttelettes). Dans ce cas, et plutôt que de persister de cette voie, il y a déjà une alternative simple en cas de difficulté: la turbine Tesla qui est adaptable au projet. Le défi ici est de produire une conception simple et fabriquer un volant qui est robuste et peu coûteux et peut être combiné avec un réducteur de vitesse avec les mêmes qualités. C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin d'un ingénieur mécanicien talentueux.
3. Cet ingénieur doit également étudier la solution proposée pour augmenter la vitesse de combustion du moteur et vérifier que cette solution atteint le résultat souhaité. Plusieurs publications scientifiques sur ce sujet ont déjà donné des résultats satisfaisants.
4. Enfin, les risques financiers associés à la stratégie de dépôt des demandes de brevet ne doivent pas être négligés. Ces brevets sont censés protéger les petites entreprises du pouvoir économique des grandes entreprises qui peuvent imposer les prix du marché et réduire l'effet bénéfique de la concurrence. Si la demande de brevet est trop longue par rapport à la commercialisation, les résultats seront publiés afin d'empêcher une demande de brevet par une société dont l'intérêt ne protégerait pas les petites entreprises.
5. Enfin, il sera nécessaire de satisfaire aux exigences des autorités de chaque pays pour obtenir l'approbation du produit. Une exigence spécifique pourrait évidemment mettre en péril la commercialisation du produit car la condition d'obtention de l'agrément modifierait fondamentalement le coût du produit ou la facilité de fabrication.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have spent a lot of time over the last year ensuring a viable product offering, lowering manufacturing risks by designing and sampling smaller quantities of units and recently trial shipping by sea (testing import logistics) with our new global transport partner <strong>Shippo</strong>. </p>
<p>In 2017 we grew relationships with the various logistics and manufacturing parties both here in the UK and overseas to bring this idea from concept/prototype to market. At each step we have overcome the obstacles but there are still a few key things on our To-do list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Product Compliance</strong>: as of 05/05/2018 we have achieved European CE product compliance.</li>
<li>
<strong>Product Retail Packaging</strong> and <strong>Final Fulfilment</strong>: We have a sourced a packaging company that is 'on standby' to provide these services. The retail packaging is shaping up and we think you will like our design idea!</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Capacity</strong> will need to be scaled if we get a large IndieGoGo response; we plan to make an initial order for 1000 units and have a phased delivery of Perks/assembled units starting within weeks of receiving the first shipment into the UK. Additional future-delivery dated Perks may be made available. All Perks will be delivered strictly on a first-order first delivered basis.</li>
</ul>
</div><h2> </h2><h2><strong>Use of Funds</strong></h2><p>We are  looking for an initial funding target of $19,500.

</div></div>","AboutPowerPots are exciting new small scale hydroponic (growing in water) systems that let you grow-from-seed many edible plants like herbs, chillies, small tomatoes, etc. They can also be used to grow eye-catching display plants for home, office, restaurants and other retail spaces and with their 'glow in the dark' mood lighting they are sure to get attention:  Save money, grow your own: Fed up with the price of shop bought herbs or buying them in pots only to have them die on you a few weeks later? PowerPots are designed to be simple to use and maximise produce for a given space. PowerPots come complete with two replaceable seed trays allowing you to enjoy 12-18 months of growing, produce will always be fresh on demand and save you money over shop bought.-One supplied seed tray is for growing herbs and smaller plants;   The 2nd seed tray for larger single plants like chillies, tomatoes and pumpkins (yes we have a pumpkin growing in ours, also see our Facebook link below for many more photos);  Their minimalist art-deco inspired design 'brings a little bling to growing' while avoiding the mess of growing in soil. The clear root viewport allows you to see your plants roots growing down into the nutrient rich water and check the plants health like never before. It's an amazing unseen world hidden beneath the soil until now.  And due to the incredible capacity of the PowerPot to 'grow big' you do not have to transplant your seedlings once they have got going: this is a ‘seed-to-fruit’ all in one device not just a simple propagator so no messy re-potting required. Hydroponics: key advantages over soil based growing:  
Very efficient -roots have 100% access to nutrients
A lot less water usage -around 1/10th of soil based
Plants typically grow twice as fast
Vitamin content can be up to 50% higher
Effective, targetted use of nutrients and feeds
Easy to harvest -using the 'cut and come again' technique herbs keep on delivering!
Less mess than soil -a lot less, no more blackened fingernails!
PowerPots measure a neat 14cm  (/5.5"") cubed and holds around 1.5 Litres (/2.5 Pints) of nutrient solution when full (a simple mix of tap water and liquid plant feed). This size hydroponic system is roughly equivalent to a plant pot ten times as big filled with soil, it's a modern day grow bag in a tiny pot that can sit on your windowsill and produce masses of produce and we are including 2 seed trays that will give you 12-18 months of growing your own delicious, tasty herbs and other plants in it.""I've been trialling an early prototype PowerPot for about 12 months now to grow  my first ever plants: chillies and the results are amazing. I've had to cut the thing back several times as it was just getting too big and have had several bumper crops already with a third on the way. I've used them in my cooking and they taste great!"" -ShaunW.(model shown is an early pre-FaceRing type with test multi-seed tray) ____________________________________________________________ Key PowerPot Features  Key Feature Details:
Strong 4mm thick acrylic case manufactured by an aquarium producer.
Long life whisper quiet brushless motor. Note: Air pump motors used in some 'bubble' systems tend to be brushed variety which have a much shorter lifespan.
An inbuilt multi-colour LED light allows the PowerPot to become a bit of a chameleon and blend in with its environment, or simply change the colour to suite your mood, roots also look great when highlighted and water flow can be mesmerising to watch. 
Customisable ‘Facerings’* in a choice of colours -good looks as standard.
Safety feature: low voltage powered (""USB""=5v) -we took a decision early on to keep dangerous mains voltages as far away from a watery product as possible…
Safety feature -work in progress: Magnetic coupler for USB power cable. No fear of pulling the unit off your windowsill as the magnetic power coupler will simply pop-off if the cable is tugged accidentally.
 *The PowerPot design has interchangeable snap-on coloured ""Facerings"" that allows you to customise the look and feel of your pot even when the internal light is off, these attach to the round crystal clear viewport that lets you view your roots:  We are going to be making the 3D printer .stl files for all the parts available so you will be able to print your own and have some 'specials' available like this Halloween Facering with more to come...;

Why the PowerPot?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-63xKNnW0A

 Note: Due to its small size it is not suitable to use as an aquarium/aquaponic setup, although we have some small aquatic snails in an experimental unit that seem quite happy...  Some more ideas of how you could customise your growing experience with our free downloads;Level indicator: Add-on side panels: ____________________________________________________________ Prototypes and Design EvolutionThe design has come quite a way since the earliest concept sketch which only included a simple slit to indicate water level. There was no inbuilt lighting at this stage but early on we took the decision to make the unit USB powered; We bought a vacuum forming machine to experiment on the critical seed tray design in 2015. A big ""breakthrough"" was the purchase of a 3D printer in 2016 which turbo-charged the iterative design/development process by allowing us to print our own product parts and also 3D molds for the vacuum former. Our 3D printed parts include the pump/filter unit, feet, spout and currently the Facerings (we will move to injection moulding for this part for added quality and speed of delivery.)We will be providing these 3D printer component files if you want spares or design your own. We have made a pumpkin-face design for Halloween! (See photo section.)3D printed / manufactured parts, we have our own production line going now;  Click on the PowerPot image below to take a closer look in 3D:  VictoryGrow 'baselined' the PowerPot design in 2017 and expanded our relationship with key partners to bring this design to market, here is the very first Production Line run of seed trays:   We are now ready to share this idea with The World! Watch ""The Drawn World"": an animated video of one of the earlier prototype units in action: https://www.facebook.com/hydroplanter/videos/83... ____________________________________________________________ Perks

Nick and Basil: VictoryGrow Founder and lover of fresh Basil on my pizzas... Finding solutions to problems is my middle name, with a BSc in IT and over 20 years experience helping to take over the World with mobile technologies it's time to focus on growing real living stuff with bling using the minimum of fuss, space and mess. This Campaign gets the ball rolling on the new unique PowerPot. Please come along on this journey and let's make a great solution together! 
Sami the Plant Doctor: With a 'PhD in Plants' Sami is well placed to act as Scientific Adviser and helps to keep me designing in the right direction also coming up with some great ideas along the way. ""Lollipop seedsticks"" -you need a big brain to come up with something like that! 
Mr. ""DoItAll"" aka Shaun: With an inherent capacity to get stuff organised and done beyond that of mere mortals Shaun is looking after the overall plan and its execution. He has an Electronics Degree, MA and even a keen stone sculptor and lover of concrete in his spare time as well as always having three phones on hand! 
Anne: the long suffering partner and star of the promotional video (check out those nails!) Anne has 'put up' with my increasingly serious hobby over the years and now helps with Finance and Marketing parts. As well as having a Maths Degree from Oxford she is a pivot-table wizard when required and has recently discovered that growing plants in soil gets her lovely fingernails messed up which she hates. PowerPots will solve that problem hands down...! -Together we are ""The Four Amigos"" !  
The Impact
It's time for change, ultimately we would like the PowerPot to be just the start of a home growing revolution getting us back to an appreciation of what exactly goes into the food we eat. Tasty home cooked meals full of goodness and nutrition from freshly cut herbs, chillies and tomatoes is a small step down that road...
VictoryGrow is committed to providing unique, sustainable and chic home growing solutions. Our motto is 'growing by design' and our products will always be designed to be the most chic, most energy, water and nutrient efficient way to grow stuff available.
 


 
Risks & Challenges
We have spent a lot of time over the last year ensuring a viable product offering, lowering manufacturing risks by designing and sampling smaller quantities of units and recently trial shipping by sea (testing import logistics) with our new global transport partner Shippo. 
In 2017 we grew relationships with the various logistics and manufacturing parties both here in the UK and overseas to bring this idea from concept/prototype to market. At each step we have overcome the obstacles but there are still a few key things on our To-do list:


Product Compliance: as of 05/05/2018 we have achieved European CE product compliance.

Product Retail Packaging and Final Fulfilment: We have a sourced a packaging company that is 'on standby' to provide these services. The retail packaging is shaping up and we think you will like our design idea!

Production Capacity will need to be scaled if we get a large IndieGoGo response; we plan to make an initial order for 1000 units and have a phased delivery of Perks/assembled units starting within weeks of receiving the first shipment into the UK. Additional future-delivery dated Perks may be made available. All Perks will be delivered strictly on a first-order first delivered basis.

 Use of FundsWe are  looking for an initial funding target of $19,500. The sum sought is relatively low so the chances of it being met are high in order to get this product out to as many people as possible and build a community of PowerPot users. When the funding goal is met all Perk-derived funding will go into the 1000 unit-order pot, VictoryGrow will make up any shortfall guaranteeing your Perk.  TimelineAt this point we expect EarlyBird/Early Delivery units to commence delivery mid-June 2018 with the main bulk of remaining deliveries arriving in UK for final assembly before being dispatched to you from August onwards. Shipping by sea to UK of a bulk order is a good way to keep overall prices down and we have already a done a trial of this earlier this year. Stretch GoalsAdditional items will be made available when we hit the following funding goals:
$25,000+: Upgrade August-delivery PowerPot Perks to Mag Connect for free.
$50,000+: We will include an extra FaceRing in each Perk.
$100,000+: We will start development of the ""WinterLite GrowLED"" and include a 50% discount in each Perk, should then be ready for Winter 2018/19.

Every little helps and even though you may not want to own a PowerPot we appreciate any support you can give us and have come up with a special Foundation Help Perk that gets you an electronic copy of a unique piece of artwork by Tokyo-based designer Amershin Reinhart.

<strong>H20 and GO- </strong><strong>A Solar Powered, Portable, Running Water Source</strong>
</h2>
<p>Join this amazing initiative and take part in something bigger than yourself. We can turn dirty, unsanitary, disease-filled water into 99.9% pure clean drinking water. We can filter it into our mobile tank, easily move it anywhere, and with H2O and Go's fitted attachments, users can fill water bottles, wash hands, take a shower, or even water gardens.</p>
<p>The onboard battery which supplies power to the pump is recharged by a built-in solar panel using renewable energy, making it ideal for remote locations. No electricity is required to pump water from H2O and Go making it the only complete water filtering and delivery system of its kind. The large pneumatic tires make it easy to pull by hand or with an ATV over any terrain or debris. The light filtering, opaque, 25-gallon tank enables safe storage of standing water. We've even added charging ports for emergency charging of devices. The engineering is done, the patent is filed, and our first, crude prototype has been working for the last 4 years. We need your help to add the features that will help us save lives!</p>
<p>The affordable base unit is perfect for anywhere that tap water is available and can be used. It is ideal for watering plants, gardens, and vegetation, car dealerships/car washing, outdoor furniture/accessory cleaning, camping, hunting, fishing, sports teams, and venues.</p>
<p>The available attachments, perfect for anywhere that electricity and clean water are NOT available, are:</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Team</h2>
<p>Our team came together because of a shared goal and a shared dedication to turn that goal into a reality. I'm an electrician by trade and my wife is a teaching assistant. We've been board members, business owners, and landlords. Our team is made up of mostly college and graduate students; our children and past employees who all share a social conscience and the brightest minds. We’ve committed everything we have to this campaign - time, resources, and above all, ceaseless passion.</p>
<p>I made the first prototype myself, with a few purchased items and scraps from the garage. It served it's purpose (and still does) and made watering the plants at our business quicker, easier, and more efficient. When the idea came to me, that if I could deliver running water on my 5 acres, then I could deliver it to areas that have no access to running water or areas struck by natural disaster. My wife and I hired an engineering firm to basically take the ideas from my brain and design H2O and Go. They did an amazing job and now that our patent is filed, we're ready to water the world!</p>
<p>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536776723/jypo4g8izdddwp47ty24.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We Need You and We Need Your Help!</strong></p>
<p>In order to reach our goal, which will fund the features necessary to bring our prototype to the next level, we need to raise $33,000.00. The engineer who designed the H2O and Go is waiting in the wings for the okay from us to start production!</p>
<p>In addition to knowing what a difference you are making and that you are helping to potentially save lives, we've come up with perks to thank you for your help and support.</p>
<p>Knowing that you've helped to water the world may be rewarding enough for you, but to thank you for your help and support we have H20 and Go stickers, wristbands, water bottles, and T-shirts, so you can proudly display your involvement in our worthy cause. </p>
<h3>Nothing Will Stop Us!</h3>
<p>Our passion, dedication, and devotion to providing access to clean water won't stop if we don't reach our goal.  We will continue our fundraising efforts until we can deliver H2O and Go and water the world! If we exceed our goal, we can begin manufacturing even sooner and start watering the world!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h2>
<p><strong>You can make a difference!</strong> By joining our campaign, you can help us bring our product anywhere, to anyone who needs access to clean water. The implications are huge! You can help stop the spread of disease and help save lives! Your contribution will help make our dream a reality and help countless people.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Master Plan and Commitment</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal is to be able to donate H2O and Go to disaster relief efforts and communities in need of clean water. Our master plan is to sell H2O and Go to individuals, business, municipalities, sports teams, and venues so we can afford to meet our goal.  Our commitment and long-term goal is to have H2O and Go available worldwide to provide clean water, improve hygiene, and stop the spread of disease.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Ways To Help</h2>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute to our campaign, but believe in H2O and Go and want to help us water the world, then help us spread the word!  With one click, you can share our campaign using Indiegogo's sharing tools. Thank you for your support! Together we can water the world!</p>

The onboard battery which supplies power to the pump is recharged by a built-in solar panel using renewable energy, making it ideal for remote locations. No electricity is required to pump water from H2O and Go making it the only complete water filtering and delivery system of its kind. The large pneumatic tires make it easy to pull by hand or with an ATV over any terrain or debris. The light filtering, opaque, 25-gallon tank enables safe storage of standing water. We've even added charging ports for emergency charging of devices. The engineering is done, the patent is filed, and our first, crude prototype has been working for the last 4 years. We need your help to add the features that will help us save lives!
The affordable base unit is perfect for anywhere that tap water is available and can be used. It is ideal for watering plants, gardens, and vegetation, car dealerships/car washing, outdoor furniture/accessory cleaning, camping, hunting, fishing, sports teams, and venues.
The available attachments, perfect for anywhere that electricity and clean water are NOT available, are:

 Water Filter-to filter dirty, creek, pond, or flood waters into pure clean drinking water.                                      

Water Fountain/Bottle Filler-to enable drinking clean water where access to electricity or drinkable, clean water is not available.                                                                                                                                  

Sink Attachment-for hands, dishes, and utensil washing.                                                                                                
Shower Attachment- to enable personal hygiene and showering in any remote area where water and electricity are not available.                                                                                                                                       
Sudsing Wand-for cleaning cars, outdoor furniture, and accessories in any location where water and/or electricity are not readily available.      

                          
  6. Charging ports-for emergency charging of devices, to enable communication, when electricity is not available.                                                                 
                                                  
Our Team
Our team came together because of a shared goal and a shared dedication to turn that goal into a reality. I'm an electrician by trade and my wife is a teaching assistant. We've been board members, business owners, and landlords. Our team is made up of mostly college and graduate students; our children and past employees who all share a social conscience and the brightest minds. We’ve committed everything we have to this campaign - time, resources, and above all, ceaseless passion.
I made the first prototype myself, with a few purchased items and scraps from the garage. It served it's purpose (and still does) and made watering the plants at our business quicker, easier, and more efficient. When the idea came to me, that if I could deliver running water on my 5 acres, then I could deliver it to areas that have no access to running water or areas struck by natural disaster. My wife and I hired an engineering firm to basically take the ideas from my brain and design H2O and Go. They did an amazing job and now that our patent is filed, we're ready to water the world!
                                   
What We Need!
We Need You and We Need Your Help!
In order to reach our goal, which will fund the features necessary to bring our prototype to the next level, we need to raise $33,000.00. The engineer who designed the H2O and Go is waiting in the wings for the okay from us to start production!
In addition to knowing what a difference you are making and that you are helping to potentially save lives, we've come up with perks to thank you for your help and support.
Knowing that you've helped to water the world may be rewarding enough for you, but to thank you for your help and support we have H20 and Go stickers, wristbands, water bottles, and T-shirts, so you can proudly display your involvement in our worthy cause. 
Nothing Will Stop Us!
Our passion, dedication, and devotion to providing access to clean water won't stop if we don't reach our goal.  We will continue our fundraising efforts until we can deliver H2O and Go and water the world! If we exceed our goal, we can begin manufacturing even sooner and start watering the world!
The Impact
You can make a difference! By joining our campaign, you can help us bring our product anywhere, to anyone who needs access to clean water. The implications are huge! You can help stop the spread of disease and help save lives! Your contribution will help make our dream a reality and help countless people.
                                                     
 
Our Master Plan and Commitment
Our goal is to be able to donate H2O and Go to disaster relief efforts and communities in need of clean water. Our master plan is to sell H2O and Go to individuals, business, municipalities, sports teams, and venues so we can afford to meet our goal.  Our commitment and long-term goal is to have H2O and Go available worldwide to provide clean water, improve hygiene, and stop the spread of disease.

That is why we created the Dazz 3D LCD 3D printer, a professional grade printer with 2K LCD panel & dual-liner slides which enable more detailed, dimensionally accurate and structurally robust models, yet is affordable to everyone.We created Dazz 3D with consumers in mind; it includes special features such as an air-purification system, automatic resin refill, deluxe 7'' Touchscreen control, and wireless connection that make 3D printing easier and healthier!The Advanced 3D Printer

 Dazz 3D is equipped with a 2K HD LCD screen coupled with a Purple 405nm LED lamp to project slices of a 3D model onto the floor of resin container. This method allows Dazz 3D to make more detailed, dimensionally accurate and structurally robust models.  High Precision
 10μm Z & 47μm XY resolutionThe Layer resolution capability is up to 25 microns, XY Resolution is 47μm,  and Z resolution is 10μm.   2K Resolution
 Fast printer speedHigh precision, yet not comprising on printing speed. The light rate 3.8 times faster than normal light-cured resin 3D printer. The printing speed is up to 36mm/hr. 36mm/hr
 Dual Z-Axis SlidesThe unique dual-liner slides are designed to eliminate wobbling, and create highly precise 3D models with an ultra-smooth surface.  Dual Z-Axis Slides
 Dual Slides vs Single Slide
  
 Safe PrintingThe Air-purification system includes a low-speed fan and an activated carbon filter to remove ultra-fine particles and unpleasant fumes for a healthier printing environment.    Air Purification System
 Auto Resin SystemYou simply need to put 1 bottle of resin upside down into Dazz 3D and that’s all! The resin refills automatically as needed when printing large models.  Auto Resin System
 Intuitive ControlWith the deluxe 7'' touchscreen monitor on the body, users change print settings & track printing status anytime with just a simple touch control.   7"" Touchscreen
  Auto Resin WiperThe pro version includes an effective resin wiper to remove particulates and improve print consistency and quality by mixing the solid powder evenly when ceramic resin, powder, or other creative materials are added. While, when printing with Dazz 3D resins, there is no need to open the auto resin wiper due to the extension of printing time and quality it may caused.  Auto Resin Wiper
 
 Getting started with Dazz 3D is super easy. It supports WiFi, cable, or USB driver connection. We offer free slicer software downloading on our website. Simple import the printing files and connected to Dazz 3D, you are all set. Easy to Use
 Efficient Tank Cleansing There are two buckles at both sides, and you simply open the buckles and take the tank out  for cleansing and saving the remaining resin! For tank cleansing, 75% alcohol is preferred!  Efficient Tank Cleansing

<li>My name is Travis Flatt and I am the founder of Upward Harvest. With just over 20 years of experience, my agricultural background didn't begin until the age of 14. I didn't grow up on a farm nor was I raised in blue jeans and boots, but I have always enjoyed hard work and innovation. Being raised in a low income home, innovation for us was a part of every day life.  If we couldn't afford it, we did our best to create our own. And living without on many occasions, I fully understand how a shortage of healthy food options has become too common in our society.  </li>
<li>Our goal in this campaign is to scale our patented growing technologies into an impactful urban farming concept that can be replicated across communities all over the world. We believe healthy, affordable food can change lives. In order to feed people no one else is feeding, we have to grow in ways no one else is growing.</li>
<li>Your contribution will multiply the impact we are already making here in central Oklahoma. With your help we can begin to create partnerships with other entrepreneurs to launch urban farms in your very own community.</li>
</ul><h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>Our goal is to raise $250,000. With this money we will increase our chicken flock from 700 to 2000. Our hens will also be moved out onto pasture land where they will enjoy a more natural growing environment with the benefit of accessing fresh pasture every day of their lives. In addition to scaling our egg business, we will also be refining our patented growing structures and tray technologies to account for large scale production and rapid deployment of our urban farming concept.

</li>
<li>To this point, we are feeding only a small percentage of the population of central Oklahoma.

<li>This is the section where they want us to talk about the risks of this endeavor. While no one is fully immune from the effect of natural disasters, we chose a great place to start. In Oklahoma, we regularly face extreme heat, blistering cold, ice and snow storms, tornados, droughts, large hail, flooding and even earthquakes, but none of those has stopped us yet. Facing the challenges of our state's climate has prepared us to grow almost anywhere.</li>
<li>Besides the above, we also face real pressure from big agribusiness and by extension, the legislation they influence in order to dictate and preserve the methods agriculture has operated under for the last 70 plus years.

<p><strong>Do you know that gold coins and jewellery have mark-ups from 20-100% and sometimes, its not even solid gold?</strong></p>
<p>It's a no-brainer that gold is one of the most versatile and sought after materials on the planet. Throughout history, societies have been fascinated with its magical properties, and today when it comes to wealth preservation, it still remains the “go-to” resource.</p>
<p>Today you can buy refined .999 Gold and invest in our environment at the same time!</p>
<p>Spot of Gold is made from pure recovered gold and its value changes just like the market prices.  We have not spent heavily on making these golden discs so its value remains true to the actual price of gold. A timeless and long term investment, a Spot of Gold can be stashed, worn or sold easily to any buyer for its pure 24 karat gold value should you need the cash.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know that most electronic scrap contains some amount of Gold? </strong></p>
<p>Gold is one of the best conductors of electricity and because it is the most malleable metal, it can be made into micro-thin coatings and is highly resistant to tarnish. These characteristics made it highly suitable for connectors, circuit boards, and components like pins found in computers, phones, and other electronic gadgets. In fact, 40% of all new gold production is used for electronics applications. That is $485 Million per year!</p>
<p>Paradoxically, discarded electronics are driving the fastest growing problem in landfills. Who could imagine? Only 20% of the e-waste generated worldwide is being properly recycled. We are throwing the precious metals used to create phones and computers into the garbage. In the very real sense we are throwing gold away.</p>
<p><strong>We found the Sweet Spot - Get Bullion for Boards</strong></p>
<p>At the end of 2018, we began collecting, separating and processing circuit boards and other e-waste for refining. Our mission is to keep phones, computers and other electronic devices out of our landfills. To be more environmentally friendly, we recycle these items called eWaste, to recover gold and other precious metals. We created the 'Spot of Gold' or 'SPOG' as an alternate form of payment for those that want to help us dig in further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS A “SPOT OF GOLD” ?</strong></p>

<p>A '<strong>Spot of Gold</strong>' (SPOG), delivered in a standardized fractional gold portion, weighs one-tenth of an ounce. It is beautifully rendered by the award-winning jewellery designer, Justin Bortz of Midnight Swan Designs. 'Spogs' are real gold formed into small affordable discs. These golden discs are crafted from eco-gold that have been safely recovered from the refining of eWaste. If you’re looking for ways to diversify your investment portfolio, our 'Spot of Gold' is a surefire way of doing just that; and your purchase helps us buy more eWaste.</p>
<p>The Spot of Gold is also a good alternative for those looking to collect pure gold in a smaller affordable way.  We drilled a small hole so you can wear your asset and keep it close at hand.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OUR NEEDS</strong></p>
<p>As with all new ideas, we’ve come to realize how big and terrific of an idea this really is and we’ve concluded that we’ll need your support to move this to a nationwide initiative:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need funds to pay the landfill owners and get the eWaste back to our warehouse</li>
<li>Help us with shipping costs from all states, near and far, from small collectors</li>
<li>Source more equipment for testing and assessing gold content</li>
<li>We will hire more people to inspect and sort the eWaste into 3 refining categories: plated (pins), plastic (boards/fingers) and ceramic (CPU chips)</li>
<li>Buy a mold for mass production of the Spot of Gold and we can make them by hand too</li>
<li>Printing a certificate acknowledging a purchase and in which Series of production</li>
<li>Each series will consist of 1500 SPOGs starting with our Series A and B</li>
<li>As a Series sells out then we are happy to add the next Series</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Having done our homework well and thoroughly eliminating all the non-essentials we’ve come to the conclusion that the sum of $25,000 (that's a 150 SPOGs) will be needed to lift this idea to the next stage. So, we’re offering you the opportunity to join and rock the boat with us as together we make this a reality.  We think you should be rewarded for your contributions and offer you Gold for garbage!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Average home in 2015, in America generated 262.4 million tons of waste, which is about 4.5% increase from 2010 and a whopping 60% from 1985. That amounts to at least five (5) pounds per person a day! This, of course, isn’t without a cost. As a matter of fact, the cost is twofold: Environmental and Financial.</p>
<p>Tackling the environmental effects first, consider landfills are the third-largest source of methane emissions in the country; when organic waste sits in a landfill, it decomposes and emits methane. Granted, burning plastic may create some energy, but it also produces carbon emissions. What is more, studies have found that incineration facilities release those harmful chemicals in plastics, such as mercury and lead, into the air.</p>
<p>Alternately, it’s becoming expensive to ship waste hundreds of miles to landfills. Some dumps are even raising costs to deal with all this extra waste; according to one estimate, along the West Coast, landfill fees increased by $8 a ton from 2017 to 2018. Buying a ‘Spot of Gold’ helps us clean up a small part of our planet and the landfills continually.</p>
<p>Economically speaking, gold is a limited resource and recovering precious metal from phones is far more efficient and profitable than mining it. Safe refining processes can recover between .6 and 1.8 grams of pure gold from just ten pounds of smart phones.</p>

<p>We are all concerned and want to help our environment reach a better state. To this end, once again we’re letting you know it is difficult to do it all alone, so we ask you to kindly support us and help make this project a reality.</p>
<p>And as a reward for your kind support, we’ve carefully designed a few perk levels and some appreciation rewards to show our gratitude. Please choose any one, as you can make your pledge to help others with shipping costs or support the production of your very own 'Spog'. You can personalize your Spot of Gold and wear it on a chain to help further our cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</strong></p>
<p>We will happily accept contributions that will be directed to helping our Scrapping Warriors by helping pay their shipping costs for loads of eWaste under 150lbs.  It's the smaller loads that are at the most risk of being tossed because it's hard to justify the shipping costs for some items.</p>
<p>Sometimes, some things are beyond our control. Don’t worry we understand. So if money is totally out of the picture, no worries as you can still pledge your support and be part of our community by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving us constructive suggestions</li>
<li>Sharing this on your social media page (<i>awareness of our project is as important as every penny</i> spent)</li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We've always kept an eye toward changing things and making them better. Not being able to fit so many differently-sized dishes into a standard dishwasher rack, and having to wash many of them by hand (hence significantly increasing water wastage), has made us understand that a better solution was required.</p>
<p>How significant could it be to our environment?</p>

We've always kept an eye toward changing things and making them better. Not being able to fit so many differently-sized dishes into a standard dishwasher rack, and having to wash many of them by hand (hence significantly increasing water wastage), has made us understand that a better solution was required.

<p> ""A lifestyle lamp for home or office I envisioned being created  with futuristic applications that are safe, natural, easy to use and sure to create harmony, love, a balanced lifestyle.""  Carol Calvert, creator, explains. ""Manufacturing and I begin our design with a raw, untreated maple wood six inch circular drum for stability, beauty and balance.  By creating the Living Wellology without finishes to the wood, we leave it open to breathe what is has to come forth from within.  The raw, maple drum base and the six inch crystal circular top are both engraved with the sacred geometry, the flower of life, known for it's physics connection of all of creation with the golden mean formula (from a sea shell, plant kingdom, human and animal body parts design, we see the workings of the flower of life.) ""</p>
<p> ""Next, we engineered the Living Wellology to house simply two operating controls beyond the on/off switch.  One for a light color choice for your lamp; the other for a lifestyle setting choice.""  RS LED Light choices (tv controls or that of a stoplight)  include red, green, blue and full spectrum white (called in the LED Blub industry as Daylight, or all the colors of the sun at 12pm).  It is long established in science that light affects us positively as living beings, be it human, animal or plant.  Lifestyle Choices are derived from how we interact with everything we come in contact in life with from food, water, what we ingest, smell, hear, touch, who we choose to spend time with, work with, workout with, vacation and study with.  This list goes on in a global society, from how we travel: be it in our cars, by train, by air, internet, cell phone, and many other mobile applications.  We are energy and light beings interacting with energy and light, or lack of and our experiences attest to what we are feeling and being.  Even in ancient times, it was established that frequency impacts our lives in a good, bad or in between way. </p>

<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Thursday was the darkest day of the year both literally and, for many, mentally.</p>
<p>It was the 2017 winter solstice, which is known to trigger or worsen seasonal depression in millions of Americans.</p>
<p>“People experience a sense of sadness that's overwhelming,” one doctor explained. “It's not just, 'I wish the winter would go away I can't wait for spring,' sometimes it's so impactful that people can't get out of bed.”</p>
<p>“It could lead to suicidal thoughts during these kinds of episodes which is why you do not want to ignore this type of depression.”</p>
<p>It's called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a type of depression that usually comes on during the winter and vanishes by spring.</p>
<p>You might know it as the ""winter blues."" Experts say it has to do with the reduction of sunlight.</p>
<p>Now, medical research suggests tricking our bodies could be the solution.</p>
<p>“A lot of people don't even know that they can make changes in the way they feel with light,"" said Carol Calvert, a light therapy expert based in Charlotte.</p>
<p>“You want to be in light more than not,"" she said.</p>
<p>You can buy light therapy lamps online, Calvert even invented her own. The idea is that the bulbs make your body think you're standing out in the sunshine.</p>
<p>And you don't need to drop a fortune. You can pick up the so-called ""daylight"" bulbs for a few dollars.</p>
<p>“Big box stores will not tell you that this is a wellness bulb but it is,” Calvert said. “This bulb will change the way you feel about life, period.”</p>
<p>She suggests installing daylight bulbs around your house and making it a point to go outside.</p>

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Thursday was the darkest day of the year both literally and, for many, mentally.
It was the 2017 winter solstice, which is known to trigger or worsen seasonal depression in millions of Americans.
“People experience a sense of sadness that's overwhelming,” one doctor explained. “It's not just, 'I wish the winter would go away I can't wait for spring,' sometimes it's so impactful that people can't get out of bed.”
“It could lead to suicidal thoughts during these kinds of episodes which is why you do not want to ignore this type of depression.”
It's called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, a type of depression that usually comes on during the winter and vanishes by spring.
You might know it as the ""winter blues."" Experts say it has to do with the reduction of sunlight.
Now, medical research suggests tricking our bodies could be the solution.
“A lot of people don't even know that they can make changes in the way they feel with light,"" said Carol Calvert, a light therapy expert based in Charlotte.
“You want to be in light more than not,"" she said.
You can buy light therapy lamps online, Calvert even invented her own. The idea is that the bulbs make your body think you're standing out in the sunshine.
And you don't need to drop a fortune. You can pick up the so-called ""daylight"" bulbs for a few dollars.
“Big box stores will not tell you that this is a wellness bulb but it is,” Calvert said. “This bulb will change the way you feel about life, period.”
She suggests installing daylight bulbs around your house and making it a point to go outside.
“Everyone, get out and spend time in the sun,” she said.

<h3>Check out our newest perk - your own mini solar generator/charger for $55 AUD (around $40 USD) with free postage to the US, Canada and Australia!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of passionate entrepreneurs located in Brisbane, Australia who believe in reducing CO2 emissions through providing renewable energy to the world. </p>
<p><strong>We are determined to construct a fully portable generator using 100% renewable energy that produces power equal to, or in excess of, a 34kw standard diesel generator. </strong></p>
<p>There is a huge and unaddressed global demand for portable generators. Almost all sizeable energy generators that can be transported by road or rail (e.g. for concerts and festivals, rural and remote communities, developing communities, caravan parks, outdoor markets and following natural disasters) are diesel or petrol-based, with ongoing costs for fuel. They also produce significant amounts of pollution. </p>
<p>We wanted to produce a renewable alternative that creates the same amount of electricity with supply available at any time, day or night.</p>
<p>Frankly, anyone can transport solar PV panels to a location and capture electricity. The challenge is to convert and store it effectively, particularly if you plan to move the unit to a range of different locations and have it work with minimal customisation. This requires sophisticated hardware and software that can respond to a wide range of conditions, as well as high-quality batteries and PV panels. </p>
<p><strong>We think we have the solution. </strong></p>
<p>In early 2018 a proof-of-concept design was tested in the EU demonstrating <u>it was possible to generate comparable power as a diesel generator.</u></p>
<p>High quality photovoltaic panels, a high-capacity battery, tailored hardware to tackle conversion and storage and carefully written software to ensure an efficient and consistent flow of electricity was used.</p>
<p>Importantly, this system will fit into a weatherproof container that can be transported on standard-gauge road and rail.</p>
<p>It will also be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Portable </strong>- installed almost anywhere there is sunlight in 90 minutes</li>
<li>
<strong>100% renewable</strong> - using high-quality German solar cells and batteries</li>
<li>
<strong>Continuous </strong>- 24 hour power via a battery and software</li>
<li>
<strong>Powerful</strong> - the unit will be able to power up to 10 standard US houses simultaneously for up to 15 years</li>
<li>
<strong>Cost-effective</strong> - cost of power is expected to be cheaper than a diesel generator over the life of the unit (at least 15 years), and the break-even cost with a diesel generator, including fuel, is 3.5 years. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our product will address a clear gap in the global renewable energy market through the provision of portable solar production and storage.</p>
<p><strong>It will help remote and vulnerable communities around the world and will help save the planet. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Will Get</h3>
<p>In early 2018, a unit was successfully tested in the EU demonstrating proof of concept. We need your support to get things moving and achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembly of software and  hardware into a portable container; </li>
<li>Testing, conversion and certification in key markets (beginning with Australia and following with New Zealand, the US, the Pacific Islands, the Philippines and Indonesia, where demand is significant and sunshine is abundant); </li>

Summary
We are a group of passionate entrepreneurs located in Brisbane, Australia who believe in reducing CO2 emissions through providing renewable energy to the world. 
We are determined to construct a fully portable generator using 100% renewable energy that produces power equal to, or in excess of, a 34kw standard diesel generator. 
There is a huge and unaddressed global demand for portable generators. Almost all sizeable energy generators that can be transported by road or rail (e.g. for concerts and festivals, rural and remote communities, developing communities, caravan parks, outdoor markets and following natural disasters) are diesel or petrol-based, with ongoing costs for fuel. They also produce significant amounts of pollution. 
We wanted to produce a renewable alternative that creates the same amount of electricity with supply available at any time, day or night.
Frankly, anyone can transport solar PV panels to a location and capture electricity. The challenge is to convert and store it effectively, particularly if you plan to move the unit to a range of different locations and have it work with minimal customisation. This requires sophisticated hardware and software that can respond to a wide range of conditions, as well as high-quality batteries and PV panels. 
We think we have the solution. 
In early 2018 a proof-of-concept design was tested in the EU demonstrating it was possible to generate comparable power as a diesel generator.
High quality photovoltaic panels, a high-capacity battery, tailored hardware to tackle conversion and storage and carefully written software to ensure an efficient and consistent flow of electricity was used.
Importantly, this system will fit into a weatherproof container that can be transported on standard-gauge road and rail.
It will also be:


Portable - installed almost anywhere there is sunlight in 90 minutes

100% renewable - using high-quality German solar cells and batteries

Continuous - 24 hour power via a battery and software

Powerful - the unit will be able to power up to 10 standard US houses simultaneously for up to 15 years

Cost-effective - cost of power is expected to be cheaper than a diesel generator over the life of the unit (at least 15 years), and the break-even cost with a diesel generator, including fuel, is 3.5 years. 

Our product will address a clear gap in the global renewable energy market through the provision of portable solar production and storage.
It will help remote and vulnerable communities around the world and will help save the planet. 

What We Need & What You Will Get
In early 2018, a unit was successfully tested in the EU demonstrating proof of concept. We need your support to get things moving and achieve the following:

Assembly of software and  hardware into a portable container; 
Testing, conversion and certification in key markets (beginning with Australia and following with New Zealand, the US, the Pacific Islands, the Philippines and Indonesia, where demand is significant and sunshine is abundant); 
Marketing and promotional material to make people aware of the product

We estimate the assembly, testing, shipping of EU parts, conversion and certification will take around 9 months. 
Because the first unit will be converted to Australian standards, this will ensure high safety standards and rigorous compliance that will apply to most other markets. Once this has begun, we will expand to other markets, with an emphasis on developing economies who can benefit the most from our unit (the FAQ provides more information). 
You will also get some fantastic perks - some of the best in crowdfunding - from donating as little as $10 AUD.
Your Impact

Our vision is to be a provider of portable, renewable energy solutions globally. 
We are absolutely committed to halting global warming through the reduction of CO2 emissions and believe this will be the key challenge for humanity in this century. 
We also believe that by providing portable power anywhere in the world, the worlds poorest communities will be able to access power without having to purchase increasingly expensive fossil fuels.
Once the unit is purchased and provided (e.g. for a remote village) there are virtually no additional costs, as the fuel source (the sun) is free. 
This provides an amazing opportunity to combat global warming and global poverty at the same time. 
Put simply, we aim to make energy green, accessible and affordable. 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially, we understand. But please help us to get the word out through posting this to Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms, so we can roll out these generators to vulnerable communities around the world and combat global warming at the same time. 
Remember: very small actions can have tremendous benefits. So please go ahead and share this campaign!

<h3>About</h3>
<p>The creation of something special... That is what this is. We are working hard to create a prototype and eventually produce at large scale a filter that attaches to the exhaust of vehicles. As of now, we only have CAD renderings, and are playing with different designs. For us to be as successful as possible, we need funding to help cover our expenses for consults, modeling, and production of the working prototypes. Now, as for what this product is meant to do! The world we live in today is in many places full of heavy traffic, with a whole slew of cars, trucks, motorbikes, and more out on the streets. To cut down on pollution, we have catalytic converters that help to turn all of the harmful byproduct and fumes from an engine into less dangerous chemicals. The problem is, we are still polluting at an alarming rate. Sure we can't yet completely stop pollution on these combustion engines using gasoline and diesel, BUT we can help a little more. This product uses the power of activated carbon to absorb some of those dangerous byproducts not caught by the catalytic converter, as well as the byproducts of the catalytic converter itself such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Say you are an eco friendly person, you can put one of these bad boys on, and help the world out an extra little bit. Now some people may say one person can't change the world, which is why we are trying to bring this to a large scale. All of us who care enough to take that little extra step to help out can come together and bring down pollution from vehicles substantially overall. Cities can implement these filters onto non-electric city buses, we can use them on heavy machinery, semi-trucks, and oh so much more. Or, in another manner, say your car no longer meets emission standards. Just grab one of these filters, pop it on your exhaust, and boom! You are good to go. We are meticulously working to come up with a good solution, and design the best product possible. This means taking into consideration the hot temperatures of exhaust, heat expansion, heat resistant material, and much more. But to get to that big, large scale wonder, we need to start small. Teamwork makes the dream work, and with your help, we can all be a part of the bigger picture. Want to see what we have so far? Take a look at these CAD renderings of what we have going on. Our goal is to create a physical prototype, and that is what we are going to do!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As mentioned in our story, we are well aware of some challenges, and as with any startup and prototyping there are risks. We are very hard at work to plan out and overcome these challenges. The biggest challenges include airflow, exhaust temperatures, and efficiency in general. After brainstorming, we were able to devise ways to help overcome these challenges. For airflow, we have created a special inner design, allowing airflow while still holding up to efficiency and containing enough activated carbon. To overcome temperatures, we plan to cast/print our design out of metal, to deal with the temperatures of nature and the exhaust itself. Taking into account thermal expansion, we have created a design that attaches onto the exhaust in a manner that actually allows the inner cylinder to expand and retract based on temperature. Risks include not having enough funding, and having to revise the original schematics. Other risks may include run of the mill things that come with the nature of start ups. Our end of the road may come, and the prototype may not work, and we could lose all of our work. If there isn't enough traction in the target market, we may not be able to continue. We will do all we can to prevent this and make our idea successful, but just remember, teamwork makes the dream work!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I am Manuel Lonfat, an atmospheric physicist, environmentalist and avid ultra cyclist. I founded Quambio a year ago with the vision to help reduce CO2 emissions through individual actions.</p>
<p>Every second, a car emits enough CO2 to fill a cube with 8cm sides, just enough to fit in one hand. Each journey in a car generates hundreds such cubes. In fact, every 100km a car emits as much CO2 as an adult tree is capable of removing from the atmosphere annually.</p>
<p><strong><i>The best way to reduce CO2 is to not emit it. </i></strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to promote the reduction of personal emissions by encouraging people to use soft mobility for everyday activities, such as commuting to work, grocery shopping or children's activities.</p>
<p>We have created a mobile App to track reductions related to soft mobility and to reward people for not emitting CO2, with a system of challenges and incentives .</p>
<p>Our partners, such as insurers and companies with sustainable products, offer discounts in exchange for the reductions. For an insurer, fewer kilometers driven means less risk and more active people are healthier people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We seek to raise 25'000CHF to bring our mobile App to market. We have a working prototype, which is capable of recording trips and converting the information into an CO2 impact.</p>
<p>The App is not yet very pretty though. We will spend the money we raise on funding professional development of our user interface and to make your experience in the platform as cool as possible.</p>
<p>If we achieve partial funding, we will put all of it towards the goal of bringing the App to market. This may result in narrowing down somewhat the number of features we can deliver at first however. </p>
<p>Check our prototype in this video...</p>

<h3>Our Sustainability Model</h3>
<p>Being sustainable is really important to us and starts with our tech. A non intrusive App is key to us because there is no point reducing personal emissions if it results in a lot of new tech emissions.</p>
<p>We pay attention to how servers are powered, what kind of data we need to store, and how frequently we need to email our community, for example.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello! I am Manuel Lonfat, an atmospheric physicist, environmentalist and avid ultra cyclist. I founded Quambio a year ago with the vision to help reduce CO2 emissions through individual actions.
Every second, a car emits enough CO2 to fill a cube with 8cm sides, just enough to fit in one hand. Each journey in a car generates hundreds such cubes. In fact, every 100km a car emits as much CO2 as an adult tree is capable of removing from the atmosphere annually.
The best way to reduce CO2 is to not emit it. 
Our mission is to promote the reduction of personal emissions by encouraging people to use soft mobility for everyday activities, such as commuting to work, grocery shopping or children's activities.
We have created a mobile App to track reductions related to soft mobility and to reward people for not emitting CO2, with a system of challenges and incentives .
Our partners, such as insurers and companies with sustainable products, offer discounts in exchange for the reductions. For an insurer, fewer kilometers driven means less risk and more active people are healthier people.

 
What We Need
We seek to raise 25'000CHF to bring our mobile App to market. We have a working prototype, which is capable of recording trips and converting the information into an CO2 impact.
The App is not yet very pretty though. We will spend the money we raise on funding professional development of our user interface and to make your experience in the platform as cool as possible.
If we achieve partial funding, we will put all of it towards the goal of bringing the App to market. This may result in narrowing down somewhat the number of features we can deliver at first however. 
Check our prototype in this video...

 
What You Get
We will be giving you early access to the App and to new initiatives and offers from our partners (retailers and making of sustainable goods and services).
Additionally:

We will give you 1 Quambio cube for each Swiss franc contributed above 10 CHF
If you contribute 25 CHF or above, we'll give you 2 Quambio cubes for each CHF
If you contribute 100 CHF or more, we'll raise that number to 3 cubes for each Swiss franc
Above 500 CHF, we will match each Swiss franc contributed with 4 cubes and at 1000 CHF, you'll get 5 cubes for each CHF contributed!

In the App, one Quambio cube is earned every about 10km covered using soft mobility. Cubes will be redeemable for rebates on partners' products and services. 
But there is more:

Manuel will ride his bicycle to anyone who contributes 500 Swiss franc or more, as long as it is within 250km of his home in Neuchâtel (250km is half way to Paris!)
At 1000 CHF, Manuel will not only travel to you but also discuss climate issues in the context of your area or your business.

<p>Help us by supporting this crowdfunding campaign to give everyone emergency power when ""The Grid"" goes down due to natural disasters like: hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fires and high winds.  Sometimes it goes down for many other reasons.  Solar flares or military EMP can take The Grid down - be prepared.</p>
<p>We really felt for the victims of last year's natural disasters.  <a href=""https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2017-11-11-moments-hurricane-season-atlantic-irma-maria-harvey"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hurricanes: Harvey, Irma and Maria</a>.</p>

<p>Even people with solar panels on their roofs were without power.  Grid-Tie solar power systems are controlled remotely by the Grid Operators.  They shut down customers with solar panels.  Check the ""fine print"" of your contract.</p>
<h3>Never be without electricity again...</h3>
<p>The Emergency Solar Power Briefcase is designed to supply power twenty four hours per day, seven days a week.   During the day, the advanced solar cells product more than one kilowatt of power per day during full sun conditions.   Completely quiet, not even a fan to make noise.  In cases of emergency, you don't want to let the bad guys know you have power.</p>
<p>The powerful Lithium Ion batteries continue to supply power even after the sun goes down.  You can power an electric blanket for example.  One electric blanket we tested consumes 40 watts per hour.  This means our 1KW (One KiloWatt) system could power an electric blanket twenty hours a day and the batteries would be totally charged in full sun the next day.  Typically, you would use the electric blanket while you sleep or maybe seven hours in a twenty four hour period.</p>
<p>Only our 1KW (Kilo-Watt) system can power a 600 or 700 watt microwave oven.  The peak current required is approximately 60 amps at 12 volts (720 watts).  The 1KW system can provide 12 volts at 80 amps, continuously.   Typically,  cook or heat up food in about 3 minutes with a microwave.  This is only 35 watt hours of power.  The solar panels produce 100 watts per hours.  Thus, it only takes 20 minutes to replace this power in the batteries by the solar panels.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>The solar cells are the latest highest efficiency back contact solar cells available.  They produce more power than standard silicon cells  plus the cells are extremely rugged.  These cells are 24 percent efficient.  We developed a proprietary encapsulation method to encase the rugged cells to protect them.  Only Solar Power Corp. systems utilizes this technology. </p>
<p>Our solar panels are just one eight of an inch thick.   Our 120 watt folding panels are rated at 120 watts peak power in optimal conditions.  You get more power per square inch from our solar panels than most panels.  We tested our encapsulated panels for performance.  Under over-cast weather conditions, these amazing panels produce 50 percent of their rated power.  With full sun angles of 45 degrees, they generate about 60 percent of their rated power.  Truly amazing performance for solar panels.</p>
<p>The proprietary computer controller was developed over the last two years by our founder and president Don Golding.  The intelligent controller monitors all aspects of the system optimizing the solar panel, the battery charging plus the load all at the same time.  During the day, the solar panels are generating more that 100 watts per hour nominally (120 watts peak power rating).  The system will power a load during the day plus charge the batteries: all at the same time.  Solar charge controllers with this capability typically cost more than five hundred dollars by themselves.</p>
<p>The powerful lithium battery packs are custom manufactured to our specifications.  These 12 volt 250 watt (20AH) battery packs can supply 20 amps, continuously, 40 amps peak.  The 500 watt (40AH) Solar Power Briefcase has two battery packs supplying 40 amps of continuous power.  The 1KW (80AH) includes four battery packs providing a whopping 80 amps of continuous power.  Use the 1KW system if you want to power a microwave oven.</p>
<p>Emergency Solar Power Briefcases can be connected in parallel for any amount of portable power you need.</p>
<p>The system has an 80 amp auxiliary rated plugs for cascading or for use with very high power loads.</p>
<h3>Typical uses:</h3>
<p>When camping or at the beach, keep your food cold using a min-fridge - forget the cumbersome ice chest.  Charge two phones directly.  Using an external inverter: charge your power tool batteries, run your laptop or tablet.  You can power any device designed to plug into the car's cigarette lighter.  Heated blankets, coolers, high power spotlights.  A blender and portable cooker are also available.</p>

I have started many high tech companies in my career with over 25 years experience as a an entrepreneur/inventor/engineer.  I am tenacious: I love to tackle great challenges.  The bigger the challenge the better.  Currently, designing embedded computer systems including writing the the software for them.  Technical Skills: Electrical Engineering, Programming plus Mechanical Engineering.  We have a research and development area in our building.  I dream up new products, design the electronics, design the physical form factor, then, write the code to make it all work.  My team builds the prototypes and then we test/refine the products.  We have over 3,000 square feet in the same building for manufacturing finished products by the hundreds.
We have five more new and exciting products for the crowdfunding community: I will bring them to you over the next two years all using the sun as their primary power source.  This is why I founded: Solar Power Corp.
A little history
Space-Tek, Inc. (1979-1984) - Developed the first of its kind computer (CAS-1000)  for real-time ultrasound scanners for use with obstetrical exams.   I also developed a real-time scan converter using state-of-the-art components.
Angelus Research Corp. (1990-2002) - I have a passion to build intelligent machines - try to build in intelligence into all products I developed.  I developed a revolutionary new three level Robot OS called: ""The Triune OS.""  The first product was named ""Whiskers"" in 1991.   We sold over 2,000 Whiskers intelligent robots mostly in technology education courses across the US and Canada.  Articles:Lights Out Factories, Intelligent motion controller mimics brain's structure
In 1996, I was contracted by Col. John Blitch of US Special Forces to develop a new intelligent man-packable mobile robot to demonstrate small robot capabilities for the US military. 
Solar Power Corp. (2017-current)
I founded this company in order to bring innovative solar power products to the masses.  Working on the core technology needed for new 24/7 sun powered products over the past two years.  We are ready to go into production with our first product:the Emergency Solar Power Briefcase.  I have five more product ideas on the drawing board - stay tuned!

Other Ways You Can Help
We came up with a cool T-Shirt to promote solar power.  Consider buying a shirt to promote solar power.  Please tell friends, co-workers and family about this important new product.  It may very well save one of your loved-one's lives, someday.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Unfortunately, the need to condense space has put a damper on what products you can offer. Want to grow tall plants like hops, tomatoes, taller strains of cannabis? Sure, you could spend your free time painstakingly training the plant by hand, but who's got the time?That's why we created the world's first automatic plant trainer. Trella's device gently trains the plant to grow horizontally while keeping it healthy and free of human contaminants. Plants trained with our device on average grow faster and produce higher yields than plants that have undergone manual training.
The best part? Our device is designed to work with existing setups, whether you're a commercial grower or a craft cultivator. Finally, an automated plant trainer designed to be used on the floor or in-racks, with any grow light or grow media. You control the environment, our device will control the plant.

Now, we're prepared to show our device to the world and bring together a community that's as dedicated to indoor farming as we are.
See It in Action!  What Trella Stands ForNo matter who you are or where you come from, you need plants. Every day we use plants for food, scientific use, or healing and medical use. Yet we look around and see a changing world. Arable farmland and outdoor spaces are shrinking every day. Indoor farming is the future. But as far as it’s come, it’s still prohibitive for many. It’s expensive, limited by space, and an energy hog to boot. We created Trella Technologies in November 2016 to do our part for the future of farming. We’re not farmers, but a pair of mechanical engineers with a conscience. Our mission: make indoor farming accessible, sustainable, and market-friendly through tech-driven solutions.Meet the TeamOur first mission was inspired by CEO Aja Atwood's troubles with growing tall plants in her own basement. Instead of busting a hole in her ceiling or moving her plants, she researched plant training in-depth. As a mechanical engineer, she was shocked to find that her only option to get those plants in line was to train them manually. In a world with self-driving cars, why can't we have a self-training plant? So, together with co-founder Andres ""Dre"" Chamorro, they got to work on a prototype.Aja N. Atwood, CEOAja is an entrepreneur, team-leader, and cannabis advocate with over 15 years of experience in the engineering industry. She is a mechanical engineer by education and graduated cum laude from Northeastern University. She cut her teeth professionally as an engineering consultant and specialist, working in natural catastrophe risk engineering, and by 2011 started her first entrepreneurial businesses. Through these experiences, Aja honed her technical skills, fostered the engineering talent of her team, and learned valuable lessons along the way. Aja’s business ethos is rooted in the belief that success comes from creating innovative technologies that can be shared with communities that need them the most.Andres ""Dre"" Chamorro III, VP of EngineeringAndres “Dre” Chamorro has over 15 years of experience in engineering a variety of devices all the way from product design to market. He currently holds more than 20 patents, with another 38 pending. Dre is an experienced manager as well and has led teams of engineers and designers through every step of product development. He was a co-founder of Cambridge Endoscopic Devices, Inc. where he developed 29 products for the medical industry.Where We Are and Where We're GoingWe've spent the last two years designing and testing our device, and gathering input from local growers. Now, we’re ready to make our working prototype fully indoor-farm ready. But to do that, we need financial fuel and the help of industrial designers, software engineers to develop our user-interface app, and others to get us to the next level.This campaign is just the first step. With your help, we'll make a batch of test units for beta testing by growers throughout the community. Then, with their input and guidance, we'll fine-tune our device, and prepare further opportunities for community engagement, and investment.Creating a Trella CommunityThis campaign's goal goes far beyond product development and prototypes. We're using this opportunity to open our doors and create a community of growers, techies, and horticulture enthusiasts to join us as we design more innovative projects in the future.As the Trella community grows, we'll move on to new designs, new products, and address other challenges facing the indoor farming world. Community is key, and a company is nothing if it doesn't give back. This core belief was the seed for the ""SXG1"" initiative. Through SXG1, we’ll make sure that small community growers aren't out of the technological loop by donating units in proportion to sales.These donated units will go to qualified growers like state-registered medicinal cannabis caregivers and non-profit urban farmers serving ""food deserts"".The Trella Design TeamAs a result of this campaign, we’ll be creating the Trella Design Team. Design Team membership takes you to the front lines of our design process and will include backers, techies, members of the vertical farming community, and beta testers. Members get to vote on important issues (including our product's name and branding!),  join exclusive calls with the Trella team, and provide feedback as our products are developed. Join the design process and help our products get better.The Process So FarThe idea for our plant training device started as a personal project. That was before realizing how much it could help the indoor farming community as a whole. Through building our first two prototypes, we confirmed that automation reduced growth times and increased yield. We've continued making improvements and your contributions will help us make our fifth prototype.Fundraising GoalWe’re a small (and smart) company and we're using crowdfunding as a way to raise the money we need to share our design for more feedback. We want to ensure that our design meets the needs of our end users, so we decided to spend more time and effort on our Beta testing phase. After successful Beta V1 testing, our device will be production ready. The money you contribute will help us with the following:
Cost of goods, materials, and labor for Beta V1 test units.
Software development for our user-interface application.
Lab equipment for further in-house testing.
Social media and marketing efforts to engage with our future users.

Until now!After spending more than 5 years building batteries for our scuba diving and kayak kits, we knew we have the perfect platform to create the ultimate outdoor power bank and thus the creation of the Bixpy PP-166.Combining long-lasting lithium iron phosphate (LiFepO4) cells encased in a rugged and beautiful housing, intuitive electronic interface, and plenty of connectors to power all your personal electronics, this mighty power pack will power your most intense outdoor activities.  Packed with features to make sure you have power for all your devices, yet intuitive and simple to use, the Bixpy PP-166 has been designed to provide you with hours of charging or running time no matter where your adventures take you.  We think it's wrong for your battery to look like it came from under the hood of a car.  So we spent just as much time on the outside as we did on the inside. The PP-166 is thoughtfully designed to fit into all those tight and tiny spaces like your kayak hatch, yet so beautifully designed, you'll be proud to have it sitting on your office desk.  ​ Our lives are now run by personal devices that need charging all of the time. Below is just a simple list of some of the items you can charge using your PP-166 to give you a better idea of what you can expect from this mighty power bank.  Not all devices come with a battery inside. If you spend any time outdoors, you know how frustrating it can be trying to find power for your devices. Now you can stop trying to triage your devices based on which one you think you may need the most. With 166Wh of capacity, you'll be able to run and/or charge multiple devices at the same time for the entire duration of your trip.  The Bixpy SUN45 Solar Panel is the perfect companion to your Bixpy PP-166.  With 45 watts of output from monocrystalline cells, the panel will charge your PP-166 in about 6 to 8 hours.  This increases the battery's useability infinitely, allowing you to truly go off-grid and have reliable, waterproof, weatherproof, long-lasting power no matter where you are and how long you're out for! The Bixpy PP-166 is covered for defects, failures, and workmanship for 2 years after your purchase. No other battery will give you that peace of mind.  In fact, most lead-acid batteries are guaranteed not to work after two years! We delivered on our first campaign with great success and we'll do it again. Your IndieGoGo contribution with us is a  guaranteed purchase. Our tooling has already been made and the bill of material has been sourced and our first production completed with product ready to ship! If we don't deliver on our promise, we will refund your money, no questions asked. We put the new PP-166 into the hands of some hard-core outdoors folks and asked them for feedback and video testimonials.  We were thrilled by the positive feedback and the awesome testimonials.

Its powerful battery can provide 2,000W of power output, just like a standard wall socket!  And it packs a massive 1,700Wh capacity, which means all your devices will stay powered for hours and hours, so you’ll never be stranded without power. No matter when a blackout happens or when you need to fuel your adventure. Feature 4x fast-charging USB ports, 2x 60W PD USB-C ports plus 4x wall outlets (US or Intl).  Lifetime battery warranty (IGG exclusive)!The battery of the MONSTER X is extremely dependable. Monster X is equipped with 3C high-rate lithium-ion batteries, which provides higher capacity at the same size.In the meanwhile, we adopted Tesla's large-rate discharge lithium battery, which can meet the discharge of 3,000 cycles. What's more, a lifetime battery warranty is offered only for you guys on Indiegogo. Don’t be fooled by its size either. This generator is a monster and it definitely has the ‘X’ factor!  The 1700 watt battery is housed in a tough aluminum alloy casing, perfect for all conditions. It has four regular USB ports, two USB-C ports and four wall outlets on both the international and American models. It can power or charge as many as 11 devices simultaneously which can be easily controlled remotely using the Monster X app. MONSTER X does the work while you just do your thing. It is able to power anything you could imagine. Laptop, electric saw, Refrigerator, or even a Tesla, just plug in whatever you need to power. Charge or power up to 11 devices at once. You can even use it as an emergency backup for powering your electric vehicles up to 7.5 extra miles on a single charge.   We designed Monster X with convenience in mind. It is both compact and light weight, so you can take it with you no matter where you go. So if you need to take it out into the woods to power your electric saw, you can.Most of the good electric saws have between a 10-15 amp motor. Running on 110 volts that is between 1,100-1,650 watts of juice without load on it. That's to say,  you can use the electric saw for an hour outside with MONSTER X.  For families who rely on medical devices such like a CPAP machine or a medical fridge, a power outage could be a disaster. But with MONSTER X, you’re always well prepared for the unexpected. MONSTER X is equipped with UPS. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS), offers guaranteed power protection for connected electronics. When power is interrupted, or fluctuates outside safe levels, a UPS will instantly provide clean battery backup power and surge protection for plugged-in, sensitive equipment.The electronic devices you rely on every day for communication, security and entertainment are at risk for damage and failure due to unexpected blackouts, voltage fluctuations or other power disruptions. A UPS provides battery backup power and protection for electronic devices, including: Computers, Televisions, Security systems Gaming consoles, Mobile devices.Besides, Independent charging and discharging circuit modules allow MONSTER X charge and recharge simultaneously. You are always well prepared for any power outages with MONSTER X. This is the best backup source for a power outage. It is quiet in operation and maintenance-free. Finally it can give you enough power to run your essential home appliances. Such as refrigerator, coffee maker, electric grill, electric saw or even a Tesla.  MONSTER X can be recharged through 3 approaches: 200W DC, 400W AC, 200W solar input. Through the three input ways at the same time, it can be loaded to 80% in around 1.5 hours, and to 100% in roughly 2 hours.A major advantage of alternating current is that its voltage can be modified relatively easily using a transformer, which allows power to be transmitted at very high voltages before being taken down to safer voltages for commercial and residential use. Btw, no adapter is needed as well.The biggest advantage of DC electricity is that it is easier to store, especially on a small scale. Storing electricity when it is made, for use later when it is needed. Solar power is pollution free and causes no greenhouse gases to be emitted after installation. Reduced dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels. Renewable clean power that is available every day of the year, even cloudy days produce some power.  MONSTER X has two universal solar inputs which can meet the general standard of all solar installations in the market. Through solar recharging, MONSTER X can be fully charged within 6 hours, while staying green, healthy and productive.Powered by the force of Nature, MONSTER X is compatible with any solar panels or installations in the market. Under perfect sunlight and 200W solar input, it can be fully recharged in about 6 hours.With MONSTER X, you can power everything you need in daily life and work in case of a blackout, or you can go off the grid. Back up your home with a portable solar panel, or directly hook it up with solar installations on the rooftop. MONSTER X can be the reliable generator in an emergency, or the qualified assistant to help you fulfill a green and healthy life. Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is a tracking technology in electronic form. It uses algorithms and controls circuits to search for the maximum power point, so that the converter circuit can obtain the maximum power from the cell module. Both MONSTER X's battery and structure are very powerful. The 1700Wh battery pack is reinforced by aluminum alloy structure, and protected by ABS+PC shed. You will never need to be concerned when you move it or carry it around. The battery of MONSTER X is reliable and endurable. You could always rely on it. Over a dozen international certificates and safety features ensure the reliability and endurance, such as: Short-Circuit Protection, Battery Overcharge Protection, Output Overcharge Protection, Harsh Temperature Protection and so on.An intelligent BMS protects your MONSTER X from power surges and overheating, monitoring and alerting you of any sharp changes in temperature.MONSTER X owns lithium-ion batteries (6 in series), and its state-of-the-art BMS can take full advantage of all series. It can protect any single series from taking too much or too little, so as to maximize the batteries' lifetime and performance. The smart power management system and its sidekick App, through bluetooth, allows you to monitor the Monster X battery whenever. and wherever. You can also turn the outputs on or off as needed.   Our solar panel is made of waterproof oxford cloth and is able to be folded into a smaller size, which makes it more durable, more portable and even lighter. To reach a higher Solar Energy Conversion Rate (22%-25%, much higher than the average rate of 15%), we selected a premium-grade panel and the finest cloth.  ​  ALLPOWERS was founded in 2008. We are a team composed of experienced designers and engineers with a mission to bring the best power products to everyone. In the past 10 years, we've devoted ourselves to R&D of power products.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We’re a bunch of New York energy geeks committed to changing the way you shop for energy. We all have energy bills. For most people, it’s our biggest subscription expense—and almost all of us are overpaying. We do have options, like lower price fixed-rate plans. Or planet-saving green energy. But most of us don’t know it, and the big energy companies win out. </p>
<p>Our website, <a href=""http://www.Ratecompare.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Ratecompare.it</a> is an energy price comparison website which makes it simple to compare energy suppliers and switch to the best plan. We show you the available rates for electricity or natural gas. You pick. We switch you to a better supplier. 5 minutes, and you’ve clawed back value from your local utility monopoly. Or signed up for green energy. And the supplier pays us a commission.<br/> </p>
</div><div>

We’re a bunch of New York energy geeks committed to changing the way you shop for energy. We all have energy bills. For most people, it’s our biggest subscription expense—and almost all of us are overpaying. We do have options, like lower price fixed-rate plans. Or planet-saving green energy. But most of us don’t know it, and the big energy companies win out. 
Our website, www.Ratecompare.it is an energy price comparison website which makes it simple to compare energy suppliers and switch to the best plan. We show you the available rates for electricity or natural gas. You pick. We switch you to a better supplier. 5 minutes, and you’ve clawed back value from your local utility monopoly. Or signed up for green energy. And the supplier pays us a commission.

<p>We are living in time of the global climate change which can cause extreme and devastating weather conditions (extreme cold, wet or hot weather) causing droughts and floods and enormous damage to the local community, economy, agriculture and infrastructure. Agriculture or food production is specially sensitive to these weather extremes as months of care, hard work and investment can be annihilated over night.</p>

Agriculture or food production is specially sensitive to these weather extremes as months of care, hard work and investment can be annihilated over night.
Our team developed AquaSol device that can regulate local micro-climate conditions using proven basic principles of the physics.

<h3>We have come together to launch the Unearth Biochar environmental operation in WA and hope to see our state become the national industry leader for the worldwide biochar movement.</h3>
<p>We want to start up the nation’s first carbon sequestration ‘farm’ using the most sustainable machinery on the world market to convert organic matter into biochar.</p>
<p>Our plan is to sequester carbon into the earth on our property in Gingin, Western Australia, using on-farm biomass.</p>
<p>We want to be carbon-negative, in order to contribute to the reduction of the 16.3 metric tonnes that Australia emits per capita each year (2015 figure).</p>
<p>Research shows that for every one kilo of biochar made, about 50 per cent of that represents carbon that is no longer going into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>That’s half a kilo that is now useful carbon, going into the ground and fertilising the soil, and not being used to make carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>That’s a lot kilos of Carbon, essentially being taken out of the air, and going back into the ground where it can be beneficial to the health of the soil. </p>
<p>This is where you - the environmentally-conscious and carbon emission-aware members of the community come into the picture! </p>
<p>Your donation will contribute towards carbon sequestration in the soil; the restoration of the degraded river system; and the removal of non-indigenous plant species and woody weeds.</p>
<p>We've been trying with our own resources for many years, but we are now at the stage where we want to invite the wider environmental community to help us.</p>
<p>Please tell your friends, family and all you know about our cause and ask them to take part - because no matter where you are in the world, we all need to work towards reducing our Carbon footprint.</p>
<p>For more information about the wonders of biochar, visit our Unearth Biochar facebook page.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have access to 150 acres of riverland which is degraded. It is infested with woody weeds and the river system is choked by pines, preventing the endemic trees and vegetation from growing.  We want to restore the river area back to its original state. All this material can be processed into biochar and energy. </p>
<p>We don't wish to clear and burn this off, causing carbon emissions. Rather, we want to sequester the carbon in the best possible way, returning it to the earth where it belongs.</p>
<p><b>So, the world was searched for the best technology that fitted our criteria of:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>safety and ease of operation </li>
<li>output and carbon capture</li>
<li>it must have no emissions and capture all products it produces (we have decided, but cannot for commercial and IP reasons reveal the name of our choice)</li>
<li>We also require some heavy plant/equipment i.e excavator to carry out minor land works;</li>
<li>A shed</li>
<li>Aquaculture pond liners/irrigation</li>
<li>Consumables</li>
</ul>
<p>The biochar will be sequestered on our property and used to enhance our soils, or given to organic farmers and and producers who wish to use it on their properties instead of chemical fertilisers. </p>
<p>In future, we plan to provide an opportunity for study groups, research and educational institutions to study environmental outcomes. </p>
<p>If we don't succeed in reaching our entire goal this time around, this will not be seen as a failure.</p>
<p>We will still see this as a step forward from which to launch the next stage of our campaign to develop a viable environmental project. We can still take a great step forward to reach the next level in our goal. </p>
<p>We invite anyone who believes in our cause to join us. We acknowledge not everyone owns land, a farm or garden, but now there is an opportunity to be part of the 'carbon for the planet' movement and be a party to the amazing story of biochar and the benefits it can bring. </p>
<p>You can help us to achieve our goals and be on board with your beliefs anytime you want to - the subscription never ends on carbon sequestration! </p>
<p>Together, we can start reversing some of the climate change damage that has been done to our world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have 150 acres of riverland in Gingin, Western Australia which has various soil types, native trees; and a fully-matured decommissioned pine plantation. The property has excellent growing potential, and empty ponds which can later be used for aquaculture.</p>
<p>We want to develop biochar for the soil; aquaculture for fish/crustacea and nutrients production; and agriculture - combining all these resources to create a natural synergy between land use and activity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been toiling to 10 years, using our own resources to clean up a degraded and damaged farming property and producing our own biochar. This is not a commercial venture, it has been an environmental venture. It was always about restoring the land to its best condition.  We want to create a synergy between the various activities that can be done there - aquaculture, organic farming and horticulture. </p>
<p>We have come a long way. But now we want to step up and finish the task. It has always come down to a lack of available capital to achieve the desired outcome. This is why we now what to invite people who care about carbon emissions, soil health, food security and sharing ideas on sustainability to participate, and you don't have to be a land-owner or end user to be involved.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. We would love you to spread the word about our campaign, by using our Indiegogo share tools.</p>

As a professional beekeeper, I work closely with bees and I care about the preservation of biodiversity.In my daily work, I give companies the opportunity to host hives on their sites and I teach young people in order to raise their awareness and convey my passion for bees to them. The greatest problem I encounter in my work is the limitations imposed by the use of the smoker and the harmful effects it has on bees and on the environment.That is why I am seeking to develop my beekeeping practices.After many years of research and teamwork I can now present you with an alternative solution to this essential tool: the Apisolis vaporizer. Beekeepers (amateurs and professionals) are often faced with the need to use a smoker.The use of the smoker is an ancestral practice based on the slow combustion of many fuels which triggers a conditioned reaction in the bees.This practice is somewhat inconsiderate and stressful for the bees. In addition, smoke residues from the wide variety of fuels are harmful to the beekeeper's health (respiratory tract) and are likely to be found in the hive's products.  The answer to these limitations was to create the Apisolis vaporizer: a more convenient, safer tool which is better for bees, for the environment and for people.Apisolis emits only a simple, natural vapour at a temperature of less than 35°, which is respectful to the bees. There are no PAH or fine particle emissions. Comparison chartSeveral scientific studies (1) have concluded that the burning of wood and plants can release toxic substances into the environment: particulate matter (PM), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).Although smoking is a traditional practice, in the light of current knowledge it seems wise to be more concerned about the state of the environment and to be aware that these various toxic substances present the environment can then be found in products from hives.The ""NATIVE"" formula by Apisolis consists of a base which permits steam to be generated. This base is derived from the processing of organically farmed corn syrup and is polypropylene glycol free. The rest of the formula consists only of essential oils from organically farmed plants. All the components are organically sourced and designed to respect the environment and the health of beekeepers, of which I am one.  The vaporizer means beekeepers can look after their hives with peace of mind, whilst respecting the bees.Respect for beesBees have developed in synergy with plants over millions of years. It seems wise to use this remarkable partnership to improve the relationship between beekeepers and bees.The principle is simple: Apisolis emits a sweet, natural vapour around the bees. This vapour is generated using the ""NATIVE"" Apisolis formula.In order to respect the bees to the greatest possible extent, it consists only of natural, bio-sourced components. The compounds are ECOCERT and FDA certified and are 100% natural and sustainable. The ""NATIVE"" formula is the result of several years of research based on scientific protocols. The patent for the formula has been filed. Respect for beekeepers and the environmentApisolis works simply by pressing a button at the beekeeper’s demand, and so greatly reduces the risk of inhalation.What is more, the vaporizer means you can avoid burns or even starting fires. The Apisolis vaporizer is very easy to use, self-contained, very convenient and safe.1. EASY TO USE:To use Apisolis, simply press the power button.You can also adjust the amount of vapour by squeezing the bellows.2. SAFE:The vaporizer's temperature is regulated automatically and a gentle, even vapour is produced. The vapour is only produced on demand. It is turned off very easily by pressing the power button a couple of times, which means the risk of fires while carrying is avoided.3. SELF-CONTAINED:Thanks to Apisolis you can visit to up to 100 hives with the contents of one tank. To recharge Apisolis, simply plug it into a USB port (the cigarette lighter of your car,for example).

At the same time, water density is approximately 800 times greater than the density of air that allows receiving energy easier. The estimated efficiency of our generator has to exceed the efficiency of the existing “green” technologies and to get closer to the efficiency of thermal and nuclear power plants. At once without any harmful emissions and threat of radioactive infection. Point absorber which is attached to the bottom1.Gathers energy from a small part of the front of a wave.2.It requires the use of springs or counterweight. This fact reduces the efficiency of work because of additional expenses for energy.   Point absorber which is established on the rigid basis (ashore)1.Complexity of orientation on the waves.2.Possibility of damage caused by waves because of the rigid basis.  Attenuator 1.Gathers energy from a small part of the front of a wave.2.The efficiency sharply decreases at increase in the period of a wave.  Point absorber with Heave plate1.The efficiency sharply decreases at increase in the period of a wave.2.It doesn't allow to make full use of the wave amplitude since it is always partially displaced in the direction of the movement of a wave. Advantages of GETMOREter:1.Works without springs and counterbalances, at the expense of own weight and displacement.2.Takes energy both with a growth, and at recession of a wave.3.Easily can orient itself in the direction of distribution of waves and also gathers energy from a wide sector of the front of a wave.4.Effectively works at change of the period of waves and it can use practically any wave. (It’s a joke! GETMOREter won't be able to use very small wave which won't be able to create the necessary force for operation of the generator. But taking into account calculation of parameters of the generator under a concrete installation site, such situation is almost impossible).5.Easily deviates at extreme blows of waves and avoids destruction.1. The floating buoy – deploys GETMORETER along the front of a wave and allows to receive more energy.2. The suspension – holds floating buoy.3. Guides – set the movement to rods.4. Rods – transmit the movement to a generator shaft and work serially at growth and recession of a wave.5. The supporting buoy – forms the basis of the generator and returns construction in vertical position.6. The anchor cable – fixes GETMOREter to the basis and allows it to deviate and rotate freely by 360 degrees.7. The basis – remains GETMOREter at the bottom and serves as the house for sea inhabitants as an artificial reef. Prototype Demonstrator #1 (November 2017)Scale 1:20 Prototype #2 (May 2018)We have already built the Prototype Demonstrator #1 and also Scale 1:20 Prototype #2. The last one was tested under real sea conditions and, of course, all of the results were successful.  Prototype Demonstrator #1 in action Real sea testing of the Scale 1:20 Prototype #2 Nowadays the cost of installation of a new source of renewable energy is about 1500$ on 1 kW of rated capacity for wind generators and about 1000$ on 1 kW for solar panels.Further, with the introduction of technology, GETMOREter’s cost has to become less than the cost of wind power generators and has to approach the cost of solar panels that will allow it to gain popularity around the world! But now, for development and creation of the first sample, we will need a little more means.We consider that the amount collected (237 000 €) will allow us to create the full-scale GETMOREter’s model with a power of 100 kW taking into account the cost of the gifts to donators and other overhead costs.The power of 100 kW will allow to provide with net and cheap energy up to 40 houses. We want to assemble and establish GETMOREter in the Portuguese Pilot zone (http://oceanplug.pt/en-GB).

<li>Forest Fire take away homes, wildlife, as well as vegetation. All of the inhabitants of the wildlife environment now are found homeless. People often lose their houses as well if the fires are close enough to human housing. Vegetation is now obsolete if this area is near a farm or near the food of other inhabitants. Millions of dollars are spent repairing these damages and re-building homes and areas of vegetation.</li>
<li>The soil in the area of the Forest Fire has been completely destroyed. The soils in the forest are made with decaying nutrients and debris that have a lot of natural ingredients that help make the earth what it is. When a forest fire hits this soil, it becomes too hot and all of those nutrients are gone for good.</li>
<li>Animals lose their lives. It is sad but true fact that birds, squirrels, rabbits, and other wildlife animals are no longer a part of this great earth.</li>
<li>Trees and plants are gone as well. Trees and plants help to produce oxygen in the world. The less trees and plants there are the less clean air we have to breathe. With no plants or trees, the animals that did survive no longer have anything to eat.</li>
<li>Too much water in the soil can cause erosion. Firefighters use a great deal of water to put out these vicious forest fire. Too much water in the soil causes it to erode and make it useless.</li>
<li>Large amounts of smoke are released into the air which makes it difficult to breathe and also causes air pollution.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, some human lives are also lost in Forest Fire. Typically, people who are fighting the fire who lose their lives trying to save others.</li>
<li>Ash and smoke can cause serious health problems to humans who suffer from allergies and other medical problems. This same smoke and ash has the ability to permanently damage the lungs and the throat.</li>
<li>Incomes and jobs are lost for workers in the agricultural field whose field crops and animals were destroyed by the Forest Fire. When people are out of work, the economy suffers which makes it difficult to recover.</li>
<li>Insurance premiums soar sky high after a Forest Fire because now everyone is looking to obtain some kind of insurance to prevent such devastating losses. People are unable to afford these premiums even when they need them the most.</li>
<li>There will be restricted recreational areas that will not be able to be accessed until the area is clear of debris and is determined to be safe to inhabit or visit.</li>
<li>The loss of animals has the ability to also create extinction for certain animals and other creatures of the forest.</li>

<td style=""width:408px;""><p>An enclosed fire may include some or all of the following phases of development: (1) incipient phase, (2) growth phase (pre-flashover), (3) flashover, (4) fully developed phase (post-flashover), (5) decay phase, and (6) extinction. Ignition is the start of fire development. The duration of the “incipient” period, shown in above figure, is dependent on a variety of factors including the fuel type, physical situation, and quantity of available oxygen. Heat generation increases during this period, producing light to moderate volumes of smoke. The characteristic smell of smoke is usually the first indication that an incipient fire is underway. Early detection at this stage, either human or automatic, can control the fire before significant losses occur if it is followed by a timely response from qualified fire-fighting professionals.</p></td>

The value-added products generated using satellite imagery helps in addressing the information needs covering all the phases of disaster management such as, preparedness, early warning, response, relief, rehabilitation, recovery and mitigation across the globe.GORM – I program is divided into 4 phases with each phase containing a milestone that we want to achieve.  Phases Information:Phase I: (Q2-Q3 2017): Ready to launchFor Phase I launch, we’ll deploy our solution to a Forest in India and will capture the temporal and spatial data for our further research followed by deployment in next forest. Requirements Detailed:Software Application:

Forest Fire take away homes, wildlife, as well as vegetation. All of the inhabitants of the wildlife environment now are found homeless. People often lose their houses as well if the fires are close enough to human housing. Vegetation is now obsolete if this area is near a farm or near the food of other inhabitants. Millions of dollars are spent repairing these damages and re-building homes and areas of vegetation.
The soil in the area of the Forest Fire has been completely destroyed. The soils in the forest are made with decaying nutrients and debris that have a lot of natural ingredients that help make the earth what it is. When a forest fire hits this soil, it becomes too hot and all of those nutrients are gone for good.
Animals lose their lives. It is sad but true fact that birds, squirrels, rabbits, and other wildlife animals are no longer a part of this great earth.
Trees and plants are gone as well. Trees and plants help to produce oxygen in the world. The less trees and plants there are the less clean air we have to breathe. With no plants or trees, the animals that did survive no longer have anything to eat.
Too much water in the soil can cause erosion. Firefighters use a great deal of water to put out these vicious forest fire. Too much water in the soil causes it to erode and make it useless.
Large amounts of smoke are released into the air which makes it difficult to breathe and also causes air pollution.
Unfortunately, some human lives are also lost in Forest Fire. Typically, people who are fighting the fire who lose their lives trying to save others.
Ash and smoke can cause serious health problems to humans who suffer from allergies and other medical problems. This same smoke and ash has the ability to permanently damage the lungs and the throat.
Incomes and jobs are lost for workers in the agricultural field whose field crops and animals were destroyed by the Forest Fire. When people are out of work, the economy suffers which makes it difficult to recover.
Insurance premiums soar sky high after a Forest Fire because now everyone is looking to obtain some kind of insurance to prevent such devastating losses. People are unable to afford these premiums even when they need them the most.
There will be restricted recreational areas that will not be able to be accessed until the area is clear of debris and is determined to be safe to inhabit or visit.
The loss of animals has the ability to also create extinction for certain animals and other creatures of the forest.
  Why we choose Smoke Detection over Forest Fire as our detection technique? 

An enclosed fire may include some or all of the following phases of development: (1) incipient phase, (2) growth phase (pre-flashover), (3) flashover, (4) fully developed phase (post-flashover), (5) decay phase, and (6) extinction. Ignition is the start of fire development. The duration of the “incipient” period, shown in above figure, is dependent on a variety of factors including the fuel type, physical situation, and quantity of available oxygen. Heat generation increases during this period, producing light to moderate volumes of smoke. The characteristic smell of smoke is usually the first indication that an incipient fire is underway. Early detection at this stage, either human or automatic, can control the fire before significant losses occur if it is followed by a timely response from qualified fire-fighting professionals.
  Other Smoke Detection Characteristics:
Early-sign of Forest Fire
95% of the Forest Fire contains Smoke
Reaches high altitude quicker than Fire
Easy to get in Field of View
Can prevent Forest Fire
 Fire and Smoke Detection Ground SamplesWatch our DPDA software in action. Running and actively detecting Smoke and displaying various information and parameters.      The ImpactBringing in a solution for Forest Fire Pre-Disaster alerts would be of great significance. We can save millions of lives, nature’s beauty, infrastructure destruction and much more. Imagine that if we can predict or detect Forest fire in-time (during its incipient phase), we can save tons of Oxygen, Trees, Forest land, herbs, essentials, animals and other wildlife. OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE TO MOTHER NATUREAt the individual level, we can follow these practices:
Plant trees.
Produce less waste (don't buy products you don't need).
Use eco-friendly products instead of plastics, chemicals and toxins.
Buy organic products to encourage organic farming.
Conserve energy by not wasting resources - water, electricity, gas.
Use eco-friendly transportation (walk, cycle, public transport).
 At global level, we need to transform our education system:
Unmoderated production of unwanted goods for profit.
Develop eco-friendly technologies rather than working on profit friendly technology.
The technical and medical education institutes teach us building items in an isolated way, rather than taking in the effect of these practices on nature. It would be great if we think beyond the system and evaluate them.
  We Need Your Help!Your contribution is very important, and there are many other ways you can help:
Use the share tools provided by INDIEGOGO to circulate to your friends and encourage them to help us achieve our goal.
Use different social media channels to direct traffic to this campaign.
Your contribution will make the world safer, greener, healthier and stronger.

Please visit: www.trashlessatx.com.  This campaign is no longer active and is not monitored anymore.  Let's Go Trashless From pantry items to household cleaning supplies - most common consumer products come in single-use packaging - which is ecologically damaging and economically expensive to produce, transport, use, discard or recycle. Trashless (TM) will deliver common household products directly to local consumers in reusable containers, picking up the empty containers and delivering refills when prompted via a simple tap of a button on the Trashless mobile phone app.  Delivering products that are locally sourced and sustainably produced, Trashless will add extra layers of sustainability to this new low carbon footprint way households consume products.It's like The Milkman for Everything (TM). The difference: This milkman is powered by sophisticated technology, efficient production processes, and optimized logistics.  What, How Much, When & Where? From pantry items such as oils, honey, coffee & condiments to cleaning supplies such as laundry detergent and hand soap, Trashless will deliver these most commonly consumed products on a flexible refill subscription basis (read on for more details).Per unit, Trashless’ will price its products at around the same levels as similar products available in grocery stores in the same area - making it a no-brainer for consumers.The Trashless online store on Loconomy.com with the initial product list and pricing is slated to go live on March 15. Perks credits will be issued by April 1. Deliveries will begin by the end of April.  Trashless will first begin service in the Greater Austin, Texas, area. Read on for expansion plans.   Who We Are Trashless is a new service from Austin, Texas based Lettuce Networks, Inc. - which runs a thriving, profitable, local meal-kit delivery service in Austin called Lettuce, as well as Loconomy.com - a hyper local ecommerce, engagement and logistics technology platform.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>ODIN Materials, Inc. is founded and operated by Doc and Rebecca Hudson in order to provide sustainable materials from renewable resources using regenerative processes. In short, we use climate-saving techniques to create materials using resources that can be replaced. We are a married founding team and dedicated to the success of our planet for the generations behind us. </p>
<ul>
<li>We use resources that also sequester carbon</li>
<li>Resources are used to create necessary building materials</li>
<li>These materials are more efficient than traditional building materials</li>
</ul>
<p>The prices of building materials and their effects on the environment need to change. We can make better, sustainable building products with less impact and lower cost. We all use lumber at some point, whether it is a home project or for a trade, lumber is a massive necessity. IT CAN BE BETTER.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Meat and Potatoes</h3>
<p>In order for us to create Dope Wood, we will need to fabricate a prototype for our wood press, purchase classifying equipment to separate fibers, obtain proper licensing, and hire talented individuals to be a part of our team. Once we have these things in place, we will be able to acquire hemp biomass from local farmers and start creating Dope Wood!</p>
<p>Our prototype will serve as the first step toward our goal of replacing traditional timber-based dimensional lumber. Trees are a valuable asset against climate change, this is a way to prevent the loss of such an asset. The growth cycle of hemp is much quicker than that of trees. This means we can plant and harvest more often than what is done now and in many places, not unlike trees, hemp can grow year-round with minimal water consumption. Pressing Dope Wood will be simplified by our system. The press will apply adhesive, heat, and pressure in one cycle. Once the wood is pressed, we will dry it and cure it in order to store it for a predetermined amount of time before we supply it to distributors and directly to customers. Our prototype will help us nail down and perfect these processes in order to hit a much larger production value. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being able to stamp our lumber out of hemp rather than cutting down and milling trees will provide many advantages in logistical and mill costs. Every contribution brings us one step closer to providing a cheaper and more sustainable wood product. </p>
<p>We started this journey several years ago living in Boise, Idaho. Even then, before Covid, lumber prices were high for the consumer. Not nearly as bad now, but still high. This led us to research alternatives, mainly in hemp. As a military veteran and spouse, we are firm advocates for the benefits of cannabis and are always working to disprove the stigmas. We worked hard during a pandemic to start our very own hemp farm in Ontario, Oregon in order to serve veterans with PTSD and provide the CBD/CBG that they need. Hudson Farms, LLC. was established in September of 2020 on 19 acres of land with ~6 acres that are currently registered with the ODA to grow hemp. We intend to add 5 more acres of hemp and a greenhouse next year. We currently have a CBD variety crop growing and we intend to use a portion of the flower for adhesive R and D for Dope Wood and the biomass will go towards building materials. Our intention is to use as much of every type of biomass possible, so we can provide an outlet for waste rather than it being burned in a field or used as ditch filler. We also hope that this will be an outlet for crops that have too high of a THC content and do not meet state-specific and federal regulations. These crops are typically disposed of by burning which is also not good for the environment. Dope Wood could be the green alternative and use that biomass in a renewable way.</p>
<p>Our process of turning hemp into dimensional lumber will make a large impact on all lumber prices. By introducing a structurally more efficient and cheaper product than current lumber, we will shift some of the focus from traditional lumber which will even out the supply and demand. Putting our products directly into the housing market will also help us lower the cost of home construction. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have faced many difficult challenges and have overcome quite a bit to get to this point. This determination is our largest asset, but we are aware that there are always controlling factors that work beyond our means. The largest risk we take is that the press we design does not work as intended. Risk mitigation is a very important and valuable tool in this area, we understand the risk of mechanical failures and imperfections, we also know how to be proactive towards these risks.</p>
<p>Any company deciding to take on the global lumber industry must understand the parameters of that challenge, we are ready. Hemp is a miraculous plant and can take many forms, many more than a tree can. Lumber is only the beginning. ODIN Materials is focused on the creation of sustainable materials, we intend to make everything from aeronautics materials to textiles with some energy components in between. We view the challenge of the lumber industry as just our first step in providing people with sustainable and affordable materials. </p>

In short, we use climate-saving techniques to create materials using resources that can be replaced. We are a married founding team and dedicated to the success of our planet for the generations behind us. 

We use resources that also sequester carbon
Resources are used to create necessary building materials
These materials are more efficient than traditional building materials

The prices of building materials and their effects on the environment need to change. We can make better, sustainable building products with less impact and lower cost. We all use lumber at some point, whether it is a home project or for a trade, lumber is a massive necessity. IT CAN BE BETTER.

Meat and Potatoes
In order for us to create Dope Wood, we will need to fabricate a prototype for our wood press, purchase classifying equipment to separate fibers, obtain proper licensing, and hire talented individuals to be a part of our team. Once we have these things in place, we will be able to acquire hemp biomass from local farmers and start creating Dope Wood!
Our prototype will serve as the first step toward our goal of replacing traditional timber-based dimensional lumber. Trees are a valuable asset against climate change, this is a way to prevent the loss of such an asset. The growth cycle of hemp is much quicker than that of trees. This means we can plant and harvest more often than what is done now and in many places, not unlike trees, hemp can grow year-round with minimal water consumption. Pressing Dope Wood will be simplified by our system. The press will apply adhesive, heat, and pressure in one cycle. Once the wood is pressed, we will dry it and cure it in order to store it for a predetermined amount of time before we supply it to distributors and directly to customers. Our prototype will help us nail down and perfect these processes in order to hit a much larger production value. 

The Impact
Being able to stamp our lumber out of hemp rather than cutting down and milling trees will provide many advantages in logistical and mill costs. Every contribution brings us one step closer to providing a cheaper and more sustainable wood product. 
We started this journey several years ago living in Boise, Idaho. Even then, before Covid, lumber prices were high for the consumer. Not nearly as bad now, but still high. This led us to research alternatives, mainly in hemp. As a military veteran and spouse, we are firm advocates for the benefits of cannabis and are always working to disprove the stigmas. We worked hard during a pandemic to start our very own hemp farm in Ontario, Oregon in order to serve veterans with PTSD and provide the CBD/CBG that they need. Hudson Farms, LLC. was established in September of 2020 on 19 acres of land with ~6 acres that are currently registered with the ODA to grow hemp. We intend to add 5 more acres of hemp and a greenhouse next year. We currently have a CBD variety crop growing and we intend to use a portion of the flower for adhesive R and D for Dope Wood and the biomass will go towards building materials. Our intention is to use as much of every type of biomass possible, so we can provide an outlet for waste rather than it being burned in a field or used as ditch filler. We also hope that this will be an outlet for crops that have too high of a THC content and do not meet state-specific and federal regulations. These crops are typically disposed of by burning which is also not good for the environment. Dope Wood could be the green alternative and use that biomass in a renewable way.
Our process of turning hemp into dimensional lumber will make a large impact on all lumber prices. By introducing a structurally more efficient and cheaper product than current lumber, we will shift some of the focus from traditional lumber which will even out the supply and demand. Putting our products directly into the housing market will also help us lower the cost of home construction. 

Risks & Challenges
We have faced many difficult challenges and have overcome quite a bit to get to this point. This determination is our largest asset, but we are aware that there are always controlling factors that work beyond our means. The largest risk we take is that the press we design does not work as intended. Risk mitigation is a very important and valuable tool in this area, we understand the risk of mechanical failures and imperfections, we also know how to be proactive towards these risks.
Any company deciding to take on the global lumber industry must understand the parameters of that challenge, we are ready. Hemp is a miraculous plant and can take many forms, many more than a tree can. Lumber is only the beginning. ODIN Materials is focused on the creation of sustainable materials, we intend to make everything from aeronautics materials to textiles with some energy components in between. We view the challenge of the lumber industry as just our first step in providing people with sustainable and affordable materials. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We are developing the next step in materials manufacturing and product creation, not a whole lot of people know about it. If you are unable to contribute, please help us in spreading the word! we can be found on Twitter at @inc_odin and our website is www.odinmaterials.com. Not only are we helping to overcome ridiculous lumber prices and deforestation, but we are also trying to build better manufacturing practices for others to follow.

In most of the conditions no power outlet is available and then we have to switch to batteries but they also soon gets off. So this solar power unit is designed to power your devices easily with very high power efficiency.Why use solar power for low power applications?Solar power is most easiest and most practical way to produce energy and to drive our future to a better tomorrow. However, solar power is not just a niche! One day, we will all be using solar power for every small and big applications and then solar energy would not be a non conventional source of energy. By using solar power for low power applications, we are taking big step towards solar power for small electronic devices. This enables a new class of embedded systems.When you have a project like weather station, remote data logger, etc. or applications like this, you do not have to keep your sensing units on all the time. And of course in all this applications, powering is the major issue. If you turn on the the unit in 5 minute, it can save a lot energy. This unit has time delay of 5 minutes. The unit can also power your units when there is no sunlight(at night) as it has a rechargeable battery inside.It's not just a solar powering unit and not just a timer. It's a combination of both of them!Moreover this powering unit has a low voltage sensor which switches the unit to run on battery power when there is not enough sunlight.Features:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've always dreamed to explore the world, to understand its unique mechanisms and to help us humans to use it properly creating a future without destroying it. My name is Todor Mihaylov, a renewable energy engineer, teacher and artist, always asking questions and creating things.</p>
<p>I've started this project in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Varna, Bulgaria</a> with Stiliyan Hvarchilkov, a good friend who study naval architecture here. <strong>Our idea was to make more people aware of the constantly growing problems with the environment, especially the sea.</strong></p>
<p>We needed a kind of an ""eye"" able to explore and record the magnificence and the problems all around the world, so we can share it with you. After about two years of developing, changing from a solar powered vessel in different sizes, able to travel around the world without stop, <strong>we finally get in to the idea to build an autonomous sea drone</strong>, which is much more cost-effective and secure explorer (with no people on board), able to travel on top and underwater. <strong>And the best part of this solution is that you'll be able to buy one, so you can explore the sea yourself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Materials and technologies:</strong> The bigger part of the ""cake"" is for buying materials, parts and some custom technologies (for example, the solar ""sail/wing"" of the drone should be manufactured by third-party company, by our own custom design).</p>
<p><strong>2. Required instruments:</strong> We also need some advanced tools to help us with creating the body, mechanics and electronics.</p>
<p><strong>3. Engineering work:</strong> Includes the costs for professional engineers who will need to guide our team and to deal with the complicated tasks.</p>
<p><strong>4. Test, fixes and improvements: </strong>We realize that the prototype may not succeed from the first time. This is why we've planned some additional costs for dealing with eventual failures.</p>
<p>That's enough for what we need.<br/><u><strong>What you get for your help is more important for us...</strong></u></p>
<p>During the prototype developing process, we prepared a valuable reward for your help: donation certificates, recording your name on our ""wall of fame"", personal update notifications, basic or full access to the on-board monitoring platform and opportunity to invest. </p>
<p><strong>1. Contribution Certificate: </strong>Every perk provides you a personal donation certificate that we print and send via post, all over the world. And because helping us you help the sea and nature, we use natural materials to make it. Pictures will be available soon.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>FragraTest</b></p>
<p>Perfume is an essential element of style, a way of life, a kind of an indicator of social status since time immemorial. In the distant past only rich people could afford a nice aroma; nowadays, the opportunity to adorn ourselves with a fragrance is available to everyone. The choice of an individual flavor is very difficult and responsible process, since the right perfume for one person means self-confidence and attraction to others; in unity with the atmosphere, it promotes human beautification and the necessary entourage creation.</p>
<p>What Is It</p>
<p>✅ Our project ""Fragratest"" is an innovative tool in the beauty industry, the field of perfumery in particular. </p>
<p>Like any other industry, the production of perfumes requires technological development. Yes, new fragrances are emerging, new bottles design is developing, but the means of representing it to the consumer over the past few decades have not changed. </p>
<p>We offer a new, more sophisticated approach to the perfume creationspresentation - Fragratest, the essence of which relies on the basic laws of physics and chemistry. </p>
<p>The idea is that when you apply any perfume to the skin, the smell is FIRSTLYdistorted by the influence of body temperature, which directly depends on external stimuli in the form of the time of year and day. Fragratest minimizes these distortions already at the stage of choosing a perfume. By adjusting the temperature regime of the device, it is possible to evaluate objectively what will be the smell of the perfume in winter and summer, in the afternoon and in the evening.</p>
<p>How Does It Work</p>
<p>✅ Fragratest is a miniature accessory simulating the properties of human skin in different temperature states. </p>
<p>Fragratest can be regulated and operates in several thermal modes; the range is 34-40 Celsius Degrees. Due to this, the customer/buyer/owner, by choosing the perfume and wanting to know its exact aroma throughout the temperature spectrum, applies the perfume on the Fragratest, regulates the temperature and smells it. That is how he testes the fragrance and makes the most correct choice. </p>
<p>The package consists of a heating part that has the coronary structure, a thermostat, a thermostatic regulator, a carrier made of eco-leather and a power supply unit/battery (rechargeable/replaceable).</p>
<p>Skin, unlike paper, is capable to disclose the fragrance better and wider. Perfume has the real aroma on the skin while on paper it's a clean smell, which will never feel like when worn.</p>
<p>Who Is This For</p>
<p>✅ Fragratest can be used both individually and in perfume shops as an innovative alternative to blotter (disposable paper strip).</p>
<p>In the first case, the accessory serves as an assistant in selecting the most appropriate perfume before leaving home. In the second case, as already mentioned above, it is a new generation blotter. Therefore, users of this product are the brand/manufacturer, and the retailer/store. </p>
<p>Fragratest is a branded accessory, the design and size of which can vary depending on the wishes of the customer. </p>
<p>Fragratest Advantages</p>
<p>✅ Ecological aspect</p>
<p>Fragratest is a qualitative replacement for blotters, used in perfumery stores in huge quantity that from the point of view of ecology assumes constant deforestation. Fragratest is not a one-time item. With proper cleaning after applying the perfume, the object is sterile and reusable, unlike a disposable paper blotter. In the end, it is unreasonable to sniff a piece of paper, instead of enjoying oxygen that could have produced a tree that the blotter was made of.</p>
<p>✅ From the Marketing Point</p>
<p>Fragratest is a symbol of a new culture of conscious consumption.  </p>
<p>The modern world dictates rationality, an analytical approach to the choice. Fragratest, reducing the time for purchase deliberation, relieves doubts and the need to make choices on the basis of an incomprehensible smell coming from a piece of paper, lying in your pocket or at the bottom of the bag after shopping. This old-fashioned method of choosing perfume has already outlived itself.</p>
<p>The buyer's satisfaction is driven by the reasonableness of the purchase in his own eyes. Using Fragratest in the process of choosing a potential purchase completely involves the client; the work done by him and an individual approach add to the purchased product of unique value. Thanks to Fragratest, satisfied buyer = loyal customer.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our Founder invented the Bikers Guardians many years after having one of his motorcycles stolen from outside a fish &amp; Chip Shop in Matlock. He was only away from his motorcycle for about 10 minutes when two men loaded his motor cycle onto a van and drove off. Onlookers thought he had broken down never thinking that they had stolen his vehicle. He was distraught for many days and this planted the seed in his head regarding motorcycle security in town centers.</p>
<p>This is new prototype technology providing a multi parking solution to prevent the ever-increasing problems of motor cycle crime, both in the UK and globally.</p>
<h3>Our Global Challenge</h3>
<p>The rise of motorcycle crime has been widely publicized in recent years. Statistics gathered by the Highways Department indicate that there are over 1.8 million registered motorcycles and scooters on our highways today. Councils are doing their best to encourage more motor cyclists to bring their motor cycles in to the town and city centers as they ease congestion and also aid in the reduction of harmful emissions.</p>
<p>Consumers are also now far more concerned with the impact of stolen motor cycles as they are used for all kinds of crime such as snatch and grab, shop thefts, drug related crime and much more.</p>
<h3>Our Expertise</h3>
<p>SecuresIT Limited is an innovative new business which aims to take the Motor Cycle Security market by storm with its revolutionary device (BikersGuardians). Our team brings a combination of over 128 years of marketing, cybersecurity and international business and engineering expertise to this project.   We've successfully built products and service companies both in the US and UK.   The US based cybersecurity company involved in our project is a former INC 5000 awardee and recently listed as one of the top Cybersecurity companies to watch in Virginia for 2021.   </p>
<h3>Prototype Build</h3>
<p>We have selected and acquired a manufacturing company in the UK to work the integration and development of Biker's Guardian initial prototype.  Our figures are based on estimates from our detailed project requirement specifications from our engineering and cybersecurity experts.  We've implemented cost controls with our manufacturer to maintain our project to budget.  The budget includes cost of materials, integration labor and testing of the prototype. </p>
<p>Lastly, the primary outstanding risk to our project timeline is there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductor and microcontrollers; due to the manufacturing impacts of COVID 19 .  So we are tracking with our manufactures any fluctuations in cost and delivery time for these components.</p>
<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>The goal of our campaign is to raise  funding £87,230 to develop one unit prototype for this  new technology.  The prototype as shown in our video will be  providing a  multi parking solution to prevent the ever-increasing problems of motor cycle crime, both in the UK and globally.</p>

Onlookers thought he had broken down never thinking that they had stolen his vehicle. He was distraught for many days and this planted the seed in his head regarding motorcycle security in town centers.
This is new prototype technology providing a multi parking solution to prevent the ever-increasing problems of motor cycle crime, both in the UK and globally.
Our Global Challenge
The rise of motorcycle crime has been widely publicized in recent years. Statistics gathered by the Highways Department indicate that there are over 1.8 million registered motorcycles and scooters on our highways today. Councils are doing their best to encourage more motor cyclists to bring their motor cycles in to the town and city centers as they ease congestion and also aid in the reduction of harmful emissions.
Consumers are also now far more concerned with the impact of stolen motor cycles as they are used for all kinds of crime such as snatch and grab, shop thefts, drug related crime and much more.
Our Expertise
SecuresIT Limited is an innovative new business which aims to take the Motor Cycle Security market by storm with its revolutionary device (BikersGuardians). Our team brings a combination of over 128 years of marketing, cybersecurity and international business and engineering expertise to this project.   We've successfully built products and service companies both in the US and UK.   The US based cybersecurity company involved in our project is a former INC 5000 awardee and recently listed as one of the top Cybersecurity companies to watch in Virginia for 2021.   
Prototype Build
We have selected and acquired a manufacturing company in the UK to work the integration and development of Biker's Guardian initial prototype.  Our figures are based on estimates from our detailed project requirement specifications from our engineering and cybersecurity experts.  We've implemented cost controls with our manufacturer to maintain our project to budget.  The budget includes cost of materials, integration labor and testing of the prototype. 
Lastly, the primary outstanding risk to our project timeline is there is a worldwide shortage of semiconductor and microcontrollers; due to the manufacturing impacts of COVID 19 .  So we are tracking with our manufactures any fluctuations in cost and delivery time for these components.
We Need Your Help
The goal of our campaign is to raise  funding £87,230 to develop one unit prototype for this  new technology.  The prototype as shown in our video will be  providing a  multi parking solution to prevent the ever-increasing problems of motor cycle crime, both in the UK and globally.
We thank you for your support and  invite you to check out our website to learn more about Bikers Guardian features and feel free to share:

We appreciate  and are grateful for your time and hope you can support us helping provide a safe and green way for motorcyclist to secure their bikes.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What's eMag+?</h2>
<p>eMag+ is a cross-platform global digital magazine newsstand. It gives you all-you-can-read access to thousands digital magazines with a low monthly price.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487131366/aja3en40cuvjdcyi8gxh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">eMag+ is available to use on smartphone, tablet and computer. You can even save your favorite magazines and read them offline without using the internet.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Are We Doing This?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Approximately 80,000 to 160,000 trees are cut down daily worldwide. This estimate is based on the Global Forest Resource Assessment, most recently conducted in 2015, which estimates that Earth lost around 60,000 square kilometers of trees globally in one year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487706679/jk0djwociapn23ccj9jk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Every year, approximately 5,000,000,000 pages are printed for magazines. That’s caused more than 2,000,000 trees are killed every year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To save these trees and save the environment, eMag+ is designed to turn these printed magazines into digital magazines. The more people move to digital magazines, the more trees we can save.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How Does eMag+ Works?</h2>
<p>eMag+ is split into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>We all know Content Is King. So we have a self-publishing system for publishers to easily distribute their magazines to eMag+ for free based on a revenue share modal. That means publishers can easily upload the existing PDF files of their magazines to eMag+ to monetize and boost subscribers. This design ensures that we get excellent content for our readers.</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">The second part is the mobile app and web app, which allow readers to subscribe and read their favorite magazines on smartphone, tablet and computer. Currently we have already finished the iOS app, Android app and web app.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487049252/t4nby5b3k8puursujoat.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487829592/mn8cur3rtsj63k60zox5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

</div></div>","What's eMag+?
eMag+ is a cross-platform global digital magazine newsstand. It gives you all-you-can-read access to thousands digital magazines with a low monthly price.

eMag+ is available to use on smartphone, tablet and computer. You can even save your favorite magazines and read them offline without using the internet.

 
Why Are We Doing This?
Approximately 80,000 to 160,000 trees are cut down daily worldwide. This estimate is based on the Global Forest Resource Assessment, most recently conducted in 2015, which estimates that Earth lost around 60,000 square kilometers of trees globally in one year.

Every year, approximately 5,000,000,000 pages are printed for magazines. That’s caused more than 2,000,000 trees are killed every year.
To save these trees and save the environment, eMag+ is designed to turn these printed magazines into digital magazines. The more people move to digital magazines, the more trees we can save.

 
How Does eMag+ Works?
eMag+ is split into two parts:

We all know Content Is King. So we have a self-publishing system for publishers to easily distribute their magazines to eMag+ for free based on a revenue share modal. That means publishers can easily upload the existing PDF files of their magazines to eMag+ to monetize and boost subscribers. This design ensures that we get excellent content for our readers.
The second part is the mobile app and web app, which allow readers to subscribe and read their favorite magazines on smartphone, tablet and computer. Currently we have already finished the iOS app, Android app and web app.


 
All You Can Read
With a low monthly price ($7.99/month), you are able to subscribe ""eMag+ Premium"" plan and read as many current or past issues as you like.


The eMag+ Digital Newsstand creates a sustainable solution with a low monthly fee and unlimited access to thousands magazines. All you can read and read anywhere anytime. It is not only more convenient than print magazine, but also saving money.

 
Anywhere & Anytime
eMag+ redefine the reading experience for magazine readers. Users can even save their magazines and read them offline without using the internet, which is perfect for travelling!

Discover a new way to read your favorite magazines with eMag+. This design challenges the reading experience while also solving the common complications of magazine subscription.

 
Read, Comment & Share
Read and download as many magazines as you like. Anywhere. Anytime. Rate and comment your favorite magazines. Share your comments with your friends.

<h3>Our journey</h3>
<p>5 years ago, while perusing one of my many science based forums, I came across a disturbing article about the struggle for a safe and environmentally friendly way to dispose of used batteries. It turns out that even batteries that are recyclable contain at best only 10% recycled products, the rest is chucked into the landfills around the world.  And you say ""how bad can one little battery be?""  That's the equivalent of saying one snow flake never hurt anyone... The real problem is the massive number of them that corrode and decay each and everyday in our landfills - or worse - the unimaginable number that is simply thrown on the ground because there wasn't a garbage can near by at the time.  These all leach their deadly toxins into the ground and eventually poison our plants and animals and even our water supplies.  I decided there had to be a better way and with the help of my team, I present our solution:</p>

<p>The funds received will allow us to have molds made. Currently, we are building the lanterns using individual components which is very time consuming.  Certain key molds would result in a faster manufacturing process and thereby allow us to reduce our costs.</p>

<p>Lighting is a commodity item. Everyone uses it and needs it.

<p>Our goal is not only to market our lantern here in the USA but future production would make the lantern available to areas of the world that would most benefit from this long lasting technology.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How It Will Work</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Overview</i></strong></p>
<p>We want this small-scale tidal power generator to be as simple and compact as possible. The system will fit on the homeowner's dock or pier and will feature 2 cross-flow turbines (Banki turbines), gear transmission box, and batteries.</p>
<p>As water flows in or out, the turbines will turn the gears and produce DC current that will be stored in the batteries. That DC current will then be available to convert into AC current that can power the home.</p>
<p><b><i>Doing the math</i></b></p>
<p>Two turbines (42-inch in diameter, 4 feet deep) will be in the water at all times. They will spin for between 18-22 hours daily at a rate of 30 RPM (revolutions per minute). This high-torque, low-RPM rotation will be amplified into 300 RPMs through a gear transmission in watertight housing.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need to start thinking creatively about how to make clean energy accessible to individuals not only in our own country but also all around the world.</p>
<p>From observing the tides in my own backyard on the coast of Georgia, I estimate that useful power can be generated on an average of 20 hours per day.</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 50,000 homes on the east and west coasts of the United States that could benefit from this clean, safe energy source. And eventually, this could be used as a clean, affordable energy source all over the world.</p>
<h3><i>If this campaign is successful, I will be able to build and test a working prototype and make strides in making tidal power accessible to individuals.</i></h3>

<div><i>High and low tide on the marsh in my backyard. That's roughly a 10-foot difference 4 times a day, every day!</i></div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All of my calculations and plans are based on observations I’ve made with the tides in my own backyard on St. Simons Island, GA. The effectiveness of the generator may vary from place to place, based on several factors. The difference in tidal changes and water speed, for instance, could affect the amount of power that a home could generate.</p>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to raise enough funds to build a prototype and put it to the test. We want to make sure the testing period is long enough and thorough enough to diagnose problems, make improvements, and fine-tune the technology. Until we can build and test a prototype, we won't know how effective this home tidal power system will be.</p> <h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>

The Problem: Fragile Power Grid & Climate Crisis
The U.S. is the 3rd largest consumer of coal for generating electricity.  But our current power grid has a lot of problems:


Outdated and vulnerable to disruption: Every time a hurricane or severe storm hits, we expect--and even accept!--extensive power outages.

Inefficient sourcing: Fueling large power plants requires billions of tons of coal to be mined and transported before the power can be used

National security hazard: At any time a foreign enemy or a breakdown in the supply chain could create widespread power failure.

Pollution contributing to climate change: 83% of the CO2 emissions in the US are from generating electricity.

 

The UN’s 2018 report on climate change has spurred many to action to reduce waste and pollution in order to help mitigate the effects of years of environmental damage.
I believe there is a creative, positive answer to fighting climate change: investing in renewable energy.

As water flows in or out, the turbines will turn the gears and produce DC current that will be stored in the batteries. That DC current will then be available to convert into AC current that can power the home.
Doing the math
Two turbines (42-inch in diameter, 4 feet deep) will be in the water at all times. They will spin for between 18-22 hours daily at a rate of 30 RPM (revolutions per minute). This high-torque, low-RPM rotation will be amplified into 300 RPMs through a gear transmission in watertight housing.

Initial renderings of the home tidal power system

The gearbox will power a generator that feeds power into an array of high-capacity batteries. A radium controller will help convert the DC power into AC power. This power could be directly wired into your home's power system or used as auxiliary power.
 

 


The prototype will use many preexisting components, but we will also make some custom components ourselves.

The fact that you’ve read this far proves that you care about protecting the environment and making a difference in the face of climate change.
 
By supporting this project, you could participate in making progress in attainable renewable energy solutions.
 
Generate power, generate awareness. Let's do this together!
 

 
The Perks: What You Get
When you donate at any amount, you are joining a community of people who believe that real change begins at the individual level. 
If we reach our campaign goal of $50,000, you will receive a thank you gift per your giving amount:


$25: Moving Water Company decal

$50: Moving Water Company hat

$50: Moving Water Company t-shirt

$100: Private video interview with Hamp Stevens

$200: Super Donor Pack

$500: Your name on a generator

OR if you choose to bypass a perk and/or want to give a custom amount, you can simply hit the pink ""Back It"" button at the top of the campaign page.
Whatever your giving amount, we'll add your name to the Donor Hall of Fame on our website (with your permission). Once you donate, just email us at hamp@water2power.com to let us know if you'd like to be added!
If the campaign does not reach $50,000, however, your donation will be refunded to you by Indiegogo, which means we would not be able to fulfill perks.
 
The Impact
We need to start thinking creatively about how to make clean energy accessible to individuals not only in our own country but also all around the world.
From observing the tides in my own backyard on the coast of Georgia, I estimate that useful power can be generated on an average of 20 hours per day.
Currently, there are about 50,000 homes on the east and west coasts of the United States that could benefit from this clean, safe energy source. And eventually, this could be used as a clean, affordable energy source all over the world.
If this campaign is successful, I will be able to build and test a working prototype and make strides in making tidal power accessible to individuals.
  Tidal changes in my backyard.
 

High and low tide on the marsh in my backyard. That's roughly a 10-foot difference 4 times a day, every day!
 
Risks & Challenges
All of my calculations and plans are based on observations I’ve made with the tides in my own backyard on St. Simons Island, GA. The effectiveness of the generator may vary from place to place, based on several factors. The difference in tidal changes and water speed, for instance, could affect the amount of power that a home could generate.
Our goal with this campaign is to raise enough funds to build a prototype and put it to the test. We want to make sure the testing period is long enough and thorough enough to diagnose problems, make improvements, and fine-tune the technology. Until we can build and test a prototype, we won't know how effective this home tidal power system will be. Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren’t able to contribute financially, you can still help turn this idea into a working prototype. Here’s what you can do:

Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and here on Indiegogo.
Share this campaign with your friends and family.

It’s that simple to make a difference! Thank you!

<h3>Everything started in a kitchen</h3>
<p>Denise &amp; Jean-Michel - an American mom and a Swiss architect - moved to Arizona. Our first concerns were how to find fresh, healthy food and how to get our children to participate more in our household activities. Gardening seemed to be the logical answer. Our question was, how do we make it easier, more productive, and beautiful?</p>
<p>HomY is the result. By connecting a greenhouse to a kid-friendly kitchen it is simple to control the produce quality and be involved in delivering <strong>living food from the ground to the table</strong>.</p>
<p>The benefits of the HomY ePlans don't only extend to energizing your body or teaching your children. HomY gives you a good, abundant life. </p>

<h3>Why does a good life begin with a new plan?</h3>
<p>You won't find this kind of house on the market, <strong> you must build it.</strong></p>

<p>HomY is also ready to go off-grid!</p>

<p>Need even more bedrooms? Transform the second-floor panoramic terrace (250 sqft/25 m2) into additional rooms. The sky is the limit, just do it! </p>
<p><strong>A homeschooling family</strong></p>
<p>This is a great the place to teach the next generation on a better way of life; respect for our resources, gardening, etc. HomY is especially designed to be kid-friendly so they can assist, learn and discover in both the kitchen and the greenhouse.</p>

Among us there are designers, artists, photographers, businessmen, programmers and engineers. Travel plays a major role in all of our lives, and powerbanks have long since been the go to for our on the road power needs.

The goal was to create a energizing bag that didn’t turn its carrier into a robot due to unnecessary additions. We chose natural materials and a slightly rough design for a casual feel.

Without creating, changing, developing and inspiring. Without a movement, innovatons and optimization - no interruptions by low battery needed. Without facing freedom - no limits - only comfort, even when getting out of your comfort zone.This project stemmed from an idea my friends and I conceived several years ago. Among us there are designers, artists, photographers, businessmen, programmers and engineers. Travel plays a major role in all of our lives, and powerbanks have long since been the go to for our on the road power needs. It has always been a goal to somehow incorporate style, into the functionality of a powerbank. We tested numerous solutions on trips, however did not find the solution we were looking for. We decided to try to make a dream bag, a lifeline for traveling.We took into consideration the flaws that powerbanks have, as well as how to seamlessly integrate them into a convenient bag design, from which point it took us a year to develop and establish the possibility of production.And so, we present the first product in the line of battery/ bag hybrids under the brand LONGWALK.  When designing the bag, we specifically aimed to minimize any negative aspects that could arise. The goal was to create a energizing bag that didn’t turn its carrier into a robot due to unnecessary additions. We chose natural materials and a slightly rough design for a casual feel. The bags dimensions are 28x18x8cm; this allows it to be unobtrusive during long walks or trips, and at the same time large enough to accommodate all the necessary gadgets and essentials (phone / keys / wallet and other traveling necessities). The LONGWALK Bags have a tracker and you always can to find your LONGWALK. Our production of bags is based in Europe, while power banks are developed in Hong Kong.Our first production design was sewed in one color, but we have since developed a whole color range, which we want to implement based on the results of crowdfunding campaigns, within which we will offer the option vote for certain colors and configurations.As for the electric aspect of the charging bag, we found a very interesting solution that exists on the market and tailored it to suit the needs of the project.

<p>“Facts not fiction” the contamination of the groundwater, the massive earthquakes to states that should never experience a quake, water waste usage in drought conditions, these are all proven to be dangers of “fracking methods.” These are just a few of the dangers. Finally there is a remedy; my product is more eco-friendly, single pipe hydraulic fracking system, uses no water and no chemicals, and has a patented vacuum pump. This system is also safer and less costly. My father always told me “keep it simple stupid” a phrase I am sure you have heard before. So imagine that your using a leaf blower for some fall cleaning, not getting anywhere with the leaves blowing around, but bring in a vacuum and all the leaves are sucked up and now you’re done with your yard work. Remember the movie Erin Brokovich, well she went up against the corporate world and found the truth, we can too!</p>
<p> To start, let me give you a bit of background about hydraulic fracturing. Fracking is an extraction technique for oil and gas wells in which rocks are fractured artificially with the use of pressurized liquid. This technique dates as far back as the 1860’s. When this now full grown monster first started out they used nitro-glycerin and dynamite as their main technique. The current oil fracking method is chemicals in the water and explosions that leak into the aquifer, because you have 50,000 pounds pushing along existing pipes that went through soft dirt and shale. This is their so called safe method. So basically due to that 50k pounds pushing and making the pipes crack, those entire chemicals move down into our aquifer, therefore contaminating the groundwater.</p>
<p>My mother used to tell me a saying “Dennis there are three parts to every story, yours, mine, and the truth.” Well I am going to explain the truths to the dangers of these methods companies have been using to extract oil. Just like the pharmaceutical companies, they want us to take there drugs while minimizing the risks and side effects, hydraulic fracturing is just the same in that aspect. They would too like to minimize the dangers while convincing us to continue using it.  </p>
<p>The first danger I came across is the rise in earthquakes, Oklahoma averaged 2 quakes measuring over a 3.0 on the Richter scale per year, midway through 2014 a registered 230 earthquakes had occured. Disposing fracking fluid into the wells is what is causing these earthquakes. Next, the main topic talked about within this controversial subject is contamination of the groundwater. Water can be contaminated through a spill occurring, something within the system not being built properly, whether or not the fracking fluid is able to escape the formation that they are working on. The other contamination is air pollution. During the transport of the oil and gas, pollutants are released, pollutants such as benzene a cancer causing chemical.</p>
<p>Finally, we have come to the part of hope, we at The Inventors Depot have come up with a product , called eco-fracking; it is a single pipe hydraulic fracking system that uses a sealed vacuum pump, no harmful chemicals, in fact no chemicals at all. This revolutionary system also uses no water. So we would not be affecting the drought conditions in certain areas like the current method does today. We have designed a simple method system to draw the resources up from the ground using our patented sealed vacuum pump and special auger. An auger is basically a tool to make holes in something resembling a cork screw. As we are drawing those resources up from the wells our vacuum pump is filtering and condensing all the particles and fumes safely. Ensuring that there are no fumes or smells within proximity of the well and your homes. Our goal is not to stop fracking all together, but to build a better way! We want to do this by using a safer and less expensive method for extracting oil. We hope also that the oil industry will see the many benefits in our system and adapt them for their own. We are a non-profit group, who will use the proceeds that are donated towards this product being manufactured and sent into the market.  Every family living near a fracking site will greatly benefit from this product. We will also be implementing an agency to certify all and any companies that would like to use our product and method in the future, to ensure that it stays the way it was originally intended. This all started with the legendary Paul Neal “Red” Adair teaming up with Ed”Coots” and Asger”Boots” in the 50’s, between 8 oil experts who have helped us with this project and there 300 years combined of experience in the fracking field, I personally feel very confident in our product. We urge you to join our cause, any donations help we are looking for a minimum of 30k to get this onto the shelves. We are just a small group of inventors with some very large dreams and products. You can see our other products we are working on at our website:</p>

(said Jacques Cousteau)​</u></i></strong></p>
<p>       <strong>""Water Electrodialysis""</strong> - this is a simple, modular, fully autonomous and innovative process unit for turning salty sea water into clean drinking water; it does not depend on external sources of energy, since solar panels and a diesel generator - on board.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">     <u><strong> Delivered, installed - and after 60 min we get clean water!​ </strong></u>        </p>

<p>       It's hard to imagine life on Earth without water. Water reserves in the world are enormous. They make up about 1.5 billion km3, and this is - 0.025% of the total mass of the Earth. However, the vast majority of this enormous mass - regrettably - salt water, unfit for drinking and technological uses of. The mass of fresh water - not more than 2% of its total quantity water. The main volume, about 96% of fresh water, is concentrated in the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland and the Antarctic, in mountain glaciers, icebergs and permafrost. Only about 1% of the total amount of fresh water is in the liquid state. This is - the rivers, freshwater lakes, part of the groundwater. It is this water is used by mankind and the animal world for their many needs.</p>
<p>       To date, the state of rivers is a major concern. For example; third of small rivers have dried up. Most of these rivers are degraded and no doubt will lead to degradation of large rivers.        </p>
<p>        <strong> There is a desperate need for a safe, more reliable way to sea water desalination. We need a solution that allows people to turning salty sea water into clean drinking water.</strong></p>
<p>       Scientists have proved that each person simply need min 12 liters of fresh water per day, including - to 3 liters for drinking. Today, in many countries there is no such amount of water. From the thirst of hundreds of thousands of people are dying, including children’s.</p>
<p>        According to the UN: - consumption of fresh water in the world has doubled in the last 50 years. The expected sharp increase in population, which numbered in the next 50 years will reach 8 billion people, and is a problem not only to provide food, but also to ensure the water - at least minimally suitable for consumption.</p>
<p>      <strong> ""Water Electrodialysis"" - is the solution.</strong></p>
<p>       We have developed a groundbreaking technology that harnesses the power of sunlight to turning salty sea water into clean drinking water.</p>
<p>       <strong>""Water Electrodialysis""</strong> is affordable, sustainably produced, and effective at turning salty sea water into clean drinking water without depending on infrastructure. By giving individuals the ability to easily clean the water they have on the seashore with only solar energy.</p>
<p>       In essence, <strong>""Water Electrodialysis""</strong> does more than provide clean water, it empowers.</p>
<h3 align=""center"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     <u><i><strong>""We come to know the value of water, only when the well dries up completely."" (said Benjamin Franklin)​</strong></i></u></p>
<p>       As has always been in our world, a man follows the path of least resistance without thinking about their future and the future of their children and grandchildren, about the fate of those who are already dying of thirst. Nothing but disasters cannot force a person to treat the water carefully.</p>
<p>       <strong>Water - it the subject of a bid.</strong></p>

<p>           The <strong>""Water Electrodialysis""</strong> device functions independently of infrastructure. Unlike reverse osmosis devices that rely on the constant replacement of expensive filters, our device can function on (provided - just - regular maintenance) for over a decade.</p>

<p><strong>Consequently:</strong></p>
<p>       <i><strong>At First</strong></i>, Given the trend of increasing freshwater consumption on the one hand and a sharp reduction in its quantity, on the other, which stimulates the movement of environmental scientists to develop the most effective methods of purification and desalination, which are most suitable for use in the household and in the household service sector.</p>
<p>       Electrodialysis desalination, in this sense, the most promising.</p>
<p>       And We are more than sure that the cost the membranes for electrodialysis, ie ion-selective, membranes can also be reduced, because the main component of the membrane - is the ion-exchange resin, whose production is connected with the processing of natural gas.        </p>
<p>       <i><strong>Secondly;</strong></i> All known methods of water desalination have little flexibility or, in other words, limited area applications. Unlike electrodialysis where parallel desalting process occurs producing hydrogen and oxygen as byproducts and the formation of acids and alkalis. Common sense suggests that these properties electrodialyzers give additional advantages of using electrodialyzers.</p>
<p>       <i><strong>Thirdly;</strong></i> Electrodialysis desalination water installation even in its principle of operation are it is flow straight-through, ie do not require pumping equipment high pressure (as such as in reverse osmosis) what, not least, to automate the process for safety reasons and does not require the use of complex devices.</p>
<p>       <strong>Our next important innovative development will be the creation <u>(<i>on the basis of ""Water Electrodialysis""</i>)</u> of installations for the complex cleaning of ""filterable wastewater"", which are formed on landfills for the disposal of food and household waste (garbage dumps); together with deironing and demanganization facilities.</strong></p>

<p><u><strong>Besides;</strong></u></p>
<p>       <strong>""Water Electrodialysis""</strong> can be used both independently and together with other cleaning methods.</p>
<p>       1) First of all, for cleaning ""mine water"" and other industrial wastewater; together with deironing and demanganization facilities.</p>
<p>       2) Together with ion-exchange resins - to produce extremely pure water, in quality not inferior to distilled water.</p>
<p>       3) To obtain ""live"" and ""dead"" water without the use of reagents.</p>
<p>       4) To obtain ""pure"" salts, primarily sea salt.</p>

<p>Desalination of sea water by desalination plants based on electrodialysis - which we have perfected <i><u><strong>(see our patent ""UA 106302 U"")</strong></u></i> - the most promising way.</p>
<p><u><strong>And more - important:</strong></u></p>
<p>       We have many pay much attention to the issue of the structure of water.</p>
<p>       It is known that the desalination of water, violated the structure of water. Rather; after removal salts from of water, water is formed with a special structure which is very different from the structure of natural fresh water. In nature (as far as known to science), water structure is formed over the years, when in contact with various minerals.</p>
<p>       Especially important minerals that are involved in the formation of water structures are silicon-containing minerals: quartz sand, rock crystal, zeolites.</p>

drinking water there - where, it is
impossible for Others
 
""Water Electrodialysis"" - gives life.  
""Us - the inhabitants of the earth - can be compared with the passengers of the ship, which is given certain water supply. But this ship passenger can expect that in case of shortage of water, some other ship can help them; while we are alone in the universe, completely alone, with our small supply of water - so necessary for life."" (said Jacques Cousteau)​
       ""Water Electrodialysis"" - this is a simple, modular, fully autonomous and innovative process unit for turning salty sea water into clean drinking water; it does not depend on external sources of energy, since solar panels and a diesel generator - on board.
      Delivered, installed - and after 60 min we get clean water!​         
                
       
       It's hard to imagine life on Earth without water. Water reserves in the world are enormous. They make up about 1.5 billion km3, and this is - 0.025% of the total mass of the Earth. However, the vast majority of this enormous mass - regrettably - salt water, unfit for drinking and technological uses of. The mass of fresh water - not more than 2% of its total quantity water. The main volume, about 96% of fresh water, is concentrated in the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland and the Antarctic, in mountain glaciers, icebergs and permafrost. Only about 1% of the total amount of fresh water is in the liquid state. This is - the rivers, freshwater lakes, part of the groundwater. It is this water is used by mankind and the animal world for their many needs.
       To date, the state of rivers is a major concern. For example; third of small rivers have dried up. Most of these rivers are degraded and no doubt will lead to degradation of large rivers.        
         There is a desperate need for a safe, more reliable way to sea water desalination. We need a solution that allows people to turning salty sea water into clean drinking water.
       Scientists have proved that each person simply need min 12 liters of fresh water per day, including - to 3 liters for drinking. Today, in many countries there is no such amount of water. From the thirst of hundreds of thousands of people are dying, including children’s.
        According to the UN: - consumption of fresh water in the world has doubled in the last 50 years. The expected sharp increase in population, which numbered in the next 50 years will reach 8 billion people, and is a problem not only to provide food, but also to ensure the water - at least minimally suitable for consumption.
       ""Water Electrodialysis"" - is the solution.
       We have developed a groundbreaking technology that harnesses the power of sunlight to turning salty sea water into clean drinking water.
       ""Water Electrodialysis"" is affordable, sustainably produced, and effective at turning salty sea water into clean drinking water without depending on infrastructure. By giving individuals the ability to easily clean the water they have on the seashore with only solar energy.
       In essence, ""Water Electrodialysis"" does more than provide clean water, it empowers.
What We Need & What You Get
     ""We come to know the value of water, only when the well dries up completely."" (said Benjamin Franklin)​
       As has always been in our world, a man follows the path of least resistance without thinking about their future and the future of their children and grandchildren, about the fate of those who are already dying of thirst. Nothing but disasters cannot force a person to treat the water carefully.
       Water - it the subject of a bid.
       Sooner or later, but somebody start the war over water resources.      
       Even in towns and villages located on the banks of rivers and lakes, there is already a shortage of fresh water.
      And what about those who live on the seaside, away from large infrastructure ... who wants to develop picturesque and ecological sites, build houses, cottages, mini hotels and boarding houses and etc. on the coast of the oceans ...?
Where it is very expensive to pull (through jungles, mountains or deserts) power lines and water pipes or drill very expensive deep wells - ""Water Electrodialysis"" is just NECESSARY!
      Our option - we suggest using water, but not drinking water.
      This is - sea water.
      It seems an incredible amount of sea water reserves - enough to live thousands of years. However, the production of fresh water from sea water is not such a simple problem.

People can conserve the time, money, and energy that they would have used trying to desalinate sea water, and instead focus on long-term goals such as healthcare, education, and agriculture.
           The ""Water Electrodialysis"" device functions independently of infrastructure. Unlike reverse osmosis devices that rely on the constant replacement of expensive filters, our device can function on (provided - just - regular maintenance) for over a decade.

Consequently:
       At First, Given the trend of increasing freshwater consumption on the one hand and a sharp reduction in its quantity, on the other, which stimulates the movement of environmental scientists to develop the most effective methods of purification and desalination, which are most suitable for use in the household and in the household service sector.
       Electrodialysis desalination, in this sense, the most promising.
       And We are more than sure that the cost the membranes for electrodialysis, ie ion-selective, membranes can also be reduced, because the main component of the membrane - is the ion-exchange resin, whose production is connected with the processing of natural gas.        
       Secondly; All known methods of water desalination have little flexibility or, in other words, limited area applications. Unlike electrodialysis where parallel desalting process occurs producing hydrogen and oxygen as byproducts and the formation of acids and alkalis. Common sense suggests that these properties electrodialyzers give additional advantages of using electrodialyzers.
       Thirdly; Electrodialysis desalination water installation even in its principle of operation are it is flow straight-through, ie do not require pumping equipment high pressure (as such as in reverse osmosis) what, not least, to automate the process for safety reasons and does not require the use of complex devices.
       Our next important innovative development will be the creation (on the basis of ""Water Electrodialysis"") of installations for the complex cleaning of ""filterable wastewater"", which are formed on landfills for the disposal of food and household waste (garbage dumps); together with deironing and demanganization facilities.
This is a HUGE and COMPLEX PROBLEM!​

It applies to all countries of the World!​

Besides;
       ""Water Electrodialysis"" can be used both independently and together with other cleaning methods.
       1) First of all, for cleaning ""mine water"" and other industrial wastewater; together with deironing and demanganization facilities.
       2) Together with ion-exchange resins - to produce extremely pure water, in quality not inferior to distilled water.
       3) To obtain ""live"" and ""dead"" water without the use of reagents.
       4) To obtain ""pure"" salts, primarily sea salt.
       5) To produce hydrogen and oxygen as a by-product.
And so on.
Therefore:
Desalination of sea water by desalination plants based on electrodialysis - which we have perfected (see our patent ""UA 106302 U"") - the most promising way.
And more - important:
       We have many pay much attention to the issue of the structure of water.
       It is known that the desalination of water, violated the structure of water. Rather; after removal salts from of water, water is formed with a special structure which is very different from the structure of natural fresh water. In nature (as far as known to science), water structure is formed over the years, when in contact with various minerals.
       Especially important minerals that are involved in the formation of water structures are silicon-containing minerals: quartz sand, rock crystal, zeolites.
Therefore, in our future work, we are going to give due attention to this issue - the issue of the formation of the structure of desalinated water.Who We Are       ""Water Electrodialysis"" is an international team of scientists-practices, inventor engineers and entrepreneurial economists who seek to supply drinking water to many thirsty people and children who suffer and even die from the lack of ""clean fresh water"".       We have come together around the common belief that we can cheaply and sustainably change the lives of millions of people around the world, using - as the ""Engine of Progress"" - almost unlimited, natural and - Most importantly - renewable natural resources: sea water and the power of sunlight.       The original concept for the device was developed through a course at at the intersection of scientific disciplines: the science of electric welding and the science of water.       ""The heart"" of our desalination installations - ""Electrodializator flat"" (see our patent ""UA 106302 U"") - was patented by our team in April 2015.        I.e; ""Water Electrodialysis"" is based on our original invention.        The original ideas were confirmed by extensive additional studies carried out to establish the scientific reliability of the device, identify target markets and establish links with industry experts. Thanks to the continued, generous support of patrons, ""Water Electrodialysis"" has moved towards commercialization.       ""Water Electrodialysis"" has also participated in the Rutgers I-Corps program and conducting customer discovery interviews which provided many insights regarding the need for technologies of desalination of sea water.       ""Water Electrodialysis"" actively participates in the Movement ""Fresh Water - for Everyone!"", using all the power of its energy to provide fresh water 10 and more million lives by 2025 to transform the lives of these people. We are competing in the international Hult Prize competition with other social entrepreneurs from all over the world, vying for the coveted $1-million-dollar prize.       So, why are we the right people for this job?       ""Water Electrodialysis"" - international team of scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs with diverse talents, backgrounds, and expertise.   Oleksandr Kalmykov - General Manager of the company (Poland); Experienced participant and head of large hydrotechnical projects and team management; Practical engineer, prospector, experimenter and rationalizer.       Master; graduated in 1993 from the Ukrainian National University of Water Management and Nature Management, specialty - Engineer Hydrotechnician       Since 1984, he took an active part in the construction, installation of equipment, overhaul of many hydroelectric power stations, hydro-accumulating power plants, nuclear power plants and other hydraulic structures.

This device, that is our BBS, stays attached to the fridge door and will allow you to update constantly. In fact, thanks to its built-in accelerometer, the BBS will turn-on automatically every time the fridge door opens, asking if you've added or taken any item. </p>
<p>Technically, the built-in laser scanner allows you to scan any barcode, in any light condition, in a faster and more reliable way than the camera of any smart-phone.  </p>
