Short Summary

Country Strike is a country-rock band from Zagreb/Croatia, active since 2011.. Leading the band's resume are two awards from ""Texas Sounds International Country Music Awards"" in Jefferson/Texas/USA in 2015.: the grand prix - ""Entertainer of the year"" and ""Personality of the year"" in competition with 30 acts from around the world and this was made possible by contributors to our Indiegogo campaign last year for which we are veeeery grateful to all who helped out! The experience gave the band a big push, put us and country music on the map in Croatia as well as enabling us to record our first official release this year!


It was a trip into the unknown which makes the story even better but this year we have been nominated again and want to go all out and make the most of it and give you the whole experience to share by recording The first Croatian LIVE country music album with multimedia content from the trip to Texas. We are blessed to be given this opportunity to do something special and we want all of you who contribute to our cause to be the first to share it with us!  We want to give you, as much music and content as we can and in this case a chance to get the feeling of Texas and it's music, people, scenery.... as we experienced it.

   What We Need & What You Get
We are not looking for handouts, we need a helping hand over a big step on our way up!
**Remember, anything that is available through the perks is exclusive to the campaign. None of the items will ever be printed again in this way.**

All contributors will receive their purchased perks and our gratitude for believing in us and if the money gathered will not be enough or if anything else stops our project the funds will be put into making new material and recording as well as pushing us along even further!

</p><p>I have been writing
songs since I was a young child. I am a mother, artist and poet as well as a
singer and writer of songs. My songs are about pain and dreams, the psyche and
the earth, living off grid and troubled inner and outer worlds. About healing or repairing ourselves
before we can heal the world. Some are kinda funny (though often in a dark sort
of way) and some are quite serious (and even darker...but there is light too!)
Maybe I could start a new genre of music named ""Deep, Dark, Psychological
Nature Folk"" :)? But for now I’ll say
its alternative folk!<br/>
<br/>
I live off-grid in this gorgeous little valley in Aberdeenshire (the North East
of Scotland) where my family and I have planted thousands of trees and are
building natural dwellings among them. I grow my own vegetables, home-educate
my two children (who are now fairly self-educating at 15 and 18) and my partner
and I paint for a living. I have sung and written songs from an early age and have always wanted to sing more professionally and have my words heard by a larger audience and if I could also make a little money from my music, it
would please me so much, but I will do it anyway just for the love of it! <br/>
<br/>
I have played a lot at parties and folk clubs/open mic’s and done a few small
gigs with friends and family but now want to start gigging more professionally
and would like to make this EP to sell at gigs and market online. I have thirty
plus songs I would like to record eventually and would like to make lyric and art
books and other hand printed merchandise, but I won't get too carried away just
yet and will start small with this EP:)<br/>
<br/>
I have just got a band together who seem to be enthusiastic about gigging with
me which is exciting! A bass player/guitarist (my partner!), a banjo player and
a drummer and genbre player. We are practicing hard ready for our first gig. <br/>
<br/>
I have mucked around with recording myself and my attempts can be heard on Sound
Cloud and YouTube, but to sell them I need a more professional sound as I don't
really know what I'm doing with recording and would rather put my time into
song writing, practice and performance, rather than learning to become a sound
engineer!<br/>
<br/>
I have been quoted £520 by a recording studio to record and mix 4 songs, £360
to make 200 CD's and £20 to print some lyric books so I'll start with that. If I don't reach my target I will put what money I do make towards some basic recording equipment and beg my musical friends to help me with recording!<br/>
<br/>
It's hard to keep confidence levels up, but I do believe my music is relevant
and worth getting out there.  song writing for me has always been a way of processing emotional events and its my hope that some of the themes will speak to people going through their own troubles, writing them is definitely a kind of therapy and I have often turned to the songs and music of others in times of need and been lifted by poetic and meaningful lyrics, beats and melodies. Its also just possible that my lyrics will make people think and question the things 
which are wrong in the world and in themselves...maybe I am being a 
little misguided there, but you never know ;)...So I am pushing through the wall of self-doubt and
going for it. If people donated to this campaign or even just said nice
(or constructively critical) things and shared it around with their friends, so it can be seen by as many people as
possible, it would give me such a delightful kick, you wouldn't believe it! <br/>
<br/>
Here is what a lovely person said about my songs once :)<br/>
<br/>
""Rachel's songs are sometimes raw, personal, honest, dark and visceral and
sometimes dreamy, ethereal and quirky"". <br/>
<br/>
I thank the friends, family and the occasional stranger, very much, who have encouraged and supported me
to this point and allowed me to believe my songs and voice are worth being heard. All
your nice little comments/compliments have led to this. If you are able to give
to, or share my project I will love you forever and send all the good thoughts
I am capable of your way!!! Thank you SO SO much in advance!! </p>

and worth getting out there.  song writing for me has always been a way of processing emotional events and its my hope that some of the themes will speak to people going through their own troubles, writing them is definitely a kind of therapy and I have often turned to the songs and music of others in times of need and been lifted by poetic and meaningful lyrics, beats and melodies. Its also just possible that my lyrics will make people think and question the things 
which are wrong in the world and in themselves...maybe I am being a 
little misguided there, but you never know ;)...So I am pushing through the wall of self-doubt and
going for it. If people donated to this campaign or even just said nice
(or constructively critical) things and shared it around with their friends, so it can be seen by as many people as
possible, it would give me such a delightful kick, you wouldn't believe it! 

Here is what a lovely person said about my songs once :)

""Rachel's songs are sometimes raw, personal, honest, dark and visceral and
sometimes dreamy, ethereal and quirky"". 

I thank the friends, family and the occasional stranger, very much, who have encouraged and supported me
to this point and allowed me to believe my songs and voice are worth being heard. All
your nice little comments/compliments have led to this. If you are able to give
to, or share my project I will love you forever and send all the good thoughts
I am capable of your way!!! Thank you SO SO much in advance!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","hi friends we are all a part of the grand shell game. we have made an album. composed of six songs. 
we came together haphazardly. we made some noise and it was good. we became a band. we recorded in Connecticut. we played up and down the east coast. we got to know our home town of Carrboro, NC. we recorded a bit there too. we holed up for the better part of a year rehearsing and really got to know each other. and now here we are. we think it's a record.
we are ready to introduce you to our baby. precocious and coy with a grandeur heartbeat. say hello to the man on a wire.
   ... we have 4000 reasons to raise some dough miles. we're talking miles. we're coming to see you in our trusty bus, the starship moneypenny. by our meticulous ballpark calculations this means we'll travel 4000 miles on our journey through (at this point) 19 stops and 20 gigs in 25 days on the east coast. 



(the starship moneypenny)

at the reasonable rate ~ for a bus ~ of 15 miles per gallon with gas at a conservative $2.50 per gallon this means we'll spend $666OHMYGODAAAAAAAAAHHHH. 
actually $666.66666666666668 to be exactish. a somewhat hefty sum.


but... that's not ten grand.you're right. and we're not exactly sure what hitting the goal gets us on this indiegogo platform, maybe we're just missing it in the faq. but we appreciate the community here and we like the idea of having a goal. it implies that we really want to get the word out about this album, because we do. 
we would love it if you were to spread the word. we're sort of putting our money where our mouth is. the approximate cost of producing this thing was ten thousand dollars. the sooner we can recoup that cost, the sooner we as a band turn a profit with our art, which would be amazing. and the more people that learn about this campaign learn about us, which might mean we get more folks at shows. it's a win-win.

whether we make $50 or fifty grand, we get to keep these funds. you will get what you order and you are helping us grow. ten grand is a lot of dough, we know. we set the bar kind of high. but it can go a long way for a small band like us. we tried to price things fairly and we had some fun with some of the package items to make them really worth the while. 



speaking of stuff. and things. what can you get?
we have the album. currently in cd format.

digital downloads too. t-shirts. music lessons. shirtless bacon frying, dinner for four, weekday gigs, weekend gigs, and a rockstar package. sort of like Spinal Tap. but better. 

plus our eternal gratitude.

all these things and more can be yours for a reasonable price. on or after June 11th. and with your contribution we will send you a digital version of the gateway to the album, the title track ""man on a wire"" for that immediate gratification.

  what sort of risks and challenges await us? fear. and loathing.
thus far it appears we've overcome everything else...

    of course, if you're broke... don't worry about it. we get it. maybe check out a friends' copy for a while until you get some dough and buy it from us later. just support us. come to the shows. keep in touch. and of course, tell your friends. if you dig, share this on facebook, twitter, instagram, IRC, ICQ, AOL, ACRONYM, the public events board at the grocery, wherever. anywhere good people might congregate. and thank you.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Sobre Wiñay Wayna</strong></p>
<p><br/>Wiñay Wayna, es una palabra que esta escrita en Quechua y que significa “por siempre joven” en Castellano, es una empresa social conformada por jóvenes de Perú, Colombia y Francia. Hace un año, estos jóvenes vienen apostando por el emprendimiento social en Latinoamérica,  ayudando en la formación de proyectos sociales de diferentes rubros, teniendo como actores clave a jóvenes de las diferentes ciudades del Perú, para que estos puedan revelar su potencial y talento, y puedan ponerlo al servicio de la sociedad.</p>
<p><strong>Wayna Tour Febrero 2017</strong></p>
<p><u>""Tour de Emprendimiento Social""</u></p>
<p>El emprendimiento social es un camino que los peruanos necesitan tomar en cuenta para poder lograr un cambio positivo en la sociedad. A través de diversas fuentes, hemos encontrado que existen muchas personas con ganas de generar impacto social sostenible, pero tienen muchas barreras para conseguirlo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muy pocos pueden hacer realidad sus ideas de impacto social, principalmente porque no existen espacios para conversar y conocer las experiencias de un emprendedor social exitoso.</li>
<li>Hay muchas personas con un alto potencial, pero muchos no creen en ellos mismos, lo cual genera que muchos emprendedores se caigan en el camino. Conocerse a uno mismo es la base de un emprendimiento.</li>
<li>Hace falta que los emprendedores sepan estructurar sus proyectos. Al no existir una cultura del emprendimiento, las personas no saben cómo crecer y lograr sostenibilidad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>¿Cómo aporta este proyecto?</strong></p>
<p>En este primer año como empresa, hemos podido impactar directamente a más de 55 jóvenes de entre 19 a 34 años, de más de 10 ciudades de Perú, en tres tours de emprendimiento social. Trabajamos bajo el programa pedagógico innovador: la “metodología 3i”: inspiración, introspección e innovación.</p>
<p>Durante este viaje transformacional, los participantes experimentan este método, el cual acompaña a los participantes en el proceso de formación de su proyecto y en el reconocimiento de su pasión y de las problemáticas sociales que quiere y puede resolver. Esta experiencia potencializa el desarrollo óptimo de su creatividad, talento, autoestima, autoconfianza e identidad ciudadana.</p>
<p><strong>¿Que se hemos alcanzado hasta ahora?</strong></p>
<ul><li>Mentoría a más de 120 jóvenes con proyectos sociales escalables.</li></ul>
<p>Formación a más de 15 proyectos sociales de alto impacto actualmente en marcha. Todos sus creadores han sido parte del Wayna Tour.</p>
<ul>
<li>Orientación a proyectos sociales de alta escalabilidad. Ejemplos: el proyecto “EcoBaf” ha recibido el acojo de inversionistas de alto rango, “WarmiLab” es parte de una de las incubadoras de negocio más importantes del país.</li>
<li>Una experiencia transformacional para más de 60 jóvenes: incluidos participantes y coachs.</li>
<li>Todos los participantes directos del tour han logran aumentar su autoconfianza, creatividad y potencializado su talento para poder realizar actividades en pro de la sociedad.</li>
<li>Somos apoyados por personalidades emprendedoras peruanas, que están entre los más innovadores: Vania Masias, Cinepapaya, ASEP, entre otros.</li>
<li>La comunidad de “Emprendimiento Social” en el Perú se ha visto fortalecida por la articulación de diferentes actores (emprendedores, inversores, incubadoras, voluntarios, entre otros).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>¿Para qué servirá la colecta?</strong></p>
<p>Para seguir potenciando el sistema del emprendimiento social!</p>
<p>En febrero del 2017 tenemos que seguir trabajando, inspirando y apoyando a jóvenes  apasionados, que con sus ideas y proyectos pueden aportar al cambio positivo de la sociedad.  Por eso, para el “Wayna Tour de Febrero de 2017”, seleccionaremos a 30 jóvenes, para que, durante 8 días, puedan vivir una experiencia inspiradora y única, de desarrollo personal e innovación. Contamos con las más grandes referencias peruanas de emprendimiento, que compartirán su pasión estos jóvenes de alto potencial</p>
<p>Después de estos días transformacionales, TENEMOS EL RETO DE DARLE EL MEJOR DE LOS SEGUIMIENTOS A LOS PARTICIPANTES Y A SUS PROYECTOS A TRAVÉS DEL PROGRAMA “PRIMEROS PASOS”. Por eso, estamos apuntando a crear una plataforma web que pueda ayudar a los emprendedores al comienzo de sus proyectos. Buscamos implementar un business model viable e innovador, pero necesitamos TU AYUDA para lanzarlo.</p>
<p>Tenemos el reto de potencializar nuestro camino de auto-sostenibilidad. Para poder seguir siendo un actor clave de en la potenciación de proyectos de alto impacto que transformen realidades de todo el país, TE NECESITAMOS PARA PODER SEGUIR HACIENDO EL CAMBIO TODOS JUNTOS.</p>
<p>¡Su participación en esta causa nos beneficiará enormemente !Permitirá a jóvenes de Perú y Colombia desarrollar proyectos para servir y transformar positivamente a la sociedad!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Wiñay Wayna</strong></p>
<p>Wiñay Wayna, which means ""forever young"" in quechua, is a social enterprise, made up of young people from Peru, Colombia and France. These group of youngsters have dedicated to social entrepreneurship in Latin America, for over a year, being part of the formation of several social projects, having as key players young people from different cities all over Peru. This way, they can develop their potential and talent throughout a transformational journey, where they will create a high-impact project for society.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>""Wayna Tour Frebruary 2017""</strong></p>
<p><u>Social Entrepreneurship Tour</u></p>
<p>Social entrepreneurship is a path peruvians need to consider in order to achieve a positive change in their society. Through various sources, we have found that there are many people wanting to generate sustainable social impact, but they have many barriers to achieve this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Few people can accomplish their goals of social impact, mainly because there is no space to discuss and learn about the experiences of successful social entrepreneurs.</li>
<li>Many high potential entrepreneurs fail to accomplish their goals due to their lack of self-confidence. Getting know your self is fundamental for this kind of ventures. </li>
<li>Entrepreneurs need to know how to structure their projects. In absence of a culture of entrepreneurship, people do not know how to grow and achieve sustainability.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What’s the impact of this project?</strong></p>
<p>During our first year, we have worked with more than 55 young people (between the ages of 19 and 34), in over 10 cities of Peru, through our three social entrepreneur tours. We work with an innovative educational program based on the ""3i methodology”: inspiration, introspection and innovation.</p>
<p>During a transformational journey, the participants experience the 3i methodology which supports them during the formation process of their project, helping them to realize their passion and the social problems that they can and want to resolve. This experience potentiates the optimal development of their creativity, talent, self-esteem, self-confidence and civic identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What have we achieved so far?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mentoring more than 120 young people with scalable social projects.</li>
<li>Training more than 15 current projects with high social impact. All of its creators have been part of Wayna Tour.</li>
<li>Orientation to highly scalable social projects. I.E. ""EcoBaf"" project has been well received by senior investors; ""WarmiLab"" is part of one of the most important “business incubators” start-ups of the country.</li>
<li>A transformational experience for 60 young people, including participants and coaches.</li>
<li>All direct participants in the tour have manage to increase their self-confidence, creativity and potentiated their talent to perform activities for society.</li>
<li>We have the support of highly recognized peruvian entrepreneurs, such as Vania Masias, Cinepapaya, ASEP, among others.</li>
<li>The community of ""Social Entrepreneurship"" in Peru has been strengthened by the articulation of different actors (entrepreneurs, investors, incubators, volunteers, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are we raising this funds for?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>TO SUSTAIN THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP SYSTEM! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On february 2017 we have to continue working, inspiring and passionately supporting youth, with their ideas and projects that can bring positive change in society. So for the ""Wayna Tour february 2017"", we will select 30 young people who will live an 8-day unique and inspiring experience of personal development and innovation. We have the support of the best entrepreneurial references who can share their passion to young people with high potential.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After these transformational days, WE HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF MONITORING THE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR PROJECTS, THROUGH THE PROGRAM “FIRST STEPS”. Therefore, we are aiming to create a web platform that can help entrepreneurs make their first steps of their project. We seek to implement a viable and innovative business model, but we need your help to launch it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our challenge is to take a big step into self-sustainability. We need you in order to remain as a key player for propelling high-impact projects that transform realities across the country, so we can continue making change all together.</p>
<p>Your participation in this cause benefit us greatly! It will allow young people from Peru and Colombia develop projects to serve and transform society positively. </p>

Hace un año, estos jóvenes vienen apostando por el emprendimiento social en Latinoamérica,  ayudando en la formación de proyectos sociales de diferentes rubros, teniendo como actores clave a jóvenes de las diferentes ciudades del Perú, para que estos puedan revelar su potencial y talento, y puedan ponerlo al servicio de la sociedad.
Wayna Tour Febrero 2017
""Tour de Emprendimiento Social""
El emprendimiento social es un camino que los peruanos necesitan tomar en cuenta para poder lograr un cambio positivo en la sociedad. A través de diversas fuentes, hemos encontrado que existen muchas personas con ganas de generar impacto social sostenible, pero tienen muchas barreras para conseguirlo:

Muy pocos pueden hacer realidad sus ideas de impacto social, principalmente porque no existen espacios para conversar y conocer las experiencias de un emprendedor social exitoso.
Hay muchas personas con un alto potencial, pero muchos no creen en ellos mismos, lo cual genera que muchos emprendedores se caigan en el camino. Conocerse a uno mismo es la base de un emprendimiento.
Hace falta que los emprendedores sepan estructurar sus proyectos. Al no existir una cultura del emprendimiento, las personas no saben cómo crecer y lograr sostenibilidad.

¿Cómo aporta este proyecto?
En este primer año como empresa, hemos podido impactar directamente a más de 55 jóvenes de entre 19 a 34 años, de más de 10 ciudades de Perú, en tres tours de emprendimiento social. Trabajamos bajo el programa pedagógico innovador: la “metodología 3i”: inspiración, introspección e innovación.
Durante este viaje transformacional, los participantes experimentan este método, el cual acompaña a los participantes en el proceso de formación de su proyecto y en el reconocimiento de su pasión y de las problemáticas sociales que quiere y puede resolver. Esta experiencia potencializa el desarrollo óptimo de su creatividad, talento, autoestima, autoconfianza e identidad ciudadana.
¿Que se hemos alcanzado hasta ahora?
Mentoría a más de 120 jóvenes con proyectos sociales escalables.
Formación a más de 15 proyectos sociales de alto impacto actualmente en marcha. Todos sus creadores han sido parte del Wayna Tour.

Orientación a proyectos sociales de alta escalabilidad. Ejemplos: el proyecto “EcoBaf” ha recibido el acojo de inversionistas de alto rango, “WarmiLab” es parte de una de las incubadoras de negocio más importantes del país.
Una experiencia transformacional para más de 60 jóvenes: incluidos participantes y coachs.
Todos los participantes directos del tour han logran aumentar su autoconfianza, creatividad y potencializado su talento para poder realizar actividades en pro de la sociedad.
Somos apoyados por personalidades emprendedoras peruanas, que están entre los más innovadores: Vania Masias, Cinepapaya, ASEP, entre otros.
La comunidad de “Emprendimiento Social” en el Perú se ha visto fortalecida por la articulación de diferentes actores (emprendedores, inversores, incubadoras, voluntarios, entre otros).

¿Para qué servirá la colecta?
Para seguir potenciando el sistema del emprendimiento social!
En febrero del 2017 tenemos que seguir trabajando, inspirando y apoyando a jóvenes  apasionados, que con sus ideas y proyectos pueden aportar al cambio positivo de la sociedad.  Por eso, para el “Wayna Tour de Febrero de 2017”, seleccionaremos a 30 jóvenes, para que, durante 8 días, puedan vivir una experiencia inspiradora y única, de desarrollo personal e innovación. Contamos con las más grandes referencias peruanas de emprendimiento, que compartirán su pasión estos jóvenes de alto potencial
Después de estos días transformacionales, TENEMOS EL RETO DE DARLE EL MEJOR DE LOS SEGUIMIENTOS A LOS PARTICIPANTES Y A SUS PROYECTOS A TRAVÉS DEL PROGRAMA “PRIMEROS PASOS”. Por eso, estamos apuntando a crear una plataforma web que pueda ayudar a los emprendedores al comienzo de sus proyectos. Buscamos implementar un business model viable e innovador, pero necesitamos TU AYUDA para lanzarlo.
Tenemos el reto de potencializar nuestro camino de auto-sostenibilidad. Para poder seguir siendo un actor clave de en la potenciación de proyectos de alto impacto que transformen realidades de todo el país, TE NECESITAMOS PARA PODER SEGUIR HACIENDO EL CAMBIO TODOS JUNTOS.
¡Su participación en esta causa nos beneficiará enormemente !Permitirá a jóvenes de Perú y Colombia desarrollar proyectos para servir y transformar positivamente a la sociedad!
 
About Wiñay Wayna
Wiñay Wayna, which means ""forever young"" in quechua, is a social enterprise, made up of young people from Peru, Colombia and France. These group of youngsters have dedicated to social entrepreneurship in Latin America, for over a year, being part of the formation of several social projects, having as key players young people from different cities all over Peru. This way, they can develop their potential and talent throughout a transformational journey, where they will create a high-impact project for society.
 
""Wayna Tour Frebruary 2017""
Social Entrepreneurship Tour
Social entrepreneurship is a path peruvians need to consider in order to achieve a positive change in their society. Through various sources, we have found that there are many people wanting to generate sustainable social impact, but they have many barriers to achieve this:

Few people can accomplish their goals of social impact, mainly because there is no space to discuss and learn about the experiences of successful social entrepreneurs.
Many high potential entrepreneurs fail to accomplish their goals due to their lack of self-confidence. Getting know your self is fundamental for this kind of ventures. 
Entrepreneurs need to know how to structure their projects. In absence of a culture of entrepreneurship, people do not know how to grow and achieve sustainability.

 
What’s the impact of this project?
During our first year, we have worked with more than 55 young people (between the ages of 19 and 34), in over 10 cities of Peru, through our three social entrepreneur tours. We work with an innovative educational program based on the ""3i methodology”: inspiration, introspection and innovation.
During a transformational journey, the participants experience the 3i methodology which supports them during the formation process of their project, helping them to realize their passion and the social problems that they can and want to resolve. This experience potentiates the optimal development of their creativity, talent, self-esteem, self-confidence and civic identity.
 
What have we achieved so far?

Mentoring more than 120 young people with scalable social projects.
Training more than 15 current projects with high social impact. All of its creators have been part of Wayna Tour.
Orientation to highly scalable social projects. I.E. ""EcoBaf"" project has been well received by senior investors; ""WarmiLab"" is part of one of the most important “business incubators” start-ups of the country.
A transformational experience for 60 young people, including participants and coaches.
All direct participants in the tour have manage to increase their self-confidence, creativity and potentiated their talent to perform activities for society.
We have the support of highly recognized peruvian entrepreneurs, such as Vania Masias, Cinepapaya, ASEP, among others.
The community of ""Social Entrepreneurship"" in Peru has been strengthened by the articulation of different actors (entrepreneurs, investors, incubators, volunteers, etc.).

What are we raising this funds for?
 
TO SUSTAIN THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP SYSTEM! 
 
On february 2017 we have to continue working, inspiring and passionately supporting youth, with their ideas and projects that can bring positive change in society. So for the ""Wayna Tour february 2017"", we will select 30 young people who will live an 8-day unique and inspiring experience of personal development and innovation. We have the support of the best entrepreneurial references who can share their passion to young people with high potential.
 
After these transformational days, WE HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF MONITORING THE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR PROJECTS, THROUGH THE PROGRAM “FIRST STEPS”. Therefore, we are aiming to create a web platform that can help entrepreneurs make their first steps of their project. We seek to implement a viable and innovative business model, but we need your help to launch it.
 
Our challenge is to take a big step into self-sustainability. We need you in order to remain as a key player for propelling high-impact projects that transform realities across the country, so we can continue making change all together.
Your participation in this cause benefit us greatly! It will allow young people from Peru and Colombia develop projects to serve and transform society positively.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>At the start, Silversyde was just a dream, an idea I had that matched a vision from my youth: An avenue to express myself; the pain i'd suffered, the pain I'd inflicted, and all the brokenness in between through the beautiful whirlwind of music and poetry. A specific type of poetry that could cross generational gaps and penetrate cultural differences, that could be shared in families and enjoyed by young and old alike, but most of all, be relatable!</p>
<p>YOU, our listeners can be passionate about the music we create because we are passionate about it! You can get behind this project because we've gotten behind it, and we have given everything we have to make sure that our albums get into the hands of those drowning in self image issues, to those who are struggling with seeing their self worth, or who have been bullied so much that they are blinded by their own anger, or have turned to self-harm as a way to release their pain.  To those who just lost a parent and are in a pain so real it's suffocating them. These are the broken, the ones our music is designed and crafted for... </p>
<p>Music has always been an emotional outlet for me, a way to express how I'm feeling. Since we created our first album in 2011, we noticed how our songs struck an emotional chord with our listeners. It was through the healing I was experiencing as I wrote that made the topics so raw and real. I feel as though my healing continues through each new song or lyric we write, and will continue to help me heal along with so many others as long as we have the opportunity to create. </p>
<p>There is no exception for our new album 'In The Dark'. It's being written and constructed for YOU, your kids, your friends, co-workers, and their families. Together with your help we can leave a mark on lives that will resound through eternity! -Laura </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our champaign will span the course of two months (60 days) where we will raise the $15,000 needed to make our full length album. We have a network of professionals who will assist us along the way helping to create 'In The Dark', SILVERSYDE's newest full length album.</p>
<p>We anticipate a mid November 2017 release to give ourselves time to finish the writing process, record demos, track vocals and then record with our team of greats in order to make the best product that we have to date. Of course the summer is reserved for us to tour as we write and test our new material out for YOU! The cost of recording is estimated at $12,000, $1,500 for duplication and disc manufacturing and $1,500 for marketing and unexpected costs.</p>
<p>Along with some awesome items to thank you for your support we will also be offering some one of a kind exclusive perks that you can only receive through this campaign.</p>
<p>With our flexible goal in place all funds received will go to directly to album production as specified above. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Honesty...<br/>Honesty and transparency are the building blocks of what makes our music, well, 'Silversyde'...   So, to keep in theme, lets have a little honesty about this fundraiser. Are we nervous about putting our needs and goal into one platform? Yes! Do we feel intimidated as we take this step towards making an album that will embody the emotion and feeling of our new music and message? Yes!  Are we nervous about the response and support that we may or may not get? Yes. But, we trust in the mission that we've been on; bringing hope to those who are without, bringing a message of healing through the One who has commissioned us to serve a world that is hurting and broken. And to love! Love unabashedly, unashamedly and without remorse.</p>
<p>This album is going to reach deep lyrically, hit hard emotionally, and sonically deliver the refined sound that you know and love from our band with an evolved, modern hard rock edge and thunderous riffs!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As some of you may know, our lead singer Laura and bassist husband Nathan, have recently brought a beautiful baby girl into this world and into our lives. Although touring with an additional member in diapers does pose it's challenges, this new journey is one we will not shy away from. Since we spend the majority of our year on the road touring the country, it makes it harder for us to pause and take time to record a new album and especially fund it.</p>
<p>We thouroghly believe in seasons of life, and more recently, a season of growth. This growth in our band and ministry has only just begun to blossom over the last few years. It has come from years of pursuing a dream we were told was impossible, persevering through personal loss and pain, and persistence when we were told to give up. Though our surroundings and circumstances may change, are ""calling"" and mission has not. The time and effort we spent on the road ministering to people, sharing our stories and building relationships with people from all walks and faiths is imperative to what we do. The road is hard, thankless and at most times unforgiving, but it makes the progress we see in lives changed worth it, and gives us the strength its going to take to make this new season of life work. Every dime raised towards our goal goes directly to make this album and it's expenses, to change lives and make an impact in this generation!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand more than most that your hard earned money is a priceless commodity, and some of you cannot give in the way you wish you could. If you fall into this category there is hope for sure!</p>
<p>First, know that we covet your thoughts and prayers as we embark on this new journey, and second, we need YOU to help spread the word to your friends, family, and co-workers alike, to help reach our goal today! If a lyric or melody we've created has touched your life in some way, just think of how many others we could reach with your help, and how many more hearts can be touched in the same way! </p>
<p>So what are you waiting for lets change the world together; one album, one tour and one day at a time! Share this campaign on your social media outlets and let's get started together!</p>

(Metalliville.com, December 2015 by Dave Attrill)</p><p>""You can hear it in their music, sophomore album 'ShadowTech' boasting influences such as Sabbath and Lizzy. And then there's their playing; this is a band full of the kind of swagger that's born of miles on the road and hours in the studio.

(Powerplay, October 2015 by Wayne Simmons)</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>There will always be risks associated with a breathtaking challenge like releasing a double album on vinyl. The biggest hurdle is to come up with the money to pay the designers, the pressing companies, the promoters etc. Another hurdle is to find the right people to work with. We only work with individuals and companies that have a record of delivering great work, and are reliable (keeping deadlines, for example). These individuals and companies are understandable more costly than the average ones… We always strive to give our fans the best possible experience of Ohmwork. Therefore - 'Alyssa Drone' will come with a hefty prize. For that we hope our listeners and fans can help us remove some of the burden.</p><p>Ohmwork will sign a new record deal in 2017. The hard rock/metal label, Rob Mules Records will be the perfect place for us the take this band and music to greater heights.

And then there's their playing; this is a band full of the kind of swagger that's born of miles on the road and hours in the studio. They're tight, too: the kind of tightness that only three-pieces seem able to muster; the instruments practically breathing together."" (Powerplay, October 2015 by Wayne Simmons)Risks & ChallengesThere will always be risks associated with a breathtaking challenge like releasing a double album on vinyl. The biggest hurdle is to come up with the money to pay the designers, the pressing companies, the promoters etc. Another hurdle is to find the right people to work with. We only work with individuals and companies that have a record of delivering great work, and are reliable (keeping deadlines, for example). These individuals and companies are understandable more costly than the average ones… We always strive to give our fans the best possible experience of Ohmwork. Therefore - 'Alyssa Drone' will come with a hefty prize. For that we hope our listeners and fans can help us remove some of the burden.Ohmwork will sign a new record deal in 2017. The hard rock/metal label, Rob Mules Records will be the perfect place for us the take this band and music to greater heights. The new album will get full backing in terms of marketing, promotion and physical and digital distribution all over the world.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute we still hope you can help by getting the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for visiting my campaign page. My name is <i><strong>LitaMarie</strong></i> and I am a Singer/Songwriter that enjoys creating positive music as well as Christian music. I am currently working with D-Major, of Kingdom Reggae Productions to produce my first EP - <i>""READY FOR THIS""</i>, to be released this <i>spring 2017</i>. I am very excited about this project and look forward to its completion, but I NEED YOUR HELP!</p>
<p>In order to produce the very best quality ORIGINAL MUSIC, investments must be made. To record/produce and promote this album, and get the reach we need to build our listening audience; (and ultimately grow Kingdom Reggae as a Production company in the UK), requires capital. Projects like this do not come cheap, and the cost of promotion alone is enough to bring the overall project to a halt. Rather than delay this project for another year or more, I decided to reach out to the very people who have been pushing me, and pushing me for years, to do more with my gift. </p>
<p><br/>When producing Christian Music, the goal differs from that of the ""ordinary singer/performer"". The music created, has a divine purpose to reach as many people possible. There are people out there in search of something that has the power to heal, encourage, and inspire them. Music is powerful when it is created and influenced from God. It is my belief that my music has the power to change lives; and that the more lives I'm able to reach, the more change I can influence. When I pray, I pray for God to show me how to use my gifts and talents in order to please Him. Being able to create music is more than a vision...this is my purpose.</p>
<p><i>Testimonies aren't testimonies if they are kept to ourselves. - LitaMarie </i></p>
<p><br/><i>In advance</i>, I would like to thank all those who believe in what Kingdom Reggae and I are doing, and want to be a part of this journey by making a donation. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The total project cost is estimated at £20,000 (25,000 USD). Some of the things we are hoping to cover with these funds are: recording &amp; production costs for all 6 songs, promotion, outreach &amp; resources for the EP as well as select singles, transportation to various locations within the UK, Music videos for selected songs and merchandising. </li>
<li>We are giving investors an opportunity to pre-purchase this album. Not only will you secure your order, but it will provide additional funding towards the production costs etc. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a shortage of positive music available, and I want to contribute to changing this.</p>
<p>My gift of writing has touched many, many lives in the past, and I do not doubt that this will only increase with professionalism and promotion lead by spiritual guidance. I have a desire to influence people positively. </p>
<p>Those who know me, know me to be pretty transparent. I am not perfect, and do not make any claims to be. I am flawed, I struggle to stay on the path God has for me, and fall short more often than i'm proud of. But I love God, and I try my best to rely on Him for guidance; even after my mistakes.</p>
<p>I believe people can better connect with someone who never tries to present themselves as perfect. Someone who can make mistakes publicly without hiding away in shame until they feel they are perfect enough to show their face. Being bold isn't a part of my make-up, but being honest is. Feeling ashamed of things to the point of self destruction isn't my struggle.</p>
<p>What makes me a Christian? I believe in Jesus Christ as Lord, and at the end of my flaws, guilt, mistakes, shame, arrogance, pride or whatever sinful traits are in me; I have a relationship with a God who see's through all of that. I know the ONLY One who is able to make the repairs necessary in my life; and as many times necessary in order to build me up as a person who He can use as a Light in a very dark world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If the financial goal isn't met according to our target date, the funds received will remain invested into this project as we continue to find innovative ways to raise additional funds. The lack of funding could have influence on the completion date. The standards of the production will not be lowered to accommodate the limited funds, and the project may be forced to be extended.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Everyone sits in a different place on the financial pyramid. If you are unable to contribute financially, there may be other ways to help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help to spread the word. Share my music, comment, like and share my updates and any other info I may post pertaining to this project and upcoming promotional material.</li>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>If I had to choose three things I'm interested in as an artist, I might say sound, chance and process. In January of this year I had an idea to create a series of soiree-style events centered around ice as a way to draw attention to the connections between artistic processes and geological processes. Before long I became especially interested in one of those events: blocks of ice hang from a support structure and drip onto surfaces of various materials. The surfaces are fitted with microphones and amplified. This was the kernel of what would become thaw.</p>
<p>Soon after, I got a sneak peek at Music for Icebergs, a new album of ambient music by my fellow Rutgers alum Mike Sayre. I was struck not only by the beauty and originality of the music but also by how well it would meld with my budding ice project. Thanks to Mike's inspiring music, it's now become an immersive event with original music scored by myself, dance, painting, and spoken word, featuring some of the best artists I know. </p>
<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>I am interested in sound for sound's sake and in the role chance plays in life and art. In addition to the ice sound-sculpture, my original score for this project will utilize elements of indeterminacy, leaving certain parameters up to the performer. Some timings are exact, others are more free. Some content is prescribed and notated, other content is improvised by the performers.</p>
<p>This event simply wouldn't exist in its current state without Mike Sayre's Music for Icebergs, a 45-minute audio journey through the imagined soundscapes of Antarctica. In Mike's words, it ""pays tribute to a place that is transforming before our eyes"" due to the terrifying reality of climate change. We hope our art in part fosters conversations about the Earth and our place in it. #ClimateArt</p>
<h3>The Event</h3>
<p>thaw will be a 90-minute event, divided into two halves. The first half features a playing of Music for Icebergs, in conjunction with the sounds of the melting ice structure. Attendees will be encouraged to inspect the structure up close and reflect on connections to the music while enjoying the summer evening with food and drink. When the album has played through, it will start again to begin the event's second half, but this time the music and ice sounds will occur simultaneously with live music, dance, and spoken word, all created specifically for the event. My goal is to create a multi-dimensional sensory experience that is truly one-of-a-kind.</p>
<p>I am so lucky to have an incredible team of artists working together on this project and we're ready to bring it to life, but we need your help to get there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The event is set to take place Saturday August 12 at a private residence in Beaverton, OR. We need to raise at least $1400 to cover our production costs, equipment rental, processing fees and most importantly, to pay all of the amazing artists involved for their contributions to this collaborative project. This amount makes sure everyone gets paid a nominal fee; any funds that exceed our goal will go directly to our artists in further appreciation of their dedication to their respective crafts and their commitment to making this event a reality.</p>
<p>I think that artists should be the biggest supporters of other artists. Wealthy benefactors can be hard to come by. Who will support us if we don't support each other? If you are an artist, won't you consider contributing? I will happily help promote your latest endeavor on my platform.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Be sure to click on the perk you want on the right side of this page! You can also donate without ordering a perk by clicking the ""Back It"" button.</p>
<p>$25 - Admission to the event! I like the idea of audience members becoming stakeholders in the event they are attending. In addition, I will post a thank you on social media, and if you're an artist, I will happily promote your latest project. Let's help each other!</p>
<p>$50 - All of the above perks plus our very talented painter Phoebe Rivas will create a unique, hand-painted 4x6"" postcard, then I'll write you a thank you note and mail it to you!</p>
<p>$100 - All of the above perks plus as a very special thank you, I will write a brand new piece for you! It will be a short work incorporating indeterminacy, and you can even have a say in a few details concerning its creation. Please allow until September for completion of this perk.</p>

<h3>Featured Artists</h3>
<p>Mike Sayre - composer, sound artist</p>
<p>Matt Cichon - dancer, choreographer</p>

<h3>What I do as a musician:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why do we need to label music? Labels tell us for whom and to what purpose a product is intended but music, like air and water, should be for everyone. Early in my career I was labelled a “classical” saxophone performer. I later became interested in contemporary composition and was then labelled then a “young” composer. However, by developing my skills in both fields, I shed both labels to create a synergy between my technical ability as a performer on the saxophone and my creativity as a composer. Within this context, I use my knowledge of saxophone technique to exploit the instrument to its full potential and then benefit from exclusive new repertoire that’s tailored to my specifications and ability. </li>
<li>After fifteen year of composing, my works have been performed in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Russia, Brazil and South Korea and have received accolades from the performers and the audience alike. Despite all this success, there are still no professional studio recordings of my saxophone music available for purchase. It's time to change this.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Where I am and what I need :</h3>
<ul><li>My project is already partially funded by the Ontario Arts Council and, according to their guidelines, I must complete it this year or I have to return the funding. There is basically no risk of this project not being completed. All the pieces we're recording have been rehearsed, the producer, a recording engineer, the additional musicians and the recording studio have all been booked and we start recording August 4th 2017. This is all fantastic but, I need an additional $3000 to cover the post-recording costs associated to mastering, graphic design and manufacturing.</li></ul>
<h3>What I'm recording:</h3>
<p>With your help, I'll be recording the following works:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Tango à trois,</i> composed in 2006 for violin, alto saxophone and piano</li>
<li>
<i>Rhapsodie en hommage à Debussy</i>, composed in 2012 for clarinet, alto saxophone and piano</li>
<li>
<i>Through the Ethereal Gate</i>, composed in 2015 for soprano saxophone/theremin</li>
<li>
<i>On the Shores of Eternity</i>, composed in 2017 for soprano saxophone/theremin</li>
<li>
<i>Twelve Tone Rag</i>, composed in 2014 for alto saxophone and piano</li>
<li>
<i>Élégie automnale</i>, composed in 2014 for soprano saxophone and piano</li>
<li>
<i>Trio concertant</i>, composed in 2009 for violin, alto saxophone and piano</li>
<li>
<i>The Four Elements</i>, composed in 2014 for solo alto saxophone</li>
</ul>
<h3>What you get:</h3>
<ul></ul>
<ul><li>I don't see this campaign as begging for your money. I'm offering you the opportunity to invest in advertisement, reserve a signed copy of my CD for the price it will cost once it's printed and acquire a limited reproduction of a manuscript of a historically important work.  As a backer you will have access to the following unique perks:<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tier 1:</strong> For a donation of $5 your name will be added to the list of benefactors on my website. If you desire, I will also enable a hyperlink on your name so that visitors to my web page can click on your name and consult your website. Donations under the $25 mark are appreciated but do not get you a copy of the CD.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tier 2:</strong> For a donation of $25 you will receive an autographed copy of <i>The Road to the Ethereal Gate</i> CD, the project for which I'm running this campaign. You will also get the perks from Tier 1.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tier 3:</strong> For a donation of $100, you will receive a framed facsimile of a handwritten page of my composition <i>Though the Ethereal Gate </i>with a signed and personalized message thanking you. This makes an excellent conversation piece and is a wonderful decoration for your office, your study or your living room. You will also get the perks from Tier 2 and Tier 1.</li>
<li>If I do not reach the goal of $3000, I will use the funds raised during the campaign towards my project and I will keep looking for other sources of funding. <strong>All backers will receive all the perks to which they are entitled regardless of the outcome of the campaign.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beyond the entertainment value of the music I will record, this project has a massive impact on my career and Canadian music. This recording will not only help with the visibility of my performance and compositions, but will have an exponential impact on the sale of my sheet music. This recording will be used by institutions such as the Canadian Music Centre who will promote the CD and the sheet music it publishes. This CD will also serve as a reference recording for all the saxophone players interested in new Canadian repertoire.</li>
<li>In short, this project is happening. There will be a professionally recorded CD of my compositions released through the Canadian Music Centre's Centrediscs label in late 2017- early 2018. The question is: Do you want to be part of it and how much do you want to help?</li>

As a tween,I became a series regular in the first Spanish family comedy Sanchez of Bel Air for the USA network and recurred on NBC's My 2 Dads.</p><p>I also formed a girl band after high school called Nobody's Angel, we were signed to Hollywood Records.Releasing our debut album in 2000, opening up for Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys and sang on movie soundtracks like ParentTrap, Pokemon, The Wedding Planner and 102 Dalmations. In 2002, we earned our very first gold record for two of our songs on the Princess Diaries soundtrack.</p><p>SO, from my experience I always  thought the ONLY time you hire a marketing and pr firm  is when you have a network tv show or are signed to a major label. After releasing two albums and learning that most of my fellow indie kindie artists actually are ALL paying for marketing and pr I was like WHOA! Who Knew?</p><p>I must say, Im super proud of both amazing albums that were released and a HUGE shout out  to ALL the families who have been supporting me from day one because of all the families and kids who have attended my Live Concerts they are the ones who helped me grow to the masses, they are the ones who spread the word and who opened doors for me !</p><h3><strong>How it all began for Twinkle Time:</strong></h3><p>In <strong>2007</strong> -I  had this vision this dream of being a musical artist for kids and teaching kids positive messages through song and dance. I said to myself I want to be like Oprah for the children's market ! I realized that kids and parents were listening to the same kid songs that I grew up with.

I have 2 albums currently out TwinkleTime and Made In The U.S.A. (neither album had  a marketing campaign behind them)Why you ask ???? O.k. ....fine ill tell ya....MORE back story.....Meet Twinkle's alter ego Alitzah ""like Pizza""...Back Story: I grew up in show business performing at the young age of eight in numerous musical productions, voiceovers,and commercials. As a tween,I became a series regular in the first Spanish family comedy Sanchez of Bel Air for the USA network and recurred on NBC's My 2 Dads.I also formed a girl band after high school called Nobody's Angel, we were signed to Hollywood Records.Releasing our debut album in 2000, opening up for Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys and sang on movie soundtracks like ParentTrap, Pokemon, The Wedding Planner and 102 Dalmations. In 2002, we earned our very first gold record for two of our songs on the Princess Diaries soundtrack.SO, from my experience I always  thought the ONLY time you hire a marketing and pr firm  is when you have a network tv show or are signed to a major label. After releasing two albums and learning that most of my fellow indie kindie artists actually are ALL paying for marketing and pr I was like WHOA! Who Knew?I must say, Im super proud of both amazing albums that were released and a HUGE shout out  to ALL the families who have been supporting me from day one because of all the families and kids who have attended my Live Concerts they are the ones who helped me grow to the masses, they are the ones who spread the word and who opened doors for me !How it all began for Twinkle Time:In 2007 -I  had this vision this dream of being a musical artist for kids and teaching kids positive messages through song and dance. I said to myself I want to be like Oprah for the children's market ! I realized that kids and parents were listening to the same kid songs that I grew up with. I wanted to hear new sounds,introduce a whole new vibe to the kindie world! From my vision in 2007 it took over a year for me to finish  writing songs with hubby James Dallas (Former Lead Singer Songwriter-Producer of Boy Band Youngstown who was also once signed to Hollywood Records) to actually putting my show up on its feet.Twinkle Time is a Family Affair !As Twinkle I made my first television appearance on FOX LA morning news in April of 2009 which caught the eye of Main Stream Music on Warner Music,which then signed me to a distribution deal only -What does that mean- they basically pressed the album for me (NO marketing dollars or budgets)  I as an indie artist  with two pennies to rub together now just became the record company,booking agent,pr,social media director,producer and artist all rolled into one. In November 2009, Twinkle's debut CD Twinkle Time was released.May 2010 I was featured in a national commercial for Toyota as Twinkle which helped to bring funds to produce some online content and purchase music gear for my local shows to continue building and growing Twinkle Time.I released  my second CD, Made In The USA, in 2012. (STILL no marketing dollars) The album won two Global Music Awards for Best Children's Song (""Made In The U.S.A"") and Best Children's Album.From performing my live shows in LosAngeles I caught the eye of an executive in  2013 that was able to place my new music videos in the children’s clothing retailer Gymboree and Crazy 8, resulting in my music videos streaming in more than 1,200 stores worldwide. In addition was honored when National Council of La Raza (NCLR)asked me to be a brand ambassador and perform for their Family Expo in New Orleans.Thats when we started our first Indie Go Go to help raise funds to bring us to New Orleans, LA(We totally hit our goal THANKS to ALL of you!)As my Live Touring show started to grow in 2013 I have since appeared on CNN Espanol, Telemundo, Azteca TV, WGNO- ABC ,Univison and KTLA and was interviewed on LA's #1 radio station 102.7 KISS FM.In  March 2015, I was super stoked to  be able to write the song KIDZ ROCK with a long time producer friend Emmy award winning song writer Matthew Gerrard he wrote the theme songs for Hannah Montana, both High School Musicals and  Dora the Explorer and so much more.The big plan was to have the 3rd album  released in late fall of 2015 or at the beginning of 2016.  I had a huge deal that ended up falling through (Waa,Waa,Waa) SOOOOO.....most people would've thrown in the towel but not me!  ""A winner never quits and quitter never wins!

<h3><strong>Since my first performance in Stroud I have been in love with the town, it's people and the art community thriving there. </strong></h3>
<p>I've had this idea of releasing a limited edition vinyl accompanied by a music video shot in Stroud on my mind for a long time. This campaign will help me achieve exactly what I have created in my mind - A 10"" <i>Limited Edition</i> Vinyl + a Music Video that <i>*feels like Stroud*.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513162354/p0khyy1kdckrc2djoed0.jpg"" src=""""/>(Photo - Screenshot from the music video)</p>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>I want to produce a 10"" vinyl single (X2 tracks : 1 song either side -<i> <strong>Side A. </strong>Vocal version</i> // <strong>Side B.</strong><i> Instrumental</i>) that is going to look and sound beautiful. With this campaign, it will enable me to do just that. The final release will have hand-drawn pencil drawings on double sided artwork on the record sleeve as well as CLEAR vinyl and text on the spine so you can find it on your shelf (I've lost count of how many records I have misplaced over the years because there is no text on the side ('spine') of the artwork!)</p>
<p>With your help I will be able to get excellent artwork, sound production and pressing rather than producing a black vinyl, with no artwork and a sound that doesn't quite cut it. </p>
<p>I just want to cover costs and MAKE IT HAPPEN :) The bulk of the campaign cost is solely to have the physical vinyl pressed.</p>

<h3>How you can get involved:</h3>
<p>Hopefully the perks sound reasonable and fair in pricing :) I really like the idea of people who contribute to having their names credited in music videos and on artwork supplied with vinyl, so here's a chance to be credited at the end of the music video... or BOTH! I also love doing house shows, so if anyone out there wants The Uplifter in their front room, garden (or any venue)... I'm all yours! I've printed a whole heap of merchandise to coincide with this crowdfunding campaign. The prints have come out lovely : on the Tshirts, mugs and bags :)</p>
<h3>Stroud - A town worth visiting:</h3>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the town of Stroud (I recommend a visit to the town and an event at SVA (Stroud Valley Artspace), there will be a purely instrumental version of the tune on Side B.</p>

<h3>Release date &amp; when <i>your</i> vinyl will arrive:</h3>
<p>I have pressed vinyl before and know too well that things do not always go exactly to plan with pressings and artwork... So with this in mind, once (and only then) the finished product is in my hands I will book in a show at Stroud Valley Artspace as the official record launch. They've given the big thumbs up and I'd love you to be there<i>. I am <strong>aiming </strong>to have these dispatched and on their way by Christmas.</i></p>
<h2>Don't have a record player?</h2>
<p>Perhaps this record could be the first of your record collection :) I remember my first record deck, it's still going strong as well as the records I bought with it...

</div></div>","Since my first performance in Stroud I have been in love with the town, it's people and the art community thriving there. 
I've had this idea of releasing a limited edition vinyl accompanied by a music video shot in Stroud on my mind for a long time. This campaign will help me achieve exactly what I have created in my mind - A 10"" Limited Edition Vinyl + a Music Video that *feels like Stroud*.
(Photo - Screenshot from the music video)
Summary:
I want to produce a 10"" vinyl single (X2 tracks : 1 song either side - Side A. Vocal version // Side B. Instrumental) that is going to look and sound beautiful. With this campaign, it will enable me to do just that. The final release will have hand-drawn pencil drawings on double sided artwork on the record sleeve as well as CLEAR vinyl and text on the spine so you can find it on your shelf (I've lost count of how many records I have misplaced over the years because there is no text on the side ('spine') of the artwork!)
With your help I will be able to get excellent artwork, sound production and pressing rather than producing a black vinyl, with no artwork and a sound that doesn't quite cut it. 
I just want to cover costs and MAKE IT HAPPEN :) The bulk of the campaign cost is solely to have the physical vinyl pressed.
(Photo - Screenshot from the music video)

Costings Breakdown:
1. Vinyl pressing and production (£1550) :
[10"" CUTTING & PRODUCTION OF METALWORK (2 SIDES) 5 X TEST PRESSINGS 200 10"" STANDARD WEIGHT (110G) VINYL - #14 FROSTED CLEAR200 LABELS (1/0 K)200 BLACK PAPER INNERS - 2 HOLES (WHITE INSIDE)200 OUTER SLEEVES (1/0 K) 300GSM WHITE/WHITE CARD WITH GLOSS MACHINE VARNISH 200 3.5MM SPINE
200 SLEEVING/INSERTION200 SHRINK-WRAP200 BOXED AND DELIVERED
+ MASTERING X2 TRACKS
Total Breakdown:

Vinyl Pressing + Mastering : £1550
Music Video - expenses for travel to and from Stroud + production time : £300
Hand Drawn Sleeve Artwork + labels : £100
Music Production / Recording / Songwriting : £0 (all fulfilled by myself)

TOTAL - £1950
(Photo - Screenshot from the music video)
How you can get involved:
Hopefully the perks sound reasonable and fair in pricing :) I really like the idea of people who contribute to having their names credited in music videos and on artwork supplied with vinyl, so here's a chance to be credited at the end of the music video... or BOTH! I also love doing house shows, so if anyone out there wants The Uplifter in their front room, garden (or any venue)... I'm all yours! I've printed a whole heap of merchandise to coincide with this crowdfunding campaign. The prints have come out lovely : on the Tshirts, mugs and bags :)
Stroud - A town worth visiting:
For those of you who are not familiar with the town of Stroud (I recommend a visit to the town and an event at SVA (Stroud Valley Artspace), there will be a purely instrumental version of the tune on Side B.

(Photo - Screenshot from the music video)
Release date & when your vinyl will arrive:
I have pressed vinyl before and know too well that things do not always go exactly to plan with pressings and artwork... So with this in mind, once (and only then) the finished product is in my hands I will book in a show at Stroud Valley Artspace as the official record launch. They've given the big thumbs up and I'd love you to be there. I am aiming to have these dispatched and on their way by Christmas.
Don't have a record player?
Perhaps this record could be the first of your record collection :) I remember my first record deck, it's still going strong as well as the records I bought with it... I love all formats of listening: CDs, Cassettes, Digital downloads but vinyl has to be right up there as my favourite way to experience music. Especially clear vinyl.

Thank You. Really, it means a lot.

<h3> </h3>
<p>Music and people are things that make me smile the most. As a 25 year old Brazilian American lass who grew up in Mississippi, it's been my absolute dream to bring sunshine to people's broken lives and social change to the young generations of the darkened world. </p>
<p>Coming from a large multicultural family of 6 kids, we were always jamming out music together with whatever instruments and props we could find. I began writing music from the age of 8 and knew it was part of my calling. I've now traveled to over 15 countries including Bulgaria, Dominica, New Zealand and England, to name a few. I've been so honored to traverse with my music, playing to young and old singing heartfelt songs and speaking motivational words. My music is said to be ""life-affirming"", ""sunshine to my soul"", ""organic and raw"", ""vulnerable and melodic"". It infuses acoustic roots, ukulele based folk, and soul-pop melodies. </p>
<p>After traveling back to Brazil for multiple family trips and mission endeavors, my heart for my Brazilian home grew larger and larger.  Te amo muitoooo familiaaa e amigos! Meu coração sempre esta com vcs. Abs e bjs pra tudo mundo!!!  I began to see poverty and misplacement on every other corner and knew that there was something I could do about it. A dream and calling was being birthed within me. If I could make music and have profits that could benefit hungry, fatherless and uneducated boys and girls, then my love cup would be full!</p>
<p>So, now is the time. I am embracing my purpose in life, creating art that is producing social enhancement and healing in the country I care about the most. </p>
<p>I moved to Sydney, Australia and brought with me 40 songs. My producer (Billy Otto) and I chose 10 songs that we feel are fitting for this album. I desire that the profits of this album would go towards the non-profit organization that I founded this year. </p>
<p>Here's a run-down of the non-profit I've established: </p>
<p> Project LEO (Loving Everyone Openly), the name is short for Leonardo - a young child in Brasil I was able to help. The movement and mission is about helping the disadvantaged and displaced children of Brazil. We aim to raise funds for orphanages &amp; safe houses, serving children by ""embedding value, instilling hope, and inspiring futures"".  Project LEO has been donated land by several state governors and is in the process of becoming an official non-profit organization.</p>
<p>The Brazilian officials have recognized the need of what I'm offering in aid. Thus, they have been so generous with offering up land in areas of great need, especially in Pernambuco.</p>
<p>With fatherlessness, child abuse, malnutrition and all-round poverty on the rise, Project LEO needs sustainable financial support to make it happen. My music is one of the major vehicles for providing fund flow into the healing hand of Project LEO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Judy’s super-bubbly personality and authentic way of expressing her faith will resonate with the young people. She sang a couple of her originals for me with her ukulele and they’re faith-filled, vulnerable and sometimes fun songs in a much more contemporary folk style. Many of the songs come with a story of the challenges or answers to prayer that inspired them.""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It takes so much time and effort and heart to create a full length album. I really don’t care about that – I love doing this – but unfortunately it also costs quite some dollars. There are costs for renting a studio, paying the musicians, paying the mixing and master engineers, artwork, pressing the album, promoting it etc. Let me show you:</p>
<p><strong>AUDIO </strong></p>
<p>Preproduction, tracking/Recording $7500</p>
<p>Studio hire, musician hire, random expenses (petrol, studio food.) $1180</p>
<p>Mixing $970</p>
<p>Mastering $550</p>
<p>Total = $10,200</p>
<p><strong>GRAPHIC DESIGN </strong></p>
<p>For album art, shirts, and website. We will be working with Melbourne designer Wes Hendricks. </p>
<p>$1400</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I commit to something, I give it my whole heart. You speak to anyone who has worked with me in Brazil or in American summer camps, I'm all in! </p>
<p>The quicker we can get the desired funds the faster I can move with getting the recording done. </p>
<p>If we don't reach the full financial target, I will still make an album. However the quality will not be the standard we are wanting, and the duration of production will most definitely be prolonged. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It would also be really helpful if you tell your friends about this campaign or, even better, share it on social media. </p>

I have had the help and support of professors as well as other fellow Berklee students in order to record and produce the songs of the E.P. This summer, I will be releasing two of my singles ""Madrid"" and ""No Sé De Donde Soy"". Although I have had a lot of help from the people here, now it has come the time to ask you for help. How to support my dreamThe budget that has been proposed is the amount of money that will be needed in order to make our project occur. We will be travelling, performing, recording, filming, and having a press release in most of the countries that we will be visiting: Mexico, Spain, USA, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Honduras. In all of these countries we already have shows booked, radio appearances, music video shoots and other events organized in order to let our music be heard. I open my heart, my dream, and my career to you. If you are in love with the project and can envision the project like we do, please join us in making it happen!  Expenses Chart",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Worship is an interesting thing that we do on a regular basis, but can still feel foreign to us at times. We have been experiencing worship through creativity in songwriting.

The iAM Music Fest is a unique opportunity for the Four Corners region to enjoy a large live performance experience without venturing to larger city areas outside of our community.  The festival endeavors to give Durango and the surrounding area a brand new experience that will deepen the love for music and live art that is growing each year.  The iAM Music Institute believes that performing music is one of the best ways to be a passionate music educator, and this festival will enable that experience in a very meaningful way.As the iAM Music Institute is a new entity, any support we receive for this festival will be integral in seeing the project to completion.  We sincerely appreciate your consideration in our endeavor, and enthusiastically await the festival!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>Omaha Children’s Choir </strong>was founded on the premise that the study of music makes a positive difference in the lives of young people in ways that can help them socially, emotionally, and even academically.  Significantly, it gives them a unique opportunity to learn about their own and other’s cultures and the society in which they live.

</div><h1>Small Town, Small Talk, Statewide Impact<br/>
</h1>a couple of 830 mile long conversations is a long hello to and from Nebraska. One mile at a time, one conversation at a time, this project is about exploring and building connections in the state. I am an expat Brit now living in Omaha who, driven by a belief in the ability of conversation to spur community, will travel the side roads of the state in an RV to engage with Nebraskans. I will set up a public conversation space in towns on the route and talk with residents about their lives, their cultures and their stories. In these conversations, I will travel through places to discover people and, in so doing, reveal Nebraska to ourselves. <br/><h3>
<br/>Project Details</h3><b>The Purpose Behind The Project</b><br/>The project will journey through the Nebraska landscape and its history, approaching Nebraska with honest warmth, open acceptance and sincere curiosity. Honoring a long line of oral history tradition, from traveling troubadours to Alexis de Tocqueville to John Steinbeck to  Charles Kuralt, a couple of 830 mile long conversations will seek and share those narratives that define and unite us. It will celebrate our culture and how we each contribute to it, evoking a place and its people, connecting us to Nebraskans, their stories and their lives. These are tales of joy and despair, courage and disappointment, love and loss, and good deeds and misdeeds that richly illustrate our Nebraska experience. Telling and hearing our stories is an affirmation of our common dignity and a simple act that contributes collectively to our sense of togetherness. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432862359/xvciaj5odtukciuiqdqq.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><b>Why This Matters - Benefiting The Community</b><br/>While there are areas of academic practice and artistic examination related to Nebraskan history, traditions, culture, community and arts, this project synthesizes several approaches holistically through the less commonly explored medium of conversation. There is little comparable work that creates and captures, at a collaborative human level, a statewide local sense of who Nebraskans are and how they speak of creating community. This project will capture the voice of Nebraska as it exists at a particular moment. Like a good conversation, it is ephemeral yet has resonance in its immediacy.<br/><br/>Community outcomes include:<br/><ul>
<li>Giving direct voice to Nebraskans</li>
<li>The contribution of each individual’s narrative to a larger conversational whole, so that everyone becomes an integral piece of the project outcome</li>
<li>Developing broad awareness of and appreciation for other perspectives, increasing our understanding of ourselves and of each other</li>
<li>Reflecting on attitudes and misperceptions between people, whether on a macro scale between the state’s larger urban centers and small rural communities, to divisions based on religion, wealth, education and ethnicity, for example</li>
<li>Providing a platform for consideration of the nature of Nebraskan identities and community, as well as content to energize those discussions<br/>
</li>
</ul><b>The Conversations</b><br/>Every conversation will be spontaneous, without script or agenda. Each conversation will be allowed to take its own course, but with the two following common threads:<br/><ol>
<li>Everyone I speak with will at some point in the conversation be asked, “How do you create community?”</li>
<li>Every conversation will include some point of discussion from prior conversations, enabling all participants to be part of and to contribute to a narrative that progresses across the state.<br/>
</li>
</ol>The daily lives of Nebraskans will be revealed through conversation, such as their sense of connectedness with each other and the land, with family histories, economic concerns, political views, and relationships with social and other institutions. The conversational engagements will surface expressions of alienation and connectedness, individuality and commonality, what it is like to be young and old in a changing environment, and how values and social behaviors in one place are similar or different to another place.<br/><br/><b>The Project in Practice</b><br/>I will drive across Nebraska, starting in Omaha and then stopping at towns on the 830 mile long route, before ending the project back in Omaha. For one day in each town, including Omaha, I will set up a conversation spot at a suitable public location identified, perhaps, with local librarians or other town residents. <br/><br/>Each conversation spot will feature two chairs, a small table, an open-sided canopy, a notice board inviting people to sit and speak and other necessities, such as refreshments. I will audio record the conversations as well as photographing supporting imagery.<br/><br/>During the project, Nebraskans and others will be encouraged to contribute and converse through contemporaneous blogging and social media communications.<br/><br/><b>Who Will Take Part?</b><br/>The audience is deliberately intended to be wide and diverse. For the project itself, it will comprise a slice of the statewide Nebraskan demographic. The project is intended to speak to, with, for and about all Nebraskans. It will capture a new audience by presenting itself invitingly to any and every Nebraskan, placing itself in their towns, streets, community gathering areas and socially trafficked public spaces.<br/><br/><b>Timeline and Route</b><br/>The project will take place during a four week period between August 10 and September 5, 2015. The route is detailed on the attached map. After the road trip, later in 2015 there will be four public presentations across the state.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432590455/tvjywh2pdy0rxwlsbvlc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>The towns on the route were chosen through a combination of reasons including:<br/><ul>

<li>A variety of societal and economic features, such as being a college town, on/adjacent to a Native American reservation, in areas of natural beauty, being an agricultural community, a tourist destination and acclaimed as a great place to raise a family.</li>
</ul><b>After the Project</b><br/>In Fall/Winter 2015 there will be four public presentations across the state in Omaha, Lincoln, Kearney and Scottsbluff. Presentations will include:<br/><ul>

<br/><p><b>Hey friends! My name is Donald MacLennan</b>.

However, I've never taken the plunge to record my own stuff, constantly (and happily) being an accompanist/sideman for some really great music. So, I am super excited to share what I've been up to the last few months... <b>I'm currently producing and recording my first gypsy jazz record</b>! Musically it is coming together splendidly and I can't wait to take you along for the ride!</p>
<p><br/> </p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <br/><br/>I am trying to raise <b>5000$ CDN</b> (or more) to help make this record happen. With the total cost of the project being approximately 7000 CDN, all contributions are integral, and will help pay for:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>the musicians and sound engineer for their expertise and time <br/>
</li>
<li>the many hours recording and mixing in multiple studios <br/>
</li>
<li>mastering the record (very important) <br/>
</li>
<li>album artwork concept/design</li>
<li>manufacturing minimum 1000 CD's</li>
</ul>Please check out the perks!!! There are some cool options I put together for you!!!<br/>I compose different kinds of music, so the <b>personal composition</b> perk is a piece of music that I compose, you provide a title, and I notate out on staff paper and send to you! The <b>Youtube cover</b> perk will be a blast; hit me with your best song, I'll do it. The <b>Limited Edition Mishra's Dream CD</b> perk includes a hard copy of the record I did with the first gypsy jazz group I ever played with, Mishra's Dream (which seems so long ago now, haha). I have a vase full of bows that I used at one point but have become funky ornaments in my home. You can have one with the <b>Shredded Bow</b> perk! The <b>VIP perk</b> will be awesome, can't wait to hang out! The various <b>live concert </b>perks are all about bringing the energy of this record into your home, for an intimate and up-close look at how we play and improvise together, and the <b>concert + beer tasting </b>perk is an awesome evening of gypsy jazz with a special guided craft beer tasting with the Maritimes' only Certified Cicerone, my wife Angeline MacLennan! Peruse all perks, I hope there is something that tickles your fancy. <br/><br/><p>I went for incentives that I think you, the fans, will want,
 and that I will be able to deliver. The exciting thing is, this is the FIRST album that I am showing my stuff, so to speak. I've got a lot more where this is coming from, but this will always be the first, and I need your help to get it out there. It’s all about the music,
 and the long creative process that leads up to having a finished album 
in hand. Again, your participation is so important! With your help, this album will be finished and mass-produced and take over the world (unlikely).</p>
<p>If you can't contribute financially to the campaign, don't worry! I appreciate you taking the time and checking this out, and please let your friends and family know about the project and the cool incentives (there are some share tools through Indiegogo that work well). Thanks so much, can't wait to share, see you out there!</p>

The various live concert perks are all about bringing the energy of this record into your home, for an intimate and up-close look at how we play and improvise together, and the concert + beer tasting perk is an awesome evening of gypsy jazz with a special guided craft beer tasting with the Maritimes' only Certified Cicerone, my wife Angeline MacLennan! Peruse all perks, I hope there is something that tickles your fancy. I went for incentives that I think you, the fans, will want,
 and that I will be able to deliver. The exciting thing is, this is the FIRST album that I am showing my stuff, so to speak. I've got a lot more where this is coming from, but this will always be the first, and I need your help to get it out there. It’s all about the music,
 and the long creative process that leads up to having a finished album 
in hand. Again, your participation is so important! With your help, this album will be finished and mass-produced and take over the world (unlikely).
If you can't contribute financially to the campaign, don't worry! I appreciate you taking the time and checking this out, and please let your friends and family know about the project and the cool incentives (there are some share tools through Indiegogo that work well). Thanks so much, can't wait to share, see you out there!

Within the first five minutes of meeting one another, we sang “Poison and Wine,"" an original by The Civil Wars. Captivated by the harmony and blend of our voices, we knew that we needed to stick together and make music. As the writing continued and the events emerged, we collaborated with Catherine Sandstedt on viola and Daniel Blake on drums. We have now been writing and performing for over a year and one of our biggest questions from fans is ""Can I get a CD?"" Our biggest obstacle in being successful in the music industry is getting our music out to people. Our biggest obstacle in getting our music out to people is being able to afford the cost of recording and producing an album. Now we hope to make that dream a reality with your help.<p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><ul>
<li>We NEED money. Being a band without a label means that everything we do comes straight out of our band fund and our pockets. Any money we make from shows goes directly into the band fund to help us with the recording process, but that money is not nearly enough to cover our costs. Recording is very expensive and we want to get the best product out there for our fans and supporters.</li>
<li>The money that you donate will be going directly toward recording the album, mixing and mastering the songs, and making the CDs and their covers.</li>
<li>We have PERKS! These are all lined out and explained on our campaign page. However, any amount that you can give will help to produce the album and will mean the world to us. Each one of us greatly appreciate your support. </li>

Being able to distribute our music to more people can help us to further raise our profile and have the type of career in music that we've always dreamed of. But that's the obvious part. The question is why does that matter to you. Music is about reaching people. We have all been impacted by music at some point in our lives, and that's largely why the four of us got into it in the first place. It allows us a platform to speak to people about who we are, what we value, and, most importantly, that they should value themselves. We won't pretend like we have the same impact that a teacher or pastor does, but this is how we have found a way to inspire people. We hope you'll help put us in a position to do that on a greater scale.

<p>Hello to all of my family, friends, and followers!</p>
<p>I am very excited to announce that I am creating the next Billboard number-one single, “Blonde In Vuitton”. It’s essentially my blog, snapchat, and Instagram all wrapped into one. Exciting right? Here’s the thing, Mom and Dad have put me on a “budget” and this project doesn’t exactly fit into that. Which is why I need the support of all of you! I know it’s actually crazy that I am asking for your money to fund my project, but I promise that this masterpiece is really for the world, not just for me. It’s something that will truly inspire people to embrace their inner Kyle. The world could use more Kyle’s, don’t you think? Not only will there be audio of me spitting out some epic “take no prisoners” white boy rap, but there will be video. Oh yes, a music video. Professional music video, possibly on Vevo with millions of views. This project is legit (unlike my previous singles) and I legit need all the help I can get to get “Blonde In Vuitton” released by the end of August. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>All money raised goes directly to fund the project. I really need $6,000 to make this project perfect, the majority of which goes directly into the music video. The rest of the funds go to studio fees, the cost of the track, copyrighting and publishing costs. However, if I don’t reach my goal, the project will still happen but on a smaller scale. If you know me, you know I don’t do anything on a small scale, so please reach into your hearts and keep going until you reach your pockets, and contribute whatever you can! </p>
<p>In exchange, you will obviously get a personal thank you for me and a free copy of the single, but you could also get a Instagram or snapchat shoutout to my followers, a personal thank you video, a fun ringtone, handwritten lyric sheet, producer credit, not to mention bragging rights.</p>

As part of our passion and academic experience, I along with several other musicians are putting together an unforgettable theatrical experience, that we have titled <i>Comedy in Love.</i> </p>
<p><i>Comedy in Love</i> will be a performance filled with fun, laughter and beautiful, heartfelt music. This production is launched by young, up and coming artists studying at conservatories including the Juilliard School of Music and the New England Conservatory of Music. They are talented and excited to perform and share the music they love - to an audience that will be inspired.</p>
<p>There will be one matinee performance on August 2nd, at The National Opera Center (330 Seventh Avenue in NYC). It will feature solos and comedic scenes from well-known operas and musicals such as Carousel, Die Fledermaus, Fiddler on the Roof, The Marriage of Figaro and more. Each performer will bring something unique and special to the stage.</p>
<p>To make this a reality, we need to raise at least $2000 to cover expenses for renting the performance hall in New York City, paying the very talented pianists, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">production, design, stage materials and marketing.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If there are any funds left that are not used for this performance, we plan to make a donation to a charitable fund that supports the arts.</span></p>
<p>For young singers, it is difficult and most challenging to get an opportunity to perform on this scale. Creating it ourselves, gives us the chance to experience the challenges and rewards of starting a career in opera or musical theater.<br/></p>
<p>This is why I’m asking for your help. Ticket sales will only cover a small portion of the costs required to produce a show of this caliber. We need your help - any gift you can provide will go a long way toward making this a reality. Your contribution will not only help the performers create this experience, it will also bring joy and laughter to everyone who sees this production this coming August.</p>
<p>We are also saying thank you, with perks and gifts for donations starting as little as $25.00. And for any contribution as little $1.00, you will get updates up until the show.<br/></p>

Love is a powerful thing & making music is the thing that I love. 

If you asked me what was the most important aspect of my life, my answer would be Love. It’s something that’s always driven me, made me grow, and forced me to deal with what life throws my way. A huge part of that Love is what drives me consistently in creating music through songwriting, singing, & performing. It’s allowed me to be a storyteller through exposing the most vulnerable parts of myself in hopes of allowing others to feel connected & comfortable in doing the same while listening to my songs in their daily lives. 

I’m at new crossroads in my life where I am staring down two new directions: THE ROAD to the RIGHT will keep me self-producing and continuing to create but THE ROAD on the LEFT will allow me to take my music career to NEW HEIGHTS and that path on the left has something else standing there: YOU! YOU are a key component to everything I do musically. You push me to grow, you push me to listen, you push me to create something that comes from the deepest parts of my passion so that I can continue to spread that which we all need a lot more of - LOVE.

<p>I have been a musician all my life. I started singing when I was 5 years old singing classical until I was 12. After doing my grades In classical music I sang opera for two years until I converted to singing modern music. After school I studied at Brighton institute of modern music for two years doing a degree. I passed my audition to get in there at the age of 16 and started an early music degree at the age of 17. I have played piano for 10 years and guitar for 4 years. I am currently 20 years old. </p>
<p>I have played a lot of small time gigs and recorded a couple of songs professionally, but it is hard to afford. Music is my life, I have done it from such a young age and have always pursued it. I have always wanted recognition for the songs I write but when i was younger I did not think it would be so hard. Music is my passion and is something I have always wanted to pursue. I want to live doing something that I love and to write songs that don't just make me happy but also the people who want to listen.  Here is a Link to my band page ----&gt;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ElliotRoseMusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">El Jay Rose Music page</a></p>
<p>Donations would help massively no matter how much or how little. The donations would help me be able to afford the studio time to record my new album and promote it. It would help me be able to record six songs in the studio with full equipment and professional advice from the employees that work there. It would help also to promote my album and my band page on social sites giving people the opportunity to listen to my music. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I have In the past recorded one of my original songs in a professional studio, it did take a full day to get it recorded and cost £300, I recorded it at Tunbridge wells and have put a link to the song on my campaign as I have put it up on youtube ----&gt;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyp_FGupqrI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Devil in Disguise by El Jay Rose</a>. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">£1800 would be enough to record six songs in a professional studio which would take six days to edit and perfect. The extra £200 would go towards advertisement, promoting the album and band page. I could upload it to Itunes and send it into the BBC. For anyone who donates and want's one I will send them a copy of the Album when it's finish. I would like to record my album at a studio called ""RiverRun Studios"" In potton as its the closet studio to Biggleswade where I live. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am aware getting recognition is easier said than done. So I have been in touch with promoters and I am currently active on the gigging scene. I have a privet party gig on the 1st of august, a charity festival called ""Busk till Dusk"" on the 8th of august in Biggleswade for St Johns hospice, My name is on the listing in this link-&gt;<a href=""http://busktilldusk.wix.com/busktilldusk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BuskTillDusk Festival</a>. I have a privet Festival on the 30th of August and few pub gigs in my area also.  I am working hard to become a musician and to be recognised in my area and beyond by keeping in touch with venues and playing in front of a crowd at every chance I get.  I organise my own gigs also. </span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello, My names Elliot rose and I perform under the name of ""El Jay rose""
I have been a musician all my life. I started singing when I was 5 years old singing classical until I was 12. After doing my grades In classical music I sang opera for two years until I converted to singing modern music. After school I studied at Brighton institute of modern music for two years doing a degree. I passed my audition to get in there at the age of 16 and started an early music degree at the age of 17. I have played piano for 10 years and guitar for 4 years. I am currently 20 years old. 
I have played a lot of small time gigs and recorded a couple of songs professionally, but it is hard to afford. Music is my life, I have done it from such a young age and have always pursued it. I have always wanted recognition for the songs I write but when i was younger I did not think it would be so hard. Music is my passion and is something I have always wanted to pursue. I want to live doing something that I love and to write songs that don't just make me happy but also the people who want to listen.  Here is a Link to my band page ---->El Jay Rose Music page
Donations would help massively no matter how much or how little. The donations would help me be able to afford the studio time to record my new album and promote it. It would help me be able to record six songs in the studio with full equipment and professional advice from the employees that work there. It would help also to promote my album and my band page on social sites giving people the opportunity to listen to my music.    What We Need & What You Get I have In the past recorded one of my original songs in a professional studio, it did take a full day to get it recorded and cost £300, I recorded it at Tunbridge wells and have put a link to the song on my campaign as I have put it up on youtube ---->Devil in Disguise by El Jay Rose. £1800 would be enough to record six songs in a professional studio which would take six days to edit and perfect. The extra £200 would go towards advertisement, promoting the album and band page. I could upload it to Itunes and send it into the BBC. For anyone who donates and want's one I will send them a copy of the Album when it's finish. I would like to record my album at a studio called ""RiverRun Studios"" In potton as its the closet studio to Biggleswade where I live. 
I am aware getting recognition is easier said than done. So I have been in touch with promoters and I am currently active on the gigging scene. I have a privet party gig on the 1st of august, a charity festival called ""Busk till Dusk"" on the 8th of august in Biggleswade for St Johns hospice, My name is on the listing in this link->BuskTillDusk Festival. I have a privet Festival on the 30th of August and few pub gigs in my area also.  I am working hard to become a musician and to be recognised in my area and beyond by keeping in touch with venues and playing in front of a crowd at every chance I get.  I organise my own gigs also.

<p>Greg</p><p><b>BIOGRAPHY</b></p><p></p><p>An experienced improviser, composer, arranger and
teacher, <b>Greg Murphy</b> has led, directed and performed with various groups
around the world for the past three decades. In a 2015 review referencing “Brother,
Can You Spare a Dime?” from Greg’s CD, <i>Blues
for Miles</i>, Maxwell Chandler writes: “… not every musician can play the
blues. Greg displays an authenticity not in any specific blues-based structure
but in an organic soulfulness. There is a power to the performance deriving
from simplicity …. Tinged with melancholy but bearable on account of its
beauty, it is a rainy day with all the leaves of the trees dripping silvered
jewels.” He goes on: “‘Hat Trick’ is another original. It is free jazz not in
the genre sense but in the band allowing different components from several
genres to meld without concern of adhering to any specific formula …. A
dramatic cohesiveness is created not because all the musicians play in unison
but because each of the smaller patterns executed within the piece bolster the
others.” In another 2015 review of <i>Blues
for Miles</i>, Bob Rusch of Cadence Magazine writes “… a strong ensemble [with]
some very effective free playing on ‘Free Ur Mind’ and ‘Free Han Solo.’”</p>
<p>Greg began his musical adventures in 1971 when he
joined the Ray-Fisk Grammar School Band in Chicago. His classical studies began later
that year with Lucia Santini at Roosevelt
 University.  Between 1980 and 1984, he played with the
jazz/funk band Lightning Flash Thunder Roar, The University of Illinois at
Chicago Big Band, The Northern Illinois University Big Band, and other local Chicago bands.</p>
<p>A jazz study grant from the National Endowment for
the Arts in 1984 gave Greg the opportunity to go to New Orleans and study with the eminent
pianist and jazz educator, Ellis Marsalis. 
He remained there and began recording and performing with The New
Orleans Jazz Couriers, Percussion Incorporated, and his own group, The
Fusicians.  The Percussion Incorporated
album, <i>Drum Talk,</i> (Greg’s first recording) was recorded and released in
1987. While living in the crescent city, Greg performed with Donald Harrison,
Wynton Marsalis, and countless other great musicians.</p>
<p>Greg moved to New York in 1987 and began what had become a
long association with multi-directional drummer, Rashied Ali.  Greg performed and recorded with Ali and his
various groups throughout Europe, Canada,
the United States
and beyond, from 1987 until Rashied passed away in 2009.  </p>
<p>Throughout his career, Greg has performed in Japan, China and The Philippines with his
own trio and other groups. He’s also worked in New York
with Ornette Coleman and in France
with Carlos Santana and Archie Shepp. In 2012, Greg recorded the theme song
“Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?” for the HBO documentary <i>Redemption</i>, which was produced and directed by Jon Alpert and
Matthew O’Neill. <i>Redemption</i> received
a 2013 Academy Award nomination for best documentary short.</p>
<p>Greg also performed with Arthur Taylor, Branford
Marsalis, Joe Lovano, Grachan Moncur, III, Christian McBride, Flava Flav, Cindy
Blackman, Terrence Blanchard, Harry Connick, Jr., Charles McPherson, and James
Blood Ulmer, among many others.</p><p></p></div>","Hi, my name is

This is your opportunity to make a difference. To show the world that you don’t have to write a fluffy lyric to be successful. Take things back to when Michael Jackson spoke about things that mattered. Change the course being set for people that come after us and after them. If its gonna happen, its gotta happen now. </p><p>I’ve already sold over 6 million records with my previous band “The Moffatts” which was the most successful pop band to come out of Canada in the 90’s and early 2000’s.

This is a goal of mine and I am not about to give up now.</p><p>I believe this is a risk free project. I’ve made up my mind to make this happen and to not give up until it has, but there will be obstacles…and I like obstacles. Its the only time I learn anything…and I like learning.

Here's a bullet-point outline of prizes:5$ - A personal email saying thanks10$ - Your name on my wall of FAME!!!15$ - 3 songs from Ep before anyone else25$ - A thank you credit in Ep artwork plus 3 songs from Ep before anyone else50$ - Personal Skype thank you, credit in Ep artwork and first to receive complete new Ep150$ - Cook and have dinner over Skype, credit in Ep artwork, plus digital copies of previously unreleased material and first to receive complete new Ep300$ - Write a song with me via Skype with the possibility of making next Ep 500$ - Write a song with me via Skype with the possibility of making next Ep and receive professional recording of song1,000$ - Write a song with me via Skype with the possibility of making next Ep, get listed as executive producer of EP, collaborate on track list order and receive 1% royalty from sales of EpIf the goal isn’t reached then I’ll still use whatever is made. I’m not giving up on this and any help is appreciated. I don’t write songs just for the sake of writing songs. Its a very important experience and should be fun, but not taken for granted. Its a great way to communicate and inspire people. Even though being successful is an important thing to me, it doesn’t take precedence over the art form and that’s something that separates me from a lot of the artists today. This is your opportunity to make a difference. To show the world that you don’t have to write a fluffy lyric to be successful. Take things back to when Michael Jackson spoke about things that mattered. Change the course being set for people that come after us and after them. If its gonna happen, its gotta happen now. I’ve already sold over 6 million records with my previous band “The Moffatts” which was the most successful pop band to come out of Canada in the 90’s and early 2000’s. I’ve been nominated for numerous awards and have a track record for completing and doing my best on everything I do. This is a goal of mine and I am not about to give up now.I believe this is a risk free project. I’ve made up my mind to make this happen and to not give up until it has, but there will be obstacles…and I like obstacles. Its the only time I learn anything…and I like learning. They constantly test my character and intelligence. Please spread the word and help me get this music heard through social media and emails.  Share, share, share if you can. That’s ultimately the most important part. If you can’t help financially, anything will work. Thanks for taking the time, cause I know there’s always something else to do. Scott",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>THE PROBLEMS</i></p>
<p>The “Elephant-in-the-Room"" Investor Risks
and Challenges that we face are questions of Revenue.  If
the only Revenue is from Streaming, that could be a problem. The ""Music for SuperFans™ 
PAYING ARTISTS<b>. <i>FIRST</i>!™</b><b> Promise</b>"" requires the $21 monthly in order: </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>for Artists to sleep indoors &amp; eat </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>to cover direct &amp; operating costs of fueling Our Marketing
Engine, and</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>to address typical costs of doing business</p>
<p>The market is 280 Million global households.  If the only Revenue is streaming, then we would
need to win 70% of the streaming market.</p>

<p><i>THE SOLUTIONS:
<b><span>SuperFans™ </span></b>&amp; More</i></p>
<p><i>Now, in this
fast emerging NEW MUSIC INDUSTRY, <b><span>SuperFans™</span></b> are the marketers, preaching the gospel
of Artists to potential new fans. </i>Though <b><i><span>SuperFans™ </span></i></b>make up just 14% of
streaming consumers, they drive 34% of market sales. They spend between $250
and $2,500 each annually in support of their Artist. <b><i>SuperFans™</i></b> are the
bosses who now control and drive the New Music Industry.</p>
<p>Additionally, 70% market
share is not needed, because mwseq™ has over a <i>DOZEN</i> varied Revenue
Streams to assure the Artrepreneur™ earnings. The 12<sup>+</sup> Streams are
the equivalent of bringing a nuclear warhead to a knife fight and don’t want to
tip off competitors. The diverse Revenue Streams win access to the developed 2Billion
Global Market, as well as the unexplored explosive impact of Billions of
prospects in fast developing third world markets. All
12<sup>+</sup> of our Revenue Streams is too much information to try and
abbreviate here so we merely discuss the Streaming.</p>
<p>What are other solutions?
mwseq™ represents a Rare Convergence of Skills. We possess Entrepreneurial
Excellence; Performance Art Distinction; and, I. T. Professionalism.</p>

THE PROBLEMS
The “Elephant-in-the-Room"" Investor Risks
and Challenges that we face are questions of Revenue.  If
the only Revenue is from Streaming, that could be a problem. The ""Music for SuperFans™ 
PAYING ARTISTS. FIRST!™ Promise"" requires the $21 monthly in order: 
• 
for Artists to sleep indoors & eat 
• 
to cover direct & operating costs of fueling Our Marketing
Engine, and
• 
to address typical costs of doing business
The market is 280 Million global households.  If the only Revenue is streaming, then we would
need to win 70% of the streaming market.

THE SOLUTIONS:
SuperFans™ & More
Now, in this
fast emerging NEW MUSIC INDUSTRY, SuperFans™ are the marketers, preaching the gospel
of Artists to potential new fans. Though SuperFans™ make up just 14% of
streaming consumers, they drive 34% of market sales. They spend between $250
and $2,500 each annually in support of their Artist. SuperFans™ are the
bosses who now control and drive the New Music Industry.
Additionally, 70% market
share is not needed, because mwseq™ has over a DOZEN varied Revenue
Streams to assure the Artrepreneur™ earnings. The 12+ Streams are
the equivalent of bringing a nuclear warhead to a knife fight and don’t want to
tip off competitors. The diverse Revenue Streams win access to the developed 2Billion
Global Market, as well as the unexplored explosive impact of Billions of
prospects in fast developing third world markets. All
12+ of our Revenue Streams is too much information to try and
abbreviate here so we merely discuss the Streaming.
What are other solutions?
mwseq™ represents a Rare Convergence of Skills. We possess Entrepreneurial
Excellence; Performance Art Distinction; and, I. T. Professionalism.

<p>Aaaahhhh, but the power and delight of the Bhakti path!  </p>
<p>Little did I know how seven years ago, this path would pick me up and set me back down in a completely new and magnificent direction.  From the moment I magically discovered a flyer for the very first BhaktiFest in my car, my soul’s calling began to unfold.  I will never forget my heart opening tears which literally brought me to my knees, being amongst so many beautiful like-minded souls, all singing and dancing our hearts out to the Mother.  From then on, I could not envision a life without singing the Divine Names, yet Kirtan offerings at this time were beyond minimal in Sedona.  Wondering if this would mean that I might have to move back to California, I had a sudden realization that I could instead be bringing Kirtan to Sedona.  If through my events, even one person felt a tremendous heart-opening like I had, my dharma would have felt realized.  I was on a mantra mission and thus Bhakti Tribe Sedona was born.  </p>
<p>After a time, I was surprised to feel my heart burn with love every time I thought about the harmonium.  It was clear to me that my soul was calling me to play this deeply soul-stirring instrument. I decided to sign up for my first Kirtan camp with my most beloved Kirtan artist, Jai Uttal. Harmonium in hand, I bravely yet shakily faced that terrifying first time leading Kirtan at that retreat!  My intent was to develop my own personal chanting practice, immersing myself deeper into this sweet nectar of devotion.  Then, about a year later, I heard whisperings that it was time to expand beyond my personal practice.   </p>
<p>And thus Sanjali Kirtan was birthed.</p>
<p>Prior to BhaktiFest, if anyone had told me that I was going to be singing in public regularly and was going to record a CD, I probably would have laughed them out the door.  Yet, here I am, offering Kirtan on a regular basis and bringing devotional chanting and teachings about the deities to yoga classes.  This has been soul-fulfilling beyond measure and now I am hearing the divine whisperings that a CD is asking to be born.  </p>
<p>I come before you, asking for your financial generosity in order to embark on the recording, mixing, mastering, printing and packaging of my first CD, bringing forth the songs of my heart.</p>
<p>My eternal gratitude to each and every one of you who is so great-heartedly choosing to support this divinely guided project. </p>

<h1>The Youth Orchestra
Napolinova</h1>
<p>In
<b>March 2014</b> the conductor<b> Mariano Patti </b>and I decided to make our dream come
true: to create a young high level orchestra in Naples. This in order to
provide many young talents with the opportunity to express and reach their
professional aims. </p>
<p><b>Musicians are the key players in this project.</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">At that time we had no guarantees; we only
had our music experience with us and were conscious of the </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">troubles we’d face</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">.</span><br/></p>
<p><i>To realize this dream the first step was to hold ""regular auditions"" with a high level jury which selected young people from across Italy.</i><br/></p>
<p>At last, in
<b>November 2014</b>, we realized our first event with <b>great success</b>. Then, we also
understood that we could trust our young people’s desire of <b>self-assertion</b> and
that many other people, not necessarily musicians, wanted to be part of and
share a project <b>beyond the music</b>.</p>

<p>Much has been
done during the past first year, thanks to the orchestra people’s involvement
and support.</p>
<p>The young
musicians have chosen to join and share the dream, and all together we have
developed several very important events.</p>
<p><b>People’s</b> great

<p>Due to their

many Italian distinguished musicians.</p>

<br/>
<p>and, lastly, thanks to the collaboration of <b>Antonio
Pompa-Baldi, the world-famous pianist and professor at the University of
Cleveland</b>,  the orchestra has taken part, as a guest, at the festival “Todi
International Music Master” (TIMM). Here the orchestra young musicians have
collaborated with very famous teachers coming from the most important American
universities, and have collaborated with young pianists coming from all over the
world (China, Japan, USA, Sweden).</p>

<p><b>Antonio

<h3>Risks and opportunities</h3>
<p>Nowadays
classical music goes through a critical phase for many reasons we don’t want to
list.</p>
<p>We <b>have chosen
to build</b> a future for this world heritage and for many young people who devote
their entire life to the classical music.</p>
<p>Here and now
this task can cross the national boundaries and that’s why we address all those
people from<b> all over the world</b> who really feel this common desire.</p>
<p><b>Music connects people</b>
and makes distance null: so you can join in the project and play a key role
even if you are thousand kilometers far.</p>

</div></div>","L'Orchestra Giovanile Napolinova 
Marzo 2014, Il Maestro Mariano Patti ed io abbiamo deciso di trasformare il ”sogno” di creare a Napoli un’orchestra giovanile di alto livello. Un'orchestra che si ponesse come fine il dare ai tanti giovani talenti la possibilità di realizzare le proprie aspirazioni e sviluppare la propria professionalità. Un progetto in cui sarebbero stati il “fine” e non il “mezzo”.In quella data non eravamo certi di nulla, se non della nostra esperienza nel mondo musicale e nelle sue problematiche. Eravamo coscienti delle difficoltà che avremmo incontrato. Per realizzare questo sogno il primo passo è stato quello di indire “regolari audizioni” con una commissione di alto livello che ha selezionato giovani provenienti da tutta Italia.Novembre 2014, finalmente siamo riusciti a realizzare con grande successo il nostro primo evento. Li abbiamo anche capito che potevamo contare sulla voglia dei giovani di trovare il loro spazio e sulla voglia di tanti, musicisti ma anche persone dalle più disparate professionalità, di partecipare e contribuire ad un progetto che andava oltre la musica.Clicca per ascoltare: Mozart: Sinf. in La Magg. K 201 n. 29In questo primo anno di vita, grazie all'impegno qualitativo e professionale dei ragazzi abbiamo già realizzato tanto.I ragazzi hanno condiviso e scelto di investire in questo sogno e siamo riusciti, senza nessun aiuto, a realizzare una serie di eventi di grande spessore. Le persone ci hanno dato grande supporto, riuscendo a metterci subito in luce come una realtà nuova, non solo nei presupposti. La loro spinta ci ha permesso di emergere inserendoci in rassegne di alto profilo al fianco di prestigiosi nomi del concertismo italiano.Siamo stati invitati con grande successo al “Moz’art Box” 2015abbiamo inaugurato lo scorso luglio la XVIII edizione della rassegna “I Concerti di Villa Guariglia” 
e, infine, grazie alla collaborazione di Antonio Pompa-Baldi, pianista di fama mondiale e docente alla Cleveland University abbiamo partecipato come orchestra ospite al TIMM (Todi International Music Master), Festival internazionale, dove i giovani strumentisti dell’Orchestra hanno potuto collaborare con alcuni dei più famosi docenti delle più importanti università americane, suonando con giovani pianisti provenienti da tutto il mondo (Cina, Giappone, USA, Svezia).Antonio Pompa-Baldi ha creduto e investito con noi nel progetto dando all'Orchestra una grande opportunità, speriamo che anche voi abbiate la stessa voglia di contribuire e investire su questi ragazzi. 
qui il link al tributo ricevuto a todi 
https://www.facebook.com/alfredodepascale62/videos/395762387289685/Cosa vogliamo realizzareProssimo passo nella costruzione di questo sogno è la produzione di una prima stagione concertistica stabile da gennaio a maggio, con produzioni mensili che, oltre a Napoli, saranno proposte in altri importanti centri della Campania.Il goal è riuscire a fare 14 concerti.
Ancora una volta la nostra “follia” ha trovato supporto in tanti artisti di fama internazionale, pronti a contribuire alla nostra prima stagione.
Tra questi Felice Cusano, docente e solista di fama internazionale, che ha creato tanti dei più importanti violinisti italiani e preparato le più importanti Orchestre Giovanili Italiane, il fagottista Francesco Bossone, solista dell’Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, che collaborerà da solista e direttore, mettendo al servizio dei giovani la sua bravura e la sua esperienza, il violista Raffaele Mallozzi, anch’egli solista dell’Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, i pianisti Orazio Maione e Alexander Hintchev, il violinista Franco Mezzena, concertista di fama internazionale, il violoncellista Ilie Ionescu, primo violoncello dell’Orchestra del Teatro San Carlo e solista di fama, l’oboista Fabio D’Onofrio, solista dei Wiener Akademie e tra i più bravi oboisti italiani.La lista di quelli che hanno dato la loro gratuita disponibilità potrebbe continuare a lungo, ma vogliamo che anche tu, ascoltando le parole dei nostri giovani, ascoltando su Youtube le performance e leggendo le recensioni abbia voglia di far parte di questo sogno. clicca per ascoltare: Tchaikovsky Serenata opera 48 per archiChe tu sia un musicista, un appassionato o anche una persona lontana dal mondo musicale ma amante del bello. Credere che la passione e la volontà possano far nascere progetti ""impossibili"" e che il futuro sia nelle mani di tutti noi.Oggi siamo in una delle fasi più critiche per il mondo della musica classica, per mille motivi che non sto qui ad elencare. Dare un futuro a questo patrimonio dell’umanità e a tutti quei ragazzi che, ancora oggi, nella musica classica investono la loro vita è la nostra scelta.Questo impegno, oggi nell'era della globalizzazione, puo' superare i confini nazionali e noi, proprio per questo, ci rivolgiamo a tutti coloro che, di qualsiasi nazione siano, si sentano uniti da questo comune ideale, che vada oltre la musica e sia nella passione e nella voglia di costruire qualcosa con le proprie forze.Anche se distante migliaia di chilometri da noi, puoi essere partecipe e protagonista del progetto. La musica unisce ed azzera le distanze. clicca per ascoltare: Elgar ""Serenata"" opera 20
Perchè il crowdfunding
Fino ad oggi i ragazzi hanno investito il loro tempo, noi le nostre poche risorse per sviluppare tutto quanto hai visto nell'anno appena trascorso, Grazie al contributo alcuni nostri appassionati amici l'Orchestra è stata ""adottata"" per qualche concerto nella scorsa stagione.Preparare un concerto richiede tante ore di studio e luoghi adeguati per provare. I maggiori costi che dovremo sostenere sono:
Rimborso spese per i ragazzi durante le prove

Rimborso spese di viaggio e pernottamento per i solisti invitati

The Youth Orchestra
Napolinova
In
March 2014 the conductor Mariano Patti and I decided to make our dream come
true: to create a young high level orchestra in Naples. This in order to
provide many young talents with the opportunity to express and reach their
professional aims. 
Musicians are the key players in this project.
At that time we had no guarantees; we only
had our music experience with us and were conscious of the troubles we’d face.
To realize this dream the first step was to hold ""regular auditions"" with a high level jury which selected young people from across Italy.
At last, in
November 2014, we realized our first event with great success. Then, we also
understood that we could trust our young people’s desire of self-assertion and
that many other people, not necessarily musicians, wanted to be part of and
share a project beyond the music.

Click to play: Mozart: Sinf. in La Magg. K 201 n. 29
Much has been
done during the past first year, thanks to the orchestra people’s involvement
and support.
The young
musicians have chosen to join and share the dream, and all together we have
developed several very important events.
People’s great
support has highlighted the orchestra as a really new entity.


Due to their
drive, the orchestra has been invited in high-profile festivals, together with
many Italian distinguished musicians.


In 2015 we have
been invited at the ""Moz'art Box"" and performed with great success. 

In July we opened the eighteenth edition of ""The Concerts at Villa
Guariglia"" 



and, lastly, thanks to the collaboration of Antonio
Pompa-Baldi, the world-famous pianist and professor at the University of
Cleveland,  the orchestra has taken part, as a guest, at the festival “Todi
International Music Master” (TIMM). Here the orchestra young musicians have
collaborated with very famous teachers coming from the most important American
universities, and have collaborated with young pianists coming from all over the
world (China, Japan, USA, Sweden).

Antonio
Pompa-Baldi has believed and invested with us in the project giving the
orchestra a great opportunity. We hope that you also have the same desire to
contribute and invest in these youngsters.

Here is the
link to the tribute received in Todi
https://www.facebook.com/alfredodepascale62/videos/395762387289685/

Which is
our goal?
Our next step is
to develop of a concert season between January and May 2016: monthly events
will be presented in Naples and in other important sites in Campania.
Producing 14
concerts is our target.
Once again many
world famous artists have been prompt to give their contribution to our “folly”.
Among these, Felice Cusano, soloist and teacher of
the best Italian violinists, who has trained the most important Italian
orchestras; the bassoonist Francesco
Bossone, soloist of the “Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia”, will
cooperate as an experienced and skilled soloist and conductor; the violinist Raffaele Mallozzi, from the “Accademia
Nazionale di Santa Cecilia” as well; the pianists Orazio Maione and Alexander
Hintchev, the violinist Franco
Mezzena; Ilie Ionescu, the first
cellist (and soloist) of the “Orchestra del Teatro San Carlo”; the oboist Fabio D’Onofrio, soloist of the “Wiener
Akademie”.

The list could
be long, but we wish you really want to join this dream, after listening to our
young musicians and to the orchestra’s performance on YouTube, and reading the
concert reviews. 
And this,
whether you are a musician or only keen on music, or even a person simply
looking for beauty.
We believe that
passion and will can result in “impossible” projects and that the future is in
in our own hands.




Risks and opportunities
Nowadays
classical music goes through a critical phase for many reasons we don’t want to
list.
We have chosen
to build a future for this world heritage and for many young people who devote
their entire life to the classical music.
Here and now
this task can cross the national boundaries and that’s why we address all those
people from all over the world who really feel this common desire.
Music connects people
and makes distance null: so you can join in the project and play a key role
even if you are thousand kilometers far.
here you can listen us play Elgar



Why crowdfunding
Up to now we and
the orchestra young musicians have been investing time and resources to develop
last year’s events. 
Some
enthusiastic friends have granted several concerts in the past season, thus
“adopting” the Orchestra.
A concert setup
is very demanding in terms of study hours and proper rehearsal locations for
the rehearsals.
The main
expenses are:
- 
refunding musicians’ rehearsals;
- 
refunding musicians’ travel and
overnight stay;
- 
publishing and distributing
informative for the concerts;
With your help
we want a really stable concert season for the orchestra young musicians.
We have many
rewards to thank you. Scroll the bar on the right to make your choice.
Join us in this dream
and help us to realize the first concert season.
We wish to thank you for the attention.

Night Visitors to the Jersey City community for the very first time! December 20th, 2015  at St. Paul's Lutheran Church, Jersey City

Meet Amahl. A 12
year old boy who prefers to play his flute than do his chores, who sometimes
gets himself into trouble and doesn’t always listen to his mother. He is a boy with
a special gift and his life will be changed by 3 special visitors.
Meet Alexi. A 12
year old boy who lives in Jersey City, attends 7th Grade, plays
basketball, doesn’t care for homework all that much, enjoys his video games,
in many ways just an ordinary boy. He is also a boy who loves to sing.
Alexi has been getting to know Amahl.He would like to share with you Amahl’s beautiful
story.
***

FIRST STEP GOAL: $12,000 This is the minimum we need to put on this production. This amount will pay 80% of
production costs, including a cast of professional opera singers from Kyrenia
Opera, stage director, conductor, chorus, dancer, dance choreographer and piano
accompaniment.  Balance of 20% is being matched by a private sponsor upon
meeting our first step goal.
FULL SUCCESS GOAL: $20,000
Anything we
raise above our first step goal will go towards the
hiring of an instrumental ensemble. The full
success goal of $20,000 will enable us to have a full orchestra!
***Kyrenia Opera’s semi-staged production will feature
professional opera singers and dancers, as well as our homegrown Jersey City
boy Alexi Horne. But what’s a children’s opera without plenty of children? So, this unique production will also offer an interactive
component: children from the Jersey City community who love to sing and dance will participate in the opera!  (Inquiries may be sent to AmahlJerseyCity2015@gmail.com)
We can all relate to the heartwarming, compassionate
tale of Amahl and the Night Visitors,
the beloved short one-act opera by Gian Carlo Menotti. Whether we celebrate
Christmas or not, the characters are still alive today in all of us:     anguished,
loving mothers and fathers,     mischievous but
brave young sons and daughters,     communities dancing
and feasting joyfully even in the face of adversity,     and leaders
in pursuit of their mission guided by wisdom, compassion and truth.The warm, intimate setting of historic St. Paul’s
Lutheran Church in urban, diverse Jersey City is the ideal place to nourish
ourselves with the simple truths and timeless values found in the story of Amahl and the Night Visitors.
Please contribute at any level that you can.And most of all, don’t miss this truly special event! Tickets are also available for $35 at http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2461185

Love” Community-Outreach Program

<p>Hi, I’m Paige Clem and I AM FREAKIN’ HAPPY that I am finally
going to go into the studio and record my original music. To give you an idea
of how long I’ve wanted to do this, above is a photo of the top of my actual
bucket list that I made some time in my late teens. Even then, the driving
force in my life was music....long before I could even comfortably call myself
a musician. </p>
<p>You'll see that it's been over 20 years now since I first
got on stage and performed in front of a crowd—I'll never forget that night at
the War Eagle Supper Club in Auburn, AL and how my knees were knocking so hard
I had to sit on a stool to make it through the song. You can also see that
since that same time, I've wanted to record my own music (piano at the time
because I didn't even play guitar back then!).  You'll also note that 20
years later, that top-of-the-list item is yet to be crossed off. I have since
skinny dipped, had a kid, ridden a motorcycle, seen the Grand Canyon, gotten a
tattoo and a whole lot more from that list--but I still haven't recorded my
music. </p>
<p>Until now! </p>
<p><b>What
I Need</b></p>
<p>I need your help raising the funds
to make this happen so I can finally cross that baby off the list!<span>  In all seriousness, it’s there for a reason—I
don’t think our desires come to us by mistake. This needs to get done so let’s
do it! </span></p>
<p>I’d like to raise $14,000 for this
project. Hopefully my video gives a pretty good explanation of why something
like this costs so much, but to further elaborate, here’s a rough breakdown of where
the bread is all going to go:</p>

<b>Tradition. </b><b>It's all about tradition. </b>Throughout the years as a working singer-songwriter I've learned so much about the craft of songwriting by learning the songs of the artists that I love... like <b>Paul Simon, James Taylor and many other artists from the 1960's and 1970's, up until now</b>. So, carrying on the <b>traditions, values, and belief systems</b> of those artists that I love and respect is something very important to me.

<h2>What You Can Do:</h2>
<br/><h3>Make a contribution now </h3>
<p>I need your help. I am an independent musician and I do all of this stuff myself. I don't have a record label or a management company or anyone to help me get my music out into the world... <b>except you!<br/></b><br/>You are the reason that I've had the success that I have had so far.  And when you support my crowdfunding campaigns like this you are directly helping me get the cd done, released, and out into this world. <br/><br/>So, if you believe in the power of this music, what it means, and what it can do in the world... I need you to contribute right now, if you can.<br/><br/><b>All amounts are greatly appreciated </b>and I've tried to set it up so that anyone can be involved if they'd like to.<br/><br/>And of course I will really appreciate you for getting involved and being such a huge supporter of my music, my life as a working musician, and the purpose of all of these great artists' songs.<br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/>Where the money is going:</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Where the money goes...</p>
<p>So primarily the money generated in this campaign will go to...</p>
<p>I. Album Productions Costs - $10,000 <br/>   A. Mixing engineer fees <br/>   B. Mastering studio fees <br/>   C. Graphic designer fees<br/>   D. CD duplication costs <br/>   E. Shipping and handling fees <br/>   F. etc...</p>
<p>But will also go to...</p>
<p>II. Marketing - $3,500 <br/>   A. Internet advertising to get the new album out there! <br/>      1. Facebook Advertising, Twitter, Youtube, etc.. <br/>      2. Internet Radio Advertising - Pandora, Spotify, etc.. <br/>   B. New videos made for the new songs!</p>
<p>III. Tour Support - $1,500 <br/>   A. Vehicle Maintenance (my van)<br/>   B. Equipment Maintenance <br/></p>
<p><br/>Honestly, just by contributing to this campaign you're relieving me of a whole lot of financial stress and I'll love you forever for doing it. Thanks for reading this far down. <br/>sincerely, <br/>-Kev</p>
<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>

Hey, it's Kev!
Tradition. It's all about tradition. Throughout the years as a working singer-songwriter I've learned so much about the craft of songwriting by learning the songs of the artists that I love... like Paul Simon, James Taylor and many other artists from the 1960's and 1970's, up until now. So, carrying on the traditions, values, and belief systems of those artists that I love and respect is something very important to me. And I keep that in mind in almost everything that I do...
About this project:
I've chosen some of my favorite songs from my favorite artists and recorded them as acoustic songs to highlight them in a new and intimate way.  It's really quite fun because it brings out a lot of the different features and meanings of each song. And in this indiegogo campaign I'm inviting you to join me on this awesome new journey! 


AWESOME REWARDS:

Autographed Poster/Bonus CD Package - NEW!



I just went through my closet and found these awesome 11 x 17 full color posters that are from my ""Hi Love"" album tour.  And I've decided to add them here as a perk. In addition, you get a signed BONUS CD, ""Hi Love"" which is my most popular cd. Both are signed directly to you (and you get a sticker from that tour too). Also includes Advance Autographed New CD and Album Download.Limited Edition Hoodie Package - Designed by Steve Johannsen




INCLUDES: Limited Edition Hoodie, Advance Autographed CD, and Album Download.  Check out this killer new Hoodie package designed by Illustrator Steve Johannsen. Steve has done artwork for the Grateful Dead, Allman Brothers Band, Gov't Mule and a slew of other amazing, timeless bands and truthfully I feel honored he has done this new artwork for me.  He is the man and I am lucky he's involved with this project. More about Steve and the artwork below.  Pictures above show front and back print on hoodie. Hooded sweatshirt is available in many sizes and comfortably fits both men and women.Your Name On My New CD Insert Package

Your Own Signed Acoustic Guitar Package



INCLUDES: This amazing Yamaha FG 700S acoustic guitar signed, Your Name on My New CD Insert, Limited Edition Hoodie, Advance Autographed CD, and Album DownloadSo, I went down to my local music store and played one of these bad boys to make sure it was a quality guitar. And ABSOLUTELY it is! I really dig it and it reminds me so much of my first acoustic guitar ever. I was only 16 years old and played my Yamaha acoustic everyday after school until I could no longer concentrate. It is a quality guitar for every level of player and trust me, I've played a lot of guitars. And I'll be more than happy to personally sign yours if you'd like me to. My personal time with my instruments is like meditation to me, so if you get this guitar perhaps it can be that for you too.Private Benefactor Package

<h3>Join The Occultists Family</h3>
<p>Emerging from the darkness we’ve found the light, a
conscious and spiritual movement of esoteric knowledge and techno music.  We are Occultists and we are here to spread
ancient teachings through dance, music, culture and magic. Occultists is a
techno brand created by James Demon, who always dreamed as a young child of the
night to merge his love for the occult and techno into one entity in the form
of a record label. Mixing elements of gothic and techno together into a brand of witch
techno that will undeniably be dance floor music for the Occultist in all of
us. The label will feature artists who will emerge 
from the shadows bringing us to a higher state of being through music 
and esoteric knowledge<br/></p>
<p>Searching out artists far and wide that matched his
vision for the first release he eventually stumbled upon Montreal based producer and vocalist Dugong. He
instantly fell in love with her one of kind style of dark minimalistic rhythms
with spiritually in-depth lyrics that speak to the audience and capture them in
its spell. Occultists is proud to present Dugong's Dead Man Rising EP. <br/></p>
<p>We've chosen a special 12"" vinyl release that will feature Dead Man Rising and Weak &amp; Powerless with two vinyl only remixes from other names in the world of electronic music. Woebegone Revisted, The Evil Magician, &amp; What May Come will be featured on an extended digital release that will follow the vinyl release next year. The extended release will also feature two other remixes that won't be featured on the vinyl. <br/></p>

<p>The cost of producing vinyl in the current market is quite expensive and this doesn't even include artwork, press for artists, remix fees etc. It's also very important to us that everyone involved and the artists themselves are receiving some kind of compensation for their art and hard work.

<p>We've created a campaign goal that will help get the first two releases off the ground. The second release will be a various artists compilation featuring some of our future artists and Dugong herself titled Book Of Shadows: Various Spells but more on that later. I've chosen a flexible campaign just in case we only fund half we can still do the first release. The release will come out digitally next year regardless of the campaign output but let's just face it vinyl is more fun!<br/></p>We've created a basic tier of perks where you can pre-order the digital or vinyl release plus shipping for advanced release. This means you'd get them before they hit your favorite online and physical record shops. The higher tiers offer you a hand in being a permanent part of the Occultists family by giving you all releases on digital, vinyl, or both for life. We also have our highest perk which will include receiving all the Occultists merchandise we plan to incorporate including our Occultists tarot card deck that is in the works.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447255046/dqg7ojofnntdqxux9ho5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div><h2><span><b>‘Who You Were’ and Who We Can Be</b></span></h2><br/><p>On the heels of my fourth album, With or Without (2014), I am bringing a new album to life for 2016 called Who You Were. I hit several benchmarks over the past year, including reaching into the hundreds of thousands of streams on sites like Pandora, Spotify, Apple Music, as well as steadily increasing airplay on terrestrial and indie stations.  My fan base has been growing exponentially and the timing is right to release what I hope to be my breakout album.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F149528524&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F149528524&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F548763060_295x166.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><br/><p>2015 has been a very busy year.  In addition to a steady stream of accolades and radio play from places as far as the UK and New Zealand, I also earned a spot in the Songwriter Hall of Fame, appeared on season 9 of NBC’s The Voice, logged tours on both coasts, and signed an exclusive music licensing deal with Platform Music Group. All of this came from a year of hard work and one album that changed the way I see music. I am continuing down that path with my next release and I need your help to do it. With or Without wasn’t a breakout album, but it has put me in a position to have one.</p><br/><p>Who You Were was born out of songs that weren’t finished in time to make it onto With or Without and the intense experiences of the last two years. With the band and talent behind With or Without we are taking the songwriting and performance to the next level that will hopefully deliver commercial success. My career has been 20 years in the making, and I feel like I am at the top of my craft and I want to share what I have learned with the world. This business is about momentum and striking while the iron is hot. This is my moment to shine, but I need your help to do it. </p><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><br/><p>I am looking for a partnership, not a scholarship. I am trying to raise the funds to finish recording and to properly promote my next record. There are the obvious recording and pressing costs associated with making an album, but there is much more to making a record successful than recording good tunes and printing albums. A hard truth about the music world today is that it takes money to get in front of people. From having to pay to promote your music on social media to paying to have your music played on the radio, at the end of the day it comes down to dollars. In the past I have never had a budget for promotion and because of that all of my albums have been ’slow burners’, where they actually sell more and more as the years go on because new fans find me and have never heard of them before. My goal with Who You Were is to change that paradigm and to use this album to throw myself into the spotlight. All of you can help by sharing through social media, but my hope is that some of you will be able to help financially as well.</p><br/><p>I am hoping to raise at least $15k. Of that money $5k will be spent on recording cost and album pressing (I will be matching that number personally), and the remaining $10k will go towards a publicity firm, online radio promotion, a high quality music video, and the creation of social media campaigns to get the music into as many ears as possible. We will also be using a small part of the funds raised to submit songs from the album for award consideration and showcases at festivals and conferences to help build notoriety quickly. I believe that the music will speak for itself, I just need people to hear it.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448037452/wcx8od5zxpdhaigpn4mn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Some of the unique perks that are available for your contributions include original artwork, chord charts and lyrics to the album, songwriting mentorship sessions, and VIP tickets to exclusive live shows including a live video recording at Ex’pression College in Emeryville, CA. If we don’t make it to the $10k mark the funds raised will still go to the promotion of the album and will be prioritized into publicity, radio promotion, and social media. If we are able to exceed the goal, we will use the funds to extend the time of the promotions and to create more music videos and farther reaching social media campaigns. </p><br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><br/><p>The timing is right and the music is the best that I have ever made. Momentum is the name of the game in the modern world and momentum is on my side. I can feel the wave building and you can be a part of seeing it crest. If you are a fan of my music, this is the most effective way to help me reach a dramatically larger audience with the best music that I have produced to date. Independent artists like myself have been changing our culture’s musical conversation in unprecedented ways in recent years. I want to add my voice of self-reliance, personal growth, joy, and love to that conversation. I honestly feel like I make music that can make people’s lives better, and if I have done that for one person, I can do it for a million. </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F150293085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F150293085&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F549731641_295x166.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p>By pledging to this campaign you will be adding your voice to mine in the effort to put real music— played by real people in a completely honest way—back into the popular conscience.

I confront the harsh edges of the world around me and I overcome, then I sit down with a guitar and a piece of paper and I tell people how I did it (hopefully in a way that doesn’t feel like I am preaching to them).

</ul><p></p></div>","‘Who You Were’ and Who We Can BeOn the heels of my fourth album, With or Without (2014), I am bringing a new album to life for 2016 called Who You Were. I hit several benchmarks over the past year, including reaching into the hundreds of thousands of streams on sites like Pandora, Spotify, Apple Music, as well as steadily increasing airplay on terrestrial and indie stations.  My fan base has been growing exponentially and the timing is right to release what I hope to be my breakout album.2015 has been a very busy year.  In addition to a steady stream of accolades and radio play from places as far as the UK and New Zealand, I also earned a spot in the Songwriter Hall of Fame, appeared on season 9 of NBC’s The Voice, logged tours on both coasts, and signed an exclusive music licensing deal with Platform Music Group. All of this came from a year of hard work and one album that changed the way I see music. I am continuing down that path with my next release and I need your help to do it. With or Without wasn’t a breakout album, but it has put me in a position to have one.Who You Were was born out of songs that weren’t finished in time to make it onto With or Without and the intense experiences of the last two years. With the band and talent behind With or Without we are taking the songwriting and performance to the next level that will hopefully deliver commercial success. My career has been 20 years in the making, and I feel like I am at the top of my craft and I want to share what I have learned with the world. This business is about momentum and striking while the iron is hot. This is my moment to shine, but I need your help to do it. What We Need & What You GetI am looking for a partnership, not a scholarship. I am trying to raise the funds to finish recording and to properly promote my next record. There are the obvious recording and pressing costs associated with making an album, but there is much more to making a record successful than recording good tunes and printing albums. A hard truth about the music world today is that it takes money to get in front of people. From having to pay to promote your music on social media to paying to have your music played on the radio, at the end of the day it comes down to dollars. In the past I have never had a budget for promotion and because of that all of my albums have been ’slow burners’, where they actually sell more and more as the years go on because new fans find me and have never heard of them before. My goal with Who You Were is to change that paradigm and to use this album to throw myself into the spotlight. All of you can help by sharing through social media, but my hope is that some of you will be able to help financially as well.I am hoping to raise at least $15k. Of that money $5k will be spent on recording cost and album pressing (I will be matching that number personally), and the remaining $10k will go towards a publicity firm, online radio promotion, a high quality music video, and the creation of social media campaigns to get the music into as many ears as possible. We will also be using a small part of the funds raised to submit songs from the album for award consideration and showcases at festivals and conferences to help build notoriety quickly. I believe that the music will speak for itself, I just need people to hear it.Some of the unique perks that are available for your contributions include original artwork, chord charts and lyrics to the album, songwriting mentorship sessions, and VIP tickets to exclusive live shows including a live video recording at Ex’pression College in Emeryville, CA. If we don’t make it to the $10k mark the funds raised will still go to the promotion of the album and will be prioritized into publicity, radio promotion, and social media. If we are able to exceed the goal, we will use the funds to extend the time of the promotions and to create more music videos and farther reaching social media campaigns. The ImpactThe timing is right and the music is the best that I have ever made. Momentum is the name of the game in the modern world and momentum is on my side. I can feel the wave building and you can be a part of seeing it crest. If you are a fan of my music, this is the most effective way to help me reach a dramatically larger audience with the best music that I have produced to date. Independent artists like myself have been changing our culture’s musical conversation in unprecedented ways in recent years. I want to add my voice of self-reliance, personal growth, joy, and love to that conversation. I honestly feel like I make music that can make people’s lives better, and if I have done that for one person, I can do it for a million.

I have been waiting on the Lord for all my life just to see and live in His almighty power through songs, preaching, prayer ... For sure God has been faithful to me in all my ways even though I wasn't totally obedient to His word  and messing up all the time, but He didn't forsake, He didn't deny me. He keeps calling me His son and proving His love to me wherever I stand, knowing that God  chose me and gave to me a big mission to accomplish in the world. I have come to the point of realizing that everything I have from Him must be freely given away.<p>In order to allow every gift to perform He has chose to give me some revelation, words, and prophecy to be able to share them with the world. However, I kept using some excuses just to run away from His calling. Then, He told me to be strong and courageous, to fear not, and to not be dismayed. Arise and work! (1 Chronicles 22:11-16) <br/></p>
<p>My album will be just the start of God's calling in my life to bring people into His presence and minister his love to the nations. The Lord has seen my heart, my courage, and my desire to stand and reach the nations. So now I am allowing Him to do more than what I expect. <br/><br/>The album will feature 10 songs in 5 languages: English, French, Swahili, Lingala, Kiluba. I have chose to use all these languages in the way of being thankful for whatever He has gave me to be used for His glory.<br/><br/>After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could 
number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, 
standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, 
with palm branches in their hands. (Revelation 7:9)<br/><br/>I bring a unique personal and global perspective on worship that is global, freeing, authentic, and uniting.<br/></p>
<p>For investing in this mission, I want to give you something in return. Please take a look at the gifts I will give to you in return for your gift to me on the right hand side of the page.<br/><br/>Truthfully, I could really use more money that I am asking for to make all the perks happen, pay for travel expenses, for production, for others recording with me. Together we can make that happen. Please share the campaign through Facebook, Twitter, email, word of mouth, no matter how much or how little you can give.<br/><br/>Soon a video will be uploaded with one of my songs to help you better understand my vision. This is not only about songs, but the bigger ministry the Lord has been calling me to my whole life for the Gospel.<br/></p>

For sure God has been faithful to me in all my ways even though I wasn't totally obedient to His word  and messing up all the time, but He didn't forsake, He didn't deny me. He keeps calling me His son and proving His love to me wherever I stand, knowing that God  chose me and gave to me a big mission to accomplish in the world. I have come to the point of realizing that everything I have from Him must be freely given away.In order to allow every gift to perform He has chose to give me some revelation, words, and prophecy to be able to share them with the world. However, I kept using some excuses just to run away from His calling. Then, He told me to be strong and courageous, to fear not, and to not be dismayed. Arise and work! (1 Chronicles 22:11-16) 
My album will be just the start of God's calling in my life to bring people into His presence and minister his love to the nations. The Lord has seen my heart, my courage, and my desire to stand and reach the nations. So now I am allowing Him to do more than what I expect. The album will feature 10 songs in 5 languages: English, French, Swahili, Lingala, Kiluba. I have chose to use all these languages in the way of being thankful for whatever He has gave me to be used for His glory.After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could 
number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, 
standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, 
with palm branches in their hands. (Revelation 7:9)I bring a unique personal and global perspective on worship that is global, freeing, authentic, and uniting.
For investing in this mission, I want to give you something in return. Please take a look at the gifts I will give to you in return for your gift to me on the right hand side of the page.Truthfully, I could really use more money that I am asking for to make all the perks happen, pay for travel expenses, for production, for others recording with me. Together we can make that happen. Please share the campaign through Facebook, Twitter, email, word of mouth, no matter how much or how little you can give.Soon a video will be uploaded with one of my songs to help you better understand my vision. This is not only about songs, but the bigger ministry the Lord has been calling me to my whole life for the Gospel.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>Hello! This is Ataraxia. We're a five member metal/Hard Rock band from Bangalore, India. We're all students, trying to follow our passion. There's not much scope for heavy, hardcore music in India. So, those who opt this genre of music have to make it on their own. All of us in the band are from different places, have different habits, different lifestyles. But there's one common interest that we share and that's what brought us together, MUSIC.</p>
<p>We formed ATARAXIA a year back and have been regularly practicing and performing ever since.The word ataraxia comes from ancient greek ""<b>ἀταραξία</b>"".It means emotional tranquility or peace of mind. We've participated in two 'Battle of the Bands' and won in one of them. But till now we only played cover songs on stage. When we started composing our own music, it was transcendental! We could not wait to share our music with the world. </p>

<p><b>Kahil El'Zabar</b> is considered by his peers to be one of the most prolific innovators of his generation. He has recorded more than sixty well-received projects, and has won numerous international awards as a musician and composer. Kahil is also very much about helping community.

His willingness to hold their kickoff concert in Vallejo is an example of wanting to support our dreams.<br/></p>
<p>El’Zabar has worked with such luminaries as Dizzy Gillespie, Cannonball Adderley, Stevie Wonder, Donnie Hathaway, Pharoah Sanders, Neneh Cherry, Nina Simone, Ntozake Shange, David Murray, Nona Hendryx and Lester Bowie, to name a few.</p>
<p>As a cultural events specialist, El’Zabar created and produced Underground Fest – an avant-garde jazz festival.

<p>In 2012 President Barak Obama’s administration awarded him the International Ambassador’s Award in the Arts.

<p><b>Hamiet Bluiett</b> has combined the avant-garde with traditional jazz for more than four decades!

<p>His primary instrument is the baritone saxophone, and <i>he is considered one of the finest living players of this instrument</i>.

When he moved to the US in the early 1990s, his promising career was cut short, while he worked, like many immigrants, doing everything from carpet cleaning to perfume factory work! As he adjusted to life in the US, he worked for many years as a music teacher in an inner city environment, bringing his love of music to the most underprivileged in our society. While he kept composing occasional pop songs, composition was mainly on the back burner.</p>
<p>But life intervened! Inspiration came in the form of an unlikely muse - a middle-aged balding former army buddy (and a renowned flutist) asked him to compose something for his daughter's graduation from music college. What followed, in the span of only a few days was ""Fairy Tale"" - a whimsical nouveau-classical piece for piano and orchestra hailed as ""great
music with an elegant appearance - a real feast and a real fairy tale!"" by the critics.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, as Eugene sat in his kitchen in suburban New Jersey, he saw what would become the inspiration for a piece that conquered the flute world by storm and blazed a path for all future orchestral works - a lovely little fluttering hummingbird (colibri).

</div></div>","Please help American composer Eugene Magalif share his beautiful uplifting orchestral music with the world! Eugene was a rising star pop music composer in Soviet Belarus - his music was constantly played on the radio, and he collaborated with top artists on albums and musicals. When he moved to the US in the early 1990s, his promising career was cut short, while he worked, like many immigrants, doing everything from carpet cleaning to perfume factory work! As he adjusted to life in the US, he worked for many years as a music teacher in an inner city environment, bringing his love of music to the most underprivileged in our society. While he kept composing occasional pop songs, composition was mainly on the back burner.
But life intervened! Inspiration came in the form of an unlikely muse - a middle-aged balding former army buddy (and a renowned flutist) asked him to compose something for his daughter's graduation from music college. What followed, in the span of only a few days was ""Fairy Tale"" - a whimsical nouveau-classical piece for piano and orchestra hailed as ""great
music with an elegant appearance - a real feast and a real fairy tale!"" by the critics.

Shortly afterward, as Eugene sat in his kitchen in suburban New Jersey, he saw what would become the inspiration for a piece that conquered the flute world by storm and blazed a path for all future orchestral works - a lovely little fluttering hummingbird (colibri). Since then, ""Colibri"" has been performed in over 50 countries around the world, by various instrumental combinations from symphony orchestras to duets, featuring flute, piccolo, and, most recently, even balalaika (!!!) as the solo.
At the same time as ""Colibri"" took off, Eugene was diagnosed with cancer. With the help of fantastic doctors as well as family and friends, Eugene overcame it and continued composing. A flurry of compositions followed, and now, his orchestral pieces have been performed in over 75 countries and on all continents (except Antarctica!) at various philharmonics, opera houses, concert halls and even at the White House!

What We Need & What You Get Recording a professional quality classical album is time-consuming and expensive. You have to find an amazing symphony orchestra with fantastic instruments, a great conductor, and the time and ability to record.
We have identified and coordinated with a renowned European symphony orchestra and fantastic conductor who are already starting rehearsals. However, we need to fund payment for and international team of musicians, conductor, soloists, and audio and video staff, as well as equipment. Along with the audio CD recording, we will also give a Concert for Peace featuring the composer's works, and we need funding for the venue as well as travel and accommodations for several distinguished international soloists. After the recording, the audio CD and the Blu Ray of the Concert both need to be mixed, edited, designed, and produced, all of which requires funding.

I'm here to raise the funds to break free from my music contract.




DOWNLOAD MY FREE EP HERE


Hey everybody!

I'm an italian/mexican rapper/singer/songwriter whose heart started beating where they eat spaghetti raised between Turin (north Italy) London and Los Angeles.
In 2009, while visiting a clothing store in Italy, I got introduced to a music producer owner of the shop but also funder of an upcoming italian record label. I got invited to the studio (which was located on the top floor) to show some skills. I clarified that I was a dancer and not a rapper but they kept on insisting (maybe I looked like one lol)
I dropped a freestyle (really not knowing where i was going with it) but I impressd him so much that he offered me to sign a RECORD DEAL with his label. (Awesome I though.. I never did this before and they offering me a contract for it?! Yeahh!!..)
I decided to sign the contract thinking I had nothing to loose. (I was young and naive and completely unaware of how the music business worked).
Few months after, I released my first EP with my first original work which didn't make any major impact. The production team, therefore, started not to follow me as an artist as before. My music (TRAP, HIP HOP) wasn't considered ""commercial enough"" to sell at that time (2009).
Anyhow I decided to dig deep into my capabilities, writing lyrics everyday and associating with people involved in the UNDERGROUND music scene.



WHAT DOES  UNDERGROUND MEANS???
1) A genre in music often characterised by its high levels of originality and experimentation, and does not conform to typical trends as set by the popular mainstream media.
So I started to release videos on YOUTUBE and getting good feedback

Since chemistry wasn't there anymore, I asked for a release from the contract in 2011 but the label asked me for 10.000 EUROS to let me go.

Unfortunately (as you can probably imagine) I didn't have that money. I had been told that my music wasn't sellable in Italy but  more suitable for a US market. So few months later they came up with a ""brilliant"" offer. They were going to pass my contract to a label from the US who had shown interest in me (like a pet at the pet store...or potatoes at the market ...You choose lol)
I didn't want to sign another exclusive deal and I asked to go independent

Their reply?
""YOU WILL NEVER MAKE IT AS AN INDEPENDENT ARTIST""
Not having much of a choice I ended up signing this other agreement which was, as the previous one, an EXCLUSIVE DEAL.
During the first year of the term I delivered 68 DEMO TRACKS to the label, having none of them released.
AN ALBUM was considered such ONLY IF the label retained the tracks in it were commercially satisfactory and I had signed 5 to them!!!
My music was defined as “UNDERGROUND S***” and the only thing the label did was releasing a mixtape in 2014 (thanks DATPIFF!) 
GOTTA LOVE IT MIXTAPE
I asked for a release many times but they asked me for 10.000 DOLLARS to be released.


In July 2014 I got contacted by multiplatinum italian rapper FEDEZ  who had seen my  UNDERGROUND videos on Youtube and asked me for a feature on his next album. The video went to 1 MILLION VIEWS ON YOUTUBE only after a week on air, gaining me much popularity and attention.



I asked the label for another release but unfortunately they weren't keen on letting me go (I guess I had turned from a  potatoe to a gold egg chicken )

2) The artist can't make music/write lyrics nor release/sell tracks to the public.



So ...
I've been under this clause from A YEAR and decided to go to NEW YORK to talk to my label face to face. She still wants money and % on my future works but I'm not keen to give up my rights to them. Especially after not helping me with my career.

<div><br/></div>
<div>We are an award-winning professional orchestra serving the communities of Frisco and McKinney. In 2014 the Odysseus Chamber Orchestra chose McKinney and Frisco to be its new home. The arts in these cities are booming with passionate citizens who love the arts, but neither city has a residential professional orchestra to call its own. The Odysseus Chamber Orchestra intends to foster and build the love for classical orchestral music in these cities. On April 24 and 25 the Odysseus Chamber Orchestra will team up with the Frisco Chorale to present the masterful Beethoven Symphony  No. 9. This is an historic event in Frisco and McKinney for it showcases the talent that the Frisco Arts Association and the McKinney Arts Commission has worked so hard to attract. It is our hope that this event will also foster a passion to help Frisco build its very own performing arts center.</div>
<div>Our goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of the performance which include paying the talented musicians in our orchestra, renting the performance facilities and other program expenses. These funds will also be used to promote and publicize the event, an expense we expect to offset through increased ticket sales. We feel this is an important part of our mission in order for us to continue to provide high level and award winning music to the communities of Frisco and McKinney. <br/>
</div>
</div><div> <p>Frisco has been one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation for the past several years. Beginning in 2016, it will be the new headquarters for the Dallas Cowboys in an area of development that has been called ""the $5 billion mile"" because of the scale of projects that are under construction. In 2014, McKinney was named the #1 ""best place to live"" by Money Magazine and has also been one of the fastest growing cities in Texas. The cultural arts not only provide a positive social and educational benefit to the community, they provide a critical input to the overall economic prosperity of the areas they serve. The Odysseus Chamber Orchestra is committed to providing this missing cultural link for Frisco and McKinney. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<div>For such a young orchestra, we have accomplished much artistically, winning national awards two years in a row. However, an orchestra cannot be sustained on talent and awards alone. Your support will help us secure our future in Frisco and McKinney by assisting us with contributions that will enable us to continue providing exceptional programs while we expand our audience to become self-supporting.

</div></div>","Odysseus Chamber Orchestra To Perform Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in Frisco and McKinney with the Frisco Chorale.

We are an award-winning professional orchestra serving the communities of Frisco and McKinney. In 2014 the Odysseus Chamber Orchestra chose McKinney and Frisco to be its new home. The arts in these cities are booming with passionate citizens who love the arts, but neither city has a residential professional orchestra to call its own. The Odysseus Chamber Orchestra intends to foster and build the love for classical orchestral music in these cities. On April 24 and 25 the Odysseus Chamber Orchestra will team up with the Frisco Chorale to present the masterful Beethoven Symphony  No. 9. This is an historic event in Frisco and McKinney for it showcases the talent that the Frisco Arts Association and the McKinney Arts Commission has worked so hard to attract. It is our hope that this event will also foster a passion to help Frisco build its very own performing arts center.
Our goal is to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of the performance which include paying the talented musicians in our orchestra, renting the performance facilities and other program expenses. These funds will also be used to promote and publicize the event, an expense we expect to offset through increased ticket sales. We feel this is an important part of our mission in order for us to continue to provide high level and award winning music to the communities of Frisco and McKinney. 

 Frisco has been one of the fastest-growing cities in the nation for the past several years. Beginning in 2016, it will be the new headquarters for the Dallas Cowboys in an area of development that has been called ""the $5 billion mile"" because of the scale of projects that are under construction. In 2014, McKinney was named the #1 ""best place to live"" by Money Magazine and has also been one of the fastest growing cities in Texas. The cultural arts not only provide a positive social and educational benefit to the community, they provide a critical input to the overall economic prosperity of the areas they serve. The Odysseus Chamber Orchestra is committed to providing this missing cultural link for Frisco and McKinney. 

For such a young orchestra, we have accomplished much artistically, winning national awards two years in a row. However, an orchestra cannot be sustained on talent and awards alone. Your support will help us secure our future in Frisco and McKinney by assisting us with contributions that will enable us to continue providing exceptional programs while we expand our audience to become self-supporting. Your contribution will also provide encouragement to each of our talented musicians by letting them know that the public views the orchestra as playing an important role in improving the quality of life in the community.  

 If you are able to make a financial contribution, it will be greatly appreciated. You can also help us by sharing this with friends who have an interest in the cultural arts and would love to have an award-winning professional orchestra performing in the local community.

<i>Rare Gems</i>: An Art of the Negro Spiritual Recording Project</h3>
<p><i><b>Rare Gems</b></i> is the working title for a project that has grown dear to my heart, and I am asking your support to make it happen.  <br/></p>
<p>I have been singing all of my life--in fact, my mother says I sang in her womb!  And I've been singing the Negro Spiritual for as long as I can remember.  For more than 25 years, I have concentrated my studies on this music and shared it with others through performances, lectures and writings--even as part of my online radio station, Afrocentric Voices Radio.</p>
<p>Along the way, I've found songs composed from the Negro Spiritual by famed composers like William Grant Still, Robert Nathaniel Dett, Florence Price and others--that I believe have never or rarely been commercially recorded.  I want to gather these <i><b>Rare Gems</b></i> together onto a recording that would be available to all interested in this wonderful music.<br/></p>
<p>For example, you have possibly heard me perform Margaret Bonds' beautiful song cycle, <i>Five Creek-Freedmen Spirituals</i>, in recital.  (If you haven't, there's a video of me singing a track available in the Gallery.)  Various songs have been commercially recorded separately, but not the cycle as a whole.  I want to make this happen so a wider audience can hear this lovely work as well as other songs like it.</p>
<p>Joining me on this project is collaborative pianist Marlys Grimm.  Marlys and I have only been working together for a couple of years, but she ""gets"" what I am doing when I am singing Negro Spirituals.  She has brought superb artistry and musicality  to our performances together.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Putting <i>Rare Gems</i> Together<br/>
</h3> <p>Putting this recording together will be a labor of love for me.  Unfortunately, however, it will cost a bit more than love to see it through to completion.  I'm projecting expenses to reach $5,000 to cover these cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music score purchase</li>
<li>Rehearsal time</li>
<li>Studio recording time (including paying pianist and engineer)<br/>
</li>
<li>Acquisition of recording rights for copyrighted songs<br/>
</li>
<li>Recording mastering and production<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The recording would occur at Grinnell College in January, 2016, while the school is on Winter Break, with an expected release three months later in April. or early May <br/></p>

<p><b>THE IDEA</b></p>
<p>Help us create<b><i> The</i></b> <b><i>Electric Guitar Show</i></b> an
exciting new WebTV series created by <b><i>guitarists</i></b> for <b><i>guitarists</i></b><i>.</i>  Hosted by Stuart Bull, Tom Quayle and the
fabulous Hayley Leggs<b><i> TEGS </i></b>is a fast moving format packed
with guitar chat, features, interviews, gear reviews and star profiles. Above
all <b><i>TEGS
</i></b>is going to be fun with some great guitar playing from our hosts, our
guests and our superb in house band.</p>
<p>All musicians share a special bond and<b><i> TEGS</i></b>
wants to make that bond with the estimated 50 million guitar players out there across
the world.  Witty, edgy and driven by the
adrenaline of a live audience there’s something for everyone whether you’re a
beginner or a seasoned pro.</p>
<p>We are looking for £30,000 to fund the first series
of six 45 minute shows which will be available <b>FREE</b> on <b><a href=""http://www.electricguitarshow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.electricguitarshow.com</a></b>, <b>Youtube</b> and <b>Vimeo</b> during the summer 2015. We hope to build a fan base which
will enable further series of <b><i>TEGS</i></b> to build the global TV audience
the electric guitar truly deserves.</p>
<p><b>THE SHOW</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout
the series we will celebrate the style, sound and career of some of the world's
greatest players. Each show will feature an artist and here the band really
show their talent with some fantastic tributes. In <b><i>My Guitar History</i></b> we ask
a guest how they came to chose their current axe and hear some of their embarrassing
guitar stories of the past. Stu then guides them through the tricky <b><i>Star</i></b><i> <b>with
a Reasonably Priced Guitar</b></i> challenge. You can also ask Stu about that
difficult guitar part in <b><i>Riffbusters.</i></b></p>
<p>Tom is not only a brilliant player but has that
special gift to explain the technical side of guitars and guitar gear. Tom gives
us some great tips on everything from guitar buying to equipment reviews to
finding that elusive guitar tone. You can also contact him to solve your own guitar
problem.</p>
<p>Hayley takes <b><i>TEGS</i></b> out on the road and is working
on stories like <b><i>Why Relic a Perfectly Nice Guitar?, Attack of the Cover Bands </i></b><i>and<b>
Marshall: 50 Years of Glory</b></i>. She also takes a regular peek at some of
the <b><i>Online
Guitar Heads</i></b> who inhabit the internet. We will also introduce <b><i>Professor
Rock</i></b> – journalist Malcolm Dome is our very own walking talking encyclopedia
of rock. </p>
<p>There’s also a chance for you to play a part in the
programme.  We will be using the best
comments and ideas from our social media site. There will also be competitions
with some great gear prizes and giveaways.</p>

</div>","THE IDEA
Help us create The Electric Guitar Show an
exciting new WebTV series created by guitarists for guitarists.  Hosted by Stuart Bull, Tom Quayle and the
fabulous Hayley Leggs TEGS is a fast moving format packed
with guitar chat, features, interviews, gear reviews and star profiles. Above
all TEGS
is going to be fun with some great guitar playing from our hosts, our
guests and our superb in house band.
All musicians share a special bond and TEGS
wants to make that bond with the estimated 50 million guitar players out there across
the world.  Witty, edgy and driven by the
adrenaline of a live audience there’s something for everyone whether you’re a
beginner or a seasoned pro.
We are looking for £30,000 to fund the first series
of six 45 minute shows which will be available FREE on www.electricguitarshow.com, Youtube and Vimeo during the summer 2015. We hope to build a fan base which
will enable further series of TEGS to build the global TV audience
the electric guitar truly deserves.
THE SHOW

Throughout
the series we will celebrate the style, sound and career of some of the world's
greatest players. Each show will feature an artist and here the band really
show their talent with some fantastic tributes. In My Guitar History we ask
a guest how they came to chose their current axe and hear some of their embarrassing
guitar stories of the past. Stu then guides them through the tricky Star with
a Reasonably Priced Guitar challenge. You can also ask Stu about that
difficult guitar part in Riffbusters.
Tom is not only a brilliant player but has that
special gift to explain the technical side of guitars and guitar gear. Tom gives
us some great tips on everything from guitar buying to equipment reviews to
finding that elusive guitar tone. You can also contact him to solve your own guitar
problem.
Hayley takes TEGS out on the road and is working
on stories like Why Relic a Perfectly Nice Guitar?, Attack of the Cover Bands and
Marshall: 50 Years of Glory. She also takes a regular peek at some of
the Online
Guitar Heads who inhabit the internet. We will also introduce Professor
Rock – journalist Malcolm Dome is our very own walking talking encyclopedia
of rock. 
There’s also a chance for you to play a part in the
programme.  We will be using the best
comments and ideas from our social media site. There will also be competitions
with some great gear prizes and giveaways.
Please visit www.electricguitarshow.com
for more background on our presenters, guests, band as well as what’s coming
up. You can also browse some of our exclusive merchandise.

THE HOSTS

TEGS
is hosted by mega talented player Stuart
Bull. His easy going charm has inspired thousands of guitar players through

company he founded over 15 years ago.

Tom takes us through some gear reviews and shows us how to get the best from the stuff we own.Adding her own unique twist is musician and Total Rock Radio DJ Hayley Leggs. Hayley will be on the road bringing us some great
