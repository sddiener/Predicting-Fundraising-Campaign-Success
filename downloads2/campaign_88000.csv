Many specifically require chargers to have a high enough PF (Power Factor) value. The reason is that a charger/adapter with a low PF value will cause extra load on a local power grid. Power companies sometimes charge commercial customers more for using low PF electronics on their network. A charger that fails to meet local PF requirements should not be legally sold or used in many countries. <br/><br/>This isn’t something you need to worry about with SlimQ F240.

My Razer Blade runs on a 230W adapter. The charger does not feel hot at all during the whole process, good job there. I also run some 3D software to stress the laptop a little while charging with F240, the charger behaved as expected, not hot. My Razer Blade has a 1070 video card, which is not exactly the most power consuming but it appears the F240 charger can handle more load without a problem. Compare with the original adapter which is also good looking, the F240 has two more USB C ports which are convenient. I suggested the SlimQ team to add a USB C to USB A converter so some small devices can also be charged. Overall, I am happy with this F240 charger and I am just hoping the team can source a Razer Blade connector so they can officially have a converter for my laptop.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618828033/otekoaiohh9vbd6sfrd7.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622534487/xgw6p5fsyv8kaxgvakzf.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618484636/fnzhbbawro9bc2kpktj0.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1634718479/jjjyrslfbiogbolrgw8a.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1634718495/drc01c1j3dgtrlikqvsy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618652897/lh49xebg3ghz1uorqj4e.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1634718540/ibqwlylrtmuonu4ejmpc.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1634718546/ebofeguzvlzffkg29amm.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619176973/kkvjdhdno0nxbpwkc8zg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618650276/allpf1xyn90ba7zs28pb.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622700930/opqiz1n8pms7kvokrtvx.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618650333/wmxsa7fcxhzir5uf5hrx.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618816909/rvkdtd2dlsfy1ctcltxa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>You can buy add-ons after you choose the perk.

This way SlimQ chargers can continue to work effectively, at full capacity, and for many hours. Many other chargers can’t deal with the excess heat the chargers generate. Oftentimes, those chargers will have to reduce their output capacity after a short period of usage (often less than an hour) when the heat gets too much.  This under-power condition will cause high-performance computers to underperform. The F240 does not have this problem.  What makes this a truly global charger？This is a charger you can use all over the world. You might not know that all countries have safety requirements for chargers. Many specifically require chargers to have a high enough PF (Power Factor) value. The reason is that a charger/adapter with a low PF value will cause extra load on a local power grid. Power companies sometimes charge commercial customers more for using low PF electronics on their network. A charger that fails to meet local PF requirements should not be legally sold or used in many countries. This isn’t something you need to worry about with SlimQ F240. It has a built-in PFC (Power Factory Correction) circuit and components to make sure the charger has a high enough PF value to be legal to use in any country in the world.   We are using four top-notch GaN chips from Navitas and Transphorm, who are the leaders in developing new generation GaN chips. These chips perform up to 20x faster than old, slow silicon (Si) chips, delivering up to 3x more power conversion. Their amazing tech enables SlimQ F240 to be built with such a compact design and still provide high power capacity.   Play your computer video games, create your 3D renders or work on your engineering project with total safety. Even with the most power-demanding computing tasks, the SlimQ 240W charger will NEVER HEAT UP and ALWAYS provide multi-layer total protection.  Here at SlimQ, we celebrate practicality and convenience because we know that’s what users who are often on the go want and need. Our goal is to create iconic and functional products that truly provide solutions. The new SlimQ 240W charger is designed to look good with a superior feeling and grip.   We’ve been able to establish a beta program thanks to our great community of backers. Since January 2021, we have been having many people testing the F240 on many devices in real-life situations. The feedback? Overwhelmingly positive. Plus we got valuable suggestions as well. Thanks to all our beta testers for helping us test SlimQ F240 on all these devices: iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone XS Max, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro, Galaxy S10, Galaxy Note 10+, Samsung S20, Galaxy Note 20 +, OnePlus 7T, OnePlus 8T, iPad Mini, iPad Pro, iPad Pro 11 2018, Eluktronics RP-15, MacBook Pro 13, Macbook Pro 16, Microsoft Surface, Microsoft Surface Pro 4, Razer Blade 15 and Dell Precision 15, Lenovo Laptop, Two Dell D7400 at the same time, Dell D7900, ...  I love the feel and grip of the charger. It feels very sturdy. A perfect scenario for this charger (with Usb-C port) is that I will only need to bring this charger along when I am travelling (once this Covid nightmare is over), and I will be able to use it to charge my power bank and Nintendo Switch and my partner's phone instead of carrying multiple chargers. The charger doesn't feel hot at all. I like the LED indicator to show that it is working.  I was able to solder a Razer Blade connector to be used with the F240 cable and it worked on my Razer Blade 15. My Razer Blade runs on a 230W adapter. The charger does not feel hot at all during the whole process, good job there. I also run some 3D software to stress the laptop a little while charging with F240, the charger behaved as expected, not hot. My Razer Blade has a 1070 video card, which is not exactly the most power consuming but it appears the F240 charger can handle more load without a problem. Compare with the original adapter which is also good looking, the F240 has two more USB C ports which are convenient. I suggested the SlimQ team to add a USB C to USB A converter so some small devices can also be charged. Overall, I am happy with this F240 charger and I am just hoping the team can source a Razer Blade connector so they can officially have a converter for my laptop.    You can buy add-ons after you choose the perk.

The problem was that people usually play tennis as a two or four without somebody available to be the camera person. A robotic videoing assistant was the answer, but after trying a range of existing products, nothing was satisfactory - especially for a quick moving sports setting.</p><p>The decision was made to invent something and some specialists were brought in. The project quickly developed and a series of prototypes were created.</p><p>We then loaned our prototypes to various people to seek feedback from user trials and found that the prototype devices ended up being used for a variety of different uses and mostly outside of sports videoing.</p><p>People used them for home videoing, for vlogs, TikTok along with manual functions (perfect panos, 360 degree motion time lapse videos). The feedback from user trials was that we should open up the product to all sectors of robot videoing and the photography sector too for manual control functions. Feedback was that we should create a range of apps bringing out different features of the AVA Robot. </p><p>The devices were even suggested for indie film makers and were even used by a mainstream film director, actor, writer and comedian - Tony Hawks who felt that there was real potential for this device to support amateur film makers and also for family videos and family games using its AI auto-tracking capabilities. He then became an ambassador of the project.</p><p>It was also clear that there was a demand for AVA to have an option of being  unshackled from its supporting app to allow complete freedom for robotic videoing.

It's your very own personal robot videographer. Unlike other robots and gimbals, it's been built specifically for the high demands of sports player tracking. However, it can be used for ANY hands-free auto-tracking and videoing environment.With the EyeSite Module attached (on the AVA Full Pack), you can add movement to your Zoom conference calls, Facetime, Instagram, Skype..etc, you could even use as a moving webcam?! It's got manual control functionality too for those wanting a smooth pan, motion time lapse videos (1, 3, 6, 9 hour for 360 degrees settings) or a perfect panorama - great for photography enthusiasts. The 'AVA & Accessories' reward works in the above scenarios. Users can use the AVA app for great Ai features and auto-tracking (or can use 3rd party compatible apps). Manual control option is also possible via a remote.The 'AVA - Full Pack' reward also includes the 'EyeSite' attachment module (amongst everything else we've made). This EyeSite module is a dedicated piece of ai/machine learning hardware with a camera to report the position of the subject back to AVA who'll move accordingly. It therefore means whatever is mounted onto the EyeSite module is piggy-backing on its auto-tracking. It means you free to load any app or mount any device (less than 1kg) and get auto-tracking applied.The EyeSite module (prototype pictured) currently exists a working prototype. We're going to shrink it, beautify it and get it professionally made if we hit our funding goal. It will be available as part of the 'AVA - Full Pack' reward for Kickstarter backers. An AVA Prototype user in our 'proof of concept' and user trials tests the AVA + EyeSite combo to allow her to load TikTok directly from her phone and get auto-tracking movement on her TikTok video.  AVA has 9 speed settings that are automatically selected and seamlessly inter-change in 'auto-tracking mode' to keep a person (or other subject) smoothly in the centre of the device field of view.  It can do a full rotation in less than 3 seconds which is powerful enough to follow and record the quickest and most demanding of sports tracking environments - sprinting players and even ball tracking in some cases. In Manual Mode, the speed settings can be controlled via a remote and are ideally suited to the photography industry with manual control usage scenarios - smooth panning, panoramas, time-lapse videos..etc. As well as the 9 standard speed settings, it's got 4 super-slow modes for motion time-lapse videos (1hr, 3hrs, 6hrs, 9hrs for 360 degrees).    Our story started in late 2019 when the project creator Paul Jessop was looking for a solution for a problem with his 'in-development' sports video analysis business (called ShotPage) which required players to video their tennis shots and then forward the footage to their coaches for analysis. The problem was that people usually play tennis as a two or four without somebody available to be the camera person. A robotic videoing assistant was the answer, but after trying a range of existing products, nothing was satisfactory - especially for a quick moving sports setting.The decision was made to invent something and some specialists were brought in. The project quickly developed and a series of prototypes were created.We then loaned our prototypes to various people to seek feedback from user trials and found that the prototype devices ended up being used for a variety of different uses and mostly outside of sports videoing.People used them for home videoing, for vlogs, TikTok along with manual functions (perfect panos, 360 degree motion time lapse videos). The feedback from user trials was that we should open up the product to all sectors of robot videoing and the photography sector too for manual control functions. Feedback was that we should create a range of apps bringing out different features of the AVA Robot. The devices were even suggested for indie film makers and were even used by a mainstream film director, actor, writer and comedian - Tony Hawks who felt that there was real potential for this device to support amateur film makers and also for family videos and family games using its AI auto-tracking capabilities. He then became an ambassador of the project.It was also clear that there was a demand for AVA to have an option of being  unshackled from its supporting app to allow complete freedom for robotic videoing. This resulted in the creation of the EyeSite module (currently in its first prototype) In July 2020 Paul tweeted the original AVA videos (shown above) which were noticed by Google's Senior Developer Advocate - Jason Mayes, who later interviewed Paul for Google's Tensorflow Channel 'Show & Tell' show that showcases demos of projects that push the boundaries of machine learning in Tensorflow.js. If you're techie and would like to know the inner workings of AVA, then check out the Tensorflow YouTube interview. As a result of a successful Kickstarter campaign, we're currently manufacturing our products and taking pre-orders via IndieGogo.We're creating 1000 AVA robots initially and completing our linked app for the functionality it needs. We're also refining our prototype EyeSite module and building 500 of these attachment modules that can attach to AVA and provide complete freedom for the auto-tracking environment. The EyeSite module will be the first of a series of attachment modules that we'll produce for AVA. Plans for others include a 3D Module, Smart Tennis Court Module, Games Module and an Animation Module. They'll all look similar to the EyeSite Module but will have their own separate functions to bring a different artificial intelligence feature to the AVA Robot. If we're successful in hitting our goal, our timeline is as follows:March - Full audit of current production prototype and application of European and International sales certification (CE & FCC..etc). Develop production prototype of EyeSite Module.April - Nov Place order for AVA devices with manufacturers & continue building enhanced functionality into the AVA App. - April Place accessories order with manufacturers - April Assessment of new production prototype of EyeSite module. - April Continuation of App features - April, May, June Place manufacturing order for EyeSite Module - November Nov/DecShip 'AVA + accessories' rewards. - November  Ship 'AVA - Full Pack' rewards - DecemberContinue App development for new features and feature refinementsOngoingContinue to push App and AVA firmware updates for new features and improved functionality. AVA works across Android and iOS but will require a mid to high-end device to operate given the state of the art app functions, recording process and tracking algorithm all required in real-time.Minimum level devices required to support the AI tracking functions of the AVA Robot will be the equivalent of:Samsung Galaxy S9 or betterApple iPhone 8 or betterThere are no performance requirements for Manual mode (using a remote)iPads and Tablets are also compatible with AVA as long as they are less than 1kg in weight, are mounted to a tripod and have specs comparable or better than the above devices.When the EyeSite module is attached to AVA, there are no performance requirement of the mounted device other than perhaps some calibration of the mounted device's field of view with what the EyeSite module is seeing (done via the AVA app where settings are then copied to the EyeSite module).  We're a sports video analysis company in development (ShotPage Ltd) and our flagship product will be this AVA device tailored for a sports and coaching environment - particularly tennis.

For our first design, we decide to take the ubiquitous flat round Qi wireless charging pad, add some thickness to it to accommodate USB-C hub elements. However a perfect circle is not a very efficient shape for laying out electronic components. We also explored a perfect square design but it was too utilitarian. We finally decided on an organic design with rounded edges. When we wanted to add a convertible phone stand tray to our rounded square prototype, we realized that tray was too short to stably support a phone in portrait position. Hence we came up with the final design which is a cross between a rounded rectangle and an oval which provided a stand tall enough to stably support a phone in portrait mode. The additional space also allowed us to have not 1 but 3 wireless charging coils, an LCD display panel and compartment to for the built-in cable to stowaway.</p><h2>Proof of Concept</h2><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dcIAGoA8nO4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>The above unedited video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperDrive with all ports working (2 x USB 3.1 hard drives, USB-C Power Delivery, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI display, microSD, SD and USB flash drive).

As a very positive result of removing this built-in cable, we are able to make significant improvements to the design.First and foremost, the HyperDrive will be much thinner and sleeker looking now, with the same length, width and design lines as the iPhone X. The charging USB-C port is also now moved to the back of the HyperDrive for better cable management when the HyperDrive is used as a standalone wireless charger.5 Reasons why HyperDrive is better than other wireless chargers 1) 7.5W Wireless ChargingAlmost all Qi wireless chargers currently in the market are the 5W, 10W or 15W variety designed for Android Smartphones which may not work well with the iPhone or charge the iPhone very slowly at less than 5W.HyperDrive is the only wireless charger that supports all 4 Qi wireless charging standards (7.5W, 5W, 10W and 15W)HyperDrive supports the latest Qi wireless charging standard including 7.5W high speed wireless charging optimized for the iPhone as well as 5/10/15W high speed wireless charging of Android smartphones.Better and faster than mophie and Belkin wireless chargers sold by Apple
HyperDrive is the only wireless charger that supports 5/7.5/10/15W Qi standard
HyperDrive takes 2h58m to full charge iPhone X from empty, faster than mophie & Belkin
HyperDrive is the World's 1st wireless charging stand with LCD voltage/current display
HyperDrive supports both USB QC and USB-C PD input which supports firmware update while mophie/Belkin uses DC input which does not support firmware update
HyperDrive has a built-in USB-C hub with 3 x USB power output (5V1.5A)
HyperDrive has not 1 but 3 charging coils to allow iPhone to charge in any position
2) Lower TemperatureTraditional Qi wireless chargers generate too much heat which may cause the iPhone to shut downTraditional Qi wireless chargers are not very efficient and generate a lot of heat which causes the iPhone to reduce or stop charging completely to lower operating temperature.iPhone 8/X will charge wirelessly at 

7.5W at temperatures below 36.5ºC/97.7ºF


5W at temperatures between 36.5ºC/97.7ºF and 38ºC/100.4ºF


3W at temperatures between 38ºC/100.4ºF and 40ºC/104ºF


0W (stop charging) at temperatures above 40ºC/104ºF

HyperDrive is a low temperature device and insulates the iPhone from any little heat it generates so that it can charge properlyHyperDrive uses power efficient components and is designed to be a low temperature (25ºC/77ºF) device. Whatever little heat generated is dissipated from the aluminum sides and is isolated from the iPhone by an air gap and insulator convertible stand layer.3) Fixed frequency that does not interfere with Touch and Face IDTraditional Qi wireless chargers may emit frequencies that interfere with Touch or Face IDTraditional Qi wireless chargers are made with low cost materials that have fluctuating electromagnetic frequencies that may interfere with iPhone functions like Touch & FaceID.HyperDrive uses a fixed frequency designated by Apple that does not interfere with Touch or Face IDHyperDrive uses a fixed wireless charging frequency designated by Apple and is guaranteed to work perfectly with the iPhone.4) Firmware upgradeableAs HyperDrive uses USB-C input instead of DC input (Belkin/mophie). It is currently the only iPhone wireless charger in the market that is firmware upgradeable to support new features like faster iPhone wireless charging speeds in the future.5) Award winning USB-C hubBesides being a great wireless charger, HyperDrive also incorporates award winning USB-C hub capabilities that raised over $3.1 million on Kickstarter and Indiegogo and has hundreds of positive reviews with an average 4 star rating on Amazon and BestBuy.Despite its features and having a USB-C hub, HyperDrive is no bigger than the ordinary wireless charger sold in the Apple StoreAnd is actually thinner than the most popular Android wireless charger on the marketA single HyperDrive replaces $250 worth of separate accessoriesBut you can get HyperDrive USB-C Hub + 7.5W Wireless Charger for as low as $119Rewards Indiegogo Special ($40 off)

Design StoryThe initial idea of this product was to combine a Qi wireless charger with a USB-C hub and make it as compact as possible. For our first design, we decide to take the ubiquitous flat round Qi wireless charging pad, add some thickness to it to accommodate USB-C hub elements. However a perfect circle is not a very efficient shape for laying out electronic components. We also explored a perfect square design but it was too utilitarian. We finally decided on an organic design with rounded edges. When we wanted to add a convertible phone stand tray to our rounded square prototype, we realized that tray was too short to stably support a phone in portrait position. Hence we came up with the final design which is a cross between a rounded rectangle and an oval which provided a stand tall enough to stably support a phone in portrait mode. The additional space also allowed us to have not 1 but 3 wireless charging coils, an LCD display panel and compartment to for the built-in cable to stowaway.Proof of ConceptThe above unedited video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperDrive with all ports working (2 x USB 3.1 hard drives, USB-C Power Delivery, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI display, microSD, SD and USB flash drive). HyperDrive is also shown to provide pass through power delivery to the 15"" MacBook Pro as well as wirelessly charge the iPhone X at 7.5W (5V, 1.5A) in multiple positions. HyperDrive is plug-n-play and interfaces directly with Mac OS or Windows. Plugging devices into HyperDrive is like plugging directly to the computer. On Mac OS, video displays are controlled by Mac OS System Preferences > Displays. Power delivery by Mac OS System Preferences > Energy Saver. External storage are controlled by Mac OS Finder.About usHYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making award winning Apple accessories since 2009.

But it only works on the latest iPhone 12, and even they must go caseless or with MagSafe compatible casings. We want to bring MagSafe magnetic convenience to everyone, even older iPhones and Androids. And so 7 months and a few prototypes later, we took Orbit from an idea to what you're seeing now.  Prototype Testing  We've put Orbit through countless hours of laboratory testing, in order to deliver the best and safest MagSafe charger. Orbit has been tested to stay at low temperatures while charging to provide an efficient and comfortable charging experience. Product Demo Orbit Wireless Charger (prototype)  Orbit Pad (prototype)  Orbit Stand (prototype)  Orbit Pad's Magnetic Strength Test  Using MagSafe Accessories on Orbit Pad   Team Charby We're a product design team in Malaysia with a curiosity and passion for engineering.

Having two input ports also allow us to provide more speed and bandwidth (50Gb/s) to HyperDrive, allowing it to provide as many ports (7 in total, all of which can be used simultaneously) in the tiniest of spaces. 2015 MacBook Pro & 2016 MacBook Pro with HyperDriveWe decided to go with popular output ports (HDMI, SD, microSD, 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 1) found in the previous MacBook Pro model. Although HyperDrive takes up two USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro, it also returns a USB-C and a 40Gb/s USB-C port as well, which supports up to 100W power delivery pass through charging through HyperDrive.Ultra Low Power Consumption Design (so we won't drain your MacBook Pro battery like other dongles do)Every component in HyperDrive (hub, card reader, DC/DC converter, power delivery, USB-C chipset) utilizes industry leading low power consumption technologies. The end result is a power efficiency of up to 96% and device operating temperature of less than 48ºC / 118ºF. Despite its many features, HyperDrive will consume much less power than other dongles, leaving more power for your MacBook Pro.Specifications

Inferior sound quality to headphones; choppy Bluetooth connection and annoying audio stutter; take forever to find the case to put them back in or take them out; notoriously easy to lose because of their small size…We think there ought to be a better solution. Aside from its supreme sound quality and rock-solid wireless connection that rival the headphones doubling its price, what really distinguishes it from other TWS earbuds is its paradigm-shifting magnetic snap-on design which keeps it attached to iPhone 12, or any phone’s back when used with the included ultra slim metallic frame. It is super easy to carry, store and access, either on your phone or used alone, offering you a joy of music that can never be missing and always ready at hand.Thanks to the latest Qualcomm 3040 flagship chipset embedded, you can finally bath in that fastest, sutter-free wireless audio you have always wanted. The next generation Bluetooth technology successfully eliminates the audio pauses abound in almost all other TWS earbuds which could result in frustrating or even unbearable choppy music. The most stable connection, hence the unsurpassed listening experience ascends your spirit sky high.The Snapods earbuds slot into shafts at the back of the phone. So whenever you need to use your phone to listen to music, podcast, watch videos, play games, make calls, or after you are done using it, you will always have your earbuds ready to be deployed or stowed away at fingertips. You will never lose or misplace your earbuds ever again, and they will always be there the next time you need them.The magnetic force holds Snapods earbuds and case firmly on your phone and won’t come loose or off during the fiercest movement, but will move smoothly when you slide them in or out. The sleek and compact design makes it extremely comfortable to grip and easy to hold.With other TWS earbuds, you will always be interfered by a pause or a voice prompt when you switch from one earbud to the other. Scendo Snapods features an upgraded TWS technology over the previous generation, the TrueWireless Mirroring Technology, which realizes true seamless and rapid swap between the two earbuds while cutting down the power consumption by 50%. Now, with Scendo Snapods, you will notice absolutely no interruption at all, and switching between earbuds will feel more natural and instinctive than ever.Scendo Snapods comes with Bluetooth 5.2, the fastest, most advanced Bluetooth technology around to reach the lowest latency and highest level of robustness. You can confidently use your Snapods earbuds when facetiming, playing games, or viewing online videos with no lip-sync issues.Snapods engineers have years-long association with the world’s leading audio brands in skillfully tuning the sound to include rich details and wide soundstage for a phenomenal listening experience. With a bespoke 13mm over-size dynamic driver coated in graphene, a high-performance, flexible diaphragm material for audio, the bass and treble response are both extended with high sensitivity and ultra-low distortion, so every music genre, from classical to contemporary, is enhanced on accuracy and clarity to ignite your emotions.Snapods provides wired quality sound wirelessly through its support of the top two commonly used compression algorithms - AAC and aptX. Apple devices rely on the AAC for Bluetooth streaming, while most Android phones support aptX. They are practically synonymous with high-fidelity Bluetooth audio and present wireless audio as you would experience it in the live environment.Snapods earbuds are also the best buds of the new Apple iPhone 12. It is inherently attracted to the magnets embedded in the back of the device and attaches to it without the aid of anything adhesive or metallic.And not just iPhone 12, it also goes well with all other phone models when used with the included ultra slim,lightweight metallic frame. It is of negligible weight and thickness that it is imperceptible after being applied to the back of your phone, and invisible when covered beneath a phone case. The adhesive is specially treated to leave no sticky residue after peeling off.In addition to your phone, Snapods also attaches to your fridge, locker, white board, or anything metallic.With the help of the sticky metal frame, you can turn any surface into a handy accommodation for Snapods: the back of a tablet, laptop, Kindle, etc.There is up to 5 hours battery for each earbud, and up to 40 hours with the charging case. So a total of 45 hours of playtime keeps you swaying to limitless beats wherever you go, almost double the hours of Airpods.The mounting mechanism of Snapods remains your phone’s wireless charging and contactless payment intact and won’t affect the performance of your phone in any way.The case features Qi wireless charging without adding too much bulk. Snapods is the slimmest model to feature this technology. You can either place it on a wireless charging pad or plug in a Type-C cable for a quick recharge to the case. 3 LEDs on the case will flash to indicate the remaining power.The magnetic attraction is of perfect strength so Snapods effortlessly snaps on and off your phone even with a phone case on.Each Snapods earbud features 2 microphones. The Qualcomm® cVc™ noise reduction algorithm used in Snapods has evolved into cVc 8.0, the most advanced version in the current market, which is capable of filtering out up to 30 decibels of ambient noise. This cutting-edge technology kicks in after the added microphones sample the ambient noises from your voices captured by the original mics, to ensure a crystal clear call quality in boisterous conditions like a chaotic bar, busy street or loud subway.Compact and comfortable, you will find no better fit for everyday activity and sport in other earbuds. Snapods have been tested for secure fit with extra grip ergonomic design. Built with solid but lightweight engineered material which is even lighter than Apple Airpods 2, you will feel nothing but the beats when wearing these during the toughest workouts.Another advantage of the TrueWireless Mirroring Technology is that it makes pairing a breeze for you. With just one click, you can hook both earbuds to your device at once, which is superior to some of the previous TWS earbuds which requires a two-step connection to both left and right earbuds respectively - a real pain every time you try to pair your earbuds with a new device.Most TWS earbuds on the current market only offer partial control that could be either too sensitive or too tardy to maneuver. Snapods gives you a complete and intuitive set of control over your phone never experienced before, so you can stay off your smartphone for most actions. 

 

 


Snapods is a brilliant design that is the first of its kind which blazes the trail in the way of taking high-quality music with you wherever you go.Advances in technology have made TWS earphones smaller and lighter than ever, but here’s the awful truth: nearly every one of the buyers have been plagued by the hidden dark side of those earbuds —— they are easy to lose, hard to find, inconvenient to carry in the bulky case and frequent to run out of charge.As a group of audiophiles fascinated by innovations in electronics, we decided to create a revolutionary solution to these pitfalls, to bring true freedom out of true wireless earbuds to music lovers, and to set the bar for all future TWS earbuds.Snapods is designed to be the world’s first on-the-phone carrying TWS HiFi earphones. It is magnetically attached to the back of any smartphone, so it is hard to lose, quick to access, easy to carry and always powered up to accompany you on your next adventure. The Snapods Alpha was first launched on Kickstarter in August, as the world’s first anti-lost TWS earbuds with a breakthrough snap-on design. After several months' effort to upgrade, we returned to the essence of the TWS earbuds: the sound quality. We engineered it with the latest Qualcomm QCC3040 SoC, which has a higher Bluetooth version for a faster, more power-saving and stable wireless transmission; a more advanced TrueWireless Mirroring pairing mechanism for a more seamless and swift swap between earbuds; four microphones with the most up-to-date Qualcomm’s clear voice capture algorithm for crystal clear calls. Moreover, we made immediate modifications to the embedded magnets in the Snapods case to match with the MagSafe in the new iPhone 12, as soon as it came out on the market. This is a major improvement, as it is going to be the world’s first TWS earbuds with MagSafe for iPhone 12, which eliminates the need to use the adhesive metallic frame. In conclusion, the Snapods Beta will appeal to a much wider audience since it is enhanced in both appearance and audio performance.",61.0,6,"1 Campaign

<blockquote><i>A universal accessory for your smartphone</i></blockquote>
</div><div>We have been tirelessly working on improving safety and comfort of drivers while behind the wheel for over three years. We started with a phone app for iOS and Android, which has transformed our vision on how cell phones can be used in a car. By now, over one million drivers have tried our app, and we’ve been frequently getting emails of appreciation from our customers. We even have an amazing story about how our app saved a life of one person.</div><div> </div><div>

<blockquote style=""font-style: italic;""><i>HUDWAY app was initially designed for use in low visibility conditions</i></blockquote>
<p>We introduced the early prototype of HUDWAY Glass at CeBIT 2015 in Hannover for the first time. It is a simple accessory, which turns any smartphone into a head-up display. Moreover, it eliminates many issues associated with projecting an image onto a windshield, including doubling of the image, lack of reflection during daytime, image size and a few others. We received very positive response from potential customers, dealers and retailers, as well as from many major representatives of the automotive industry.</p>

<p>There are 600 million people in the world who get behind the wheel of a car every single day. According to the researches, approximately 75% of them get distracted while driving — it could be just drinking coffee, talking to a child in the back seat, reaching for the glove compartment, changing a radio station, and so on...  But the worst and most frequent distraction is our phone. </p>
<p>We are always on the phone. We talk, read, type, tweet, check and search... We do selfies and share pictures. We even do video conference calls while driving! This is especially dangerous when driving in low visibility conditions such as rain, fog, snow or just darkness... we are nearly driving blind and trying to multitask with checking directions on our smart phones. That is when bad things happen. Indeed, based on official reports, 22% of all auto accidents happen because of a driver multitasking and/or low visibility conditions — that is 750 deaths a day worldwide.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447186483/oeiqfenixc6sv1g9lbua.png"" src=""""/></p>Automakers are certainly aware of this problem and they are looking for solutions. One of them — head-up displays (HUDs) — can significantly improve the situation. With HUDs, drivers see information they need right on the windshield, which allows them to be totally focused on the road at all times. They no longer need to look away from the road to read dashboard information or check directions on the phone. It allows drivers to focus on the road, keep their hands on the wheel and mind on driving.</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447186484/fjvrjsxw4fh2yl6svn5o.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Today, the market offers two main HUD options for cars:</p>
<ul>
<li>To buy a new luxury car. There are more and more cars manufactured with built-in HUD displays. It is estimated that by 2020, 9% of all new cars will be equipped with HUD displays (currently it is just 4%). These HUDs have an excellent image quality and on-board computer integration. But they will cost you over $1,000 as an option. </li>
<li>To buy a portable HUD device. This is an aftermarket solution that can be purchased separately and simply placed before a driver’s eyes on the dashboard. This kind of device is often equipped with a display (or pico projector), sensors, special optics, and wires to connect to the car or just for charging. Although much cheaper than factory HUDs, these devices still cost about $400. </li>
</ul>
<p>We’re offering an alternative to these options. We’ve invented a car accessory for a smartphone that turns it into a head-up display. It contains no electronic components, and the phone is used as an image source — thus, <b>we can make a HUD affordable for anyone</b>. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447186485/ol7zuu7plypbqiw0g0yu.png"" src=""""/></p>The crux is in the glass. It’s the main HUDWAY Glass component — a plastic lens, very lightweight and of low fragility, which means that cuts are unlikely even if it gets broken. The glass has an aspheric shape, which allows to get a 20% larger image while at the same time minimize spherical, comatic, and chromatic aberrations. In other words, when looking through the curved glass you still see the road as it is, with no distractions. </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<p><span style=""font-style: italic;background-color: initial;"">Adjustable and compact mount</span></p>

<p>Knowing that all vehicles are different, we realized we couldn’t offer a single universal mount to suit any car. Apart from variations in dashboard shapes and sizes, vehicles differ in drivers’ seating position. Even your height matters as it dictates the angle in which you look at the road. </p>
<p>We made two simple dashboard mounts — one compact, the other — adjustable, allowing for a pretty wide range of the angle. Both equipped with a very easy snap on mechanism to attach the cradle to mounts.</p>
<p>We came to these design solutions after several tries of creating prototypes. Indeed, this is the best and most reliable way to thoroughly study any issue. We used home 3D printers for some of the intermediate prototypes. However, all major modifications were tested on the prototypes produced by  industrial printers. It allowed for excellent printing quality and accuracy — the prototypes margin of error against CAD blueprints was within 0.1%.</p>

<p>Navigation systems available today are still proving to be unsafe, diverting driver attention and focus away from the most important task in driving – eyes on the road. Current navigation systems require that drivers read and interpret data and/or listen to audio commands which has been shown to take an average time of 5 seconds for a typical adult driver. Not surprising, it is 3 seconds more than what is considered a “safe-time” by various safety studies. </p>
<p>Keeping in line with proven safety studies by NASA and other government-sponsored research on driver safety technology, head-up display (HUD) based navigation technology has quickly become safer and more effective road guidance method. HUD navigation keeps drivers' visual attention on the road while being guided. It also eliminates auditory distraction, which can force a driver to shift attention from paying attention to visual cues to simply listening to directions and back, a proven distraction factor. In short, HUD-based systems can be much more intuitive in delivering navigational information than the traditional displays while keeping the driver safe. </p>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h4>
</div><div>
<h4>What phones does it fit? iPhone 6 Plus? What if I have a case on my phone?</h4>
<h4>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Technically, it will work with any smartphone if at least 90% of its screen size caught by the glass. But the thing is that the screen reflection size directly correlates with the glass adjustment angle and can vary pretty much. This is why we'd take iPhone 6 Plus for the benchmark, and wouldn't recommend anything larger, since we have little confidence in the performance.</span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Look, although the phone is a bit longer than the accessory cradle, the screen still fits well. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here’s a pic to illustrate it: </span>
</h4>
<p><a href=""https://hsto.org/files/6bf/a2b/60a/6bfa2b60a0fe4b05a64f45bc90f38c7e.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">https://hsto.org/files/6bf/a2b/60a/6bfa2b60a0fe4b05a64f45bc90f38c7e.jpg</a></p>
<h4>
<span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, make sure your phone length and width are within 158x77 mm (6.2x3.1 inches) and feel free to make a pledge. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now about phone+case combo. We can't check all the phone model + case model combos. But what we recommend is that the overall weight of your combo is within 300-350 g (10-12 oz) — and most combinations meet this requirement. Beyond that the adjustable mount may get unstable. The compact one will still be OK to some extent. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Thus, the advice: know the weight of your phone+case combo.</span>
</h4>
<h4>How does it attach to the dashboard?</h4>
<p>Both adjustable and compact mounts stick to the surface — and by surface we mean any dashboard surface — thanks to the industrial strength adhesive. It firmly holds the accessory, and is completely removable, too. </p>
<h4>Are the adhesives reusable?</h4>
<p>1. Initially, we planned to make only the adjustable stand adhesive reusable, and the compact one non-reusable. This is because of the different size of the sticky area that attaches to the dashboard — the adjustable mount has a bigger bottom platform. Also, the compact mount in no way interferes with the visibility area, and doesn't require frequent detachments. If we manage to find a reusable adhesive that will work well on a smaller surface area, we'll definitely use it, and thus make both stands reattachable. <br/>2. Mounts ""reusability"" degree will largely depend on how well you wipe the dashboard surface before attaching the mount, and how you store the mounts when you're not using them. As we know that it's almost impossible to make users diligently follow the recommendations we may give on that, we could say that adhesion characteristics of any modern materials would fade quite soon. </p>
<h4>How does it work in daylight?</h4>
<p>Looks like the audience doesn't like short answers :) OK guys, here is an abstract of a person who tested HUDWAY Glass prototype (#nofilter #nophotoshop #nocorrections):</p>
<p>«Daytime driving. Performance depends upon time of day and brightness of the sunshine. Let me explain. In general, you can see the image clearly in HUDWAY Glass. Not unexpectedly, the level of detail that you can see at night is not present during daylight hours. Large image objects (arrows, lane markings and such) have good resolution but smaller image objects (text and numbers) may be a bit harder to discern. For example, in Awesome HUD there is a compass that is displayed on top that fades out a bit. This issue can be corrected somewhat by adjusting the angle of the glass but it is still present to some extent. <br/>Whenever you drive directly into the sun, the performance degrades significantly to the extent that the smaller image objects disappear. <br/>However, the large image objects remain visible. This is to be expected but cannot really be helped unless you can adjust the brightness of the display on your device so that it reflects better onto HUDWAY Glass».</p>
<p>And, this clearly explains why HUDWAY app deliberately avoids small elements (like texts or icons), and shows only the most important info — shows it large. Also, the visual info is supported (or duplicated) with voice assistant.</p>
<h4>What about overheating in direct sunlight?</h4>
<p>Long journeys in intense summer sunlight blazing in your face may cause phone overheating, yes — please bear in mind that HUDWAY Glass is a passive accessory, and it is not equipped with any temperature sensors and cooling elements. Smartphones have their own methods to detect overheating, switch off and cool down, you may know that. </p>
<p>Also, air conditioner and cooler temperature inside the car will considerably help the situation. </p>
<p>Additional note for those who plan to use their old smartphones for that purpose: make sure you don't leave your phone on the dashboard when parking it in hot days under harsh sunlight.</p>
<h4>Will it work for motorcycles?</h4>
<p>Short answer: no. <br/>We'd love to introduce something for motorcycles, but so far can't figure out any universal solution. For that, tech requirements will be rather different — and we need to properly study it to offer a good and safe product.</p>
<h4>Why don't you guys equip your accessory with a wireless charger?</h4>
<p>We'd love to. The least complicated solution is to add an inductive charger, but the thing is that only a very limited range of smartphone models can benefit from it. For everybody else, it bears zero value. <br/>Now, if we start thinking of some really convenient and universal solution — say, a kind of battery, so that HUDWAY Glass cradle could work as a powerbank, — this requires major revisions of the prototype we came to through several series of tests and modifications. And it goes well beyond the product we offer — moreover, it becomes a new product we cannot offer you within this campaign, as it in no sense fits the estimations on production and shipment time.</p>
<h4>What apps can I use with HUDWAY Glass? Can I use Waze or Google Maps?</h4>
<p>Look guys, it's very simple. The glass in the Glass works like a mirror — and to see the right picture in the mirror, we need the screen image to be reversed. This is what we mean when we say that the app should support HUD mode to be compatible with HUDWAY Glass. <br/>Neither Google Maps, nor Waze support this. And it's not us who can do anything about that. <br/>For those with jailbroken iPhones, there is a tweak:  <a href=""http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/03/how-to-turn-your-iphone-into-an-hud-for-your-car-heads-up-display-mode.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/03/how-to-turn-your-iphone-into-an-hud-for-your-car-heads-up-display-mode.html</a><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>For everybody else — sorry guys, no universal cure.</p>
<p>With this said, just a gentle reminder that HUDWAY app works off Google Maps, Apple Maps and OpenStreetMap — these two have pretty good coverage globally. You can switch among these in the app settings, and see which work best for your region. And we don't charge for navigation functions.</p>

Video Review by RecarroJames


 

Review by Forbes: HUDWAY Glass: A Safer (And Really Cool) GPS
Review by NikkTech: HUDWAY Glass Head-Up Display Review
 
Hi, we’re HUDWAY. We made a universal vehicle accessory that turns your smartphone into a Head-Up Display (HUD) bringing comfort and safety to drivers all over the world. We did it because we’re tired of waiting for others. Because we believe that automotive HUDs are safer than an instrument-panel display or a smartphone. And because other solutions are either very expensive, or stuck in the midst of a long and complicated development process. This is the accessory we want, and we think you’ll like it. It's simple and affordable. Discover a new way of using your phone while driving and not being distracted. 


As featured in:



A universal accessory for your smartphone
We have been tirelessly working on improving safety and comfort of drivers while behind the wheel for over three years. We started with a phone app for iOS and Android, which has transformed our vision on how cell phones can be used in a car. By now, over one million drivers have tried our app, and we’ve been frequently getting emails of appreciation from our customers. We even have an amazing story about how our app saved a life of one person. 

HUDWAY app was initially designed for use in low visibility conditions
We introduced the early prototype of HUDWAY Glass at CeBIT 2015 in Hannover for the first time. It is a simple accessory, which turns any smartphone into a head-up display. Moreover, it eliminates many issues associated with projecting an image onto a windshield, including doubling of the image, lack of reflection during daytime, image size and a few others. We received very positive response from potential customers, dealers and retailers, as well as from many major representatives of the automotive industry.

Since then, we have improved our design, run a number of tests and completed production of our first sample batch of 100 devices. 



It is super easy to use HUDWAY Glass


Step 1: Use any smartphone to start any app that supports HUD mode

Step 2: Place your smartphone on a cradle with its display up 

Step 3: You are all set to go! 



 
We recommend you start by using the following apps:

HUDWAY app is our own app specifically designed to assist drivers when navigating in low visibility conditions on rural or remote roadways. Here is a demo video of the app https://vimeo.com/97818544 and a short promo https://vimeo.com/75947078
Available for iOS and Android  FREE PROMO CODE IN THE BOX 
HUD Widgets app - set of handy and popular navigation widgets, like speedometers, trip info, landmeter, weather, eco-driving, etc. All widgets work in regular or head-up display (HUD) mode. Available for iOS and Android 
 
Navmii app is also offering good offline maps (worldwide) for navigation and neat info visualization in HUD mode.  Available for iOS and Android   
Sygic is a navigation app offering global offline maps and supporting HUD mode.
 
Baidu maps is the most popular navigation app for China, which supports HUD mode, too.  
You can always find more apps by searching “HUD” in app stores: Apple App Store | Google Play Market
App stores have been showing a stable growth of the navigation and infotainment apps offering HUD (Head-Up Display) mode. Below is just a few of them, designed to reduce attention split and get all the navigation information right on the windshield. 


See it in Action

 
Will my phone fly off the cradle, if I brake abruptly?Here’s a special video for that. Shake it!
Can I perhaps watch video using HUDWAY Glass?
Well, technically you can. Just make sure you’re properly parked before you start.


Does it work with any app?
Yes, any app with HUD mode. Here is an example — Navmii app.


There are 600 million people in the world who get behind the wheel of a car every single day. According to the researches, approximately 75% of them get distracted while driving — it could be just drinking coffee, talking to a child in the back seat, reaching for the glove compartment, changing a radio station, and so on...  But the worst and most frequent distraction is our phone. 
We are always on the phone. We talk, read, type, tweet, check and search... We do selfies and share pictures. We even do video conference calls while driving! This is especially dangerous when driving in low visibility conditions such as rain, fog, snow or just darkness... we are nearly driving blind and trying to multitask with checking directions on our smart phones. That is when bad things happen. Indeed, based on official reports, 22% of all auto accidents happen because of a driver multitasking and/or low visibility conditions — that is 750 deaths a day worldwide.  
Automakers are certainly aware of this problem and they are looking for solutions. One of them — head-up displays (HUDs) — can significantly improve the situation. With HUDs, drivers see information they need right on the windshield, which allows them to be totally focused on the road at all times. They no longer need to look away from the road to read dashboard information or check directions on the phone. It allows drivers to focus on the road, keep their hands on the wheel and mind on driving.

Today, the market offers two main HUD options for cars:

To buy a new luxury car. There are more and more cars manufactured with built-in HUD displays. It is estimated that by 2020, 9% of all new cars will be equipped with HUD displays (currently it is just 4%). These HUDs have an excellent image quality and on-board computer integration. But they will cost you over $1,000 as an option. 
To buy a portable HUD device. This is an aftermarket solution that can be purchased separately and simply placed before a driver’s eyes on the dashboard. This kind of device is often equipped with a display (or pico projector), sensors, special optics, and wires to connect to the car or just for charging. Although much cheaper than factory HUDs, these devices still cost about $400. 

We’re offering an alternative to these options. We’ve invented a car accessory for a smartphone that turns it into a head-up display. It contains no electronic components, and the phone is used as an image source — thus, we can make a HUD affordable for anyone. 
The crux is in the glass. It’s the main HUDWAY Glass component — a plastic lens, very lightweight and of low fragility, which means that cuts are unlikely even if it gets broken. The glass has an aspheric shape, which allows to get a 20% larger image while at the same time minimize spherical, comatic, and chromatic aberrations. In other words, when looking through the curved glass you still see the road as it is, with no distractions. 

 
Adjustable and compact mount

But there’s more! A thin multilayered glass coating is a “secret sauce” of HUDWAY Glass — and its important feature. Its main purpose is to enhance the reflective properties of the glass and preserve its transparency, so that your view of the road is never obstructed. 
Knowing that all vehicles are different, we realized we couldn’t offer a single universal mount to suit any car. Apart from variations in dashboard shapes and sizes, vehicles differ in drivers’ seating position. Even your height matters as it dictates the angle in which you look at the road. 
We made two simple dashboard mounts — one compact, the other — adjustable, allowing for a pretty wide range of the angle. Both equipped with a very easy snap on mechanism to attach the cradle to mounts.
We came to these design solutions after several tries of creating prototypes. Indeed, this is the best and most reliable way to thoroughly study any issue. We used home 3D printers for some of the intermediate prototypes. However, all major modifications were tested on the prototypes produced by  industrial printers. It allowed for excellent printing quality and accuracy — the prototypes margin of error against CAD blueprints was within 0.1%.

Navigation systems available today are still proving to be unsafe, diverting driver attention and focus away from the most important task in driving – eyes on the road. Current navigation systems require that drivers read and interpret data and/or listen to audio commands which has been shown to take an average time of 5 seconds for a typical adult driver. Not surprising, it is 3 seconds more than what is considered a “safe-time” by various safety studies. 
Keeping in line with proven safety studies by NASA and other government-sponsored research on driver safety technology, head-up display (HUD) based navigation technology has quickly become safer and more effective road guidance method. HUD navigation keeps drivers' visual attention on the road while being guided. It also eliminates auditory distraction, which can force a driver to shift attention from paying attention to visual cues to simply listening to directions and back, a proven distraction factor. In short, HUD-based systems can be much more intuitive in delivering navigational information than the traditional displays while keeping the driver safe.

This is why we'd take iPhone 6 Plus for the benchmark, and wouldn't recommend anything larger, since we have little confidence in the performance.Look, although the phone is a bit longer than the accessory cradle, the screen still fits well. Here’s a pic to illustrate it: 

https://hsto.org/files/6bf/a2b/60a/6bfa2b60a0fe4b05a64f45bc90f38c7e.jpg

So, make sure your phone length and width are within 158x77 mm (6.2x3.1 inches) and feel free to make a pledge. Now about phone+case combo. We can't check all the phone model + case model combos. But what we recommend is that the overall weight of your combo is within 300-350 g (10-12 oz) — and most combinations meet this requirement. Beyond that the adjustable mount may get unstable. The compact one will still be OK to some extent. Thus, the advice: know the weight of your phone+case combo.

How does it attach to the dashboard?
Both adjustable and compact mounts stick to the surface — and by surface we mean any dashboard surface — thanks to the industrial strength adhesive. It firmly holds the accessory, and is completely removable, too. 
Are the adhesives reusable?
1. Initially, we planned to make only the adjustable stand adhesive reusable, and the compact one non-reusable. This is because of the different size of the sticky area that attaches to the dashboard — the adjustable mount has a bigger bottom platform. Also, the compact mount in no way interferes with the visibility area, and doesn't require frequent detachments. If we manage to find a reusable adhesive that will work well on a smaller surface area, we'll definitely use it, and thus make both stands reattachable. 2. Mounts ""reusability"" degree will largely depend on how well you wipe the dashboard surface before attaching the mount, and how you store the mounts when you're not using them. As we know that it's almost impossible to make users diligently follow the recommendations we may give on that, we could say that adhesion characteristics of any modern materials would fade quite soon. 
How does it work in daylight?
Looks like the audience doesn't like short answers :) OK guys, here is an abstract of a person who tested HUDWAY Glass prototype (#nofilter #nophotoshop #nocorrections):
«Daytime driving. Performance depends upon time of day and brightness of the sunshine. Let me explain. In general, you can see the image clearly in HUDWAY Glass. Not unexpectedly, the level of detail that you can see at night is not present during daylight hours. Large image objects (arrows, lane markings and such) have good resolution but smaller image objects (text and numbers) may be a bit harder to discern. For example, in Awesome HUD there is a compass that is displayed on top that fades out a bit. This issue can be corrected somewhat by adjusting the angle of the glass but it is still present to some extent. Whenever you drive directly into the sun, the performance degrades significantly to the extent that the smaller image objects disappear. However, the large image objects remain visible. This is to be expected but cannot really be helped unless you can adjust the brightness of the display on your device so that it reflects better onto HUDWAY Glass».
And, this clearly explains why HUDWAY app deliberately avoids small elements (like texts or icons), and shows only the most important info — shows it large. Also, the visual info is supported (or duplicated) with voice assistant.
What about overheating in direct sunlight?
Long journeys in intense summer sunlight blazing in your face may cause phone overheating, yes — please bear in mind that HUDWAY Glass is a passive accessory, and it is not equipped with any temperature sensors and cooling elements. Smartphones have their own methods to detect overheating, switch off and cool down, you may know that. 
Also, air conditioner and cooler temperature inside the car will considerably help the situation. 
Additional note for those who plan to use their old smartphones for that purpose: make sure you don't leave your phone on the dashboard when parking it in hot days under harsh sunlight.
Will it work for motorcycles?
Short answer: no. We'd love to introduce something for motorcycles, but so far can't figure out any universal solution. For that, tech requirements will be rather different — and we need to properly study it to offer a good and safe product.
Why don't you guys equip your accessory with a wireless charger?
We'd love to. The least complicated solution is to add an inductive charger, but the thing is that only a very limited range of smartphone models can benefit from it. For everybody else, it bears zero value. Now, if we start thinking of some really convenient and universal solution — say, a kind of battery, so that HUDWAY Glass cradle could work as a powerbank, — this requires major revisions of the prototype we came to through several series of tests and modifications. And it goes well beyond the product we offer — moreover, it becomes a new product we cannot offer you within this campaign, as it in no sense fits the estimations on production and shipment time.
What apps can I use with HUDWAY Glass? Can I use Waze or Google Maps?
Look guys, it's very simple. The glass in the Glass works like a mirror — and to see the right picture in the mirror, we need the screen image to be reversed. This is what we mean when we say that the app should support HUD mode to be compatible with HUDWAY Glass. Neither Google Maps, nor Waze support this. And it's not us who can do anything about that. For those with jailbroken iPhones, there is a tweak:  http://www.iphonehacks.com/2015/03/how-to-turn-your-iphone-into-an-hud-for-your-car-heads-up-display-mode.html 
For everybody else — sorry guys, no universal cure.
With this said, just a gentle reminder that HUDWAY app works off Google Maps, Apple Maps and OpenStreetMap — these two have pretty good coverage globally. You can switch among these in the app settings, and see which work best for your region. And we don't charge for navigation functions.

We designed and tested the ball to feel like a baseball and perform like a gaming device. Regulation size and weight, with a robust design that can take a beating. The box includes tuners for adjusting weight and balance. The core is made of an impact resistant ABS material and the PU rubber outer gets better the more you play.   
QUICK CONNECT
Handle all connections from within the app. We optimized the way we use Bluetooth for active gaming. The Gaming Baseball updates the phone 70 times every second. You can play at distances of up to 70 yards from the phone. Back in range the ball will update the game. 
Over-the-air upgrade your ball directly from your phone in 20 seconds making the gaming ball smarter.

SMART POWER
How to get the most play out of one standard battery? How about up to 40.000 throws.Over the years we have optimized power management during and after play. No off button to forget. Open the app and press the button to power up the ball. The ball goes into 2 sleep modes to conserve batteries.  


PRODUCTION UNDERWAY
We know we have an amazing product and we pride ourselves in delivery. So we have finished all tooling, testing, and production is under way. This means we are ready to ship the first gaming balls in September 2021 to the first backers and in October onwards to all backers.

This is not our first product and the gaming baseball is built on our proven technology that we first launched in 2018. We have since improved the core tech and the gaming experience based on 1000's of players and over 30 million throws, kicks and jumps.

We have a selection of gloves, a shirt and a cap you can add to any perk, to complete your Backyard League experience.

Having a great glove when playing is an integral part of the experience. We have chosen Rawlings to provide gloves to Backyard League.

Il serait également possible de sélectionner en fonction des allergies.En outre, il serait possible de limiter la recherche à un pays ou à une région particulière (par exemple, afficher uniquement les recettes du Botswana ou afficher uniquement les recettes d'Afrique de l'Ouest) Information nutritionnelle.Pour la création de DishAfrik, on développe une base de données exhaustive avec les informations nutritionnelles des ingrédients utilisés dans les spécialités africaines. Cela garantit que pendant que vous aimez faire les recettes, vous apprenez également à connaître les valeurs nutritionnelles qui vous aident à prendre des décisions alimentaires..Profils de goûtDishAfrik fournit des informations de profil de goût pour les recettes. Il existe actuellement 5 profils gustatifs généralement connus: sucré, salé, acide, amer et umami. Le cas échéant, on identifie et définit des profils gustatifs supplémentaires propres aux recettes. Des informations sur les textures gustatives, telles que croquant, moelleux, etc. seraient également incluses.Informations socioculturellesLes recettes ne se limitent pas aux étapes de cuisson. Les contextes socioculturels des recettes seraient également mis en évidence. Par exemple, si une recette est principalement préparée pour des événements spécifiques, un aliment de base ou toute autre information intéressante concernant la recette.Classes de cuisineDishAfrik fournit une plate-forme pour ceux qui souhaitent partager la façon de cuisiner des recettes africaines avec le monde. Il s'agit d'une session virtuelle où vous pourrez regarder, suivre et poser des questions sur la façon de préparer des recettes trouvées sur DishAfrik.D'autres fonctionnalités à l'horizon incluent des intégrations de commerce électronique, un planificateur de repas, des fonctionnalités sociales, etc. RécompensesEn plus d'aider à donner vie à DishAfrik, selon le montant que vous choisissez de contribuer, vous bénéficiez de certains ou de tous les avantages suivants:

NFT DishAfrik avec recettesNFT de photos de 54 plats avec les recettes 

Remarque sur le NFTNFT signifie jeton non fongible. Il vous permet de prouver numériquement la propriété de choses numériques comme la musique, les arts numériques, etc. Le NFT DishAfrik serait un montage de 54 plats différents de 54 pays différents. L'un ne contient que les images, l'autre contient également la recette.Avec ce NFT, vous pourrez prouver numériquement que vous avez soutenu la campagne indiegogo, tout en ayant un art numérique que vous pouvez conserver ou vendre plus tard. Pourquoi soutenir DishAfrikNotre objectif est d'avoir des recettes des 54 pays sur l'application DishAfrik. Lorsque vous soutenez la campagne, vous aiderez avec la première étape qui est la réalisation du prototype.La prochaine étape serait une collecte de fonds pour la réalisation de la plate-forme.On commence par deux pays de l'Afrique de l'Ouest , puis deux de l'Afrique de l'Est, deux de l'Afrique francophone, deux de l'Afrique australe puis deux de l'Afrique du Nord.Après cela, on poursuit une stratégie d'expansion pour couvrir les 54 pays en Afrique.Les fonds collectés dans cette campagne nous aideront à faire le premiers pas vers cet objectif. Les fonds serviront à financer des activités suivantes :
Mettre en place l'infrastructure technique de base,
Ajouter plus de 200 recettes du Nigeria et du Ghana,
Implémenter les fonctionnalités de recherche.
Établir une base de données de profils nutritionnels et gustatifs. Cela sera rassemblé à partir des données obtenues de l'USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) 
 Rencontrer l'équipeDade Aderemi est responsable de tout ce qui concerne la technologie. Il aime ""vivre la diversité"", découvrir différentes cultures et voyager. Il a visité au moins un pays sur tous les continents sauf l'Amérique du Sud, l'Antarctique et l'Océanie. Il prévoit de se rendre en Amérique du Sud quand la pandémie de covid se termine (l'Antarctique et l'Océanie au futur). Il est néerlandais-nigérian et réside actuellement à Amsterdam, aux Pays-Bas.Mary Maamah est responsable de toutes les opérations. A son avis, participer est non seulement amusant mais il faut aussi vivre la diversité. En plus de son travail et expérience professionnelle dans la finance et la domaine juridique, elle dirige également une entreprise de cuisine de chez elle. Elle est ghanéenne et habite à Accra Risques et défisOn travaille tous les deux à temps plein, tout en développant dans le même temps DishAfrik. Grâce à cette campagne, les fonds collectés nous permettraient d'avoir une ou deux journées de travail focalisées sur DishAfrik, en dehors des soirées et week-ends que nous passons déjà.Pour cette raison, le développement ne serait pas assez rapide si nous travaillions à temps plein. D'autre façons de contribuerVous pouvez également nous aider en diffusant cette campagne au sein de votre réseau et également sur les réseaux sociaux..",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are in the Final Stage of Production and are asking for $15,000.  After spending tens of thousands on the samples and prototype stages, we are in need of your help to bring the product over the finish line. </p>
<p>We are offering a discount for all supporters of the campaign.  We are including a cleaning cloth to keep your mirror clean for all supporters.  For multiple orders, we are offering cleaning cloths and screen protectors.  All funds received will be going towards the Production Stage for the initial orders.  We hope to exceed our goal.  Exceeding our goal will help create more tooling machines to be able to produce more cases for other cell phones. </p>
<p>With each new cell phone, a new tooling machine has to be made.  That machine is made out of iron and steel and costs thousands of dollars to make.  To note, each case has its own individual tooling machine.  One tooling machine can not make an XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and so on.  It can only make one cell phone per tooling machine.  The sizes are all just a little bit different from the others.   With extra funding, we will be able to have more tooling machines to make more cell cases for more cell phones.</p>

How It All Began
 

 

Where Your Support Is Going

We are in the Final Stage of Production and are asking for $15,000.  After spending tens of thousands on the samples and prototype stages, we are in need of your help to bring the product over the finish line. 
We are offering a discount for all supporters of the campaign.  We are including a cleaning cloth to keep your mirror clean for all supporters.  For multiple orders, we are offering cleaning cloths and screen protectors.  All funds received will be going towards the Production Stage for the initial orders.  We hope to exceed our goal.  Exceeding our goal will help create more tooling machines to be able to produce more cases for other cell phones. 
With each new cell phone, a new tooling machine has to be made.  That machine is made out of iron and steel and costs thousands of dollars to make.  To note, each case has its own individual tooling machine.  One tooling machine can not make an XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max, and so on.  It can only make one cell phone per tooling machine.  The sizes are all just a little bit different from the others.   With extra funding, we will be able to have more tooling machines to make more cell cases for more cell phones.

<div> </div>
<p>With limited smartphone battery capacity, daily power bank use has become ubiquitous so we have designed the best one for you. SMARTCOBY is not only extremely compact but also has multiple functions. SMARTCOBY will definitely make your lifestyle more convenient.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Current State of Mobile Batteries</h3>
<p> As high-spec smartphones and tablets are becoming more and more popular, we at CIO Co., Ltd. feel that many power banks have not yet caught up with the evolution of smartphones. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576933866/r5eib8mtoceqgky0bc51.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have sold tens of thousands of our products in Japan so far and currently, the strongest feeling we have received from our customers is that they are not 100% satisfied with current products.</p>
<p>People using other branded power banks complain that:</p>
<p>""I’m a little worried because of its low capacity, but it is okay as long as it is light…!""</p>
<p>""This power bank is really heavy but I feel covered because of its high capacity and quick charge technology.""</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Challenge to Achieve Both Compactness and High-spec </h3>
<p>In the market today, implementing single-function power banks is no longer difficult. We can easily make lightweight power banks, large capacity power banks, and quick charge power banks. However, there are some disadvantages.</p>
<ul>
<li> Lightweight power banks often have only small capacity and are often depleted after one charge leaving the user without backup if recharging the power bank has been forgotten. </li>
<li>Large capacity power banks are heavy. </li>
<li>There are very few quick charge technology power banks and practically none are lightweight ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>""CIO Co., Ltd."" has succeeded in developing the ideal power bank by striving to attain 100% customer satisfaction. We have developed various new technologies through this project, such as lithium battery technology, transformer technology, and we have also improved the quality of the battery. Finally, we have succeeded in developing a power bank that is close to perfect!</p>
<p>It is lightweight and small; moreover, it has both a large capacity and high-spec integration! It is an unprecedented power bank in every way. Here, we introduce to you, SMARTCOBY!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576933919/ji1q99hhzt69bg26mvhx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Developing Ideal Power Banks</h3>
<p>Which kind of power bank is the most convenient?—The answer is a power bank which is suitable for daily use. Since almost everyone is using power banks for various purposes, the standard for ""suitable for daily use"" is very high.</p>
<p>Lightweight and compactness are major requirements, but if the installed capacity is 5,000mAh or less, it will not be able to charge current smartphones even once, and will have to be charged daily.</p>
<p>This will become tedious, and eventually the battery will end up being unused at home, or forgotten in a bag or backpack with no charge. Also, if charging takes too long, it may end up being replaced for a heavier (but larger capacity) power bank. </p>
<p>If a different cable from smartphones is required, this will also lead to issues:</p>
<p>If it becomes necessary to carry around additional cables for the power banks, people may forget to bring the cables and they cannot charge their smartphones.</p>
<p>If the cables are broken once, they have to get a new one or they cannot use the power banks.</p>
<p>SMARTCOBY has cleared the essential requirements for daily use, and our power banks have better and more functions than before. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphone-kaitori.shop/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/detail_7396_15675774936870.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>01. Compact and Ultra Light</h3>
<p>What satisfies you the most about daily use power banks? Small and lightweight power banks are the ideal power banks. With the latest LiNiMnCo (NMC) batteries, we have succeeded in producing safer and lighter weight power bank, compared to others on the market. </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphone-kaitori.shop/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/detail_7396_15680075397469.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>SMARTCOBY weighs in at an incredible 0.3lbs, much lighter than the iPhone. Due to this, it adds little weight to your bag without the bulk and will not take much space on your desk.</p>
<p>SMARTCOBY guarantees space-saving power banks. </p> <h3>02. Charge Your Smartphone More than Twice</h3>
<p>If the capacity of your power bank is 2000-3000mAh, no matter how compact your battery is, it will not be able to charge a smartphone fully because modern smartphone batteries are hungry for more power. You may be deceived if you think charging once is enough. </p>
<p>Ideally, fully charging your power bank daily will assure you have the needed backup power, but this is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Have you ever accidentally forgotten to charge your power bank and find your power bank is depleted when you need it the most?</p>
<p>In fact, the ideal capacity of power bank is the one that can charge your phone at least twice. Remember the larger the power bank capacity can be heavier. This makes most high-capacity power banks  unsuitable for daily use.</p>
<p>The credit-card sized SMARTCOBY, has succeeded in developing 8,000mAh capacity*.</p>
<p>*10,000mAh version is also available.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576934185/kdhhcumvpfkn80bao4ye.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> 03. Quick Charge Technology</h3>
<p>Quick charge is often overlooked but actually is a very important point. Today's smartphones are compatible with all kinds of quick charge technologies, so if power banks have less than 5V/2.4A of output, it will not be able to meet the charging performance of this generation of smartphones.</p>
<p>It is such a waste that your smartphones are compatible with quick charge technology, but most power banks do not incorporate or provide quick charge technology.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphone-kaitori.shop/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imageonline-gifspeed.gif"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphone-kaitori.shop/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/imageonline-gifspeed-2.gif"" src=""""/><p>""SMARTCOBY"" is compatible with Power Delivery 3.0 and Quick Charge4+ (QC3.0 backward compatible), so it can quickly charge on both iPhone and Android devices.</p>
<p>SMARTCOBY can quick charge an iPhoneXS to about 50% capacity in only 30 minutes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576980238/swfz7t03mwytk1zssmvx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition, it is also compatible with Macbooks and iPad Pro charging as it supports 18W output.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576934226/daxpilqlz5clof5ldxyk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>04. Rapid Charging of Power Banks</h3>
<p>If the power bank charging speed is slow, its effectiveness will be halved even though the capacity is large.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the recharging speed of the power bank is fast, you can recharge it to 40% capacity in only an hour. Even if you forget to charge it at night, you can quickly charge it the morning and it's ready for the day.</p>
<p>""SMARTCOBY"" supports 18W rapid power recharging to the power banks, so you can fully charge it in just two and a half hours.</p>
<p>Note: In order to operate 18W rapid power charging, you need to use an adapter and a cable compatible with PD or QC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577099727/fk07ctodh3miaa1nvffs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>05. Multi-function</h3>
<p><strong>Pass-Through Charging:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to charge both your phone and your power bank with only one outlet, pass-through charging enables you to charge both your smartphone and recharge the power bank. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> Compatible with USB-C and Lightning Input:</strong></p>
<p>Generally, you need a Micro USB cable to charge most other power banks. Therefore, both iPhone and Android users must carry a dedicated cable for that power banks, which is very inconvenient.</p>
<p>By contrast, ""SMARTCOBY"" can be charged by either Lightning cables or USB-C cables. Android users can use USB-C cables, and iPhone users can use Lightning cables to charge SMARTCOBY, eliminating the need to carry two cables.</p>
<p> </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://smartphone-kaitori.shop/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/detail_7396_15675772986870.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<h3>06. Convenient Accessories for Daily Use</h3>
<p><strong>Strap-hole</strong>: You can attach it a key ring or a hanging strap*, giving you flexibility.  </p>
<p>*Only 8000mAh models have a strap hole: not available on 10,000mAh models.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576980345/dic9uqrlcaxmocm2bx4g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

With limited smartphone battery capacity, daily power bank use has become ubiquitous so we have designed the best one for you. SMARTCOBY is not only extremely compact but also has multiple functions. SMARTCOBY will definitely make your lifestyle more convenient.


 
Current State of Mobile Batteries
 As high-spec smartphones and tablets are becoming more and more popular, we at CIO Co., Ltd. feel that many power banks have not yet caught up with the evolution of smartphones. 

We have sold tens of thousands of our products in Japan so far and currently, the strongest feeling we have received from our customers is that they are not 100% satisfied with current products.
People using other branded power banks complain that:
""I’m a little worried because of its low capacity, but it is okay as long as it is light…!""
""This power bank is really heavy but I feel covered because of its high capacity and quick charge technology.""
 
Our Challenge to Achieve Both Compactness and High-spec 
In the market today, implementing single-function power banks is no longer difficult. We can easily make lightweight power banks, large capacity power banks, and quick charge power banks. However, there are some disadvantages.

 Lightweight power banks often have only small capacity and are often depleted after one charge leaving the user without backup if recharging the power bank has been forgotten. 
Large capacity power banks are heavy. 
There are very few quick charge technology power banks and practically none are lightweight ones.

""CIO Co., Ltd."" has succeeded in developing the ideal power bank by striving to attain 100% customer satisfaction. We have developed various new technologies through this project, such as lithium battery technology, transformer technology, and we have also improved the quality of the battery. Finally, we have succeeded in developing a power bank that is close to perfect!
It is lightweight and small; moreover, it has both a large capacity and high-spec integration! It is an unprecedented power bank in every way. Here, we introduce to you, SMARTCOBY!

 
CIO Co., Ltd. has been featured in:

Developing Ideal Power Banks
Which kind of power bank is the most convenient?—The answer is a power bank which is suitable for daily use. Since almost everyone is using power banks for various purposes, the standard for ""suitable for daily use"" is very high.
Lightweight and compactness are major requirements, but if the installed capacity is 5,000mAh or less, it will not be able to charge current smartphones even once, and will have to be charged daily.
This will become tedious, and eventually the battery will end up being unused at home, or forgotten in a bag or backpack with no charge. Also, if charging takes too long, it may end up being replaced for a heavier (but larger capacity) power bank. 
If a different cable from smartphones is required, this will also lead to issues:
If it becomes necessary to carry around additional cables for the power banks, people may forget to bring the cables and they cannot charge their smartphones.
If the cables are broken once, they have to get a new one or they cannot use the power banks.
SMARTCOBY has cleared the essential requirements for daily use, and our power banks have better and more functions than before. 
 
Features of SMARTCOBY

Compact: 2.6x3.5x0.5inches (65x90x13mm)
Super lightweight: 0.3lbs (137g) the same as 2 eggs!
Compatible with PD 3.0 and QC4+, quick charge technology for the next generation.
MacBook compatible.
Multiple-functions are compatible with many devices.


 
01. Compact and Ultra Light
What satisfies you the most about daily use power banks? Small and lightweight power banks are the ideal power banks. With the latest LiNiMnCo (NMC) batteries, we have succeeded in producing safer and lighter weight power bank, compared to others on the market.   
SMARTCOBY weighs in at an incredible 0.3lbs, much lighter than the iPhone. Due to this, it adds little weight to your bag without the bulk and will not take much space on your desk.
SMARTCOBY guarantees space-saving power banks.  02. Charge Your Smartphone More than Twice
If the capacity of your power bank is 2000-3000mAh, no matter how compact your battery is, it will not be able to charge a smartphone fully because modern smartphone batteries are hungry for more power. You may be deceived if you think charging once is enough. 
Ideally, fully charging your power bank daily will assure you have the needed backup power, but this is unrealistic.
Have you ever accidentally forgotten to charge your power bank and find your power bank is depleted when you need it the most?
In fact, the ideal capacity of power bank is the one that can charge your phone at least twice. Remember the larger the power bank capacity can be heavier. This makes most high-capacity power banks  unsuitable for daily use.
The credit-card sized SMARTCOBY, has succeeded in developing 8,000mAh capacity*.
*10,000mAh version is also available.

 03. Quick Charge Technology
Quick charge is often overlooked but actually is a very important point. Today's smartphones are compatible with all kinds of quick charge technologies, so if power banks have less than 5V/2.4A of output, it will not be able to meet the charging performance of this generation of smartphones.
It is such a waste that your smartphones are compatible with quick charge technology, but most power banks do not incorporate or provide quick charge technology. ""SMARTCOBY"" is compatible with Power Delivery 3.0 and Quick Charge4+ (QC3.0 backward compatible), so it can quickly charge on both iPhone and Android devices.
SMARTCOBY can quick charge an iPhoneXS to about 50% capacity in only 30 minutes. 

In addition, it is also compatible with Macbooks and iPad Pro charging as it supports 18W output.
04. Rapid Charging of Power Banks
If the power bank charging speed is slow, its effectiveness will be halved even though the capacity is large.
On the other hand, if the recharging speed of the power bank is fast, you can recharge it to 40% capacity in only an hour. Even if you forget to charge it at night, you can quickly charge it the morning and it's ready for the day.
""SMARTCOBY"" supports 18W rapid power recharging to the power banks, so you can fully charge it in just two and a half hours.
Note: In order to operate 18W rapid power charging, you need to use an adapter and a cable compatible with PD or QC.
 

 
05. Multi-function
Pass-Through Charging:
If you want to charge both your phone and your power bank with only one outlet, pass-through charging enables you to charge both your smartphone and recharge the power bank. 
 
 Compatible with USB-C and Lightning Input:
Generally, you need a Micro USB cable to charge most other power banks. Therefore, both iPhone and Android users must carry a dedicated cable for that power banks, which is very inconvenient.
By contrast, ""SMARTCOBY"" can be charged by either Lightning cables or USB-C cables. Android users can use USB-C cables, and iPhone users can use Lightning cables to charge SMARTCOBY, eliminating the need to carry two cables.
   
06. Convenient Accessories for Daily Use
Strap-hole: You can attach it a key ring or a hanging strap*, giving you flexibility.  
*Only 8000mAh models have a strap hole: not available on 10,000mAh models.

Storage Pouch and Cable Tie: We want you to use ""SMARTCOBY"" every day, so we are particular about the accessories. As a supporter of the ""SMARTCOBY"" campaign, you will receive a mesh fabric draw-string storage pouch. This pouch will make carrying the ""SMARTCOBY"" even more convenient.  In addition, a leather cable tie that can be attached to the strap hole is also available*. This makes keeping the ""SMARTCOBY"" cable neat and untangled in your bag.
* The 10000mAh model does not have a hanging strap and a cable tie. Only the storage pouch is included.
 
Choice of 8,000mAh models or 10,000mAh models
8,000mAh is simple single-tone surface to suit your daily life.
10,000mAh features a shiny rubber coating and TPE on the side to make the surface stand out; an enjoyable design.
Either model is recommended, please choose depending on your purpose and preferences.

At the same time, we’re investing into a reforestation project in the Peruvian Amazon.We need tons of different cables and connectors to charge all our devices. Cheap materials and poor design lead to cables that break easily -- a great excuse for companies to keep producing and selling more.   Making these cables has a major environmental impact, and their supply chains hide a number of serious issues. For example, the electronics industry releases as much CO2 as all airplanes worldwide and the illegal mining of metals used in electronics is a major cause of deforestation in the Amazon. Simplify chargingNever worry about having the wrong cable for your different devices. Support all your devicesA single cable that works with all your Apple and Android devices, plus laptops and micro USB accessories. Fewer cablesOne clean, durable solution saves money and reduces clutter, plus cuts your environmental impact. Easy to useSimply plug in the connectors and you’ll always have the right cable with you. Made for sharingSave the day with the cable that’s perfect for you and your friend’s devices - no matter what brand they prefer!SecureMade with the strongest commercially available magnets. Use with one handConnect quickly and easily, even if you only have one hand free. Protect your devicesNo more snags or damage caused by catching cables.The last cable you needNylon braiding (100% recycled!) and extended strain relief improve toughness and durability.  Gold-plated connectors18k gold-plated connectors ensure stable, long-lasting connections. Fairtrade isn’t just about farming -- it improves accountability and working conditions for miners, too! Because our cables contain gold, we're working with Fairtrade to support gold miners in Peru.Fairtrade gold is sourced exclusively from small-scale mines that meet the Fairtrade Gold Standard: an internationally recognised best-practice indicator for workers’ rights and environmental protection. Fair payWorkers in Fairtrade-certified gold mines receive a guaranteed Fairtrade Minimum Price for their product. Buying our cable means you're supporting fair incomes for small-scale miners. SafetySmall-scale mining is a dangerous occupation which often involves working in small, dark and poorly ventilated tunnels. Fairtrade raises awareness of health and safety risks and ensures proper safety equipment and policies are in place.All electronics use tin solder to join components. Tin mining is known to fund wars, employ child labour and cause environmental damage, which is why it’s important to care where it comes from. Responsibly sourcedWe source all our solder from a company called Stannol.

This product has been created by a developer who experienced firsthand the many problems of using two smartphone devices (including damages, loss, and storage). We’ve solved the inconveniences of using just one phone while working on two or more tasks: which involves hiding the currently operating screen, running another task, and bringing up the previous screen again to continue the first task.Utilizing two screens with two phones help people who require high use of mobile phones throughout the day due to work and other demands where they need to handle various tasks promptly and simultaneously.You can simultaneously carry out various tasks (calls/ writing documents/ Internet/ apps/ taking photos & videos/ music/ SNS chatting/ games, etc.), including sending and receiving video feedback in real-time while working, contacting others with texts and chats while internet searching, and being active on social media while watching Youtube.The convenience of this is in a different league to using typical phone cases or carrying around two phones separately. It’s the smartest way to handle work swiftly.One-phone users, as well as existing two-phone users, can also add a spare phone to enjoy the Internet on two screens via Hotspot or WIFI, which will improve work efficiency and pleasure.The Duo-Phone Case will serve as a useful product for general office workers, sales jobs (insurance sales, vehicle sales, other sales positions), transport jobs (freight transport, taxi driving, shipping, etc.), general salespeople (wholesale and retail traders, distributors, warehouseman, etc.), specialists (brokers, practitioners in law/medicine/education, etc.), the general public (students, housewives, freelancers, etc.) and their affiliated associations, organizations, companies, and more.The extremely practical “NEWMIRE DUO PHONECASE” that saves valuable time and maximizes work efficiency, elevating the quality of your life.    The “NEWMIRE DUO PHONECASE” enables fast transitions between one-phone/ two-phone/ closed status.The “two-phone status” that supports consecutive tasking offers the view of two phones laid alongside each other, maximizing the speed and efficiency of work processing.

You can use it for all cellphone models that are smaller than the one-sided size of the case’s body. A type OnlyThe wallet type case allows the storage of cards, cash, and name cards inside, all at the same time. Its size is compact and slim enough to fit in your pockets. You can attach and remove it to and from any area made of metal by using the magnet embedded in the phone case. For example, you can attach the phone to a fridge while washing dishes at home and playing music or videos, or do the housework while talking on your phone. You can also do simple repetitive work like packaging or storage while making work-related calls at the same time. The case also features a slider. So you can shoot photos and videos, even while the mobile phone stays in the case, by pushing up the slider with one hand.   “NEWMIRE DUO PHONECASE” comes in 7 colors and 2 different types. Between the 2 types, the A type is a wallet-type product featuring 8 card insertions and 4 cash-inserting pockets, and the B type is a product without the wallet feature.Both types are able to accommodate two phones simultaneously.

Works with all the world's best selling smartphone accessories
By far the most affordable all-in-one solution on the market
Made in The USA!
 At the heart of Modmount is our patent pending, Friction Fit locking connection, which allows you to use, carry, and charge your smartphone — with your favorite accessories, hands-free and on-the-go like never before!Everything is available in BLACK and WHITE.​ Compatible AccessoriesIf you own a Popsocket, Loopy Case, or Finger Ring, there has been no way to fully integrate it into your active lifestyle. Until now.Our ultra-slim (2.1mm) Universal Adapter attaches to the back of most smartphones and cases with industrial strength 3M adhesive and is wide enough for your favorite accessory.Gone are the days of choosing between either your favorite accessory or a mounting system. With Modmount, you can have it all!  MagSafe...has a problem: the magnets aren’t strong enough to endure the rigors of an active lifestyle. Enter Modmount!The MagSafe charging puck fits seamlessly in to each mount, allowing you to wirelessly charge any phone, not just the iPhone 12, on the go with your new Apple MagSafe charger. Further, Apple throttles third party wireless charging accessories from 15 watts down to 7.5 watts (for safety reasons). That makes Modmount the world’s only mounting system capable of wirelessly charging the iPhone 12 at 15 watts. So if you just purchased the iPhone 12, you’re in luck! With Modmount you can charge your smartphone twice as fast as you can with any other system. The Mounts Shoot portrait or landscape, interchangeably — with the Tripod Mount. Carry your phone on any backpack strap, belt, sling, or fanny pack — with the Strap Mount. FaceTime hands-free — with the Wall Mount. Track your ride — with the Bike Mount. Navigate at a glance — with the Vent Mount. Keep your phone handy while exercising — with the Armband Mount. Modmount is for you if...

It is the king of instant power!
It has two of the highest 100W & 65W Input / Output USB-C PD ports for starters. Then, in spite of being super compact and lightweight, it also has two 22W & 18W USB-A QC 3.0 ports and one 10W built-in wireless charging pad. So it can charge 5 devices at the same time with universal compatibility.
 Review Video by OSReviews  SUPER has world's highest 100W  & 65W USB-C PD 3.0 output. Those unrivaled PD ports make SUPER has highest PD output among powerbanks while most of the competition struggles to even reach single 60W. With the 100W USB-C PD port, SUPER can charge your devices that require a high input, such as MacBook Pro 16"" or Wacom MobileStudio Pro 16"", all at (100W) top speed.  SUPER charge MacBook Pro 16"" (100Wh total) from 0% to 80% in 1 hour only.SUPER has more of everything! It has not only 1 but 2 USB-C PD ports.  The 100W and 65W USB-C PD ports of SUPER enable it to charge 2 MacBook Pro 13"" (61W) at top speed（65W each). These PD ports make SUPER the highest PD output in the world of powerbanks, given that most of the competition struggle to provide even a single 60W port. SUPER has 2 industry-leading powerful 22W & 18W USB-A Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 ports that support all major fast charge protocols including Apple, Samsung, HUAWEI, Vivo, Oppo and OnePlus.SUPER charges your smart devices 4 times faster than others.But what if you forget your cable?Don’t worry! SUPER’s 10 W wireless charging pad charges all compatible devices quickly and cable-free! SUPER's 10W no-mess, no-fuss wireless charging output has a greater capacity than most smartphones require, e.g., 7.5W of iPhone 11, and it charges 1.5 times faster than most wireless charging pads, which is way faster than you could expect! To recap some of SUPER’s outstanding features: it has not only has 2 USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 ports but also 2 USB-A ports and even a wireless charging pad. SUPER can charge up to 5 devices at the same time!If you’re wondering what kinds of devices SUPER can charge – the only limit is your imagination! Devices include smartphones, laptops, cameras, Nintendo switch, AirPods Pro, Tablet, Bluetooth Speaker and Wireless Mouse and the list goes on . SUPER puts an end to family arguments and workplace stress because there is no need to argue over who gets to charge their device first, with SUPER you can charge them all.Being the world's fastest charging powerbank would mean nothing if the capacity was tiny. With SUPER we are proud to say that as well as being the world's fastest powerbank, SUPER also has a huge 26,800mAh(99Wh) capacity.So, how many times can SUPER fully charge all these popular devices. With SUPER's 26,800mAh huge capacity, your devices can be fully charged in multiple times. But what if you still want to know the exact running time you can expect from SUPER for your devices?​ The mega 26,800 mAh capacity means SUPER can fully charge your iPhone 11 up to 8 times for close to one week of usage, or enable MacBook Pro 13""(58wh) to run for an extra 18 hours approximately. So when you’re out and about you don’t need to panic about finding available outlets at a café or restaurant anymore! SUPER keeps your device working.Nobody cares about a powerbank with a huge capacity if it takes forever to recharge. Above all else SUPER saves you time. It can fully recharge in only 1.7 hours by using the 100W compatible cable and charger. It saves you 4.8 hours compared to the usual mainstream 18W input. And you can recharge SUPER using its 65W PD port while still actively charging a device via its 100W PD port. But what about smartphones?Rush hour for most people is the start of the day when you need all your devices ready to use. And not everyone has the 1.5-hour recharge of their laptop during rush hour. But the 10 minutes recharging time SUPER requires to top up your smartphone – that’s do-able! You can get full power on your iPhone 11 (3,110mAh) by recharging with SUPER in just 10 minutes! That’s your busy day covered!To save your even more time, SUPER’s unbeatable combination of a 100W & a 65W USB-C PD port support pass through charging so you can charge your devices AND SUPER at the same time, through a single power outlet.  It’s worth mentioning again - With the world's fastest charging & recharging speed, SUPER is the world's fastest powerbank.Nobody wants to carry a monster size powerbank around all day. Amazingly, SUPER is pocket size.  To To give you some perception of SUPER’s compact size, it measures 184.5mm in length x 85mm in width x 25 mm in thickness（7.26“x 3.35""x 1""), which is about two-thirds of the Nintendo Switch. That means it’s sufficiently compact for you to put it in your pocket or bag. And being neatly pocket sized, with a huge recharging capacity, does not mean it’s a heavyweight. SUPER weighs a mere 580g (1.28 lbs) only, which means it is genuinely portable for everyone!The top-class quality of SUPER extends all the way to the high-quality Panasonic™ batteries that are incorporated in SUPER. These batteries are widely used in Tesla™ electric vehicles.Known for being safety-oriented, these batteries not only extend battery life, they maintain a far higher durability than conventional powerbanks, which equates to far less power loss over a long period of use, i.e., 80% capacity remains even after 1,000 battery cycles.Your safety is more than everything. So we use high quality material for both interior and exterior part with multiple protection. We proudly offer a multi-protection guarantee for the safety of you, your devices and SUPER. And all electronic products should be subjected to rigorous industrial testing quality products in order to achieve international certification, however many are not or do not pass. SUPER, however, has been quality tested for safety and reliability.SUPER is made of aircraft grade aluminum which you will only see in the construction of aeroplanes and some select high-end luggage. This commitment to quality is what makes SUPER a stand-out in the market, for its incredible lightweight and intensely durable construction.  So how does SUPER blow the competition out of the water? Check this out.Even the most valiant of Knights needs to have the best horse! Now introducing SUPER’s faithful side-kick, the ultra-compact 100W GaN charger for recharging SUPER.SUPER 100W GaN charger has not only 1 but 2 USB-C PD 3.0 ports. It can charge 1 device by 100W output or 2 devices 45W output each. The credit card size 100W GaN charger is 50% lighter compared to the MacBook 96W charger – it doesn’t get more portable than that! You can charge the MacBook Pro 16""(96W) at top speed just like using the Apple's charger which makes GaN a rare and much appreciated compatible tool! SUPER GaN charger is clever in its own right – with two USB-C PD ports - so you can charge your laptop or smartphone with 45W output while recharging the SUPER with 45W speed.  Here's how the math works. This chart shows SUPER's total output when charging multiple devices simultaneously.We designed SUPER, knowing full well the needs of our users because they are exactly the same as our needs! Like everyone, we also rely on communicating via our devices to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family every day.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Declutter:</strong></u></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We wanted our device to cut down on desk clutter by providing a central point where all devices could be charged. So we added the vertical wireless charging coils and a charging pad so that wireless enabled devices could be charged with ease. We added two USB ports to the back of the device to make it easier to charge multiple devices at once.</h3>

Say Hello to the D5.


THE 4-IN-1 FAST WIRELESS CHARGING DOCKING STATION AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKER
 

 

 

 

 
What is the Dockall D5?
The Dockall D5 is a 4-in-1 sound system, fast wireless charger, docking station, and speakerphone. Created as the ultimate companion for all of your devices. Designed with an eye on the future with industrial grade durable materials.
 

 
 
 
Why We Are Making the D5?
Declutter:
We wanted our device to cut down on desk clutter by providing a central point where all devices could be charged. So we added the vertical wireless charging coils and a charging pad so that wireless enabled devices could be charged with ease. We added two USB ports to the back of the device to make it easier to charge multiple devices at once.
 

 

 

 
Create the perfect companion for remote Work:
With the modern popularity of virtual meeting applications like Zoom and Microsoft Teams, we knew our device had to offer a solution that could accommodate these types of communication platforms. That’s why the DockAll D5 has an upgraded Near Field Microphone with Active Noise Cancelation to make virtual conferencing easy and efficient.  The D5’s two 8 Watt Bluetooth speakers ensure that any audio coming from a connected device is clear and high in fidelity.
 



 
 
 

 
 
 



 

 
Designed With the Future in Mind:
As we move towards the future we wanted to create something that would stand the test of time not only in terms of durability but in terms of design as well. This desire made us seek out space age materials to use in the design and production of the D5. The D5 is made out of a durable industrial strength plastic with rubberized texturing on the charging pad and brushed metal accenting the control panel.
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
An Enhanced User Experience:
From our previous endeavors we knew that one of the most important aspects of any consumer solution is the user’s experience, that’s why we added an LED light strip outlining the front of the D5, which illuminates when a user’s device is being charged. Not only does this feature ensure that anyone using the D5 knows when their device is charging, but we also think it just looks really cool. 
 
 

 
 

 
 


 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
Who We Are and Why We Are Here?
2020 was an unexpected year that saw a massive increase in individuals working from home. This trend doesn’t appear to be decreasing as we move forward. According to Forbes “By 2025, an estimated 70% of the workforce will be working remotely at least five days a month.” This massive shift in work from home caused many professionals to have to scramble to find the right equipment necessary to set up a suitable home office. Many needed to have a set up that enabled them to participate in Zoom and Teams conferences in order to stay in touch with their coworkers. These hardships inspired us to start designing a device that could provide anyone with the tools necessary to work from home successfully.
We set out to make a device that could acts as a hub for all devices while providing the tools necessary to communicate virtually with coworkers. A device we affectionately call the
DockAll D5.
 


 

What We Need & What You Get
In order to bring this dream to life, we need your help! We are currently working on a production ready prototype but need a little help for the final push. We are asking for help to raise the funds necessary to put the first few hundred units into production. 
Once production begins the D5 will retail at $99.99
For our supporters we will be offering the D5 at the Early-Bird Cost of $79.99

First off all, I want to note the idea of creating a built-in wireless charger, because this is a very useful thing. Well done for doing it. But put charger on the left side, as it is more convenient. There are now far fewer cables on my desk, which has a positive effect on the usability of the desk pad. It is a very nice size pad and it provides great protection and it’s very easy to write on. I Recommend it! (Kevin)</p><p> </p><p>--- This natural leather office desk pad is really nice and has no smell, unlike PU or vegan leather. It covers a generous area under my keyboard and doubles as a mouse pad. It looks expensive but can be purchased for a nominal price. It is easy to clean or roll up and take with me for travel. I like it a lot! (Tom)</p><p> </p><p>--- This is a very nice waterproof desk pad. I am on the internet frequently and so I bring my food and drinks with me. The desk I place my computer on is nice and I needed some type of waterproof pad that would protect the desk. I simply wipe it down with a damp cloth to keep it clean. It comes with a built-in wireless charger which is very convenient and useful!

How do we solve this problem? Easy, just say ... Bye-Bye Chaos  Hi LeMat Here we introduce a Genuine Leather mat that will suit every person’s needs, LeMat. We have done our best to make your online work easier and we have found the best solution on how to organize your workspace so that you can work as effectively as possible.         We add new colors     LeMat Comparison with other desk mats - We Recommend You Read!    LeMat allow you to reduce clutter in order to organize your workspace. By doing this, it will enable you to focus on your tasks without any forms of distraction. Also the mat is aesthetically pleasing!    LeMat has a Built-in Wireless Charger and uses the Qi charging standard which is compatible with almost all devices including phones, AirPods which have wireless charging enabled.     A lot of people have issues with being unable to locate their pen and USB cable at the time, as a result of this, we made a mount for these things. You’ll always have quick access to your work essentials, whenever you need them.    LeMat can transform any desk into a comfortable workspace as it provides your device with a smooth hard surface which is excellent for both writing and computer use when using a mouse. The mat is steady and does not slip around the table. It is evenly smooth and is very pleasant to the touch.    The mat is very functional as it can fit in a bag when easily rolled up which makes it portable. Roll and place or stack and go.    LeMat offers protection to your desk and prevents any scratching, staining and spills. The natural leather is durable and water-repellent and can easily be cleaned with a cloth.     This product is created from premium natural leather from Italy. It retains the marks of hide and the mat is kept unpolished. This is to make sure that with age, it develops a rich and natural patina. Each mat is manually verified which enables us to create a high-quality product, avoiding any defects. Beauty and quality are as important as functionality.    Here is a special offer for you! We can engrave and personalize your mat with a name or other text!        Compare LeMat and other desk pads        Thank you very much for your ""LeMat overview"", it is awesome!   Our testers Feedbacks --- Well, I received the prototype of the desk pad and I tested it. First off all, I want to note the idea of creating a built-in wireless charger, because this is a very useful thing. Well done for doing it. But put charger on the left side, as it is more convenient. There are now far fewer cables on my desk, which has a positive effect on the usability of the desk pad. It is a very nice size pad and it provides great protection and it’s very easy to write on. I Recommend it! (Kevin) --- This natural leather office desk pad is really nice and has no smell, unlike PU or vegan leather. It covers a generous area under my keyboard and doubles as a mouse pad. It looks expensive but can be purchased for a nominal price. It is easy to clean or roll up and take with me for travel. I like it a lot! (Tom) --- This is a very nice waterproof desk pad. I am on the internet frequently and so I bring my food and drinks with me. The desk I place my computer on is nice and I needed some type of waterproof pad that would protect the desk. I simply wipe it down with a damp cloth to keep it clean. It comes with a built-in wireless charger which is very convenient and useful! (John)              Hello everyone.

<h3>GaN Technology</h3>
<p>A new power semiconductor material - gallium nitride (GaN) - runs up to 20x faster than old, slow silicon (Si) chips, delivering up to 3x more power conversion and half the size and weight. GaNFast power ICs from Navitas Semiconductor enables the SlimQ F100 fast charger to reach world-class 94% efficiency, which means a cool operation in a small size. For more information on GaN, see <a href=""http://www.GaNFast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.GaNFast.com</a>.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588141439/ehrawuslbrgwjwwgez2p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Complete PFC Circuit</h3>
<p>SlimQ F100 includes a Power factor correction (PFC) circuit. The purpose of PFC is to improve the power factor which means power quality. Although the PFC circuit increases the charger size significantly, it increases energy efficiency, reduces electricity costs, and reduces the load on the electricity system. For adapters that have higher than 75W capacity, the PFC function is necessarily required by government regulations all over the world. With the PFC circuit, SlimQ F100 has a PF value of &gt;0.95 compare to ~0.45 for chargers without PFC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588755909/hc2bco4xraltgwebew1j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>The presence of PFC also makes our charger more environment friendly compared to one without it. Assume the charger is used 10 hours a day and 300 days a year, compared to one without PFC, our charger can save 230KWHr electricity, which is equivalent to 227 pounds of carbon emission. It takes ten trees to offset that amount of carbon emission.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>When Design Meets Engineering</h3>
<p>We believe design is essential and even the center of a product. We designed the SlimQ F100 with multiple use case scenarios in mind. We paid attention to subtle details that might affect the user experience. The following shows the original design sketches that have evolved into an actual product. Along the way, we have made improvements and compromises. </p>

<h3>Foldable Prongs and International Converters</h3>
<p>With the design of foldable prongs and clip-on international converters, the SlimQ F100 is quite flexible to be used virtually anywhere in the world. Please note: we will give ONE free converter according to the country of shipping destination. For example, if ship to the UK, the F100 will have a UK converter with it. If ship to South Korea or Germany, it will come with a DE/KR converter. If you need all four converters, please choose them from the add-ons and add them to your order.</p>

<h3>Extension Cords</h3>
<p>There are situations where you will need an extension cable to reach a power outlet. For such cases, the specially designed extension cords will become handy. The cable has the clip-on plug to the F100 to make it look neat and maintain a small footprint.  </p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>My shipping address is not in the US/Japan/China. What converter do I get? Do I get all the converters?</strong>  </p>
<p>To avoid causing plastic waste, we do NOT send all four converters for each charger you buy. There are no converters for users in US/Japan/China etc. Otherwise, for each charger you order, we give one FREE converter according to the country of your shipping address. For example, for UK/Singapore/HongKong, we have a UK converter with it. For Korea/Germany, we have the KR/GE converter with it. If you are in EU countries, we will have the EU converter with it. If, for some reason, you do need a different converter, please order the converter package that has all four converters we have. The package is in the list of add-ons and costs $3. </p>
<p><strong>I have an old laptop that does not use Type C, how do I find the right cable for it?</strong></p>
<p>If your laptop is Lenovo, Apple, Surface, etc., it's easy to tell by its tip head. The difficulty may come in if your laptop is using a round plug tip. The reliable way to find the right cable is to find the dimension of the tip and find a matching one on our list. <u>Make sure you find the matching one for a particular brand as some laptop models share the same tip dimension even they are from different brands.</u> To find the dimension, as shown in the following pictures, you can either use a ruler to measure the current cable tip or research it online by using data on your current power adapter (normally on the back of the power adapter). If there is any doubt, please contact info@slimq.life with your computer model and a picture of the spec on your current adapter, so we can help you to find the right cable.</p>

Overview
SlimQ F100 is the by the far the world's smallest 100W GaN charger with a complete PFC function for true global use. Using next-generation GaNFast (gallium nitride) technology for small size and high power, it can charge up to 4 devices at the same time – from earbuds to phones, to tablets and the MacBook 16”. It is nicely designed and supports most of the fast-charging protocols for modern phones and laptops. 

 
Replace Multiple Chargers with One

 
World's Smallest 100W Charger with PFC Function
With a dimension of 70 x 68 x 29mm, the SlimQ F100 is smaller than two packs of Doublemint. It is by far the world's smallest 100W charger that has a complete PFC circuit (more about PFC later).
Compared to a series of Apple's chargers, the F100 stands out with more power and more fast-charging ports.
SlimQ F100 is easy to handle and carry around, thanks to its small size and carefully applied exterior material.  

 
Works with All Devices that Use Type-C Power Port

Works with Virtually All Laptop Models
If your laptop does not have a USB Type-C power port, don’t worry! We have prepared more than 20 types of converting cables that work with virtually all laptops on the market, including Macbook Pro, Microsoft Surface, Lenovo, Dell, HP, Acer, ASUS, etc. (A list of the cables is in ""specification"" section)

 
Fast Charging All Your Phones


Charge Your Macbook Pro
SlimQ F100 works well with Macbook Pro, including the Macbook Pro 15"" and 16"" that consumes max power of 87W and 96W, respectively.

 
Intelligent Power Distribution


 
Safety Features
 
GaN Technology
A new power semiconductor material - gallium nitride (GaN) - runs up to 20x faster than old, slow silicon (Si) chips, delivering up to 3x more power conversion and half the size and weight. GaNFast power ICs from Navitas Semiconductor enables the SlimQ F100 fast charger to reach world-class 94% efficiency, which means a cool operation in a small size. For more information on GaN, see www.GaNFast.com.
 
Complete PFC Circuit
SlimQ F100 includes a Power factor correction (PFC) circuit. The purpose of PFC is to improve the power factor which means power quality. Although the PFC circuit increases the charger size significantly, it increases energy efficiency, reduces electricity costs, and reduces the load on the electricity system. For adapters that have higher than 75W capacity, the PFC function is necessarily required by government regulations all over the world. With the PFC circuit, SlimQ F100 has a PF value of >0.95 compare to ~0.45 for chargers without PFC.
 

The presence of PFC also makes our charger more environment friendly compared to one without it. Assume the charger is used 10 hours a day and 300 days a year, compared to one without PFC, our charger can save 230KWHr electricity, which is equivalent to 227 pounds of carbon emission. It takes ten trees to offset that amount of carbon emission.
 
When Design Meets Engineering
We believe design is essential and even the center of a product. We designed the SlimQ F100 with multiple use case scenarios in mind. We paid attention to subtle details that might affect the user experience. The following shows the original design sketches that have evolved into an actual product. Along the way, we have made improvements and compromises. 



 
Foldable Prongs and International Converters
With the design of foldable prongs and clip-on international converters, the SlimQ F100 is quite flexible to be used virtually anywhere in the world. Please note: we will give ONE free converter according to the country of shipping destination. For example, if ship to the UK, the F100 will have a UK converter with it. If ship to South Korea or Germany, it will come with a DE/KR converter. If you need all four converters, please choose them from the add-ons and add them to your order.

 
Extension Cords
There are situations where you will need an extension cable to reach a power outlet. For such cases, the specially designed extension cords will become handy. The cable has the clip-on plug to the F100 to make it look neat and maintain a small footprint.  

 
Perks and Add-ons

 
 

Magnetic Cable
To show a little gratitude to our backers, we offer this Magnetic tip Type C to Type C cable at a significant discount. This cable is 5A/100W rated and is suitable for USB 2.0 data transmission. It comes in 5 colors and makes an excellent companion to the SlimQ F100 charger. Please note: it is only available as an add-on when you buy a perk.


 
How to Buy Perks and Add-ons
The product or product package you want to buy is called perks, and everything else is called add-ons. You need to choose the perk first and proceed to payment before you can see the add-ons.  Then on the same page, as you see the ""CHECKOUT"" button, you will see the add-ons available in ""Perks you may also like"" section.  You can browse all the available add-ons left and right; there might be many of them. Note: The following is a screenshot from PC, and it looks different on mobile phones but supports the same idea. Note: One add-on item can only be added once. Please feel free to contact us if there is any question.

 
Stretch Goal(s)
We will continue to receive ideas for stretch goals. The first stretch goal we picked is a USB Type-A to Type-C converter. The converter has a small footprint so you can literally leave it on the charger. It supports QC3.0 for fast charging and USB2.0 for data transmission. While we will all be using Type C in the future, we are still in a world of a mix of Type A and Type C. This little converter helps us to manage the transition into the future. 
We will include ONE converter for each F100 Charger that you receive when we reach the stretch goal! 

Product Specifications

SlimQ 65W comes with a FREE anti-tangle Silicone Type-C to Type-C cable and a FREE carry case.

 
Proof of Working Prototype
The most challenging work for this product is to fit all the components into a small case and have it working at >100W. The following video shows the out of box board working at >100W consistently. The left screen shows a PF value of 0.99, which is almost perfect. The right screen shows it works at ~108W.

 
 
FAQ
My shipping address is not in the US/Japan/China. What converter do I get? Do I get all the converters?  
To avoid causing plastic waste, we do NOT send all four converters for each charger you buy. There are no converters for users in US/Japan/China etc. Otherwise, for each charger you order, we give one FREE converter according to the country of your shipping address. For example, for UK/Singapore/HongKong, we have a UK converter with it. For Korea/Germany, we have the KR/GE converter with it. If you are in EU countries, we will have the EU converter with it. If, for some reason, you do need a different converter, please order the converter package that has all four converters we have. The package is in the list of add-ons and costs $3. 
I have an old laptop that does not use Type C, how do I find the right cable for it?
If your laptop is Lenovo, Apple, Surface, etc., it's easy to tell by its tip head. The difficulty may come in if your laptop is using a round plug tip. The reliable way to find the right cable is to find the dimension of the tip and find a matching one on our list. Make sure you find the matching one for a particular brand as some laptop models share the same tip dimension even they are from different brands. To find the dimension, as shown in the following pictures, you can either use a ruler to measure the current cable tip or research it online by using data on your current power adapter (normally on the back of the power adapter). If there is any doubt, please contact info@slimq.life with your computer model and a picture of the spec on your current adapter, so we can help you to find the right cable.

How can I buy multiple cables of the same type?
It is not easy to buy an add-on item multiple times on Indiegogo. Please contact us at info@slimq.life and let us know what the items and how many are. We need to make arrangements for that.
I use the F100 charger for multiple devices, how is the power distributed among the ports?
Please check the section ""Intelligent Power Distribution."" where you can find a table of all combinations of use cases. Please feel free to contact us if you have any suggestions or feedback on this.
I just bought an F100 yesterday, how to add a cable to my order?
If your order is not in ""locked"" or ""fulfillment"" status, it means your order is still not processed. The easiest is to cancel the older order and make a new one and add the cable in the add-on section to your new order before making payment. If your order is already processed, there is no way to change it, please contact us at info@slimq.life, and we will help you with that.
When will you ship the products?
We plan to start shipping orders within July. For other shipping related questions, please refer to the ""Shipping Policy"" section down below. 
Do you have any referral program?
Yes, absolutely. We offer 10% cash reward for any referral purchases. Please use this link to sign up. Then you will have your unique referral link. Just send your referral link to friends or colleagues, when they make a contribution to our project by using your link, you get a 10% reward. It is that simple!
Shipping Policy 

Although quite rare, international shipping may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE for those charges and procedures to clear custom for the shipped item. Again, it is your full responsibility to clear it by working with the shipping company or custom directly.
It is also the recipient's responsibility for charges such as change of address, parcel holding, return fees caused by the recipient. So please make sure you have the correct address information, including a phone number on file.
1) To which countries do you ship?
We ship globally, excluding those have been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any of these countries, we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more. However, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.
2) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?
Yes, and the amount will depend on your country’s regulations. However, usually the price is not that high, and people just get it directly.
3) What if my packet gets lost?
If the packet is not marked as ""delivered."", we can help to locate it and resend it when it gets lost. If the packet is marked as ""delivered"" in the mail system and you don't get it, it is your responsibility to contact the local post office or express company to get it resolved. For us to get involved, you need to get the post office to issue a letter stating the packet gets lost.

<h3>What is the WiPhone? </h3>
<p>WiPhone is a unique, minimal phone.</p>
<p>It's designed to enable hackers by making it easy to extend and modify the electronics and software. Something typical phones are not good for.</p>
<p>WiPhone is also a VoIP mobile phone. It uses WIFI to make HD voice calls, for free. This means that there is no required service contract - and it's yours for life.</p>
<h3>For Hackers:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/ReVYtho.gif"" src=""""/> </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>WiPhone: Business In The Front, Party In The Back</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Yet So Stylish And Sophisticated!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555434877/e8gzklfksbpv9bn9xeab.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>WiPhone: Perfect for both hardware hacking AND trips to the business factory.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555434897/fbz3e3fweftjzexhgiin.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> WiPhone Pro with Clear Front Face:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555434937/ssx5bauttuxx0vqxwryy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Smartphones Are A Little Too Smart</h3>
<p>What's the best platform you can imagine for electronics hacking?</p>
<p>It should probably be adaptable, powerful, and programmable. Small and portable would be nice. Maybe with a durable case? What about a built in user interface with things like an LCD screen and button panel? A battery and built-in charging system? Wireless connectivity?</p>
<p>Hey... we just described a mobile phone!</p>
<p>But why aren't people building more projects based on their smartphones? Well, there are a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>no electrical connectors to directly connect to the outside world</li>
<li>no way to easily control the low level hardware, like processor output pins</li>
<li>opaque development environment and huge IDE</li>
<li>not designed for easy disassembly, repair, or modification</li>
</ul>
<h3>Enter WiPhone: </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435026/itjzai5orcxjsxu1fp4d.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>WiPhone solves these problems and gives hackers, makers, and engineers the tool we all wish our phones could be. Nice package, direct access to I/O, an easy to program ESP32 processor. All the basics are already set up: user interface, power management and on/off circuit, working code.</p>
<p>You can get straight to work building your project, not setting up the boring parts like power management again and again. And once you're done it's durable and looks great. No ratsnest of wires or ugly stack of dev boards just to get the basic functionality.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435060/mrwndnvnbbnseiqfkesb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Modern smartphones are more and more a tool we don't own, but instead one we're only allowed to carry around. One that serves the interests of various tracking networks, corporate boards, and government organizations. You don't own it, it owns you. It tracks you, serves you ads, and sucks away your time with mindless dopamine hits. <strong>We want a phone that's back in our control, optimized for our convenience.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435110/dpq7qtcezb0j9h9f8o9a.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Free Calling! No Hacking Required!</strong></p>
<p>WiPhone is different beast from most smartphones these days. WiPhone uses the existing WiFi around you to make HD Voice calls. For free. Buy it once and it's yours.</p>
<p>Works on most broadband WiFi networks (including most home WiFi connections). No service contract required, and you can even upgrade the firmware or expand the hardware to do things it wasn't originally intended for. </p>
<h3>What Is This Magical Free Calling You Speak of? Tell me more...</h3>
<p>Free calling starts with a SIP account. SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol, and it's a standard way to make call over the internet. VoIP is a related term that you may have heard of. There are commercial services that provide SIP/VoIP accounts, and some of them have free accounts. Most consumers use VoIP apps like Skype and Whatsapp, but we can still use the underlying technology directly. After the campaign we'll spend more time testing services to make our software and instructions work as seamlessly as possible.</p>
<p>Step 1: Get a SIP account (many different ways to do this, but we wrote up a simple <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uPa_2V09S3YnJV_ouEUT19nDvY82nd5PcWwRDm2ayhY/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">how-to</a> that might get you started).</p>
<p>Step 2: Log in on your WiPhone using the credentials from your SIP account (user name, password, and server): <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/85qsnuO.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Step 3: Make a Call:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/QpNLHXm.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That's it!</p>
<p><i>Note: we're still working through compatibility with various SIP providers since many of them implement the standard in various ways. Once the WiPhones ship we'll update our getting started instructions to use the servers we find to be most reliable.</i></p>
<h3>What people are saying about WiPhone:</h3>
<p>“This is a great cross over between what people know (phones) and what people really want to do (hack)."" -Nathan Seidle, Sparkfun Founder</p>
<p>“The WiPhone is a really rather neatly put together project.” -Alasdair Allan, Hackster.io</p>
<p>“If you want a phone that respects your right to repair, this is the project to look at.” -Brian Benchoff, Hackaday.com</p>
<p>“So excited by this project I tried to make one myself” -Random Guy On Our YouTube Channel</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435365/z33zwxxqoh2qvng4kdrn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>First Class Expansion Capabilities</h3>

<p>WiPhone is expandable through daughter boards. The whole back of the phone is a replaceable panel that accepts a standard 1.6mm thickness PCB, which you can use to add whatever functionality you like.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/TXpm8EW.gif"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/L8C8JQv.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Daughterboard PCB Design, Keepout Areas</i></p>
<p><strong>Some Examples</strong></p>
<p>We made a WiPhone into an RC car:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/VzIsXwo.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And we also made the coolest way to ever to answer a phone:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/jd60dhs.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The daughterboard headers have power, digital I/O, and all the common embedded busses like SPI, I2C, and UART.</p>
<h3>Easy Development </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435461/mmlek40ymnsfrmygaeh6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Develop in Arduino/C++ or Python. We'll also provide basic tutorials covering how to write to the screen, connect to the hardware, save data to memory, etc.  We'll let you give us feedback on what's most important to you.</p>
<h3>No-Mess Prototyping </h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435498/ccdp4bhw1e7nxtsbjlh7.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<p>Daughterboards are what make the WiPhone so unique. Pre-made designs allow you to swap in functionality as you need it, or you can make your own to easily and quickly prototype new ideas or customize your phone to do the things you need.</p>
<h3>LoRa </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555435993/vquzd4b0s0garwwt5vcw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>LoRa is a radio technology that enables sending short packets of data over a long range (generally kilometers). The LoRa daughter board is designed around the HopeRF RFM95W LoRa-enabled radio module. An onboard 915 MHz PCB antenna makes the board handy and easy to carry anywhere. For users who want more range, add an external antenna using the U.fl connector.</p>

<h3>Build Status and Prototypes</h3>
<p>We've made a lot of progress already. VoIP calling works and we've gone through over 5 generations of prototypes. The current phone prototypes look and feel almost like production units.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555436474/czrshuozfcdpncnhylix.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>WiPhone Prototyping Progression</i></p>
<p><strong>Mechanical:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The units we have now are durable and look good. Can be carried around in public without any bomb searches :).</li>
<li>Still need to do some reliability testing to make sure we have the right material for the front screen cover (needs to be scratch resistant), plating for the frame, etc.</li>
<li>Need to go through and set manufacturing tolerances for everything</li>
<li>Choose the final keypad material.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Electrical:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Most major bugs have been dealt with... the power system works and doesn't use excessive power when it shouldn't, the mic and speaker do what they need to without a lot of noise, and the connection to the daughterboards has been used with a variety of daughterboards.</li>
<li>Need to do more extensive power testing since this is a common area that devices can have problems with.</li>
<li>Need to build an automated programmer and tester.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Software:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We can make and receive calls.</li>
<li>Some SIP providers implement different methods for session initiation, calling, etc, and we are currently testing various accounts and working through bugs and adding abilities to use more providers.</li>
<li>Python apps and OTA firmware updates are yet to be implemented.</li>

<p>WiPhone is a hardware project, which means many, many things have to happen correctly before it's finished. In general, you can expect any new hardware project to have delays.</p>
<p>That said, we design, manufacture, and ship products all the time, so we are confident we can solve any problems that come up.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","What is the WiPhone? 
WiPhone is a unique, minimal phone.
It's designed to enable hackers by making it easy to extend and modify the electronics and software. Something typical phones are not good for.
WiPhone is also a VoIP mobile phone. It uses WIFI to make HD voice calls, for free. This means that there is no required service contract - and it's yours for life.
For Hackers: 
WiPhone: Business In The Front, Party In The Back
 
Yet So Stylish And Sophisticated!
 

WiPhone: Perfect for both hardware hacking AND trips to the business factory.

 WiPhone Pro with Clear Front Face:

Smartphones Are A Little Too Smart
What's the best platform you can imagine for electronics hacking?
It should probably be adaptable, powerful, and programmable. Small and portable would be nice. Maybe with a durable case? What about a built in user interface with things like an LCD screen and button panel? A battery and built-in charging system? Wireless connectivity?
Hey... we just described a mobile phone!
But why aren't people building more projects based on their smartphones? Well, there are a few issues:

no electrical connectors to directly connect to the outside world
no way to easily control the low level hardware, like processor output pins
opaque development environment and huge IDE
not designed for easy disassembly, repair, or modification

Enter WiPhone: 

WiPhone solves these problems and gives hackers, makers, and engineers the tool we all wish our phones could be. Nice package, direct access to I/O, an easy to program ESP32 processor. All the basics are already set up: user interface, power management and on/off circuit, working code.
You can get straight to work building your project, not setting up the boring parts like power management again and again. And once you're done it's durable and looks great. No ratsnest of wires or ugly stack of dev boards just to get the basic functionality.  

Modern smartphones are more and more a tool we don't own, but instead one we're only allowed to carry around. One that serves the interests of various tracking networks, corporate boards, and government organizations. You don't own it, it owns you. It tracks you, serves you ads, and sucks away your time with mindless dopamine hits. We want a phone that's back in our control, optimized for our convenience.

Free Calling! No Hacking Required!
WiPhone is different beast from most smartphones these days. WiPhone uses the existing WiFi around you to make HD Voice calls. For free. Buy it once and it's yours.
Works on most broadband WiFi networks (including most home WiFi connections). No service contract required, and you can even upgrade the firmware or expand the hardware to do things it wasn't originally intended for. 
What Is This Magical Free Calling You Speak of? Tell me more...
Free calling starts with a SIP account. SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol, and it's a standard way to make call over the internet. VoIP is a related term that you may have heard of. There are commercial services that provide SIP/VoIP accounts, and some of them have free accounts. Most consumers use VoIP apps like Skype and Whatsapp, but we can still use the underlying technology directly. After the campaign we'll spend more time testing services to make our software and instructions work as seamlessly as possible.
Step 1: Get a SIP account (many different ways to do this, but we wrote up a simple how-to that might get you started).
Step 2: Log in on your WiPhone using the credentials from your SIP account (user name, password, and server): 
 
Step 3: Make a Call:
That's it!
Note: we're still working through compatibility with various SIP providers since many of them implement the standard in various ways. Once the WiPhones ship we'll update our getting started instructions to use the servers we find to be most reliable.
What people are saying about WiPhone:
“This is a great cross over between what people know (phones) and what people really want to do (hack)."" -Nathan Seidle, Sparkfun Founder
“The WiPhone is a really rather neatly put together project.” -Alasdair Allan, Hackster.io
“If you want a phone that respects your right to repair, this is the project to look at.” -Brian Benchoff, Hackaday.com
“So excited by this project I tried to make one myself” -Random Guy On Our YouTube Channel

First Class Expansion Capabilities

WiPhone is expandable through daughter boards. The whole back of the phone is a replaceable panel that accepts a standard 1.6mm thickness PCB, which you can use to add whatever functionality you like.
  
Daughterboard PCB Design, Keepout Areas
Some Examples
We made a WiPhone into an RC car:

And we also made the coolest way to ever to answer a phone:

The daughterboard headers have power, digital I/O, and all the common embedded busses like SPI, I2C, and UART.
Easy Development 

Develop in Arduino/C++ or Python. We'll also provide basic tutorials covering how to write to the screen, connect to the hardware, save data to memory, etc.  We'll let you give us feedback on what's most important to you.
No-Mess Prototyping 

Build Your Prototype Right On The Back Of The Phone
 

Daughterboards are what make the WiPhone so unique. Pre-made designs allow you to swap in functionality as you need it, or you can make your own to easily and quickly prototype new ideas or customize your phone to do the things you need.
LoRa 

LoRa is a radio technology that enables sending short packets of data over a long range (generally kilometers). The LoRa daughter board is designed around the HopeRF RFM95W LoRa-enabled radio module. An onboard 915 MHz PCB antenna makes the board handy and easy to carry anywhere. For users who want more range, add an external antenna using the U.fl connector.

Build Status and Prototypes
We've made a lot of progress already. VoIP calling works and we've gone through over 5 generations of prototypes. The current phone prototypes look and feel almost like production units.

WiPhone Prototyping Progression
Mechanical:

The units we have now are durable and look good. Can be carried around in public without any bomb searches :).
Still need to do some reliability testing to make sure we have the right material for the front screen cover (needs to be scratch resistant), plating for the frame, etc.
Need to go through and set manufacturing tolerances for everything
Choose the final keypad material.

Electrical:

Most major bugs have been dealt with... the power system works and doesn't use excessive power when it shouldn't, the mic and speaker do what they need to without a lot of noise, and the connection to the daughterboards has been used with a variety of daughterboards.
Need to do more extensive power testing since this is a common area that devices can have problems with.
Need to build an automated programmer and tester.

Software:

We can make and receive calls.
Some SIP providers implement different methods for session initiation, calling, etc, and we are currently testing various accounts and working through bugs and adding abilities to use more providers.
Python apps and OTA firmware updates are yet to be implemented.

The exterior is a slate-blue robust material with a layer of neoprene to provide a tactile feel that can be easily kept clean and survive scuffs in your bag.

<br/><strong>Designed and Made in the U.S.</strong>
</h3><p>Designed in Austin, Texas, and made in California. We realized that getting this made overseas could jeopardize the timeline, particularly with Covid complications causing some factories and suppliers with delays. We also wanted to avoid long shipping times, and keep full control over the end product, so making it locally was an important factor. While the clips are being manufactured in China, the rest of the product is being manufactured and assembled in California, and shipped from our warehouse in Austin, TX for U.S. orders. International orders will be shipped to overseas fulfillment warehouses for distribution to your door. While this method added slightly to the cost of manufacturing, we felt that quality, control and timeliness delivering orders were of paramount importance. </p><h3>

While attempting to work on a Brooklyn roof deck in peak summer, it became glaringly obvious that laptops, tablets and their screens do not work well in direct sunlight. The glare from the sun diminishes your view of the screen, while overheating your device and preventing it from working in a matter of minutes!</p><p>The existing options were to (a) put your device in a cardboard box, (b) sit entirely in the shade or (c) use one of the clunky, poorly designed existing sun shades which were not only expensive, but which typically used elastic to attach to your screen. The elastic would cover over your apps and was incredibly tricky to attach, and then wouldn't stay connected if it was windy. It become clear that nobody had solved the problem sufficiently.</p><p>Then, in March 2020, the Covid-19 crisis caused a huge shift in people moving from offices to working from home. It was clear that this was the time to develop the concept, evolve the design and get it production ready for a new way of working, so <strong>SunShader</strong>™ <strong>was born as the ultimate sun shade, heat shade and privacy shade</strong> for your laptop or tablet.</p><p><strong>SunShader</strong>™ is successfully patented in the U.S. and Patent Pending in over 30 countries worldwide.</p><p><strong>Follow us on Instagram @<a href=""http://instagram.com/sunshader.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sunshader.us</a></strong></p><h3>

</h3><p>We shall be shipping orders in the order they are received. The sooner you purchase, the sooner we shall ship your order. We are anticipating our first batch of orders to be shipped out to you in  May, just in time for summer. While 95% of the item is made in the U.S. we are currently using our partner in China to produce the clips. We will be shipping the clips by air to our facility in California for assembly with the rest of the product. However we have already begun the process of ordering those clips and are hopeful that this enables us to speed up the timeline for production.</p><p>We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan. Obviously, sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. Component delays and unexpected shortages can, on rare occasions, occur. Should we miss projections, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.</p><h3>
<br/><strong>Environmental Commitments</strong>
</h3><p>♻️ SunShader™ uses recycled heavyweight chipboard (a form of cardboard) to provide the internal rigidity. This forms the bulk of the item and we have specifically chosen this material rather than plastic to ensure <strong>SunShader™ is as environmentally friendly as possible</strong>.</p><p>SunShader™ is manufactured using high quality materials, durable clips, and a manufacturing method that fuses each layer of fabric together at a molecular level making it 100% water-tight, heat proof and ensuring it will last for years to come, while sustaining knocks and scuffs in your bag.</p><h3><strong>Sharing is Caring</strong></h3><p>Help us by telling your friends and family about SunShader!</p><p>Know someone who would be just as thrilled as you are about SunShader?

Medium fits most 12-14"" screens
Large fits most 15-16"" screens
For other sizes please email hello@sunshader.com
Note:  screen size is measured diagonally, though it is best to refer to your laptop model specification to obtain your actual screen size.Problem: Sun vs ScreenWorking remotely is the new normal. Today, we face a new requirement: how do we work effectively beyond the office? Be it on planes, trains, in cafes or just inside somewhere by a bright window. Until now, seeing your screen in sunlight was impossible, and your device would overheat within minutes. So we created SunShader™ to make ""working from anywhere"" effortless. Solution: A Bright IdeaWith SunShader™ you, or your team, can now Work From Anywhere!
Turn your balcony or a roof deck into your office
Check off tasks at the pool or at the park
Work on projects privately while in public spaces, from airports and planes to cafes and trains.
Even take your business to the beach!

Features
Meet the Founding Team
Patented Innovation
SunShader™ has fully granted patents in the U.S. and is Patent Pending in over 30 countries worldwide. With our specially designed flexible, rubberized clips, SunShader™ snaps securely onto the edges of your screen, and quick-releases with a simple tug. The clip design flexes open and closed to fit different screen thicknesses, from slim Macbooks through to chunkier laptops screens and tablets. And importantly, unlike the alternatives which use clunky elastic, the clips sit at the very edge of your screen without obscuring any of your screen space, your apps or camera!
SunShader is Portable
SunShader™ is portable, folding up to fit neatly into your bag alongside your device! ✨ Premium MaterialsSunShader™ uses a jet black, plush material on the interior, which protects your device, while forming a black-out zone to see your screen perfectly. The exterior is a slate-blue robust material with a layer of neoprene to provide a tactile feel that can be easily kept clean and survive scuffs in your bag. The clips are made of a flexible, but robust material. Together, these materials ensure that SunShader™ will be a quality long-lasting purchase.
Designed and Made in the U.S.
Designed in Austin, Texas, and made in California. We realized that getting this made overseas could jeopardize the timeline, particularly with Covid complications causing some factories and suppliers with delays. We also wanted to avoid long shipping times, and keep full control over the end product, so making it locally was an important factor. While the clips are being manufactured in China, the rest of the product is being manufactured and assembled in California, and shipped from our warehouse in Austin, TX for U.S. orders. International orders will be shipped to overseas fulfillment warehouses for distribution to your door. While this method added slightly to the cost of manufacturing, we felt that quality, control and timeliness delivering orders were of paramount importance. 
How it Began, and Evolved.
Inventor Alex Griffin had a bright idea when he realized how badly his laptop reacted to the effects of the sun. While attempting to work on a Brooklyn roof deck in peak summer, it became glaringly obvious that laptops, tablets and their screens do not work well in direct sunlight. The glare from the sun diminishes your view of the screen, while overheating your device and preventing it from working in a matter of minutes!The existing options were to (a) put your device in a cardboard box, (b) sit entirely in the shade or (c) use one of the clunky, poorly designed existing sun shades which were not only expensive, but which typically used elastic to attach to your screen. The elastic would cover over your apps and was incredibly tricky to attach, and then wouldn't stay connected if it was windy. It become clear that nobody had solved the problem sufficiently.Then, in March 2020, the Covid-19 crisis caused a huge shift in people moving from offices to working from home. It was clear that this was the time to develop the concept, evolve the design and get it production ready for a new way of working, so SunShader™ was born as the ultimate sun shade, heat shade and privacy shade for your laptop or tablet.SunShader™ is successfully patented in the U.S. and Patent Pending in over 30 countries worldwide.Follow us on Instagram @sunshader.us
Risks & Challenges
We shall be shipping orders in the order they are received. The sooner you purchase, the sooner we shall ship your order. We are anticipating our first batch of orders to be shipped out to you in  May, just in time for summer. While 95% of the item is made in the U.S. we are currently using our partner in China to produce the clips. We will be shipping the clips by air to our facility in California for assembly with the rest of the product. However we have already begun the process of ordering those clips and are hopeful that this enables us to speed up the timeline for production.We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan. Obviously, sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. Component delays and unexpected shortages can, on rare occasions, occur. Should we miss projections, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possible.
Environmental Commitments
♻️ SunShader™ uses recycled heavyweight chipboard (a form of cardboard) to provide the internal rigidity. This forms the bulk of the item and we have specifically chosen this material rather than plastic to ensure SunShader™ is as environmentally friendly as possible.SunShader™ is manufactured using high quality materials, durable clips, and a manufacturing method that fuses each layer of fabric together at a molecular level making it 100% water-tight, heat proof and ensuring it will last for years to come, while sustaining knocks and scuffs in your bag.Sharing is CaringHelp us by telling your friends and family about SunShader!Know someone who would be just as thrilled as you are about SunShader?

Just going out for a business meeting in a foreign country will mean carrying your laptop charger, phone charger and travel adapter. Imagine being able to bring just 1 charger to charge your Macbook, iPad and iPhone almost ANYWHERE in the world. G6 features an USB-C 61W Power Delivery 3.0 port (PPS), 2 USB A ports, power adapter, universal travel adapter and auto-resetting fuse all packed into a pocket-sized adapter. Finally an all-in-one adapter that can replace the hassle of worrying about bringing all your other chargers around the world.   Travelling should be seamless and easy but in order to stay connected in today's world it's a hassle to pack chargers for your USB devices including your laptop, phone, travel adapters and still manage to fit in your other belongings. Smaller travel adapters can only support 2 or 3 devices at a time and at low charge speeds. G6 has a USB-C (PPS) port, 2 USB-A ports, and a 4 pin multi-region AC output, charging up to 4 devices simultaneously.With the high-power requirements of today's devices, anything less than 30W is barely going to charge your devices. Our innovative 61W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 (PPS) output sets a new standard for travel adapters allowing you to charge high-powered devices at the full USB-C speed including 13"" Macbook Pro and Macbook Air.   USB-C is the new standard for powering and charging all USB-C devices including phones, tablets and laptops with Power Delivery 3.0 being the latest innovation. G6 features a 61W USB-C Power Deliver 3.0 (PPS) port meaning G6 has no limits with compatibility, allowing fast charging for your USB-C devices, including phones, laptops, tablets, speakers, cameras, headphones, Nintendo Switches and even drones.Keep your iPhone battery charged up with 18W maximum charge speed support from G6 going from 0% - 50% in only 30 minutes. Our USB-C port also support Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 & 3.0 enabled devices. Convenient for Android users who are use to the fast charging speeds offered by QC 2.0/3.0. G6 is designed with compatibility in mind so we have upgraded all our G6 units to support 61W PD 3.0 programmable power supply (PPS) from the main USB-C port. In 2017, the USB-IF Association added Programmable Power Supply (PPS) to the USB PD 3.0 standard, hoping to unify specification for today's fast charging solutions.   The PPS standard refers to the power supply can exchange data with the power supply every ten seconds, so that the power supply can dynamically adjust the output voltage and current according to the condition of the receiving product specifications. The voltage range is between 3~21V, with 20mV increments. This means G6 can charge all USB-C laptops that follow the PD2.0 or PD3.0 standard including brands such as Dell, HP, Asus, Lenovo, Acer, Sony and more. In 2017, Qualcomm’s QC4.0 complied with PPS standards, reaching a unified charging scheme. PPS support also means that QC4.0 devices will be charge at full speed so you can get going faster.  G6 is the first travel adapter in the world that supports 13"" Macbook's 61W charging protocol requirements. Competitors at most can only support 30W with many brands claiming 30 - 45W total but only 18W from the USB-C port which is barely enough to power the Macbook. Most generic travel adapters on the market only support 6A which equates to 600W @ 100V or 1500W @ 250V depending where in the world you're using the adapter. This means common high wattage devices such as irons, hair dryers, microwaves, mini-ovens, toasters, heaters and air conditioners won't be supported. G6 solves this problem with a superior 8A fuse which equates to 800W @ 100V or 2,000W @ 250V supporting a larger range of high-wattage devices. It is not recommended to plug a grounding plug into a non-grounding travel adapter like G6.Supports Charging the Flash PowerbankGreat news for existing Flash user: G6 is compatible with our Flash graphene 20,000mAh powerbanks charging at 61W meaning you can go from 0 - 100% within 100 minutes. Travel hassle free with just 1 adapter for all your devices in 200+ countries.  One of the most annoying things that happen when travelling is when you blow a fuse forcing you to go out and find a new fuse, which can be difficult in new cities, especially if it happens during off-work hours when shops are closed. G6 features an innovative auto-resetting fuse that disconnects the power when there is a current overload and re-connects back a minute later. This means your devices will stay protected from any surges time and time again. The auto-resetting fuse is tested to withstand 15,000 resets so you can be assured that it will outlast your lifetime of use.  It can be very frustrating needing different adapters for different countries with many cheaper adapters coming in multiple pieces that you have to keep connecting and disconnecting. These pieces often get lost or are very flimsy and break easily. We've designed a travel adapter that is convenient and easy to use with a simple 1-hand easy press of the side button that you slide out for the pin of your choice.G6 conveniently works in over 200 countries supporting all the major types of wall plugs used worldwide. Here's a chart showing the major plug types that G6 is compatible with including: A, B, C, E, F G I, J, K, L & N.  Chargeasap is able to deliver 61W of power through incorporating a Pi Innovo GaN internal circuit (IC) which allows a USB-C PD 3.0 (PPS) port in a compact size. Gallium Nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor material that replaces traditional silicon-based power adapters allowing higher efficiency, less heat and the ability to handle a higher current.  GaN IC’s are over 10 times smaller than traditional IC’s a major advancement in the electronics field.Each G6 travel adapter contains a Pi Innovo SC1933C chip. Pi Innovo is 1 of the 3 largest GaN IC manufacturers worldwide. Providing a high powered 61W USB-C output inside a small form factor is a challenging feat to overcome. We've ensured not to compromise on functionality or design to create an aesthetically pleasing device that you would be proud to carry around and show off. In creating the world's first 61W travel adapter to ensure your high powered laptops can charge quickly, we limited the final design to 2 USB A ports that output 5V/2.4A.   Designed with convenience in mind, a small blue LED indicator will turn on to indicate the power is connected so you can find the ports even in the dark.   $6 Flat Shipping Fee Worldwide On All Orders In order to achieve international certification for safe use, each G6 unit is put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure G6 can withstand daily use- even the most extreme of circumstances. Giving you comfort and peace of mind regardless of where you travel.    G6 is protected with a 3 year hassle-free international warranty.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've spent the last 4 years redesigning the USB cable to finally create one powerful enough to work with all USB devices supporting micro USB, Apple, USB-C as well as the biggest device in your arsenal, USB-C laptops. Not only can the Infinity Cable support QC 3.0 &amp; 4.0, but for the first time ever, it can support Power Delivery charging up to 100W. No kidding, we really have been working on this for 4 years, you can see all the previous iterations down below in the story section. We're really stoked to finally bring this vision to life with your help!</p>
<div data-id=""26222706""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592384/lvajyjn7g7amf79ywz4u.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Connecting to your phone during difficult situations without pausing what you're doing has never been easier, such as driving on-the-go.  </p>
<div data-id=""26586826""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/3Gps2LL.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Busy getting things done? Connect hassle free with just one hand. Our cables feature a reversible magnetic connection which means instant connection every single time. No more fumbling around to connect your devices, even in the dark.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Have you ever left your phone to charge overnight but wake up to find the battery dead? We've listened to customer feedback and brought back our original LED light function for the Infinity Cable which only turns on when your device has been connected and is successfully charging. The UNO cable LED light would always be on when connected to a power source, regardless if the device was successfully connected. This indicator will eliminate incidents where you've left your device to charge but it hasn't even been connected properly. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Please note: When you plug the Infinity cable into the Type A adapter and into a Type A power source, the light will turn on already before connecting to the device due to USB cable configurations,. Without the adapter the light will only turn on once the device is connected to the power source and the device.   </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each Infinity cable set features 2x N54 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. We really mean it when we say we're using the world's strongest magnets. They're even strong enough to hold an iPad Air which is 437g (0.96lb)! These are the same magnets that have been sold to over 100,000 customers since 2016 so the unparalleled quality and durability of them sets us apart from other brands. </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Since the inception of our UNO cable, we have upgraded the magnetic strength of our new cables which includes Infinity cable. This is through incorporating an innovative locking mechanism, giving your cable a stronger connection and longer lifespan. This stronger magnetic strength means it can support a longer cable. Each cable set comes with a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable with an optional 2m (6.5ft) and 40cm (1.3ft) cable sold separately. We've also improved the connectivity lifespan of the older cables from 30,000 to 40,000 connections. Means a longer lasting cable that will outlast all your devices.    </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">With the invention of USB, you’ve been forced to carry at least 3 different cables for all your devices. But with that comes, tangled cables, compatibility issues and just a whole heap of mess our fast paced lives just don't have time for. USB Stands for Universal Serial Bus. So we thought, why not make a USB cable the way it should be- truly universal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We're serious when we say 1 cable for your phones, tablets and USB devices. Our 3 connectors (Lightning, Micro USB &amp; USB-C) are designed to be compatible with all your modern devices from headphones to Nintendo Switch, E-Cigs, GoPro the list is endless. What sets Infinity on a league on it's own is that is also works with USB-C laptops, and we mean ALL laptops including Macbook Air and Macbook Pro. </p>
<div data-id=""26652618""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592390/l8ewobbgc1yyt8ilqkpd.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Infinity Cable is capable of 2-way full speed USB 2.0 data transfer at 480 Mbps between any USB devices. It's also capable of 100W PD charge, something very few magnetic cables can achieve and certainly the first in the world that's also compatible with lightning and micro USB tips. You can see below that the Infinity cable is matching the same max charge speed of the original Apple cable. </p>
<div data-id=""26774763""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592391/jczupshpkale4gvqly2r.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each cable comes with a complimentary cord wrap, convenient for adjusting the length of the cable or quickly wrapping the cable away for neat and tidy storage or transportation. Say goodbye to messy and tangled cables forever.    </p>
<div data-id=""26652690""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592391/zx2nu7xtevj2572ecw7e.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've also reduced the brightness of the LED light at the request of previous backers. This is done through 2 changes, firstly an ideal hole size of 0.8mm and secondly a darker plastic material to dim the light. This means you can still easily find your cable in the dark with minimal ambient light keeping you up at night.    </p>
<div data-id=""26652748""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592392/tt4ydsge5oos6l6oepmd.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Regular cables don't even last a few years (and if you're an iPhone owner you'll know it doesn't even last 6 months!) Infinity cables replace all your USB charging cables and are backed with a 15 year warranty saving you a ton of money.  For the first time we're increasing the warranty period for our Infinity Cable from the standard 1 year you find with most cable brands to our premium 15 year warranty. With our improved materials and machinery process, we believe we've designed a cable to last longer than the next 15 years! This is an international warranty that we will honor on any Infinity cables sold worldwide. </p>
<div data-id=""26586840""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592393/pe3pdjjq2k4abirc7vjr.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Infinity Cable is made out of 9T which is a more temperature resistant material compared to the LCP plastic which is found on most other cables including our older asap Connect and asap X-Connect cable ranges. The end result is a cooler to touch cable, particularly during use with QC3.0, QC4.0 and PD charging. This means the cables are less likely to be worn out by heat over time. </p>
<div data-id=""26652841""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592394/c8qdxrj7wbqhpisy1xju.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Infinity cable is made from quality material including military grade tangle free nylon. Thicker cables allow for extra currents, which means a faster charge. That's why we've improved the wire thickness from 22AWG (for UNO) to 18AWG for Infinity which means increasing the diameter of the cable from 3.3mm to 4mm to be able to support functionality of QC3.0 , QC4.0 as well as Power Delivery up to 100W.    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Infinity cables will also incorporate 4x 3000D nylon braids to reinforce the strength of the cable. We've put the Infinity Cables through a bend test machine, being the cable at least 15,000 times, 180 degrees to ensure it can last through all your rigorous daily usage.  </p>
<div data-id=""26652901""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592395/y9de8hqnwbglwqyvruqg.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Infinity Cable features an anti-fray neck, meaning your cables have increased durability and less chance of fraying or snapping at the most common weak point. This anti-fray neck design significantly increases the lifespan of the cable handling everyday wear and tear.  Since UNO, we've increased the anti-fray neck to a slightly larger and more durable size without compromising the magnetic strength.</p>
<div data-id=""26653073""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1573592395/aadhejhxtrrgjhacflub.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Each Infinity cable set comes with a bonus tip removal tool in a new sleek black colour which allow you to remove the tip from all your devices with ease. Please note that this tool isn't required as the tip can be easily removed with your fingers, though some people prefer using it for phones with cases or devices with depressed USB holes such as a GoPro. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">An often overlooked feature of magnetic cables is that it will protect your phone port from dust and dirt entering. By leaving the tip in there, it will also extend the life of your phone port from the normal wear and tear of cables being inserted and pulled out on a daily basis.   </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">As phones begin to become more advanced and are an essential to daily life, one of the most important features we consider is how long it will take for your phone to charge up. We're always on the move, so who has the time to stand around waiting for their device to charge up?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Power delivery (PD) phones such as the Pixel 4, S10+ 5G or the Note 11+ which can charge up to 45W is more than 3x faster than non-PD phones. This is much faster than wireless charging which is limited to only 5-15W max currently. E.g. the iPhone X only wireless charges at 7.5W, which is 6x slower than the Note 11+. Wireless charge speeds have a long way to catch-up to PD, something we just don't have time for today in our busy lives. All future phones will incorporate PD technology. So if you want to utilize the fast charging feature of your phone, this can only be achieved through charging with a cable that is PD compatible.</p>

</div></div>","Watch the video to check out the 9to5mac hands-on review of the Infinity Cable.
This is the Chargeasap Infinity Cable. The world's first cable to support 100W USB-C PD and be cross-device compatible with all 3 major USB types making it the world's first truly universal USB cable compatible with all phones, tablets and USB-C PD devices including laptops. 

Tripping over and breaking your laptop is a thing of the past, with our Mag-safe connector bringing back the snag-free feature giving you peace of mind.

 

Start your day with ease and peace of mind with our Yank-Safe connection.

We've spent the last 4 years redesigning the USB cable to finally create one powerful enough to work with all USB devices supporting micro USB, Apple, USB-C as well as the biggest device in your arsenal, USB-C laptops. Not only can the Infinity Cable support QC 3.0 & 4.0, but for the first time ever, it can support Power Delivery charging up to 100W. No kidding, we really have been working on this for 4 years, you can see all the previous iterations down below in the story section. We're really stoked to finally bring this vision to life with your help!


Connecting to your phone during difficult situations without pausing what you're doing has never been easier, such as driving on-the-go.  

Busy getting things done? Connect hassle free with just one hand. Our cables feature a reversible magnetic connection which means instant connection every single time. No more fumbling around to connect your devices, even in the dark.  
Have you ever left your phone to charge overnight but wake up to find the battery dead? We've listened to customer feedback and brought back our original LED light function for the Infinity Cable which only turns on when your device has been connected and is successfully charging. The UNO cable LED light would always be on when connected to a power source, regardless if the device was successfully connected. This indicator will eliminate incidents where you've left your device to charge but it hasn't even been connected properly. 
Please note: When you plug the Infinity cable into the Type A adapter and into a Type A power source, the light will turn on already before connecting to the device due to USB cable configurations,. Without the adapter the light will only turn on once the device is connected to the power source and the device.   


Each Infinity cable set features 2x N54 grade neodymium magnets which are the world's strongest commercial grade magnets. We really mean it when we say we're using the world's strongest magnets. They're even strong enough to hold an iPad Air which is 437g (0.96lb)! These are the same magnets that have been sold to over 100,000 customers since 2016 so the unparalleled quality and durability of them sets us apart from other brands. 

Since the inception of our UNO cable, we have upgraded the magnetic strength of our new cables which includes Infinity cable. This is through incorporating an innovative locking mechanism, giving your cable a stronger connection and longer lifespan. This stronger magnetic strength means it can support a longer cable. Each cable set comes with a 1.2m (3.9ft) cable with an optional 2m (6.5ft) and 40cm (1.3ft) cable sold separately. We've also improved the connectivity lifespan of the older cables from 30,000 to 40,000 connections. Means a longer lasting cable that will outlast all your devices.    


With the invention of USB, you’ve been forced to carry at least 3 different cables for all your devices. But with that comes, tangled cables, compatibility issues and just a whole heap of mess our fast paced lives just don't have time for. USB Stands for Universal Serial Bus. So we thought, why not make a USB cable the way it should be- truly universal.
We're serious when we say 1 cable for your phones, tablets and USB devices. Our 3 connectors (Lightning, Micro USB & USB-C) are designed to be compatible with all your modern devices from headphones to Nintendo Switch, E-Cigs, GoPro the list is endless. What sets Infinity on a league on it's own is that is also works with USB-C laptops, and we mean ALL laptops including Macbook Air and Macbook Pro. 

The Infinity Cable is capable of 2-way full speed USB 2.0 data transfer at 480 Mbps between any USB devices. It's also capable of 100W PD charge, something very few magnetic cables can achieve and certainly the first in the world that's also compatible with lightning and micro USB tips. You can see below that the Infinity cable is matching the same max charge speed of the original Apple cable. 

Each cable comes with a complimentary cord wrap, convenient for adjusting the length of the cable or quickly wrapping the cable away for neat and tidy storage or transportation. Say goodbye to messy and tangled cables forever.    

We've also reduced the brightness of the LED light at the request of previous backers. This is done through 2 changes, firstly an ideal hole size of 0.8mm and secondly a darker plastic material to dim the light. This means you can still easily find your cable in the dark with minimal ambient light keeping you up at night.    

Regular cables don't even last a few years (and if you're an iPhone owner you'll know it doesn't even last 6 months!) Infinity cables replace all your USB charging cables and are backed with a 15 year warranty saving you a ton of money.  For the first time we're increasing the warranty period for our Infinity Cable from the standard 1 year you find with most cable brands to our premium 15 year warranty. With our improved materials and machinery process, we believe we've designed a cable to last longer than the next 15 years! This is an international warranty that we will honor on any Infinity cables sold worldwide. 

The Infinity Cable is made out of 9T which is a more temperature resistant material compared to the LCP plastic which is found on most other cables including our older asap Connect and asap X-Connect cable ranges. The end result is a cooler to touch cable, particularly during use with QC3.0, QC4.0 and PD charging. This means the cables are less likely to be worn out by heat over time. 

The Infinity cable is made from quality material including military grade tangle free nylon. Thicker cables allow for extra currents, which means a faster charge. That's why we've improved the wire thickness from 22AWG (for UNO) to 18AWG for Infinity which means increasing the diameter of the cable from 3.3mm to 4mm to be able to support functionality of QC3.0 , QC4.0 as well as Power Delivery up to 100W.    
Infinity cables will also incorporate 4x 3000D nylon braids to reinforce the strength of the cable. We've put the Infinity Cables through a bend test machine, being the cable at least 15,000 times, 180 degrees to ensure it can last through all your rigorous daily usage.  

The Infinity Cable features an anti-fray neck, meaning your cables have increased durability and less chance of fraying or snapping at the most common weak point. This anti-fray neck design significantly increases the lifespan of the cable handling everyday wear and tear.  Since UNO, we've increased the anti-fray neck to a slightly larger and more durable size without compromising the magnetic strength.

Each Infinity cable set comes with a bonus tip removal tool in a new sleek black colour which allow you to remove the tip from all your devices with ease. Please note that this tool isn't required as the tip can be easily removed with your fingers, though some people prefer using it for phones with cases or devices with depressed USB holes such as a GoPro. 
An often overlooked feature of magnetic cables is that it will protect your phone port from dust and dirt entering. By leaving the tip in there, it will also extend the life of your phone port from the normal wear and tear of cables being inserted and pulled out on a daily basis.   

Over the years we've received suggestions from our customers that we should offer a cable case to store their tips. We always thought this was a great idea so we've designed a case where you can conveniently store all your cables, tips and other accessories. Add it to your order for an exclusive Indiegogo price of $10 and never misplace a tip again! Better yet, we're throwing in a complimentary case with every cable set when you support the triple pack reward tier or greater.

<p>While our laptops and mobile devices are smaller and lighter, the power adapters have stayed pretty much the same over the years. They are still bunky, messy, and hard to carry around. With the new GaN technology becomes mature, we have built the new generation of power adapters that are much smaller, lighter, and more power-efficient. We call it SlimQ series which now include a 65W adapter and a 45W adapter and more are coming.</p>

<p>Although quite rare, international shipping may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE for those charges. It is your responsibility to clear custom for the shipped item. When customs clearance procedures are required, it is your full responsibility to make it by working with the shipping company or custom directly.</p>
<p><strong><u>It is also the recipient's responsibility for charges such as change of address, parcel holding, return fees caused by the recipient. So please make sure you have the correct address information including a phone number on file.</u></strong></p>

If you would like a shipment to any of these countries, we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more. However, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.</p>
<p><strong>2) When will my order be shipped?</strong></p>
<p>We expect to have factory to make delivery by 25th of Sept. We plan to start shipping right after the campaign is over (around <strong>30th of Sept. 2019</strong>).<br/><i>*Actual shipping dates may vary. We will keep you notified of your product ship date.</i></p>
<p><strong>It is essential to have your correct address and phone number on file.</strong> It may result in returns which are very high cost because of the incorrect address info.</p>

They are still bunky, messy, and hard to carry around. With the new GaN technology becomes mature, we have built the new generation of power adapters that are much smaller, lighter, and more power-efficient. We call it SlimQ series which now include a 65W adapter and a 45W adapter and more are coming.




 



















But if your shipping address is out of the United States, we will give one FREE converter so you can use it in those countries/regions.
eg. for the UK, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc. a UK style converter is included. For EU countries except for Germany, an EU converter is included. For South Korea and Germany, a German-style converter is included. Australia, New Zealand an AU style converter is included.
Note: we give out those converters as FREE gifts. You can also easily source one locally that better meet your needs, technically any converter would do.

If you are new to this Indiegogo site, please note 1. Indiegogo is a crowdfunding site (one of the world's most famous one), not a regular e-commerce site 2. The items sold here are called ""perks."" 3. make sure you read the shipping and refund policy carefully before purchasing.
Step 1. Select the main perk 
In the perks area, find the perk you like. For example, ""SPECIAL IGG 65 KIT"" is the 65W adapter with a free bonus cable. There are multiple perks so you may need to swipe left and right (up and down for desktop) to find the one you want. Then click ""GET THIS PERK."" Don't worry about the cables at this time, you will have chance to choose add-on cables for your laptop at later step.

2. Review selected perk
Review the perk chosen and make sure the description matches what you want. Then click ""CONTINUE TO PAYMENT.""Read the Term of Use Privacy Policy and tick the checkbox to agree. Then click ""CONTINUE TO PAYMENT"" again.

Step 3. Select add-on perk(s)
Before you click the ""CHECK OUT,"" scroll down to the ""Perks you may also like"" where you will find the cables for many types of laptops, especially those older models that don't use type-C for power supply. Make sure you select the one that is compatible with your laptop and then click ""ADD PERK"" to add it to the package. Due to the limitation of this interface, you can only add one add-on per each type. Please contact us if you need multiple cables for one type.
 
Step 4. Checkout and pay
Click the ""CHECKOUT"" button, then input your shipping address and Debit or Credit Card information (Note: It is essential to input the correct address and phone number here. We will ship to the address provided without a round of confirmation with you.).  Also, tick the checkbox to agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. 
The shipping fee will be shown once the system has your address. The shipping fee varies among different countries. For international shipping, by default, we use post service, which is not the fastest but the most reliable. If you want a different shipping method, please submit the order here and then send us a message to make different shipping arrangement. 
Finally, click the ""SUBMIT PAYMENT"" button to pay and finish the order.

 
Note: If you want multiple items or extras that can not buy here on Indiegogo, we do have a website that you can get the stuff as well. The website is shop.slimq.life.  






Although quite rare, international shipping may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees levied by the destination country. YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE for those charges. It is your responsibility to clear custom for the shipped item. When customs clearance procedures are required, it is your full responsibility to make it by working with the shipping company or custom directly.
It is also the recipient's responsibility for charges such as change of address, parcel holding, return fees caused by the recipient. So please make sure you have the correct address information including a phone number on file.
 
1) To which countries do you ship?
We ship globally excluding the following which has been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any of these countries, we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more. However, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.
2) When will my order be shipped?
We expect to have factory to make delivery by 25th of Sept. We plan to start shipping right after the campaign is over (around 30th of Sept. 2019).*Actual shipping dates may vary. We will keep you notified of your product ship date.
It is essential to have your correct address and phone number on file. It may result in returns which are very high cost because of the incorrect address info.
3) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?
Yes, and the amount will depend on your country’s regulations. 

SlimQ complies with the Indiegogo refund policy. You can cancel the backing and get fully refunded before the campaign is over or the order is still in ""Placed"" state. After the campaign finish date or we already processed the order (in ""Locked"" or ""Fulfilled"" state), there is no refund.
If you bought the product by mistake, you could contact SlimQ customer satisfaction team through info@slimq.life. We usually ask you to return the product and then issue a partial refund. Please bear in mind that we will need to deduct the charges that we already paid from the total amount. 

SlimQ hardware, including accessories, comes with a one-year limited warranty. Please contact our customer satisfaction team via info@slimq.life for any issues or feedback.

You don't want your backup battery to spend more time recharging itself than charging your devices. With its 100W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 input and Panasonic™ graphene composite batteries, it will take only 35 minutes to charge 16,000mAh (80%), or 1 hr 10min for a full charge of 20,000 mAh. This means you'll have a powerbank that's already ready to go before you are. Rule the skies with a maximum battery capacity approved by all major and minor airlines internationally. Maximum airline safe battery capacity for TSA/EASA is 27,000mAh / 100Wh, however this has been reduced in some Asian Airlines such as Air Asia where it is now 20,000mAh /100Wh. This means you could be travelling with a powerbank that will be confiscated at customs. 5x the battery life if your iPhone 11 or double the battery life of 13"" MacBook Pro with Flash's huge 20,000 mAh capacicty.  Slim enough to fit in pockets and easily grab with one hand.Despite all the power, Flash comes in a pocket-sized lightweight 470g (1lb) so you can carry the only battery that matters, that can power all your devices, wherever you go, away from the grid, without fear of ever losing power ensuring your life stays uninterrupted and always on the go. The magic to Flash's incredible specs is through incorporating 4 x 21700 Panasonic™ Lithium Polymer Graphene Composite Battery Cells. Other brands use Lithium Ion batteries which has lower energy density, is 20 - 30% cheaper to make and has a larger form factor.These batteries have been specially designed a pioneer in the electric vehicle space in partnership with Pansonic who is the manufacturer. Only launched in March 2019 and still not widely available publicly, this unique battery is presently the highest energy density battery in the world, 20% more than its predecessor. We've chosen Graphene as it's the world's most conductive material with ultra-high thermal conductivity and Graphite films are widely used in thermal applications for mobile phones and other high-power devices. These Panasonic li-po graphene composite batteries comprise of more than 15% graphene and graphite which is the ideal amount to have in a battery. Any less and the electricity conductivity will be reduced and any more the battery will be unable to function. This is a proprietary industry trade secret of the battery designer and manufacturer. We wanted to be make the most powerful USB-C battery pack so we put in not just but 1 USB-C port but we also added 2 USB-A ports and a wireless pad so that Flash will be compatible with all modern USB devices. Early product design sketches. Experimented with different shapes and determined if the wireless charging could be built in.Final prototype of FlashDimensions of Flash One of the most useful features of the graphene composite features is that is much longer lasting than traditional batteries. Each Flash powerbank is rated to last 2,000 life cycles vs only 500 cycles of the closest competitors. This means Flash has a 5 years+ battery life, which means you can use Flash every single day for 5 years and it would still seem like its brand new. WOW!Through laboratory testing equipment, we've tested the battery to last 1,836 cycles and still have a capacity above 87% (a life cycle is considered above 80%), so in reality the life cycle is far greater than 2,000 but we are being conservative in our statement of 2,000. The creating the world's most powerful powerbank, we had to create the Swiss army knife of powerbanks- one that could charge all your wired AND wireless devices, truly replacing all your chargers and wireless pads with just 1 device.Not only does Flash support USB-C 100W Power Delivery 3.0 and Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 which are the 2 international standards for fast charge technology, we've included a specially designed USB-A port with Android users in mind. Finally a powerbank that supports Huawei Super Charge , Oppo & Oneplus (22.5W) as well as OPPO SVOOC (40W).Users of these brands know the frustrations they must go through as normally you only experience these proprietary fast charge speeds when you purchase the original brand's charger or powerbank. With all new phones supporting wireless charging this is a must have feature for those want the ease of drop-and-go charging. Flash support 10W Fast Wireless Charging for all wireless devices including phones and Apple Airpods. We will also applying for a Qi Certification once the stretch goal is reached, although this isn't required for compatibility.Wireless charging works through electromagnetic induction with a sender coil in the powerbank and a receiver coil built into the back of the phone. This coil is shielded with a 1.5mm thick tempered glass which will allow the electromagnetic energy to pass through. This glass, in the shape of a circle has been chemical tempered in potassium nitrate for 4 hours at 400°C (752°F) ensuring the glass is drop proof and able to take on all the bangs and drops you experience in your day.Please note: It is not recommended to use the wireless charger when the powerbank is at less than 2% and this is a standard with all wireless chargers. We didn't stop there, Apple watch fans we've built this with you in mind! Our wireless pad also encompasses a 2.5W Apple watch coil to charge your Apple watch. Apple watch users know the frustration of having to always carry their wireless pad around since its so hard to find wireless pads and powerbanks that work with your Apple watch and if they do, they are usually very expensive.   When using the wireless charger, it can take up to 3 seconds for your device to begin charging as the pad is detecting if its a Apple Watch or iPhone due to the dual coil setup. While designing a high capacity battery, we still wanted a highly compact and portable solution. We've chosen Aircraft grade anodised aluminium as the shell enclosure material due to being strong yet thin and malleable enough to follow the lines of the battery cells, wrapping and protecting it with minimal space wastage. Aluminium is also a very good at heat dissipation to keep the battery cool at all times. The minimalist aluminium design is efficient, functional and matches the MacBook perfectly. Don't you just hate it when your powerbank indicator is just a few small LED lights that keep changing each time you check it? Flash has been built with a numbered LED indicator with high accuracy so you know EXACTLY how much juice you have left so you're never left guessing. This is only possible with graphene powerbanks as the accuracy of numbered indicators with standard li-ion batteries is very inconsistent. To make the LED indicator more accurate, 0% - 50% is 80% of the battery's capacity (16,000mAh) and the last 20% is 51% - 100% (4,000mAh). This means it's really normal for the battery to appear that it's discharging quickly. The LED indicator is based on charging time and not capacity, which is why its designed this way. Flash comes with a power button, once pressed the power will output from all ports and the wireless pad for 16 seconds. The white LED indicator stays on and is for the ports whilst the blue LED indicator starts blinking and is for the wireless pad. If a device is connected to any of the 3 ports within this time, a white indicator light will stay on showing the power is being used. If a device is connected to the wireless pad, the blue light will blink showing the device is being charged wirelessly. What's convenient is you can charge Flash with your existing Macbook 15"" or 16"" Pro wall at 100% max speed. Flash is also compatible with all other standard USB-C chargers already used by your devices including Macbook 12 or 13"", USB-C, Dell XPS 13/15 and more.For those who don't carry any of these devices, we also offer a range of wall chargers capable of outputting the 100W needed to charge Flash at full speed. Not only fast and powerful, the Graphene battery technology also makes Flash the world’s safest powerbank by allowing it to fast charge at low temperatures compared to standard batteries. Flash will never go above 50°C (122°F) unlike competitor powerbanks which can reach 70°C (167°F) ensuring it is safer and also longer lasting.  You'll feel very comfortable knowing that this baby won't heat up or bulge over time like you see in many of your older USB devices. Graphene composite batteries have much smaller internal resistance and better conductivity than traditional li-po batteries. Graphene composite is also added to both the positive and negative poles of the battery cell to further increase the conductivity. Due to the unique thermal dissipation properties of Graphene, no further cooling mechanisms such as heat sinks are required allowing us to keep Flash as thin and light as possible. A company's battery chemical structure is a trade secret which isn't shared publicly or to most of a company's staff. One major reason is other companies will copy their technology which is why many leading brands only put li-po only on their battery. This stands for ""lithium polymer"" which means it’s a lithium-ion (li-ion) battery with additives of other special materials one of which in this case is Graphene which is able to significantly alter the batteries properties enough to differentiate it. This is the battery chemical composition report for the Panasonic 21700 batteries found inside Flash:At the request of the battery companies we have withheld full details of 3 of the ingredients. Though with some research you can easily discover 1 of the compounds found in all electric vehicle batteries is Cobalt. Unsurprisingly there are over a dozen ingredients that make up this complicated graphene battery which is the result of a decades of battery technology research and testing- hence why battery companies like to keep this mixture a company trade secret. In order to achieve international certification for safe use, all powerbanks are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure Flash can withstand daily use- even the most extreme of circumstances.TEMPERATURE TESTEach powerbank is placed into a temperature chamber and exposed to extreme temperatures of -10°C to 65°C. In the event Flash is exposed to these temperatures, once its been moved to the safe operating temperature it will work perfectly fine.Device Operating Temperature: -10ºC (14°F) to 60ºC (140°F)CHARGE/DISCHARGE TESTEach powerbank is charged and discharged from 0 - 100% 4 times to pass quality control. Each powerbank will be charged to 100% when shipped so you'll receive a product that's ready out of the box.DROP TESTThe powerbank is dropped from each of the 6 sides at a height of 1.2m (3.9ft) onto a 10cm (3.9"")  wooden plate. This test is important to ensure Flash can handle all the accidental drops that you will experience in your daily life.SHAKING TESTEach unit is put through a shaking test machine which shakes as a frequency range of 5Hz to 500Hz and tested on each of the X, Y and Z axis for 1 hour.HUMIDITY TESTEach powerbank is subjected to a high humidity environment of 60% - 90% and tested to ensure it still works under these conditions.STATIC TESTDuring this test the powerbank has a contact discharge voltage of 2000V and gap discharging voltage of 2000V. We're setting a new standard with a 2 year international warranty, doubling the current standard of 1 year. This is only possible for Flash due to the use of Graphene batteries which have a battery life greater than 5 years, compared to other batteries which are only protected by a 1 year warranty.  As an early supporter, you also unlock access to a range of Chargeasap's innovative products at a huge discount such as the Infinity cable.  You can add these products to your order after the campaign finishes.

<p>Unlike any other portable monitors that only work with a few phone models like Samsung DeX phones, <strong>PhonePad is universally compatible with ALL smartphones, including iPhones</strong>. All you need is just your phone and the charging cable, no WiFi, no other smartphone streaming devices required.</p>
<p>PhonePad also works with other HDMI enabled devices, including laptops, game consoles, and SLR cameras - providing a more expansive view for work or play. </p>

<p>Your smartphone is an extremely powerful computer. Imagine what you could do with your phone if you weren't limited by screen size. Programs like PowerPoint can run on a phone, but it is impossible to work efficiently with the small screen and on-screen keyboard.</p>
<p>PhonePad unleashes the productivity of your smartphone so you can do more with it. PhonePad allows you to work with your phone like you would with a laptop computer(just add a keyboard and mouse).</p>

<p>According to a Microsoft study, the use of <strong>an extra monitor can increase productivity by as much as 50%</strong>; which means you can save up to 2.7 hours per day, 13 hours per week, or 29 full days per year!</p>
<p>When off work, you can also pair PhonePad with game consoles like Nintendo Switch, PS4, or Xbox to play your favorite games at home or anywhere life takes you.</p>

<p>Our Reverse Control Technology* <strong>enables you to control your phone game on the 15.6"" touchscreen.</strong> So when playing TFT, you can really focus on tactics, not deploying champions into small cells.</p>
<p>Our technology also <strong>empowers your play with a controller/keyboard+mouse</strong>. So you can dominate the CoD battlefield with more precise control and quicker actions.</p>
<p>PhonePad is not an emulator so you don't need to worry about getting banned. Our AI algorithm learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same thing (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen). Our engineers have tested thousands of different games, including CoD, PUBG, and Fortnite. No tester has been banned so far.**</p>

<p> You might have seen other portable monitors claim that they are ""universally compatible"". <strong>What they didn't tell you is</strong>: they require additional streaming devices like Chromecast and WiFi to work with most phones. Even with a Chromecast, other portable monitors' touchscreen function doesn't work with your phone, which means you can view the content but cannot control it.</p>
<p>In contrast, our ESM technology enables ""reverse controlling"" your phone from the big touchscreen or a keyboard/mouse/game controller. </p>

<p>You can touch, draw, or write notes on the 15.6"" multitouch screen, just like you would on an iPad / tablet.</p>
<p>You buy a new phone every 1-2 years, but you rarely upgrade your tablet or computer that often. Since upgrading your phone also upgrades the ""CPU"" of PhonePad, now you also get a new tablet for every phone grade.</p>

We need your help to put PhonePad into large-scale mass production, and we sincerely thank you for your support.</p>
</div></div>","Unlike any other portable monitors that only work with a few phone models like Samsung DeX phones, PhonePad is universally compatible with ALL smartphones, including iPhones. All you need is just your phone and the charging cable, no WiFi, no other smartphone streaming devices required.
PhonePad also works with other HDMI enabled devices, including laptops, game consoles, and SLR cameras - providing a more expansive view for work or play. 
 


 

 
Your smartphone is an extremely powerful computer. Imagine what you could do with your phone if you weren't limited by screen size. Programs like PowerPoint can run on a phone, but it is impossible to work efficiently with the small screen and on-screen keyboard.
PhonePad unleashes the productivity of your smartphone so you can do more with it. PhonePad allows you to work with your phone like you would with a laptop computer(just add a keyboard and mouse).
 

 

 
According to a Microsoft study, the use of an extra monitor can increase productivity by as much as 50%; which means you can save up to 2.7 hours per day, 13 hours per week, or 29 full days per year!
When off work, you can also pair PhonePad with game consoles like Nintendo Switch, PS4, or Xbox to play your favorite games at home or anywhere life takes you.
 

 

Our Reverse Control Technology* enables you to control your phone game on the 15.6"" touchscreen. So when playing TFT, you can really focus on tactics, not deploying champions into small cells.
Our technology also empowers your play with a controller/keyboard+mouse. So you can dominate the CoD battlefield with more precise control and quicker actions.
PhonePad is not an emulator so you don't need to worry about getting banned. Our AI algorithm learns how your fingers control your phone, and it simulates the same thing (it's like virtual fingers floating on your phone's touchscreen). Our engineers have tested thousands of different games, including CoD, PUBG, and Fortnite. No tester has been banned so far.**
*Mobile gaming function is not available for iOS 13.4 and above versions.
** You should always check the terms of use for the game that you play and comply with it.
 


 You might have seen other portable monitors claim that they are ""universally compatible"". What they didn't tell you is: they require additional streaming devices like Chromecast and WiFi to work with most phones. Even with a Chromecast, other portable monitors' touchscreen function doesn't work with your phone, which means you can view the content but cannot control it.
In contrast, our ESM technology enables ""reverse controlling"" your phone from the big touchscreen or a keyboard/mouse/game controller. 



 
You can touch, draw, or write notes on the 15.6"" multitouch screen, just like you would on an iPad / tablet.
You buy a new phone every 1-2 years, but you rarely upgrade your tablet or computer that often. Since upgrading your phone also upgrades the ""CPU"" of PhonePad, now you also get a new tablet for every phone grade.


 

When mirroring your phone content to other portable monitors with the help of a streaming device, your portrait phone content can only be displayed at the center of their landscape screens (with two thick black bars on the sides).
Our portrait mode technology can rotate and fill your portrait phone content to the entire big screen.
 

 

PhonePad is just 0.2 inches (4.9 mm) thin and weighs only 0.95 lbs. (860 g). We worked so hard on every single millimeter, just to make it perfect for those who are always on the go.
 

 *Mac OS does not support the touch function of external monitors
 
 



You will receive a survey after the campaign ends, in which you can add a built-in battery ($29.9) and a smart cover stand ($9.9) for ultimate portability.
 


We already made 100 PhonePads with our own investment. We are shipping those units to our earliest backers, and they will receive their PhonePads even before the campaign is over.
However, we need your help to move into large-scale mass production and bring this new kind of portable monitor to more people. We are very confident about our November main batch fulfillment promise, and we guarantee to give your money back if we can't keep this promise.   

 

 

 

This is not our first Indiegogo campaign. We successfully shipped over 385 AnyConsole Mini to our backers in more than 70 countries around the world. We're thrilled to see these backers out there using and enjoying their AnyConsole Mini today.

Now, we are glad to introduce our next-gen phone gimbal - ATOM 2, the world's first auto-foldable 3-axis phone gimbal!  Thanks for the great support that made us $200k funded! Now, all the backers will get a FREE Snoppa Hand Strap along with each ATOM 2! Grab yours if you are not in!    ATOM 2 is the world’s first auto-foldable 3-axis phone gimbal that is pocket size. It senses your action for auto startup and folding, making it a hassle-free phone filming assistant. With a built-in tripod and an extendable handle, ATOM 2 is perfect for go-anywhere phone-filming, vlogging, live-streaming, and selfies!      All the 3-axis foldable gimbals on the market require manual operation which is a little bit troublesome and adds a time-consuming extra step that might make you miss the shot.One Step VS Four StepsATOM 2 can instantly sense your opening & closing actions to automatically control the gimbal arm's movements, giving you a more convenient grab-and-shoot experience.     Carrying the ATOM 2 around is as easy as placing it in a pocket or bag. Thanks to the ingenious hybrid 3-axis structural design, ATOM 2 breaks free from bulky conventional designs and significantly reduces the gimbal size to an incredible degree.    Compared with 1 or 2 axes selfie-stick style gimbals, a 3-axis gimbal can best eliminate shakes and jitters in all 3 axes of roll, tilt and pan, balancing the phone camera in real-time which results in smooth and steady videos. Hybrid-3-axis Anti-Shake TechATOM 2 utilizes Snoppa’s latest patented design—the hybrid 3-axis anti-shake structure which is the soul of ATOM 2.The roll and pan axes both use a direct-drive brushless motor while the tilt axis uses a special hybrid brushless motor self-developed by Snoppa. It has a much higher torsion and excellent stabilizing performance, which cannot be found in any other gimbal.         Carrying accessories is always cumbersome so ATOM 2 eliminates the need for additional gear, it has an extendable handle, allowing you to take better selfie shots with a wider field of view. With the integrated tripod, you can stand it directly on any flat surface for hands-free filming techniques such as time-lapse, auto-tracking, etc. Get the shot every time and everywhere!    ATOM 2 is currently the only gimbal that supports fast charging. It takes only 1 hour to charge from empty to full, or 40 minutes charging to reach 80%. Inside there’s a built-in temperature sensor that can detect the battery status in real-time to ensure safety.     One Key Orientation Switch    ATOM 2 has an embedded infrared sensor in the gimbal phone holder, which can actively sense the phone mounting status to prevent the motor from starting before the phone is mounted – helping to avoid motor damage.     The ATOM 2 also includes a dedicated filming app that offers powerful functions for users to enhance their shooting experience like AI recognition and tracking, time-lapse, slow motion, panorama, beauty mode, gesture control, and more.Beauty ModeNot looking your best? Want to add a little personality to your beauty? ATOM 2's beauty mode helps you edit images and video to bring out your best features in both your selfie pictures and vlogs. Faceover & FacemaskingThrough AI face detection, the Faceover Mode enables users to automatically cover their faces with either pixels or a selected cartoon sticker during face tracking. AI Gesture ControlsControl the gimbal hands-free or remotely, it’s all up to you!

<p>RaVolt is the only recharging
product on the market that does not require a cable, and in fact does not even
need to plug into your normal charging port. Other types of external batteries
must be rated for the correct voltage to match your device. On top of that,
they must fit the size and style of your charging port, which varies
drastically from device to device, even within the same brand. Because RaVolt
works through the USB port, it is more compact and easy to use with almost any
device. </p>
<p>The best thing about RaVolt is that
you don’t even need to worry about recharging it through a wall outlet. You can
recharge RaVolt in exactly the same way you use it to charge your other
devices: by plugging it into the USB port of your laptop. This, combine with
its automatic ability to adapt to the correct voltage makes it by far the most
convenient, useful, and affordable external battery device on the market. On a
full charge, RaVolt can charge a Macbook Pro multiple times, and an iPhone 6
over mulipletimes. Imagine the difference that can make to the way you travel,
work, and socialize online.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436311192/jlu71x8j8neyymuk1fbd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span>•</span>Power:

for those who are able to donate the money we will need to make this happen.
The funds gathered from this campaign will allow us to produce our first run,
and go towards letting the world know that this solution exists. The more we
can produce in a single run, the cheaper the price per unit will be! Take
advantage of the special low prices we are offering during this campaign,
because you won’t always be able to get RaVolt this cheap. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>Tell Your Friends</b></p>
<p>If you’ve ever wished it was easier
to keep your devices charged on the go, then you should already see the
enormous value of RaVolt We’d like to serve as an inspiration for other
entrepreneurs and startup enterprises to get out there and release their innovations
to the world through the crowdfunding model. We know a lot of people who need a
solution like this, so tell your friends to contribute so we can promote it to
the world. Sharing this campaign on your social media profile is just as
valuable to us as an actual financial pledge.</p><br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/><br/></div>","RaVolt

Although RaVolt is designed and
ready for distribution, we still need funds to put into promotion and marketing
so we can build an audience. We’d like to offer as many incentives as possible
for those who are able to donate the money we will need to make this happen.
The funds gathered from this campaign will allow us to produce our first run,
and go towards letting the world know that this solution exists. The more we
can produce in a single run, the cheaper the price per unit will be! Take
advantage of the special low prices we are offering during this campaign,
because you won’t always be able to get RaVolt this cheap. Tell Your Friends
If you’ve ever wished it was easier
to keep your devices charged on the go, then you should already see the
enormous value of RaVolt We’d like to serve as an inspiration for other
entrepreneurs and startup enterprises to get out there and release their innovations
to the world through the crowdfunding model. We know a lot of people who need a
solution like this, so tell your friends to contribute so we can promote it to
the world. Sharing this campaign on your social media profile is just as
valuable to us as an actual financial pledge.",15.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><b>HOW HAEMERIS IS DIFFERENT?</b><br/><br/>So many devices available on the market have indeed nice functions which are however offered individually. For instance, even though a message is sent to the police the aggressor as still the time to do his horrendous deed and run away before the police turns up. HAEMERIS is the combination of all functions one can think of in one device (with tiny accessories). Let's review the functions which make HAEMERIS so unique and so safe.<br/><br/><p></p>

<br/>
<br/><b>The HAEMERIS Wings </b><br/>Before going through the comprehensive functions of the HAEMERIS, it is important to introduce this mini-tiny device called the HAEMERIS Wings attached the shirt behind the buttons or on an underwear will have one of its wings ripped if the aggresor tears or pulled violently the woman's colthes (which is always the case). This will activate the bracelet and a series of actions (see below) will take place. The wings has double-face stickers on them to hold well on the clothes. If (or when) the stickers do not stick anymore, they can be replaced with new stickers.<br/><br/><p></p>

     第一时间得到你的Bablr！“管理你的世界”短袖衫（额外送给投资者的小礼物）


 




The first mobile social networking apps were from established socialmedia sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. These apps are just simple mobile expressions of their websites. These 1st generation apps  (mobile networking 1.0)  are quite old and offer nothing new, They are towers of isolated functions and processes with limited integration among the various social network mobile apps .(Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,LinkedIn,Google+,WhatsApp).




第一批社交网络APP来自Facebook, Twitter和Instagram. 这些APP只是简单的对其网站再呈现。第一代APP（社交网络1.0版）非常陈旧没有新意。他们是各种社交网络移动应用程序在有限的集成功能和过程的分离塔。(Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,LinkedIn,Google+,WhatsApp). 





These 1st generation mobile socialmedia apps (mobile networking 1.0) from Facebook and others were built with the idea of keeping you the user exclusively on their sites, but that is not the usage TREND of mobile consumers. Mobile consumers typically interact with Facebook then move on to multiple sources of social media, liking, friend-finding, posting and messaging along the way. In addition,  there are now over 1 million apps for your smartphone, which has lead to app and social media overload. Consumers are becoming overwhelmed by app overload and are tired of wasting time and energy  on their smartphone or tablet going from one app to another just trying to keep up!





第一代来自Fackbook和其它移动社交媒体的APP（移动社交1.0版）建立在把用户留住在自己的网站上的理念，但这不符合手机用户的使用习惯。手机用户经常在Facebook和多个社交媒体上发表喜好、寻找朋友、分享图片文字、留言发表评论，等等。此外，现在有超过一百万的手机APP，这导致了应用程序和社交媒体过载。APP过载使用户浪费时间和精力而不堪重负，他们忙碌繁琐的使用智能手机或平板电脑从一个APP切换到另外一个APP！



Save Time   

 省时


 



Bablr was designed as an evolution of how people actually use their smartphones, socialmedia and apps, Bablr moves the user from away from wasting time opening and closing 1st generation socialmedia apps to having all social networking available universally  at the same timein one app which is the way people actually want to use their smartphones to social network!


Bablr被设计为人们如何使用他们的智能手机、社交媒体和APP的演变。Bablr让用户可以轻松的在一个应用程序中使用各种社交媒体APP，不再浪费时间打开和关闭各个APP，这才是人们想要的智能生活！



Bablr's platform integrates Facebook,Twitter,Instagram with messaging and sharing across platforms, turning isolated standalone socialmedia streams into an   easily accessible social networking management application all in one app.


Bablr集成了facebook，Twitter，Instagram,可以在Bablr一个平台上面实现跨平台的交流分享。使各自独立的平台更加容易管理。



Bablr is the evolution of mobile networking to mobile 2.0 Technology. It makes life simpler not harder.  Bablr, a Revolution born out of Evolution!


bablr是移动网络技术向2.0版的演变。它使生活更简单，不难。bablr出世，革命的演变！












Take control of your Digital Life... 

The Revolution is here now!  


控制你的数字生活…
变革就从这里开始！

Multiple Social Networks On One Platform 

多个社交媒体集成在一个平台上




Market Research From Pew and industry experts show that smartphone and tablet   consumers spend at least 30 minutes each day on mobile social networking, visiting sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, opening and closing as many as 9 separate apps each session.


Pew的市场研究表明，智能手机和平板电脑的消费者每天花至少30分钟在移动社交网络上，访问网站如facebook，Twitter和Instagram，打开和关闭多达9个不同的APP。





 CrowdFunding: Why We Love IndieGoGo! 众筹：我们为什么喜欢Indiegogo

We have  researched the smartphone/socialmedia market extensively,what we found  out is that there are some integrating  solutions for socialmedia and communications on the PC Desktop,but there no solutions built and designed specifically to integrate the consumer's digital Life on mobile devices
We want Bablr to become platform of choice for the global smartphone/social-networking market.In order to achieve our goal we must fund Bablr and get it to market Now!


研究了智能手机/社交媒体市场，我们发现有一些基于电脑桌面的社交媒体解决方案，但没有专为移动APP社交媒体集成的数字生活解决方案。
我们希望bablr成为全球智能手机/社交网络市场的首选平台。为了实现我们的目标，我们必须为bablr融资！

<p>Some
risks that Limitless Peak may encounter include competition,
disputes with our manufacturer, inventory management and the language barrier.  We plan to overcome these obstacles in many different fashions.  First, by
enforcing our competition with a differentiation strategy, in the sense that
our helmet has both the Bluetooth capability of using both the music and phone
functions on smart devices, as well as Bluetooth hands free headset
incorporated into the helmet.  Additionally as part of our differentiation
strategy we are incorporating a social entrepreneurship aspect, in giving a
percentage of our profits back to our community.  On the basis of disputes and
language barriers with our manufacturer, we have already set in place to hire a
translator to help minimize language barriers between the Limitless Peak corporate staff
and our manufacturer.  Finally, when it comes to inventory management; we have set in place to hire multiple independent contractors to work within
the warehouse, as well as an Information Technology Manager to manage inventory
going in and out of the warehouse.  Together lets Peak to success.  Together we are Limitless.</p>

<p>Wallgers is our new line of fashionable and functional wallets and will have the same detail and focus on craftsmanship, design, and quality materials. Each will be handcrafted for us by small shops so we can keep tight quality control. That’s what makes Wallgers look and perform better than other “RFID wallets with phone chargers”. We designed the wallet with the battery pack at the same time so they fit without looking like they were thrown together by a charger manufacturer. </p>

<p>We are not in the business of making cheaper products with lower quality materials just for the sake of volume sales. Our philosophy is to use the best materials and hire the best shops to produce (not manufacture) accessories that look good, perform better, and last longer. </p>
<p><b>For quality assurance, all Wallgers will be inspected, tested, and hand assembled in the USA. </b></p>

Each will be handcrafted for us by small shops so we can keep tight quality control. That’s what makes Wallgers look and perform better than other “RFID wallets with phone chargers”. We designed the wallet with the battery pack at the same time so they fit without looking like they were thrown together by a charger manufacturer. 

Brown or Black Full Grain Leather
We are not in the business of making cheaper products with lower quality materials just for the sake of volume sales. Our philosophy is to use the best materials and hire the best shops to produce (not manufacture) accessories that look good, perform better, and last longer. 
For quality assurance, all Wallgers will be inspected, tested, and hand assembled in the USA. 
Should your Wallger need repair or replacement within the first year, it will be taken care of at no charge. Lifetime Free Battery Replacement Labor If the lithium ion batteries ever need replacement, we will replace it without any labor charge.

<p><b>The Life Mounts LED Pack Light attaches to the shoulder strap of any 
sized pack and provides forward facing light.  The powerful LED 
flashlight has 3 modes, operates on one AA battery and can be seen for 
over 1,000 feet. The patented universal mount is made of durable 
silicone rubber and attaches with secure velcro straps meaning your 
light will fit and stay exactly where you put it but can also be easily

<b>It's All About The Mount!<br/><br/></b>Every backpack strap is different and having a mount that adapts to every pack on the market is essential.  The Life Mounts strap mount was specifically designed to adapt to day packs, backpacking packs, kid carriers, camel backs, and school packs.  The attachment straps that secure the mount and light to your pack provide a comfortable and secure fit.  The silicone rubber mount raises the light up off the shoulder strap to allow for optimal positioning and unobstructed shine. In addition, it flexes to adapt to any sized flashlight you may put in it.<b><br/></b><br/>

<br/>The first LED Pack Light and Mount was born from a need for hands-free

</div></div>","Remember when flashlights were hand-held only? Now can you imagine a camping trip without your trusty headlamp?
 Life Mounts is a small company with a BIG, yet simple, idea.  We want to shake up the outdoor adventure community with a totally new perspective on hands-free lighting.

The Life Mounts LED Pack Light attaches to the shoulder strap of any 
sized pack and provides forward facing light.  The powerful LED 
flashlight has 3 modes, operates on one AA battery and can be seen for 
over 1,000 feet. The patented universal mount is made of durable 
silicone rubber and attaches with secure velcro straps meaning your 
light will fit and stay exactly where you put it but can also be easily 
removed for hand-held use.




Features:
• Bright, Water Resistant, and Shockproof 300 Lumen LED Light with 3 Modes: High, Low, and Safety Strobe• Durable, Weatherproof Silicone Rubber Mount with Easy-to-Use Velcro Attachment Straps• Dimensions: 3.5""L x 1.5""W x 1.25""H and 3.4oz (w/ battery)• Burn time of 2.5hrs on high and 20+hrs on low
It's All About The Mount!Every backpack strap is different and having a mount that adapts to every pack on the market is essential.  The Life Mounts strap mount was specifically designed to adapt to day packs, backpacking packs, kid carriers, camel backs, and school packs.  The attachment straps that secure the mount and light to your pack provide a comfortable and secure fit.  The silicone rubber mount raises the light up off the shoulder strap to allow for optimal positioning and unobstructed shine. In addition, it flexes to adapt to any sized flashlight you may put in it.


The first LED Pack Light and Mount was born from a need for hands-free 
light underwater.  Life Mounts founder, Christoph Pierre, designed the 
custom mount to attach to his BCD for use doing marine science research 
projects.  He quickly saw the use on his day pack and backpacking pack.The prototypes of the first LED Pack Lights are currently on the packs of gear editors and testers at Outside and Backpacker magazines.  We  need your support to get them on the packs of everyone else.

Since Life Mounts is a small company, we are able to maintain control over every aspect of the design, testing, and production process.  We take extreme pride in everything we build knowing that each and every light and mount will help someone lead a safer and healthier life.We would love for you to become one of the very first people to experience the LED Pack Light first hand.Donate Now!!

Risks & Challenges
 When the lamp comes into massive production, there is no doubt that we want to make a perfect processing on every detail, especially the metal part, to whose quality we pay the most attention. Our great efforts on perfecting details increase the rate of unqualified products and slow down the production as well, driving up the final cost. Therefore, we have to make a better control over the production.

<h3>Mailtrain</h3>
<p>I want to build the best email marketing application that runs on your own server and is completely <i>open source</i>.

<p></p>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>After years of developing high performance software libraries to allow other applications send email messages, for example <a href=""http://nodemailer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nodemailer</a> that powers the sending of millions of messages every day, I ended up in a situation where I needed to send some newsletters of my own. Unfortunately there didn't seem to be a solid <i>open source</i> self hosted solution available.</p>
<p>Sure, there are tons of services providing this for free or for a small fee as long as the subscriber list is not too large, but there's this special feeling of actually owning your own data that these services can't provide. You never know what kind of monkey business your service provider might decide to do. Anyone remembers that monkey-themed transactional email service and what happened to it? If you do, then you might appreciate not having such surprises on short notice that came with it.</p>
<p>So, I ended up creating my own solution to this problem, a newsletter application called Mailtrain, available at <a href=""https://mailtrain.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mailtrain.org</a>. The work is huge though and I need your help to keep building it.</p>
<p></p><h3>What I plan to do</h3>Depending on the amount of funds I'm able to raise I'm going to devote my time into developing  Mailtrain further. A lot has happened since the initial launch, I've added many features like RSS campaigns, GPG encryption, click statistics, scheduling, etc., but there is still much left to do. Most requested feature so far has been autoresponders/drip campaigns and I would like to spend some time on adding first class automation into Mailtrain. I also plan to set up a to-do list and all backers can vote the most important features that should be implemented next.</div>","Mailtrain

One of them works with Android and iOS using a custom app called Nold and lets you manage &amp; share access for your garage, even in the cloud. This will be available in 2016 december.

Therefore, in most cases, you’ll be just fine without a screen protector.However, for the scratch test for the iPhone, we realize that the screen does scratch from a razor blade. And if you constantly expose your iPhone to your keys and other sharper objects, you will most likely end up with a scratched display eventually. Moreover, for the worst-case scenario, the screen will crack if it is dropped accidentally.This is why screen protector can actually be useful.Screen protectors can actually save the day, protecting your iPhone from scratches, puncture, etc. However, it is not easy for the screen protector installation by most of us.

Here's Where You Come In
We have been working on Palmzi for more than a year, and we know that it is a useful, one-of-a-kind product that will support millions of mobile users as they go about living their digital lives.  We are looking for health-conscious, forward thinkers like you to help them do that while combatting the negative impacts of poor posture.  But working with designers, prototyping, factory chains and patent processes can be extremely expensive.  We need your support to bring the Palmzi to the marketplace so you, your loved ones and millions of others can keep streaming, texting, reading, working, and swiping in comfort. 
So Why Should You Support Us?

You’ll be the first to get a Palmzi.
You’ll never look at your mobile device the same way again.
You secretly love good posture.


What You Should Know

Our goal is to raise $100,000 to fund the production, distribution, and marketing of the Palmzi. Our team consists of the Palmzi inventor, an invention and patent consultant, web and marketing team and some legal help. Every penny of the funds we collect will be used to make the best product possible while delivering a solution that is affordable for the masses.

Our team has taken products to market before and understands the challenges and obstacles.
Years of thought, research and planning have gone into the design of Palmzi.



Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute now, we would still like your help in the following ways:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about the Palmzi on social media.
Use the Indiegogo tools to help share this campaign.
Remind your loved ones about the dangers of poor posture when using mobile devices.
Recommend the Palmzi to your friends, family, colleagues and even medical professionals.

We ask that you take this epidemic seriously and help us spread awareness through this campaign.Frequently Asked QuestionsPlease let us know if you have any more questions!Copyright © 2017 MCD Solutions Limited1 We Are Social’s Digital in 2017: Global Overview2 TechCrunch.com3 BBC News4 TheJournal.com5 Association of American Publishers annual survey",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p>T-PEOS carried out monitoring for i-Phone users “What is the most needed features to the iPhone?”As a result, The most wanted function
among the answers is “Call Recording”. Whatever the reason, iPhone users feel
some difficulties because there is no built-in call recording function, even it
has very positive role in many cases during business or private conversation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>imemo® </b>is developed by the motivation to satisfy that the
most wanted needs of i-Phone users, Call Recording. T-PEOS considers the most affordable, compact
and robust design with integrated multi-function which could be acceptable in
this limited space adding Voice Recording, Music Amplifier and USB Memory
functions.</p>
<p>Taking into account some potential disadvantages of
wireless devices based on Bluetooth, the final product concept of development
of <b>imemo</b>® is wired and focused on the most
affordable, robust, simple, compact, long lasting and even multi-function.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463733112/%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80_%EB%AA%A8%EC%9D%8C2_qmmn0v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In particular,
Ben Hur, CEO of T-PEOS and an acoustic expert over 30 years, is proud of
combining his acoustic technology adding Audio Amplifier in <b>imemo</b>®. We wish it could
be a nice benefit for audiophiles. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463667236/%EC%9D%8C%EC%95%85%EB%93%A3%EB%8A%94_%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80_rzjqas.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why is imemo® unique as a Call Recorder</h3>
<div>
<p>If the
device adopts only call recording function, we do not know when to use during
everyday routine life. But the problem is when you suddenly need to take notes, while
driving or walking or if you do not have a pen in case of important phone call.
You may face the same situation and experience once.  </p>
<p>It
is quite different that you <b>do not use</b>
even there is an available function from that you <b>can not use </b>at the critical moment because there is no available
function.</p>
<p>We consider how to make iPhone users be familiar with <b>imemo</b>® as a call recorder, because it should be useful in critical situation. That is why we put the audio amplifier in  <b>imemo</b>®. Then users can always enjoy rich sound music through <b>imemo</b>® any time at any place using users' own earphone. </p>
<p>If you
receive a phone call and need to record the conversation while you enjoying music,
just press Record button to start call recording.</p>
<p>Furthermore <b>imemo</b>® is compact enough to carry in
the pouch of a laptop or tablet, just like you have one more USB memory in your bag.</p>

</div>","Introduction

T-PEOS carried out monitoring for i-Phone users “What is the most needed features to the iPhone?”As a result, The most wanted function
among the answers is “Call Recording”. Whatever the reason, iPhone users feel
some difficulties because there is no built-in call recording function, even it
has very positive role in many cases during business or private conversation.

imemo® is developed by the motivation to satisfy that the
most wanted needs of i-Phone users, Call Recording. T-PEOS considers the most affordable, compact
and robust design with integrated multi-function which could be acceptable in
this limited space adding Voice Recording, Music Amplifier and USB Memory
functions.
Taking into account some potential disadvantages of
wireless devices based on Bluetooth, the final product concept of development
of imemo® is wired and focused on the most
affordable, robust, simple, compact, long lasting and even multi-function.



In particular,
Ben Hur, CEO of T-PEOS and an acoustic expert over 30 years, is proud of
combining his acoustic technology adding Audio Amplifier in imemo®. We wish it could
be a nice benefit for audiophiles. 




Why is imemo® unique as a Call Recorder

If the
device adopts only call recording function, we do not know when to use during
everyday routine life. But the problem is when you suddenly need to take notes, while
driving or walking or if you do not have a pen in case of important phone call.
You may face the same situation and experience once.  
It
is quite different that you do not use
even there is an available function from that you can not use at the critical moment because there is no available
function.
We consider how to make iPhone users be familiar with imemo® as a call recorder, because it should be useful in critical situation. That is why we put the audio amplifier in  imemo®. Then users can always enjoy rich sound music through imemo® any time at any place using users' own earphone. 
If you
receive a phone call and need to record the conversation while you enjoying music,
just press Record button to start call recording.
Furthermore imemo® is compact enough to carry in
the pouch of a laptop or tablet, just like you have one more USB memory in your bag.



imemo® Integrated Functions

Well-made imemo®
In mid-2015 after
confirming the needs for a call recording function of iPhone users, T-PEOS set
out to develop the revised design and functionality. In April 2016 the prototype
of its current appearance is completed. We are ready to make tools and molds
for mass production and backer’s cheer up. 
The mass production
of  imemo® for shipment can
be finished within 2 months after this campaign. So the expected shipment could
be within August 2016. Of course Rasiel is already in mass
production.


Risks & Challenges

Because imemo® has already proven the technical part through a complete working sample, we are
confident that there is no technical risk. And also, T-PEOS, former company
name SWP Shinwoo, is performing successful business in acoustic industry and
verified well in the market through many reviews in Head-Fi.org and its global
distribution channels.


How to use fund

Technical issues have already been
solved through the R&D. The funds secured through this campaign will be used

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brian Bedeau and I am the founder of Lockabea. My Wife and I started this journey 3 ½ years ago to build a solution for child and personal safety. My Wife is a nurse here in Toronto, CA and I am an IT Professional with a Computer Engineering background. As parents of 7 children, collectively, a few things remain consistent, we want them to be safe and always have access to an emergency device. We’ve had family members with dementia and we know how difficult it can become for family members and caretakers. But, the experience that began this journey of developing Lockabea was an unfortunate event which occurred with a little boy from Toronto. He managed to leave his home in the middle of the cold winter night only wearing a T-shirt, diaper and boots. The city of Toronto looked for him together, praying that he would be found well, he wasn’t. I was broken for weeks and remember shedding tears over the freshly drawn concept drawings for what we now call Lockabea. The only thought I had was, “this technology has been around for years, it’s time to make use of it”. We realized many people from all walks of life could use a device like this, Alzheimer’s and dementia patients, autistic children, young adults, students and even adults. Help us establish useful technology that can change and save many lives across the world with the complete development and distribution of Lockabea.<br/><br/><strong>Warning: </strong>This product may excite you.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We believe where there is a will, there is a way. From what we have seen, no one has been able to figure out a way to make personal safety a priority. We are here to show you how it's possible and unequivocally conclude it's about that time.</p>
<p>Our will is to safely secure children, the elderly and everyone who values their own or personal safety of others.  While drawing up this project we realized our product is scalable where many people, vulnerable or not, can benefit from immediate and secure access to an emergency device at a moment's notice, reducing the time to acquire assistance even during a struggle. Lockabea is an extension of your parenting, it's for personal safety/communication or acts as a deterrent. Whether you are a child who walks home from school,  a caregiver or a son/daughter taking care of your parents who have dementia or Alzheimer's, or you work late and travel alone, Lockabea is your backup plan.</p>
<p>With the full development of Lockabea, we can save and change many lives around the world with useful technology.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our major challenge for this project is funding. Our team, Design 1st, is ready to take on this project as we get ready to bring Lockabea to you, our customers. We spent 3 ½ years determining the best way, and different ways to build a reliable security system for any individual. Using current technology, we are able to expand Lockabea's versatility to include everyone.</p>
<p>Once we raise $40K in our crowdfunding we will begin the first stage of development in redesigning Lockabea's lockable, tamper resistant band, and watch display for a more conventional look. We are excited and looking forward to get your opinions on designs and colors as we tread along. This is also where we will begin to prepare for the second stage in development, engineering and testing. The first version of Lockabea will be made to hide in plain sight to look like a conventional watch. We will be submitting designs and updates on our progress to our Facebook page and Indiegogo for backers, followers and investors interested in our progress.</p>
<p><strong>There are a few things to know about Lockabea (but not limited to):</strong></p>
<p>SIM card required (not included) - We are looking into a managed service provider to provide you with a SIM card for Lockabea, reducing steps to activate your device and at a lower rate.<br/><br/>911 and SOS emergency activation / Cellular &amp; GPS - Automatic and Manual Alerting</p>
<ul>
<li> 911 emergency button activates a call and sends a message to preset contacts only after 5 minutes (security feature) *ask us why</li>
<li> SOS emergency button gives out the location of the user to preset contacts </li>
<li> Gesture Activation System (GAS) - activated (not default), allows the user to rotate their wrist a specific way and a certain number of times to send alarms or alerts.</li>
<li> 2 security keys are included with each device.</li>
<li>Geo-tracking</li>
<li>GPS</li>
<li>SIM Card activated (not included, at this time)</li>
<li>Text messaging to Lockabea from parents phone via Lockabea app.</li>
<li>Cellular phone app to communicate securely with Lockabea and to change/set features</li>

The Impact

We believe where there is a will, there is a way. From what we have seen, no one has been able to figure out a way to make personal safety a priority. We are here to show you how it's possible and unequivocally conclude it's about that time.
Our will is to safely secure children, the elderly and everyone who values their own or personal safety of others.  While drawing up this project we realized our product is scalable where many people, vulnerable or not, can benefit from immediate and secure access to an emergency device at a moment's notice, reducing the time to acquire assistance even during a struggle. Lockabea is an extension of your parenting, it's for personal safety/communication or acts as a deterrent. Whether you are a child who walks home from school,  a caregiver or a son/daughter taking care of your parents who have dementia or Alzheimer's, or you work late and travel alone, Lockabea is your backup plan.
With the full development of Lockabea, we can save and change many lives around the world with useful technology.

Risks & Challenges
Our major challenge for this project is funding. Our team, Design 1st, is ready to take on this project as we get ready to bring Lockabea to you, our customers. We spent 3 ½ years determining the best way, and different ways to build a reliable security system for any individual. Using current technology, we are able to expand Lockabea's versatility to include everyone.
Once we raise $40K in our crowdfunding we will begin the first stage of development in redesigning Lockabea's lockable, tamper resistant band, and watch display for a more conventional look. We are excited and looking forward to get your opinions on designs and colors as we tread along. This is also where we will begin to prepare for the second stage in development, engineering and testing. The first version of Lockabea will be made to hide in plain sight to look like a conventional watch. We will be submitting designs and updates on our progress to our Facebook page and Indiegogo for backers, followers and investors interested in our progress.
There are a few things to know about Lockabea (but not limited to):

abuse is a traumatic stressor that can rock a person to
the core of their being. Unfortunately, the stigma, shame and social
isolation associated with being a victim of domestic abuse tends
to add to the trauma of the experience. Stigma and shame often lead individuals
to experience deep concerns about what will happen when they reach out for
help.</p><p>Ultimately, an
individual must weigh the benefits of receiving support against the perceived
costs, and the perceived risks currently present a
significant barrier to seeking help. Feelings of shame also decrease
self-worth, which further compound the difficulty of asking for help
as individuals may not see themselves as worthy of help. As a result, there is currently a significant
disconnect between individuals who are experiencing abuse, and the people and
resources that might otherwise be of assistance to them.</p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1358250/files/20150405234812-shut_up.png?1428302892"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>""Isolation, shame and stigma go hand-in-hand with the experience of abuse, and unfortunately often deter individuals from reaching out and exploring their options for staying safe. Many victims of abuse simply don't know where to turn, and lack a safe place to talk about what they are experiencing.""</b></p><p></p><p>The
Empower App aims to increase awareness that individuals are not alone in their
struggles, and that they are not to blame, such that they will feel more
confident to access support services. The current disconnect between
existing resources and those who are experiencing abuse, suggests a need for a discreet, highly-accessible and compassionate support system. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Empower App aims

</ul>
<p>The
Empower App builds upon individuals’ inner strengths and wisdom, and enables users
to communicate with each other in a mutually helpful way, in hopes that they
may gain the confidence to make positive changes in their lives. These
conversations and validation of abuse experiences can be powerful in ameliorating
the disempowering effects of domestic violence, and may empower them to take
positive action for their future safety. </p>
<p>The Empower App provides a discrete access-point for individuals to find support at <i>all stages</i> in their journey of healing after experiencing domestic abuse. The
development of insight and resolution is a process that takes time. Conveniently,
as individuals experience increased social support, and eventually gain the
confidence to reach out to other resources, the Empower App is ready with
connections to key resources within the individual’s community. And when individuals’
are even further along in their healing process, the Empower App’s
story-sharing feature provides a place to reflect upon and identify the
underlying meaning within their experience, while lending inspiration to others
who are still in the grips of an abusive relationship. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1358235/files/20150405233527-screenshots_pic.png?1428302127"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Empower App offers users discreet and safe access to a wealth of information, innovative tools, connections to resources, and a safe place to talk about experiences free from judgement.</p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">Security Features</b></p><p></p><ul>

</div></div>","""A project that began in 2013, the Empower App was inspired by an overwhelming need to bridge the gap between those who are experiencing domestic abuse, and resources that exist within our communities."" - Lindsay Redman, Provisional Registered PsychologistDomestic
abuse is a traumatic stressor that can rock a person to
the core of their being. Unfortunately, the stigma, shame and social
isolation associated with being a victim of domestic abuse tends
to add to the trauma of the experience. Stigma and shame often lead individuals
to experience deep concerns about what will happen when they reach out for
help.Ultimately, an
individual must weigh the benefits of receiving support against the perceived
costs, and the perceived risks currently present a
significant barrier to seeking help. Feelings of shame also decrease
self-worth, which further compound the difficulty of asking for help
as individuals may not see themselves as worthy of help. As a result, there is currently a significant
disconnect between individuals who are experiencing abuse, and the people and
resources that might otherwise be of assistance to them.""Isolation, shame and stigma go hand-in-hand with the experience of abuse, and unfortunately often deter individuals from reaching out and exploring their options for staying safe. Many victims of abuse simply don't know where to turn, and lack a safe place to talk about what they are experiencing.""The
Empower App aims to increase awareness that individuals are not alone in their
struggles, and that they are not to blame, such that they will feel more
confident to access support services. The current disconnect between
existing resources and those who are experiencing abuse, suggests a need for a discreet, highly-accessible and compassionate support system. The Empower App aims
to strengthen individuals’ connections to a community of
support, and challenge the perceptions of stigma and shame associated with
experiencing abuse, to ultimately increase confidence in seeking help. The Empower App will achieve this by
providing safe, discreet access to:

key information about abuse


an
anonymous forum


an interactive relationship check-in to build insights over time


a
connection to local resources


self-care and safety-planning tools


an opportunity to share personal stories and receive validation of these
experiences.


The
Empower App builds upon individuals’ inner strengths and wisdom, and enables users
to communicate with each other in a mutually helpful way, in hopes that they
may gain the confidence to make positive changes in their lives. These
conversations and validation of abuse experiences can be powerful in ameliorating
the disempowering effects of domestic violence, and may empower them to take
positive action for their future safety. 
The Empower App provides a discrete access-point for individuals to find support at all stages in their journey of healing after experiencing domestic abuse. The
development of insight and resolution is a process that takes time. Conveniently,
as individuals experience increased social support, and eventually gain the
confidence to reach out to other resources, the Empower App is ready with
connections to key resources within the individual’s community. And when individuals’
are even further along in their healing process, the Empower App’s
story-sharing feature provides a place to reflect upon and identify the
underlying meaning within their experience, while lending inspiration to others
who are still in the grips of an abusive relationship. The Empower App offers users discreet and safe access to a wealth of information, innovative tools, connections to resources, and a safe place to talk about experiences free from judgement.Security Features

The Empower App will be disguised on the user’s phone as a game application


A panic button allows users to quickly log out at any moment


Log-in requires a personal username and password

Information and resources accessed within the Empower App will not be visible in the user’s browser history

Ghostick is a mobile device accessory that allows you to use your device hands free. Our current primary focus is on producing
protective cases for smartphones and tablets, namely through our flagship
product, The Ghostick.  The Ghostick
delivers all of the protective qualities that the market leading cases do, but
also delivers something that they don’t – added functionality.  While current solutions only protect devices,
ours is made with a unique and patented suction cup insert that allows for full
hands-free use of a tablet or smartphone. Your device and its camera’s full potential and functionality are
unlocked with the Ghostick Case.

  

Designs Ready for Production:
iPhone:  6/6S - 6+/6S+ - 7/7S - 7plus/7S+



                    

Why Ghostick Needs You?




With your support on this campaign we will be able to recommence production, start manufacturing the newer phone models listed above and expand our product into the tablet world. e.g. iPad/iPad Mini-Surface-Samsung 




Your support will also allow us to finalize our designs and fulfill our inventory. Finally, making it possible to get this product in your hands. With manufacturing in place we anticipate having this product ready to ship in 6 months. 



Utility Patent # US 9,124,350 B2 



We are overwhelmed with the enormous amount of people who love this product. The Ghostick Case is in high demand for the newer models and with your help and support we will be able to accomplish this goal and make The Ghostick Case available to everyone.  





Emails We Receive Daily: 
Dear Ghostick, 
My name is Shelby Nunn and Iv'e had your Ghostick case since you first released it. I just upgraded my phone to the 6+ and can't live without my Ghostick Case. Please, please, please let me know when the new case comes out for the iPhone 6+ so I can buy it ASAP.  
P.S. I think you should send Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian one of your cases. They constantly have trouble putting their phone places when taking video for their app and Ghostick would solve all their problems! :)
Your Biggest Fan, 
Shelby Nunn

                    


Ghostick At A Glance
The full
Ghostick Case is comprised of two components. The first is the outer shell, which serves as
the protective element of the case. The
second is the suction cup insert, which contains multiple suction points and
fits firmly inside the outer shell – providing that valuable added
functionality. Suction cup inserts can
be removed easily when needed and quickly switched out for other colors.
