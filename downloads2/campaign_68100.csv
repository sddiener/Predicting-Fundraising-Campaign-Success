<h3><strong>A Little About Me</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>My name is Courtney Cook, and I'm a high schooler from Chicago, IL. I'm a poet, artist, cacti-lover, and Harry Potter fanatic. Around this time last year I stumbled across a feminist blog on tumblr, and was instantly enamored. I felt like my eyes had been opened to an entire world I never knew existed. Since that time I have been in a constant whirlwind of researching any prevalent feminist political issues, reading feminist literature to teach myself, and participating in any feminist cause I can. Becoming an active feminist has allowed me to become more politically and socially aware, as well as allowed me to give back to my community by educating myself and those around me. Because of this new found passion, I would love to go to Feminist Camp!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is Feminism?</h3>
<p>I'm glad you asked! Feminism is the social justice movement concerning the equality of both sexes. Contrary to it's name, as many people believe, feminism is about women and men being <strong>equal</strong>, not about raising women above men. The feminist movement rallies for equal pay, work opportunity, safety, sexual freedom, and so much more. In short, feminism wants to eliminate things such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Other-Double-Standards-Every-Should/dp/1580052452"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">double standards</a>, <a href=""http://jezebel.com/Gender-wage-gap/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the wage gap</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rape culture</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is <a href=""http://www.soapboxinc.com/feminist-bootcamp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feminist Camp?</a></strong></h3>
<p>Feminist Camp is a camp hosted anually in New York City for rising feminists and those interested in feminist causes. Over the course of a week, peers will come together to attend workshops from feminist organizations and companies such as Bust Magazine, UNICEF, Girls Write Now, Planned Parenthood, and others in order to <strong>turn feminist theory into practice. </strong>Each day is themed, such as <span>Reproductive Justice, Sexual Power, Feminist Art, and Philanthropy, as to give a rounded view of some of the many aspects of feminism. At the end of the week, a career day is held to show what careers help out the feminist cause. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>I am asking for 750 dollars, or half of the total cost to attend camp. These funds will go towards housing, breakfast and most lunches for the week, all programming, and a weekly Metro Card. Additionally, I will be using the money for the lunches and dinners that are not included in the original price to attend camp. If I do not reach my full goal, all funds raised will be used to help me get there any ways. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I do not think I can stress enough how pivotal camp would be for me. Most, if not all, of my knowledge on Feminism has stemmed from my own research, and I am dying to be given the opportunity to learn more. I am so enthusiastic about hearing those in the professional feminist world speak about their experiences and gain a further knowledge on the causes they are rooting for. I am looking to go into Feminism and Gender Studies in college, and I think this experience will absolutely solidify that for me. The impact it will have on my heart will be great as well, because I know being surrounded by people who share the same interests with the same fervor as I will provide me with friends for a life time. I believe I can bring all I learn from Feminist Camp back to my home town and share my knowledge in my school, with my friends, and in my workplace, in order to educate those who haven't even heard of Feminism, or even think it's dead! </p>

<p>By analyzing the samples collected in a rape kit, forensic scientists can develop a DNA profile that is unique to the perpetrator. That DNA profile can then be compared to a database with thousands of other DNA profiles from known offenders and from unsolved crime scenes. This process can both identify an unknown perpetrator and link a suspect to other crimes. </p>
<p>To accomplish these things, however, rape kits must be tested. Because research suggests that rapists often commit more than one violent sexual assault and multiple violent crimes; it is important to also test DNA samples of prisoners who are already incarcerated for violent crimes. There is a huge backlog of processing these prisoner sample kits as well. </p>
<p>In the United States, it is estimated that there are hundreds of thousands of untested kits in police and crime lab storage facilities. Each kit represents a survivor who courageously submitted to the four to six-hour rape kit collection process and reported the rape to the police. Many of these survivors never receive any follow-up information after filing the police report. </p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We assembled a team of committed scientists and technicians who will deliver results on time within a fraction of the cost of government labs and in accordance with FBI Laboratory’s guidelines, by using the latest technology to produce more accurate results. New equipment from Thermo Fischer can process multiplex samples and this has been generously offered to us at reduced cost. Thermo Fischer also offered to waive validation services, tech support services, and fees specifically for this project. Their machine is uniquely designed for rapid Human ID protocol. In addition to this partnership, we forged an alliance with lab robot startup Opentron. Using high throughput protocol provided by Opentron’s liquid handling robot, we will greatly reduce handling time, labor costs, and produce more accurate results (up to ~390 tests / hour). After the DNA is fingerprinted, we will sequence our genetic data and provide results to Law Enforcement through encrypted blockchain DNA file sharing provided by our partner Encrypgen.</p>
<h2>The Phases of Impact</h2>
<p>CerTek Bio will utilize state of the art automation to help reduce backlogs of rape kits in the US. As we grow, we will then tackle many other areas of DNA testing that is backlogged. </p>
<p>Out process can also be used to help end the backlog of CODIS, (Combined DNA Index System) the generic term used to describe the FBI's program of support for criminal justice DNA databases. According to this PBS article, (<a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/dna-databases/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/dna-data...</a> ), “The only thing that’s limiting the expansion of DNA databases is the fact that samples often come in faster than labs can analyze them. That’s produced enormous backlogs. To address the problem, the federal government has given $151 million annually to state and local governments since 2005 to process DNA samples. That assistance has been extended through 2014. But even that funding hasn’t let labs catch up.”</p>
<p>We can process these violent prisoner DNA sample kits and offer objective DNA retesting as part of the Innocence Project. We hope to ultimately offer our services at cost to process global samples. Globally there are an excess of 87,000 rape cases per year. As we go further, we will offer our DNA forensics testing service to the Innocence Project (<a href=""https://www.innocenceproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.innocenceproject.org/</a>). The Innocence Project, founded in 1992 by Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck at Cardozo School of Law, exonerates the wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice</p>

</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>Some of the kits are not high quality DNA samples. Over time the kits may have degraded below detection, or there could have been issues with collecting the samples themselves. There will be times when our processing is not going to work, due to this poor quality. There could be times when the DNA we successfully process is not found in the DNA database. Innovations from ThermoFisher will allow us to perform simultaneous automated pre-screening of 96 samples at a time to determine if the sample contains Male DNA in significant enough quantities to perform analysis. Another challenge is DNA samples containing more than one contributor.</p>
<p>These challenges are not an excuse from processing backlog kits at all.  With our scientists and CSI experts, the processing of viable kits can happen at a much faster rate by identifying select high quality samples to perform full analysis on. These high quality samples are much more likely to achieve successful database matching and convection rate in court.</p>

interested and concerned by what I saw happening in the villages of rural
Palestine. 'Area C'  compromises 61% of the land in the West Bank, but
only 6% of the population, and is governed completely by the Israeli Military.

Villagers face housing demolitions, land confiscation, random arrests, flying
checkpoints and other movement restrictions, and assault. The International
Women's Peace Service works in Deir Istiya, one of the villages that has faced
all of these difficulties, due to its proximity to the Ariel Settlement Block.
The IWPS seeks to address these abuses by accompanying farmers working in
dangerous areas, supporting nonviolent protests, documenting human rights

 Grassroots ActionWe are using Indiegogo as a platform to help our supporters be a part of the change.  This allows us to raise funds for our goal and assemble a team of devoted advocates at the same time.When you donate to our campaign, we'll keep you up to date on all of World Mercury Project's progress.  We will also give you links to articles, studies, and content you can share with your friends, family, elected officials, and local media to help fight for change. We have several levels of support for the campaign.  Make a tax-deductible donation today! Click to learn more about our team!Our Vision A world where mercury is no longer a threat to the health of our planet and people.Our Mission We will work aggressively to reduce exposure to all sources of mercury, hold those accountable who failed to protect our planet and people from unnecessary exposure, restore health to those who have been harmed, and make sure this tragedy never happens again. FAQsHow much of the raise will go towards the cause?Indiegogo and credit card processors charge a small percentage of donation transactions.  Apart from these service charges, fully 100% of the campaign raise will go towards our efforts to eliminate mercury from medical products. How do I get a tax-deductible receipt?As the World Mercury Project is a 501(c)(3) Charitable Organization, your donations are tax-deductible.  When you make a contribution, you will receive an email confirmation of your donation from Indiegogo.  Tax receipts will be provided to all backers by the World Mercury Project financial team after the completion of the campaign. Why doesn't Indiegogo list your campaign listed as a Verified Nonprofit?Indiegogo automatically adds a ""verified nonprofit"" banner to the top of campaigns that register through their nonprofit funding processor, FirstGiving.  However, Indiegogo is moving to a new payment processor on March 1st, right in the middle of our campaign.  If we had registered with FirstGiving, our campaign would have to end as soon as their partnership ended.While we don't have the ""verified nonprofit"" banner for this reason, since World Mercury Project is a registered 501(c)(3) Charitable Organization, donations are still tax-deductible - see the FAQ above. If celebrities and major donors are already supporting, why should I help?All of our budget is not covered by major donors. World Mercury Project depends on the generous donations from everyone interested in stopping the use of mercury in all medical products and vaccines. I have more questions.  Whom do I ask?We'll be happy to answer any questions you have about our campaign.  You can reach us at indiegogo@worldmercuryproject.org   Citations1: ADHD / Autism / Alzheimer's / Heart Disease2: Black, Simon.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For so long, most media networks have portrayed Haiti as one of the poorest countries in the Western hemisphere. They think the best way to help is to bring everything to the Haitian people (Food, clothes, etc) leave them with no creativity or adequate education to be self sufficient. After more than 25 years no real changes have taken place there. After thinking about other approaches and strategies, we realized it will be better if we help create and establish a mentality of self sufficiency through a massive education; while trying to convince investors, tourists and corporations to come to invest in Haiti by giving them a unique investment opportunity and showing them the potentials of this country.</p>
<p>HAITI TOURISM Inc. is a US based corporation of young Haitian students and professionals. It was founded by the “Our Voice Achievers Award” nominated, Davidson Toussaint December 28, 2011.

The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of Haiti's tourism and Haiti’s economy.

Help Seattle-area activists travel to this incredible conference by donating today!
   What We Need There's no free lunch under capitalism and we need our community to help make the conference financially accessible to all.


$50 helps offset the cost of shared lodging for the weekend
$100 pays the cost of registration
$500 pays the cost of a single airline ticket 


No donation is too big or too small! We are grateful for any amount you are able to donate.
    The Impact
 The more we raise the more folks we can help with travel expenses. We want as many people involved in the debates, discussions, and workshops that are going to help build our movements. From Black Lives Matter to abortion access to the struggle against standardized testing and so much more, we have so much to learn from each other and the history of our struggles. Help bring those lessons back to Seattle!
    Please help spread the word!
If you aren't able to donate today we would shower you with high fives for passing our campaign along to other folks in your community!

Ask friends, family members, co-workers, and other activists to support our campaign.
Use the sharing tools to promote our cause on social media. You rock!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<li>Your $10 donation allows you to drop one heavy sandbag in front of Trump's property. Together we are going to make a BIG statement. With every donation you will have access to <a href=""https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1t0mc4rzbBFUXdnWnhFWWJXVjQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this invoice,</a> which we recommend you mail to the attention of Donald Trump for reimbursement. </li>
<li>Your $50 gives you a chance to speak out. Take this opportunity to send a message to Trump. We will embed a Youtube video of your choosing on our webpage (in addition to delivering a sandbag for you). </li>
<li>We need to raise $60,000. We've been quoted $30,000 for the delivery of 10,000 25 lb sandbags from Sandbags LLC - a national sandbag supplier, who has a distribution center 45 minutes from Central Park in New Jersey. Additionally, it will cost $15,000 to remove the sandbags. The remaining $15,000 will go to purchasing event permits from the Central Park Authorities, hiring security, and insurance. Anything in excess will be donated to the ""I Have a Dream"" Foundation. </li>
<li>The more money we raise, the bigger this wall can be. The economies of scale work such that our removal fees increase only slightly with every 5,000 sandbags purchased. This means more funds for our friends at The Foundation.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal - every dollar raised will go to the ""I Have a Dream"" Foundation. </li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've been working tirelessly since April to make this a reality. We've met with various authorities to ensure everything checks out. Citywide Special Events has been incredibly helpful in coordinate the logistics. We are still working out the details of the final location. As you can imagine, dropping 250,000 pounds of sand anywhere in NYC can congest traffic, especially in Central Park. Our first preference for the event is on the edge of Central Park at W59th St and Ave of Americas. Our second choice is Central Park West and W 59th ST, in front of Trump International. Our backup location is 72nd St Traverse and Terrace Drive. We will settle on the exact location in mid-August.</p>
<p><strong>You can trust us to deliver. </strong>We are four super dedicated and disciplined individuals, with a vision for something big. Collectively, our team consists of professional designers, event organizers, mechanical engineers, and crazy party throwers.

<p><strong>Hey Everyone! Thank you so much for your donations.  We are still raising legal funds for the Cleveland four! Their pre-sentencing hearings are scheduled for November 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>. During these hearings the four will be presenting evidence for entrapment and arguing against the Terrorism Enhancement Charge. Every penny that is raised from now until November will go towards preparing for these hearings.  The money we are raising is not going towards a greedy lawyer’s salary. Arguing a case of this magnitude requires hiring specialists and investigators who do not do pro-bono work. There are also fees associated and equipment costs. Originally (when we were going to trial) we were trying to raise $50,000, now we are trying to raise $10,000 in the next 6 days. We have already raised $2,000 please help us reach our goal by spreading the word to your friends and family!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I’m Susanna and I am part of the Cleveland 4 Justice Support Committee. We are a group of friends, family members and concerned citizens who are raising awareness, doing legal support, and prison support for 4 guys who were arrested in Cleveland, OH on May 1, 2012. With this campaign we are raising $50,000 for our legal defense team for the Cleveland 4. It is vital for these 4 guys to have the best legal representation they can get because of the magnitude of what not only they are facing, but what the outcome of this case could mean for future organizing groups and activists in this country.</p>
<p><strong>Larger Summary:</strong></p>
<p>The Cleveland 4: Doug L. Wright, Brandon Baxter, Connor Stevens, and Joshua Stafford were arrested on May 1, 2012 after allegedly attempting to blow up a bridge outside of Cleveland,OH.. What you have to understand is that it was the FBI who came up with the plan, who got the supplies for carrying it out, and who coerced these four into coming along. This is not a conspiracy, it’s called FBI entrapment.</p>
<p>The FBI, was sent into Occupy Movements across the country to disrupt and discredit Occupy in the eye of the American People. In Cleveland, they sent in an informant to identify individuals they deemed to be “fringe”, who could be easily isolated and coerced to do something they would have never dreamed of without the help of the FBI. This FBI informant befriended a few of these guys and began to earn their trust by employing them and giving them endless amounts of drugs, alcohol and pharmaceuticals. Over the course of 6 months, this informant slowly isolated them from friends and family by keeping them working all day long, and never letting their supply of drugs and alcohol run out. These guys were further worn down by often staffing the night shift at the Occupy Cleveland tent. During these six months, the FBI informant started instigating conversations with the guys about doing violent actions. Many of these conversations were recorded, and are featured in the affidavit as evidence against the four. But what has been put forth is clearly taken out of context and is being used as a smear campaign to paint these four guys as violent anarchist terrorists. Furthermore, the FBI informant told the guys he could get C-4 and then supplied the $ to buy it.  These guys weren’t looking for explosives, and would have never had money or the incentive to buy them. This scenario was completely masterminded by the FBI and made possible with their $ and supplies.</p>
<p>But why would the FBI want to create terrorists you ask?</p>
<p>If you look at the history of activist movements in the US you will find a track record of FBI involvement. From the red scare, to co-intelpro – where the FBI infiltrated the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement and the Black liberation movements of the 60’s and 70’s, to the Green Scare—where FBI targeted environmental and animal rights groups, to again the anti-war movements and anti-capitalist movements of the 90’s and 2000’s and now the Occupy Wallstreet movement.</p>
<p>But why the Occupy wallstreet movement?</p>
<p>Occupy Wallstreet is a movement for economic justice in the US. It appeals to the 99% of people living in this country who own 1% of the wealth. Occupy Wallstreet began as a protest against the government bailing out banks and multi-million dollar corporations after the finacial crisis of 2008. Occupy Wallstreet asked the question “why are we bailing out these corporations who are using the $ for CEO bonuses instead of bailing out the American people who are losing their homes and jobs across the country”. This question resonated with the majority of people in America. Well, corporations didn’t like that, they wanted business as usual. So the FBI was sent in to the Occupy Movement to disrupt, discredit and destroy it from the inside out. And how do they do this? They link occupy with actions and words that already have a negative connotation amongst the American People, like: weapons of mass destruction, terrorists, and anarchists—they even wanted the Cleveland 4 trial to start on Sept. 11th! With the help of the media, this entrapment is working. After a showy FBI press conference, newspapers eagerly printed sensational headlines about anarchist terrorist cells plotting a string of bombings.</p>
<p>The city evicted Occupy Cleveland from their downtown encampment, the group canceled their Mayday actions, and they officially turned their backs on the four, issuing a face-saving statement distancing themselves from these dedicated members of the movement. In one move, the FBI refocused our attention at Occupy away from social change and the collective survival of the 99%, to pointless debates about tactics the FBI invented in the first place.</p>
<p>But we are not going to be silenced on this unjust entrapment!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>That is why we are building the best legal defense we can for these guys. We have hired a lawyer Terry Gilbert who is a well known civil rights attorney. Along with Terry, we need to hire an investigative team who can sift through the 70 plus hours of recordings and evidence.

Hey Everyone! Thank you so much for your donations.  We are still raising legal funds for the Cleveland four! Their pre-sentencing hearings are scheduled for November 5th and 6th. During these hearings the four will be presenting evidence for entrapment and arguing against the Terrorism Enhancement Charge. Every penny that is raised from now until November will go towards preparing for these hearings.  The money we are raising is not going towards a greedy lawyer’s salary. Arguing a case of this magnitude requires hiring specialists and investigators who do not do pro-bono work. There are also fees associated and equipment costs. Originally (when we were going to trial) we were trying to raise $50,000, now we are trying to raise $10,000 in the next 6 days. We have already raised $2,000 please help us reach our goal by spreading the word to your friends and family!
Short Summary
Hello, I’m Susanna and I am part of the Cleveland 4 Justice Support Committee. We are a group of friends, family members and concerned citizens who are raising awareness, doing legal support, and prison support for 4 guys who were arrested in Cleveland, OH on May 1, 2012. With this campaign we are raising $50,000 for our legal defense team for the Cleveland 4. It is vital for these 4 guys to have the best legal representation they can get because of the magnitude of what not only they are facing, but what the outcome of this case could mean for future organizing groups and activists in this country.
Larger Summary:
The Cleveland 4: Doug L. Wright, Brandon Baxter, Connor Stevens, and Joshua Stafford were arrested on May 1, 2012 after allegedly attempting to blow up a bridge outside of Cleveland,OH.. What you have to understand is that it was the FBI who came up with the plan, who got the supplies for carrying it out, and who coerced these four into coming along. This is not a conspiracy, it’s called FBI entrapment.
The FBI, was sent into Occupy Movements across the country to disrupt and discredit Occupy in the eye of the American People. In Cleveland, they sent in an informant to identify individuals they deemed to be “fringe”, who could be easily isolated and coerced to do something they would have never dreamed of without the help of the FBI. This FBI informant befriended a few of these guys and began to earn their trust by employing them and giving them endless amounts of drugs, alcohol and pharmaceuticals. Over the course of 6 months, this informant slowly isolated them from friends and family by keeping them working all day long, and never letting their supply of drugs and alcohol run out. These guys were further worn down by often staffing the night shift at the Occupy Cleveland tent. During these six months, the FBI informant started instigating conversations with the guys about doing violent actions. Many of these conversations were recorded, and are featured in the affidavit as evidence against the four. But what has been put forth is clearly taken out of context and is being used as a smear campaign to paint these four guys as violent anarchist terrorists. Furthermore, the FBI informant told the guys he could get C-4 and then supplied the $ to buy it.  These guys weren’t looking for explosives, and would have never had money or the incentive to buy them. This scenario was completely masterminded by the FBI and made possible with their $ and supplies.
But why would the FBI want to create terrorists you ask?
If you look at the history of activist movements in the US you will find a track record of FBI involvement. From the red scare, to co-intelpro – where the FBI infiltrated the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement and the Black liberation movements of the 60’s and 70’s, to the Green Scare—where FBI targeted environmental and animal rights groups, to again the anti-war movements and anti-capitalist movements of the 90’s and 2000’s and now the Occupy Wallstreet movement.
But why the Occupy wallstreet movement?
Occupy Wallstreet is a movement for economic justice in the US. It appeals to the 99% of people living in this country who own 1% of the wealth. Occupy Wallstreet began as a protest against the government bailing out banks and multi-million dollar corporations after the finacial crisis of 2008. Occupy Wallstreet asked the question “why are we bailing out these corporations who are using the $ for CEO bonuses instead of bailing out the American people who are losing their homes and jobs across the country”. This question resonated with the majority of people in America. Well, corporations didn’t like that, they wanted business as usual. So the FBI was sent in to the Occupy Movement to disrupt, discredit and destroy it from the inside out. And how do they do this? They link occupy with actions and words that already have a negative connotation amongst the American People, like: weapons of mass destruction, terrorists, and anarchists—they even wanted the Cleveland 4 trial to start on Sept. 11th! With the help of the media, this entrapment is working. After a showy FBI press conference, newspapers eagerly printed sensational headlines about anarchist terrorist cells plotting a string of bombings.
The city evicted Occupy Cleveland from their downtown encampment, the group canceled their Mayday actions, and they officially turned their backs on the four, issuing a face-saving statement distancing themselves from these dedicated members of the movement. In one move, the FBI refocused our attention at Occupy away from social change and the collective survival of the 99%, to pointless debates about tactics the FBI invented in the first place.
But we are not going to be silenced on this unjust entrapment!
What We Need 
That is why we are building the best legal defense we can for these guys. We have hired a lawyer Terry Gilbert who is a well known civil rights attorney. Along with Terry, we need to hire an investigative team who can sift through the 70 plus hours of recordings and evidence. We need to hire specialists to use during the trial who can testify to the authenticity of the recordings and other evidence being used against the five. All of these things, plus the cost of the trial and court fees etc. amount to a huge bill. We need this money in such a short time because this trial is being fast tracked by the FBI so that the defense has as little resources and support as they can get. We have already put our own savings on the line to secure the defense. Please help us with as much contribution as you can give. All money raised will go directly to the Cleveland 4 Legal fund.
In the next 30 days, we hope to raise at least $50,000! The trial date is set for September 18th that gives us only 6 weeks to prepare!
Although this is a joint defense, all money collected for the Cleveland 4 Legal Defense fund will go solely to Connor Stevens’ legal representation. Doug L. Wright, Brandon Baxter and Joshua Stafford have court appointed attorneys with independent budgets. 
The Impact
We need to expose the FBI’s unjust tactics during this trial; the evidence is there, it’s just a matter of having the resources to do it. This trial will set a precedent as to whether the FBI can get away with this kind of entrapment in the future, these 4 guys could be any of us.

<h3>Catching Rain 2016<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Project 509 works in Haiti, helping
improve access to clean drinking water in remote mountain villages. Every day,
people (mostly children) walk 2-4 hours round-trip just to bring drinking water
home from streams that are contaminated with a variety of waterborne
disease.<span>  In the villages where we work,
dozens of people die each year from cholera alone.  </span></p>
<p>These communities lack basic sanitation
education, the resources to promote personal hygienic practices, water filtration
technologies or infrastructure, and the ability to combat waterborne disease in
general.<span>  Nor are there any legitimate roads
into the area, so we pack all supplies in on mules … a four-hour trek to the
first village we work in.  </span></p>
<p>In collaboration with local community
leaders, we build durable, efficient, and high volume rain catchment systems,
which dramatically improve access to clean drinking water; we also develop community
based education programs and materials about basic sanitation and hygiene that are
given in schools, churches, and to community groups, and we distribute resources
– including bleach, hand soap, toilet paper and basic water filtration systems
– all critical in combating waterborne diseases like cholera, and promoting
basic sanitation and hygiene.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Access to clean drinking water is the
cornerstone of any healthy community – something we far too often take for
granted.<span>  Unfathomably, cholera was
inadvertently brought into Haiti by the international aid community’s response
to the devastating Earthquake of 2010. For
the past five years, it has been our resolve to counteract this unfortunate
reality … and we need your help to take our work to “the next level.” </span></p>

San Antonio Police Department officers from the West Substation responded to what they claim was an individual waving his rifle around and pointing it at people.  Nothing could be further from the truth. This story is suspect because officer did NOT respond with lights and siren (indicative of an emergency call) nor did they identify themselves as police officers (see video below). <br/><br/>After approaching and recognizing that Henry Vichique wasn't a threat and that the call was a hoax, officers still attempted to disarm a law-abiding citizen walking home from a friend's house. As officers were about to let Henry go about his business and continue his walk home, another officer arrived on scene and decided to elevate the tension by tazing our member. Henry was then arrested for having a loaded firearm within city limits, a local ordinance that directly violates state pre-emption laws pertaining to firearms as contained in Local Government Code 229.001(a)(1), which states: ""a municipality may not adopt regulations relating to...the transfer, private ownership, keeping, transportation, licensing, or registration of firearms, air guns, ammunition, or firearm.""<br/><br/>Mr. Vichique was charged under San Antonio Ordinance Section 21-16, Carrying loaded rifle or shotgun. The ordinance reads, ""It shall be unlawful for any person, other than duly authorized peace officers, to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun on any public street within the city or in a motor vehicle while the same is being operated on any public street within the city.""  Open Carry Texas maintains, and has maintained since this issue was first brought to our attention last year, that this ordinance is unenforceable and void due to the Texas pre-emption laws as stated above.<br/><br/>Open Carry Texas strongly objects to the abuses suffered at the hands of San Antonio Police Department officers against a law-abiding citizen exercising his right to keep and bear arms. Once again, the SAPD has shown that their force lacks in training, experience, common sense, and a basic understanding of Texas law and rights afforded to Texans by virtue of our state and federal constitutions. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, but that seems to be the rule of the day in SAPD. Our rights do not end when the sun goes down.</p><p>Please help us defend Mr. Vichique against these gross violations of his constitutional rights to keep and bear arms as well as personal self defense. Mr. Vichique is 19 years old and newly married trying to begin a life of independence and shouldn't have to worry about his future because of a few rogue police officers. </p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>The money raised here will go towards actual costs associated with Mr. Vicheque's defense other than attorney's fees. San Antonio attorney Joe Hoelscher has graciously offered to donate his time pro bono to defending him, but we need to help with his out of pocket costs. Any money left over in this account no used will be placed in a trust for any future violation of 2nd Amendment rights. 100% of funds collected (other than fees charged by Indiegogo or Paypal) will directly into this fund for future use. No loans or grants will be taken against this account. Donors have the right to demand accountability of where the money is spent at any time after the campaign ends.</p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>It is a state state of affairs that in a state like Texas, we have to fight for our 2nd Amendment and Section 23 (Texas Bill of Rights) right to keep and bear arms. If we fail to hold law enforcement accountable because victims of these violations can't afford to defend themselves, we might as well give up our guns now. Your donations help us in the fight to ensure that Texas doesn't become California, or Connecticut, or Maryland or New York. Your support of Open Carry Texas is support for the Second Amendment.

Henry was then arrested for having a loaded firearm within city limits, a local ordinance that directly violates state pre-emption laws pertaining to firearms as contained in Local Government Code 229.001(a)(1), which states: ""a municipality may not adopt regulations relating to...the transfer, private ownership, keeping, transportation, licensing, or registration of firearms, air guns, ammunition, or firearm.""Mr. Vichique was charged under San Antonio Ordinance Section 21-16, Carrying loaded rifle or shotgun. The ordinance reads, ""It shall be unlawful for any person, other than duly authorized peace officers, to carry a loaded rifle or shotgun on any public street within the city or in a motor vehicle while the same is being operated on any public street within the city.""  Open Carry Texas maintains, and has maintained since this issue was first brought to our attention last year, that this ordinance is unenforceable and void due to the Texas pre-emption laws as stated above.Open Carry Texas strongly objects to the abuses suffered at the hands of San Antonio Police Department officers against a law-abiding citizen exercising his right to keep and bear arms. Once again, the SAPD has shown that their force lacks in training, experience, common sense, and a basic understanding of Texas law and rights afforded to Texans by virtue of our state and federal constitutions. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, but that seems to be the rule of the day in SAPD. Our rights do not end when the sun goes down.Please help us defend Mr. Vichique against these gross violations of his constitutional rights to keep and bear arms as well as personal self defense. Mr. Vichique is 19 years old and newly married trying to begin a life of independence and shouldn't have to worry about his future because of a few rogue police officers. What We Need & What You GetThe money raised here will go towards actual costs associated with Mr. Vicheque's defense other than attorney's fees. San Antonio attorney Joe Hoelscher has graciously offered to donate his time pro bono to defending him, but we need to help with his out of pocket costs. Any money left over in this account no used will be placed in a trust for any future violation of 2nd Amendment rights. 100% of funds collected (other than fees charged by Indiegogo or Paypal) will directly into this fund for future use. No loans or grants will be taken against this account. Donors have the right to demand accountability of where the money is spent at any time after the campaign ends. The ImpactIt is a state state of affairs that in a state like Texas, we have to fight for our 2nd Amendment and Section 23 (Texas Bill of Rights) right to keep and bear arms. If we fail to hold law enforcement accountable because victims of these violations can't afford to defend themselves, we might as well give up our guns now. Your donations help us in the fight to ensure that Texas doesn't become California, or Connecticut, or Maryland or New York. Your support of Open Carry Texas is support for the Second Amendment. When you support us, you're supporting law-abiding gun owners in the Lone Star State.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't afford to donate monetarily, please consider contacting your state representatives and senators and demanding accountability of these encroachments against our right to keep and bear arms.

<p>I am Mac MacDevitt - I am an artist heading up the <a href=""http://www.mylaimemorial.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Lai Memorial Exhibit</a> team for the Chicago Chapter of Veterans For Peace.</p>
<p><strong>Our Indiegogo campaign ended on 11/5, but with the help of more than 100 backers we have raised almost 60% of our campaign goal - enough to ensure that the exhibit will be begin touring in March 2017. Visit us at the <a href=""http://www.mylaimemorial.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Lai Memorial Exhibit</a> for a tour schedule and information on how to host the exhibit in your area. </strong></p>
<p>I came of age during the Vietnam War and avoided being drafted and sent to Vietnam by becoming a teacher, but I have always been haunted by the terrible suffering endured by the Vietnamese people. I began to explore how collaborative art projects can deepen our understanding and empathy. The exhibit allows participants to tap into the artist in each one of us and join together to speak up for social justice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504639984/dk5tdwnffhvad1qupfe5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our campaign to create the My Lai Memorial Exhibit is an extension of the anti-war movement that challenged the military’s narrative about the war. With their fierce and persistent opposition, the Vietnamese people and anti-war activists joined together to help end the war. It is now widely acknowledged that the Vietnam war was unnecessary, unjust and immoral. Yet it is clear that we continue to make the same mistakes in our wars today. Wars that cause death, destruction, and floods of refugees, just like in Vietnam.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we can finish our traveling memorial exhibit to honor the Vietnamese who died in our American War. We expect that thousands of Americans will visit the exhibit over our two-year tour across the country. Through a unique and powerful artistic process developed by VFP members, participants engage in dialogue, make amends for the damage Americans caused the Vietnamese people and renew their commitment to work for peace and social justice in the world now.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise <strong>$27,000</strong> to complete the traveling exhibit and go on tour starting in February 2018. <i>As a nonprofit organization your donation is tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.</i><br/><br/>VFP volunteers are donating their time and energy to develop and travel with the exhibit.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I first started working with sculptural collages as a graduate student in the late 1960’s. When I first saw the photograph in LIFE magazine of women and children being lined up just before they were shot by American soldiers in Vietnam, I felt as if I had been punched in the stomach. I developed my first sculptural collage to deal with these feelings.</p>
<p>At a recent social justice fair, participants explained that their collage spoke of concerns with US foreign policy, the treatment of oppressed people and the need to learn and understand what is really going on behind mainstream narratives. The conversations were heart-felt and intimate. When I sit with others today who create their personal collage and discuss their artwork, I feel hopeful that together, even in this troubling time, we can work towards peace and justice.</p>
<p>The National VFP Convention was hosted in August of this year in Chicago. We set up just a sample of what we have planned for our traveling exhibit. We had a sculptural collage for VFP members to work with, the same one featured in the video. The dialogue with these veteran peace activists confirmed the power of our artistic process. Here are a <a href=""http://mylaimemorial.org/convention-photos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">few examples of their work</a>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504640851/pqb0jrzqyp10rnfd7yb1.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know that the content of the exhibit may be difficult and painful for many participants.</p>
<p>Our exhibit panels on the Vietnam War and the My Lai Massacre examines the tragic impact of our political and military actions on the people of Vietnam; a people who in the midst of the American War were wounded or killed and had their villages, their homes, their livelihood and their social fabric torn apart.</p>
<p>The exhibit explores how our governmental and military policies and practices developed, nurtured, implemented and then covered-up a campaign that led to the killing of 2 million Vietnamese civilians during the course of this war; a campaign that allowed and encouraged the atrocity at My Lai, and other mass killings on the ground and from the air with bombs and artillery shells.</p>
<p>So why is it important to remember the destruction we caused to the Vietnamese people? Our VFP chapter is a member of the <a href=""http://www.sitesofconscience.org/en/home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>International Coalition of Sites of Conscience</strong></u></a>. Coalition members include holocaust museums and sites where atrocities took place. Our Memorial Exhibit reflects the “memory to action” process that guides coalition members,<i>“not only to preserve memories of historical events, but also to understand the context in which these events occurred and apply the lessons we have learned to today’s struggles for human rights and social justice.”</i>  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504708163/qoao8ipgriff61snd46z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We need to continue to make amends for ongoing human and environmental damage we caused in Vietnam. Bomb craters need to be filled. Kids have their hands blown off from unexploded shells. And children born with deformities caused by our use of defoliants like Agent Orange still need care.</p>
<p>To deal with this challenge, we have designed an exhibit that is welcoming, open and non-judgmental. We invite participants to process this difficult content in their own way. And we are there to listen wholeheartedly as people process their personal thoughts and feelings.</p>

I am a former fost/adopt child, one of hundreds of thousands who share a story no one I have ever met knows about. The abuse within our 'justice' system is rampant, the negligence provided within these homes provides illness to the point of death and mental handicap. While not every home is the same, effective results can be seen in the vast majority of children afforded the 'blessing' of this salvation who end up on the streets, on welfare or in jail. Since the day my entire life has been looking forward to has occurred, the date of my 18th birthday which gave me status as a human being, I have been looking into why and how these injustices have been able to occur. They go on because in many ways, what happens to minors is not yet illegal. </p><p></p><p>Freedom under 18 demands freedom and equal rights for the only population of the US still underrepresented. The US Constitution was written at a time when children were considered property, and while amendments have been made for women, blacks, minorities, the disabled, and the elderly, no such amendment has yet been made regarding children. <a href=""http://works.bepress.com/kevin_maillard/6/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://works.bepress.com/kevin_maillard/6/</u></a><br/><br/> Freedom unde<span>r 18 also demands the ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the Child; to take our place amongst the rest of our upstanding international community as a beacon fostering progressive human rights welfare. The US is the only UN member aside from South Sudan and Somalia not to ratify the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which is the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights; civil, cultural, economic, political and social. It also prohibits prosecuting and incarcerating children as adults because their minds are too immature to form ""criminal intent."" <br/><a href=""http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45894&amp;Cr=children&amp;Cr1=rights#.UuCxlhDn_IU"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45894&amp;Cr=children&amp;Cr1=rights#.UuCxlhDn_IU</u></a><br/><br/> Freedom under 18 is built to spread awareness of the widespread abuse within many American households. More specifically it focuses on America's most vulnerable population; those children within the complicated, inefficient, and rampantly abusive foster system.</span></p><p></p><p>With your help, the formation of this alliance will solidify and become a powerhouse for tackling these social injustices through petitions, campaigning for bills, and social awareness!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>To get this nonprofit going, we need $400 for the application of 501(c)3 status. It is the projected cost of the 1020 form user fee. The estimated cost of an advisor to aid with the required  paperwork is $250.

I am a former fost/adopt child, one of hundreds of thousands who share a story no one I have ever met knows about. The abuse within our 'justice' system is rampant, the negligence provided within these homes provides illness to the point of death and mental handicap. While not every home is the same, effective results can be seen in the vast majority of children afforded the 'blessing' of this salvation who end up on the streets, on welfare or in jail. Since the day my entire life has been looking forward to has occurred, the date of my 18th birthday which gave me status as a human being, I have been looking into why and how these injustices have been able to occur. They go on because in many ways, what happens to minors is not yet illegal. Freedom under 18 demands freedom and equal rights for the only population of the US still underrepresented. The US Constitution was written at a time when children were considered property, and while amendments have been made for women, blacks, minorities, the disabled, and the elderly, no such amendment has yet been made regarding children. http://works.bepress.com/kevin_maillard/6/ Freedom under 18 also demands the ratification of the Convention of the Rights of the Child; to take our place amongst the rest of our upstanding international community as a beacon fostering progressive human rights welfare. The US is the only UN member aside from South Sudan and Somalia not to ratify the Convention of the Rights of the Child, which is the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights; civil, cultural, economic, political and social. It also prohibits prosecuting and incarcerating children as adults because their minds are too immature to form ""criminal intent."" http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=45894&Cr=children&Cr1=rights#.UuCxlhDn_IU Freedom under 18 is built to spread awareness of the widespread abuse within many American households. More specifically it focuses on America's most vulnerable population; those children within the complicated, inefficient, and rampantly abusive foster system.With your help, the formation of this alliance will solidify and become a powerhouse for tackling these social injustices through petitions, campaigning for bills, and social awareness!What We Need & What You GetTo get this nonprofit going, we need $400 for the application of 501(c)3 status. It is the projected cost of the 1020 form user fee. The estimated cost of an advisor to aid with the required  paperwork is $250. We are hoping to get this rolling by mid-July. If the goal is not met, the gap will be filled by myself to meet the needs of the nonprofit.

<p> </p>
<p>Our effort has already been effective.  In 2014, during the crisis in Ferguson, Missouri, Fatal Encounters' key contribution was to show that the annual total of police killings was more than <i>three times larger</i> than the official numbers.  For years, the FBI has reported that between 300 and 400 people are killed by police each year. They call each death a ""justifiable"" homicide in their reports. Based on 2013 and 2014 data, we've proven beyond dispute that the number of people who die is closer to 1,700. </p>

<p>The first draft of our database is about 94 percent complete. <strong>We've documented more than 21,800</strong> deaths during police interactions.  At our current rate, we hope to have the draft complete in October 2017.  Our intention for the next phase of Fatal Encounters is to make the data even more useful by including data on whether the person was armed, mentally ill or a veteran. It's also our intention to add data regarding officers killed in the line of duty, so the dataset can be truly comprehensive.</p>

<h2>Where Will the Money Go?</h2>In this campaign, we're trying to raise the money we need to run Fatal Encounters Dot Org for six months. The biggest portion is salary for the executive director, who is also our primary researcher and fact-checker. The rest of the funds will go to operational expenses like per-record researchers, web hosting, and government taxes and fees.  <br/> <h2>FAQ</h2> <p><b>1)  What is Fatal Encounters?</b></p>FatalEncounters.org is a project to create a national database of people killed by law enforcement going back to the year 2000.<br/><br/>We started the project because there is no adequate database for citizens, researchers or law enforcement to track trends in officer-involved homicides across regions or time.  <br/><br/>The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act mandated “the Attorney General shall, through appropriate means, acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers,” and the publication of an annual report.  This requirement has been virtually ignored for 23 years. In 2000, the federal government passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, but it was essentially voluntary, and fewer than half of deaths were reported. In 2014, Congress reauthorized the Death in Custody Reporting Act, but again, it had no teeth.<br/><br/>Collecting data is the first step for analysis of police killings in the United States. The data can then be used to understand and improve the issue.  Our government knows who we call on our cell phones, who we email, and probably even the contents of those calls and emails.  So the idea that our government is unable to record the names of the people it kills, and unable to explain why, is a ridiculous and dangerous idea.  We are proving it wrong.  <br/><br/><b>2)  How do you collect the data?</b><br/><br/>We collect data from news reports, from public records requests directly from police agencies, and from court filings and legal documents.  A small percentage of our data is ""crowdsourced,"" meaning anyone can research and submit information<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">.  </span>
</div><div>
<br/><b>3)  What kind of responses do you get from FOIA requests? </b><br/><br/>We’ve requested data at the federal level and in several states. The responses from law enforcement have covered the gamut, from sending the information without comment or delay, to a delayed response, to answering the request in such a way as to make the information useless, down to outright refusal to obey public records laws, defying us to sue them.  Those refusals are informative in their own way.  <br/> <p><b>4)  If this is crowdsourced, then why do you need money?</b></p>While we allow “the crowd” to submit information, the crowdsourced information is now less than 5 percent of the database. We pay researchers for most of the data. Funding will allow us to finish the project more quickly.  Our current resources put us on pace to finish the first draft of the database in October 2017.  <br/> <p>Fatal Encounters has already had an impact.  When we published our completed data for the years 2013 and 2014 we made a key contribution to the national conversation about police killings.  We proved that the annual total was much bigger—three times bigger—than the widely reported and accepted figures the FBI has been providing for years.  This simple but important breakthrough was driven by our research. </p>The sooner we complete our database, the bigger impact we’ll have on the debate. <br/> <p><b style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>5)  What if you're overfunded?   </b></p>We have other projects we’d like to do, like make many more public records requests, but that line item is pricey and unpredictable. If we by some chance get more funding than we ask for, we’ll apply the overage to extending the life of the project. As things stand—despite hand-wringing and grandstanding—the federal government has not funded a program to collect this information in a comprehensive manner, so it remains up to us to collect the data for the foreseeable future. <br/> <p><b>6)  Do you still take volunteers?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely.  Volunteers will always be at the heart of this effort.  The government has been ignoring the need to comprehensively collect this information for a very long time, and there’s a lot of work to do.  We have volunteers out there, helping with data entry, helping with a redesign of the site, doing visualizations, doing research with the data.</p>
<p><br/><b>7)  What can you tell from the data so far? </b><br/><br/>As an organization, our conviction has been that we will not do data analysis until the first draft of the dataset is complete for the United States going back to 2000. We've enabled news organizations, activists, universities and  law enforcement to do analysis. That said, there's some simple things that can be discerned. </p>
<p>The numbers are far bigger than anybody—even us—anticipated.  When this project started in 2012, we thought we would be collecting data on about 6,000 incidents altogether.  That number is now a projected 24,000.  The higher number makes the work all that much more important.  </p>Statistically, we find that people of color are killed at disproportionately higher rates than their shares of the general population.  Mentally ill people are a high percentage, at least 25-30 percent, of all people killed by police.  Around 94 percent of the people who die by gunshot are men.  And law enforcement in the Western states tend to kill more people per capita than Eastern ones.   Emerging state-to-state comparisons are fascinating. <br/><br/> <p><b>8)  Aren’t you duplicating efforts with the Guardian, the Washington Post, Killed by Police, wikipedia, and other organizations doing the same thing? </b></p>We have had working relationships with all of these projects.  Both the Guardian and the Washington Post used our data to start their own databases.  All these voices are welcome and needed.  <br/><br/>The biggest difference between our effort and theirs is that we’re trying to gather the older data at the same time as we collect data moving forward. The older data is needed so that everyone can draw meaningful conclusions by comparing regions and deaths over time. Another huge difference is we're counting all types of deaths through police encounters. For example, the Washington Post only counts gun deaths. Fatal Encounters also counts deaths through use of stun guns, in police chases, choking deaths—whenever a police officer is present.<br/> <p>The scope, depth, discipline, potential, and open-source philosophy of Fatal Encounters remains unique.  In an May 1, 2015, front-page story the New York Times described Fatal Encounters as “the most meticulous” of all similar projects.  Media organizations around the world are using our data.  And we’re in it for the long haul.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502418305/mbc25fradjdo26okyage.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p> <b>9)  How does this actually help people?  </b><br/><br/>There are lots of answers to that question.  They fall into three basic ideas.<br/> <p><b>Simple visibility.</b>  You cannot solve a problem until you know the size and shape of the problem.  This issue is greater and more urgent than we ever suspected.  People must know the risks of encountering police and watch their behavior around police.  This knowledge alone can save lives.  </p>Gathering data is the only way to <b>understand the underlying reality</b> about police killings.  Researchers have uncovered correlations between police killings and victims’ characteristics, geography, and how those police forces are funded and trained and managed.  Popular opinion may consider young black men to be the most vulnerable population, and that may be true, but the data shows that other groups are at risk too.  Native Americans. The deaf.  The mentally ill.  The suicidal.  Motorcyclists.  Veterans.  Policemen’s spouses. <br/><br/>And <b>accountability</b>.  Today some police departments laugh out loud at the idea that they are responsible to the public in any way.  They operate in secret.  Our current statistics show that officers who have killed on duty, whatever the circumstances, face criminal charges in less than 1 percent of deaths.  Police often appear immune to criminal indictment, let alone conviction.  So the families of victims seek justice with their only legal recourse, civil suits.  When they're successful, civil suits can award millions to survivors, burden taxpayers, and have absolutely no effect on how police operate.  There is no working feedback loop to decrease fatal police violence.  Laying groundwork towards effective police accountability is another important use for the data we gather.    <br/> <p>With a successful crowdfunding campaign, we can make this problem visible in a way that can’t be denied.  We’ll be able to help identify best practices to support positive change.  When the best policies are in place, we’ll have fewer police killed by criminals and fewer individuals killed by police, which is the whole purpose of this project.</p>

We've documented more than 21,800 deaths during police interactions.  At our current rate, we hope to have the draft complete in October 2017.  Our intention for the next phase of Fatal Encounters is to make the data even more useful by including data on whether the person was armed, mentally ill or a veteran. It's also our intention to add data regarding officers killed in the line of duty, so the dataset can be truly comprehensive.
Please help us push this conversation forward. Tell your friends. Share it on social media. Tell your co-workers.  We’re a 501(c)3 so donations can be tax-deductible. While we are a nonprofit, this fundraising campaign is not using  Indiegogo's nonprofit platform for logistical reasons. Particularly for larger donations, if you would like your donation to be tax-deductible, donate directly to Fatal Encounters Dot Org. You'll get all the perks that we've described here, it just won't change the total on this page. You can make a difference. 
 

 

Where Will the Money Go?In this campaign, we're trying to raise the money we need to run Fatal Encounters Dot Org for six months. The biggest portion is salary for the executive director, who is also our primary researcher and fact-checker. The rest of the funds will go to operational expenses like per-record researchers, web hosting, and government taxes and fees.   FAQ 1)  What is Fatal Encounters?FatalEncounters.org is a project to create a national database of people killed by law enforcement going back to the year 2000.We started the project because there is no adequate database for citizens, researchers or law enforcement to track trends in officer-involved homicides across regions or time.  The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act mandated “the Attorney General shall, through appropriate means, acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers,” and the publication of an annual report.  This requirement has been virtually ignored for 23 years. In 2000, the federal government passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, but it was essentially voluntary, and fewer than half of deaths were reported. In 2014, Congress reauthorized the Death in Custody Reporting Act, but again, it had no teeth.Collecting data is the first step for analysis of police killings in the United States. The data can then be used to understand and improve the issue.  Our government knows who we call on our cell phones, who we email, and probably even the contents of those calls and emails.  So the idea that our government is unable to record the names of the people it kills, and unable to explain why, is a ridiculous and dangerous idea.  We are proving it wrong.  2)  How do you collect the data?We collect data from news reports, from public records requests directly from police agencies, and from court filings and legal documents.  A small percentage of our data is ""crowdsourced,"" meaning anyone can research and submit information.  

3)  What kind of responses do you get from FOIA requests? We’ve requested data at the federal level and in several states. The responses from law enforcement have covered the gamut, from sending the information without comment or delay, to a delayed response, to answering the request in such a way as to make the information useless, down to outright refusal to obey public records laws, defying us to sue them.  Those refusals are informative in their own way.   4)  If this is crowdsourced, then why do you need money?While we allow “the crowd” to submit information, the crowdsourced information is now less than 5 percent of the database. We pay researchers for most of the data. Funding will allow us to finish the project more quickly.  Our current resources put us on pace to finish the first draft of the database in October 2017.   Fatal Encounters has already had an impact.  When we published our completed data for the years 2013 and 2014 we made a key contribution to the national conversation about police killings.  We proved that the annual total was much bigger—three times bigger—than the widely reported and accepted figures the FBI has been providing for years.  This simple but important breakthrough was driven by our research. The sooner we complete our database, the bigger impact we’ll have on the debate.  5)  What if you're overfunded?   We have other projects we’d like to do, like make many more public records requests, but that line item is pricey and unpredictable. If we by some chance get more funding than we ask for, we’ll apply the overage to extending the life of the project. As things stand—despite hand-wringing and grandstanding—the federal government has not funded a program to collect this information in a comprehensive manner, so it remains up to us to collect the data for the foreseeable future.  6)  Do you still take volunteers?
Absolutely.  Volunteers will always be at the heart of this effort.  The government has been ignoring the need to comprehensively collect this information for a very long time, and there’s a lot of work to do.  We have volunteers out there, helping with data entry, helping with a redesign of the site, doing visualizations, doing research with the data.
7)  What can you tell from the data so far? As an organization, our conviction has been that we will not do data analysis until the first draft of the dataset is complete for the United States going back to 2000. We've enabled news organizations, activists, universities and  law enforcement to do analysis. That said, there's some simple things that can be discerned. 
The numbers are far bigger than anybody—even us—anticipated.  When this project started in 2012, we thought we would be collecting data on about 6,000 incidents altogether.  That number is now a projected 24,000.  The higher number makes the work all that much more important.  Statistically, we find that people of color are killed at disproportionately higher rates than their shares of the general population.  Mentally ill people are a high percentage, at least 25-30 percent, of all people killed by police.  Around 94 percent of the people who die by gunshot are men.  And law enforcement in the Western states tend to kill more people per capita than Eastern ones.   Emerging state-to-state comparisons are fascinating.  8)  Aren’t you duplicating efforts with the Guardian, the Washington Post, Killed by Police, wikipedia, and other organizations doing the same thing? We have had working relationships with all of these projects.  Both the Guardian and the Washington Post used our data to start their own databases.  All these voices are welcome and needed.  The biggest difference between our effort and theirs is that we’re trying to gather the older data at the same time as we collect data moving forward. The older data is needed so that everyone can draw meaningful conclusions by comparing regions and deaths over time. Another huge difference is we're counting all types of deaths through police encounters. For example, the Washington Post only counts gun deaths. Fatal Encounters also counts deaths through use of stun guns, in police chases, choking deaths—whenever a police officer is present. The scope, depth, discipline, potential, and open-source philosophy of Fatal Encounters remains unique.  In an May 1, 2015, front-page story the New York Times described Fatal Encounters as “the most meticulous” of all similar projects.  Media organizations around the world are using our data.  And we’re in it for the long haul.

  9)  How does this actually help people?  There are lots of answers to that question.  They fall into three basic ideas. Simple visibility.  You cannot solve a problem until you know the size and shape of the problem.  This issue is greater and more urgent than we ever suspected.  People must know the risks of encountering police and watch their behavior around police.  This knowledge alone can save lives.  Gathering data is the only way to understand the underlying reality about police killings.  Researchers have uncovered correlations between police killings and victims’ characteristics, geography, and how those police forces are funded and trained and managed.  Popular opinion may consider young black men to be the most vulnerable population, and that may be true, but the data shows that other groups are at risk too.  Native Americans. The deaf.  The mentally ill.  The suicidal.  Motorcyclists.  Veterans.  Policemen’s spouses. And accountability.  Today some police departments laugh out loud at the idea that they are responsible to the public in any way.  They operate in secret.  Our current statistics show that officers who have killed on duty, whatever the circumstances, face criminal charges in less than 1 percent of deaths.  Police often appear immune to criminal indictment, let alone conviction.  So the families of victims seek justice with their only legal recourse, civil suits.  When they're successful, civil suits can award millions to survivors, burden taxpayers, and have absolutely no effect on how police operate.  There is no working feedback loop to decrease fatal police violence.  Laying groundwork towards effective police accountability is another important use for the data we gather.     With a successful crowdfunding campaign, we can make this problem visible in a way that can’t be denied.  We’ll be able to help identify best practices to support positive change.  When the best policies are in place, we’ll have fewer police killed by criminals and fewer individuals killed by police, which is the whole purpose of this project.
10)  Is my contribution tax-deductible? 
Fatal Encounters Dot Org is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  Our EIN (IRS tax exempt number) is 47-2263583. While we are a nonprofit, this fundraising campaign is not using  Indiegogo's nonprofit platform for logistical reasons. Particularly for larger donations, if you would like your donation to be tax-deductible, donate directly to Fatal Encounters Dot Org.",6.0,3,"1 Campaign

Workshops: No Country For Women has educated over 1500 students in various schools and colleges in Bangalore, India on the relationship between gender policing and rape. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.2. Conference: No Country For Women is hosting a day-long city-wide conference on August 23rd in Bangalore at the Leela Palace. The conference will feature in-depth discussions and analyses on the sociocultural roots of rape, as well as serve as a breeding ground for the development of effective long-term solutions. Attendees will include high school and college students, Human Resources professionals, psychologists, academics, activists, NGO representatives, corporate executives and more. By bringing together people from diverse walks of society, we hope to collapse the logistical barriers that become hurdles to interdisciplinary thought and action.3. Video Content: A mini-documentary about our work went viral (the video included above), amassing around 850,000+ views and 100,000+ shares in a week. The video explains the relationship between gender policing and rape, and initiated national discourse about the same.4. Social Art: No Country For Women is producing images with thought-provoking quotes intended to spark conversations. These posters are circulated digitally and placed around the city to kickstart a social art campaign. You can see some of these posters in the image tab of the campaign.
No Country For Women in the media:No Country For Women has been featured in numerous national and international publications, including Borgen Project and Policy Mic (USA), The Hindu, DNA India, Deccan Chronicle, Bangalore Times, Deccan Herald, Your Story, Social Story and Youth Ki Awaaz among others. You can see more details here: http://nocountryforwomen.org/mediaFuture Directions:No Country For Women has been invited to conduct workshops and organize events and talks all over the country. These include: TEDxLSR, Harvard-India Initiative, Coalescence (entrepreneurial summit at BITS-Pilani), Kshitij (IIT Kharagpur’s Techno-Management fest), Festember (NIT Trichy’s social and cultural fest) among others. We have been asked to partner with Social Development and Women’s Development Cells of colleges all over India and are in the process of developing long-term relationships with research institutions, NGOs and the education sector.Why This Campaign:We have been fortunate enough to receive fantastic national support so far. However, to expand and sustain our campaign, we need funding.We plan to do the following with our funds:1. Workshop toolkit: We will develop a comprehensive curriculum that transforms relevant social analysis into accessible educational material and will spark effective action. It will contain worksheets, presentation slides, examples, original studies we cite, pedagogical tools and activities and our own general guidelines on what we notice works in the classroom. We are already building a network within which to distribute this. 2. Expansion: We would like to take the campaign all over India and already have set plans for expansion in Delhi (and NCR), Mumbai, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Orissa.3. Partner with Teach For India: We will partner with TFI and train their volunteers to give our workshops. This way we will ensure our material is also made accessible to underprivileged students.4. Volunteer training: We will train and certify volunteers to give our workshops and talks.5. Conferences and events: We will organize more city-wide and national conferences and events to create spaces where mass-awareness can be spread and effective solutions can be brainstormed. These spaces will allow individuals from different parts of society to come together and work in conjunction to make changes.6. Social Art campaigns: We will launch several national social art campaigns where we circulate images and stories from people about everyday gender-based discrimination and violence. This will give people a platform to voice themselves and be heard.7. Bringing together individuals and organizations: We will facilitate relationships between individuals and organizations in diverse walks of society to create a self-sustainable community of changemakers with diverse strengths, who can add to solution-making in different ways.About Us:No Country For Women is run by three Brown University undergraduates - Shreena Thakore, Ria Vaidya and Rishabh Singh. Growing up in India, they experienced various forms of gender-based discrimination. Upon gaining the relevant analytical tools in college, they decided enough was enough. They were awarded a Davis Projects For Peace fellowship to carry out a social justice campaign of their own design and that’s how No Country For Women was born.Other Ways You Can Help:1. Spread the word! Share our website and Facebook to anyone that may be interested.2. Invite us! If you know of a school/college/workplace that might benefit from a workshop, let us know!3. Spark conversation! Notice how everyday seemingly innocent objects contribute to an overall culture of rape. Speak out next time you hear someone say “boys will be boys” or see a problematic commercial. 4. Email us! So we can figure out other collaborative possibilities",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Natasha and I am 26 years old medical assistant. I consider myself a member of the global cannabis culture over the last ten years, because being one doesn’t mean just smoking weed – it goes much wider. I joined cannabis activism in 2014 and since then I have been working with different associations, organizations and individuals on educating about cannabis. 15 months ago I started my own project too, called Domacica – First Serbian Cannabis Vlog, you might check it on the following <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGZVfLU4ICp4rCRCmf9pKug"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">link</a>.</p>

<p>*</p>
<p>Serbia obviously has very developed cannabis culture and a significant number of people here is very interested in preserving it. However, there is a big resistance for cannabis market here because we have the parts of society which are very traditional and ready for necessary actions. Basically, decriminalization of cannabis is the only thing that wouldn’t hurt anyone and that can help many people to continue with their work and life safely, happily, healthy and with dignity.</p>
<p>Our chances for a success in decriminalization are very high at this point, we only have one demand and people are ready to support us now more then ever. Our authorities are also ready to reconsider their policy , they prove us that through the last couple of years. So, now it’s up to us to show how peaceful and magnificent our community is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After many long brainstorms we created a 6- point program to  highlight the benefits of decriminalization and these are subjects:</p>
<p>1. Cannabis legislation</p>
<p>2. Cannabis (and) culture</p>
<p>3. Medical use of cannabis</p>
<p>4. Industrial and economical benefits of cannabis</p>
<p>5. Non-medical (recreational) use of cannabis</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Cannabis March, Sebia 2018 need 3000$ to be realized. Here are costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage: 400$</li>
<li>Sound system and microphones: 200$</li>
<li>Educational and promotional material: 500$</li>
<li>Special promotional material (flags and balloons): 300$</li>
<li>Bureaucratic costs: 200$</li>
<li>Shirts for security: 100$</li>
<li>The rest of money goes for internet marketing, IndieGoGo and eventual unplanned costs</li>
</ul>
<p>In this situation, more money means higher public reach and we want it HIGHest possible. Starting from Serbia we would like to spread the story about decriminalization of cannabis through the whole world. So, once Cannabis March is over our activities don’t stop. All photo, video and audio materials we’d create during the event will be used for making brief inspirational videos and stories about cannabis we want to send worldwide.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The current situation led us to the point where withdrawal is not an option, neither offence is. We want to prove that being cannabis activist means being brave,  peaceful, with dignity and that we are ready for making compromises and agreements. We want to show that we are not afraid and that our colleagues should not be as well, no matter where on the planet they live.</p>
<p>It is of great importance for all cannabis communities in the world to know that we mustn’t step out from accomplishing our basic human rights and that only united and through mutual support  we can make some changes.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Three things can make this event to be realized by backup plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authorities wouldn’t give us permission for making public gathering<br/>-This has never happened before and if happens March will be considered in <a href=""http://irka.org.rs/skk-beograd/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Social Cannabis Club Belgrade</a>.</li>
<li>Nobody shows up<br/>-Also never happened, because we have at least 100 people that always support our activities.</li>
<li><p>We don’t get enough money<br/>-We already have enough money for basic appearance, we just want it to be perfect. And with your help it could be usefull not just for Serbia, but for many other countrys.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This first phase will be a Malaria net deliver in the Belen District of Iquitos, Peru.  Belen is home to some 65,000 people, most of them poor, and many of whom live in extreme poverty with no clean water, proper sanitation, nor electric power distribution. 90% of homes house two or more families; some homes as many as five.</p>
<p>Most homes either float or are built on stilts, as the river level rises 15–30 feet throughout the year. Currently the water level is peaking to overflow capacity and in May it will start receding and that is when the trouble will start.<br/><br/>The standing water left behind is prime breeding ground for mosquitoes.  Is such a underdeveloped and populated area as Belen, Malaria and even Dengue Fever (another mosquito born virus) will run rampant.  With your help the children of Belen can be protected during this dangerous time of year and use the net for years to come.</p>
<p>During the Malaria net deliveries I will be using my TV experience to provide donors with LIVE Stream video tours of Belen (Via Facebook) and interview the children we are helping. I will also film the entire process which will be  produced into a video for the donors, and school children to learn more about Malaria, different cultures and societies.   </p>
<p>The funds will be used for Malaria nets, travel expense, and food.  We have many incredible perks for your generosity.  If we do not meet or surpass our goal I will still make that best of what I have and continue fighting to protect children from Malaria. </p>

<h3>Our History and Vision</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539363306/daxhwqhjoet3egccc6gv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Roger, CEO and co-founder of tip4good. My grandfather started a footwear manufacturing company in our homeland of Nicaragua back in 1956. In spite of revolutions, volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes, our company prospered. We made it a point of pride to pay our workers well, but this sometimes fell short of what they needed, especially in emergencies.</p>
<p>In the past few years, low-cost competition started hurting our business. We ultimately had to close the plant and layoff our employees. Now we will never be able to pay them again, much less raise their wages as we would have liked to.</p>
<p>Losing the factory was a big setback to our family. Reflecting on it, I started looking into what could be done to better the livelihoods of workers while running a business in such a cutthroat industry. What I found was a big surprise! It turns out there’s quite a lot of people all over the world concerned about this. Studies show they are willing to pay more for their shoes and clothes if they can be assured the extra money gets to the workers who made them. But how do you go about doing this?</p>
<p>Our idea grew out of this question, and, by stroke of luck, it just so happened that we went about solving it at precisely the same time that the technologies required to make it feasible were also coming online. This is the genesis of <strong>tip4good</strong> – a fortuitous intersection of philanthropy and mobile payments technology harnessed to enhance the livelihoods of garment workers.</p>
<p>We need a bold new approach to dealing this critical issue facing the fashion industry:  the 60 million factory workers who cut and stitch our clothes and shoes don’t earn enough income to provide a basic standard of living for themselves and their families. A garment worker is paid just a fraction of a cent per dollar on the retail price of an item. In some countries they take home as little as <strong>USD 55 per month!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539358025/heymouhdh2zhfjque567.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Most of the 80% of workers who are women are heads of household providing for children and older relatives. No one has found an effective sustainable way to get more income into the hands of these workers.  Funneling additional money down the supply chain by paying more at the cash register simply means it inevitably falls prey to the industry's rational profit-seeking stakeholders (retailers, brands, intermediaries, and suppliers). Expecting brands to coerce their supplier factories into paying their workers more while simultaneously demanding lower prices on their garments is wishful thinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But now there’s something we can do. If you feel compelled to make a personal impact, there’s no need to wait. <strong>tip4good</strong> allows you to take matters into your own hands and reach the worker directly. You may now pay her a gratuity to thank her for her awesome craftsmanship or simply because you’re aware that everyone on the team that made your shirt probably isn’t making enough to live a decent life, escape poverty, or have an opportunity to prosper. </p>
<p>We harness the global proliferation of mobile payments technology to allow you to get more money straight to these workers by generously thanking them with a gratuity. And being fully digital from end to end permits us do this with perfect traceability and transparency. That way we ensure that no funds are misappropriated and every gratuity gets to the workers who made that item.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>A participating brand instructs all its supplier factories to place a tip4good tag on each of its garments. The tags contain a unique QR code that identifies its work order as well as each worker who assembled that batch. Upon purchase, the consumer scans the QR code on the tag with her mobile phone, allowing her to select a gratuity payment as well as download our mobile app and register in our rewards program. The payment is sent to our clearinghouse where it is accumulated on its respective QR code account. Upon meeting a threshold the account is disbursed and paid out directly to digital wallets on the workers’ mobile phones. On all participating brands, users earn points that can be redeemed for all sorts of rewards: discounts, game tokens, event passes, status, etc.    </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>The impact on women’s empowerment could be especially significant as they comprise the vast majority of garment workers and most of them support entire families. The effect of optimized spending of enhanced income is amplified in these circumstances, as the household benefits disproportionately from additional spending on education, nutrition, childcare, healthcare, savings, and investment. The implications of being able to do something as mundane as simply giving families in the developing world a little more income could be nothing short of profound for mankind if this idea functions at scale.

<h2><strong>We need your help to take the LGBTI Pride Ecuador to GALAPAGOS </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Necesitamos tu ayuda para llevar el Orgullo LGBTI Ecuador a GALÁPAGOS </strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>We believe that it is very important to provide citizens with a space to approach and demystify and eradicate stereotypes around our sexuality, so this year the central theme of the LGBTI Pride Days of 2018 will revolve around the idea that the defense of The rights of LGBTI populations are not inconsequential, trivial or even insignificant. The populations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex in the Galapagos Islands form an important population group, both numerically and for the contributions made to society through the questioning of the sexist and patriarchal values ​​that have characterized the construction of the identity of the Western man. This theme invites us to reflect on the gaps and inequities between the population in general and LGBTI populations, while demanding equality before the law and the law.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<p>Consideramos que es muy importante brindar a la ciudadanía un espacio de acercamiento que permite desmitificar y erradicar los estereotipos alrededor de nuestra sexualidad, por tanto este año el tema central de las Jornadas del Orgullo LGBTI de 2018 girará alrededor de la idea de que la defensa de los derechos de las poblaciones LGBTI no es intrascendente, ni trivial o peor insignificante. Las poblaciones de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales, trans e intersex en las Islas Galápagos forman un importante conjunto poblacional, tanto numéricamente como por los aportes hechos a la sociedad mediante el cuestionamiento de los valores sexistas y patriarcales que han caracterizado la construcción de la identidad del hombre occidental.   Esta temática nos invita a la reflexión en torno a las brechas e inequidades entre la población en general y las poblaciones LGBTI, al tiempo que exige igualdad ante la ley y el derecho.</p>

We believe that it is very important to provide citizens with a space to approach and demystify and eradicate stereotypes around our sexuality, so this year the central theme of the LGBTI Pride Days of 2018 will revolve around the idea that the defense of The rights of LGBTI populations are not inconsequential, trivial or even insignificant. The populations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex in the Galapagos Islands form an important population group, both numerically and for the contributions made to society through the questioning of the sexist and patriarchal values ​​that have characterized the construction of the identity of the Western man. This theme invites us to reflect on the gaps and inequities between the population in general and LGBTI populations, while demanding equality before the law and the law.
 
Consideramos que es muy importante brindar a la ciudadanía un espacio de acercamiento que permite desmitificar y erradicar los estereotipos alrededor de nuestra sexualidad, por tanto este año el tema central de las Jornadas del Orgullo LGBTI de 2018 girará alrededor de la idea de que la defensa de los derechos de las poblaciones LGBTI no es intrascendente, ni trivial o peor insignificante. Las poblaciones de lesbianas, gays, bisexuales, trans e intersex en las Islas Galápagos forman un importante conjunto poblacional, tanto numéricamente como por los aportes hechos a la sociedad mediante el cuestionamiento de los valores sexistas y patriarcales que han caracterizado la construcción de la identidad del hombre occidental.   Esta temática nos invita a la reflexión en torno a las brechas e inequidades entre la población en general y las poblaciones LGBTI, al tiempo que exige igualdad ante la ley y el derecho.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>The non-profit <a href=""https://www.footforwardfund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Foot Forward Fund</strong></a> exists to empower women and girls in East Africa.  Among other things, we provide eco-friendly, locally made sanitary pads along with underwear and health and hygiene education to thousands of students who lack it. A collaboration between US and Tanzanian women, on a regular basis, we see firsthand the trepidation youth face when just starting their periods. So much of the anxiety comes from the taboos and mystery surround menstruation. </p>

<h2>So, What's A Cycle Circle?</h2>
<p>Cycle Circles are beaded bracelets in bright, bold colors which help the wearer track the phases of an approximated 28-day menstrual cycle. The Foot Forward Fund sells ""Action Kits"" containing all the necessary supplies to make Cycle Circles - <i>and when we say ""action"" - we mean it!</i></p>
<ul>
<li>You can make Cycle Circles for yourself or to share with someone just starting menstruation. Stringing the brightly-colored wooden beads on elastic is a simple, yet thought-provoking activity. As you string, conversations and connections happen. </li>
<li>We'll use proceeds from kit sales to fund eco-friendly menstrual hygiene products, underwear, and uplifting health and hygiene education for students living in extreme poverty in East Africa.</li>
<li>You can help our non-profit do <strong>EVEN</strong> more? After you make your Cycle Circles, return some (or all) of them to us and we'll use them to teach our menstrual hygiene education. <i>This is an awesome way to help address an important challenge - on your own, as part of a service group, or as a family activity.</i>

Despite our differences, we came together to support <a href=""https://www.bridgerefugees.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bridge</a> because of our commitment to our community. Read more about why we each chose to get involved below:</p><p><strong>Parker: </strong>Three years ago, I met a good friend of mine: she was smart, charismatic, and a natural-born leader. She was also a refugee. Fleeing violence in her native country of Sudan, Lala Hilizah and her family came to America in 2000, and have been living in Tennessee ever since. While she hasn't forgotten her roots, she never let her identity as a refugee limit her potential. She is now a sophomore at the University of the South, Sewanee. Her example inspired me to support Bridge so that more people like her would have access to the opportunity that America provides.</p><p><strong>Brian: </strong>I've always had a passion for community service, and Bridge shares that drive. By helping refugees settle into the area, Bridge actively makes east Tennessee a more diverse and welcoming place to live as well, which is something I think is important.</p><p><strong>David</strong>: Out of all the non-profit organizations, Bridge stood out the most for me. Being a first generation student, my parents had to go through the same hardships these refugees go through. Whether it be learning the culture, language, or finding a stable job to support their family. I feel for refugees and genuinely want to help them. </p><p><strong>Teal: </strong>The reason why I chose Bridge happened to me very recently. My brother was studying in Europe and my mother and I went to go visit him. While on the trip, we saw thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing from their homeland and crossing Europe to find safety. I had never seen anything like this. They had nothing but the things they could carry on their backs. This caused me to want to make a difference in East Tennessee, before the problem got too far out of hand.</p><h3>About Bridge: </h3><p>    Bridge Refugee Services is a nonprofit organization operating in Knoxville and Chattanooga. They have three signature programs, which includes case management, job placement, and school support. These programs ensure that refugees are able to sucessfully integrate into the community, and provide valuable lessons about American life and culture.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551979886/uvfvyrivbllwy6boeycg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>    The first program, case management, is the primary operation of Bridge. Case managers are the first contacts that clients meet at the airport, and counsel them as they adjust to life in America. This includes helping families navigate the confusing processes of accessing necessities like healthcare and utilities, as well as cultural orientation sessions in the first 90 days. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551979837/efftenglyokab3kushlj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>    The second service Bridge offers is their employment program. In order to help families become self-sufficient quickly, they provide job readiness training, interpretation services, post-employment follow-up, and referrals to additional resources. This ensures that the refugees Bridge works with are adequately prepared for the American job market, as there are often different customs surrounding work in different countries. As a result, they are more likely to be hired, and become even more of an asset to our community.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551980036/clakq9phmjfudj0mtzdr.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>    Finally, Bridge also helps parents with their School Impact program. This includes after-school tutoring and clubs/activities, parental involvement programs, training and support for Knox County Schools staff, and connection to bilingual/bicultural counselors. All parents want to see their child succeed, and that is especially true for refugees. Bridge ensures that all people can achieve that success. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551980092/lxwzvmy2ynhiu2jcpnmp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>     </p><p>    As a nonprofit, Bridge relies on charitable donations to provide their services. With immigration levels rising as a whole, the need for Bridge's resources will only grow in the future, and they will need our support to meet the challenge. Every donation matters, and the more we are able to raise will help our community become a welcoming home for all people. Please consider giving to or sharing this page, and know that your support can make the American dream a little more real for our new neighbors!</p><p> </p></div>","About Us:     As four students from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, we naturally have diverse backgrounds.

By helping refugees settle into the area, Bridge actively makes east Tennessee a more diverse and welcoming place to live as well, which is something I think is important.David: Out of all the non-profit organizations, Bridge stood out the most for me. Being a first generation student, my parents had to go through the same hardships these refugees go through. Whether it be learning the culture, language, or finding a stable job to support their family. I feel for refugees and genuinely want to help them. Teal: The reason why I chose Bridge happened to me very recently. My brother was studying in Europe and my mother and I went to go visit him. While on the trip, we saw thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing from their homeland and crossing Europe to find safety. I had never seen anything like this. They had nothing but the things they could carry on their backs. This caused me to want to make a difference in East Tennessee, before the problem got too far out of hand.About Bridge:     Bridge Refugee Services is a nonprofit organization operating in Knoxville and Chattanooga. They have three signature programs, which includes case management, job placement, and school support. These programs ensure that refugees are able to sucessfully integrate into the community, and provide valuable lessons about American life and culture.     The first program, case management, is the primary operation of Bridge. Case managers are the first contacts that clients meet at the airport, and counsel them as they adjust to life in America. This includes helping families navigate the confusing processes of accessing necessities like healthcare and utilities, as well as cultural orientation sessions in the first 90 days.      The second service Bridge offers is their employment program. In order to help families become self-sufficient quickly, they provide job readiness training, interpretation services, post-employment follow-up, and referrals to additional resources. This ensures that the refugees Bridge works with are adequately prepared for the American job market, as there are often different customs surrounding work in different countries. As a result, they are more likely to be hired, and become even more of an asset to our community.     Finally, Bridge also helps parents with their School Impact program. This includes after-school tutoring and clubs/activities, parental involvement programs, training and support for Knox County Schools staff, and connection to bilingual/bicultural counselors. All parents want to see their child succeed, and that is especially true for refugees. Bridge ensures that all people can achieve that success.          As a nonprofit, Bridge relies on charitable donations to provide their services. With immigration levels rising as a whole, the need for Bridge's resources will only grow in the future, and they will need our support to meet the challenge. Every donation matters, and the more we are able to raise will help our community become a welcoming home for all people. Please consider giving to or sharing this page, and know that your support can make the American dream a little more real for our new neighbors!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><br/></div>
<div>The project we are currently proposing: ""The Confessional"" will be a continual performance that will run for the entire 2016 presidential campaign. We are openly inviting the presidential hopeful, Mr. Trump-- to come confess for his sins. Mr. Trump has publicly announced he does not believe in reconciliation. We have produced a large mahogany confessional booth, replicating the style of confessionals in Latin America during the 19th century. We will invite Mr. Trump to come confess for his sins in our booth. If Mr. Trump does not confess we will invite participants to come and for him. The sound of participants confessing will be live-streamed to a local radio station. The public will also be invited to call into the radio station to confess for Mr. Trump. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The confessional is central to Western understanding of power structures and ""truth"" production. It is also a reoccurring performative gesture in American politics. ""The confessional is one of the main rituals [and apparatuses] we rely on for [so called] truth."" (Foucault) Within a structure of authority, the confession is a self-reflective act. But what if the during the confession the speaking subject is not the subject of the statement? How would that alter the very power-dynamics of the confessional exchange that has characterized American politics? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In the UK, the recently constructed millennial bridge physically connects the old church of England to the Tate Modern. ""Social Practice"" art has been critiqued for its deep catholic roots. Yet in a age of wide spread human crisis cultural activists have been productively pulling from spiritual practice, for instance, Ben Vicker's ""un-monasteries."" This project is not a critique or promotion of the catholic church. It is simply using a pre-existing daily ritual to re-examine a both personal and political performative exchange.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This work will first be performed this Tuesday at 8:00 PM during the democratic GOP debate. After the initial performance it will be repeated every Sunday in different small New York Churches until Mr. Trump confesses or his presidential campaign comes to an end.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Since an early age, it has been a dream of mine to go and visit Africa, even just for a while. Something about this continent has always excited me and I guess the main thing was that on all pictures I was seeing, people always looked so happy, somehow purely happy. I wanted to see that. Communicate with these people. Live with them. </p>

<p>Now, that I have a semester away from school, the timing seemed to be perfect and I started doing my research on different options for volunteering in Africa. I was immediately overwhelmed by the huge number of projects available out there. All of them had a very good cause, but they would accommodate you in a well-furnished room and provide you with all amenities  ...  and pay $3000 dollars for 2 weeks ?! I informed myself and discovered that very often very little (if any) of this money actually goes to deserving families in the region and is mostly kept by volunteer businesses focused on profit. <br/><br/> I didn't want that. By pure accident, I  landed on a Facebook page of an NGO located in Arusha, Tanzania, concerned with providing education for kids in the villages surrounding the city of Arusha. Out of curiosity, I sent them an email acquiring about more details. As it turned out, they were not asking for any monetary contributions, there was no one you had to pay to take part in, they didn't have any hidden fees - just pay for your flights and food, they will find accommodation for you. Perfect. The NGO was very small so I was communicating directly with the founder. In no time we went over my availability, arranged all the details and I was ready for my trip to Africa.</p>

<p>The time has finally come and on Novemeber 7th I am boarding a flight for Tanzania where I will spend a little more than a month. I will contribute some personal funds for the development of the school I will be at and for purchasing chairs for the library where the children study. In order to be as effective as I can be while there, I am reaching out for your help with the goal to raise $800. All the money raised will go towards providing school supplies and improving the school environment. I would be extremely thankful if you donate and contribute towards this cause. Regardless of amount, every donation will be highly appreciated and will make an enormous difference to the education in the village of Sanawari.</p>

<p><strong>Istanbul LGBTI+ Pride Week celebrates its 26th anniversary!</strong></p>
<p>Istanbul Pride Week, organised with the collective efforts of volunteers, who gather with open calls will take place this year 25 June- 1 July 2018.</p>
<p>Istanbul Pride has brought up various themes including “Beware of the Family!”, “Taboo”, “Memory”, “Contact”, “Normal?” and “We Unite!” in the last years. Once again this year, in addition to the the forums, panel discussions and events addressing issues such as health, visibility, and constitutional rights central to agenda of the LGBTI+ movement, we will also discuss how we can build a political sense of solidarity and how we can find alternative ways to achieve this, despite the state of emergency and oppression becoming more of a menace every single day.</p>
<p>To reach out each other, to heal our wounds, and to talk about our experiences, bodies, and emotions, we will come together at workshops, and we will celebrate our solidarity in parties. Just like every year, we will vote and elect this year’s hate speech champions among your nominations at the 14th ""Genetically Modified Tomatoes"" ceremony. We will extend our rebellion with our comrades coming from other cities for the Pride Week. We will continue to spread throughout the city and shout out loud that ""we are here"" with our stencils and our annual exhibition, which is organised with an open call to artists and through consensus.</p>
<p>Last year we reacted to the ban on our march by dispersing into every corner of Istanbul with glitter, confetti and rainbow flags, reading our press statements. We raised our voice not only on Istiklal Street but on every place and every space possible to make ourselves to be heard. From this point on, in the face of the every obstacle put on our way, every problem that makes our lives harder, we will continue to react even more creatively than ever before. We are not giving up on the streets, we are not letting any kind of fear to scare us away. We are here, we are not leaving, and get used to it!</p>
<p>We are waiting for your donations for the expenses of this week-long organisation that is put together with a collective solidarity without any funds granted:</p>
<p>• Travel and accommodation expenses for the local LGBTI+ organisations coming from all across Turkey</p>
<p>• Travel and accommodation for the panelists</p>
<p>• Communication/Press expenses (i.e. social media, website hosts) </p>
<p>• Genetically Modified Tomato Awards (i.e. production, décor, video recordings and editings)</p>
<p>• Event expenses (i.e. security, fees for some event spaces if necessary)</p>
<p>• Pride Week Exhibition (exhibition setup)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>*In the first descriptive title, we couldn't add ""+"" to ""LGBTI"" that we added a year ago to celebrate every kind of romantic/sexual orientation because of Indiegogo's interface structure, We are still working on that problem to solve it. </i></p>

<p><br/>Hello!</p>
<p>White Rose Faction is a fledgling team of activists &amp; educators who want to produce online video-essays, audio-commentaries and discussions for anti-racist organizers &amp; activists.</p>
<p>We've experimented with borrowing the hardware we need, but it's been either not suitable, or we've had the offer of help withdrawn.</p>

White Rose Faction is a fledgling team of activists & educators who want to produce online video-essays, audio-commentaries and discussions for anti-racist organizers & activists.
We've experimented with borrowing the hardware we need, but it's been either not suitable, or we've had the offer of help withdrawn.
Frankly, we're all absolutely broke right now - £150 would let us purchase a decent microphone, with a few quid left over for things we may have overlooked.
We understand that times are tight for many people right now, & that there are many worthwhile causes & campaigns that you could support.
If you've got £5 to spare, we'd really appreciate you helping us in advance - and we'd be able to get cracking with recording our material.
With your help, we'll be able to get out of this false-start & get out our first few videos as soon as possible.

<p>Imagine a show on network television that not only dismantled the arguments of the pro-death, but also did so in a winsome way that could be watched by believers and unbelieving friends and family alike. Making clear the value of the unborn child, while laying the foundation for the Gospel to be shared. Drawing a blank? We are launching a show to change that. From the director of Life Is Best, Adrian Rink, and the leading pro-life apologist in the nation, Scott Klusendorf, comes a pro-life series like you have never seen before.We are going to tackle issues like:</p>
<p>- Bodily Autonomy<br/>- Life of the Mother<br/>- Adoption<br/>- Those who are ignorant vs those who are opposed<br/>- Sidewalk Counseling<br/>- Post-Abortion Redemption<br/>- And so much more!</p>
<p>We know this is incredibly valuable content. And with your help, we can make it available for everyone to watch free! Equip your church, equip your family, and equip yourself in the battle for the unborn. Are you ready to defend life?</p>
<p><strong>Life with Scott</strong> will be a multi-episode docuseries answering questions around the life issue, providing arguments against abortion, and engaging with the death culture on relevant, current issues.</p>
<p>Watch as Scott Klusendorf, founder and president of <a href=""https://prolifetraining.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Life Training Institute</a>, interacts with students on college campuses about the Life issue.  Hear the answers to abortion arguments from Pro-Life experts like Megan Almon and Jannique Stewart.  Watch as pastors give practical advice and personal answers to people with abortions in their past or who are considering abortion in their futures.</p>
<p><strong>Life with Scott</strong> will cover major topics like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the objectivity of morality</li>
<li>the best flavor of ice cream</li>
<li>the difference between an unborn fetus and a 2 year old</li>
<li>Why S.L.E.D.s are so important to the Pro-Life proponents</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Life with Scott </strong>is a huge undertaking that will require partnership with YOU!  Drawing together components from so many sources will allow us to create a resource that will encourage pro-life experts, educate pro-life initiates, and explain our positions to pro-abortion advocates.</p>
<p>We need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your prayers!</li>
<li>Financial support for filming interviews with multiple pastors and pro-life experts and interactions with college students.</li>
<li>Support on social media as you share this project with your friends, families, and churches.</li>

<p>Our desire is that <strong>Life with Scott </strong>will be viewed by at least 3 people, though 3,000,000 would be even better.  We will be partnering with multiple pro-life organizations to get the news of this project out.  The best advertisement, though, will be you telling your friends and family about the series.  Share it on Facebook, Twitter, or in person to help us create a grassroots movement around this project.</p>
<p>Our base goal of $30,000 will allow us to make and distribute the entire first season, 13-20 episodes, of <strong>Life with Scott </strong>freely to all.  If we are able to exceed our goal amount, we have several stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50,000 - A PDF group discussion guide will be provided to go along with the show that allows school classes, Bible study groups, and families to use this in a formal education setting.</li>
<li>$85,000 - We will do commentary videos on the raw footage with <strong>Scott Klusendorf</strong>. This will allow more opportunities for education on how to speak on behalf of the unborn in the public square.</li>

<p>Hi. My name is Asad and I go by they/them pronouns.</p>
<p>I’m a Communication &amp; Design major at <a href=""https://habib.edu.pk/HU-news/meet-asad-aly-the-artist-behind-karachiscapes-ambience/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Habib University</a>, a liberal arts college in Karachi.<br/>In Fall 2017, I took an amazing course called<i> Feminism and Visual Culture </i>that, for me, opened up the possibility of using feminist texts and art to introspect my own relationships with my significant other, my body, land and identity.</p>
<p><strong>The product of the course was my artist’s book, <i>Gustakh</i>.</strong></p>
<p><i>Gustakh</i>’s title is inspired by a poem <i>Manto</i>, written by Majeed Amjad, in which he calls Saadat Hasan Manto a <i>gustakh</i> — a person who transgresses norm, convention, defiant of authority, disobedient to orders and disruptive to the order of society. A <i>gustakh </i>is daring, and not necessarily appealing to the population that gives in to the order, and conventional, naturalized ways of living.</p>
<p>A work in progress, <i>Gustakh </i>currently consists of my autoethnography — seven meditations coupled with photographs at appropriate intervals in print, exploring how I maneuver in a postcolonial, heteropatriarchal setting, which is body- and sex-negative, hyper-consumerist, favors elitism and other structural inequalities.</p>
<p>The <i>gustakhi </i>is the attempt to redefine love outside the heterosexual imagination through living experience rather than simply ideals. The art book is a coming together of critical writing and visual narratives, engaging with the politics of sexual identity to explore and produce new ways of seeing and imagining queer lives in the global south.</p>
<p><strong>I am truly honored to be offered a place at <a href=""http://queerasia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Queer Asia Conference 2018</a>, at SOAS, University of London, to share <i>Gustakh </i>with the world this June.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>How this conference will help me</strong></h3>
<p>Queer Asia is an inter-Asia collaboration, dialogue and research on issues affecting people who self-identify as LGBTQ+ or belong to other non-normative sexualities and gender identities in Asia, or Asian diasporas and beyond. It welcomes queer identifying scholars, academics, activists, artists and performers to present their work.</p>
<p>Queer Asia Conference 2018 is my chance to meet more <i>gustakh </i>and explore the potential of <i>Gustakh </i>as a publication for queer people to move away from the influences of the superstructures on how we live, how we love and how we write and tell our stories, and write, show and tell our stories truly our own terms, far from the heterosexual imagination, as a critique of capitalistic failure to acknowledge and accommodate queer people in their real realities.</p>
<p>The conference is also my opportunity to connect and receive critique from queer scholars, which is essential for this project to flourish.</p>
<h3><strong>How this will benefit my community</strong></h3>
<p>This is new work that will emerge out of Pakistan where the Western hegemonic, queer narrative does not receive the inquiry and critique it deserves, but rather is accepted among queer people who use this Western lens to make sense of their own identities, their bodies and desires. The dominant discourse on queer people in Pakistan is Orientalist. Sociology, anthropology and art, when combined, have the potential to subvert dominant discourses and open up new queer possibilities — <i>Gustakh </i>is first of its kind.</p>
<p>Discipline, in the literal sense, is to abide by the rules, not crossing boundary, while <i>Gustakh </i>is an interdisciplinary disruption, taking scholarship and visual culture critically to do some dismantling, for the living subjectivities of the queers in the global south to rise.</p>
<h3><strong>How you can help</strong></h3>
<p>While the conference has no registration fee, I cannot afford to travel to the UK and present it.</p>
<p>I’m currently in my third year at Habib University, dependent entirely on financial aid and <a href=""http://bit.ly/habibstory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">generous donors</a> who have paid for my admission and payable fee to get here. While it’s great to receive a better education than I can ever afford, my financial status does not allow me to travel and pursue opportunities of presenting my work.</p>
<p><i>Gustakh’</i>s selection for Queer Asia Conference 2018 at SOAS, University of London is beyond my wildest imagination. The book is the manifestation of my ‘failed’ body as I’ve always been treated as, and the love I’ve always been told to hide.</p>

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>We are five students from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville working to give back to the community through our project Vols for Kids. Vols for Kids works specifically to help the non-profit organization <a href=""http://casatnh.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CASA of the Tennessee Heartland</a>. We chose this organization because we feel as though non-profits helping abused and neglected children are sometimes over-looked.</p>
<p>CASA of the Tennessee Heartland (CASATNH) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit founded in 1988. Through volunteers, the organization provides a voice for abused and neglected children in the community. The volunteers within the organzation help children that have been brought into the court system through no fault of their own. CASATNH is a volunteer based organization, and with over one hundred volunteers. They served over three hundred children in 2017. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552590965/fw7vddrnnmlopwouw5qh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>CASA of the Tennessee Heartland is a volunteered based organization. These volunteers are used to advocate for abused and neglected children in the court system. Advocating for a child means a number of things, some of these include, being there for a child during court, taking a child to an athletic event, or even just buying a child a meal. </p>
<p>To help with the cost of recruiting and training volunteers, we have a goal of raising $1,100 which would help with the recruitment and training of two new volunteers. Each volunteer takes weeks of training before they are allowed to be placed with a child.</p>
<p>Currently CASA does not have enough volunteers to be placed with every child that needs one. To take some of the financial burden of the organization we have decided to help with this fundraiser to provide the funds to recruit and train two volunteers. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How this Helps:</h3>
<p>By providing advocates to children in the court system, this means that a child does not go through the court system by themselves. Children in this situation are in the court system due to abuse by their parents. A CASA volunteer is there to help a child and to make sure the child has a voice within the court system. </p>
<p>Research shows that children with a CASA volunteer do not get ""forgotten"" in the foster care system, they receive the necessary services, medications, and are less likely to return to the court system. </p>
<p>One volunteer can advocate for up to seven children at a time, with the recruitment and training of two new volunteers up to fourteen children do not have to face the court system by themselves. Two new volunteers effects the lives of countless children and as a result their lives are changed forever.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are:
We are five students from the University of Tennessee in Knoxville working to give back to the community through our project Vols for Kids. Vols for Kids works specifically to help the non-profit organization CASA of the Tennessee Heartland. We chose this organization because we feel as though non-profits helping abused and neglected children are sometimes over-looked.
CASA of the Tennessee Heartland (CASATNH) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit founded in 1988. Through volunteers, the organization provides a voice for abused and neglected children in the community. The volunteers within the organzation help children that have been brought into the court system through no fault of their own. CASATNH is a volunteer based organization, and with over one hundred volunteers. They served over three hundred children in 2017. 

 

What We Need:
CASA of the Tennessee Heartland is a volunteered based organization. These volunteers are used to advocate for abused and neglected children in the court system. Advocating for a child means a number of things, some of these include, being there for a child during court, taking a child to an athletic event, or even just buying a child a meal. 
To help with the cost of recruiting and training volunteers, we have a goal of raising $1,100 which would help with the recruitment and training of two new volunteers. Each volunteer takes weeks of training before they are allowed to be placed with a child.
Currently CASA does not have enough volunteers to be placed with every child that needs one. To take some of the financial burden of the organization we have decided to help with this fundraiser to provide the funds to recruit and train two volunteers. 
 

How this Helps:
By providing advocates to children in the court system, this means that a child does not go through the court system by themselves. Children in this situation are in the court system due to abuse by their parents. A CASA volunteer is there to help a child and to make sure the child has a voice within the court system. 
Research shows that children with a CASA volunteer do not get ""forgotten"" in the foster care system, they receive the necessary services, medications, and are less likely to return to the court system. 
One volunteer can advocate for up to seven children at a time, with the recruitment and training of two new volunteers up to fourteen children do not have to face the court system by themselves. Two new volunteers effects the lives of countless children and as a result their lives are changed forever.


Perks:
Donations of all amounts will help us reach our goal of $1100, and to show our gratitude we have a wide range of perks starting at $10. Options include a social media shoutout, t-shirts, and two free tickets to the next upcoming event, as well as a number of other gifts to express our gratitude.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Millions of Syrians are now refugees in

small businesses. Syrians are extremely resourceful, they have to be.
 This project is about telling the stories of these people as they
find ways to rebuild their lives in a foreign country. I have kept
many of my contacts with Syrians in Jordan. The plan is to follow up
on them as well as meet new Syrians to see how their lives have
changed in the last year. The objective is to show that although they
are refugees they are no different to you and me, they desire

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I will also donate 20% of the profit from sales of the book and any photographic works to buy medicines for Syrian refugees.

While for developed countries, substantial statistical information exists on the ages and numbers of widows, the data available on the subject of widowhood for developing countries are extremely limited. Following the death of a male head of household, it is common for relatives, community members, authority figures and other opportunists to plunder the property (including the home and its surrounding gardens) that belonged to the deceased or to the couple jointly.</p><p>Land security is essential to livelihood security for most Ugandans, as over 85% of those who live in rural areas depend on agriculture as the major contributor to their livelihoods.  When widows become victims of property grabbing, they lose not only their homes and personal possessions, but their sources of food and income. As a result, they may become homeless, malnourished, driven further into poverty and vulnerable to further exploitation. In developed countries, widowhood is experienced primarily by elderly women, while in developing countries it also affects younger women, many of whom are still rearing children. In some regions, girls become widows before reaching adulthood.</p><h2>LEGAL &amp; SOCIAL REALITIES</h2><p>While the Ugandan Penal Code and other statutes do not include a specific offense called “property grabbing,” the act of stealing a widow’s land violates numerous criminal statutes. Although many property grabbing perpetrators attempt to hide behind customary practices of refusing women and children the right to own property, the Constitution and laws of Uganda supersede such traditions, guaranteeing the equality of land and inheritance rights between men and women as well as the equal protection of the civil and criminal law. Unfortunately, property grabbing against women remains entrenched in the sociocultural and gender norms of Uganda, and the Ugandan public justice system has not effectively delivered on the aspirations of protection and security promised by the law of Uganda.</p><h2>SOLUTIONS</h2><p>AWYD aims to provide capacity building through legal advocacy on property issues, business trainings, technical support and micro-loans to struggling widows in Uganda, empowering them to start small businesses and create a better life for their families.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559308179/vzoblpox7fnbcd130goj.jpg"" src=""""/>We have just published a book called “The Widows Club”, which features authentic, haunting images and stories of 26 widows and their children. It’s an inspiring piece that offers stories of hope, heartbreak &amp; humanity. The proceeds from the sale of this book will go towards a micro-lending program.  </p><p>Today most of the widows and their families survive on one meal a day with very poor diets or even go without food entirely for the day. Worst of all, many needy fatherless children are not getting educated because their mothers or guardians cannot afford to pay to keep them in school. The borrower's priorities for the use of their profits from the business are: better nutrition, healthcare and covering school fees for their children.</p><h2>FUNDING WIDOWS</h2><p>Through our participatory approach we will provide interest-free loans to women to start up their own businesses. We will also organize weekly business trainings and will be available to give technical support and business advice to them. Once Loans are paid, we collect and give it to another borrower. Hence revolving funds, moving from one woman to another. Helping needy families afford the basics of life like food, shelter and sending children to school is our goal. By providing a hand-up to struggling widows, we will be helping them achieve their dreams. This fundraising campaign will be a catalyst for change, breaking the viscous cycle of poverty and energizing the community as widows become productive and send their children to school.</p><p>We thank you for your heart-felt consideration of this noble cause. Your donation will be immensely appreciated. Please also circulate our campaign to help us reach our goal.</p><p>Blessings to you and your family. Respectfully,</p><p><strong>Muwayire Henry</strong><br/>Director at AYWD</p><div>

<p> </p>
<p>We would like to kindly submit in our humble application for consideration of grant support from your esteemed organization.</p>
<p>The grant support would assist us to successfully empower and carry out capacity building / skills training of poor rural Widows i.e. Young mothers from forced and early marriages, victims of domestic violence, HIV/AIDS and women from conflict and post conflict area, enable the organization publish a book on plight of widows for sale in order to fundraise and extend a revolving fund to these poor rural women in the poorest and remote parts of our country to enable them start or improve on their micro-enterprises/income generating micro-projects.</p>
<p>AYWD Uganda is a registered non-profit organization with an innovative approach to empowering women and the youth economically, academically, health wise through pooling resources to help them make ends meet. Believing education to be the single most powerful tool available for reducing poverty in developing young people especially women and young mothers an opportunity to learn the skills needed to earn a living. A focus on agricultural education recognizes the central role of agriculture in the world’s least developed countries as a source of income generation, employment, and food security.</p>
<p>This support would go a long way in the transforming of the economic and social lives of our rural poor women who are often marginalized and lack access to means of production.  We have attached on this letter a copy of our itemized budget for the project.  Our local contribution towards the cost of the project is expected to be CAN $ 9,230.</p>
<p>We shall be very grateful if our project application will be considered.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>CAPACITY BUILDING AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT FOR RURAL AYWD UGANDA COMMUNITY WOMEN GROUPS IN THE DISTRICT OF WAKISO.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>In Uganda, children and women experience daily acts of violence at an alarming rate in homes, schools, and communities. Domestic beatings, physical and sexual abuse, and rape or defilement are daily realities that are robbing children and women of their rights and putting their lives at risk. Children in particular suffer abusive power relationships, corporal punish­ment as a method of discipline, and child mar­riage – each a form of violence that is accepted in some corners of Ugandan society. In Uganda, as in other countries, traditions are often used to justify violent acts.</p>
<p>Gender plays an important role in patterns of violence. A lack of options for a girl living in a household means she becomes a burden, a factor contributing to forced early marriage. A woman who is poor and has little options for attaining financial security, or has no access to natural resources, including ownership of land, can be stuck in a life of dependence and at increased risk of gender-based violence.</p>
<p>The most vulnerable of Uganda’s society– youth living on the streets, children who are orphaned, child labourers, or child brides, for instance – are extremely prone to experiencing violence and exploitation. It’s estimated that Uganda has nearly 7.5 million children and youth living in vulnerable situations, and therefore those many millions of Uganda’s future are at risk of having their rights stripped and their lives put at risk.</p>
<p>We at AYWD Uganda have been sensitizing community on issues related to domestic violence, early and forced marriage, human rights, child right and how to smartly leave homes or places where they are subdued in to being domestically abused. The greatest challenge of children and women who are victims of domestic violence is access to shelter and food. Those basic needs have left women to die in silence because they have no financial power to support themselves and their children. A case was captured by AYWD Uganda where a woman hanged herself because of the pain and trauma she was facing, yet she also had no one to run to for help. AYWD Uganda has been sensitizing communities about Domestic violence and its impact on derailing development of children, women and their communities at large.  We have trained many of them in basic skills however, the biggest challenge AYWD Uganda is facing is securing micro-finance services for these women to engage in economic activities for the betterment of their livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong></p>
<p>Women and girls continue to suffer from all forms of Gender Based Violence (GBV), be it physical, economic, emotional and sexual. Gender based violence (GBV) has serious implications for the development of girls and the advancement of women as well as their contribution towards national development. Coupled with these is the weak capacity of institutions to provide redress to victims of GBV especially widows.</p>
<p>Domestic violence is much more rooted from the economic inequalities of women and men and further accelerated by cultural norms. Availing basic skills training and availability of women user friend micro-finance services aimed at improving the livelihood of disadvantaged women groups translated in to have women entrepreneurs having confidence, voice, influence and access to services and opportunities. Women’s access to credit is constrained by unfavorable terms and conditions of credit schemes, need for collateral, high interest rates and small loan sizes.  Therefore, this micro-finance project will focus on providing finance capital for building the capacity of cadres of women Entrepreneurs to establish and sustain viable and competitive enterprises to serve as the backbone of communities, regional and National growth and transformation. Interventions will focus on building skills and knowledge in business and entrepreneurial skills and tap opportunities in key agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and also improve women’s access to employment, credit, financial services and other productive resources.</p>

<p><strong>Organisation Review and Profile of AYWD Uganda</strong></p>
<p><strong>General Information</strong></p>
<p>(AYWD Uganda) is a non-profit. AYWD Uganda works with rural marginalized women groups and their Children in Uganda in order to alleviate poverty and improve on their livelihoods.</p>
<p>AYWD Uganda has been providing women with  training in basic life skill, HIV/Aids awareness and Positive Living for those living with the virus, for victims of  Domestic Violence we provide  psycho-social support, temporally shelter, basic skills training, sensitizing them on Human Right, children rights, education and Functional Adult Literacy and Credit extension so that the marginalized rural women can create or expand Micro Businesses they can  plan and manage themselves to generate income for their households.  The objective is to liberate these women from dependence on their abuser, and their deprivation of social and economic power.</p>
<p>The Capacity Building and Revolving Fund Program is based on the concept that these women have already received some training which mean that they have the capability and ingenuity to create viable micro-enterprises, agricultural and non-agricultural.  With access to Micro-finance capital and training, they can make their potential a reality.  This AYWD Uganda Revolving Fund Program emphasizes strengthening business skills so that women entrepreneurs are better equipped to sustain and expand their project businesses.  These agricultural and non-agricultural businesses are based on products or services that these know how to make or do, for which there are local markets.</p>
<p>The program is to be implemented by a team of trained Field Officers and Trainers who love their work and their clients to help them develop their business projects.  The Trainers and Field officers facilitate the Credit program including vetting, selecting and training the needy entrepreneurs, approving business plans, monitoring and supervising credit and loan tracking activities and reporting to head office. This will all be documented on the procured laptops to evaluate project progress.</p>
<p><strong>What we have - Our Present Strengths:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We have 10 Trainers / Trained Credit / field Officers who carry out training in group formation, group management &amp; group dynamics, savings and Business Management Skills and Pre-loan disbursement education.  The Credit program is headed by the Director assisted by the Treasurer / Credit Manager and Program Coordinator.</li>
<li>We have a network of 150 AYWD Uganda Community Group Widows who are beneficiaries of the psycho-social support, shelter, basic skills training and our no to Domestic Violence Campaign who are part of our outreach with 15 beneficiary groups. </li>
<li>We have a geographical outreach/coverage of Wakiso District.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Needs </strong><strong>Present problems and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Inadequate funds to extend revolving loans to needy women groups so as to economically empower them and reduce the risks of them falling in the hands of their abusers because of lack of access to food and other basic needs.  By linking vocational and entrepreneurial education, women not only receive practical instruction on how to produce, but also acquire the business skills needed to earn themselves a living. The production and sale of products that this entails generates income which women are able to use to support their households. This focus on financial sustainability means that every money invested in developing women economic and entrepreneurship capacity at community level will continues to have an impact year after year.</p>
<p>The need to build women’s financial base capacity and create new livelihoods is critical for the peaceful development of any developing country such as Uganda. I hope that our approach inspires your trust to share that vision, and to invest in the future of women as the best approach of changing and improving household incomes and access to basic needs of these community women.</p>
<p>Access to credit, Basic skills Education and training are fundamental tools of empowerment. They provide the poor and disadvantaged women with the means to increase their productivity and income earning power. Education and training can enhance the bargaining power of community women; foster assertiveness and self-confidence; promote greater awareness of legal and social rights; and improve access to and use of economic resources such as jobs, land, credit, and information.  Access to credit, Basic skills Education and training programs are geared towards transformation and structural adjustments of community women economic independence, which increases their control over decisions, resources and structures affecting their lives. In this way, education creates conditions for full and equal participation of people in discussions and decisions, and at the same time empowers all people to act for change.</p>
<p>Lack of proper documentation of the project progress mainly because we lack computers to store the data. Most of the information on beneficiaries, loans, savings and current status of businesses is stored on papers</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>AYWD Uganda Scheme / Group Lending Methodology:</strong></p>
<p>This Revolving Fund lending program is based on group lending methodology where needy solidarity groups of 10 women form a borrowing group, but each person has her own business to start or run.  The group members co-guarantee each other’s loans.  There is no collateral, as the poor women lack assets to stake for the loans.  But the group members use peer pressure to ensure loan repayments are done on time and in full.  A built-in saving scheme enables the poor women grasp the essence of savings and to experience a process of financial discipline.  These Savings are handled and managed within and by group members and their group leaders.   The groups are encouraged to open up Bank Accounts with commercial banks of their own choice to keep this savings, before they are transferred to us for custody.  Business counselling and training continues throughout the loan term provided by Group Mentors and Field Officers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559314800/uvjnbqeac4d5n7xufq5d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>AYWD Uganda teaches /trains the women groups how to make small savings every week and acquire financial discipline. This savings discipline therefore provides some level of security for the loan program. Therefore, the following conditions obtain under our Credit Extension program:</p>

<p>The loan beneficiaries submit a business plan which is first appraised at group level before being sent to our organisation for appraisal before receiving the first cycle of loan of US$ 100. They receive the second cycle of loans after submitting a business report, which demonstrates that they have kept records, have established viable enterprises and met program requirements.  The clients continue to save in order to qualify for the next higher loan in the next cycle.  Loan periods are between 4 to 6 months.  A minimal interest rate of 3% per month is charged on the loans to enable the program meet its operational costs and to address the need for sustainability strategy and expand its capital base to serve more new members. 15 organised groups have been identified by our Field Staff and need refresher capacity building /training and later credit extension.  A total of 150 women form the 15 groups for which the grant is sought.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559314874/hfpevyfwyy9hol7sjhq3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Credit Program is to provide low-income women especially victims of Domestic Violence, single mothers living with HIV/AIDS, the opportunity to establish profitable micro-businesses (agricultural and non-agricultural) and increase their incomes, helping them to meet their families’ basic needs.  In addition, they develop organizational, leadership, entrepreneurial, financial management skills, the ability to save and re-invest, and increased confidence in themselves and their future.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of Group Lending Methodology:</strong></p>
<p>AYWD Uganda has been conveniently and efficiently providing these women with psycho-social support, training in basic life skills, financial and business management, agricultural business practices with a value chain approach. The organization is reaching a significant number of the poor marginalized women and victims of Domestic Violence, however there is a high demand for financial capital (micro-credit services for these women).  Hence a need to have more capital resources to step up these women economic empowerment through access to credit.</p>
<p><strong>Use for which the funds are requested:</strong></p>
<p>The grant component we want funding for is primarily for providing Revolving Fund to marginalized Women Groups, refresher training, logistics and publication of 500 copies to be sold and revenue used to increase the organizations capacity to reach more widows. Capacity building and training will be carried out in the following areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Group Management / Group dynamics</li>
<li>In entrepreneurial skills development</li>
<li>In micro-projects investment/Business management</li>
<li>In Book-keeping skills and</li>
<li>Those with agricultural projects (value addition)</li>
</ol>
<p>Loans will then be extended to these women groups hence economically, socially empowering them and further building their capacity to provide for their families. The grant support will help increase self-respect and esteem among the local women and hence liberating them economically, physically, and socially.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Beneficiaries of the anticipated grant project funds:</strong></p>
<p>The beneficiaries will be 150 poor rural / needy women in Wakiso District.</p>
<p><strong>Intended benefits to the beneficiaries:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Building capacity in skills such as entrepreneurial/business management skills, leadership skills.</li>
<li>Empowering beneficiaries economically towards self-sufficiency to enable beneficiaries generate enough income for their households.</li>
<li>Social emancipation of rural women (they will learn leadership skills and group organisation and management) to enable them participates fully in the social and economic life of this country.</li>
<li>Acquisition of literacy and functional skills, credit with education will equip functional skills and literacy skills to needy women since this will be incorporated as a training component.  They will be able now to identify, buy or grow and provide nutritious foods for their children to combat malnutrition and marasmus and feed a balanced diet to their households.</li>
<li>They will mobilise savings, build and internalise a culture of savings and develop financial discipline through systematic and spontaneous savings under the credit programme.</li>
<li>Young women with no capital or incomes who would otherwise resort to a life of crime, prostitution would now become economically productive and escape temptations of promiscuity and risking HIV/AIDS as well as surviving fall back in to abusive relationships.</li>
<li>At least by the end of the 2 years each woman should have her own plot of land and a one or two-bedroom house.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Resource Requirements:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Funds are required for the Revolving Loan facilitation, training to 150 rural women in 15 groups.</li>
<li>Funds for logistical support, such as for training venues, accommodation for facilitators, meals, refreshments, transport, fuel, stationery, typesetting, typing and printing, photocopying, and binding workshop materials.</li>
<li>Procurement of 5 laptops for proper documentation of activities, outcomes, outputs of the project and storage of current and previous data</li>
<li>Funds to publish 500 books titled the plight of widows in Uganda and their fatherless children to sale to raise revenue for the organizations outreach to other widows.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559315049/jccibhrotrxtv8nzbxet.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to grant support, the following sources will also be considered to sustain the programme.</p>
<ul>
<li>Internal sources such as retained earnings and surplus from the lending program will need to be ploughed back, to increase the loan portfolio / capital base.</li>
<li>In addition, external sources of funds such as soft loans and commercial loans will also be used to finance the planned development.</li>
<li>Earnings from the sale of 500 books which will increase the number of beneficiaries served and skilled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Source of our present funds</strong></p>
<p>Our organization has been able to get some funding and or logistical support from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local savings from members – locally mobilised savings</li>
<li>Board members’ contributions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Movement towards financial independence</strong></p>
<p>Our staff are already trained in Micro-finance best practices and loan tracking systems.  In addition, government policy which favours decentralization of services and the setting up of village banks, rural credit schemes and micro-finance institutions have greatly favoured our operations.  The passing of the Micro-Financing Bill into a law will greatly favours Micro-Finance operations in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Project self-sustainability</strong></p>
<p>Our micro-credit program is projected to fully reach self-sufficiency by December 2021 in two (2) years’ time.  An increased clientele will mean more interest revenue for the program, which will contribute to a growing revolving fund and a reduced cost per unit of loan lent.  Measures to be taken to reduce long-term dependence on grants and subsidies will include re-capitalizing our loan portfolio by ploughing back interest earned from the loan-lending program. With our growth plan, we are fully set to become self-sustainable by the end of the year 2021 and to attain operational efficiency at the beginning of June 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559315146/kflxtuzi3hh6wzjzxhnb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A loan loss reserve fund of 5% of the loan portfolio will be set aside to insure any bad debts.  This money will be put on a Fixed Deposit Account at a Commercial Bank to earn us a fixed deposit interest rate of 5% per month.  As a measure to safeguard against bad debts.  Then we plan to take an Insurance Policy and Insurance Program for women group loans with a local Insurance Company.  Careful loan portfolio management and loan tracking will be applied to enhance portfolio quality.  Already 5 staff have been trained in loan tracking and MFI best practices.</p>
<p>Our Revolving Fund program hopes to build a solid and growing fund base with clear business plans, backed by operational capacities that lead to mobilization of commercial funds from depositors and the financial system and eventually to full independence from donor support by the end of the year 2021 by generating its own income and enough to sustain the program.</p>
<p><strong>Our Future plans</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To expand our Revolving Fund Program to target all other marginalized women who may be in need of the support. We will continue training and sensitization, advocacy for women rights and emancipation train and to have continuous follow up.  Development programs and projects that provide women with employment. </li>
<li>Document all the loan portfolio on the laptops and the success stories of all the beneficiaries. Also, setup a website for international viewing of the project progress.</li>
<li>Lobby and source for agricultural inputs and mechanization grants/loans to accelerate commercial farming projects for these women Group and many more.</li>

While for developed countries, substantial statistical information exists on the ages and numbers of widows, the data available on the subject of widowhood for developing countries are extremely limited. Following the death of a male head of household, it is common for relatives, community members, authority figures and other opportunists to plunder the property (including the home and its surrounding gardens) that belonged to the deceased or to the couple jointly.Land security is essential to livelihood security for most Ugandans, as over 85% of those who live in rural areas depend on agriculture as the major contributor to their livelihoods.  When widows become victims of property grabbing, they lose not only their homes and personal possessions, but their sources of food and income. As a result, they may become homeless, malnourished, driven further into poverty and vulnerable to further exploitation. In developed countries, widowhood is experienced primarily by elderly women, while in developing countries it also affects younger women, many of whom are still rearing children. In some regions, girls become widows before reaching adulthood.LEGAL & SOCIAL REALITIESWhile the Ugandan Penal Code and other statutes do not include a specific offense called “property grabbing,” the act of stealing a widow’s land violates numerous criminal statutes. Although many property grabbing perpetrators attempt to hide behind customary practices of refusing women and children the right to own property, the Constitution and laws of Uganda supersede such traditions, guaranteeing the equality of land and inheritance rights between men and women as well as the equal protection of the civil and criminal law. Unfortunately, property grabbing against women remains entrenched in the sociocultural and gender norms of Uganda, and the Ugandan public justice system has not effectively delivered on the aspirations of protection and security promised by the law of Uganda.SOLUTIONSAWYD aims to provide capacity building through legal advocacy on property issues, business trainings, technical support and micro-loans to struggling widows in Uganda, empowering them to start small businesses and create a better life for their families.We have just published a book called “The Widows Club”, which features authentic, haunting images and stories of 26 widows and their children. It’s an inspiring piece that offers stories of hope, heartbreak & humanity. The proceeds from the sale of this book will go towards a micro-lending program.  Today most of the widows and their families survive on one meal a day with very poor diets or even go without food entirely for the day. Worst of all, many needy fatherless children are not getting educated because their mothers or guardians cannot afford to pay to keep them in school. The borrower's priorities for the use of their profits from the business are: better nutrition, healthcare and covering school fees for their children.FUNDING WIDOWSThrough our participatory approach we will provide interest-free loans to women to start up their own businesses. We will also organize weekly business trainings and will be available to give technical support and business advice to them. Once Loans are paid, we collect and give it to another borrower. Hence revolving funds, moving from one woman to another. Helping needy families afford the basics of life like food, shelter and sending children to school is our goal. By providing a hand-up to struggling widows, we will be helping them achieve their dreams. This fundraising campaign will be a catalyst for change, breaking the viscous cycle of poverty and energizing the community as widows become productive and send their children to school.We thank you for your heart-felt consideration of this noble cause. Your donation will be immensely appreciated. Please also circulate our campaign to help us reach our goal.Blessings to you and your family. Respectfully,Muwayire HenryDirector at AYWD

CAPACITY BUILDING AND EMPOWERMENT PROJECT FOR RURAL AYWD UGANDA COMMUNITY WOMEN GROUPS IN THE DISTRICT OF WAKISO.
 
Background
In Uganda, children and women experience daily acts of violence at an alarming rate in homes, schools, and communities. Domestic beatings, physical and sexual abuse, and rape or defilement are daily realities that are robbing children and women of their rights and putting their lives at risk. Children in particular suffer abusive power relationships, corporal punish­ment as a method of discipline, and child mar­riage – each a form of violence that is accepted in some corners of Ugandan society. In Uganda, as in other countries, traditions are often used to justify violent acts.
Gender plays an important role in patterns of violence. A lack of options for a girl living in a household means she becomes a burden, a factor contributing to forced early marriage. A woman who is poor and has little options for attaining financial security, or has no access to natural resources, including ownership of land, can be stuck in a life of dependence and at increased risk of gender-based violence.
The most vulnerable of Uganda’s society– youth living on the streets, children who are orphaned, child labourers, or child brides, for instance – are extremely prone to experiencing violence and exploitation. It’s estimated that Uganda has nearly 7.5 million children and youth living in vulnerable situations, and therefore those many millions of Uganda’s future are at risk of having their rights stripped and their lives put at risk.
We at AYWD Uganda have been sensitizing community on issues related to domestic violence, early and forced marriage, human rights, child right and how to smartly leave homes or places where they are subdued in to being domestically abused. The greatest challenge of children and women who are victims of domestic violence is access to shelter and food. Those basic needs have left women to die in silence because they have no financial power to support themselves and their children. A case was captured by AYWD Uganda where a woman hanged herself because of the pain and trauma she was facing, yet she also had no one to run to for help. AYWD Uganda has been sensitizing communities about Domestic violence and its impact on derailing development of children, women and their communities at large.  We have trained many of them in basic skills however, the biggest challenge AYWD Uganda is facing is securing micro-finance services for these women to engage in economic activities for the betterment of their livelihood.
Justification
Women and girls continue to suffer from all forms of Gender Based Violence (GBV), be it physical, economic, emotional and sexual. Gender based violence (GBV) has serious implications for the development of girls and the advancement of women as well as their contribution towards national development. Coupled with these is the weak capacity of institutions to provide redress to victims of GBV especially widows.
Domestic violence is much more rooted from the economic inequalities of women and men and further accelerated by cultural norms. Availing basic skills training and availability of women user friend micro-finance services aimed at improving the livelihood of disadvantaged women groups translated in to have women entrepreneurs having confidence, voice, influence and access to services and opportunities. Women’s access to credit is constrained by unfavorable terms and conditions of credit schemes, need for collateral, high interest rates and small loan sizes.  Therefore, this micro-finance project will focus on providing finance capital for building the capacity of cadres of women Entrepreneurs to establish and sustain viable and competitive enterprises to serve as the backbone of communities, regional and National growth and transformation. Interventions will focus on building skills and knowledge in business and entrepreneurial skills and tap opportunities in key agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and also improve women’s access to employment, credit, financial services and other productive resources.

Organisation Review and Profile of AYWD Uganda
General Information
(AYWD Uganda) is a non-profit. AYWD Uganda works with rural marginalized women groups and their Children in Uganda in order to alleviate poverty and improve on their livelihoods.
AYWD Uganda has been providing women with  training in basic life skill, HIV/Aids awareness and Positive Living for those living with the virus, for victims of  Domestic Violence we provide  psycho-social support, temporally shelter, basic skills training, sensitizing them on Human Right, children rights, education and Functional Adult Literacy and Credit extension so that the marginalized rural women can create or expand Micro Businesses they can  plan and manage themselves to generate income for their households.  The objective is to liberate these women from dependence on their abuser, and their deprivation of social and economic power.
The Capacity Building and Revolving Fund Program is based on the concept that these women have already received some training which mean that they have the capability and ingenuity to create viable micro-enterprises, agricultural and non-agricultural.  With access to Micro-finance capital and training, they can make their potential a reality.  This AYWD Uganda Revolving Fund Program emphasizes strengthening business skills so that women entrepreneurs are better equipped to sustain and expand their project businesses.  These agricultural and non-agricultural businesses are based on products or services that these know how to make or do, for which there are local markets.
The program is to be implemented by a team of trained Field Officers and Trainers who love their work and their clients to help them develop their business projects.  The Trainers and Field officers facilitate the Credit program including vetting, selecting and training the needy entrepreneurs, approving business plans, monitoring and supervising credit and loan tracking activities and reporting to head office. This will all be documented on the procured laptops to evaluate project progress.
What we have - Our Present Strengths:

We have 10 Trainers / Trained Credit / field Officers who carry out training in group formation, group management & group dynamics, savings and Business Management Skills and Pre-loan disbursement education.  The Credit program is headed by the Director assisted by the Treasurer / Credit Manager and Program Coordinator.
We have a network of 150 AYWD Uganda Community Group Widows who are beneficiaries of the psycho-social support, shelter, basic skills training and our no to Domestic Violence Campaign who are part of our outreach with 15 beneficiary groups. 
We have a geographical outreach/coverage of Wakiso District.

 

 
Needs Present problems and challenges
Inadequate funds to extend revolving loans to needy women groups so as to economically empower them and reduce the risks of them falling in the hands of their abusers because of lack of access to food and other basic needs.  By linking vocational and entrepreneurial education, women not only receive practical instruction on how to produce, but also acquire the business skills needed to earn themselves a living. The production and sale of products that this entails generates income which women are able to use to support their households. This focus on financial sustainability means that every money invested in developing women economic and entrepreneurship capacity at community level will continues to have an impact year after year.
The need to build women’s financial base capacity and create new livelihoods is critical for the peaceful development of any developing country such as Uganda. I hope that our approach inspires your trust to share that vision, and to invest in the future of women as the best approach of changing and improving household incomes and access to basic needs of these community women.
Access to credit, Basic skills Education and training are fundamental tools of empowerment. They provide the poor and disadvantaged women with the means to increase their productivity and income earning power. Education and training can enhance the bargaining power of community women; foster assertiveness and self-confidence; promote greater awareness of legal and social rights; and improve access to and use of economic resources such as jobs, land, credit, and information.  Access to credit, Basic skills Education and training programs are geared towards transformation and structural adjustments of community women economic independence, which increases their control over decisions, resources and structures affecting their lives. In this way, education creates conditions for full and equal participation of people in discussions and decisions, and at the same time empowers all people to act for change.
Lack of proper documentation of the project progress mainly because we lack computers to store the data. Most of the information on beneficiaries, loans, savings and current status of businesses is stored on papers

AYWD Uganda Scheme / Group Lending Methodology:
This Revolving Fund lending program is based on group lending methodology where needy solidarity groups of 10 women form a borrowing group, but each person has her own business to start or run.  The group members co-guarantee each other’s loans.  There is no collateral, as the poor women lack assets to stake for the loans.  But the group members use peer pressure to ensure loan repayments are done on time and in full.  A built-in saving scheme enables the poor women grasp the essence of savings and to experience a process of financial discipline.  These Savings are handled and managed within and by group members and their group leaders.   The groups are encouraged to open up Bank Accounts with commercial banks of their own choice to keep this savings, before they are transferred to us for custody.  Business counselling and training continues throughout the loan term provided by Group Mentors and Field Officers.
 

 
AYWD Uganda teaches /trains the women groups how to make small savings every week and acquire financial discipline. This savings discipline therefore provides some level of security for the loan program. Therefore, the following conditions obtain under our Credit Extension program:


Ownership:

The beneficiaries identify and plan the businesses themselves and receive advice from AYWD Uganda on the best practices to maximise returns
 



Local Resources:

The Women group member secure their loan, plus those who can access land for agricultural business projects very well and good.
 




Time and Energy:
 


They each work a minimum of 6 hours per day on their project businesses.
 




Self-sufficiency            :
 


They anticipate a profit.
 



Reinvestment 
They invest at least 20% of the profit in the enterprise.


Growth
They anticipate a continuing and expanding level of Self-employment.


Domestic consumption
They use at least 30% of the net profits into buying and providing nutritious foods and a balanced diet to their children / families/households.


Accountability              
They report on their businesses and its results


 
The loan beneficiaries submit a business plan which is first appraised at group level before being sent to our organisation for appraisal before receiving the first cycle of loan of US$ 100. They receive the second cycle of loans after submitting a business report, which demonstrates that they have kept records, have established viable enterprises and met program requirements.  The clients continue to save in order to qualify for the next higher loan in the next cycle.  Loan periods are between 4 to 6 months.  A minimal interest rate of 3% per month is charged on the loans to enable the program meet its operational costs and to address the need for sustainability strategy and expand its capital base to serve more new members. 15 organised groups have been identified by our Field Staff and need refresher capacity building /training and later credit extension.  A total of 150 women form the 15 groups for which the grant is sought.
 

 
This Credit Program is to provide low-income women especially victims of Domestic Violence, single mothers living with HIV/AIDS, the opportunity to establish profitable micro-businesses (agricultural and non-agricultural) and increase their incomes, helping them to meet their families’ basic needs.  In addition, they develop organizational, leadership, entrepreneurial, financial management skills, the ability to save and re-invest, and increased confidence in themselves and their future.
Performance of Group Lending Methodology:
AYWD Uganda has been conveniently and efficiently providing these women with psycho-social support, training in basic life skills, financial and business management, agricultural business practices with a value chain approach. The organization is reaching a significant number of the poor marginalized women and victims of Domestic Violence, however there is a high demand for financial capital (micro-credit services for these women).  Hence a need to have more capital resources to step up these women economic empowerment through access to credit.
Use for which the funds are requested:
The grant component we want funding for is primarily for providing Revolving Fund to marginalized Women Groups, refresher training, logistics and publication of 500 copies to be sold and revenue used to increase the organizations capacity to reach more widows. Capacity building and training will be carried out in the following areas:

In Group Management / Group dynamics
In entrepreneurial skills development
In micro-projects investment/Business management
In Book-keeping skills and
Those with agricultural projects (value addition)

Loans will then be extended to these women groups hence economically, socially empowering them and further building their capacity to provide for their families. The grant support will help increase self-respect and esteem among the local women and hence liberating them economically, physically, and socially.
 

 
Beneficiaries of the anticipated grant project funds:
The beneficiaries will be 150 poor rural / needy women in Wakiso District.
Intended benefits to the beneficiaries:

Building capacity in skills such as entrepreneurial/business management skills, leadership skills.
Empowering beneficiaries economically towards self-sufficiency to enable beneficiaries generate enough income for their households.
Social emancipation of rural women (they will learn leadership skills and group organisation and management) to enable them participates fully in the social and economic life of this country.
Acquisition of literacy and functional skills, credit with education will equip functional skills and literacy skills to needy women since this will be incorporated as a training component.  They will be able now to identify, buy or grow and provide nutritious foods for their children to combat malnutrition and marasmus and feed a balanced diet to their households.
They will mobilise savings, build and internalise a culture of savings and develop financial discipline through systematic and spontaneous savings under the credit programme.
Young women with no capital or incomes who would otherwise resort to a life of crime, prostitution would now become economically productive and escape temptations of promiscuity and risking HIV/AIDS as well as surviving fall back in to abusive relationships.
At least by the end of the 2 years each woman should have her own plot of land and a one or two-bedroom house.

Resource Requirements:

Funds are required for the Revolving Loan facilitation, training to 150 rural women in 15 groups.
Funds for logistical support, such as for training venues, accommodation for facilitators, meals, refreshments, transport, fuel, stationery, typesetting, typing and printing, photocopying, and binding workshop materials.
Procurement of 5 laptops for proper documentation of activities, outcomes, outputs of the project and storage of current and previous data
Funds to publish 500 books titled the plight of widows in Uganda and their fatherless children to sale to raise revenue for the organizations outreach to other widows.

 

 
In addition to grant support, the following sources will also be considered to sustain the programme.

Internal sources such as retained earnings and surplus from the lending program will need to be ploughed back, to increase the loan portfolio / capital base.
In addition, external sources of funds such as soft loans and commercial loans will also be used to finance the planned development.
Earnings from the sale of 500 books which will increase the number of beneficiaries served and skilled.

Source of our present funds
Our organization has been able to get some funding and or logistical support from the following sources:

Local savings from members – locally mobilised savings
Board members’ contributions.

Movement towards financial independence
Our staff are already trained in Micro-finance best practices and loan tracking systems.  In addition, government policy which favours decentralization of services and the setting up of village banks, rural credit schemes and micro-finance institutions have greatly favoured our operations.  The passing of the Micro-Financing Bill into a law will greatly favours Micro-Finance operations in the country.
Project self-sustainability
Our micro-credit program is projected to fully reach self-sufficiency by December 2021 in two (2) years’ time.  An increased clientele will mean more interest revenue for the program, which will contribute to a growing revolving fund and a reduced cost per unit of loan lent.  Measures to be taken to reduce long-term dependence on grants and subsidies will include re-capitalizing our loan portfolio by ploughing back interest earned from the loan-lending program. With our growth plan, we are fully set to become self-sustainable by the end of the year 2021 and to attain operational efficiency at the beginning of June 2021.
 

 
A loan loss reserve fund of 5% of the loan portfolio will be set aside to insure any bad debts.  This money will be put on a Fixed Deposit Account at a Commercial Bank to earn us a fixed deposit interest rate of 5% per month.  As a measure to safeguard against bad debts.  Then we plan to take an Insurance Policy and Insurance Program for women group loans with a local Insurance Company.  Careful loan portfolio management and loan tracking will be applied to enhance portfolio quality.  Already 5 staff have been trained in loan tracking and MFI best practices.
Our Revolving Fund program hopes to build a solid and growing fund base with clear business plans, backed by operational capacities that lead to mobilization of commercial funds from depositors and the financial system and eventually to full independence from donor support by the end of the year 2021 by generating its own income and enough to sustain the program.
Our Future plans

To expand our Revolving Fund Program to target all other marginalized women who may be in need of the support. We will continue training and sensitization, advocacy for women rights and emancipation train and to have continuous follow up.  Development programs and projects that provide women with employment. 
Document all the loan portfolio on the laptops and the success stories of all the beneficiaries. Also, setup a website for international viewing of the project progress.
Lobby and source for agricultural inputs and mechanization grants/loans to accelerate commercial farming projects for these women Group and many more.
Continue outreach programs to reach more communities.
To expand our capacity building / training program to gain more capacity by recruiting more field/ training staff.  Also to acquire more equipment for training, such as video, camera, digital camera, projector.
To introduce new products / services such as health insurance scheme (micro-care) for micro-credit clients in conjunction with relevant service providers.
To take up insurance scheme for our Revolving Fund Program so as to ensure and maximise all our local repayments to 100%.
Sale of more boos titled the plight of widows in Uganda and their fatherless children to public as a fundraising strategy.

<p>Mit den Comics möchte ich alle Interessierten einladen, sich in der Welt der LGBTI* umzusehen, ihre Lebensweise, Erfahrungen und alles, was sie bewegt, sichtbar und begreifbar machen – ganz jenseits von gängigen Klischees! </p>

<p>Mit den Comics möchte ich möglichst viele Menschen erreichen und für das Thema interessieren. Daher habe ich bereits ein Buch veröffentlicht, ein zweites folgt in Kürze. Außerdem gab es eine <strong>Posterausstellung</strong>, die schon in vielen Ländern in Europa und in Nordamerika mit großem Erfolg gezeigt wurde. Mit den Postern, die zu einem günstigen Preis zu kaufen ist, können Vereine, Schulen, Universitäten, Einrichtungen aller Art eine tolle Ausstellung machen und auf diese Weise viele Menschen erreichen.</p>

<p>Ich engagiere mich außerdem mit Lesungen und Vorträgen zu meinen Comics um noch mehr Menschen für das Thema zu interessieren. Bis zu 200 Veranstaltungen gab es in den letzten Jahren zu ""Ach, so ist das?!"".</p>
<p>Das Projekt ist auch schon mehrfach ausgezeichnet worden. Und ein Team von Pädagog_innen hat ein passendes Programm entwickelt, um mit den Comics Akzeptanz-Workshops an Schulen durchzuführen. Das haben wir inzwischen mehrfach mit großem Erfolg durchgeführt.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It’s the first project of its kind in our region. Words can't describe how important it is to me, us, society, region, country. We pray for the achievement of the goal. The success of this endeavor relies on YOU. Your involvement will help us start something necessary, special, and important.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For less than that starbucks latte, you could support the independent, community-focused journalism this region badly needs. Together, we will continue to grow this revolution. By crowdfunding here on indiegogo, we are able to stay completely independent and 100% accountable to the people who matter most – our advocates. There is urgency behind this mission. Crowdfunding allows us to move forward quickly and without financial blessing or permission from any higher institutions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The free flow of information and ideas lies at the heart of the very notion of democracy and is crucial to effective respect for human rights. Democracy demands that individuals are able to participate effectively in decision making and assess the performance of their government. With the help of  ATAMAN, we are trying to correct the imbalance. If the global community does not fight the imbalances that exist at a local level in developing countries, this epidemic can sweep the whole world! The greatest challenge isn’t one pertaining to capacity, but to fostering a shift from a culture of secrecy to one of transparency. Therefore, the promotion of a change of mindsets in the public sector and of widespread public awareness and information demand is critical.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The success of project Ataman now relies heavily on community support, so the biggest obstacle to full realization of this project would be underfunding. We expected to launch the project on our own, but miscalculated the budget a bit. Perhaps it is even better. The search for funding brought us here, and the support of the international community make it legitimate and recognizable! When we produce the Ataman, we put everything on the map, since we will not have the opportunity to return to our former life. Your help will give us extra time, helps to do things that we would not dare.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate to our cause, donate some time to sharing this important campaign to your family, friends and associates on your Facebook || Twitter || Linked-In || Instagram || Snapchat pages!</p>

<h3>It's Time For a CHANGE!!</h3>
<p>With the most recent senseless murders of innocent black lives such as Floyd Brown, Breonna Taylor, and Trayvon Martin - to name a few - the Black Community is fed up and have finally had enough. In an effort to show America that we want true change and equality for the Black man and the Black Lives Matter movement under the P.I.F.F. chapter, we are initiating the Petition for Change and the March of the 144,000 on June 30, 2020.</p>
<p>In response to the barbaric murders of Black people, brutal police killings against innocent Black lives, unfair criminal laws and unjust jail sentences designed against the Black Community, and a poor representation of equality and equal justice for the Black Community in 2020 and dating back to slavery times, the ""Voice of the Underground"" -- P.I.F.F. Magazine -- and several large organizations from all over the globe are uniting together on a common goal to establish the ""Petition for Change"" and the new P.I.F.F. Nation - where all lives are considered truly equal.</p>
<p>Under the laws and principles of the new-found P.I.F.F. Nation, the P.I.F.F. family seeks and vows to protect all of its members under provision of shelter, food, transportation, and needed resources. To establish the beginning foundation of our new community for Black Lives Matter under the P.I.F.F. chapter and the equal business platforms and industry accesses, we are asking all members to make a founding donation and BLM pledge for at least $1. For those truly seeking change in America, we are hoping to reach at least 1,000 members and raise at least $30,000 USD to initiate the beginning phases of our movement! Read below to see more about our cause.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Positive Vibes Only</h3>
<p>Sponsored by some of the biggest companies in the entertainment industry such as Wu-Tang, Def Jam Records, Select Oil, Powerhouse 106 FM, and Legal Mobb Entertainment to name a few, P.I.F.F. Magazine is the magazine that offers a promotional platform for the underground, independent, and aspiring talent. Highlighting all entertainers looking for a place in which to have their voices heard, we are the bridge between the streets and the entertainment industry that represents positive change for a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>We represent all models, music artists, comedians, poets, photographers, athletes, fashion designers, dancers, and entrepreneurs of the entertainment industry and are offering a one-time last-minute involvement in the movement before we go fully public and become a household name. Whether you're small-time, big-time, or just somebody who's interested in learning more about the entertainment industry and its business, we're supporting your dream and burning away all the nonsense while giving you some strong  </p>
<p>P.ositive I.nfluence F.or the F.uture </p>

Nation from our members to the U.S. government as we seek justice and answers in a peaceful and humble way.</p>

<p><i><strong>II. MARCH OF THE 144K (6/30/2020 - 7/4/2020):</strong></i></p>
<p>During our ""March of the 144,000"", we will call for all top leaders around America to begin the March of the 144,000 to the White House in Washington, D.C. to seek the answers and the changes that the Black Community seeks in addition to the urban community.</p>
<p>This march shall begin launchings from multiple locations spreadout across America, so that there is no central starting point in which the government can stop or shut us down. Only those who are truly a part of the movement will know where these march launches will initiate, but to everyone who is a part of the fight for change, they will know where to go at the time it shall begin.</p>
<p>We shall march 144,000+ strong to the capitol of America, also known as the White House, and we shall address the Trump administration on the equality we are searching for. When we arrive in D.C., we shall lift up the voices of the underground to address America's sins against the urban community and we shall seek valid changes as we present our ""Petition for Change"" to the U.S. government in hopes of positive change for tomorrow's generation.</p>

<p><i><strong>III. BLACKOUT DAY 2020 (7/1/2020 - 7/7/2020):</strong></i></p>
<p>During our March of the 144,000 and throughout the Blackout Day 2020, we as a community seek to not spend a single $1 to the American government. Co-signed by several large figures - including Atlanta rapper T.I. - Blackout Day will officially commence on July 7, 2020 in memory of our fallen Black soldiers including Trayvon Martin, Breonna Taylor, Floyd Brown, and several other Black lives that were terminated and exterminated as a flame that bothers those who fear its bright shine and illumination.</p>
<p>During our first annual Blackout Day in which we seek positive change and reform nationwide for the Black Lives Matter movement, we are extending our holiday to last for a week long from July 1, 2020 - July 7, 2020. The purpose of this week-long extension is to show that we mean serious business and we are NOT PLAYING with the Trump administration on our demands for change.</p>
<p>Supported by Nike, we vow to not spend a single dollar in the American economy from 7:00 AM EST on July 1, 2020 - 11:00 PM EST on July 7, 2020 to prove how important the Black dollar is within America and the affect we can make as a united community. During this timeframe, P.I.F.F. Magazine will have all business operations shut down.</p>
<p>We will not transfer any financial transactions during this week either through CashApp, PayPal, streets, etc, for we know that any transaction made in America has a middle man that leads back to the U.S. economy and therefore, goes against our fight for change; especially on July 4, also known as ""Independence Day"" for we know that nobody within the Black Community has ever been independent or treated as such in this country, nor do we believe that this is our holiday; therefore, we will not celebrate it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For far too long, the Black Community has stood silent and humble awaiting the hands of justice to treat us equally as if a poor child holding their breath on Christmas Eve in hopes of receiving a gift that they know their providers have no means of offering but on the vessel of broken promises and empty vows.</p>
<p>Abducted, kidnapped, traded, and bought from out of the depths of our true Royalty in the motherland of Africa and transformed into niggers and slaves inside an America designed against the Black man, we have gone for generation after generation of government supremacy and mass murder of extermination of the Black man, father, leader, and seed carrier as they continue to strive to use our Black women to create some type of super race that eliminates the Black father and true King.</p>
<p>Through this initiative, we seek to make a change in this broken cycle.</p>
<p>We are committed to changing at least 1,000 lives over the next 12 months and are committed to the Black Lives Matter movement and rebuilding at least 25 urban communities. Your contribution will make this change possible.</p>

</div></div>","It's Time For a CHANGE!!
With the most recent senseless murders of innocent black lives such as Floyd Brown, Breonna Taylor, and Trayvon Martin - to name a few - the Black Community is fed up and have finally had enough. In an effort to show America that we want true change and equality for the Black man and the Black Lives Matter movement under the P.I.F.F. chapter, we are initiating the Petition for Change and the March of the 144,000 on June 30, 2020.
In response to the barbaric murders of Black people, brutal police killings against innocent Black lives, unfair criminal laws and unjust jail sentences designed against the Black Community, and a poor representation of equality and equal justice for the Black Community in 2020 and dating back to slavery times, the ""Voice of the Underground"" -- P.I.F.F. Magazine -- and several large organizations from all over the globe are uniting together on a common goal to establish the ""Petition for Change"" and the new P.I.F.F. Nation - where all lives are considered truly equal.
Under the laws and principles of the new-found P.I.F.F. Nation, the P.I.F.F. family seeks and vows to protect all of its members under provision of shelter, food, transportation, and needed resources. To establish the beginning foundation of our new community for Black Lives Matter under the P.I.F.F. chapter and the equal business platforms and industry accesses, we are asking all members to make a founding donation and BLM pledge for at least $1. For those truly seeking change in America, we are hoping to reach at least 1,000 members and raise at least $30,000 USD to initiate the beginning phases of our movement! Read below to see more about our cause.
 
Positive Vibes Only
Sponsored by some of the biggest companies in the entertainment industry such as Wu-Tang, Def Jam Records, Select Oil, Powerhouse 106 FM, and Legal Mobb Entertainment to name a few, P.I.F.F. Magazine is the magazine that offers a promotional platform for the underground, independent, and aspiring talent. Highlighting all entertainers looking for a place in which to have their voices heard, we are the bridge between the streets and the entertainment industry that represents positive change for a better tomorrow.
We represent all models, music artists, comedians, poets, photographers, athletes, fashion designers, dancers, and entrepreneurs of the entertainment industry and are offering a one-time last-minute involvement in the movement before we go fully public and become a household name. Whether you're small-time, big-time, or just somebody who's interested in learning more about the entertainment industry and its business, we're supporting your dream and burning away all the nonsense while giving you some strong

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>PositiveNets was developed by a team of entrepreneurs and was recently winner of TechStars Weekend Long Island sponsored by Google. </p>
<p>PositiveNets aims to be an online platform that allows you to interact and donate to homeless individuals through the convenience of your mobile device.  In an ever increasing cashless world homeless people are finding themselves left out the cold when it comes to cash donations; it is estimated that only one of three New Yorkers carry physical cash on them.</p>
<p>With PositiveNets homeless people can register for a digital code with their local social worker.  The homeless individual can then share their digital code with the general public which directs users to their online profile.   Users can then read the individuals profile page, background story and established goals and donate to them if they choose.</p>
<p>Donors can feel confident that money is going towards established goals to their path out of poverty, as their digital donation is loaded on to a pre-paid debit card that is only valid at approved vendors.  Donors can also feel confident that 100% of their contribution go towards the homeless individuals road to financial stability.</p>
<p>By contributing to the PositiveNets project you can now digitally help the millions of homeless people around the world reconnect with their local community over a digital platform while also helping raise them out of poverty through words of encouragement and digital donations toward their established goals.</p>

<p>We plan to work with volunteers to help assist us on-board homeless shelters and social workers in identifying and creating profiles on the platform.  We have secured a strategic partnership with <a href=""https://www.idpass.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ID Pass</a> to provide an identity through a decentralized identification solution to the most vulnerable populations.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am writing this book to help families who have just entered into this nightmare. I have seen the way our family courts and child protective services have eroded over the 25 years I have been involved with them. This will be the first of several books that I will self publish to help families like yours around the world. I will include other stories that families have had to go through. This book will be my current fight to save my grandchildren and will include numerous documents to prove that this is about money not what is in the best interest of the child. How our family courts are meant to be fair and balanced but are not. How judges allow lies and falsified records into the courts and how they ignore the truth because you child is for sale for bonus money. I will explain the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act and how it has put a price tag on your child's head. My book will have stories of how when the children are removed they almost never want to place them with families and how they prefer strangers for placement. This is real. Awareness is very important because there will never be a shortage of children and families lives to destroy.</p>

<h3>EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL FAMILIES</h3>
<p>Since 2012 the International Family Equality Day (IFED) takes place every year the first Sunday in May to celebrate LGBTIQ* families all over the world. It is an awareness day that celebrates the beauty and richness of family diversity and furthers equality for everyone. Too often children with LGBTIQ* parents cannot enjoy the same rights as children in traditional families. That is why IFED increases our visibility and empowers our communities around the world.<br/><br/>The IFED annual report highlights the activities that were held in the different countries to celebrate this day. Your donation will contribute to the printing of the report, an important tool for our advocacy activities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>FAMILIES: UNITED WE STAND</h3>
<p>IFED was a source of strength and motivation to stand up for equal rights for all families. We stand united within our families, sharing love, care and commitment to create an environment where every member can feel safe and flourish. We stand united with all types of families, because every family deserves equal recognition, support and respect. We stand united with our communities, to celebrate and enjoy together the beauty and richness of family diversity. We stand united with our allies: cities, organizations, institutions, and all those working with us for a more open and diverse society. We stand united across the countries, to share the joy of our celebrations and to support those who can’t yet safely be out to celebrate.</p>

<h3>HOW TO STRENGTHEN LGBTQ* FAMILIES</h3>
<p>The International Family Equality Day Report 2019 will be used as a practical tool to address lobbying strategies and as a means to strengthen the visibility of rainbow families around the world. It can be used to forge alliances with other family organisations as well as with policymakers and the authorities towards the goal of recognition for all families. The collective solidarity should be strengthened in collaboration with different family forms because together, we are strong.</p>

For every $1 dollar you donate this will provide 10 meals to families in need and for every $10 dollars this will provide 100 meals. Any amount will help struggling families in need. Poverty and hunger in America41 million people struggle with hunger in the United States. Help us reach those that rely on our 300 Food Banks throughout the US including 14 million children and 6.4 million seniors who struggle to afford enough to eat.I know in my heart we can do this we are the richest Nation in the World. I expect us to reach our goal and surpass it 2 times over or at least I’ll pray for this that would be an amazing 30 million meals. Hunger threatens our nationIn The United States, 1 in 7 people struggles with hunger. Children and adults face hunger in every community across the country.Your neighbor, child’s classmate or even coworker may be struggling to get enough to eat. Many people facing hunger are forced to make tough choices between buying food and medical bills, food and rent and/or food and transportation. This struggle goes beyond harming an individual family’s future, it can harm us all. According to a study conducted in 2016, 72 billion pounds of food are wasted in America each year.Partner with us help provide Needed Food to U.S. families in America. The World is watching lets prove we are “One Nation under God”""PITCH IN AGAINST HUNGER 2018""All donations raised go directly into serving the people in need at local U.S. Food Banks. When we come together, we have more power. We will provide daily updates on how many meals we are providing to local U.S. food banks. Please help by sharing our story: PITCH IN AGAINST HUNGER 2018  Local U.S. Food Banks Need our Help
 
 
5 Additional ways you can Help Fight Local Hunger1. Educate YourselfKnowledge is power, but to be aware is not enough. We need to challenge ourselves to not look the other direction, but rather to take action to address food insecurity issues. There are so many small things that can be done that will add up to make a huge difference. Learn hunger facts, read inspirational quotes, and find a detailed reading list full of books and websites, for people of all different ages, to learn more about hunger. 2. Volunteer at Local Food Bank or PantryMany volunteers find it exceptionally rewarding to help families with children or elderly family members who are struggling to provide healthy food for those who need it most. Many of these people are faced with tough decisions on where to spend their money on a low-income budget. Contact agencies in your community who provide food for the hungry. By volunteering at a food bank, you’ll be able to help families use their money to pay their bills and other expenses while still having access to healthy foods. Locate a food bank here: https://godslifematters.org/u-s-local-food-banks/
3. Prayer and Church
Reach into your heart and be thankful for the riches God has provided our country, and pray for those who do not always have access to this abundant food. Pray for guidance as you seek to be a part of the solution to our nations hunger problems. Give an extra dollar or two during the church offering this will go into helping families in your local community.
 
 4. Write to Your Legislator 
Email, write, or call your members of Congress urge them to address the food-insecurity issues in your local communities. You can sign an online petition urging Congress to help end hunger for the families who struggle to put food on the table. There are many of us fighting hunger now in America and we can use all the help you bring.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Nargiz is a 21-year-old transgender woman, a refugee from Azerbaijan. ‘It’s very dangerous’ she says of being transgender in her home country. But the danger is now a memory from the past, as she has been able to express herself freely mostly without violence from Georgian society, she says.</p>
<p>She has never seen her father; her mother put her into care when she was only three. She was beaten when she told her foster mother she is transgender. Boys would beat her too, telling her she’d burn in hell.</p>
<p>‘Once I was beaten near the house; they took my phone. When I appealed to the police for help they asked me whether I was a fag. This is why people like me are afraid to ask for help in Azerbaijan. There is no one to help transgender people. That’s why many turn to sex work. Nobody cares. Even local LGBT organisations tell you to “walk like a man, like a normal person, and people will not say anything” ’, says Nargiz.</p>
<p>After coming of age she left the care home. She used to deliver books and would sleep at her office. She tried to get a job in Turkey, but failed. She was planning to go to a Western European country, but eventually came to Georgia and decided to stay.</p>
<p>Nargiz hopes to obtain a university degree and become a lawyer.</p>
<p>‘My mum called once. “Is it painful?” she asked mockingly, as if I were a sex worker. Transgender women in Azerbaijan, even as children, they think about becoming sex workers when they grow up. I want to become a lawyer and prove everyone wrong. Everybody thinks all transgender people can do is a sex work.’</p>
<p>She is hopeful that someday life will change for better for queer people in Azerbaijan. ‘I hope someday they will be free and happy’, says Nargiz.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Almost a half century ago the Young Lords Organization emerged in Chicago to prevent the displacement of the Latinx community from Lincoln Park and fight for the self-determination of Puerto Rico.  Rooted in their family histories of migration, the YLO exemplified the Third World revolutionary activism that developed in many communities of color across the United States during the late sixties.  Inspired by national liberation struggles and firmly aligned with the politics of the Black Panther Party, the YLO set up community service programs, resisted police violence, anchored the Original Rainbow Coalition, and disrupted urban removal plans for Lincoln Park.  Due to their ideology, organizing courage, and cultural resistance, the Young Lords Organization of Chicago soon influenced the creation of Young Lords chapters in other cities.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will have a direct impact on maintaining the historical memory of the Young Lords.  Indeed, the 50th anniversary of the Young Lords Organization offers an important opportunity to revisit the revolutionary history of the YLO and to remember the Young Lords who were lost in struggle.  Mindful that Puerto Rico remains a U.S. colony and that displacement and police violence continue to harm Latinx communities in Chicago and beyond, the 50th anniversary of the YLO is also a chance to reflect upon the political lessons the history of the YLO offers to organizers facing intense challenges today.  Indeed, as the history of the Young Lords challenges narrow Black/White frameworks of U.S. racial domination, contributes to traditions of Third World socialism, and is filled with powerful examples of women and Afro-Latinx leadership, it provides political clarity to many emerging communities of resistance.</p>

All funds will go directly to the Young Lords and will be spent on 50th Anniversary initiatives.  
 

The Impact
Your donation will have a direct impact on maintaining the historical memory of the Young Lords.  Indeed, the 50th anniversary of the Young Lords Organization offers an important opportunity to revisit the revolutionary history of the YLO and to remember the Young Lords who were lost in struggle.  Mindful that Puerto Rico remains a U.S. colony and that displacement and police violence continue to harm Latinx communities in Chicago and beyond, the 50th anniversary of the YLO is also a chance to reflect upon the political lessons the history of the YLO offers to organizers facing intense challenges today.  Indeed, as the history of the Young Lords challenges narrow Black/White frameworks of U.S. racial domination, contributes to traditions of Third World socialism, and is filled with powerful examples of women and Afro-Latinx leadership, it provides political clarity to many emerging communities of resistance.

<p>I would like to start off by telling you a little about myself. My name is Joey Rivers.  I served 8 years in the Army National Guard and a Veteran of the Iraq Campaign with two tours. Currently, I am a employee for Permaletter Sign Company in Billings MT.  I have three energetic children and a wife who really deserves the credit when I was deployed.</p>
<p>  The reason I am writing to you is that we are looking for some help on accomplishing a goal.  As a strong supporter of disabled vets and military personnel, we want to wrap a 1969 Mustang to Tribute to soldiers.  The reason we choose this method is that it is affordable and also does not damage the original paint. The tribute mustang will be wrapped in 3M 1080-brushed black met aluminum with carbon fiber accents. This design will signify the strength of U.S. military and United States through good and bad.  Accomplishing this goal, we will be able to use the 1969 Mustang to raise funds at car shows, foundations, and other charitable events for fallen and injured soldiers of our country.  This will help support such charities like (Operation Never Forgotten, Disable American Vets, Big Sky Honor Flight, as well as other charities of any.) Web sites listed below.</p>
<p>I am a wrap artist for a local sign company. Therefore, cost of labor is zero.  The Funds are strictly to pay for the wrapping materials I need (at my cost).  This makes it even cheaper.  The material is 1080 3m wrapping compliant material with life like texture.  It is know to last 7 to 10 years if taken care of. The cost of this project in a shop would be around $4000.00!!</p>
<p>Supporting a family of five is a very hard task on top of trying to do things for me. I always put the family first and this donation will be strictly for my goal.   Thank you for your time.</p>

<h3>Help I am Seeking</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am seeking the funds to mass produce the Protest Plates in order to sell them as inexpensively as possible. The cost of making an injection mold is $5,000. In addition, there are set-up and cleaning fees for every run. $20,000 will pay for the engineering and manufacturing of the injection mold. It will pay for the set-up and clean-up fees and pay for the first 1,000 pairs of mass-produced units.</li>
<li>The first 10 people who send $22, will get 1, handmade by me, Protest Plate. Maybe it will become a souvenir? There will be a lot of love in it. </li>
<li>The next 1,000 people who send $20 will receive the first 1,000 pairs. Those people will also get the satisfaction of knowing that future protesters can get a pair for around $5 once the injection mold and engineering are paid for. </li>
<li>Any funds in excess will be used to send free pairs to all the bloggers, new media journalists and website operators who help red-pill and inform the masses. I know how hard it is to create media. I know hard it is to get in front of a camera. I want to thank everyone I mentioned and hundreds of others that we collectively identify.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Imagine What Could Be</h3>
<p>Your help could crystalize the movement that is ready to explode. This is a non-violent to communicate what we profess to believe in a very public way.</p>
<ul>
<li>I feel the sense of anger, frustration and powerlessness expressed by constitutionalists like me. I am hoping to give people a way to stand up, be counted and push back.</li>
<li>I have successfully started 10 companies in a variety of fields from media production to biotech.</li>
<li>In March 2017, I helped organize a successful protest at the White House against Pizzagate and anti-child trafficking. Every year I produce the stage event for Rolling Thunder in front of the Lincoln Memorial on Memorial Day to support veterans. I am a dreamer and a doer.</li>
<li>Today I want to do something to help change the world.</li>
<li>I believe this campaign can morph into something far bigger and I am ready to help lead it. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is apathy. Apathy is what fuels the deepstate. They constantly pound us with memes that reinforce the false sense of powerlessness. Stop buying their BS and do something</p>
<ul>
<li>We are far more powerful than we know. We are the ones we've been waiting for!</li>
<li>Instead of being frightened by police officers and other citizens, it is time those of us that have been red-pilled help others come to understand that the 99.9% are all on the same team. If not us then Who?</li>
<li>There are no knights in shining armor ready to march into DC and save us. That's our job.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Many Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The deepstate will be watching this campaign. If you don't have $20, send $1. The point is displaying the willingness to stand up and be counted.  This is not about making money. This is about making a statement. We can use your voice and vote brothers and sisters. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you have some basic skills, make your own Protest Plate. Its possible to glue other words on the louvers of the plates so the cameras read a far different message than numbers on a plate. I'll explain later.</li>
<li>If anything I have said resonates with you, please spread this message. </li>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Ryan. I like writing poetry, specifically Haikus. One year ago, I started creating ""Fraikus"" (Friday Haikus) and shared my written pieces with friends and colleagues. Now, I'm going global. I want to share my art with you while helping to make a difference in the world.</p>
<h3>Where Will Funding Go &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Apart from the platform fees tied to using Indiegogo, <strong>all funds raised will go to</strong> <strong>World Vision Canada</strong> in support of their mission to helping families and communities in developing countries.</p>
<p>We have many rewards available. Check them out, I think you'll be very excited.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll be supporting a global organization that's making a difference in the lives of others. In return, you'll receive a unique poem, or several of them, from a renowned Haiku artist - me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Sometimes I'll get writer's block, which could cause some delay in delivering your Haiku on time. I will do everything in my power to ensure it arrives in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Other times, you might not like the Haiku you received. If you are unsatisfied with the quality of the poem composed for you, I will send you another Haiku at no added cost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. Share this campaign with your friends and family using the Indiegogo share tools. Every little bit helps. Together, we can do our part in shaping the world for the better.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>This project was successfully funded on Kickstarter on the 13th of May.  The kindest 606 souls helped me raise $77,000 for the project of a lifetime. As we are talking about a lifetime, there is tons of work to be done on the property. And you can help me create the most kindest destination in Croatia. You can still book nights in treehouses with promotional prices only on Indiegogo InDemand! Or plant a tree, adopt one from the forest, sponsor a birdhouse or help me build the</p>
<p> glass greenhouse! Power to the forest!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE DREAM</h2>
<p>We are on a mission to build an environmentally and socially conscious retreat with treehouses, like no other. Secluded within the pristine forests of Rastoke, Croatia, Tree Elements greets travelers and shelter-seekers with equal respect.</p>
<p>Creating the kindest treehouse eco-retreat in the world and devoting ourselves to the forest while giving back to the people and to Mother Nature, the retreat will be built with locally sourced materials. Life at Tree Elements is a story of community and conservation of natural and cultural heritage. Help us make our dream come true!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620739963/i2buy5kgfvb1fkd4q9yp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>HOW IT ALL STARTED</strong></h3>
<p>In 2018 I bought 7 acres/ 28,000m2 of forest land near Rastoke village by Korana river in Croatia. There was nothing on the property except an old house from 1906, a small barn, and one gorgeous linden tree.  The moment I saw the property I knew this was the place where I wanted to create something magical, where I wanted to grow my roots. The proximity of the most beautiful national park in the country - Plitvice Lakes, was just an added bonus. </p>
<p>I've dreamt of creating a zero-waste, plastic-free, treehouse retreat for a long time. The result is Tree Elements, a labor of love, passion, and dedication. But there’s more: I dream of redefining the concept of travel. Not promoting mass tourism, but proposing an ecological, sustainable, and socially aware way to explore and enjoy travel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620740262/wexdnpbmiob0xnk857sb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I welcome both travelers and organizations that help those in need.</p>
<p>Now, me and my family are so close to turning the whole property into a zero-waste, zero-plastic retreat and a holistic center called ""Tree Elements"".<br/>Wooden treehouses named Earth, Water &amp; Wind are all secluded inside the forest, together with the new main house -the gathering place representing the Ether elementand a renovated barn, now a small farmhouse, the Fire element.</p>

<p>I am a young girl with an old soul, hanging from a tree, completely in love with them, with nature and life, a huge fighter for justice, for people, and for Mother Earth.</p>
<p>The idea of what I want to do with my life, truly and fully, came to me when I was, luckily, only 28. It was crystal clear: change my career, buy a forest, build treehouses and come up with something new, something kind.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620740331/fukhrvmjzc97fdgv97il.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I got my first job in tourism when I was 15 and since then I was saving money like a little squirrel. I have been working and observing the industry for 17 years now, from selling souvenirs, being a cleaning lady, doing PR, working as a waiter, bartender, to working at the hotel's front desks. From working in hostels and managing apartments, to being a guest in numerous places as a tour guide, I knew that this was not the path I was willing to follow because tourism desperately needs improving. I wanted something more, something different and something that could change people’s lives. I wanted to change the way how tourism works and thinks!</p>
<p>That is why I aim to create the kindest eco-retreat in the world, in the middle of Croatia, to devote myself to this forest, to nature, and to the people. All of this with immense help and support from my family and friends. </p>
<h3><b>RETREAT YOURSELF</b></h3>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620740428/mioy8tnhah28sk1fd11j.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p>
<p>Do you want to get away from everything? Yet, be connected to everything? </p>
<p>In Tree Elements, you can rent a treehouse, or even the whole property and get married in the forest. You can participate in workshops and find inspiration and in yoga, meditation, and healing retreats or make your own retreat. You can come with your team and do a team-building session, shoot a movie, a music video,  or volunteer and educate... And plant trees in your sleep!</p>
<p>There are endless possibilities. As my love for this project is. It has been for years now.</p>
<p>I am not here to promote mass tourism, I am here to propose a new concept of it for which I've coined the term 'eco-kind', meaning, in addition to being ecological and sustainable in the 21st century, we should be also socially aware of the time we live in and be kind to people. </p>
<p>By staying in our eco-kind retreat, you can help those members of society who might need to heal in this forest the most. You will be promoting environmentally aware travel while being kind to others. </p>
<p>So we have partnered with organizations that help cancer survivors, abused women, and children with malignant diseases. By inviting them to stay on the property for free and giving them the chance to participate in a variety of workshops and retreats, we want to help them heal from trauma in this magical forest and provide a home away from home. </p>
<p>We aspire to inspire other business owners to follow the idea. So far, the media houses in Croatia and abroad have recognized the value of the project, for which we are more than grateful and we hope this will have an immense impact on other businesses. </p>

<h3><b>HOME AMONG THE TREES</b></h3>
<p>The retreat will be open 365 days a year, from August 2021, offering all of you a chance to visit whenever you can. Imagine waking up in a custom-made bed in the middle of the forest, in a treehouse of your choice. Shepherd Nicola is passing by you with his sheep while you are going to the main house for breakfast. If you are not in the mood of leaving your nest, you can have breakfast delivered to you. Now, you might want to go for a walk down to the river for a swim, meditate a bit on a meadow and read a good book you have borrowed from the central library in the main house. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621243369/r8zuxp19guhjjskhu3tf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Then, you would like to cook something yummy so you visit the organic garden, pick your own fruits and veggies and hang out with domestic animals. Later on, you might want to participate in yoga, meditation &amp; healing programs, maybe attend a workshop, go on a hike, visit the National Park Plitvice Lakes or get a bike and enjoy numerous activities in the region.  Or you rented the whole property and got married! CONGRATULATIONS!</p>
<p>All of it while helping others with your stay and planting trees in your sleep! </p>

<p>We need to build a village! A village of treehouses! And you get to be among the first ones to visit. Or anytime in the future, for that manner. Just come and visit us! Or you can get something for our Mother Nature, by planting a tree, sponsoring a birdhouse, or simply he</p>
<p><b>TREEHOUSES EARTH, WATER &amp; WIND</b></p>

<p>Imagine a place where you can rent more than a treehouse. Where you get a lifestyle while giving back. </p>
<p>When promising peace &amp; quiet, it is important to deliver precisely that. That’s why there are only 3 treehouses for you to rent: Earth, Water &amp; Wind, representing the elements of Nature. </p>
<p>You will be high in the air since all of them are almost 3 m (9 feet) above the ground, while the highest point is set on 9 m (18  feet). All of them will be built with wood and glass all coming from Croatian producers. The exterior is the same, while the interiors change according to the element they represent, so each one has a story to tell through interesting details and colors.</p>
<p>All of them have been designed to take advantage of passive cooling and heating with heat pumps, thus reducing the need for air-conditioning. ""Push"" valves, water-saving showerheads, and low flush toilet systems will be installed to preserve water while rainwater will be collected for watering the garden, flushing toilets, washing the clothes, and general household cleaning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620739773/flmjauj2affvm3djhil7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The size of each treehouse is 25 m2 (260ft2), all containing living space, a fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom on one floor, while the gallery (13m2/139ft2) features a king-size bed. It can fit 4 people (with a custom-made pullout sofa). The living room opens out to a lovely wooden terrace through beautiful glass doors. Under each treehouse, we will have a decorated space for you to relax on hammocks, while the communal space will be in the main house and in front of it, under this big linden tree.</p>

<p><b>FIRE ELEMENT - the small farmhouse</b></p>
<p>This will be my home for the beginning. It was supposed to be a wood workshop but since we lack funds to furnish the main house, and since I need to supervise the construction until August, I need to be there. I want to start working on the farm as soon as possible, once this little guy is built. So we have decided to renovate the old barn into a small farmhouse that will also serve as accommodation in near future for different retreats and occasions<b>.</b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621244887/aiakjismye1kbe1yubbw.jpg"" src=""""/></b></p>

<p>The wood workshop will come, hopefully, with your help. Some funds we raise here can create a place where we would educate people about the importance of wood and natural materials. We want it to be an inspirational space and a place where, with local wood makers, we can create magic for the forest and more.<br/> </p>
<p><b>ETHER ELEMENT - the main house and the gathering place</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620740639/etxraerldxbj6shlvt2g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The five elements theory existed in many ancient cultures such as Greek, Japanese, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and more. The fifth element on top of the earth, air, fire, and water, is space or aether. The Ether element is the space in which everything happens. </p>
<p>So is this house, a place in which it all happens. Place of gatherings, of the people - all of you who visit or help in any way and leave a part of yourself here.  Here, you will attend workshops and numerous programs and meet me, my family, other travelers, or simply enjoy a home-cooked meal... You may also rent the house and the whole property, having the forest just for yourself.</p>
<p>It will hold a central library under the wooden stairs filled with local green guides, inspirational and motivational books, books about nature, food, novels… </p>

<h2>
<br/><b>HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED AND WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?</b>
</h2>
<p>Starting from scratch, without any infrastructure... it is expensive, to say the least. I've spent all of my personal savings (including my parents and my sister's).  From 2018, the money went for land,  road, water and electricity, rainwatertanks, bio sewage tanks, heat pumps for heating and cooling, organic garden, construction of the small farmhouse, foundations for everything, steel construction, architects, paperwork, and a deposit for the construction of the treehouses with the main house (20%). The rest 80% is covered with the loan from the bank, but not enough to finish all of this. They started to build the first prefabricated house in May, 2021.</p>
<div>I was ready to take the leap already in 2020 and then She showed up. Corona came, I lost my job as a tour guide, lost my income and a possibility to get an investment loan which completely changed my plans... This is when my parents and my sister got financially involved with loaning the money for foundations, steel construction, and bio sewage tanks.Without their help, I would be deep down. Deeper than Adele, believe me.  Now, all eyes are on me to finish this battle. By backing this project I will have the funds for the interior decoration and a bit of exterior.</div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pMNMlhLdLmo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p> Due to the unfortunate situation in the tourism industry caused by the spread of Coronavirus the banks were not investing in tourism-related projects.</p>
<p>If Corona did not happen, I would easily get the investment loan with the amount needed things would be much different. So after 10 different banks refused my application for the investment and 16 months of battle against windmills, I was finally able to get a loan to cover all the construction, but not enough amount.  So what now?</p>
<p>You need to sleep in a bed, right? You need a nice kitchen to cook some lovely fresh meals? Do you need a sofa to sit and watch outside? Sure thing you do.</p>

<br/><b>YOU are the key</b>

<p>YOU can help me finish make my dream come true by Aug 2021. $35,000 would go directly into the interior of the treehouses. Things like kitchens, beds, bathroom equipment and so on would be funded from your support, so they are ready for your visit.</p>
<p>Other rewards would be for the exterior. Not only for this property (wood workshop, pathways) but for Her.  Mother Nature.  After all, it is Her property.</p>
<p>Think homes for the birds while planting more and more trees, a rich organic forest garden, and then magic! Wooden benches with inspirational thoughts, art sculptures made by local designers, and a glasshouse with herbs and spices...</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown;</p>
<p>$30,000 - interior works for three guest treehouses </p>
<p>$15,000 - interior works for the main house</p>
<p>$30,000 - exterior and landscaping</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621260265/lxmgtrysx4rtcgikg008.jpg"" src=""""/><div> </div>
<p>More funds received would go into the landscaping, plus things such as a pathway to the river, a decent chicken coop, a yoga amphitheater, irrigation system, wooden deck for the main house, more domestic animals, a tool shed, glass greenhouse,  little spots around the forest to unwind and so many unexpected expenses.</p>

<h2>
<br/>THE IMPACT</h2>
<p>We want for a traveler to develop a growing sense of one another, our world, and our place in it. Yes, there should be a connection between the traveler and the local community with the environment but the purchase of something should have an impact locally &amp; directly as well as morally. Why not supporting eco-kind businesses and change the tourism industry?</p>
<p>A retreat where all the furniture comes from local designers, all the products are bought from little producers who are making a difference, where food comes from the organic garden or neighboring farms and your stay supports planting trees around Croatia!</p>
<p><b>PLANT TREES IN YOUR SLEEP</b></p>
<p>We are proud to have partners as ""Zasadi stablo, ne budi panj""(""Plant a tree, don't be a stump""), an environmental non-profit association responsible for the (r)evolution of collective planting in Croatia. It started from one week of planting trees last year to the whole month of March of this year. With the help of 55,000 volunteers, they have planted more than 150,000 trees. And that number is growing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620740846/mqnizspkiyrornanbxwz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want to be part of that number, on a large scale. This is our way to give back to Mother Nature. In these times when She needs it the most.</p>
<p>With the help of our partners, we will plant trees provided by Tree Elements. How? Simple.</p>
<p>Each stay = 1 tree planted.  A little forest revolution.</p>
<p>Ok, not so simple. Since we are doing something nobody has done before. At least not in this country. Your pledge for planting trees will help plant and grow the first Miyawaki forest in Croatia!! It is a technique pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, that helps build dense, native forests and ensures plant growth 10 times faster and 30 times denserthan usual. It involves planting native species in the same area and becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. </p>
<p>By staying with us you can show what a responsible and sustainable travel destination is, away from the masses, while being ecologically and socially aware of the time we live in. The essence should be the interaction, not only a transaction.</p>
<p>Make forests, not war! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621283512/qiqympuigq0vmj2uqgfx.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p><strong>ECO - KIND TOURISM </strong></p>
<p>The idea of - tourism for all - is reflected in giving the treehouses for free, to users of different organizations around the country who help abused women, children, and cancer patients... In the 21 century, the emphasis is on the environment and sustainability but what if it could include social input as well? Being kind to one another? So we have decided to partner with organizations ""Sve za nju"" and ""Krijesnica"" and their users will, from time to time, come to stay for free and participate in different retreats.</p>
<p>Why not invite people to put some light back into their lives? Well, here, they are invited to stay between the trees, to find the motivation, and to find inspiration by participating in healing programs. Maybe by healing the mind, the body can be healed as well. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621249684/roa5lk99rndblxncgyh9.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621249699/wqqmse8qaoixazc8jac1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b>“Place your hands into soil to feel grounded. Wade in water to feel emotionally healed. Fill your lungs with fresh air to feel mentally clear. Raise your face to the heat of the sun and connect with that fire to feel your own immense power”</b></p>
<p>We will show what a responsible tourist destination means in an overcrowded and overwhelmed tourist country such as Croatia and focus on the continental part of the country. ""Mass tourism shows a loss of the authenticity &amp; quality of the destination while doing it merely for-profit and stripping it of its essence until it’s no longer recognizable.""</p>
<p>Environmentally conscious travel does not mean compromising on comfort, nor socially aware travel should. It can only bring more value to the money. The desire to give something back to the places we visit is wholesome and ought to be encouraged.</p>
<p>That's why your stay with us means much more. It changes people's lives.</p>
<p><b>...GREEN IS THE NEW BLACK</b></p>
<p>Heat pumps will be installed for every treehouse and the main house. These pumps use air as a source of energy, they transform the outside air for heating or cooling of the indoor spaces. The pumps will also double as water heaters.</p>
<p>Bio septic sewage system will be installed, providing eco-friendly wastewater treatment. </p>
<p>Rainwater harvesting will be done through the roof of a house and a small farmhouse. Environmental friendly materials will be used while building. We talk about bio-architecture: all walls (including roof and floor) are insulated with rigid insulating panels that contribute to optimizing the thermal performance and consumption of the house.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620741323/tbxb9tobelkvl7x0dm2p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Everything from bed linen to the food will be organic and fair trade. Tables, chairs, bed frames will be built from local or recycled materials and by local designers. The material from the salvaged house and the barn will be incorporated into the building.</p>
<p>All bathrooms will have water-saving shower systems, environmentally-friendly paper (from copier paper, toilet paper, paper towels), organic towels, and low-water toilets in order to use significantly less water. Composting material will be used for the garden while recycling bins will be placed throughout the property.</p>
<p>An organic garden will be planted from which all the food will be coming from, including neighboring farms as well.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>RISK &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is finishing the project by August 2021. This year has taught the whole world not to plan much, but I have been waiting for this to happen for so long and all I have left now is time and hope. You being the hope. The covid virus can ruin the plan as well, but this type of accommodation and service will work perfectly in the upcoming years. Even if we don’t do this on time, the retreat will be open.</p>
<p>Delivering rewards: some rewards will be delivered in 2 phases, such as planting trees. The first part is the certificate and loyalty card that will come as soon as possible in digital shape to the backer email address. The exact planting of trees will be in autumn as that is the best time to do so. That being said, the other part of the rewards, such as the photo of the tree or the birdhouse for ex. will be delivered later, again in digital shape so we avoid impact on the environment. Other rewards such as accommodation in treehouses will be possible from the moment we open the retreat, starting August or September. The backers will be welcome to come and use their rewards and see some on the property. We just need to build it. ""Build it and they will come. ""</p>

This project was successfully funded on Kickstarter on the 13th of May.  The kindest 606 souls helped me raise $77,000 for the project of a lifetime. As we are talking about a lifetime, there is tons of work to be done on the property. And you can help me create the most kindest destination in Croatia. You can still book nights in treehouses with promotional prices only on Indiegogo InDemand! Or plant a tree, adopt one from the forest, sponsor a birdhouse or help me build the
 glass greenhouse! Power to the forest!
 
THE DREAM
We are on a mission to build an environmentally and socially conscious retreat with treehouses, like no other. Secluded within the pristine forests of Rastoke, Croatia, Tree Elements greets travelers and shelter-seekers with equal respect.
Creating the kindest treehouse eco-retreat in the world and devoting ourselves to the forest while giving back to the people and to Mother Nature, the retreat will be built with locally sourced materials. Life at Tree Elements is a story of community and conservation of natural and cultural heritage. Help us make our dream come true!

HOW IT ALL STARTED
In 2018 I bought 7 acres/ 28,000m2 of forest land near Rastoke village by Korana river in Croatia. There was nothing on the property except an old house from 1906, a small barn, and one gorgeous linden tree.  The moment I saw the property I knew this was the place where I wanted to create something magical, where I wanted to grow my roots. The proximity of the most beautiful national park in the country - Plitvice Lakes, was just an added bonus. 
I've dreamt of creating a zero-waste, plastic-free, treehouse retreat for a long time. The result is Tree Elements, a labor of love, passion, and dedication. But there’s more: I dream of redefining the concept of travel. Not promoting mass tourism, but proposing an ecological, sustainable, and socially aware way to explore and enjoy travel.

I welcome both travelers and organizations that help those in need.
Now, me and my family are so close to turning the whole property into a zero-waste, zero-plastic retreat and a holistic center called ""Tree Elements"".Wooden treehouses named Earth, Water & Wind are all secluded inside the forest, together with the new main house -the gathering place representing the Ether elementand a renovated barn, now a small farmhouse, the Fire element.


WHO ARE YOU?

I am a young girl with an old soul, hanging from a tree, completely in love with them, with nature and life, a huge fighter for justice, for people, and for Mother Earth.
The idea of what I want to do with my life, truly and fully, came to me when I was, luckily, only 28. It was crystal clear: change my career, buy a forest, build treehouses and come up with something new, something kind.

I got my first job in tourism when I was 15 and since then I was saving money like a little squirrel. I have been working and observing the industry for 17 years now, from selling souvenirs, being a cleaning lady, doing PR, working as a waiter, bartender, to working at the hotel's front desks. From working in hostels and managing apartments, to being a guest in numerous places as a tour guide, I knew that this was not the path I was willing to follow because tourism desperately needs improving. I wanted something more, something different and something that could change people’s lives. I wanted to change the way how tourism works and thinks!
That is why I aim to create the kindest eco-retreat in the world, in the middle of Croatia, to devote myself to this forest, to nature, and to the people. All of this with immense help and support from my family and friends. 
RETREAT YOURSELF

Do you want to get away from everything? Yet, be connected to everything? 
In Tree Elements, you can rent a treehouse, or even the whole property and get married in the forest. You can participate in workshops and find inspiration and in yoga, meditation, and healing retreats or make your own retreat. You can come with your team and do a team-building session, shoot a movie, a music video,  or volunteer and educate... And plant trees in your sleep!
There are endless possibilities. As my love for this project is. It has been for years now.
I am not here to promote mass tourism, I am here to propose a new concept of it for which I've coined the term 'eco-kind', meaning, in addition to being ecological and sustainable in the 21st century, we should be also socially aware of the time we live in and be kind to people. 
By staying in our eco-kind retreat, you can help those members of society who might need to heal in this forest the most. You will be promoting environmentally aware travel while being kind to others. 
So we have partnered with organizations that help cancer survivors, abused women, and children with malignant diseases. By inviting them to stay on the property for free and giving them the chance to participate in a variety of workshops and retreats, we want to help them heal from trauma in this magical forest and provide a home away from home. 
We aspire to inspire other business owners to follow the idea. So far, the media houses in Croatia and abroad have recognized the value of the project, for which we are more than grateful and we hope this will have an immense impact on other businesses. 

HOME AMONG THE TREES
The retreat will be open 365 days a year, from August 2021, offering all of you a chance to visit whenever you can. Imagine waking up in a custom-made bed in the middle of the forest, in a treehouse of your choice. Shepherd Nicola is passing by you with his sheep while you are going to the main house for breakfast. If you are not in the mood of leaving your nest, you can have breakfast delivered to you. Now, you might want to go for a walk down to the river for a swim, meditate a bit on a meadow and read a good book you have borrowed from the central library in the main house. 

Then, you would like to cook something yummy so you visit the organic garden, pick your own fruits and veggies and hang out with domestic animals. Later on, you might want to participate in yoga, meditation & healing programs, maybe attend a workshop, go on a hike, visit the National Park Plitvice Lakes or get a bike and enjoy numerous activities in the region.  Or you rented the whole property and got married! CONGRATULATIONS!
All of it while helping others with your stay and planting trees in your sleep! 


WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET?
We need to build a village! A village of treehouses! And you get to be among the first ones to visit. Or anytime in the future, for that manner. Just come and visit us! Or you can get something for our Mother Nature, by planting a tree, sponsoring a birdhouse, or simply he
TREEHOUSES EARTH, WATER & WIND

Imagine a place where you can rent more than a treehouse. Where you get a lifestyle while giving back. 
When promising peace & quiet, it is important to deliver precisely that. That’s why there are only 3 treehouses for you to rent: Earth, Water & Wind, representing the elements of Nature. 
You will be high in the air since all of them are almost 3 m (9 feet) above the ground, while the highest point is set on 9 m (18  feet). All of them will be built with wood and glass all coming from Croatian producers. The exterior is the same, while the interiors change according to the element they represent, so each one has a story to tell through interesting details and colors.
All of them have been designed to take advantage of passive cooling and heating with heat pumps, thus reducing the need for air-conditioning. ""Push"" valves, water-saving showerheads, and low flush toilet systems will be installed to preserve water while rainwater will be collected for watering the garden, flushing toilets, washing the clothes, and general household cleaning.

The size of each treehouse is 25 m2 (260ft2), all containing living space, a fully equipped kitchen, and a bathroom on one floor, while the gallery (13m2/139ft2) features a king-size bed. It can fit 4 people (with a custom-made pullout sofa). The living room opens out to a lovely wooden terrace through beautiful glass doors. Under each treehouse, we will have a decorated space for you to relax on hammocks, while the communal space will be in the main house and in front of it, under this big linden tree.

FIRE ELEMENT - the small farmhouse
This will be my home for the beginning. It was supposed to be a wood workshop but since we lack funds to furnish the main house, and since I need to supervise the construction until August, I need to be there. I want to start working on the farm as soon as possible, once this little guy is built. So we have decided to renovate the old barn into a small farmhouse that will also serve as accommodation in near future for different retreats and occasions.


The wood workshop will come, hopefully, with your help. Some funds we raise here can create a place where we would educate people about the importance of wood and natural materials. We want it to be an inspirational space and a place where, with local wood makers, we can create magic for the forest and more. 
ETHER ELEMENT - the main house and the gathering place

The five elements theory existed in many ancient cultures such as Greek, Japanese, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and more. The fifth element on top of the earth, air, fire, and water, is space or aether. The Ether element is the space in which everything happens. 
So is this house, a place in which it all happens. Place of gatherings, of the people - all of you who visit or help in any way and leave a part of yourself here.  Here, you will attend workshops and numerous programs and meet me, my family, other travelers, or simply enjoy a home-cooked meal... You may also rent the house and the whole property, having the forest just for yourself.
It will hold a central library under the wooden stairs filled with local green guides, inspirational and motivational books, books about nature, food, novels… 


HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED AND WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?

Starting from scratch, without any infrastructure... it is expensive, to say the least. I've spent all of my personal savings (including my parents and my sister's).  From 2018, the money went for land,  road, water and electricity, rainwatertanks, bio sewage tanks, heat pumps for heating and cooling, organic garden, construction of the small farmhouse, foundations for everything, steel construction, architects, paperwork, and a deposit for the construction of the treehouses with the main house (20%). The rest 80% is covered with the loan from the bank, but not enough to finish all of this. They started to build the first prefabricated house in May, 2021.
I was ready to take the leap already in 2020 and then She showed up. Corona came, I lost my job as a tour guide, lost my income and a possibility to get an investment loan which completely changed my plans... This is when my parents and my sister got financially involved with loaning the money for foundations, steel construction, and bio sewage tanks.Without their help, I would be deep down. Deeper than Adele, believe me.  Now, all eyes are on me to finish this battle. By backing this project I will have the funds for the interior decoration and a bit of exterior.

 
 Due to the unfortunate situation in the tourism industry caused by the spread of Coronavirus the banks were not investing in tourism-related projects.
If Corona did not happen, I would easily get the investment loan with the amount needed things would be much different. So after 10 different banks refused my application for the investment and 16 months of battle against windmills, I was finally able to get a loan to cover all the construction, but not enough amount.  So what now?
You need to sleep in a bed, right? You need a nice kitchen to cook some lovely fresh meals? Do you need a sofa to sit and watch outside? Sure thing you do.


YOU are the key

YOU can help me finish make my dream come true by Aug 2021. $35,000 would go directly into the interior of the treehouses. Things like kitchens, beds, bathroom equipment and so on would be funded from your support, so they are ready for your visit.
Other rewards would be for the exterior. Not only for this property (wood workshop, pathways) but for Her.  Mother Nature.  After all, it is Her property.
Think homes for the birds while planting more and more trees, a rich organic forest garden, and then magic! Wooden benches with inspirational thoughts, art sculptures made by local designers, and a glasshouse with herbs and spices...
Here's the breakdown;
$30,000 - interior works for three guest treehouses 
$15,000 - interior works for the main house
$30,000 - exterior and landscaping  
More funds received would go into the landscaping, plus things such as a pathway to the river, a decent chicken coop, a yoga amphitheater, irrigation system, wooden deck for the main house, more domestic animals, a tool shed, glass greenhouse,  little spots around the forest to unwind and so many unexpected expenses.

THE IMPACT
We want for a traveler to develop a growing sense of one another, our world, and our place in it. Yes, there should be a connection between the traveler and the local community with the environment but the purchase of something should have an impact locally & directly as well as morally. Why not supporting eco-kind businesses and change the tourism industry?
A retreat where all the furniture comes from local designers, all the products are bought from little producers who are making a difference, where food comes from the organic garden or neighboring farms and your stay supports planting trees around Croatia!
PLANT TREES IN YOUR SLEEP
We are proud to have partners as ""Zasadi stablo, ne budi panj""(""Plant a tree, don't be a stump""), an environmental non-profit association responsible for the (r)evolution of collective planting in Croatia. It started from one week of planting trees last year to the whole month of March of this year. With the help of 55,000 volunteers, they have planted more than 150,000 trees. And that number is growing.

We want to be part of that number, on a large scale. This is our way to give back to Mother Nature. In these times when She needs it the most.
With the help of our partners, we will plant trees provided by Tree Elements. How? Simple.
Each stay = 1 tree planted.  A little forest revolution.
Ok, not so simple. Since we are doing something nobody has done before. At least not in this country. Your pledge for planting trees will help plant and grow the first Miyawaki forest in Croatia!! It is a technique pioneered by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, that helps build dense, native forests and ensures plant growth 10 times faster and 30 times denserthan usual. It involves planting native species in the same area and becomes maintenance-free after the first three years. 
By staying with us you can show what a responsible and sustainable travel destination is, away from the masses, while being ecologically and socially aware of the time we live in. The essence should be the interaction, not only a transaction.
Make forests, not war! 
 
ECO - KIND TOURISM 
The idea of - tourism for all - is reflected in giving the treehouses for free, to users of different organizations around the country who help abused women, children, and cancer patients... In the 21 century, the emphasis is on the environment and sustainability but what if it could include social input as well? Being kind to one another? So we have decided to partner with organizations ""Sve za nju"" and ""Krijesnica"" and their users will, from time to time, come to stay for free and participate in different retreats.
Why not invite people to put some light back into their lives? Well, here, they are invited to stay between the trees, to find the motivation, and to find inspiration by participating in healing programs. Maybe by healing the mind, the body can be healed as well. 

“Place your hands into soil to feel grounded. Wade in water to feel emotionally healed. Fill your lungs with fresh air to feel mentally clear. Raise your face to the heat of the sun and connect with that fire to feel your own immense power”
We will show what a responsible tourist destination means in an overcrowded and overwhelmed tourist country such as Croatia and focus on the continental part of the country. ""Mass tourism shows a loss of the authenticity & quality of the destination while doing it merely for-profit and stripping it of its essence until it’s no longer recognizable.""
Environmentally conscious travel does not mean compromising on comfort, nor socially aware travel should. It can only bring more value to the money. The desire to give something back to the places we visit is wholesome and ought to be encouraged.
That's why your stay with us means much more. It changes people's lives.
...GREEN IS THE NEW BLACK
Heat pumps will be installed for every treehouse and the main house. These pumps use air as a source of energy, they transform the outside air for heating or cooling of the indoor spaces. The pumps will also double as water heaters.
Bio septic sewage system will be installed, providing eco-friendly wastewater treatment. 
Rainwater harvesting will be done through the roof of a house and a small farmhouse. Environmental friendly materials will be used while building. We talk about bio-architecture: all walls (including roof and floor) are insulated with rigid insulating panels that contribute to optimizing the thermal performance and consumption of the house.

Everything from bed linen to the food will be organic and fair trade. Tables, chairs, bed frames will be built from local or recycled materials and by local designers. The material from the salvaged house and the barn will be incorporated into the building.
All bathrooms will have water-saving shower systems, environmentally-friendly paper (from copier paper, toilet paper, paper towels), organic towels, and low-water toilets in order to use significantly less water. Composting material will be used for the garden while recycling bins will be placed throughout the property.
An organic garden will be planted from which all the food will be coming from, including neighboring farms as well.


LOCATION & ACTIVITIES
In the heart of Croatia, in Karlovac county, surrounded by the gorgeous river Korana, close to 3 more rivers and 3 national parks. The proximity (40mins) of Plitvice Lakes National Park is something that should be cherished and I am forever grateful to find this amazing location where all of you will be able to relax, connect with the Earth, give yourself a break, and find that peace the forest is filled with.


The retreat is a 1.30hrs drive from the capital, Zagreb, the biggest airport in the country (100km-60miles)
 Rastoke waterfall village – 10mins drive from the property, the introduction to the NP Plitvice lakes, where waterfalls are a common sight in people's backyards.
Border with Bosnia & Hercegovina is 35 mins away, where one can find the best rafting center in the region; whitewater rafting & canoeing on Una river
Adriatic coast (the northern part with Istria region and Dalmatian coast with Zadar) is to be found a bit over 2hrs drive from the property (160km/100miles)
 Gorski Kotar, the region perfect for skiing & hiking, the green lungs of Croatia or the Croatian Switzerland, is just 2 hrs away, with NP Risnjak 
 NP Velebit on 1:45mins of drive can pleasantly surprise travelers with hiking options and with Kuterevo - home to the first Bear Orphanage in Croatia, providing shelter to young, abandoned bears.


In addition, there is a world of possibilities to do:

hiking, trekking, horseback riding, cycling (11okm/70miles of trails)
visiting 4 different rivers, lakes, underground caves, the largest underground airport and military base of ex Yugoslavia
kayaking, canoeing, swimming, fishing, rafting
photo safari (brown bears, lynxes, wolves, foxes, deer, rabbits, wild boars, quails, pheasants, etc.)
Nordic walking (18 trails in Karlovac county)
paintball, archery, zipline, quad adventure, adrenalin park

 
RISK & CHALLENGES
The biggest risk is finishing the project by August 2021. This year has taught the whole world not to plan much, but I have been waiting for this to happen for so long and all I have left now is time and hope. You being the hope. The covid virus can ruin the plan as well, but this type of accommodation and service will work perfectly in the upcoming years. Even if we don’t do this on time, the retreat will be open.
Delivering rewards: some rewards will be delivered in 2 phases, such as planting trees. The first part is the certificate and loyalty card that will come as soon as possible in digital shape to the backer email address. The exact planting of trees will be in autumn as that is the best time to do so. That being said, the other part of the rewards, such as the photo of the tree or the birdhouse for ex. will be delivered later, again in digital shape so we avoid impact on the environment. Other rewards such as accommodation in treehouses will be possible from the moment we open the retreat, starting August or September. The backers will be welcome to come and use their rewards and see some on the property. We just need to build it. ""Build it and they will come. ""

<h2>How What We Do Is Different</h2>
<p><strong>WHATS IS A NATURAL FOOD FOR A CAT OR DOG?</strong></p>
<p>Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it should be eaten.  There are a lot of natural foods that are NOT species appropriate.  There are a lot of natural toxins too.</p>
<p>The most relevant question is - are you feeding a biologically or species appropriate food. Most people would not feed meat to a horse or a cow because they are herbivores. We would not expect a snake to eat grain.  Panda Bears eat bamboo, many insects eat plant leaves.  All species have species appropriate foods that they are biologically capable of digesting and obtaining nourishment from.</p>
<p>While many species share similar external traits; often their internal physiology to digest food is drastically different. Apes and humans have very different digestive physiologies and capabilities.  Many herd animals like cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, deer, llamas, alpacas and camels known as ruminants or camelids have three or four stomachs.</p>
<p><strong>Following The Science</strong></p>
<p>Humans are classified as omnivores and have the ability to eat and survive on both plants and animal matter.  Horses, cows, rabbits, etc are classified as plant eating herbivores.</p>
<p>Cats &amp; Dogs are classified as carnivores, ""meat eaters"". Carnivores are animals whose food and energy requirements derive solely from animal tissue or meat, whether through hunting or scavenging. Carnivores do NOT digest plant material like herbivores or omnivores and DO NOT obtain the same nutrients from them.  Even if cats and dogs  could break down the cellulose to get to the nutrients out of plant matter, their intestines are too short to get anything useful out of it.   In addition, the long-term eating of foods that are not biologically or species appropriate may cause immune or allergic reactions and a syndrome commonly known as “leaky gut”.</p>
<p>Dogs and Cats do get nutrients from plants when they eat prey animals that eat plants.</p>
<p><strong>Medicinal Value Of Some Plants For Dogs</strong></p>
<p>There are some medicinal value in some plants for dogs. Dogs are scavengers and would naturally snack on or eat small amounts of plant material, including roots, berries, and vegetation. Dogs produce very small amounts of an enzyme called amylase needed to break down plant matter. Dogs only produce enough amylase to break down already partially digested plant matter in the stomach of a very small prey animal. Therefore, dogs may have the ability to receive some medicinal values found in very small amounts of berries, spinach, etc.</p>
<p>Cats &amp; Dogs may consume fruits, vegetables, and grasses; however the only nutritional value may be fiber - because natural fiber would be fur or feathers from prey animals.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://rawdogbarkery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAW DOG BARKERY</a> IS DIFFERENT</strong></p>
<p>Common cat and dog foods &amp; treats are loaded with carbs, sugar, grains, plant proteins, synthetic vitamins &amp; minerals, preservatives or unidentifiable ingredients; often sourced from outside the United States.</p>
<p>Raw Dog Barkery’s products are made from familiar and easily identifiable and digestible biologically appropriate ingredients from USDA inspected sources. All of our ingredients are made from prime cuts of meat that were intended for human consumption.  Our products are gluten free, starch free, dye free,  preservative free,  and contain no artificial (or added) flavors or synthetic vitamins.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630375173/d12adydeedplxhjsjvpn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The trend of many companies in the pet industry is to advertise that their products are <strong>""sustainable"" or ""responsibly sourced"". </strong> This sounds well intended but is deceptive and usually means the food contains sources not intended for human consumption, involves recycling and can contain many dangerous waste products.  Raw Dog Barkery does not consider our beloved pets garbage dumps. Our products are made from nutrient dense prime cuts (not trimmings) that are intended for human consumption.  </p>

We are also installing walk in freezers and coolers, and commercial kitchen equipment. We are very dedicated to quality controls and disciplined in not taking on more business than we can handle. If we can not fund the new machine; we are still up and operational with smaller machines and are confident we will take our mission to the next level; but just over a longer period of time.  We are sincerely hopeful about providing small businesses like independent neighborhood pet stores with a competitive advantage over the big box stores. </p>

We make biologically and species appropriate treats for cats and dogs. 
Our products look like real whole food because it is real whole food.  Our real whole food products will become your dog and cats favorite treats. You will know you are feeding as good or better ingredients as you eat. 



 

The most important FIVE things to know about Raw Dog Barkery is:

We LOVE Our Cats & Dogs
We Are Super SERIOUS About Pet Nutrition
ALL of Our Products Are Made From Real Whole Foods
We Support Small Businesses Like Independent Neighborhood Pet Stores by partnering with private labeling and supporting their brand! 
We have ALL of our perks in stock and are ready to ship

 SERIOUS BUT FUN
A lot of times, health food is boring.  We wanted to make a healthy, fun and exciting species appropriate treats for cats and dogs. Our products look like real food because they are real whole foods with absolutely no preservatives.  Our products look like they came from a butcher shop.  
Raw Dog Barkery products are only sourced from USDA inspected meats intended for human consumption and are made in Brookfield, Wisconsin.
 We Love What We Do and Do What We Love!


We have three full-time employees and we are working seven days a week making our products - AND LOVE IT! But, we are at capacity.
Raw Dog Barkery needs to build a monster expensive custom machine to expand our proprietary process of making biologically and species appropriate food and treats for independent neighborhood pet stores (True Small Businesses).
Ninety percent of pet foods in the US are made by two companies.  Independent neighborhood pet stores are true small business and benefit significantly from selling a private labeled incredibly unique product that can't be found at a big box store.  
We Are Just Getting Started & Need Your Help
The fact is, at Raw Dog Barkery we are just getting started and have the attention of so many independent neighborhood pet stores we can’t keep up with the demand and need your help.  
Wayne & Kevin
We Need A Large Machine
Using our proprietary process and a few special engineers we need to build a monster expensive machine ($500,000)! We are up and running with smaller machines. However, it will take nearly a year to order, build and install our new custom machine. 

Raw Dog Barkery Monster Machine Rendering
Actual Similar Machine with Different Control System & Software

If we are successful funding our new machine, we think we can change the quality of pet treats everywhere. We strongly believe we can have a significant impact on supporting small businesses because Independent neighborhood pet stores will be ultra invested in selling their brand and a product that can not be found anywhere else.
How What We Do Is Different
WHATS IS A NATURAL FOOD FOR A CAT OR DOG?
Just because something is natural doesn’t mean it should be eaten.  There are a lot of natural foods that are NOT species appropriate.  There are a lot of natural toxins too.
The most relevant question is - are you feeding a biologically or species appropriate food. Most people would not feed meat to a horse or a cow because they are herbivores. We would not expect a snake to eat grain.  Panda Bears eat bamboo, many insects eat plant leaves.  All species have species appropriate foods that they are biologically capable of digesting and obtaining nourishment from.
While many species share similar external traits; often their internal physiology to digest food is drastically different. Apes and humans have very different digestive physiologies and capabilities.  Many herd animals like cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, deer, llamas, alpacas and camels known as ruminants or camelids have three or four stomachs.
Following The Science
Humans are classified as omnivores and have the ability to eat and survive on both plants and animal matter.  Horses, cows, rabbits, etc are classified as plant eating herbivores.
Cats & Dogs are classified as carnivores, ""meat eaters"". Carnivores are animals whose food and energy requirements derive solely from animal tissue or meat, whether through hunting or scavenging. Carnivores do NOT digest plant material like herbivores or omnivores and DO NOT obtain the same nutrients from them.  Even if cats and dogs  could break down the cellulose to get to the nutrients out of plant matter, their intestines are too short to get anything useful out of it.   In addition, the long-term eating of foods that are not biologically or species appropriate may cause immune or allergic reactions and a syndrome commonly known as “leaky gut”.
Dogs and Cats do get nutrients from plants when they eat prey animals that eat plants.
Medicinal Value Of Some Plants For Dogs
There are some medicinal value in some plants for dogs. Dogs are scavengers and would naturally snack on or eat small amounts of plant material, including roots, berries, and vegetation. Dogs produce very small amounts of an enzyme called amylase needed to break down plant matter. Dogs only produce enough amylase to break down already partially digested plant matter in the stomach of a very small prey animal. Therefore, dogs may have the ability to receive some medicinal values found in very small amounts of berries, spinach, etc.
Cats & Dogs may consume fruits, vegetables, and grasses; however the only nutritional value may be fiber - because natural fiber would be fur or feathers from prey animals.
RAW DOG BARKERY IS DIFFERENT
Common cat and dog foods & treats are loaded with carbs, sugar, grains, plant proteins, synthetic vitamins & minerals, preservatives or unidentifiable ingredients; often sourced from outside the United States.
Raw Dog Barkery’s products are made from familiar and easily identifiable and digestible biologically appropriate ingredients from USDA inspected sources. All of our ingredients are made from prime cuts of meat that were intended for human consumption.  Our products are gluten free, starch free, dye free,  preservative free,  and contain no artificial (or added) flavors or synthetic vitamins.

The trend of many companies in the pet industry is to advertise that their products are ""sustainable"" or ""responsibly sourced"".  This sounds well intended but is deceptive and usually means the food contains sources not intended for human consumption, involves recycling and can contain many dangerous waste products.  Raw Dog Barkery does not consider our beloved pets garbage dumps. Our products are made from nutrient dense prime cuts (not trimmings) that are intended for human consumption.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Michelle Martinetti, and I'm the Founder + CEO of River Valley Arts Center. I have spent the majority of my adult life working to support my community through ACTION. I've taken action by working with area not-for-profits. I've taken action by fundraising for the Eleanor Roosevelt Center at Val-Kill, American Cancer Society, and Angels of Light. Now, I'm taking action to support unique experiences that bring the community together to celebrate creativity and the spirit of the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What if you could experience diverse programs like yoga, dance, music, art, robotics, culinary, and more all under one roof? YOU CAN!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What if you could bring your kids, all at the same time, for music lessons, tutoring, mindfulness workshops, and more? YOU CAN!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">What if you could host cooking classes, run meetings, teach workshops, and more while only paying for the time you need? YOU CAN!</p>
<p>This is exactly why I took action and founded River Valley Arts Center in the beautiful and historic Village of Wappingers Falls. I wanted to create a space where families can gather and enrich themselves with a whole host of different arts and education programming. I wanted to support the small business community by offering a unique way for them to bring their services to customers without long-term commitment getting in the way. I wanted a place where I can watch the community come together and grow.</p>
<p>River Valley Arts Center is the Hudson Valley's premier multi-use facility for arts and community programs. After a ton of hard work and determination, I secured a fantastic location in the heart of the Village ripe for a renaissance. What was previously the United Methodist Church and School Annex located at 9 S Mesier Ave is now undergoing stunning renovations to breathe new life into the building. I'm working with an amazing crew to update the space by adding new lighting, sheetrock, floors and making it ADA-compliant. Once finished, the updated building will house 13 unique spaces - including 9 studios, 1 large studio/small event space, a conference room, a commissary kitchen, and finally, a stupendous event space to gather the community together.</p>
<p>I know that with this revitalization, our entire community will benefit. With your help, I'm hoping we can make an even greater impact! I need you to take action and help us raise funds to support our tenants and the community by outfitting our spaces to make them beautiful, accessible, and ready to go.</p>
<p>With the funds raised, I hope to purchase:</p>

<h3>My story</h3>
<p>I, Bobbi-Lee Smart, am a bookworm. I love books and have always loved them. Like Belle, I would have married the Beast for the library alone! Books have been one of the biggest influences in my life. They made me who I am today. Mostly romance novels which I started reading around 12 &amp; still avidly read today, though my taste in them has changed drastically.   In my neighborhood, there was not an independent, or even chain, bookstores that I can recall. I purchased most of my books (after Scholastic book fairs) from thrift stores or swap meets. I definitely have no recollection of a space where I could hang out with other bookworms and talk about the books we were reading. This is why I decided that I needed to create the community that I wish I had when I was younger. A bookstore that is also a community space.</p>
<p>And because I am a nerd I went into academia and am currently an adjunct/contingent/part-time Sociology instructor in the community college system. I LOVE teaching and sharing knowledge. My favorite thing in the world is watching a student's eyes light up because the material is clicking. However, this journey has also made me realize how important it is to share knowledge outside of the traditional educational settings. Not everyone has the privilege of attending college, for a variety of reasons, and not everyone wants to attend college! That doesn't mean they don't yearn to learn &amp; engage in conversations about books and life. </p>
<p>It's also important to note that I am an intersectional feminist. When I said earlier my taste in romance novels changed, it is because as I continue to grow into my identity as an intersectional feminist, the books I previously read became less appealing. Now don't get me wrong I will always have an affinity for the authors I grew up reading, however, their books were not featuring people I could relate to as an adult. When I was a teen and even a young adult, I aspired to be like the women in the books, but as a grown woman I realized I was never going to be them and their stories were not gripping me the way they used to. Then I discovered diverse authors who told stories about diverse characters and I saw not only myself, but my friends reflected in those stories. I fell in love all over again. It's important to me that this bookstore centers books by and for diverse women so others can fall in love with reading by seeing themselves and their stories reflected in the books they are reading.</p>
<p>Subverting Expectations will be starting as an online bookstore (which will be live in July 2021) that also hosts pop-up booths at community events. We are also planning to be active on social media to start to create a community before we are able to open a physical space. And let me tell you we have plans for the physical space! Open mic nights, stand-up comedy, workshops ranging from writing resumes to sexual health, book clubs, and movie nights. We plan to have space for people to read, socialize, and even quiet spaces to work or study. The goal is to open the brick &amp; mortar store within the next 2 years.</p>
<h3>Our Mission Statement</h3>
<p>We are an unapologetically intersectional feminist community that celebrates all things women. </p>
<p>We understand that women can be multiple things at once. Women can be anything they want to be, even if those things seem contradictory. Strong and vulnerable, sexual and professional, outspoken and personable, book and street smart, analytical and into woo. Our mission is to create a space where women feel empowered to embrace every aspect of themselves.</p>
<p>By existing fully as ourselves, we will dismantle the patriarchy and white supremacy. By making resources accessible, Subverting Expectations is aiding and abetting people to create their own destinies and to live their most authentic lives. </p>
<p>We are co-conspirators to historically underrepresented and marginalized communities. We will discuss social issues and share knowledge on how to be a part of the solution. We are here to uplift, empower, and create a safe place for everyone in the way they need and want us to.</p>
<p>We understand that learning happens in different forms. We not only learn by reading but also having open discussions about books and life in general. We get to learn about other people, their experiences, and how they see the world. This makes us more aware, more empathetic, and that makes the world a better place. </p>
<p>We love learning. We love knowing things. We want to provide people with the opportunity to fall in love with knowledge and learning.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is it that we need &amp; what you get for helping:</h3>
<p>What your donation can help us accomplish:</p>
<ul><li>The most important place that your donations are going is to inventory, aka BOOKS! While we will be starting as an online store, we will also be doing local community pop-up events. We would like to carry roughly 500 books at any given time, which is about $5,000 worth of books. The more donations we get the wider the variety of books we will have at the pop-up events.</li></ul>
<ul><li>We will also need equipment to set up the pop-up booths. Tables, chairs, banners, crates to carry the books, display fixtures, a pop-up tent, and all of the other necessities to have a successful pop-up booth. This will be around $3,000.</li></ul>
<ul><li>We will also have merchandise available at the pop-ups, such as tumblers, mugs, bookmarks, tote bags, and more! We are budgeting $2,000 for the initial costs of these items.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Turns out an online bookstore costs a pretty penny. From hosting the website to the point of sales system to licensing and professional membership fees the initial start-up fees will run about another $5,000. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want this to be a truly communal space where the customers help us create our community. Where people tell us what they would like us to add or incorporate and we do our best to make those things happen. This is a collaboration. And while we cannot promise to cover everything we want to be open to ideas and growth. Having an eclectic team and support system, it is imperative that Subverting Expectations bring a little bit of everything to this space for my fellow eclectics to embrace all aspects of themselves. From access to politicians, to talks about sex, to discussing current events, to learning new make-up trends, I want to create a space where everyone feels welcome, valued, and comfortable to explore new things. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As an independent online bookstore, it may be difficult for us to stand out and compete against a larger online retailer who shall not be named. However, we know that we offer something unique and that there has been a move to shop and support small businesses. We know that we will have to adjust and adapt as necessary and as we get to know what our community requires and desires. While there will be difficult times, we are committed to making this dream a reality. This will be a journey &amp; we are excited to have you along for the ride.</p>

</div></div>","My story
I, Bobbi-Lee Smart, am a bookworm. I love books and have always loved them. Like Belle, I would have married the Beast for the library alone! Books have been one of the biggest influences in my life. They made me who I am today. Mostly romance novels which I started reading around 12 & still avidly read today, though my taste in them has changed drastically.   In my neighborhood, there was not an independent, or even chain, bookstores that I can recall. I purchased most of my books (after Scholastic book fairs) from thrift stores or swap meets. I definitely have no recollection of a space where I could hang out with other bookworms and talk about the books we were reading. This is why I decided that I needed to create the community that I wish I had when I was younger. A bookstore that is also a community space.
And because I am a nerd I went into academia and am currently an adjunct/contingent/part-time Sociology instructor in the community college system. I LOVE teaching and sharing knowledge. My favorite thing in the world is watching a student's eyes light up because the material is clicking. However, this journey has also made me realize how important it is to share knowledge outside of the traditional educational settings. Not everyone has the privilege of attending college, for a variety of reasons, and not everyone wants to attend college! That doesn't mean they don't yearn to learn & engage in conversations about books and life. 
It's also important to note that I am an intersectional feminist. When I said earlier my taste in romance novels changed, it is because as I continue to grow into my identity as an intersectional feminist, the books I previously read became less appealing. Now don't get me wrong I will always have an affinity for the authors I grew up reading, however, their books were not featuring people I could relate to as an adult. When I was a teen and even a young adult, I aspired to be like the women in the books, but as a grown woman I realized I was never going to be them and their stories were not gripping me the way they used to. Then I discovered diverse authors who told stories about diverse characters and I saw not only myself, but my friends reflected in those stories. I fell in love all over again. It's important to me that this bookstore centers books by and for diverse women so others can fall in love with reading by seeing themselves and their stories reflected in the books they are reading.
Subverting Expectations will be starting as an online bookstore (which will be live in July 2021) that also hosts pop-up booths at community events. We are also planning to be active on social media to start to create a community before we are able to open a physical space. And let me tell you we have plans for the physical space! Open mic nights, stand-up comedy, workshops ranging from writing resumes to sexual health, book clubs, and movie nights. We plan to have space for people to read, socialize, and even quiet spaces to work or study. The goal is to open the brick & mortar store within the next 2 years.
Our Mission Statement
We are an unapologetically intersectional feminist community that celebrates all things women. 
We understand that women can be multiple things at once. Women can be anything they want to be, even if those things seem contradictory. Strong and vulnerable, sexual and professional, outspoken and personable, book and street smart, analytical and into woo. Our mission is to create a space where women feel empowered to embrace every aspect of themselves.
By existing fully as ourselves, we will dismantle the patriarchy and white supremacy. By making resources accessible, Subverting Expectations is aiding and abetting people to create their own destinies and to live their most authentic lives. 
We are co-conspirators to historically underrepresented and marginalized communities. We will discuss social issues and share knowledge on how to be a part of the solution. We are here to uplift, empower, and create a safe place for everyone in the way they need and want us to.
We understand that learning happens in different forms. We not only learn by reading but also having open discussions about books and life in general. We get to learn about other people, their experiences, and how they see the world. This makes us more aware, more empathetic, and that makes the world a better place. 
We love learning. We love knowing things. We want to provide people with the opportunity to fall in love with knowledge and learning.

What is it that we need & what you get for helping:
What your donation can help us accomplish:
The most important place that your donations are going is to inventory, aka BOOKS! While we will be starting as an online store, we will also be doing local community pop-up events. We would like to carry roughly 500 books at any given time, which is about $5,000 worth of books. The more donations we get the wider the variety of books we will have at the pop-up events.
We will also need equipment to set up the pop-up booths. Tables, chairs, banners, crates to carry the books, display fixtures, a pop-up tent, and all of the other necessities to have a successful pop-up booth. This will be around $3,000.
We will also have merchandise available at the pop-ups, such as tumblers, mugs, bookmarks, tote bags, and more! We are budgeting $2,000 for the initial costs of these items.
Turns out an online bookstore costs a pretty penny. From hosting the website to the point of sales system to licensing and professional membership fees the initial start-up fees will run about another $5,000. 

The Impact
I want this to be a truly communal space where the customers help us create our community. Where people tell us what they would like us to add or incorporate and we do our best to make those things happen. This is a collaboration. And while we cannot promise to cover everything we want to be open to ideas and growth. Having an eclectic team and support system, it is imperative that Subverting Expectations bring a little bit of everything to this space for my fellow eclectics to embrace all aspects of themselves. From access to politicians, to talks about sex, to discussing current events, to learning new make-up trends, I want to create a space where everyone feels welcome, valued, and comfortable to explore new things. 

Risks & Challenges
As an independent online bookstore, it may be difficult for us to stand out and compete against a larger online retailer who shall not be named. However, we know that we offer something unique and that there has been a move to shop and support small businesses. We know that we will have to adjust and adapt as necessary and as we get to know what our community requires and desires. While there will be difficult times, we are committed to making this dream a reality. This will be a journey & we are excited to have you along for the ride.

<h3>velo peaches – Bicycle repair and shop </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are Ana, Mischa and Jovi and together we are velo peaches, a new feminist bike repair shop opening soon in Vienna.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three of us are trained bike mechanics and have worked in different workshops and bike related projects in Vienna, Graz and Novi Sad (Serbia). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you help us achieve?</strong> </p>
<p>Opening a  queer feminist bike repair shop, of which we hope to be more than a repair workshop</p>
<p>We see the need for a more feminist approach to cycling and bike mechanics. We really want to empower FLINTA* (Female*Lesbian*Intersex*Non-Binary*Trans*Agender*) persons to get independence on the bicycle. We also want to give space for more education for FLINTA* mechanics and make the information reachable for everyone. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal with the crowdfunding </strong></p>We are aiming for 10,000 euros to go towards our renovation costs and buying all the bike tools we are going to need for the workshop.<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you!</strong></p>
<p>With every donation we will give you a ""forever place"" at velo peaches! With a donation you will get your name stamped on the tool that will be used in the workshop.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>WHY A FEMINIST BIKE SPACE?</p>
<p> After working in different bicycle spaces and companies we have seen the patriarchal structures at work, felt our voices being taken away from us, never mind the tools from our hands. We have decided that instead of trying to change the exsisting structures in bicycle workshops, we would rather create our own space. We have all experienced more than once that FLINTA* persons, mechanics as well as customers, are not taken seriously in bike and repair shops. Sometimes the male dominated space creates the feeling that the male voice is the expert voice and that there is no further discussion. FLINTA* customers can be cajoled into buying something or pressured into making decisions that are not explained or given background knowledge on. </p>
<p>FLINTA* persons need a space to learn and express their technical abilities and practice them without being judged and questioned. It is  our vision that velo peaches will be that space.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>It's a risk to put all our money and time into buiding Velo Peaches, but no risk, no fun. Of course there will be many obstacles to overcome. Which is why we work hard not just at building the outer exterior but a strong base together to communicate honestly. We are building velo peaches with love and respect for each others voices, lifting each other up and supporting each other. More then just wanting to be successful monetarily we want to succeed in working together. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Dont worry if you cannot contribute financially to our Crowdfunding. If you want to help but don't have the capacity to give towards our financial goal, just let us know. We are in need of lots of different things for building up and opening velo peaches.</p>
<p>Please forward and share our campaign and let others know about what we are doing. Support feminist bike spaces!</p>

<p>Negli ultimi anni abbiamo assistito ad una crescita esponenziale di interesse verso il bio, favorendo una <strong>maggiore sensibilità nei confronti di prodotti più salutari, ecologici e cruelty free</strong>.

<h3>Quali servizi fornirà la nostra azienda?</h3>

I box saranno costruiti con materiali all’avanguardia per poter avere, di per sé, una buona barriera isolante sia per il freddo che per il caldo. Saranno dotati di webcam, per videosorveglianza, ma anche per poter dare la possibilità al proprietario di osservare il proprio cane. Nella decorazione della struttura abbiamo scelto un approccio basato sulla <u>cromoterapia</u>, proprio per rendere l’ambiente ancora più propenso ad un sano relax. Dotata di impianto di filodiffusione per <u>musicoterapia</u> per ridurre i livelli di ansia e di stress per cani che non sono abituati ad essere lontani dalla famiglia, con i quali al bisogno si utilizzeranno anche sistemi di vaporizzazione di oli essenziale per <u>aromaterapia</u>. I box sono immersi nel verde, e la loro pulizia e sanificazione sarà effettuata utilizzando <u>prodotti eco sostenibili</u>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Piscina per cani estiva:</strong> una piscina per cani all’aperto da poter utilizzare sia a scopo ludico con il proprio referente umano, oppure a scopo <u>idroterapico</u> per recupero motorio e/o mantenimento muscolare con un esperto del settore.</li>

<p><strong><u>HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR DREAM:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>A MULTIPURPOSE HOLISTIC DOG CENTRE</u></strong>!</p>
<p>We will be the first multipurpose Dog Centre in Italy based on the importance of the environment,on organic produce and holistic therapy.</p>
<p><strong><u>Why believe in our project?</u></strong></p>
<p>In recent years we have become aware of an exponential  increase in interest   in an organic way of life, a greater sensitivity regarding healthier, eco- and cruelty- free products. Many people have moved towards these products because they are better for our health and our well-being and also because we have bcome more aware of our environment. <strong>A product without chemical additives, antibiotics, toxic metals, and one which helps the environment is no small thing!</strong> This interest obviously is also centred on the well-being of our four-footed friends, who are a part of our family. Millions of families around the world have a pet, and also a considerable interest in their well-being and health. Because of this our company aims to provide services with minimal environmental impact, and with a holistic approach while caring for these animals. The word “<strong><i>Holistic</i></strong> “comes from the Greek word “HOLOS”, meaning “the whole, global”. This definition encompasses all the numerous aspects and factors which affect health and well-being-in this case our animal friends. We take into consideration the context in which they live, their food, habits, psychophysical equilibrium, their ability to manage emotional  stress and their relationships with humans or other animals. We work on prevention,  on balance both in body and mind,in emotion and energy.</p>
<p><strong><u>Which services will our company supply?</u></strong></p>
<p>We need to enlarge our facility to set up new services for animal well-being. We have already started some services, which are known and recognized locally:</p>
<p>-One-to-one and group courses  (dog handling at home and in the urban environment) basic and advanced training, courses for correct socializing, for well-informed adoption awareness, courses for new mums and pregnant mums, group walking.</p>
<p>-Dog sporting activities, to reinforce the relationship between dog and owner and for  psychophysical well-being : Rally Obedience, Obedience, Dog Agility, Treibball, Dog Cross Country and Maintrailing.</p>
<p>-Rehabilitation of difficult dogs in collaboration with dog shelters and kennels</p>
<p>-Dog seminars and traineeships</p>
<p>Funny Dog has decided to increase its services, thanks also to the help of other professionals.</p>
<p>We should like to include the following:</p>
<p><strong>-Dog boarding kennels:</strong> a facility specially created for their well-being and safety, and also to accommodate dogs  who are more difficult to approach. The facility will comprise day and night time quarters, where the dogs can rest and sleep,but also the possibiliy of fenced gardens, where they can run, play and socialize with other dogs under the strict supervision of an expert. The kennels will be constructed with state of the art materials which have an insulating barrier for both heat and cold. They will be equipped with a webcam with CCTV for safety, but also to enable the owner to see his or her dog.  We used a chromotherapy based approach when decorating the kennels to make the environment more relaxing. We have installed pipelines for music therapy to reduce anxiety and stress levels for dogs who are not used to being away from home. If needs be these can also be used as vaporising systems with essential oils for aromatherapy. The kennels are surrounded by nature, and are cleaned and sanitized using eco-friendly products.</p>
<p><strong>-Summer swimming pool for dogs:</strong> an outdoor swimming pool for recreational purposes with a  trainer, or for hydrotherapeutic purposes such as motor recovery or muscle maintenance with an expert in the field.</p>
<p><strong>-Room with rehabilitaion tubs for muscle building:</strong>water tubs for post-surgery rehabilitation, for specific pathologies or for muscle maintence, with an expert in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Dog Training Centre:</strong> There are two fields for individual and group dog training. Our training method is based exclusively on <strong>positive reinforcement</strong> and never uses a coercive approach.</p>
<p><strong>Holistic clinics:</strong> Polyclinics for “complementary” medicine. With vets and other experts in the field, who work with acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractice, flower therapy, nutrition, homeopathy and other natural therapies.</p>
<p><strong>Grooming:</strong> dog and cat grooming using eco friendly soaps. Ozone therapy baths  with aromatherapy for total relax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What  we need and what you’ll get!</u></strong></p>
<p>We will implement the project in steps. Our first task is to fence off the whole perimeter and all the fenced areas where the dogs will be trained, the structure for the kennels and the pool-so that we can enjoy spring and summer right away!</p>
<p>The €10,000 raised by our crowdfunding scheme will go towards the costs for green areas: bushes, trees, meadow and flowers will be planted. We have found that there is sufficient space for about 180 native trees.</p>
<p>With your donation you <strong>will help make our facility (and the planet!)</strong> greener-as the trees grow, they will absorb more CO2, and protect the soil and its biodiversity</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What will you have in return?</u></strong></p>
<p>By adopting us you will have a discount voucher or a pass for our services! (If you don’t live locally, we can offer you lots of other services online)</p>
<p>To thank you we shall use the usual social networks, but also give a plant your name!!</p>
<p>Other ways you can help us.</p>

- Corsi individuali e di gruppo: educazione base (Gestione del cane in casa e in ambiente urbano) e avanzata, giusta comunicazione tra il cane e referente umano, corsi per cuccioli, recupero caratteriale (aggressività, fobie…), corsi per una socializzazione corretta, corsi per adozioni consapevoli, corsi per neo mamme o mamme in gravidanza, passeggiate di gruppo- Sport cinofili, per rafforzare il rapporto con il proprio cane e per il loro benessere psico-fisico: Rally Obedience, Obedience, Agility Dog, Cani Cross, Maintraling...- Recupero cani problematici in collaborazioni con canili- Seminari e stage di cultura cinofila
I nuovi servizi, verranno effettuati grazie anche alla collaborazione di altre figure professionali. Tra i servizi che vorremmo proporre ci saranno:


Pensione per cani: in una struttura creata appositamente per il loro benessere e la loro sicurezza, anche per poter ospitare quei cani più difficili da approcciare. La struttura sarà costituita da box con zona giorno e notte, nei quali i cani potranno sostare per riposare e dormire, ma con la possibilità di giardini recintati dove poter correre, giocare e socializzare sempre sotto la super visione di un esperto. I box saranno costruiti con materiali all’avanguardia per poter avere, di per sé, una buona barriera isolante sia per il freddo che per il caldo. Saranno dotati di webcam, per videosorveglianza, ma anche per poter dare la possibilità al proprietario di osservare il proprio cane. Nella decorazione della struttura abbiamo scelto un approccio basato sulla cromoterapia, proprio per rendere l’ambiente ancora più propenso ad un sano relax. Dotata di impianto di filodiffusione per musicoterapia per ridurre i livelli di ansia e di stress per cani che non sono abituati ad essere lontani dalla famiglia, con i quali al bisogno si utilizzeranno anche sistemi di vaporizzazione di oli essenziale per aromaterapia. I box sono immersi nel verde, e la loro pulizia e sanificazione sarà effettuata utilizzando prodotti eco sostenibili.

Piscina per cani estiva: una piscina per cani all’aperto da poter utilizzare sia a scopo ludico con il proprio referente umano, oppure a scopo idroterapico per recupero motorio e/o mantenimento muscolare con un esperto del settore.

Locale con vasche per la riabilitazione e per il potenziamento muscolare: vasche con acqua per riabilitazione post operatoria o in casa di patologie e/o per lavorare su un mantenimento muscolare, sempre con un esperto del settore.

Centro di Educazione Cinofila: la struttura è dotata di due campi per l’educazione cinofila e di gruppo. Il nostro metodo di addestramento si basa esclusivamente sul rinforzo positivo e non utilizza alcun metodo coercitivo.

Ambulatori olistici: Poli ambulatori per le medicine definite “complementari”. Con la presenza di medici veterinari e altri esperti del settore, che operano in agopuntura, osteopatia, chiropratica, floriterapia, nutrizione, omeopatia e molte altre discipline della naturopatia.

Toelettatura: toelettatura per cani e gatti con l’utilizzo di saponi bio e ecosostenibili. Vasche per l’ozonoterapia con l’utilizzo dell’aromaterapia per bagni che siano un totale relax.

Bar per cani e umani: sala relax per chi deve attendere il suo turno per un servizio. Ovviamente con prodotti bio!! 



Cosa ci occorre e cosa ottieni?
Per la realizzazione del progetto procederemo a step. Il primo step sarà realizzare tutta la recinzione perimetrale, i recinti dove verrà effettuata l’educazione del cane, la struttura della pensione per cani e la piscina. 
I 15.000 Euro raccolti da questa campagna di crowdfunding contribuiranno a coprire i costi del verde: in tutto il terreno verranno piantate piante, siepi, arbusti, prato e fiori. Abbiamo constatato che sia possibile piantare sui 180 alberi autoctoni.
Quindi con la tua donazione, oltre che ad aiutarci, contribuirai a rendere più verde la nostra struttura (e il pianeta!) - Crescendo, l’albero assorbirà CO2, proteggerà il suolo e la biodiversità!

Cosa avrai in cambio?
Con la tua donazione riceverai un buono sconto o un pass per i nostri servizi! (Se non sei della zona, abbiamo anche molti servizi online da offrirvi!)
Altrimenti se non vuoi usufruire dei servizi puoi solo donare facendo un'offerta libera!

HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR DREAM:
A MULTIPURPOSE HOLISTIC DOG CENTRE!
We will be the first multipurpose Dog Centre in Italy based on the importance of the environment,on organic produce and holistic therapy.
Why believe in our project?
In recent years we have become aware of an exponential  increase in interest   in an organic way of life, a greater sensitivity regarding healthier, eco- and cruelty- free products. Many people have moved towards these products because they are better for our health and our well-being and also because we have bcome more aware of our environment. A product without chemical additives, antibiotics, toxic metals, and one which helps the environment is no small thing! This interest obviously is also centred on the well-being of our four-footed friends, who are a part of our family. Millions of families around the world have a pet, and also a considerable interest in their well-being and health. Because of this our company aims to provide services with minimal environmental impact, and with a holistic approach while caring for these animals. The word “Holistic “comes from the Greek word “HOLOS”, meaning “the whole, global”. This definition encompasses all the numerous aspects and factors which affect health and well-being-in this case our animal friends. We take into consideration the context in which they live, their food, habits, psychophysical equilibrium, their ability to manage emotional  stress and their relationships with humans or other animals. We work on prevention,  on balance both in body and mind,in emotion and energy.
Which services will our company supply?
We need to enlarge our facility to set up new services for animal well-being. We have already started some services, which are known and recognized locally:
-One-to-one and group courses  (dog handling at home and in the urban environment) basic and advanced training, courses for correct socializing, for well-informed adoption awareness, courses for new mums and pregnant mums, group walking.
-Dog sporting activities, to reinforce the relationship between dog and owner and for  psychophysical well-being : Rally Obedience, Obedience, Dog Agility, Treibball, Dog Cross Country and Maintrailing.
-Rehabilitation of difficult dogs in collaboration with dog shelters and kennels
-Dog seminars and traineeships
Funny Dog has decided to increase its services, thanks also to the help of other professionals.
We should like to include the following:
-Dog boarding kennels: a facility specially created for their well-being and safety, and also to accommodate dogs  who are more difficult to approach. The facility will comprise day and night time quarters, where the dogs can rest and sleep,but also the possibiliy of fenced gardens, where they can run, play and socialize with other dogs under the strict supervision of an expert. The kennels will be constructed with state of the art materials which have an insulating barrier for both heat and cold. They will be equipped with a webcam with CCTV for safety, but also to enable the owner to see his or her dog.  We used a chromotherapy based approach when decorating the kennels to make the environment more relaxing. We have installed pipelines for music therapy to reduce anxiety and stress levels for dogs who are not used to being away from home. If needs be these can also be used as vaporising systems with essential oils for aromatherapy. The kennels are surrounded by nature, and are cleaned and sanitized using eco-friendly products.
-Summer swimming pool for dogs: an outdoor swimming pool for recreational purposes with a  trainer, or for hydrotherapeutic purposes such as motor recovery or muscle maintenance with an expert in the field.
-Room with rehabilitaion tubs for muscle building:water tubs for post-surgery rehabilitation, for specific pathologies or for muscle maintence, with an expert in the field.
Dog Training Centre: There are two fields for individual and group dog training. Our training method is based exclusively on positive reinforcement and never uses a coercive approach.
Holistic clinics: Polyclinics for “complementary” medicine. With vets and other experts in the field, who work with acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractice, flower therapy, nutrition, homeopathy and other natural therapies.
Grooming: dog and cat grooming using eco friendly soaps. Ozone therapy baths  with aromatherapy for total relax.
 
What  we need and what you’ll get!
We will implement the project in steps. Our first task is to fence off the whole perimeter and all the fenced areas where the dogs will be trained, the structure for the kennels and the pool-so that we can enjoy spring and summer right away!
The €10,000 raised by our crowdfunding scheme will go towards the costs for green areas: bushes, trees, meadow and flowers will be planted. We have found that there is sufficient space for about 180 native trees.
With your donation you will help make our facility (and the planet!) greener-as the trees grow, they will absorb more CO2, and protect the soil and its biodiversity
 
What will you have in return?
By adopting us you will have a discount voucher or a pass for our services! (If you don’t live locally, we can offer you lots of other services online)
To thank you we shall use the usual social networks, but also give a plant your name!!

<h3>A Little Bit About Us</h3>
<p>My name is McKenzie Crawford and I am the owner of Books and Bakery LLC. I was born and raised in Carroll, Iowa. The town is near and dear to my heart. It is where I knew I wanted to start my future business, where I wanted to buy my first home, and where I wanted to start my family. I am now grown up and am living those dreams. My fiancé and I bought our first home in Carroll, September of 2019. We are raising our two wonderful, little boys in our family home. I feel incredibly blessed to be able to live and work in this community.</p>
<p>When I was a little girl, I often dreamt of one day running a bookstore. As I grew, that dream expanded, warped, and altered. As a teenager, I went vegan and my bookstore dream turned into wanting to run a bookstore and café or bakery combination. I was often told to get my head out of the clouds, as that dream is too far fetched. However, here we are. Making my dreams a reality and bringing bookstore magic to Carroll areas and beyond. Our online store has been busy and shipping orders all around the United States. We are ready for our next adventure as a new bookstore (one day bakery as well) in downtown Carroll, Iowa.</p>
<p>My brother, Alex, has been my best friend since we were little kids. Alex is autistic and happens to be non verbal as well. He graduated high school this year and was ready for his next adventure! Alex wanted to get right to work after graduation, so he attempted to join a local program that assists those with disabilities in a work place environment. While sitting on a waitlist for said program, Alex and I continued to work closely together. With the help of my wonderful younger brother, this one woman operation turned into a lovely family business. Alex works hard to ensure our new business is always accommodating for those who need extra supports and assistance. With that, his goals and dreams had also warped, changed, and grew.</p>
<p>With help from you, our dreams and goals can continue to grow and help us spread happiness and magic through the world of books.</p>

After all alterations and updates, the rest of our money will go towards a variety of book and sideline inventory. </p>
<p>The store will need some loving and TLC. Alex and I are ready to put in the love, soul and work to our storefront. We need your help to fund a lot of that love and soul.  </p>

What happens if we don't reach it in full? The money donated will go into the storefront, however not to the extent we have in our plans. All perks will still be received by our contributors. If we raise more than our goal, all excess will go towards more extensive inventory for the shop and our marketing.</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
