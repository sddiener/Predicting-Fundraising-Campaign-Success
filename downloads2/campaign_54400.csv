0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>I worked for over 40 years as an Engineer and Project Manager on large industrial projects, most of the time in a big office with hundreds of other engineers, designers, and other specialists. Every day at lunchtime most of us would rush out for an hour or so to a local eatery, have a quick lunch, and hurry back to work. There were always a few folks who stayed back at the office, having brought leftovers or a pre-packaged meal. </p><p>I never thought about it much until I had to have a knee replaced [apparently 50 years of golf will do that - who knew?] and found myself bringing my lunch to work while my knee recovered from surgery. And I discovered why some people preferred to bring their lunch. The office was nearly empty, it was quiet and calm, people were relaxed and amicable, some even took quick naps, and that was the single most pleasant hour of the day. I became a bring-my-lunch-to-work person too, and that's when I soon discovered there was a downside to bringing your lunch,</p><p>Most people brought food that needed to be refrigerated until lunchtime, and then heated up for consumption. The company provided refrigerators and microwaves on every floor for this, usually in the coffee bar area. But these were always overused- the fridges were jammed full every morning, and I had to find a spot to stuff my lunch in and subsequently dig it out later. And the microwaves were even worse. Since it took a few minutes to heat a meal, there was always a wait in line until my turn, and the microwave always had a blend of food odors from the last few users that was often, well, let's just say ""unappetizing"".</p><p>My office didn't allow mini-fridges or personal microwaves, and they took up too much room anyway, so we all just endured the situation. Then I had an idea. I remembered a friend who had a little travel cooler, about 6-pack size, that plugged into the car cigarette lighter, and realized I could get one of those and a voltage converter and hide them under my desk and keep my lunch cool there instead of the company fridge. I did that, and it worked. I had to package my food so it would fit, but it did the trick.  I used this for over a year, although I still had to use the office microwave.  </p><p>Two features of this little cooler were especially significant.

Every day at lunchtime most of us would rush out for an hour or so to a local eatery, have a quick lunch, and hurry back to work. There were always a few folks who stayed back at the office, having brought leftovers or a pre-packaged meal. I never thought about it much until I had to have a knee replaced [apparently 50 years of golf will do that - who knew?] and found myself bringing my lunch to work while my knee recovered from surgery. And I discovered why some people preferred to bring their lunch. The office was nearly empty, it was quiet and calm, people were relaxed and amicable, some even took quick naps, and that was the single most pleasant hour of the day. I became a bring-my-lunch-to-work person too, and that's when I soon discovered there was a downside to bringing your lunch,Most people brought food that needed to be refrigerated until lunchtime, and then heated up for consumption. The company provided refrigerators and microwaves on every floor for this, usually in the coffee bar area. But these were always overused- the fridges were jammed full every morning, and I had to find a spot to stuff my lunch in and subsequently dig it out later. And the microwaves were even worse. Since it took a few minutes to heat a meal, there was always a wait in line until my turn, and the microwave always had a blend of food odors from the last few users that was often, well, let's just say ""unappetizing"".My office didn't allow mini-fridges or personal microwaves, and they took up too much room anyway, so we all just endured the situation. Then I had an idea. I remembered a friend who had a little travel cooler, about 6-pack size, that plugged into the car cigarette lighter, and realized I could get one of those and a voltage converter and hide them under my desk and keep my lunch cool there instead of the company fridge. I did that, and it worked. I had to package my food so it would fit, but it did the trick.  I used this for over a year, although I still had to use the office microwave.  Two features of this little cooler were especially significant. It cools very quickly, and it doesn't require complex controls because it uses thermoelectric chilling, a simple heat-pump technology that produces very cold temperatures very quickly. Unlike conventional freon-cycle systems that require hours to cool down and must be run continuously I only needed to run it for a few hours in the morning. And TE chilling is self-limited in that it can only cool down 30-40 degrees below ambient [room] temperature, which works out to ideal refrigeration temperature.  TE chilling doesn't scale up economically, so it's not used for full size or compact refrigerators or air conditioners, but it's perfect for small duties such as this.

<h3>Clean Wine Benefits Everyone</h3>
<p>A quick look into the benefits of wine are pretty well-known-the top two being a reduced risk for heart disease and stroke. However, if you dig a little deeper you will find that many of the additives used by many commercial wine producers are detrimental to your health. Topping the list are stabilizers (i.e. acetaldehyde, dimethyl dicarbonate) which can be poisonous, followed by sulfites (can cause a headache), and clarifiers. All of these are chemicals touted to preserve the quality of the wine. You then have pesticides such as carbaryl, daconil, imidocloprid, and countless others being sprayed routinely on the vines and fruit. They do their job, but some becomes mixed with stormwater runoff, and the rest goes into the wine we drink. Yuck.</p>
<p>I can speak as a 20-year veteran of the landscape industry that most of the pesticides we use today make their way into the food chain, and with dire repercussions for some. This is why I have chosen to start this initiative. Sound gardening practices start and end with what is native to the planet, and the wine produced here will be nothing more nor less. The result is a product that is safe, nutritious, healthy, and will go toe-to-toe with any mainstream wine produced.....but it doesn't stop there.</p>
<p>The entire complex needs to follow suit. For what good is it if the wine is organic, but the facility and processes to make it are polluting? This is why we aim to be fully sustainable in all areas from grape production to energy use to bottling. It's smart, responsible, and the simply the right thing to do.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$500,000.00 is the goal. It's what must be raised for this campaign to be a success. The image below contains both a complete itemized budget for each facet of the project, as well as a timeline for completion. The very first item on the list is the success of this campaign. In return for your contribution, some very generous perks have been developed (some of which are worth more than the contribution amount needed to qualify).</p>

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>It only takes a spark to light a fire. Likewise, it only takes a vineyard to change an industry, and a changed industry to influence a culture. Your help can lead to a cleaner planet and an industry-wide renaissance to old-world winemaking where the final product is truly healthy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing the best grapes despite the risk of adverse weather will likely be my biggest challenge. My two decades of landscaping and horticultural experience will prove beneficial in how to properly care and nurture the fruit. My professional training via The GA Dept. of Agriculture has allowed me to learn these practices. You can verify my certification at  <a href=""http://www.kellysolutions.com/ga/applicators/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kellysolutions.com/ga/applicators/</a> . I plan on consulting with one of the state's viticulturists via my local GA Extension offices should problems extend beyond my level of expertise.</p>
<h3>Pressing Q &amp; A</h3>
<p>Q: Why isn't wine a perk?</p>
<p>A: Per Indiegogo's Terms of Use, no form of alcohol can be issued as a perk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Where in the South Piedmont Region of GA do you want to establish the vineyard, and why?</p>
<p>A: We feel the best location to be in Henry County, GA due to the climate, soil conditions, and topography. Economically, it is in one of the fastest growing regions in the state, and is in close proximity to both the cities of Atlanta and Macon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What kind of wine do you plan on producing?</p>
<p>A: Blanc du Bois, Norton, Lenoir, Merlot, and Muscadine will be our initial offerings for table wine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I don't want to invest in something that may fail. How do you plan on sustaining a profit if you have a bad year (i.e. Inclement weather decimates the grape crop)?</p>
<p>A: Additional means of revenue will be available such as guided tours, and renting out the grounds as an event space. Wine tastings will be offered upon the release of our first wines.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I've heard of people using crowdfunding contributions to line their own pockets, and not follow through with the project they presented—thieves! I want to contribute, but trust needs to be established. How can I trust you?</p>
<p>A: For each leg of this project, at least two update videos will be posted—one at the start, and one upon completion. Additionally, I understand that from the backer's point of view that no one wants to be swindled. So here you go....If I for any reason do not follow through with this project upon receiving funding, feel free to proceed with legal civil action against me for fraud. My word is my bond.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What about permits, licensing, marketing, and administrative costs?</p>
<p>A: These costs are included in the budget for each leg of the project. An example would be that the land budget of $300000.00 includes the cost of the land, closing costs, planning &amp; zoning fees, all taxes, and any other real estate charges incurred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Does this project give back to help the local community in any way?</p>
<p>A: Yes! We plan on acting as a destination for local school districts to bring their students for educational field trips. Students would learn about agriculture, farming, sustainability, clean energy solutions, and mathmatics (among other topics) in a fun, hands-on environment.</p>

<p>Hello, My name is Michael DePaolis, a Chef/ Entrepreneur/Health and Fitness enthusiast.  Nutrition in America is broken, more about that in a minute. I have spent the past nine years operating my company Paleo Power Meals, a successful gourmet healthy meal prep company servicing so many customers, mainly on the east coast! This includes everyone from Professional Athletes in every sport to the fitness industry to the everyday individual.  The time has come to take clean eating nationwide to each and every doorstep in the country!  </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<u><strong>PROBLEM</strong></u> </h3>
<p>Back to the issue of Nutrition in America.  The U.S obesity epidemic is obviously a major issue but it is also complex.  Consumers are sent mixed messages when it comes to nutrition and portion control. Between larger portions, processed packaged food, mainly consisting of simple carbohydrates, sugar, and other shelf-stable products. Ads are constantly pushing the convenience of drive-thru meals typically branded as fast, cheap, filling, and delicious.  Now add Covid19 into the mix with social distancing, limited trips to the grocery store, not to mention working from home, and homeschooling your children, all of which leads to poor decision-making, opting for convenience over healthier alternatives.</p>

</div></div>","STORY
Hello, My name is Michael DePaolis, a Chef/ Entrepreneur/Health and Fitness enthusiast.  Nutrition in America is broken, more about that in a minute. I have spent the past nine years operating my company Paleo Power Meals, a successful gourmet healthy meal prep company servicing so many customers, mainly on the east coast! This includes everyone from Professional Athletes in every sport to the fitness industry to the everyday individual.  The time has come to take clean eating nationwide to each and every doorstep in the country!  
 

 

PROBLEM 
Back to the issue of Nutrition in America.  The U.S obesity epidemic is obviously a major issue but it is also complex.  Consumers are sent mixed messages when it comes to nutrition and portion control. Between larger portions, processed packaged food, mainly consisting of simple carbohydrates, sugar, and other shelf-stable products. Ads are constantly pushing the convenience of drive-thru meals typically branded as fast, cheap, filling, and delicious.  Now add Covid19 into the mix with social distancing, limited trips to the grocery store, not to mention working from home, and homeschooling your children, all of which leads to poor decision-making, opting for convenience over healthier alternatives.

Here are just some of the long term health effects of a poor diet and obesity:
Type 2 Diabetes
Weakened Immune system
Heart Disease
Certain Cancers
Depression
High blood pressure (Hypertension)
High LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia)
Stroke
Sleep Apnea
Liver Disease
Gallbladder disease.
Osteoarthritis (a breakdown of cartilage and bone within a joint)
Along with so many other issues that will keep you busy with Doctor visits!

 
OUR SOLUTION
I created Just Eat Clean to help eliminate the confusion and guesswork of which nutritional lifestyle to choose from by focusing on just eating clean, healthy natural ingredients that come from the earth. Now you can have healthy clean fresh pre made delicious meals conveniently delivered free nationwide direct to your doorstep with no menu planning, grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning. Meals arrive fresh, never frozen, and ready-to-eat in just three minutes. By eating this way, you can also drastically improve your overall health and well-being, thus helping decrease your risk for many of the health issues noted above. 

 
HOW IT WORKS
The ordering process will be very simple.  We will have the following Meal Plan options available for you to choose from:

Our menu changes seasonally and rotates weekly. There are always a wide variety of meals to choose from, keeping it interesting. All meal plans ship out weekly and can be changed up, put on hold, or canceled at any time. 

Italian Chicken Thighs with Garlicky Kale and Roasted Butternut Squash, Pulled Pork Carnitas with Red Slaw and Plantains, All Natural Ground Turkey and Broccoli Bowl, Meatloaf with Sautéed Broccoli and Cauliflower Mashed

<h3>My name is Duane Harper, I love coffee!</h3>
<p>I used to work in the oil industry for over 35 years, I was laid off 3 years ago and discovered that it was time to make a change in careers (as there is no more jobs in that industry), at age 55 that is not easy. </p>
<p>I have a passion for making coffee, and I love to drink coffee and try different kinds of coffee.  I first started making cold brewed coffee and discovered how good it was.  Then I heard about nitrogen infused cold brewed coffee and I had to try it.  I searched all over Edmonton to find some and discovered that no one makes it, most people haven't even heard about it.  So.... I did the research, found out how its made and bought all the equipment necessary to make it.  It's fantastic!  This is my new career, but I need to get it out there.  I sold coffee during the 2017 market season at Cheer events, the White Barn Market, at the Cannabis and Hemp show, Edmonton Night Market, Zoo Brew, at an Easters Seals event and at Canada Day at the Legislature grounds.</p>
<p>For the 2018 season I have a couple of events scheduled, but I need more.  Events and markets have entrance fees which are prohibitive to someone who is just starting out.  That is why I am asking for help with funding.  I have put a lot of time and money into this business so far and I think one really good season would help me grow.  I need $5900.00 to pay for entrance fees and to buy and inverter to power my equipment.</p>
<p>Any contribution you can make will help.  For every contribution of $10.00 I will send you a certificate for a free coffee, for any contribution of  $400.00 I will come to your event (wedding, grand opening, party, etc) and serve coffee.  If you can't make a contribution, please share with others about my campaign.</p>

<p>With the legalization of cannabis in Canada, new and returning users are flooding the market. The products available today are not the same as weed from 70’s and 80’s. Today’s strains are much more potent and edibles are generally lacking in dosage instructions. We’re likely to see a lot of overconsumption in the short term.</p>

<p>Stats show that around 20% of Canadians have used cannabis in the last year and 40% are considering doing so once it's legal. So here we are folks, October 17th. The day some have been waiting for and others have been dreading. Whether you like legalization or not, with over 11 million Canadians already using or considering cannabis, this is something we can’t ignore. </p>

<p><strong>Risks and Challenges </strong></p>
<p>We’ve got some start up experience under our belt, so we know how difficult and daunting it is to bring something to market, but when it involves a whole new industry that was just previously illegal… well you could say that’s a little intimidating. But we’re not backing down, we believe with the right information and openness to conversation, Canadians can embrace the cannabis industry for all that it is. Whether it’s for fun, health, or nostalgia.</p>
<p>While we are not a controlled substance and everyone and their dog could consume Mallow, we know there is a negative connotation to those who work in and alongside the Cannabis Industry, and that’s why we’re doing this!</p>
</div></div>","Mallow is an organic drink made with ingredients specifically sourced to alleviate some of the symptoms of unintended heights. Whether it’s sugar, caffeine or THC, when you overindulge, things can get uncomfortable. And when that happens, you’ll want Mallow on hand, so we're bringing it to you. The Big Trip is a cross Canada Tour.

Disclaimer: Mallow does not contain any controlled substances. Mallow does not intend to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or illness.

Because we're over the shaming, stigma, and stereotypes of cannabis use. Cannabis users are high functioning, hard working professionals, we are creators and innovators, we are focused, driven, intelligent, and that is something to celebrate! With your help we will come out to your town and celebrate with our very own DJ, block parties, and general good times. 


With the legalization of cannabis in Canada, new and returning users are flooding the market. The products available today are not the same as weed from 70’s and 80’s. Today’s strains are much more potent and edibles are generally lacking in dosage instructions. We’re likely to see a lot of overconsumption in the short term.


 

Stats show that around 20% of Canadians have used cannabis in the last year and 40% are considering doing so once it's legal. So here we are folks, October 17th. The day some have been waiting for and others have been dreading. Whether you like legalization or not, with over 11 million Canadians already using or considering cannabis, this is something we can’t ignore. 

With little regulation involved in producing edibles, it's easy to over-consume and once that happens it’s too late, you’re in over your head. Sweating, heart racing, dry mouth, and panic. You’d do anything at that point to feel better. Before Mallow, you just had to ride it out.

With just the click of a button you can set the ""clean cycle"" on the app.   We designed Bluprint to be the centerpeice of your kitchen, while taking up minimal space.  At just under 14 inches tall, Bluprint fits under most kitchen cabinets.       Bluprint Coffee Maker (Your choice of color: Blue, Mint Green, Rose Gold, White)  Premium access to the Bluprint App Permanent washable filter and pre-measured coffee scoop Double-walled stainless steal carafe that keeps coffee hot (and fresh!) for up to 4 hours Before starting Bluprint, we were not coffee aficionados. We were working professionals that found happiness in our morning coffee routines. Once we started working from home, we were looking for an upgrade to our coffee maker. After several hours of reading countless Amazon reviews, we were paralyzed by too many choices and no brand that really spoke to the emotional attachment we had to our morning coffee routine. That's why we created Bluprint, a direct-to-consumer drip coffee maker featuring minimalist design and smartphone integration for simplified programming. No more confusing knobs and buttons.   After countless design iterations in our quest to create the perfect coffee maker, we finally completed the prototype testing and now we are are ready to start on tooling and production.    After our successful Indiegogo campaign we will immediately begin tooling which will take approximately 6-8 weeks. Following production and quality assurance we plan to ship by end of October 2021.    New to Indiegogo? We are here to help. Follow these simple steps to get your Bluprint:1. Create an Indiegogo account or log in to existing account2. Navigate to the Bluprint page (you're here now!)3. Click the ""back this project"" button4. Select your reward5. Complete your payment6. We will reach out to you to confirm your color choice (Blue, Mint Green, Rose Gold, or White) After countless surveys, customer interviews, and consultation with top coffee experts, we are confident that we have the best coffee maker features you are asking for. We haven’t rushed through design nor initial prototyping, which has allowed us to perfect the product.We are confident with our estimated ship dates, but in this current environment things can change. Who would have thought that a ship would block the Suez Canal and cause delays? What we can promise is communication! Any updates, any changes, any delays, will be conveyed to you, so you are always in the loop.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>ZenMug: the Italian hand made stylish mug</h3>
<p>What is ZenMug? It's a handmade, 100% Italian mug. But, more than this, it's, basically, our idea of relax. It's more than just a mug, it's a fusion of sensations, where the outer wood part, warm and natural, meets the ceramic shiny inner part, in a melting pot of feelings on your hands and lips. The taste of coffe, tea or your favorite beverage is now accompanied by a new range of sensations!</p>
<p>ZenMug is completely customizable and every single mug is unique and intimately yours. You can choose your wood between different types (we actually have linden and teak, but more are coming!) and every single mug is carved from a different raw piece so none is similar to another. The inner cercamic part and the top cap, both hand made in ceramic, can be chosen in different colors (white and black so far, but we are working to have new pigments soon) to have your own combination of wood&amp;stone. </p>
<p>Your ZeMug will be unique, in every single part, like you. Are you ready for your new ZenMug?</p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We are three young professionals with proven, exceptional skills in our daily job that want to bring something different to market.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Green Pet is a 100% plant-based cruelty-free dog food. It is hypoallergenic, cholesterol-free, and eco-friendly. Green Pet helps dogs have a healthier and happier life.</p>
<p>Dogs are omnivores, like human beings, so their diets can be completely based on vegetables.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that dogs fed with vegetable-based diets are much less prone to have skin allergies, heart diseases or digestive problems.</p>
<p>We are working on a prototype of the food, and our plan is to start producing it during 2019.</p>

<h3>Meet Green Pet, the healthy and eco-friendly food for your furry friend</h3>

<p>Many investigations carried out by important organizations such as PETA state that 100 % vegetable-based dog food is much healthier than regular dog food based on meat and preservatives, because dogs fed with vegan food are less prone to suffer from skin, heart, or stomach diseases, or even cancer.</p>

<p>My name is Sébastien and I have been in the restaurant industry for 31 years now. I started as a dishwasher when I was 14 and now after having suffered through a very bad experience, Traiteur Le Vrai Nord was started. We are beginning our journey and urge you to lend us a hand. </p>
<p>I found that, being a single father, I wanted to improve the quality of life for my children. The goal for the company is to bring good, healthy, local and sustainable food to your tables. We are offering chef at home services, party planning, meal planning, cooking classes and most likely more to come. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a certified Red and Blue seal trained chef, and have always been passionate about food, its history, its provenance and the techniques that come with all of it. I believe that the purer the food the better. We are going to offer all manner of artisanal preserves, meats, terrines and the likes.</p>
<p>What I am looking for from all of you , is a little help in getting equipments. There are a few things we are missing to get fully going.</p>
<p>I am also asking for some funding that will act as a security blanket in the slow time.</p>
<p>Food I believe is one of those comforts none of us they do without. It is a labor of love and passion. Food brings us all together, brings us a sense of family. So please give us a hand.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>Kara’s Organic Chimichurri – Delicious &amp; Wholesome</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are looking for something healthy to snack on or something savory to satisfy your cravings, you can serve up Kara’s Chimi Chimi anywhere. A knockout at parties, chimichurri is the perfect sauce that you probably have never tried yourself.  Originating from Argentina, chimichurri is made from parsley, garlic, vinegar, and other natural ingredients. Chimichurri is widely known for marinating meats and serving alongside meat dishes. Kara’s Chimi Chimi brings meat dishes to life and can be used for dipping chips and vegetables too. It can also be served as a spread or a condiment on tacos, salads, sandwiches and so much more. </p>
<p>Tired of the same old sauces giving your foods the same old flavors? We were too, and that was why we set out to make something different, our very own chimichurri that we could use as a universal sauce.</p>
<p><strong>What makes our Chimichurri different?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike most Chimichurris you find at stores, Kara's Chimi Chimi is </p>
<ul>
<li>Refrigerated</li>
<li>Organic </li>
<li>Creamy (dairy free!)</li>
</ul>
<p>A zesty and garlic-y compliment to all of your grilled meats, sandwiches, dips.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing: Kara's Chimi Chimi</strong></p>
<p>The story is a familiar one that moms across the world can relate to. Armed with a passion for good food and natural ingredients and most importantly 3 picky eaters, Jean set out to make a chimichurri sauce; with a twist.</p>
<p>Her daughters who began eating her cheese sticks, vegetables, pita chips dipped in this sauce loved it so much she put some into containers to give to her friends to help them also eat their vegetables.</p>
<p>And so Kara’s Chimi Chimi was born.</p>
<p>Following her daughter's creativity, Jean in addition to serving her own unique blend of all natural ingredients as a condiment to grilled meats, started making sandwiches, salads, tacos, eggs - pretty much anything that benefited from a flavor kick - to her friends and their kids with such an enormous response she decided to begin sharing this with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Currently carried in local small markets and butcheries but can be ordered online.  Hopefully will be in a grocery store near you.</p>
<p><strong>Certified Organic</strong></p>
<p>We have gone through the extra steps in order for Kara's Chimi Chimi to be USDA Certified Organic.  So if you like to know where your food is coming from and what standard the ingredients are held to, you can have the utmost confidence when enjoying this sauce. You never have to feel like you are going into the kitchen (or the grocery store) blind again, every container of Kara's Chimi Chimi carries the USDA Certified Organic seal so you know that we're using the best ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Vegan, Kosher, Halal, Keto-Friendly</strong></p>
<p>Not only is Kara’s Chimi Chimi superior in taste and texture, it is also meets all the dietary requirements above…jam packed with so much goodness!</p>
<p>You can enjoy it on anything – without worrying that you are crossing any of your own personal boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Non-GMO</strong></p>
<p>Of course, this would go without saying, USDA Organic Certified also means Non-GMO. From the start, we have wanted this sauce to stand for quality and the values that we seek out in food ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Gluten-Free &amp; Dairy-Free</strong></p>
<p>Even though our Chimichurri is creamy, it is completely dairy free and gluten free so you can rest assured that you can fearlessly enjoy. </p>
<p><strong>Made to Share</strong></p>
<p>Each container of Kara's Chimi Chimi features a wide mouth, making dipping and sharing easy. On the go, in the office, or at home with your loved ones, Kara's Chimi Chimi is just the sauce that you want to have stocked in your fridge, something that everyone can enjoy together – totally guilt-free! </p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are turning to you to help raise funds to manufacture, market, and distribute Kara's Chimi Chimi on a larger scale.</p>
<p>We've made great strides in the last few months but still need some help to get the word out.</p>
<p>Our goal through this campaign is to raise $5,000 to cover costs that we are facing as we take this special sauce and bring it to the Organic foods world.  One of the greatest challenges that we currently looking to solve is getting it into retail outlets so it's easily available for pick up anytime.</p>
<p>To show our appreciation for all your support, we are honored to offer special discounts to Kara's Chimi Chimi exclusively through this campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Anytime you launch a food product, safety is the number-one concern, we are working with reputable kitchens and manufacturers for the production of Kara's Chimi Chimi. We will work hard to keep the standard of quality high even as we scale up. If any other logistical challenges arise during the manufacturing and distribution processes, we will figure out a way to innovate and move forward all the while keeping our contributors updated regarding our progress.</p>

A zesty and garlic-y compliment to all of your grilled meats, sandwiches, dips.
Introducing: Kara's Chimi Chimi
The story is a familiar one that moms across the world can relate to. Armed with a passion for good food and natural ingredients and most importantly 3 picky eaters, Jean set out to make a chimichurri sauce; with a twist.
Her daughters who began eating her cheese sticks, vegetables, pita chips dipped in this sauce loved it so much she put some into containers to give to her friends to help them also eat their vegetables.
And so Kara’s Chimi Chimi was born.
Following her daughter's creativity, Jean in addition to serving her own unique blend of all natural ingredients as a condiment to grilled meats, started making sandwiches, salads, tacos, eggs - pretty much anything that benefited from a flavor kick - to her friends and their kids with such an enormous response she decided to begin sharing this with the rest of the world.
Currently carried in local small markets and butcheries but can be ordered online.  Hopefully will be in a grocery store near you.
Certified Organic
We have gone through the extra steps in order for Kara's Chimi Chimi to be USDA Certified Organic.  So if you like to know where your food is coming from and what standard the ingredients are held to, you can have the utmost confidence when enjoying this sauce. You never have to feel like you are going into the kitchen (or the grocery store) blind again, every container of Kara's Chimi Chimi carries the USDA Certified Organic seal so you know that we're using the best ingredients.
Vegan, Kosher, Halal, Keto-Friendly
Not only is Kara’s Chimi Chimi superior in taste and texture, it is also meets all the dietary requirements above…jam packed with so much goodness!
You can enjoy it on anything – without worrying that you are crossing any of your own personal boundaries.
Non-GMO
Of course, this would go without saying, USDA Organic Certified also means Non-GMO. From the start, we have wanted this sauce to stand for quality and the values that we seek out in food ourselves.
Gluten-Free & Dairy-Free
Even though our Chimichurri is creamy, it is completely dairy free and gluten free so you can rest assured that you can fearlessly enjoy. 
Made to Share
Each container of Kara's Chimi Chimi features a wide mouth, making dipping and sharing easy. On the go, in the office, or at home with your loved ones, Kara's Chimi Chimi is just the sauce that you want to have stocked in your fridge, something that everyone can enjoy together – totally guilt-free! 

What We Need & What You Get
Right now, we are turning to you to help raise funds to manufacture, market, and distribute Kara's Chimi Chimi on a larger scale.
We've made great strides in the last few months but still need some help to get the word out.
Our goal through this campaign is to raise $5,000 to cover costs that we are facing as we take this special sauce and bring it to the Organic foods world.  One of the greatest challenges that we currently looking to solve is getting it into retail outlets so it's easily available for pick up anytime.
To show our appreciation for all your support, we are honored to offer special discounts to Kara's Chimi Chimi exclusively through this campaign.
An Entrepreneurial Dream -The Female Trio

Risks and challenges

<p>My name is Kiauna Terrell and I am a Personal Chef/ Caterer and food truck owner from Washington, DC. Food has always been my passion and I have been blessed to make it my career. I spent a lot of time with my grandmother who had a catering business for over 30 years. As a child growing up I was exposed to many different types of food and it was heaven!!! I knew since I was 5 years old what I wanted to do when I grew up. Rather than going outside to play I would sit on the kitchen floor at the door waiting for my Grandmother to ask me to help. As I got older I was able to go on catering jobs …I can remember watching the peoples pleasurable reactions while eating my Grandmothers food and thinking to myself ""If only I can be half as good as her and bring smiles to peoples faces through food"". After years of hard work, blood, sweat, and tears I have been able to live my dream and feed many people and watch that same reaction time and time again!!! I now have 20 years of catering/food experience under my belt and am learning and loving this business more and more each day.</p>
<p>Ever think about investing in a small town on the rise? Rocky Mount NC, has a lot of history and charm and some amazing properties that are ready to be bought!!!! The construction for The Rocky Mount Event Center is underway and it is unlike any event center in Eastern NC.(As televised on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel) The 160,000 square foot facility costs $36and a half million dollars to build and is going up in part of the downtown undergoing a revitalization. The city manager says once open it will bring an economic impact to the city of about $264 million dollars in the next 10 years. Along with the revitalization of Down Town Rocky Mount, these two big projects are going to bring in new residents and visitors alike…….And I want to get in on the ground and be apart of the growth!!!</p>

<p>About a year ago I moved from Washington, DC with my two pups and my Food Truck for a new start in this charming little town and fell in love. Upon doing some research I learned that one of the biggest sports centers in Eastern NC has started construction and is set to open in 2018. This huge project is going to bring in visitors from all over along with plenty of revenue and jobs to this town and I want to be apart of it. The new center is being built a few blocks from downtown Rocky Mount on Main St. and the buildings are dirt cheap!!! I came across this empty lot in the center of Main St. and immediately a light bulb went off and my creative juices started flowing!! This would be the perfect spot for an Alfresco Wine/Beer and Food Garden. Picture this…… A beautiful outdoor space with plenty of fresh flowers and greenery some cool quirky seating a pleather a of local beers and wine and of course the savory sweet smells coming from Sassy Sandwiches Food Truck….A perfect gathering space for the community after work, on the weekends and it could also be rented out for special occasions…And of course, it will be dog-friendly!!!

<p>The city of Rocky Mount is giving business owners many incentives to build and bring their businesses to the Down Town area. The lot that I found is $35,000. This 2,396 sq. ft. lot sits between 2 existing buildings. The construction of this project will consist of building a back wall along with large wood/steel sky beams, A floor, and a High front security gate. Sassy Sandwiches would be located towards the back and next to it a manufactured building for storage and prep work with plumbing and electricity. A second manufactured building will hold a unisex restroom with plumbing and electricity. I would need to install year-round seating and tables and of course, no garden is complete without beautiful greenery landscape and flowers.

<h3>eat:em bar</h3>
<p>We've developed a natural, tasty and healthy cricket bar. The recipe is simple: crickets, cocoa beans, cashews, almonds, dates and coconut oil. We now need your help with funding for the first batch. We promise to deliver an honest bar with a great purpose. Back us!</p>
<h3><strong>3 reasons to eat crickets</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1. Crickets are efficient protein factories</strong></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/344/996/4aa7cf824cc1873c241039563fbcc979_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1519482143&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ec919e0fd3832bedadbd7577cb8f57b5"" src=""""/><div> </div>
<p>Crickets need a very small area to grow. This makes them easy to include in already existing agriculture. It is also possible to feed them plants that are not sold to humans because of their blemishes. Crickets are also over 10x more efficient than cattle when it comes to converting feed into protein.</p>
<p><strong>2. Crickets don't eat sprayed food</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/344/969/a13ff1af03fbf51510419ae58e14bd57_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1519481876&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=90c884560f00c54de84b91da2b61b46d"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A lot of the food we eat everyday are being sprayed with chemicals. The food our crickets eat are not sprayed with insecticides because that would kill them. Crickets therefore contains less toxins than most of the vegetables we eat.</p>
<p>Well then, what does crickets eat? Non-sprayed carrots, ecological food waste and other vegetables. So fresh!</p>
<p><strong>3. Crickets are like meat - without being like meat</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/020/344/982/590b148999c45ecdaffe84b27dffba8d_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1519481993&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=85d9ce86955dd05d85309156cf5d1fc8"" src=""""/> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Crickets are rich in protein, iron, zinc, vitamin b12, magnesium and calcium - exactly as meat. These are minerals and vitamins you need to feel good and stay healthy. But the best part is that eating crickets doesn't have the same drawbacks as red meat, which increases the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our main challenges is to grow and develop products without outside investors. We believe that independence is crucial for us in order to be focus on sustainability and health over profits. This  campaign is very important for our future independence.</p>
<p>We are certain that we will be able to deliver bars if the campaign is successful. The recipe is ready, production is ready. We just need help with funds for the first batch.</p>

We've developed a natural, tasty and healthy cricket bar. The recipe is simple: crickets, cocoa beans, cashews, almonds, dates and coconut oil. We now need your help with funding for the first batch. We promise to deliver an honest bar with a great purpose. Back us!
3 reasons to eat crickets
1. Crickets are efficient protein factories
 
Crickets need a very small area to grow. This makes them easy to include in already existing agriculture. It is also possible to feed them plants that are not sold to humans because of their blemishes. Crickets are also over 10x more efficient than cattle when it comes to converting feed into protein.
2. Crickets don't eat sprayed food

A lot of the food we eat everyday are being sprayed with chemicals. The food our crickets eat are not sprayed with insecticides because that would kill them. Crickets therefore contains less toxins than most of the vegetables we eat.
Well then, what does crickets eat? Non-sprayed carrots, ecological food waste and other vegetables. So fresh!
3. Crickets are like meat - without being like meat
 

Crickets are rich in protein, iron, zinc, vitamin b12, magnesium and calcium - exactly as meat. These are minerals and vitamins you need to feel good and stay healthy. But the best part is that eating crickets doesn't have the same drawbacks as red meat, which increases the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease.
Ingredients

Risks and challenges
Our main challenges is to grow and develop products without outside investors. We believe that independence is crucial for us in order to be focus on sustainability and health over profits. This  campaign is very important for our future independence.
We are certain that we will be able to deliver bars if the campaign is successful. The recipe is ready, production is ready. We just need help with funds for the first batch.

<div>Do you know that about 500 billion disposable cups are used around the world every year while, on average, it takes only 15 minutes to drink a coffee? However, these 15 minutes of holding a cup of coffee in your hand are extremely costly since they require large quantities of raw materials, crude oil, wood, water, energy etc. All of these are needed for production of a disposable cup. What is more, the energy used to produce these billions of cups contributes to global warming. In the end, after these 15 minutes, the coffee cup ends up in garbage and pollutes the environment.</div>

<div>With the help of a new sealing technology, we have succeeded in developing a telescopic, collapsible drinking cup made of stainless steel. In addition to this and due to a new safety technology, it cannot collapse inadvertently while you drink.</div>

<p>First we decided to raise money for the final optimization and improvement of the prototype.

<p>We have to put a higher price on our cup and set a high funding goal to keep our backers from being disappointed. Our goal is to produce <strong>we-kupp </strong>cups in batches while providing affordable pricing on our product.</p>
<p>All crowdfunding line cups will have a special sign engraved on them distinguishing its owner for making it possible for <strong>we-kupp</strong> to be produced!</p>
<p>Besides, more and more coffee shop chains are opting for sustainability and will reward you with a discount if you bring your own reusable cup (in Austria and Germany, you will get a 50-euro-cent discount (approx.

<p>In addition, we have developed an innovative coffee cup sleeve (transport case) for coffee cups which can also be used for other reusable and disposable cups. It protects the hands from both heat and cold in cases of warm or cold drinks. Moreover it's very pleasant to touch due to special materials. The sleeve has been designed in a minimalistic style and is available in different colours. Because of its small size you can always take it with you. It contains an additional compartment for various cards, which you can always use when ordering. The sleeve is reusable and durable, which means that the number of paper sleeves for disposable cups can be significantly reduced.</p>

<p><strong>Disposable cups</strong>: Their production is resource-consuming; moreover, all the resources used for the production end up polluting the environment. They can hardly be recycled. Sooner or later, policy makers will enforce a ban on disposable products made of plastic. Disposable cups will be driven out of the market permanently. Consequently, more and more people are starting to overthink their consumption habits.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong>: The production of disposable cups is resource-consuming and requires large quantities of raw materials, crude oil, wood, water, energy etc. To produce 16 billion paper coffee cups, 4 billion gallons of water are used and 6.5 million trees are cut down.</p>
<p><strong>Disposal</strong>: Less than 1% of the disposable cups produced can be recycled. The rest are sent to landfills, incinerated, or pollute the environment. Disposable paper cups contain 5% polyurethane plastic which helps prevent leaking. This makes composting and recycling of disposable cups extremely difficult because it is a mixed material and not 100 % paper.</p>
<p><strong>Use</strong>: The use of some types of disposable cups may have a negative impact on human health.</p>
<p><strong>Other collapsible cups</strong>: On the one hand, the range of collapsible cups is not wide at all. On the other hand, the quality of the existing cups made of stainless steel is barely satisfactory, and they aren’t really suitable for hot beverages because they are not leak-proof and may collapse accidently when used for drinking. Moreover, none of the existing cups is properly heat-insulated to protect your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Reusable cups</strong>: Other reusable cups won’t catch on as they are cumbersome and not really space-saving which makes it uncomfortable to carry them around once you’ve finished your beverage.</p>
<p><strong>Deposit-refund systems</strong>: Deposit-refund systems are difficult to implement widely; at best, they can be implemented regionally. No standardized concept is possible.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dig The Roots is the small company that my friend and I created. We started with selling our creations on the street to local customers. All started after I moved from Germany to the US and found out that there is no snack besides fresh fruit that I can eat. Through a metabolic disease called HPU (inherited) I'm unable to eat foods that contain <strong>Dairy</strong>, <strong>Gluten</strong> and <strong>Histamine</strong>. So I decided to create a snack which is not only delicious and allergy friendly but also enjoyable for everyone. </p>
<p>The snacks are based on organic oats with different fruits, vegetables and organic sweetener.</p>
<p>Through this metabolic issue I was challenged to find new ways not only for cooking but as well for dealing with difficulties that emerge not being able to eat outside in a restaurant or café.

<p>Additionally I want to make aware of this metabolic disease, give people with allergies the chance of enjoying foods delicious and allergy friendly.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So my friends here it is, we need $17500 to build this beautiful Café in Los Angeles. With our own money and your help we are on a good way to our first location, the funds will be used to buy commercial kitchen equipment. An oven, dishwasher, cooler, kitchen supplies and dishes. We want to keep the cost low through hard work and doing as much as possible on our own and upcycling old furniture that will be used as café inventory. </p>
<p>We have many different perks you can choose from. Starting at one free meal to some great Dig The Roots t-shirts and sweaters.

We want to support the thought of eating <b>Vegan, Gluten free </b>and <b>Histamine free</b>, not only for the lifestyle but for the need. </p>
<p>Additionally we will set up a online store where you can purchase these snacks if your not living near LA. So everyone in this great country can enjoy them. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Dig The Roots is the small company that my friend and I created. We started with selling our creations on the street to local customers. All started after I moved from Germany to the US and found out that there is no snack besides fresh fruit that I can eat. Through a metabolic disease called HPU (inherited) I'm unable to eat foods that contain Dairy, Gluten and Histamine. So I decided to create a snack which is not only delicious and allergy friendly but also enjoyable for everyone. 
The snacks are based on organic oats with different fruits, vegetables and organic sweetener.
Through this metabolic issue I was challenged to find new ways not only for cooking but as well for dealing with difficulties that emerge not being able to eat outside in a restaurant or café. And because I'm not the guy who sits cries and complains, I decided to do something about this uncommon problem. So I spend many hours in the kitchen creating this snack and to find the perfect consistence and taste. 
Through my love of cooking ( I cook every day and every meal) it was able for me to gather a lot of knowledge about foods which are free of gluten, dairy and histamine. Through that practice I was able to find ways to make these foods taste with only a few options. 
Additionally I want to make aware of this metabolic disease, give people with allergies the chance of enjoying foods delicious and allergy friendly. And I want to create employment not only through the Café but also with local farmers and crafters. With your help and my friend I want to create a space where you can eat, talk to friends or just enjoy a delicious snack with a cup of coffee. 
You can help to create the first Café that is Vegan, Gluten free and Histamine free.

<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
<p>Viking Mead Ltd was founded by husband and wife team Alistair and Deborah Morgan. The couple live on a small farm on the Shetland Islands in the middle of the North Sea approximately 100 miles north of the Scottish mainland. Having brewed beer and wine as a hobby for some time, it was while touring some of the islands' ancient Norse settlements that inspiration struck. Alistair began researching the brewing techniques and ingredients used by the islands' ancient inhabitants, discovering the significance of Mead in Norse culture and mythology. The couple sensed an opportunity to bring this legendary drink to a modern audience and Viking Mead was born.</p>

<p>""Tomato ideal"" brand 100% tomato juice for the whole family</p>
<p>Lycopene in tomato juice is called ""gold in plants""!</p>
<p>At present, tomato juice is popular in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The antioxidant capacity of lycopene is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.</p>
<p>""Tomato ideal"" brand 100% Xinjiang tomato juice contains at least 20mg lycopene per can, which is equivalent to the lycopene absorption of 400 tomatoes raw!</p>
<p> The price of drinks, the experience of nutrition!Just one can, protect your health!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our bodies rust every day, you know?</p>
<p>Our car will be maintained regularly, but our most precious body is often ignored!It has become the norm for Chinese people to make money with their bodies when they are young and to buy their lives when they are old.Why don't you take good care of yourself when you are young?Make money at the same time must take good care of the body, if you ignore it, it will slowly betray you... Pro, must remember!According to the survey, although the life expectancy of Chinese people has been extended, about half of the people over 65 years old in China have been taking a variety of drugs due to different diseases. Most of the elderly spend their days in the hospital intermittently.</p>
<p>However, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, many people&amp;apos;s suffering from diseases can be prevented through maintenance in middle age or controlled by nutrition adjustment now.</p>
<p>In the United States, there are more and more ""senior citizens"" who are in good physical and mental condition. They are always healthy and full of vitality. We can see them in tennis courts, adult education classes, gymnasiums, and sometimes even in professional places.Researchers have conducted research on these elderly people who have a good old age and found that the maintenance carried out as early as middle age is the cornerstone of their good health after old age!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It&amp;apos;s better to keep in good health in advance than to spend money on treatment</p>
<p>When the ruddy complexion quietly fades away, the wrinkles of years climb up the woman&amp;apos;s face; when the energy is overdrawn for a long time, the pressure of career makes men unable to do what they want; when the heart and brain function is failing day by day, parents always have to face the threat of vascular sclerosisWe can&amp;apos;t help asking: what steals our health?</p>
<p>British scientists have pointed out: iron will rust, silver will turn black, in fact, the human body will rust.The aging process of human body is similar to that of cut apple, which is the result of oxidation.Many chronic diseases of human beings are caused by oxidative stress, that is, the human body is rusting every day. The ""rust"" produced is called ""free radical"" in medicine, which is the root of many diseases of human body.Environmental pollution, life pressure, radiation and other factors are ""oxidizing"" our bodies all the time, reducing human life expectancy.""Oxidation"" is the main culprit that deprives people of health in life, and it is an important factor that leads to human aging and health problems!Experiments show that animals with low oxidative metabolism rate and strong antioxidant capacity are not easy to get sick, stronger and have the longest life span.</p>
<p>With the increase of age, our self-healing ability becomes weaker, and the damage caused by free radicals is manifested, such as wrinkles, color spots, poor energy, organ aging, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cataract, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&amp;apos;s disease, arthritis, cancer, etc., which are considered to be related to free radicals.</p>
<p>With the improvement of living standards, the popularization of nutrition knowledge and the improvement of health care awareness, the harm of chronic diseases related to diet is not only valued by the state and society, but also aroused people&amp;apos;s general concern. The concept of ""prevention is more important than treatment"" has gradually replaced the habit of ""treating diseases only when they are sick"".</p>
<p>Our goal is not to turn back the clock, but to live the best quality of life at the age of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and even 100!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>""Wolf peach"" in South America becomes a new favorite of European and American family maintenance</p>
<p>Tomato, which is rich in nutrition and delicious, is known as the fruit delicacy and the ruby of green world.It is said that the hometown of tomato is in Peru and Mexico. It was originally a wild berry growing in the forest. It was originally called ""wolf peach"". The fruit is rich in nutrition and has a special flavor.According to records, in the 16th century, a Duke of England named orodala was traveling in South America. He liked tomatoes very much, so he brought them back to England as a gift of love to his lover Queen Elizabeth to express his love.Since then, the names of ""love fruit"" and ""lover fruit"" have been widely spread.Europeans began to plant tomatoes in courtyards and gardens, and as a symbol of love and friendship gifts between men and women.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Time of the United States selects the food that contributes the most to human health</p>
<p>American ""time"" magazine introduced many kinds of food which are beneficial to modern people&amp;apos;s health, among which tomato ranked the first.Tomato is rich in antioxidants, which can prevent the damage of free radicals to the skin. It has obvious effects of beauty, anti wrinkle, anti-aging, improving energy, protecting organs, and can greatly reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Tomato juice is very popular in European and American countries. It is said that Americans who pay attention to health care should drink two things when they wake up in the morning and before going to bed at night: one is milk, and the other is tomato juice.According to statistics, the per capita consumption of tomatoes in European and American countries is more than 30 times of that in China. In particular, 100% pure tomato juice has become an essential maintenance product for the whole family in European and American families.Drinking a glass of tomato juice every day brings obvious benefits to the maintenance oriented European and American people.The old people often drink it to delay aging, protect heart, brain, prostate and other important organs. The men often drink it with vigorous energy, while the women often drink it to beautify and beautify the skin, remove wrinkles and spots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>200g tomato juice, supplement the whole body nutrition</p>
<p>At present, tomato has been proved to contain a variety of vitamins and nutrients, rich in vitamin C and a, folic acid, potassium these main nutrients.In particular, it contains lycopene, it really has the effect of love, can make girls more beautiful!We see that loving and scientific mothers tend to make their children eat more tomatoes.According to the nutritionist&amp;apos;s research and determination: each person eats 200 grams of tomato juice every day, which can protect the human health system and meet the human body&amp;apos;s needs for a variety of vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p> Tomato juice is rich in vitamins, alkalis, cellulose and pectin, and is rich in lycopene. Lycopene is the strongest antioxidant, which can delay aging, beautifying beauty, improving energy and enhancing immunity. The higher the content of lycopene in human plasma, the lower the incidence rate of cancer and coronary heart disease.</p>
<p> Tomato juice contains a variety of organic acids. In addition to protecting vitamin C from damage, organic acids can also soften blood vessels, promote the absorption of calcium and iron, and help stomach juice digest fat and protein, which is beyond other vegetables and fruits;</p>
<p> Tomato juice also contains a kind of anti-cancer and anti-aging substance called glutathione. Studies have found that tomato juice can prevent some types of cancer, inhibit breast cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer, and also fight lung cancer and colon cancer;</p>
<p> Lycopene has the effect of diuresis and inhibiting the growth of bacteria. It is an excellent antioxidant and can remove free radicals in human body;</p>
<p> Tomato juice also has the effect of beauty, appetite, protein digestion, reduce stomach distension.Its characteristics are between fruits and vegetables, rich in vitamin A and C. due to the protection of organic acids, vitamin C can not be destroyed in tomato cooking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant in nature</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1913Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant found in plants in nature, was first found in cooked tomatoes.Its antioxidant capacity is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.Science has proved that the free radicals in human body are the main culprits of human autoimmune system.Lycopene is more effective than other carotenoids and vitamin E in scavenging free radicals, and its rate constant of quenching singlet oxygen is 100 times that of vitamin E.It is of great significance to prevent skin aging, prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, prostate diseases, remove garbage in the body, enhance the human immune system and delay aging.It can effectively prevent and treat various diseases caused by aging and immune decline.Therefore, it is concerned by experts all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drinking cooked tomato juice is the best way to supplement lycopene</p>
<p>Lycopene is known as ""gold in plants"".At present, lycopene has been widely accepted in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.A cup of cooked tomato juice every day has become the living habit of high-quality families, and cooked tomato juice has become the top maintenance product for European and American families!</p>
<p>Lycopene widely exists in various organs and tissues of human body.It is mainly distributed in human blood, adrenal gland, liver, testis, prostate, breast, ovary, uterus, digestive tract and other organs, in which blood, adrenal gland, liver and testis contain more lycopene.Moreover, the content of lycopene in human body is related to human life span.Lycopene can also inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein and resist ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan have produced lycopene as the main active ingredient of drugs, its main role is to reduce blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, high blood lipid, reduce the activity of cancer cells.Lycopene is used to prevent prostate cancer in the United States and France.Israel and Australia have products used to prevent ultraviolet burns, protect skin, strengthen skin and nourish beauty.</p>
<p>The human body can&amp;apos;t make lycopene, so it needs to take it from the diet. Eating a raw tomato can only absorb 0.05 mg of lycopene; only the tomato juice with proper ripening degree can greatly improve the absorption of lycopene through wall breaking technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The strongest antioxidant in the plant world</p>
<p>Delaying aging and enhancing immunity</p>
<p>Beautify and nourish the face, remove the rubbish in the body</p>
<p>Protect the prostate, protect the heart and brain</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Powerful tomato juice, you can&amp;apos;t expect the maintenance effect</p>
<p>Tomato juice is rich in lycopene, which has a variety of maintenance functions. Many families in Europe and the United States take natural tomato juice for a long time. Many people at the age of 40 can have a 20-year-old body, and those at the age of 60 can have a 40-year-old body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Delaying aging and enhancing immunity</p>
<p>The aging of human body is closely related to the lack of lycopene. At the age of 40, it is the best time to prevent the aging and physical diseases. The way is to supplement lycopene.One lycopene molecule in tomato juice can quench tens of thousands of free radicals, and its antioxidant capacity is 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.It can effectively eliminate free radicals in human body, maintain normal metabolism of cells and prevent aging.Lycopene is absorbed in the body through the digestive tract mucosa, enters the blood and lymph, distributes to the testis, adrenal gland, prostate, pancreas, breast, ovary, liver, lung, colon, skin and various mucosal tissues, promotes the secretion of hormones by glands, so as to keep the human body vigorous; eliminates the free radicals in these organs and tissues, protects them from injury, and enhances the immunity of the bodyPestilence makes people less likely to get sick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Italy confirmed that prevention and inhibition of cancer</p>
<p>One of the important mechanisms of tumorigenesis is that tissue cells undergo gene mutation under the action of external mutagens. Lycopene in tomato juice can block this process, effectively quench free radicals, and achieve the role of tumor prevention.For the formed tumor, it can promote intercellular signal transmission, inhibit and differentiate, induce cancer cells, and make them correct.</p>
<p>In Greece, Italy and other Mediterranean countries, where residents often eat barbecue food, barbecue food is easy to induce cancer.However, the incidence rate of cervical cancer, prostate cancer and liver cancer is low in this area.Because local people often eat tomato products - tomato juice and ketchup.Tomato juice is a necessary drink for them to roast fish and meat.This diet method reduces the mutagen effect in fried and baked food, and greatly reduces the cancer incidence.One of the main reasons for the formation of cancer cells is the sudden malignant transformation of genes by tissue cells under the action of external mutagens.Lycopene can inhibit the mutation process and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>The Italy Medical Research Institute used Lycopene in tomato juice to prevent cancer. It has been proved that lycopene can reduce the incidence rate of various cancers, especially the decrease of esophageal, gastric, colon and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>A comparative study conducted by the University of Illinois in the US found that incidence rate of cervical cancer is 5 times higher in women with low lycopene content than those with high lycopene in vivo.</p>
<p>The researchers studied 93 cases of lung cancer patients and 102 cases of non tumor controls, and detected the concentration of lycopene in the blood. The results showed that the concentrations of various nutrients in the blood of the two groups were similar, only lycopene was different. The concentration of lycopene in the tissues of lung cancer patients was significantly lower than that of the control group.</p>
<p>In this study, 26 patients with prostate cancer waiting for surgery were divided into two groups: one group took lycopene extracted from tomatoes, 15 mg twice a day; the other group did not take lycopene.Three weeks later, I was surprised to find that in patients taking lycopene, the tumor size was significantly reduced, and some were almost eliminated.</p>
<p>Improving cataract and age-related macular degeneration</p>
<p>According to Marius palman of the University of Wisconsin in the United States, compared with people with low blood lycopene concentration, people with high blood lycopene concentration are 50% less likely to develop age-related macular disease</p>
<p> </p>
<p>10 European countries found that the protection of heart and brain</p>
<p>Lipoprotein oxidation is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis.Lycopene plays an important role in reducing lipoprotein oxidation.It can remove vascular garbage, regulate plasma cholesterol concentration, inhibit arteriosclerosis formation and protect LDL from oxidation.It can also repair and improve the oxidized cells, promote the formation of intercellular glia, and enhance the flexibility of blood vessels.</p>
<p>According to reports, oral lycopene rich tomato juice can reduce serum cholesterol to below 5.20 mmol / L, which can slow down the development of cardiovascular disease.According to the research reports of 10 European countries, it is concluded that the intake of 30 mg lycopene per day can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>""News network"" once reported the experiment of 150 heart disease patients in Cambridge University of England: if they were given lycopene supplement every day for 4 consecutive weeks, the patients&amp;apos; low density cholesterol was significantly reduced, and the side effects were reduced compared with the lipid-lowering drugs, which confirmed that lycopene had a significant effect on the prevention of moderate wind and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Strong anti alcohol effect</p>
<p>The main metabolic process of alcohol in human body is redox reaction, which produces a lot of free radicals.Taking lycopene at ordinary times can increase the amount of alcohol; taking lycopene before drinking can relieve alcohol damage to liver; taking lycopene after drinking can relieve headache, vomiting and other drunken symptoms.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Improve allergy</p>
<p>Lycopene can greatly improve skin allergy, eliminate dry skin and itching caused by skin allergy, and make people feel relaxed and happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Protection of mucosal tissue</p>
<p>Lycopene is abundant in various mucosal tissues in the body. Long term administration can improve various discomfort caused by the destruction of mucosal tissues in the body.Such as dry cough, dry eyes, oral ulcer, protection of gastrointestinal mucosa tissue.</p>
<p>In addition, lycopene also has many physiological functions, such as preventing osteoporosis, lowering blood pressure and reducing exercise-induced asthma.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Little tomato juice protects men&amp;apos;s prostate health</p>
<p>With the growth of age, the rapid decline or lack of lycopene in men&amp;apos;s prostate and blood will not be able to resist the erosion of free radicals on cell tissue, especially the damage to prostate tissue.The rapid loss of lycopene is the core of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is the key to the long-term treatment of prostate disease.Once the content of lycopene in men&amp;apos;s blood drops, it is easy to have dysuria, low back and perineum, lower abdominal acid, distending pain, poor energy, insomnia, amnesia, decreased resistance and other systemic adverse symptoms.</p>
<p>There are many layers of reticular fibers outside the male prostate, which are difficult to have inflammation or bacteria, but common drugs are difficult to work after infection.Lycopene in tomato juice can break through the prostate absorption barrier and directly enter the gland to play a role.In the study of carotenoids, only lycopene has a clear protective effect.Lycopene in tomato juice is transported to all organs of the body through human lipoprotein, with the highest concentration in testis, prostate and adrenal gland.It can remove the toxin that invades the prostate, so as to effectively prevent prostate lesions.Lycopene can also regulate the prostatic fluid, keep the pH value at 6-6.5, provide a comfortable environment for sperm activity, enhance sperm activity and improve male fertility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Multi country studies have proved that tomato juice is the best maintenance product for men</p>
<p>Studies have confirmed that prostate disease is closely related to the concentration of lycopene in human body.The results of a 30-year survey of 1899 middle-aged men by the University of Chicago School of Medicine showed that the lower the intake of lycopene, the higher the risk of prostate disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Canada:A six-year follow-up study of 14000 men since 1976 found that those who ate tomato juice more than five times a week had a significantly lower risk of prostate disease.</p>
<p>India:Doctors in New Delhi have shown that lycopene improves the quality of men&amp;apos;s sperm.The experiment confirmed that 23-45 years old infertile men took tomato juice containing 20 mg lycopene twice a day. After 3 months, the concentration, vitality and shape of sperm were good.</p>
<p>U.S.A:A follow-up study of 47890 medical staff conducted by Harvard University also confirmed that a large amount of lycopene intake of tomato products had a very significant negative correlation with the risk of prostate cancer, and the risk of prostate cancer decreased by 21% (up to 34%).Taking tomato juice containing 20 mg lycopene every day can effectively alleviate the disease.</p>
<p>Italy:Statistics show that the incidence rate of prostate in southern Italy is significantly lower than that in other areas, which may be related to tomato juice and tomato paste.</p>
<p>britain:Five urologists from the Department of Biochemical Sciences at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom randomly selected strong men with an average age of 42. They were asked to drink a glass of tomato juice every day for two weeks, during which their semen samples were collected.The results showed that the level of lycopene in semen, which can eliminate harmful chemical free radicals, increased significantly, ranging from 7% to 12%.Scientists infer that if a man drinks a glass of tomato juice a day, it will greatly enhance fertility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tomato juice is essential for women&amp;apos;s beauty and skin care</p>
<p>Since the 1950s, the theory of skin aging has been widely accepted in the field of Dermatology and medicine. The theory holds that the culprit of skin aging is free radicals.Free radicals are unstable oxygen molecules that destroy cells by seizing electrons.Cherie ditre, assistant professor of Dermatology and doctor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania, believes that although the original intention of free radicals is beneficial - they can kill harmful substances such as bacteria - while they proliferate, the structure of the skin is also damaged, and such damage will soon show up.Nicholas Perricone, M.D., the author of the newly published Perricone prescription, said: ""in the midday sun, it takes only 40 minutes for free radicals stimulated by UV rays to consume 80% of vitamin C stored in the human body.""</p>
<p>Skin problems can not only rely on skin care products, but also pay attention to the internal. Women&amp;apos;s body functions begin to weaken from the age of 35, and all kinds of toxins in the body gradually accumulate, which is difficult to be discharged from the body.The garbage produced by these free radicals is a kind of toxic substance, which is harmful to human aging.At this time, we need to supplement some nutrients to help alleviate the body&amp;apos;s aging speed, such as tomato juice, rich in antioxidants, can delay the aging of human body.Nowadays, people pay more and more attention to tomato beauty, mainly because tomato juice not only has good health care effect, but also has strong antioxidant effect, which can protect our skin health and beauty.</p>

Our bodies rust every day, you know?
Our car will be maintained regularly, but our most precious body is often ignored!It has become the norm for Chinese people to make money with their bodies when they are young and to buy their lives when they are old.Why don't you take good care of yourself when you are young?Make money at the same time must take good care of the body, if you ignore it, it will slowly betray you... Pro, must remember!According to the survey, although the life expectancy of Chinese people has been extended, about half of the people over 65 years old in China have been taking a variety of drugs due to different diseases. Most of the elderly spend their days in the hospital intermittently.
However, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, many people&apos;s suffering from diseases can be prevented through maintenance in middle age or controlled by nutrition adjustment now.
In the United States, there are more and more ""senior citizens"" who are in good physical and mental condition. They are always healthy and full of vitality. We can see them in tennis courts, adult education classes, gymnasiums, and sometimes even in professional places.Researchers have conducted research on these elderly people who have a good old age and found that the maintenance carried out as early as middle age is the cornerstone of their good health after old age!
 
It&apos;s better to keep in good health in advance than to spend money on treatment
When the ruddy complexion quietly fades away, the wrinkles of years climb up the woman&apos;s face; when the energy is overdrawn for a long time, the pressure of career makes men unable to do what they want; when the heart and brain function is failing day by day, parents always have to face the threat of vascular sclerosisWe can&apos;t help asking: what steals our health?
British scientists have pointed out: iron will rust, silver will turn black, in fact, the human body will rust.The aging process of human body is similar to that of cut apple, which is the result of oxidation.Many chronic diseases of human beings are caused by oxidative stress, that is, the human body is rusting every day. The ""rust"" produced is called ""free radical"" in medicine, which is the root of many diseases of human body.Environmental pollution, life pressure, radiation and other factors are ""oxidizing"" our bodies all the time, reducing human life expectancy.""Oxidation"" is the main culprit that deprives people of health in life, and it is an important factor that leads to human aging and health problems!Experiments show that animals with low oxidative metabolism rate and strong antioxidant capacity are not easy to get sick, stronger and have the longest life span.
With the increase of age, our self-healing ability becomes weaker, and the damage caused by free radicals is manifested, such as wrinkles, color spots, poor energy, organ aging, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cataract, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&apos;s disease, arthritis, cancer, etc., which are considered to be related to free radicals.
With the improvement of living standards, the popularization of nutrition knowledge and the improvement of health care awareness, the harm of chronic diseases related to diet is not only valued by the state and society, but also aroused people&apos;s general concern. The concept of ""prevention is more important than treatment"" has gradually replaced the habit of ""treating diseases only when they are sick"".
Our goal is not to turn back the clock, but to live the best quality of life at the age of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and even 100!

Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant in nature
 
1913Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant found in plants in nature, was first found in cooked tomatoes.Its antioxidant capacity is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.Science has proved that the free radicals in human body are the main culprits of human autoimmune system.Lycopene is more effective than other carotenoids and vitamin E in scavenging free radicals, and its rate constant of quenching singlet oxygen is 100 times that of vitamin E.It is of great significance to prevent skin aging, prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, prostate diseases, remove garbage in the body, enhance the human immune system and delay aging.It can effectively prevent and treat various diseases caused by aging and immune decline.Therefore, it is concerned by experts all over the world.
 
Drinking cooked tomato juice is the best way to supplement lycopene
Lycopene is known as ""gold in plants"".At present, lycopene has been widely accepted in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.A cup of cooked tomato juice every day has become the living habit of high-quality families, and cooked tomato juice has become the top maintenance product for European and American families!
Lycopene widely exists in various organs and tissues of human body.It is mainly distributed in human blood, adrenal gland, liver, testis, prostate, breast, ovary, uterus, digestive tract and other organs, in which blood, adrenal gland, liver and testis contain more lycopene.Moreover, the content of lycopene in human body is related to human life span.Lycopene can also inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein and resist ultraviolet radiation.
The United States and Japan have produced lycopene as the main active ingredient of drugs, its main role is to reduce blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, high blood lipid, reduce the activity of cancer cells.Lycopene is used to prevent prostate cancer in the United States and France.Israel and Australia have products used to prevent ultraviolet burns, protect skin, strengthen skin and nourish beauty.
The human body can&apos;t make lycopene, so it needs to take it from the diet. Eating a raw tomato can only absorb 0.05 mg of lycopene; only the tomato juice with proper ripening degree can greatly improve the absorption of lycopene through wall breaking technology.
 
The strongest antioxidant in the plant world
Delaying aging and enhancing immunity
Beautify and nourish the face, remove the rubbish in the body
Protect the prostate, protect the heart and brain
 
Powerful tomato juice, you can&apos;t expect the maintenance effect
Tomato juice is rich in lycopene, which has a variety of maintenance functions. Many families in Europe and the United States take natural tomato juice for a long time. Many people at the age of 40 can have a 20-year-old body, and those at the age of 60 can have a 40-year-old body.
 
Delaying aging and enhancing immunity
The aging of human body is closely related to the lack of lycopene. At the age of 40, it is the best time to prevent the aging and physical diseases. The way is to supplement lycopene.One lycopene molecule in tomato juice can quench tens of thousands of free radicals, and its antioxidant capacity is 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.It can effectively eliminate free radicals in human body, maintain normal metabolism of cells and prevent aging.Lycopene is absorbed in the body through the digestive tract mucosa, enters the blood and lymph, distributes to the testis, adrenal gland, prostate, pancreas, breast, ovary, liver, lung, colon, skin and various mucosal tissues, promotes the secretion of hormones by glands, so as to keep the human body vigorous; eliminates the free radicals in these organs and tissues, protects them from injury, and enhances the immunity of the bodyPestilence makes people less likely to get sick.
 
Italy confirmed that prevention and inhibition of cancer
One of the important mechanisms of tumorigenesis is that tissue cells undergo gene mutation under the action of external mutagens. Lycopene in tomato juice can block this process, effectively quench free radicals, and achieve the role of tumor prevention.For the formed tumor, it can promote intercellular signal transmission, inhibit and differentiate, induce cancer cells, and make them correct.
In Greece, Italy and other Mediterranean countries, where residents often eat barbecue food, barbecue food is easy to induce cancer.However, the incidence rate of cervical cancer, prostate cancer and liver cancer is low in this area.Because local people often eat tomato products - tomato juice and ketchup.Tomato juice is a necessary drink for them to roast fish and meat.This diet method reduces the mutagen effect in fried and baked food, and greatly reduces the cancer incidence.One of the main reasons for the formation of cancer cells is the sudden malignant transformation of genes by tissue cells under the action of external mutagens.Lycopene can inhibit the mutation process and prevent cancer.
The Italy Medical Research Institute used Lycopene in tomato juice to prevent cancer. It has been proved that lycopene can reduce the incidence rate of various cancers, especially the decrease of esophageal, gastric, colon and prostate cancer.
A comparative study conducted by the University of Illinois in the US found that incidence rate of cervical cancer is 5 times higher in women with low lycopene content than those with high lycopene in vivo.
The researchers studied 93 cases of lung cancer patients and 102 cases of non tumor controls, and detected the concentration of lycopene in the blood. The results showed that the concentrations of various nutrients in the blood of the two groups were similar, only lycopene was different. The concentration of lycopene in the tissues of lung cancer patients was significantly lower than that of the control group.
In this study, 26 patients with prostate cancer waiting for surgery were divided into two groups: one group took lycopene extracted from tomatoes, 15 mg twice a day; the other group did not take lycopene.Three weeks later, I was surprised to find that in patients taking lycopene, the tumor size was significantly reduced, and some were almost eliminated.
Improving cataract and age-related macular degeneration
According to Marius palman of the University of Wisconsin in the United States, compared with people with low blood lycopene concentration, people with high blood lycopene concentration are 50% less likely to develop age-related macular disease
 
10 European countries found that the protection of heart and brain
Lipoprotein oxidation is a key factor in the development of atherosclerosis.Lycopene plays an important role in reducing lipoprotein oxidation.It can remove vascular garbage, regulate plasma cholesterol concentration, inhibit arteriosclerosis formation and protect LDL from oxidation.It can also repair and improve the oxidized cells, promote the formation of intercellular glia, and enhance the flexibility of blood vessels.
According to reports, oral lycopene rich tomato juice can reduce serum cholesterol to below 5.20 mmol / L, which can slow down the development of cardiovascular disease.According to the research reports of 10 European countries, it is concluded that the intake of 30 mg lycopene per day can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.
""News network"" once reported the experiment of 150 heart disease patients in Cambridge University of England: if they were given lycopene supplement every day for 4 consecutive weeks, the patients&apos; low density cholesterol was significantly reduced, and the side effects were reduced compared with the lipid-lowering drugs, which confirmed that lycopene had a significant effect on the prevention of moderate wind and cardiovascular disease.
 
Strong anti alcohol effect
The main metabolic process of alcohol in human body is redox reaction, which produces a lot of free radicals.Taking lycopene at ordinary times can increase the amount of alcohol; taking lycopene before drinking can relieve alcohol damage to liver; taking lycopene after drinking can relieve headache, vomiting and other drunken symptoms.
 
Improve allergy
Lycopene can greatly improve skin allergy, eliminate dry skin and itching caused by skin allergy, and make people feel relaxed and happy.
 
Protection of mucosal tissue
Lycopene is abundant in various mucosal tissues in the body. Long term administration can improve various discomfort caused by the destruction of mucosal tissues in the body.Such as dry cough, dry eyes, oral ulcer, protection of gastrointestinal mucosa tissue.
In addition, lycopene also has many physiological functions, such as preventing osteoporosis, lowering blood pressure and reducing exercise-induced asthma.
 
Little tomato juice protects men&apos;s prostate health
With the growth of age, the rapid decline or lack of lycopene in men&apos;s prostate and blood will not be able to resist the erosion of free radicals on cell tissue, especially the damage to prostate tissue.The rapid loss of lycopene is the core of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is the key to the long-term treatment of prostate disease.Once the content of lycopene in men&apos;s blood drops, it is easy to have dysuria, low back and perineum, lower abdominal acid, distending pain, poor energy, insomnia, amnesia, decreased resistance and other systemic adverse symptoms.
There are many layers of reticular fibers outside the male prostate, which are difficult to have inflammation or bacteria, but common drugs are difficult to work after infection.Lycopene in tomato juice can break through the prostate absorption barrier and directly enter the gland to play a role.In the study of carotenoids, only lycopene has a clear protective effect.Lycopene in tomato juice is transported to all organs of the body through human lipoprotein, with the highest concentration in testis, prostate and adrenal gland.It can remove the toxin that invades the prostate, so as to effectively prevent prostate lesions.Lycopene can also regulate the prostatic fluid, keep the pH value at 6-6.5, provide a comfortable environment for sperm activity, enhance sperm activity and improve male fertility.
 
Multi country studies have proved that tomato juice is the best maintenance product for men
Studies have confirmed that prostate disease is closely related to the concentration of lycopene in human body.The results of a 30-year survey of 1899 middle-aged men by the University of Chicago School of Medicine showed that the lower the intake of lycopene, the higher the risk of prostate disease.
 
Canada:A six-year follow-up study of 14000 men since 1976 found that those who ate tomato juice more than five times a week had a significantly lower risk of prostate disease.
India:Doctors in New Delhi have shown that lycopene improves the quality of men&apos;s sperm.The experiment confirmed that 23-45 years old infertile men took tomato juice containing 20 mg lycopene twice a day. After 3 months, the concentration, vitality and shape of sperm were good.
U.S.A:A follow-up study of 47890 medical staff conducted by Harvard University also confirmed that a large amount of lycopene intake of tomato products had a very significant negative correlation with the risk of prostate cancer, and the risk of prostate cancer decreased by 21% (up to 34%).Taking tomato juice containing 20 mg lycopene every day can effectively alleviate the disease.
Italy:Statistics show that the incidence rate of prostate in southern Italy is significantly lower than that in other areas, which may be related to tomato juice and tomato paste.
britain:Five urologists from the Department of Biochemical Sciences at the University of Portsmouth in the United Kingdom randomly selected strong men with an average age of 42. They were asked to drink a glass of tomato juice every day for two weeks, during which their semen samples were collected.The results showed that the level of lycopene in semen, which can eliminate harmful chemical free radicals, increased significantly, ranging from 7% to 12%.Scientists infer that if a man drinks a glass of tomato juice a day, it will greatly enhance fertility.
 
Tomato juice is essential for women&apos;s beauty and skin care
Since the 1950s, the theory of skin aging has been widely accepted in the field of Dermatology and medicine. The theory holds that the culprit of skin aging is free radicals.Free radicals are unstable oxygen molecules that destroy cells by seizing electrons.Cherie ditre, assistant professor of Dermatology and doctor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania, believes that although the original intention of free radicals is beneficial - they can kill harmful substances such as bacteria - while they proliferate, the structure of the skin is also damaged, and such damage will soon show up.Nicholas Perricone, M.D., the author of the newly published Perricone prescription, said: ""in the midday sun, it takes only 40 minutes for free radicals stimulated by UV rays to consume 80% of vitamin C stored in the human body.""

In some areas, these tanks are very common. In other areas, they are not so common.

As described, the small 33g cartridges are disposable. They must not be refilled under any circumstance. When a disposable cartridge is empty, please put it in a steel recycling bin. It is 100% recyclable steel, a natural material and safe for the environment.</p><p><strong>There is a lot of pressure inside a CO2 tank, is the product safe to use?</strong></p><p>We have developed BubbleCap to be one of the safest carbonators on the market.

With a common PET-plastic soft drink bottle, there is a 3 to 4 times safety margin.</p><p><strong>Can you use this with a reusable bottle?</strong></p><p>You can use it with a standard PET-bottle which has contained any fizzy drink, like a normal plastic Coke bottle. These bottles are made for disposable use, but in our opinion they don't have to be disposable. They last one month with normal use (if washed well after each use, particularly the lip). The bottle holder is 1.1"" wide, so you can measure to see if it is the same diameter as your bottle.

One disposable cartridge is still a better choice for the environment than 10 disposable plastic bottles, as steel is easy to recycle, 100% natural, and safe for the environment.

<p><a href=""https://beerbottle.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>BeerBottle</strong></a> is the byproduct of a Scotland-based software developer and craft beer lover. It all started when I found myself frequently buying a variety of craft beers online; it's time consuming and expensive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea came around after a friend and I discussed the prepared variety workout meals you see advertised on the likes of Facebook. We thought we could do something similar but with a tasty mix of craft beers! <small>We often find ourselves moving the discussion from exercise to beer...</small></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're creating a platform for the folks like us to discover new beers with very little hassle. There's also the element of surprise - you won't know what's in it until you get it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal for BeerBottle is to create a simple and controllable platform for craft beer enthusiasts to discover.</p>

<p>There will be a challenge when sourcing the beer, packaging and delivery and still attempting to maintain a profitable business model and keeping the product of a great quality for starting off; due to a small amount of subscriptions we won't be able to order large quantities of beer from breweries at a discounted price.

</div></div>","BeerBottle is the byproduct of a Scotland-based software developer and craft beer lover. It all started when I found myself frequently buying a variety of craft beers online; it's time consuming and expensive.
 
The idea came around after a friend and I discussed the prepared variety workout meals you see advertised on the likes of Facebook. We thought we could do something similar but with a tasty mix of craft beers! We often find ourselves moving the discussion from exercise to beer...
 
We're creating a platform for the folks like us to discover new beers with very little hassle. There's also the element of surprise - you won't know what's in it until you get it!
 
The goal for BeerBottle is to create a simple and controllable platform for craft beer enthusiasts to discover.
Back BeerBottle and become part of the crew! :)
 
Prototype
This is our product landing page. It was designed by a professional and coded by myself. A little taste of where we're heading. It's live over at https://www.beerbottle.io


BeerBottle is a monthly subscription. Each month we'll deliver varied sized packages of surprise craft beer straight to your door, hand-picked by us.
 
Every package will be securely dispatched within a BeerBottle branded box. It'll contain 8, 12 or 18 different craft beers. Each beer will be hand-picked by a member of our team.
 
We know quality matters so for your money we'll make sure to only dispatch the best materials and its contents.
 
To start with we'll only deliver to the UK completely FREE of charge. As our product grows we promise to look into a more global solution.
 

 

All great ideas need a little funding. In order to get a jump start on our launch and get the first month's subscriptions out into the world, we're going to need a little help.
 
Some of the things we still have to do in preparation for our launch are:

Rent a local premises to store stock and carry out packaging
Purchase a premises licence enabling us to sell beer
Purchasing labelling & shipping equipment
Promotions & advertising
Other production needs & supplies

 

First, let me thank all of you who are so very generous and amazing to help BeerBottle out by backing us! We have many different rewards for you all of you. But don't just take my word for it, check them out yourself!

</div></div>","Chi siamo
                                             Ciao a tutti, siamo Matteo e Pier. Siamo entrambi originari della Piana di Albenga, un meraviglioso territorio disegnato| tra il mare della Liguria e le Alpi, ricoperto da campi e serre coltivati e dagli inconfondibili profumi di fiori, ortaggi e soprattutto di erbe aromatiche.
La nostra piana è la patria del basilico, quello vero. Quello che finisce in tutti i prodotti di eccellenza che portano sull'etichetta l'inconfondibile marchietto giallo del ""Basilico Genovese DOP"". Come il pesto: una ricetta di straordinaria semplicità| che però porta con sé un'arte che ha conquistato tutto il mondo.Ecco come abbiamo cominciato...Quasi tre anni fa siamo partiti proprio da qui, siamo partiti da questo semplice concetto: unire il territorio e i suoi frutti con la genialità dei suoi abitanti per farne un'opera d'arte che conquisti il mondo. Abbiamo preparato un semplice infuso con le foglie fresche del basilico, lo abbiamo rinfrescato con il limone e addolcito con lo zucchero. Così è nato il Basilichito: il primo e unico soft drink del globo a base di basilico.Dopo molti sacrifici e infinite porte in faccia abbiamo trasformato quel semplice infuso in un prodotto vero e proprio e abbiamo cominciato a venderlo porta a porta, nei piccoli bar e nei locali della Liguria, nei mercatini, nelle feste di paese. Ci siamo improvvisati baristi e lo abbiamo miscelato nei cocktail, lo abbiamo trasformato in uno spritz e messo perfino nel risotto!Crediamo fortemente in questa idea perché stiamo parlando di qualcosa di veramente buono, semplice per tutti e per tutte le situazioni. Vogliamo realizzare dei prodotti sani, naturali e di grande qualità per promuovere il nostro meraviglioso territorio in tutto io mondo.
Perché abbiamo scelto il crowdfunding?
Perché la strada è ancora molto lunga, per ora siamo una piccola società, non abbiamo una struttura, i macchinari per la produzione, non abbiamo i capitali e nemmeno dipendenti. Facciamo tutto noi 2, dallo sviluppo dei prodotti alla vendita fino al marketing fai da te. Ma abbiamo le cose più importanti: passione, energia e soprattutto le idee. Ed è per questo che oggi siamo sbarcati su Indiegogo per chiedere il vostro aiuto. Quest'anno abbiamo sviluppato due nuovi progetti e ora siamo pronti per mettere in bottiglia SALVIA e TIMO. Come il Basilichito, anche queste sono bibite stupefacenti che creano, con i profumi della tradizione, un'esperienza mai provata prima. La salvia è accompagnata da una lieve nota di arancio mentre per il timo abbiamo scelto la personalità del pompelmo.Qui entrate in gioco voi perché abbiamo bisogno di tutto il vostro supporto. Dobbiamo stampare le etichette, acquistare le materie prime e gli imballaggi, ingaggiare i fornitori e imbottigliare. Non siamo autonomi, ma vogliamo diventarlo e per far questo dobbiamo per forza crescere. Oggi siamo vincolati a dei minimi di produzione molto alti che richiedono l'impiego di altrettante risorse economiche e molto spazio a disposizione per lungo tempo. Con il vostro aiuto invece potremmo non solo avere i fondi subito disponibili ma anche smaltire i prodotti nel giro pochissimi giorni |senza dover affrontare altissimi costi di affitto.



Tutti i nostri sostenitori saranno i primi sulla faccia della terra a ricevere le nostre nuove bibite e gli unici a pagarle fino al 60% in meno rispetto al futuro prezzo di vendita. Inoltre, cosa per noi molto importante e per cui vi saremo sempre grati, potreste essere le persone che un giorno avranno contribuito a realizzare un grande progetto e diventare i protagonisti di un sogno diventato realtà.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and thank you for checking out our campaign. </p>
<p>Big Poppa Creamery &amp; Ice Cream is Central Florida's newest artisan ice cream business. ""Big Poppa"" is Drew Freeman a born and raised Floridian who understands the critical role ice cream plays during our hot FL days and family night outs. An entrepreneur all his life, Drew has been preparing for the launch of Big Poppa and it is finally time.</p>
<p>This campaign is being run in order to make two critical purchases for the launch of the Big Poppa business. It is finally time to begin full production and to start making appearances at farmers markets and food truck nights all over Central FL.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>Ok, here is what we need and why we are reaching out to the community for assistance:</i></p>
<p>The most critical component we need is also the most expensive. Big Poppa Creamery plans on exclusively using the Emery Thompson brand batch freezer / production machinery. ET machines are built here in FL by American workers with American components. These are the best machines for ice cream production on the planet.</p>

We have the aim to not only bring the ""original"" Poutine to New Zealand but to also spice it up with different toppings and styles in order to offer variation to the hungry New Zealand market.
By backing Something Cheesy you are helping to bring this idea to life and helping to increase the variation of international cuisine in the street food market of New Zealand. 

What We Need & What You Get
In order to get Something Cheesy started and completely set up we require $25000 New Zealand Dollars.This will be spent on the following; 

A mobile food truck (including graphics).
Government and local permits and regulation certificates.
Initial start up supplies.
Initial marketing.

If our goal is not reached we will still be going ahead with the idea, however it would be in the form of a ""ghost kitchen"" with a delivery only concept ran through sources like Uber Eats.
Please see our perks for some great unique perks for backers!! 

The Impact YOU will have
By backing our business you would be;

Helping to create employment
Bringing a new food taste sensation to New Zealand 
Helping us realize the dream of owning our own business that we can make our passion!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Brittney LaGesse and almost a year ago I decided to take a chance and open a bulk refill store in Boulder, CO. I had limited funds, but for what I lacked in money, I tried to make up for with passion, ambition and flat out hard work. This last year has been a rollercoaster ride filled with excitement, anxiety and uncertainty, but the one true constant has been the overwhelming support and love from this community. I'm not usually one to ask for help, but here goes..</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to take this to the next level. Food packaging waste is one of the hardest things to avoid in our lives. For example, most stores who carry bulk food today still require that you put your goods in plastic bags. We think that's silly and we want to change it - but it won't be easy. </p>
<p>We're thinking beyond just bulk containers with dry food goods - of course we'll have that :) </p>
<p>We want to go further and start reshaping the way we think about food packaging, and in turn, influence the people and companies around us to do the same. </p>
<p>From the storage bins for the various dry goods, oils, etc., renovations to our space, and the scales and systems to make this a seamless and easy experience for every customer, the cost is quickly proving to be more than we can take on ourselves. Whatever you're able to give will be appreciated more than you could possibly know. We have a big goal, but it's a goal that will have an ongoing positive impact on this community and the environment. Oh, and check out the sweet perks for donating on the right ----&gt; </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547666761/u4vkvvlt6kytskbbg2sy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every bit counts. If everyone made a conscious effort to create a little less waste, collectively, we could take a huge step in the right direction. Unfortunately our current infrastructure makes this difficult. There aren't nearly enough bulk stores, especially those carrying food. We hope to enable a community, spread awareness and hopefully inspire others to follow in our footsteps.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Challenges</h3>
<p><u>Infrastructure</u></p>
<p>As a society, we're moving quickly in the wrong direction and the only way to drive change is to act. We want to challenge our current infrastructure by supporting businesses who consciously make an effort to provide their goods with less packaging. We will make every effort to carry products from these companies. And if they're local - even better! Consumers have the power. Let's use it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Education</u></p>
<p>The single greatest challenge we face is education. The benefit of buying in ""bulk"" for most people has traditionally been cost savings, and that's it. Saving money is great and we can all agree on that, but this is so much more than a pinching a few pennies here and there. This is about slowing the impact of our waste on this planet. This is about changing our collective mindset to think twice before buying that over-packaged food item. This is about evolving as a society and making a difference together. This only happens with education and this is a BIG part of our mission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's going to be a long road and one that is sure to come with its fair share of challenges. However, we're motivated, we're excited and we're determined to make it happen. </p>
<p>Stay tuned into our journey! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Rowena Riecker. I am an entrepreneur. I have 24 years of experience in business from helping small startups get funding and put in systems to making sure large corporates were accountable for their decisions. I am passionate about people, food, the environment, organic produce, zero waste and want to make a difference in my community.</p>
<p>Earth Mother Organics is currently trading in Durban, South Africa. The café currently serves a vegetarian and vegan menu with breakfasts, lunches, coffees, juices and smoothies among other healthy options. On hearing that the owner is hoping to relocate overseas, I jumped at the opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
<p>By funding in this project you will keep the current staff employed, continue feeding regular customers delicious and healthy vegetarian and vegan foods and drinks. You will also make it possible for this shop to springboard into selling and teaching zero waste, vegan and home made products and help me start my dream of changing the world.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I need at least $35,000 to buy the existing business with the stock,staff, current premises, suppliers and customers. To keep the business stocked up for the next 3 months, I'll need at least $14,000 to make it through the Christmas period and a quiet January. An extra $7,000 will be to start the refreshing process by installing bulk buying stands, getting zero waste products and setting up the initial workshops.</p>
<p>We have some mind-blowing perks available! Coffee for life! Meal vouchers, t-shirts, lunch for you and ten friends, children's parties, vegan cooking and zero waste workshops, and you even get to take over the shop for a weekend!</p>
<p>If we don't reach the entire goal, the funds will be proportioned 5:3 into buying into the business (possibly with the bank) and put towards running costs of the existing business.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This has been my favourite café for years. A place to rest and recharge at the various beautiful locations the shop has been in over the years. I really believe they have made a huge difference and I want to take over the legacy and build on its great values. How to put into your mouth. Support farmers. Imagine a place you can go to for a quick cappuccino and also grab your organic vegetables for the week. Luxurious in taste but minimalist and functional in design. Sustainably made, minimum plastic involved, waste produced is recycled responsibly or composted. Our contribution to reducing landfill waste, reducing the impact of climate change and putting love out into the universe.</p>
<p>I've been a part of the organic farmer/volunteer exchange called WWOOF in South Africa since 2012. I've adopted zero waste into my home, work and lifestyle but have struggled to find products. I want to make it easy for people to adapt. I have adopted a vegan lifestyle and learnt how to make so many products at home because I couldn't find them on the shelf. I have worked for an international company which taught us to continuously improve systems and processes (kaizen) as well as to reduce inefficiency and waste. I hope to bring my personal, business and volunteer experience into one place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving my goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Current customers may get frustrated by the stock shortages experiences and stop supporting the place.</li>
<li>Current suppliers may be nervous of changes and start finding other customers to sell to resulting in stock shortages or price increases.</li>
<li>The long standing staff members may leave taking knowledge and skills with them.</li>
</ul>
<p>My plan to solve these challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>I hope to manage current customers expectations by contacting them with a firm date of when they can expect stock. I will also put in place a delivery option to save their travel expenses if stock gets delayed.</li>
<li>The current owner has committed to handing over by being in the shop and introducing me to her supply chain as well as helping me to get to know the existing customers with their preferences. I will have an opportunity to work with the existing staff to build up a relationship with them and to learn their ways. The owner also has back up staff to enable her staff and herself to take breaks and holidays.</li>
<li>I am very creative, love growing and making things from scratch. I have high emotional intelligence and also the adaptability to come up with solutions.</li>
<li>I am very tech literate and have good knowledge of business cycles, finance, accounting and administration.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<li>African Parks took over the management of Zakouma in 2010. By then, the situation was dire. Poachers had killed nearly 4000 elephants for their ivory. The remaining elephants were so stressed that they had stopped breeding.</li>
<li>African Parks made it a priority to set up effective law enforcement. Within two years they managed to halt elephant poaching completely.</li>
<li>The presence of African Parks doesn't just help the wildlife. The communities living around the park are now safe from the threat of violent poachers and no longer live in fear.</li>
<li>African Parks has built schools and health centers and helped set up small enterprise so that the people living around their parks see that a thriving park is a path to a better future.</li>
</ul><p><b>AFRICAN PARKS: </b>Zakouma's inspiring success story is not unique. African Parks has stories like this from their other parks too.

Jamie Sparks's beautiful new book on her experiences and time in the canvas kitchen at Camp Nomade in Tchad's Zakouma National Park takes the reader on an evocative journey into the heart of Africa, its people, flavors and incredible wildlife.THE GOAL: Defending what's left of the natural world is no easy task – protecting the wilderness takes courage, and international NGO African Parks has made conservation their mission. This book shares that mission. $100,000 of the book’s profit will go to African Parks, and 25% of all profits will go to African Parks thereafter.Photo by Michael Lorentz Tchad: Cooking for Conservation will be a beautiful cookbook/coffee table book filled with spectacular images of Zakouma National Park donated by professional guides and conservationists. Interwoven between scenes from the bush and the daily happenings at camp is a gastronomic safari. As you turn the pages, you taste your way through a week at Camp Nomade.Example Recipe HOW IT ALL STARTED: Jamie was tasked with setting up Camp Nomade with a food experience equal to its wildlife experience. Hours were spent searching through dusty market stalls, attempting to explain to chef Abdoulaye in broken French the nuance of flavors in fine dining, and introducing the eager group of Tchadian staff to waiting tables and hosting. 
Monday's menu plan THE SPARK: Evenings were spent around the table with the park managers, who told stories of the passions and personalities of African Parks, the organization that rescued Zakouma's animals from poachers and helped raise the park out of decline.Inspired by her surroundings and the stories she heard, Jamie knew almost immediately that she needed to write a book about this place - this connection between food and community, between conservation and sense of place.Ms. Sparks will be sharing her recipes, created in Camp Nomade's canvas-tented kitchen in the middle of Zakouma's dry, dusty planes. Cooling melon in vanilla syrup for when temperatures reach 45° Celsius in the middle of the day, pizzas cooked straight on the coals, sweet sesame snaps found in the sticky hands of cheeky local children, and spiced falafel served to guests out in the bush.Sweets Section This book does a lot more than tell tales of safari: it's a book on the lighter side of Tchad, a place that is complex, enchanting, and quite unimaginable. ZAKOUMA: During her time at Camp Nomade in Zakouma, these are just a few of the things Jamie came to learn: 
African Parks took over the management of Zakouma in 2010. By then, the situation was dire. Poachers had killed nearly 4000 elephants for their ivory. The remaining elephants were so stressed that they had stopped breeding.
African Parks made it a priority to set up effective law enforcement. Within two years they managed to halt elephant poaching completely.
The presence of African Parks doesn't just help the wildlife. The communities living around the park are now safe from the threat of violent poachers and no longer live in fear.
African Parks has built schools and health centers and helped set up small enterprise so that the people living around their parks see that a thriving park is a path to a better future.
AFRICAN PARKS: Zakouma's inspiring success story is not unique. African Parks has stories like this from their other parks too. Currently African Parks manages 15 parks in nine countries, making up the largest and most ecologically diverse portfolio of parks in Africa under the protection of any single NGO.The money raised by Cooking for Conservation will help African Parks continue this amazing work in Zakouma and in every park under their care across the continent.People are quick to give money to support majestic elephants and big cats, but what about the snakes, beetles, rodents and bats? What about funding grassland, beehives or fisheries? African Parks protects ecosystems, rather than particular species. And the money raised through Cooking for Conservation will be used with their wisdom where it is needed most.ONGOING UPDATES: African Parks will provide regular updates on how the money donated is being utilized, which we will shared on the campaign page and on the Cooking for Conservation website, to let supporters know how their money is helping the cause.Sign up to our newsletter to get all of our updates.  SOPHY ROBERTS (foreword)""On my first morning on safari in Chad, I trip up in an elephant's footprint. It is January 15, and I'm the first guest at Camp Nomade, a new mobile safari camp in Zakouma National Park...We penetrate deeper into the bush, and I hear it for the first time: the trumpeting pitch, like the creak of the Earth's crust. In a small clearing emerges a phalanx of steel skins lined up like shields. Their wide ears face us – about 40 elephants in view, with many more implied in the rustle of feet... I feel the infinite possibilities of this place... I realise I have been completely seduced – by the optimism Zakouma represents...""Sophy Roberts, writing FT Weekend 31 january 2015.Sophy Roberts is an award-winning UK-based writer, who contributes regularly to the Financial Times, among other publications. Her stories focus on remote places, where travel meets conservation, with much of her time spent in Africa and Siberia. She visited Chad for the first time in 2015, a guest at Camp Nomade. Sophy has written the foreword for the Cooking for Conservation book.KATIE DE KLEE (editor)Katie de Klee has lived in South Africa for the last six and a half years, working as a journalist and editor. For over two years, she worked as editor in chief for Design Indaba, the largest creative platform on the African continent. Originally from England, she is passionate about travel and story telling, especially stories of how creativity can help overcome obstacles.MICHAEL LORENTZ (contributed scene photographs)Michael Lorentz is a prominent South African guide who believes that travel, conservation, and philanthropy is an increasingly important place and one that he feels he can play an active role in. He also cofounded and is acting CEO of Passage to Africa and he cofounded Safarious.com, a social networking site for safari-goers. Michael is a passionately talented photographer and when speaking to him about the book, without hesitation, he offered to hand over years of Zakouma photographs for the project. The beauty of the book is in large part thanks to his generosity.JEAN LABUSCHAGNE (contributed scene photographs)Jean Labuschagne is not only a dedicated conservationist, having grown up in national parks in South Africa, Malawi, and Tanzania, but she also has a keen eye for photography. Jean introduced Jamie to Tchad, African Parks, and Zakouma, where her parents acted as park manager and special projects manager. Through her captured images she manages to open your eyes to her world.Jamie Sparks took a nine month sabbatical from work in order to write, recipe test, photograph, and format this book into something both visually pleasing, informative and fun to cook with.

The coffee culture in my hometown of Vancouver, Canada lends itself well to being immersed in a neighborhood with high profile technology companies, plenty of makers and creatives, and of course, a well established startup culture.</p><p>My research and subsequent shopping adventures led me to conclude that there was not a single hand coffee grinder on the market that met my (admittedly high) expectations of consistent and precise grinds, beautiful aesthetics, and ease of use. My team subsequently performed more formal research and confirmed that my initial hunch was correct. Besides, hand grinders are typically slow and messy, while electric grinders sound crude and noisy. The last thing I want to do is crank for two minutes after I’ve gotten up on the wrong side of the bed!</p><p>I’m extremely excited to be putting my team’s creation out into the world and it begins with this campaign. My team is not new to product development for the consumer market or the food industry and our collective experience allowed us to achieve this vision in just over two years. I’m confident you will agree Hiku is what all coffee enthusiasts have been waiting for.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515658251/nwfrhdzqyqbythndzyct.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://altimuspro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515657899/thvefrfzjegebyidex1j.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p><p>Altimus is a product design agency that partners and collaborates with inventors, startups, creative professionals and corporations of all sizes to commercialize innovations and launch businesses and brands.

This means that although our burr is far larger than typical handheld grinders, it is not much heavier. Designed for PortabilityHiku forces no compromise when you need to make coffee on-the-go. Weighing less than two pounds and far smaller than a typical 16 oz insulated water bottle, Hiku can travel where electric and other grinders cannot. The machined handle detaches from Hiku while the lid remains in-place. Slip Hiku into your backpack or duffle and everything you love about fine coffee can be enjoyed anywhere.Kanso Coffee started with a vision to build the best coffee hardware in the industry. Unhappy with all current offerings on the market, we set out to improve what we consider to be the key failing of most hand grinders available today: the ratio of hand crank rotations per unit of grind output. With every other hand coffee grinder on the market, grinding is a lengthy process. But speed is nothing without quality.The burr is at the heart of every grinder and Hiku is no different. Our team started by engineering a revolutionary new burr set that is both significantly bigger and substantially more efficient at converting rotational motion into finely controlled coffee grinds at an astounding rate. Where all others have turned to factories in Switzerland, Italy or China to source an off-the-shelf burrset to build their grinders around, we went straight to the labs and tested the competition instead. We benchmarked, we measured and we analyzed. Unsatisfied at what we saw and experienced, we set off to design a new custom burr from scratch.Months later, and after countless prototypes, analysis and refinement, our burr was ready. But the journey had only started. This burr had to be housed in a manner that reflected our design objectives, and the enclosure needed to work in conjunction with the burr and the mechanism to be a complete solution. We are proud to say that we have achieved what we set out to accomplish. Along the way we filed three patents pending and the unique seven-fluted, Kanso designed and manufactured burr set is just one of a series of innovations. Note: these pictures are from prototype testing to illustrate the range of grind sizes possible with Hiku.We are a team of coffee obsessives and product designers. On a daily basis we commercialize ideas and product innovations that surprise and delight our clients and end users. With Hiku, we began with a simple idea, but that idea blossomed internally into a full fledged R&D project, and quite frankly, a labour of love. Employing our in-house team of talented engineers and product designers, we set off on a mission to develop a no-compromise device that we know all future owners will be proud to begin their day with.Hiku is a finely tuned instrument in the world of coffee hardware. We believe that our background as professional product designers, and our passion as coffee enthusiasts have been artfully combined to offer you the most desirable hand coffee grinder available. A Word from Our FounderHiku began as an idea in September 2016 to create the world’s best, most efficient burr — wrapped up in a hand coffee grinder that I couldn’t wait to use each and every morning. The coffee culture in my hometown of Vancouver, Canada lends itself well to being immersed in a neighborhood with high profile technology companies, plenty of makers and creatives, and of course, a well established startup culture.My research and subsequent shopping adventures led me to conclude that there was not a single hand coffee grinder on the market that met my (admittedly high) expectations of consistent and precise grinds, beautiful aesthetics, and ease of use. My team subsequently performed more formal research and confirmed that my initial hunch was correct. Besides, hand grinders are typically slow and messy, while electric grinders sound crude and noisy. The last thing I want to do is crank for two minutes after I’ve gotten up on the wrong side of the bed!I’m extremely excited to be putting my team’s creation out into the world and it begins with this campaign. My team is not new to product development for the consumer market or the food industry and our collective experience allowed us to achieve this vision in just over two years. I’m confident you will agree Hiku is what all coffee enthusiasts have been waiting for.Altimus is a product design agency that partners and collaborates with inventors, startups, creative professionals and corporations of all sizes to commercialize innovations and launch businesses and brands. Located in beautiful Vancouver, Canada, it offers an exclusive and unique portfolio of industrial design, product development and electronics engineering services — all under one roof. Altimus was involved in every aspect of design, prototyping and engineering for the Hiku project. Along the way, numerous innovations were created, resulting in three patents pending and a truly unique product that we are proud to introduce to the world in collaboration with Kanso Coffee.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Backstory of the Invention</h3>
<p>Our idea for a fun seasoning mix company was inspired by all those expensive unused seasonings sitting in pantries going expired. Seasoning mixes at the grocery store haven’t changed in decades! We wanted a meal helper we could recommend or pick up for an easy healthy delicious large one-pot hearty meal. Thinking of our own families, we wanted to create a way to reduce the confusion, waste, and disappointment of traditional cooking and give everyone a shortcut to the vibrant flavors we know and love. </p>

<p>Before starting Broth Bomb™, I owned and operated the top restaurant delivery service in Tampa Bay, only to be struck down with a physical disability and chronic gastric diseases. With limited resources and mobility, I found simple ways to enjoy familiar cuisines without sacrificing taste or convenience.  I've lived the food desert life (poverty), self-studied food sciences, nutrition sciences, and reversed several diseases. Nicknamed hot dog as a kid, we gave our child the middle-name Bean, because they saved my life.  So, it's even more fitting that we would go on to create a patent-pending seasoning mix for bean stews; a pop-culture catalyst for easy delicious recipes.  Now, with Broth Bomb™, everyone can become a bean stew expert.</p>

<h3>Stone Soup Story</h3>
<p>A traveler comes to a village. She unpacks a giant cooking pot. Then goes to a stream and fills the pot with water, drops a large stone in it, and places it over a fire. The villagers become curious and ask what they are doing. The traveler answers that they are making ""stone soup"", which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share, although it still needs a little bit of garnish, which they are missing, to improve the flavor. </p>
<p>The first villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few carrots and adds them to the pot. Another villager hands them a little bit of cabbage. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, the stone is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by everyone. </p>
<p>This old folk story highlights what we are trying to do at Broth Bomb™. Long before we perfected our recipes we cooked soups and stews with this sort of, whatever is on hand, strategy… and always cooking enough to share. Not every attempt came out great but they were always nourishing. Through these experiences we developed some amazing recipes. </p>
<p>Today's hungry travelers from this story are people living in poverty in food deserts that don't have access to fresh produce. We all chip in to help those in poverty but instead of a nutritious pot of food, due to their limited access, they end up with something much less healthy. Part of our mission is to show that with only canned foods found at corner stores, along with our product as the “stone soup” catalyst, that nutritious hearty stews are accessible to nearly every person. </p>
<p>We plan to offer our products at great discount to the small shops that are used by a large number of families suffering from this food desert phenomenon. This won't solve the problem of affordable access to fresh produce, we just hope to help make healthy meals more accessible to everyone.</p>

 We all know it feels good to be hydrated and that it’s good for us, but here are some details of how it benefits your body.  Humans are 70% water. A lack of consumption of water leads to the dehydration of our cells, which can contribute to lower cognitive function and ultimately diabetes, high cholesterol, and a rise in blood pressure.This is why it’s important that we do everything we can to get that precious H2O into our systems. 
 We know that some people find it quite boring... 
 However...Add sugar? Sugar can lead to weight gain as well as all kinds of other health problems. Isn't there a healthier option? What about sparkling water?
 What?Drinking sparkling water not only quenches your thirst, it also makes you less likely to drink sugary carbonated beverages. That’s because a lot of what people crave in a soda or other carbonated drink is actually the bubbly texture, not the sugar. Researchers have found that not only are people enjoying the carbonation revolution-but that giving your water a bit of texture, that extra kick, is increasing the amount of water that people take in.

On shelves, in homes, and ultimately as garbage that gets sent to landfills or ends up littering our forests and oceans. Despite recycling schemes being commonplace worldwide, less than half of all plastic bottles are actually recycled. Waste plastic is poisoning our land and air as it is dumped in landfills or burned, but the largely unseen victims of discarded plastic waste are in our oceans, where marine life is endangered by the rising volume of floating plastic. It’s up to us to decide the legacy we want to leave behind. Will we contribute to the growing landfills and the trash island in the Pacific Ocean (or anywhere else), or will we take the high road and choose conservation?  
 That’s probably not the best idea.
 Fizzing Bottle is not just a bottle; it’s an all-in-one on-the-go carbonation, hydration machine.
 Two lids, one super-compressed air chamber, total satisfaction.Pour, click, and fizz.The carbonation system is right in the bottle! With a handheld carbonation kit, you can truly take control of what goes into your body.Wherever you are, indoors or outdoors, on an adventure or relaxing at home, Fizzing Bottle fits your hand, in your bag, or even slides into the drinks holder on your bike. With such simplistic design and ease of use, it's hard to believe this bottle contains a state of the art carbonation system. It also opens at both ends to clean, refill, and dispense your beverage with no fuss. 
 
 STEP 1Insert a carbonation cartridge. STEP 2Twist, fizz, and enjoy.
 
 Medical Grade Stainless Steel #316Medical grade stainless steel is not only resistant to dents and leaks, it also doesn’t absorb flavor, so you can rest assured that the beverage you put in will be exactly what you taste, however long it’s in the bottle.
 Easy-Twist KnobPlug in the CO2, twist, and fizz. If you’re looking to get a quick fix, we’ve got you covered, and with no need to return to the kitchen and make more.
 Vacuum Insulated WallsMaintain beverage temperature and prevent moisture from getting where it shouldn’t be. No worries in the “staying dry” department.
 Two EndsPour, mix, and clean with ease. Thanks to the stainless steel, you can easily toss it into the dishwasher and save yourself some work. 
 
 People use more than 500 billion plastic bottles a year.Just one universal eight-gram CO2 cartridge can put the fizz in 2400ml of water. What’s more, each cartridge costs fifty cents, whereas that amount of bottled sparkling water will cost you eight bucks! With our unique fixed dosage design, the Fizzing Bottle pays for itself in no time.1 Cartridge = 4 Fizzes!Hydrate yourself, keep your wallet in check, and ultimately contribute your part to saving the world.You can pick your color, fit your flavor, and design it yourself to fit your taste. Your lifestyle has its own needs, and its own look. Make it as unique as you are. Add accessories and stickers. Your look, your choice.Whether it’s gone flat or just needs a kick, you can carbonate or re-carbonate your beverage to your liking. Just like the outside, you also pick what’s on the inside. Add flavors that get you moving and excite your taste buds.
 The Fizzing Bottle is the first product of its kind to offer you the fizzy satisfaction of beverages that would normally require a trip to the convenience store or the use of an at-home carbonation device.No large machines, no fuss, no extra costs or waste.
 
 
 Not into carbonated drinks? Well we have good news for you! With nitrogenous beverages, you can get that creamy satisfaction anytime. The Fizzing Bottle is also compatible with nitrogen cartridges, which fit the same 8g spot in the Fizzing Bottle, you can have creamy tea, nitro cold brew, juice or liquor anytime!  
 Dual-ended, easy cleaning, convenient. All the features of the Fizzing Bottle but the Fizz.

<p><strong>Francesco Camarri</strong>: the 21-year-old <strong>creator of WINETO </strong>was born and raised in the land that is known as the birthplace of one of the most well-known wines in the world: Brunello di Montalcino. A great wine passionate and an explorer of new tastes, always ready to discover new places, Francesco wishes to give more visibility to his project through the internet.</p>
<p>I am a young university student who has developed a strong, deep passion for the wine world. It all began with a rooted family tradition linked to wine production, and with a reflection on the values that the countryside has always been able to pass down to me from a young age. I have always admired with great enthusiasm those worn out hands, marked by effort, yet proud. Proud to be able to lift in front of their faces those wine glasses, as the outcome of love, dedication and sacrifice. I have seen wine glasses absorb such a wonderful light while exposed to the sun, and then be sipped with extreme caution and with the bliss of those who can share their joy with their loved ones.</p>

<p><strong>Ilenia Almerico, Editor of Wineto</strong>: Speaking and writing about yourself is difficult for everyone, as this means explaining in simple terms who we are and what we are going to do different. On the other hand, it is also true that trust between people is built from an understanding of who we are and not only of what we do or can do. My name is Ilenia Almerico, I am 23 years old and I am a university student. I love to travel, discovering and savouring every essence found every step along a journey. Admiring landscapes, embracing colours, smells, and feeling part of nature: these are my passions. This is what drew me to the world of wine. I decided to support Francesco in writing the texts for the Wineto site because I firmly believe that tasting and travelling are a match made in heaven... And so I turn to you: What better way than a simple click?</p>

Ilenia Almerico, Editor of Wineto: Speaking and writing about yourself is difficult for everyone, as this means explaining in simple terms who we are and what we are going to do different. On the other hand, it is also true that trust between people is built from an understanding of who we are and not only of what we do or can do. My name is Ilenia Almerico, I am 23 years old and I am a university student. I love to travel, discovering and savouring every essence found every step along a journey. Admiring landscapes, embracing colours, smells, and feeling part of nature: these are my passions. This is what drew me to the world of wine. I decided to support Francesco in writing the texts for the Wineto site because I firmly believe that tasting and travelling are a match made in heaven... And so I turn to you: What better way than a simple click?

<p>This project started 4 years ago as an idea said in passing and is now in production. The Indiegogo is being used as a way to accept orders while the tool is in production. The turnaround will be 4-6 months, with the initial tooling phase taking the longest. Once the initial tooling is complete, future runs will take less time and the cost will be cheaper. Overseas shipping has been figured out and drop shipping once stateside is lined up. The revenue that is generated will be put towards shipping and receiving, updates to infrastructure and future product development.</p>

Bri, one of our founders has been maintaining a 100 pound weight-loss for five years and we thrive off of helping others create and maintain a healthy lifestyle.We also recognize that everyone isn't blessed with the right to choose when or how they eat and drink. As a brand, we are committed to bringing water to families and children in developing countries. A portion of each Manna Nutrition purchase will be used to fund short and long-term clean water, sanitation, and hygiene solutions in areas of need.Our goal is to deliver materials to generate close to 1,000,000 liters of filtered drinking water to families and children in 2017. Thus far Manna supporters have funded over 50,000 liters of clean water with the first 32,000 sent to schools in Costa Rica this past May, and the remainder pledged to WATERisLIFE programs in Project Omo Valley, Ethiopia.Flavors + Nutrition...Cherry Almond Chocolate Chip is made with delicious cherries, organic almond butter, organic quinoa crisps, 100% raw cacao chocolate chips, and other whole food ingredients you can view in the nutritional panel below. It tastes like chewy trail mix. Yum.""Absolutely obsessed with these @mannanutrition bars right now. Great source of protein for a perfect snack on the go. I've been melting them in the microwave and they taste like brownie batter."" -@thepaleopeachCacao Cashew Brownie is made with organic cashew butter, raw cacao powder, maca root, dates, and a few other whole food ingredients you can check out below. So good.""Honestly the cacao cashew brownie... is the best nutrition bar I've ever had. Make sure to try these from @mannanutrition. Taste so good."" -@vegantake0verWe've done a lot of research and worked with a development specialist to bring nutrient dense bars that are rich in heart-healthy fats to our current and future customers. Here's why...""For more than half a century, the conventional wisdom among nutritionists and public health officials was that fat is dietary enemy number one – the leading cause of obesity and heart disease. It appears the wisdom was off. And not just off. Almost entirely backward. According to a new study from the National Institutes of Health, a diet that reduces carbohydrates in favor of fat – including the saturated fat in meat and butter – improves nearly every health measurement, from reducing our waistlines to keeping our arteries clear, more than the low-fat diets that have been recommended for generations. ""The medical establishment got it wrong,"" says cardiologist Dennis Goodman, director of Integrative Medicine at New York Medical Associates. ""The belief system didn't pan out."" It's not the conclusion you would expect given the NIH study's parameters."" - via Men's Journal.Cherry Almond Chocolate ChipCacao Cashew BrownieRisks and ChallengesHey you know how it is when you're in it!

<p>So many flavors, so many dishes to try, so little time. How many times do you eat out a week, a month or a year? What if there was a way to know what meals you would like more than others so every meal out or in (can’t live without delivery) would be great.</p>

<p>Too sweet, Too spicy, Not spicy enough? It doesn’t matter. Part of the menu item review process on PlateRate is adding an expert review where you can rate the full sensory experience and more: sweet/salty/savory/spicy/bitter/sour.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever watched a cooking show competition on TV you know how the food is displayed is part of the overall score.

<p>Also, it’s quite difficult to find out if a restaurant has specific menu items that meet those particular requirements. Sure, a “vegan-themed” restaurant will definitely have menu items that are OK for someone who follows vegan restrictions… but most other restaurants also offer cuisine that would suit a vegan lifestyle, and PlateRate makes it easier to find, so everyone can enjoy the plethora of dining options out there!  With the click of one button, anything you can’t eat will be hidden from you, and we will highlight what you can eat by default vs. what you can request to be prepared to meet your food preferences.</p>

<p>MMS is made of high-quality food grade Stainless Steel. It can be stored flat in a drawer or hung on a hook through the strainer slots. Give it a quick wipe when making different cocktails for friends. No need to put in the dishwasher, MMS likes good old soap and water. </p>

<p><i>The cutouts on the bottom of MMS indicate ounces to help you measure right in your mixing glass.</i></p>
<p>Cocktail crafting starts by following a recipe. Properly measuring ingredients is the first step to success. By using MMS for every cocktail you make you will have consistently accurate results. With MMS you can craft your cocktail exactly the way you like it.</p>

<p>Sure, thoroughly combining your ingredients is important but mixing does so much more. First, stirring with ice chills down your drink. Second, mixing with ice creates dilution, and thats a good thing. Drinks need a little dilution to round out and balance flavors.</p>

</div></div>","MMS is about crafting great cocktails at home. It combines measuring, mixing and straining into one simple tool. Make drinks exactly the way you like it. Learn how to make the classics. Explore new cocktails. Share your skills with your friends and family. Go on, have a drink.


MMS is made of high-quality food grade Stainless Steel. It can be stored flat in a drawer or hung on a hook through the strainer slots. Give it a quick wipe when making different cocktails for friends. No need to put in the dishwasher, MMS likes good old soap and water. 


Measure

The cutouts on the bottom of MMS indicate ounces to help you measure right in your mixing glass.
Cocktail crafting starts by following a recipe. Properly measuring ingredients is the first step to success. By using MMS for every cocktail you make you will have consistently accurate results. With MMS you can craft your cocktail exactly the way you like it.
MIX

MMS has a curved portion of the neck to facilitate easy mixing.
Sure, thoroughly combining your ingredients is important but mixing does so much more. First, stirring with ice chills down your drink. Second, mixing with ice creates dilution, and thats a good thing. Drinks need a little dilution to round out and balance flavors.
STRAIN

The strainer face of MMS fits perfectly inside a pint glass.
That ice you used has done its job. Now its time to park your drink into a nice glass, either one that is chilled or one with fresh ice. The strainer will hold back the ice and allow your perfectly crafted cocktail to flow into the serving glass.



Because you deserve a nice drink and you shouldn’t have to rely on a bartender. MMS is designed so you can have a great cocktail at home.
There is a personal satisfaction in doing things for yourself. When you make yourself, not only are you proud but your reward is a tasty cocktail.


Have you ever made yourself a cocktail after a long day of work? Feels good right? If you haven’t yet, you should. MMS is for the cocktail regular and novice.
If you are looking to start a home bar MMS is a great way to fill out your tool kit. MMS is great for parties and get togethers. You can craft a different drink for each guest, or better yet let them make one for themselves.

<div>The silicone is durable to withstand high heat or low cold, while also being able to stretch and mold to fit any standard fork. In developing the design we tested various spatulas, measured hundreds of forks, and found that most forks are within 1mm in size difference. We made the Forktula to fit directly in the middle, allowing the silicone to stretch for large forks, or grip on to smaller forks. The double holes in the Forktula allow it to not wobble or spin around on your fork, so you've got nothing but clean plates every time.</div>

<p>The Forktula is a conversation starter. “Have you heard of the world’s first fork accessory?” is the number one question we ask in our lives these days.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone!  My name is Kris Blessing and I'm an ambitious 31 year old from Washington DC.   I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland and have a passion for architecture, sustainability, and business.  I love my hometown, and I've watched it grow and evolve just as I have over the years.  From years of managerial and food service experience, I've come to love interacting with new people and giving them a place to relax and enjoy time with family and friends. There is so much culture in this thriving and vibrant city, and one thing I think everyone, from all walks of life, can connect over is a cold glass of beer.  Beer and wine is shared with friends after a long day at work, during your favorite team's playoff quest, or during a romantic evening out with that special someone.  The goal of the self-serve concept is to make the experience as exciting and stress-free as possible.  I want patrons to be able to taste and experience beers they've never tried before, from breweries across the country, without the expense or hassle of buying an entire glass of beer.  The PourMyBeer system is so unique because it allows customers to try as many beers as they want with little expense, and hone in on their favorite brew.  I don't think there is anything more satisfying than finding your favorite brew or wine to share with your friends. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are two possible places your money will go if you finance this campaign, and this will depend on whether I am able to purchase an existing bar or if I end up leasing retail space.  In the first scenario, almost all of the money raised will  go towards the purchase of the existing bar. Most bars being sold in the DC area cost anywhere between $95,000 and $500,000.   In the second scenario, the money will go towards monthly payments of the space, and the subsequent interior fit-out to transform the space into a new bar.  Leasing a space can cost anywhere between $3000 and $15,000 per month, depending on location.  Interior fit outs of a small space like a bar would cost about $50,000.</p>
<p>The self-serve system cost itself is fairly meager next to the start-up expenses and monthly payments.  The self-serve concept costs about $1000 per tap, so a little over $30,000 for 30 taps.  I have been in contact with investors to help me get the rest of the way towards my goal, but contributions here would be vitally important.  </p>
<p>There are significant perks associated with funding my idea:</p>
<p>1) If you contribute at least $500, your contribution will be considered a loan (assuming my bar opens).  Within a year of opening, I will return 100% of your money, and include 15% interest.  </p>
<p>- A $500 contribution would mean a return of $575</p>
<p>- A $1000 contribution would mean a return of $1200</p>
<p>- A $5,000 contribution would mean a return of $6,250</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) For contributions under $500, you will receive a beer voucher available to use at our bar when it opens. (Be sure to click on the appropriate perk when you contribute!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I have talked to multiple bars that have installed the PourMyBeer system, and they have stated that the self-serve concept has almost doubled their profits.  Weekday business has increased significantly, and overall business has drastically improved.  I think this concept would absolutely thrive in a big city like Washington D.C</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I do understand that there are risks to your contribution.  While I'm super excited and want to get this bar open as quickly as possible, I recognize that speed-bumps are part of the journey and that achieving a goal is not always as easy as it seems on paper. </p>
<p>Challenges include: Acquiring the necessary funding, acquiring a beer and wine license, and marketing this idea to breweries. However, I do believe in people and their power to have faith in a good concept.  I really think that when there's a quality idea on the table, people will put the time and money into making it a reality.  During my time as a manager in the coffee industry, I transformed a struggling retail store making just over $600,000 a year in gross profit into a $1.1 million a year enterprise.  When I'm dedicated to something, I don't let up.  I know that I am willing to put in the work to make this bar a reality.</p>

<p><strong>The Lil' Farm Home Garden Story</strong></p>
<p>The Lil' Farm Home Garden design started in 2016 to provide my mother an easy to use stand-up garden in her elder years. It needed to be lightweight and easy to assemble, compact to fit on her balcony and large enough to provide her with a good planting space but small enough to move  and setup in a small space. Her ability to kneel and weed is limited and I wanted to provide her with a product that would remove those barriers and provide her with her joy of gardening in an easy to use product. The final outcome took longer than I planned but much better than I ever thought possible at the beginning.</p>
<p>After her use of the garden I decided that it could be used by others who wish to have a compact, but easy to use home gardening solution. I tested the product at my Colorado home for 2 years to make the product withstand all types of weather. It has now been decided that the Lil' Farm Home Garden is ready for the world to use.</p>
<p>A successful campaign will allow me to produce and market Lil’ Farm Home Garden, providing people with an easy method to create a healthy food source.</p>

<h2><strong>Fresh, Wholesome and Healthy Food in your Home</strong></h2>
<p>As fresh food prices rise and the need for healthy food is increased the Lil' Farm Home Garden is an excellent solution for people that desire a low cost, easy and joyful method of acquiring their herbs, spices and vegetables. Access to affordable, healthy food is becoming an increasing problem,  as big-ag uses crazy chemical methods to make coloring and freshness an illusion.</p>
<p>Time, money and location are big hurdles to overcome in gardening. Lil' Farm Home Garden provides a compact product with large potential and a low operating cost, providing the urban gardener a fun and a productive hobby.</p>

<p><strong>Our bodies rust every day, you know?</strong></p>
<p>Our car will be maintained regularly, but our most precious body is often ignored!It has become the norm for Chinese people to make money with their bodies when they are young and to buy their lives when they are old.Why don't you take good care of yourself when you are young?Make money at the same time must take good care of the body, if you ignore it, it will slowly betray you... Pro, must remember!According to the survey, although the life expectancy of Chinese people has been extended, about half of the people over 65 years old in China have been taking a variety of drugs due to different diseases. Most of the elderly spend their days in the hospital intermittently.</p>
<p>However, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, many people&amp;apos;s suffering from diseases can be prevented through maintenance in middle age or controlled by nutrition adjustment now.</p>
<p>In the United States, there are more and more ""senior citizens"" who are in good physical and mental condition. They are always healthy and full of vitality. We can see them in tennis courts, adult education classes, gymnasiums, and sometimes even in professional places.Researchers have conducted research on these elderly people who have a good old age and found that the maintenance carried out as early as middle age is the cornerstone of their good health after old age!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It&amp;apos;s better to keep in good health in advance than to spend money on treatment</strong></p>
<p>When the ruddy complexion quietly fades away, the wrinkles of years climb up the woman&amp;apos;s face; when the energy is overdrawn for a long time, the pressure of career makes men unable to do what they want; when the heart and brain function is failing day by day, parents always have to face the threat of vascular sclerosisWe can&amp;apos;t help asking: what steals our health?</p>
<p>British scientists have pointed out: iron will rust, silver will turn black, in fact, the human body will rust.The aging process of human body is similar to that of cut apple, which is the result of oxidation.Many chronic diseases of human beings are caused by oxidative stress, that is, the human body is rusting every day. The ""rust"" produced is called ""free radical"" in medicine, which is the root of many diseases of human body.Environmental pollution, life pressure, radiation and other factors are ""oxidizing"" our bodies all the time, reducing human life expectancy.""Oxidation"" is the main culprit that deprives people of health in life, and it is an important factor that leads to human aging and health problems!Experiments show that animals with low oxidative metabolism rate and strong antioxidant capacity are not easy to get sick, stronger and have the longest life span.</p>
<p>With the increase of age, our self-healing ability becomes weaker, and the damage caused by free radicals is manifested, such as wrinkles, color spots, poor energy, organ aging, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, cataract, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer&amp;apos;s disease, arthritis, cancer, etc., which are considered to be related to free radicals.</p>
<p>With the improvement of living standards, the popularization of nutrition knowledge and the improvement of health care awareness, the harm of chronic diseases related to diet is not only valued by the state and society, but also aroused people&amp;apos;s general concern. The concept of ""prevention is more important than treatment"" has gradually replaced the habit of ""treating diseases only when they are sick"".</p>
<p>Our goal is not to turn back the clock, but to live the best quality of life at the age of 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and even 100!</p>

<p><strong>""Wolf peach"" in South America becomes a new favorite of European and American family maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Tomato, which is rich in nutrition and delicious, is known as the fruit delicacy and the ruby of green world.It is said that the hometown of tomato is in Peru and Mexico. It was originally a wild berry growing in the forest. It was originally called ""wolf peach"". The fruit is rich in nutrition and has a special flavor.According to records, in the 16th century, a Duke of England named orodala was traveling in South America. He liked tomatoes very much, so he brought them back to England as a gift of love to his lover Queen Elizabeth to express his love.Since then, the names of ""love fruit"" and ""lover fruit"" have been widely spread.Europeans began to plant tomatoes in courtyards and gardens, and as a symbol of love and friendship gifts between men and women.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Time of the United States selects the food that contributes the most to human health</strong></p>
<p>American ""time"" magazine introduced many kinds of food which are beneficial to modern people&amp;apos;s health, among which tomato ranked the first.Tomato is rich in antioxidants, which can prevent the damage of free radicals to the skin. It has obvious effects of beauty, anti wrinkle, anti-aging, improving energy, protecting organs, and can greatly reduce the risk of cancer.</p>
<p>Tomato juice is very popular in European and American countries. It is said that Americans who pay attention to health care should drink two things when they wake up in the morning and before going to bed at night: one is milk, and the other is tomato juice.According to statistics, the per capita consumption of tomatoes in European and American countries is more than 30 times of that in China. In particular, 100% pure tomato juice has become an essential maintenance product for the whole family in European and American families.Drinking a glass of tomato juice every day brings obvious benefits to the maintenance oriented European and American people.The old people often drink it to delay aging, protect heart, brain, prostate and other important organs. The men often drink it with vigorous energy, while the women often drink it to beautify and beautify the skin, remove wrinkles and spots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>200g tomato juice, supplement the whole body nutrition</strong></p>
<p>At present, tomato has been proved to contain a variety of vitamins and nutrients, rich in vitamin C and a, folic acid, potassium these main nutrients.In particular, it contains lycopene, it really has the effect of love, can make girls more beautiful!We see that loving and scientific mothers tend to make their children eat more tomatoes.According to the nutritionist&amp;apos;s research and determination: each person eats 200 grams of tomato juice every day, which can protect the human health system and meet the human body&amp;apos;s needs for a variety of vitamins and minerals.</p>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li> Tomato juice is rich in vitamins, alkalis, cellulose and pectin, and is rich in lycopene. Lycopene is the strongest antioxidant, which can delay aging, beautifying beauty, improving energy and enhancing immunity. The higher the content of lycopene in human plasma, the lower the incidence rate of cancer and coronary heart disease.</li>
<li> Tomato juice contains a variety of organic acids. In addition to protecting vitamin C from damage, organic acids can also soften blood vessels, promote the absorption of calcium and iron, and help stomach juice digest fat and protein, which is beyond other vegetables and fruits;</li>
<li> Tomato juice also contains a kind of anti-cancer and anti-aging substance called glutathione. Studies have found that tomato juice can prevent some types of cancer, inhibit breast cancer, lung cancer, endometrial cancer, and also fight lung cancer and colon cancer;</li>
<li> Lycopene has the effect of diuresis and inhibiting the growth of bacteria. It is an excellent antioxidant and can remove free radicals in human body;</li>
<li> Tomato juice also has the effect of beauty, appetite, protein digestion, reduce stomach distension.Its characteristics are between fruits and vegetables, rich in vitamin A and C. due to the protection of organic acids, vitamin C can not be destroyed in tomato cooking.</li>

<p><strong>Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant in nature</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1913Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant found in plants in nature, was first found in cooked tomatoes.Its antioxidant capacity is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.Science has proved that the free radicals in human body are the main culprits of human autoimmune system.Lycopene is more effective than other carotenoids and vitamin E in scavenging free radicals, and its rate constant of quenching singlet oxygen is 100 times that of vitamin E.It is of great significance to prevent skin aging, prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, prostate diseases, remove garbage in the body, enhance the human immune system and delay aging.It can effectively prevent and treat various diseases caused by aging and immune decline.Therefore, it is concerned by experts all over the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Drinking cooked tomato juice is the best way to supplement lycopene</strong></p>
<p>Lycopene is known as ""gold in plants"".At present, lycopene has been widely accepted in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.A cup of cooked tomato juice every day has become the living habit of high-quality families, and cooked tomato juice has become the top maintenance product for European and American families!</p>
<p>Lycopene widely exists in various organs and tissues of human body.It is mainly distributed in human blood, adrenal gland, liver, testis, prostate, breast, ovary, uterus, digestive tract and other organs, in which blood, adrenal gland, liver and testis contain more lycopene.Moreover, the content of lycopene in human body is related to human life span.Lycopene can also inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein and resist ultraviolet radiation.</p>
<p>The United States and Japan have produced lycopene as the main active ingredient of drugs, its main role is to reduce blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, high blood lipid, reduce the activity of cancer cells.Lycopene is used to prevent prostate cancer in the United States and France.Israel and Australia have products used to prevent ultraviolet burns, protect skin, strengthen skin and nourish beauty.</p>
<p>The human body can&amp;apos;t make lycopene, so it needs to take it from the diet. Eating a raw tomato can only absorb 0.05 mg of lycopene; only the tomato juice with proper ripening degree can greatly improve the absorption of lycopene through wall breaking technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The strongest antioxidant in the plant world</strong></p>
<p><strong>Delaying aging and enhancing immunity</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beautify and nourish the face, remove the rubbish in the body</strong></p>
<p><strong>Protect the prostate, protect the heart and brain</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Powerful tomato juice, you can&amp;apos;t expect the maintenance effect</strong></p>
<p>Tomato juice is rich in lycopene, which has a variety of maintenance functions. Many families in Europe and the United States take natural tomato juice for a long time. Many people at the age of 40 can have a 20-year-old body, and those at the age of 60 can have a 40-year-old body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Delaying aging and enhancing immunity</strong></p>
<p>The aging of human body is closely related to the lack of lycopene. At the age of 40, it is the best time to prevent the aging and physical diseases. The way is to supplement lycopene.One lycopene molecule in tomato juice can quench tens of thousands of free radicals, and its antioxidant capacity is 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.It can effectively eliminate free radicals in human body, maintain normal metabolism of cells and prevent aging.Lycopene is absorbed in the body through the digestive tract mucosa, enters the blood and lymph, distributes to the testis, adrenal gland, prostate, pancreas, breast, ovary, liver, lung, colon, skin and various mucosal tissues, promotes the secretion of hormones by glands, so as to keep the human body vigorous; eliminates the free radicals in these organs and tissues, protects them from injury, and enhances the immunity of the bodyPestilence makes people less likely to get sick.</p>

Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant in nature
 
1913Lycopene, the strongest antioxidant found in plants in nature, was first found in cooked tomatoes.Its antioxidant capacity is 3.2 times that of carotene, 100 times that of vitamin E and 1000 times that of vitamin C.Science has proved that the free radicals in human body are the main culprits of human autoimmune system.Lycopene is more effective than other carotenoids and vitamin E in scavenging free radicals, and its rate constant of quenching singlet oxygen is 100 times that of vitamin E.It is of great significance to prevent skin aging, prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, prostate diseases, remove garbage in the body, enhance the human immune system and delay aging.It can effectively prevent and treat various diseases caused by aging and immune decline.Therefore, it is concerned by experts all over the world.
 
Drinking cooked tomato juice is the best way to supplement lycopene
Lycopene is known as ""gold in plants"".At present, lycopene has been widely accepted in Europe, America, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.A cup of cooked tomato juice every day has become the living habit of high-quality families, and cooked tomato juice has become the top maintenance product for European and American families!
Lycopene widely exists in various organs and tissues of human body.It is mainly distributed in human blood, adrenal gland, liver, testis, prostate, breast, ovary, uterus, digestive tract and other organs, in which blood, adrenal gland, liver and testis contain more lycopene.Moreover, the content of lycopene in human body is related to human life span.Lycopene can also inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoprotein and resist ultraviolet radiation.
The United States and Japan have produced lycopene as the main active ingredient of drugs, its main role is to reduce blood pressure, treat high cholesterol, high blood lipid, reduce the activity of cancer cells.Lycopene is used to prevent prostate cancer in the United States and France.Israel and Australia have products used to prevent ultraviolet burns, protect skin, strengthen skin and nourish beauty.
The human body can&apos;t make lycopene, so it needs to take it from the diet. Eating a raw tomato can only absorb 0.05 mg of lycopene; only the tomato juice with proper ripening degree can greatly improve the absorption of lycopene through wall breaking technology.

Not just the shape, it's the most hygienic way to make the dense, slow melting ice.We love it, and You will love it, too. :)These products are the culmination of 3 years of ice maker construction and material research, extensive prototyping and testing, carefully honed designed philosophies, and many lifetimes of melting ices around the world. Enjoy 'em, and thank you for your support.Crowdfunding allows us to design without compromise and run a company that we are proud to work for. We owe our existence to our backers, who help us design the most thoughtful carry solutions on the planet. We imagine a world where for-profit companies treat their employees, partners, customers, and communities as peers, and where quality of output is not hindered by the need to squeeze out maximum profit. Your support helps us to realize that goal. Thank you, again.- The Jewel Ice Team",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>Chris Chickerneo, co-founder at CelloVia</li>
<li>Andre Hueston Mack, founder of Maison Noir Wines</li>
<li>Dr. Wilbur Keith, 30 years of business/investing experience &amp; partner at Juicy Wine Co.</li>
<li>Jason Lummen, founder of People's Cider Company</li>
<li>Genevieve Rogers, winery consultant</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello, I'm Anita, the creator of this spoon. Our dream team consists of three people: my husband Andrew - photo/video production, my son Demid - copyriter and me -behind the idea.  I got the idea of this product on aug 2016. I went to a coffee shop and saw how the worker was pouring sugar with a normal spoon and he spilled 1/3 of the sugar on the table and floor. Thereby loosing a lot of the product and loosing the company money. Imagine if it happens everyday in every store, many companies loose tons of money! So, I noticed that the same problem occurs in my own kitchen. I'm a mother of two and I know how important it is to not spill any liquids/spices/products. The Accurate Spoon was the perfect solution to that wish as well!  With the Accurate Spoon I save my own time and the time with my family. Also my kitchen is always clean now! The first prototype was created in November-December. The finale prototype was made in March. The final prototype was tested in April and May. Thank you for your interest and support!  Anita ♥ </p>

Ever since I was in the 7th grade I started to dream up of having a community spot where I could support local artists and other's well being by providing a safe space where they can feel seen, loved and comforted in a humble environment and nourished with nostalgic yet creative foods that happen to be sustainable! </p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">See What I See</span></h3>
<p>White paint, black trim, yellow details with a yellow and white awning. More planter baskets filled with plants for a colorful pop  and a welcoming, wholesome aesthetic. A place where you can run up for a quick cup of local coffee and one (or a dozen) of my famous ube wedding cookies or sit and enjoy a tea pot with some miso caramel apple bars or slice of thai tea milk cake on a hot day. Everything is cruelty free which includes ingredients sourced where workers are treated and paid fairly. Fresh croissants with traditional and not so traditional fillings (think kare kare or chocolate hazelnut filled croissants). Nothing made with palm oil, honey or any other animal derived ingredients. Everything made with Miyoko's butter so quality is not a worry; and since I don't plan to plaster ""vegan"" out there, unsuspecting guests can remain so until one day pleasantly surprised that their favorite treat can be just that <i>and</i>  just so happens to be vegan.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My ultimate goal through this campaign is to raise money so that I can buy a cart, install a deck oven (which would replace the soft serve machine), fund licensing, lease a spot either in NW or SE Portland, and obtain sustainable packaging through both deposit systems and sustainable packaging. Having my own cart enables me to create freely and give you more variations of fresh options.</p>
<p>Even if I were not to obtain the full amount for the cart I could still use the money to get started on wholesale! Whether I have enough to quit my second job so that I can focus soley on Honeybee or would have to continue saving, my back up plan is to get into a commercial kitchen and get setup with a farmers market and do wholesale in accordance to continuing special orders and building from there.</p>
<p><strong>All contributions help! </strong><i>Even a dollar</i> or a<i> share</i>! For those that are able to and are interested, there are incentives for money donations! If you'd like, check out the donation packages that I'm offering!</p>

<p>It’s been a nasty 2018 mid-term election season...and it’s not over yet.</p>

<p>Wielding the Trumptonian power of Twitter, Cruz made a downright bizarre statement: ""If Beto wins, BBQ will be illegal!"" (September 16, 2018) The claims went viral. Another political smear campaign had been launched.</p>
<p>Well, we’re tired of the lies and the low-blow tactics, Ted.</p>

Ardmore is located near the Oklahoma and Texas border. That's where the idea came that I should open a seafood restaurant like my friend and mentor Andrew. I began doing some some research on this kind of restaurant to see if there was anything like it in Ardmore and Oklahoma City. To my surprise there wasn't. With that said I started focusing more on Oklahoma City. I really believe that this business will thrive and be the beginning of something special. I'm going to bring the same concept Andrew has been using for his seafood restaurant and market, because it has proven to be a winning concept.

<p>Loxley Coffee started as an idea stemming from three brothers’ James, Joseph, and William McAdams from Fairmont, Minnesota's love for coffee. We realized there is so much more to be had than an average cup of coffee. Inside each bean, there is a special and unique flavor profile. When roasted properly the beans can release any combination of flavor and aromatic notes.  It is our dream to produce small batch coffee and provide those flavors to you. This not only means you'll get flavorful coffee but it will be roasted fresh every day, just for you. We'll do our best to source and select high-quality coffee and sell it for less while helping to provide a sustainable living for coffee growers and producers of the world. With green initiatives in mind, such as 100% recyclable bagging material, low emission roaster, solar power electricity generation for all utility needs at our shop and cafe, and composting of coffee grounds and chaff. Loxley will always provide high-quality coffee at affordable prices without cutting corners.</p>

<p>We have procured a shop in Fairmont that will be renovated to house a new high-efficiency low emission roaster. We are looking for funding to help us pay for our roaster and the process of converting our new building to food production standards. Any further funding will be used to help convert a section of our building into a cafe area to serve our local community. The more backers and support we receive the better the building, equipment, and the more fluid our start.</p>
<p>With your support, we plan to be more than just a coffee company. We plan to teach about coffee, the bean, the process, how to brew, and select quality equipment to assist in your brew.  We plan to give back to our community and help to create a sustainable future. We will have a strong presence in our community from events to sponsorships and Loxley Coffee will help companies that we support to be better involved in their communities as well. Our goal is to be carbon negative by 2022.</p>

The technology was originally invented for NASA astronauts to be used to help preserve their muscle tone and strength while in outer space. Since 1990, the EMS technology has been applied in the exercise industry and has become a new trend for professional athletes to boost workout performances. 

Real EMS Champion+ is the most powerful and complete home EMS device for core muscles. Champion+ features a unique technology that can send four different channels of electronic current (ranging from 20hz to 80hz) to the major parts of the front and back core muscles, helping optimize your exercise whether you’re seeking core muscle building, abs toning, workout performance-boosting, or weight loss. In addition, Special semi-permanent/sustainable pads made of 99.9% antibacterial silver yarn eliminates the need for things like gel sheets replacement.
 


 
Real EMS Champion+ ‘s output voltage is 50V which is extremely stronger than any other home EMS product out there. With the extremely powerful output, Champion+ assists core muscle building, boosting athletic performance, abs toning, and fat loss by providing intense and higher quality muscle stimulations on abs and back.

Nowadays, most of us work every day in an office that sits on uncomfortable office chairs for at least 8 hours. Furthermore, the chairs are not conducive to our productivity or back muscles, and it is not surprising that an office chair without sufficient support can cause great stress to the lower back.Statistics show that a sitting position without lumbar support increases IVD (Intervertebral Disc) pressure by almost 50% compared to sitting with lumbar support. If you have back pain and are unable to concentrate, this can have a negative impact on the quality of your work. Furthermore, sitting for long periods in an ordinary office chair leads to back pain - A serious problem affecting people's performance and personal life.Back pain is common among adults and fortunately, the use of ergonomic office chairs can prevent these problems. Not only is the ergonomic chair a great investment during this renewed period of interest in remote work, but it can also alleviate back pain to ensure a better working experience.                     Meet NEWTRAL, the world's FIRST ergonomic chair that offers lower back support for all sitting positions. Whether you want to sit causally, work, or relax, this innovative chair can tackle it all with our special design. NEWTRAL is a feature-rich chair that has been manufactured with the highest craftsmanship and meets all your needs.Poor posture? No problem! With the adaptive lower back support, NEWTRAL keeps you sitting up straight while working or relaxing to reduce pressure and back pain from sitting for a long period of time. Adjust the sitting position with 5 locking positions and experience a new way of sitting like you never had before.Did you know that simple tasks such as looking up at your computer monitor can cause muscle pain or headaches when you work in this position for a prolonged time? This can be quickly resolved with the dynamic fully adjustable headrest, which can be adjusted from the top and bottom at any angle and helps to reduce the strain on the neck and shoulders when you lean back in the chair.Equipped with 6-way adjustable armrests, you can adjust them to your preferred height and angle. Armrests protect your shoulders and back from undue strain. They also prevent elbow drooping to reduce fatigue on elbows, arms, shoulders, and spine.The advanced 4D mesh provides excellent ventilation so you can make the most of your relaxation. In humid regions such as the coastal area, the responsive webbing is denser, with just the right flexibility to support the unique shape of your back. NEWTRAL ergonomic chair allows air to flow in and keep you cool and dry, even in warm climates. Designed for maximum comfort, the footrest extension provides the perfect angle to rest during breaks. By reducing pressure on your legs, a footrest can prevent blood clots associated with deep vein thrombosis, relieve pressure on your lower back, reduce swelling and prevent varicose veins.Why put your health at risk every day when NEWTRAL can prevent back pain? The average office worker or student can sit at their desk for up to 8 hours a day. Sitting puts a lot of strain on the body and can lead to many serious health complications, including heart disease and diabetes. NEWTRAL ergonomic chairs are designed to allow you to sit comfortably for a long time at work. Our goal is to develop a product that increases your productivity and job satisfaction but also reduces the risk of musculoskeletal injuries such as back pain.

VX Pet Magic is a therapeutic PEMF device that drastically reduces health problems and helps in the treatment and rehabilitation of your pet.
 
What do professionals (vets) sayabout VX Pet Magic?


 - Dr. Amy Hanson, an associate veterinarian at Potwin Pet Clinic, Topeka, Kansas
- Lisa Gilmartin, VX Pet Magic early backer 


- DeAnne Racz, Certified Veterinary Technician
 


- Dr. Neil N Floyd, VX Pet Magic early backer 



 
— Elena Busharova,  the chief veterinarian in TechnoMed veterinary clinic, Saint-Petersburg, Russia.

 I love the machine for my own old cat with multifocal arthritis. He asks for his treatment daily. I think this machine is great for all cats where we have few other long term anti-inflammatory options. Every owner of an older cat should have one!

Breakthroughin Pain Relief for Your Pet
Safe and drug-free relief for chronic pain, inflammation, and injury using a non-surgical and non-invasive next generation PEMF technology



 

 




Why does your pet needVX Pet Magic?

Our pets are suffering from many ailments and pains just like us and they need our help!

VX Pet Magic helps with:

Other problems we face as pet owners:


   
What are the benefits ofVX Pet Magic?


Here are some of the features:


Direct treatment


Calming



Non invasive


Super safe



Easy to use


Compact & portable

 


How does VX Pet Magic work?

Just like PEMF, VX Pet Magic generates an electromagnetic field that has a regenerative effect on the cells of your pet’s body.

These are some of the advantages of the VX Pet Magic when applied to your pet:



Increases blood flow and circulation at the site of application




Accelerates cellular metabolism and growth of healthy cells




Reduces inflammation and boosts pet’s immune system



 


Why is VX Pet Magic better?

The most advanced PEMF technology!

    Patented technology, inspired bya 125-year-old Nikola Tesla invention!

 

Electromagnetic field increases the permeability of cell membranes, normalizes the energy state of the affected cells, accelerates cellular metabolism and accelerates the growth and division of healthy cells.



Has VX Pet Magic been validated?

Yes - with years of research behind it!

VX technology was originally designed as a portable PEMF device for professional athletes to help accelerate healing and reduce inflammation.

For close to three (3) years it was tested on human ailments and injuries, eventually leading to successful trials on pets.

We studied stem cell reparation and healing time of a wound on a dog and found up to 3X faster results with our targeted and focused approach! The left side is ""untreated"" and the right side is ""treated with VX Pet Magic""

Experiment shows how fast the ""scratch/wound"" heals through the regeneration of new cells. Control cells are not exposed to anything.
Effectiveness studies of VRTX Technologies (VX Pet Magic) device by example of scratch on a fetal calf blood serum HyClone.
The studies show an increase in cell proliferation by 270% and increase in the degree of wound healing by more than 42%. Greater efficiency in wound healing was achieved 24 hours after the start of exposure and was more than two and a half times higher than the control cells.

Size of wound

In general, this indicates an increased oxygen availability and acceleration of metabolic processes in cells. This result turned out to be better (1.5x) than results of using one of the most popular pharmaceutical products, Actovegin.
% of wound healed in 24 hours

Conclusion
Based on the results from the pharmaceutical product and VX Pet Magic electromagnetic device, it was concluded that the use of this VRTX Technologies device is acceptable for relief of pain from various etiologies, inflammations, tumors and stimulation of wound healing, as well as provide relief from nervous disorders, depressive conditions and restore cognitive functions.
Arthritis and Arthrosis
A study of the use of this VRTX Technologies device for relieving pain in shoulder and/or knee arthritis, inflammation caused by sprains, bruises and injuries, post-operative inflammation was carried out in 100 patients of different ages (from 6 to 62 years). The working parameters of VX Pet Magic were as follows: duration of session was 2 times per day for 15 minutes for 3-7 days.
Results of the study from using VRTX Technologies are shown in the table below:

Conclusion
It has been shown that the use of VRTX Technologies (VX Pet Magic) device during several days (depending on the duration and degree of disease, age of patient, etc.) relieves chronic pain in all recorded cases without the use of pharmacological products, significantly accelerates healing of bruises and wounds, and also helps to reduce inflammation.

After years of standing on tennis balls, rolling on frozen water bottles, and trying every foot and toe stretch under the sun, they knew they needed to create a better solution.</p>
<p>They wanted to create a product that would improve stretching to better target the muscles that were causing foot and heel pain.

Some of the earliest versions of our modern jump rope date back to Egypt in 1600 A.D.! Since then, jump roping has been the training method of choice for elite athletes seeking to improve balance, endurance, coordination and muscular response. But... Why has nobody improved such a practical and effective piece of equipment over the centuries? Fun Fitness For AllWell… we just did! The Earth 2.0 Jump Rope is a completely redesigned and reimaged version of the jump rope that you’ve known and loved. Optimized for accessibility, ease of use and enjoyment - this is the jump rope you’ve been looking for! Remember your childhood when physical activity felt like play? Velites brings the fun back to fitness with the Earth 2.0 Jump Rope. Maximum Calorie BurningNot only is jump roping one of the simplest activities, but it’s also, by far, one of the most effective and efficient ways to burn calories! Jump roping burns more calories than cycling or jogging – all without leaving the comfort of your home.   Albert Einstein once said: “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.” And the path to fitness is no different! In order to continue progressing toward the stronger, leaner you that you want to be, you need to mix things up! Muscle confusion is the name of the game, and we’ve designed the Earth 2.0 Jump Rope to make it easy. With three different cables to choose from and our unique fast switching system, you can go from crushing double unders to extreme muscle building at the drop of a hat.   * This image is a render to showcase how the product works. If this message does not appear under the photo you are looking at the actual product photographed. Achieve maximum speed and agility to conquer the elusive triple under with our 2.5 mm Speed Cable. It’s your best friend when you want to go fast and furious.  The perfect middle ground – our Standard 4 mm cable is the do-everything champion. Ideal for beginners, the added weight increases feedback and has the perfect speed for getting in the “swing” of jumping. For more advanced athletes looking to increase the difficulty level, the Standard Cable provides additional weight to make high-intensity workouts even more effective.   Want to go beast mode? Our 8 mm Monster Cable will bring the fire! A true heavy cable for developing muscle and pushing your body to the limits!     Heavy cable not hard enough? You haven’t seen anything yet! If you want to level up the weight, we added another option that allows you to tailor the Earth 2.0 Jump Rope to your goals – handle weights!  Increase the total weight up to 5X in seconds! Just swap the cable and add the weights.Take it from 200 grams up to 1 kg! Can your jump rope do that?    * This image is a render to showcase how the product works. If this message does not appear under the photo you are looking at the actual product photographed.Handle weights provide 9 different combinations to dial-in the perfect amount of resistance. Start with 50 grams and work up to 350 grams extra weight per handle! Can you “handle” it?       Tired of jump ropes that can’t take the punishment and fall apart within months? The Earth 2.0 Jump Rope is not your average plastic jump rope. We use rocket-grade aluminum and stainless steel to build our handles, weights, connectors and cable interiors. We’re so confident in our construction that we offer a 2-year guarantee for all handles and weights! * This image is a render to showcase how the product works. If this message does not appear under the photo you are looking at the actual product photographed.     Extra Durable PVC CoverWeak cables are a common flaw with jump ropes and often become the first part to wear out or fray. Worn cables reduce performance and put you at risk for injury. The Earth 2.0 Jump Rope cable is engineered for maximum durability with a flexible but wear-resistant PVC cover that has been field-tested to hold up against multiple surfaces.  * This image is a render to showcase how the product works.

If this message does not appear under the photo you are looking at the actual product photographed.   Our objective is your health and fitness. We are a team of engineers, athletes, designers and lovers of products for fitness enthusiasts.Real problems are our starting point. We observed that athletes were surrounded by products formulated with chemicals, products of bad quality or with a horrible design which couldn’t possibly make them feel healthier at the end of their training.Athletes are our inspiration. Our starting point is the box: we observe what athletes do and what they need to reach their objectives.Design Thinking is our tool. We design concepts and create prototypes until we find the best solution to help you achieve your goals.   Relentless testing. All our products have been tested in CrossFit boxes, gyms, competitions and tried out by world champions of different disciplines before launching them onto the market.Continuous learning is what defines us. We enjoy the process, not only the final outcome. We know it’s important not to be naive about what we can achieve and are willing to learn from our mistakes (we too make mistakes!) And, above all, we are never afraid to overcome new challenges!Quality is our priority. From day one, quality has been one of our main concerns. Velites is an ISO certified company to make sure that all the products you acquire conform to the highest quality standards right from the development and the production phases.Special thanks to our Investors and partners on the product design and launch process: Award winning product designers - Dhemen Design.  App and web design : bov design  Marketing Partners :    We have already plenty of experience sending products worldwide even during Covid-19 times we managed to do a very good job and have always remainded responsible for shipping with our partners.That is why we know a transparent shipping cost makes the difference.In an effort for you, the backers, we are just charging for shipping costs exactly the rates we get without counting any extra packaging nor preparation fees.

What you need to knowAfter a successful launch on Kickstarter and becoming the most funded project in history in the categories of brain and mental health, we’re incredibly excited to continue offering early access to Mendi here on Indiegogo. If you’re new to Mendi and short on time, here’s what you need to know:
Mendi is a cutting edge brain training product designed for home use. Neurofeedback training is used by athletes, executives, and astronauts to improve brain function and overall health. 
With the headset and app, Mendi training stimulates the brain with exercises that help you focus, relax, and more. Mendi is fun and easy to use for all ages. As little as 10 minutes, 2-3 times a week is enough to improve your mental fitness. 

Backed by the EU and developed with the support of researchers at Stockholm University, Mendi is designed and manufactured in Sweden. 
Whatever your motivation may be to try Mendi, we want to provide peace of mind as you strive to strengthen your brain. As such, we’re including a Money Back Guarantee for everyone.
 With Mendi, you can strive to strengthen your brain in a fun and easy way. Simply control a training game with your brain.Your brain learns from feedback. Through live visual feedback of what your brain is doing, you can learn to guide your brain activity - the method is called neurofeedback.  Mendi’s headset measures your brain activity through a unique combination of features, including blood flow and oxygenation in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC). Think of it as measuring energy consumption in your brain's control center.Your combined brain activity is then visualized in a training game -  a game you control using only your brain. Just relax and focus, and you will easily control the game.The PFC is the control center of your brain. Increasing blood flow, nutrients and oxygenation to this area strengthens it over time—which is what you learn to do with Mendi!   Links: NASA and U.S Special Forces

Giacomo receives a Mendi






—""My golf game continues to be better, and I have no other way to explain that than Mendi” — The Gadgeteer 
— ""Mendi is the brain workout you didn’t know you needed” — Explica 
— ""Keeping yourself in shape is important. Often overlooked, your brain can be trained just like you would a bicep. Mendi makes it possible, using lab-tested tech with a combo of brain-monitoring wearable and an app” — Uncrate 
— ""It's actually very relaxing and might help relieve some of the stress you're feeling during the COVID-19 health crisis"" — Techwalla 
—“In the meantime, I did my own little non-scientific experiment to test the effectiveness. Each day I would first play the game without focusing on the little ball. Then I would play the game again, and try to focus on the ball as much as I could. The second instance resulted in a higher score every single time, in some instances a much higher score. Having tried this experiment 7 or 8 times, in my experience the tech works as advertised” — Gadgets & Wearables
 




Mendi is a professional brain training product designed for home use.Traditionally, brain training is considered expensive, with people paying up to $15,000 or more for clinical neurofeedback, in their quest to improve health and performance. With Mendi you can perform unlimited neurofeedback training for a fraction of the price.

While it’s possible to make some improvements to your brain by training your mind, Mendi lets you train your brain directly.    As we push ourselves to always achieve more, the limiting factor is not our physical capacity but rather our mental fitness. Our ability to focus, create, process and remember depends on our brain. That’s why CEOS, artists, athletes, and NASA astronauts use techniques like brain training to improve their cognitive function and overall health.Here is what you need to know about Mendi and other products:   
   Your brain consists of networks. It creates pathways automatically, helping you function without the need to make decisions every second. These pathways become your brain's habits. Unfortunately, your brain will also naturally develop negative pathways.These negative pathways can show up as troubling symptoms or even diagnoses. Examples of these can be the brain triggering stress or anxiety in a non-threatening situation or easily losing focus on tasks. For some people these negative pathways may not be so noticeable yet.this is an animated image, please allow time to loadThese negative pathways will often increase if they are not addressed, leading to poor mental or physical health. Just like the muscles in your body, you can train your brain to be stronger. When you train your brain, you learn to stimulate the flow of essential nutrients to the areas of the brain that need it most.Through neuroplasticity, you can naturally train your brain. By training, you can create new pathways that allow the brain to adapt to changing requirements in your daily life.The Mendi headset uses advanced fNIRS technology to monitor activity in your brain. The app provides training exercises, requiring focus and calm to control the game, subsequently increasing activity in your prefrontal cortex, which controls your brain’s pathways.    Here’s a peak at why experts are obsessed with Neurofeedback Brain Enhancement Training: Mendi is used by elite-athletes and sports teams around the world. University of Cincinnati Sports Performance uses Mendi. Employees at companies such as Spotify, Google and WeWork are training with Mendi.  Employees at WeWork and their tenants using Mendi.Schools in the U.S. and Sweden are already using Mendi with students ranging from kindergarten to high school.Mendi is used in Kids World Academy within Granite School District in Salt Lake City.In January 2020 we opened the Brain Gym in a shopping mall in central Stockholm. Backed by the property owner, visitors can try Mendi with the headset and app. The training is free and everyone is welcome!People training their brains at Mendi's brain gym. A throwback to when it all started…      Mendi is designed and manufactured in Sweden. We selected each of our suppliers with an emphasis on detail and delivery.

 Professional athlete and human rights activist Linnea Claeson blowing us away with an incredible control.Looking for ways to improve their own mental fitness, Mendi founders Sammy and Rickard discovered the challenges to accessing neurofeedback technology and training. After getting heavily involved with neurofeedback clinics, they saw the lives of many people improve with this form of training and decided to use their engineering backgrounds to create Mendi.“We’re driven by the technology and research available today to make brain-changing experiences available to everyone. As the science continues to advance and we learn from our customers, we are dedicated to continuously improving Mendi and the benefits it can provide our users.” 
 
And with a growing team, we are chasing a shared goal to build the world’s most powerful brain training product for everyday use. We know the impact improved mental fitness can have on our daily lives and long term health, and we believe that access to the best form of training should be available to everyone.
 


We’re launching Mendi on Indiegogo to bring together a community of people who are passionate about our mission. We want to build the future of Mendi with you!
As a token of appreciation, we’re offering discounts and early access before Mendi hits retailers.

In the worst cases, patients can stop breathing almost 30 times in just 1 hour.  After detecting snoring or sleep apnea, Snore Circle will apply the unique EMA+TENS physical intervention technology to automatically release micro impulse intervention at 30 different levels from weak to strong depending on the users’ condition, your oxygen will recover to normal level. This will tighten the muscles around the throat and open up an airway to make you breathe smoothly and quietly, and You remain blissfully unaware of this while you sleep better thanks to Snore Circle. After detecting hypopnea or sleep apnea, Snore Circle will release micro impulses to stimulate the muscles around the throat. The stimulated muscles will tighten to open up the airway, and then you can return to smooth breathing. Snore Circle conducts professional sleep data monitoring and analysis with the PDX Sleep Lab Polysomnography (PSG) device.  Equipped with a high-precision sensor and patented intelligent algorithm, Snore Circle accurately monitors your breathing to detect snoring and sleep apnea.  When those conditions occur, the device will emit a small, harmless electrical current to stimulate the nerves under the chin. This impulse triggers the tongue to move forward which stops snoring and sleep apnea and keeps breathing smooth and quiet. This intelligent system of gentle impulses works automatically and won’t wake you up, so you sleep deeper and more peacefully.This will tighten the muscles around the throat and open up an airway to make you breathe smoothly and quietly, and You remain blissfully unaware of this while you sleep better thanks to Snore Circle. Snore Circle can detect different kinds of snoring, analyze it, and then apply one of 48 types of Anti-snoring Intervention Models. Using an intelligent self-adaptive intervention algorithm, it provides an accurate model of intervention quickly to fit your sleep cycle without waking you up at night. You will breathe smoothly all night!   Up to 30 different intensity levels are available for different levels of snoring. By using just the right amount of stimulation on your throat muscles without disturbing your sleep, you wake up feeling better rested and with more energy to make it through the day！   Say goodbye to sleep apnea and snoring, the sleep-disrupting condition that keeps your partner awake and leaves you exhausted the next day. Snore Circle solves loud snoring and obstructive apnea by safely stimulating the muscles under the chin using EMA+TENS technology for fast, effective relief. Enjoy deep, quiet sleep and wake up refreshed and energetic!   Get essential insights into your sleep experience with the Sleeplus App. It records all sleeping activities, monitors the amount of times that you sleep apnea and snore, assesses the intensity  and records the data for analysis that helps you better understand your condition and track improvements over time.  Treatments for snoring or OSAHS are supposed to provide relief - not create more irritation! That’s why we designed the new generation Snore Circle with your comfort in mind. It’s ultra-compact and lightweight, with a feather-like 23g including the strip and the charging case. Whether you’re at home, taking a break at work, or when traveling, it is easy to take with you wherever you go!  Uses a medical-grade conductive strip that is made of flexible, skin-friendly, hypoallergenic cloth that won’t irritate the skin. It moves along with your throat muscles for a secure hold. Simply apply the self-adhesive conductive strip under the chin before sleeping, turn on the TENS unit, and relax into a smooth and peaceful therapy session! Disposable and compostable conductive strip, safe and hygienic for daily use. No more germs and odors from equipment, wake up refreshed with a good mood.​* If you need more conductive stripes after campaign ends, please visit our official website or contact  service@vvfly.cn to purchase.Just place the Snore Circle on the magnetic charging base after sleep and it will charge automatically. The magical Magnetic Charging takes only 2 hours to fully charge and provides enough power for at least one whole night. In fact, most snoring and OSAHS users can use it for about 2 nights. Small but powerful!                    ​",59.0,0,"5 Campaigns

Do you know what s killing planet earth? PLASTIC. </h1><ul>
<li>by NOT making Foldeat another box containing boxes we've kept the use of plastic to a minimum.</li>
<li>all the exterior parts that don't get in touch with the food are made from recycled plastic.</li>

</ul><p> </p><h1>The containers are made out of Tritan.</h1><ul>
<li>Tritan is a BPA-free plastic — it is not manufactured with bisphenol A (BPA) or other bisphenol compounds, such as bisphenol S (BPS).</li>
<li>Tritan is impact-resistant — products can be used without fear of shattering.</li>
<li>Tritan is tough — extending the useful life of water bottles and food containers, potentially reducing waste.</li>
<li>Tritan has exceptional dishwasher durability — encouraging proper sanitation for greater plastic container safety.</li>
<li>Tritan is much lighter than glass — making it easier to handle without the fear of breaking.</li>

Testing of the way it closes, until we've found a mechanism that is simple to use and takes advantage of every part. 
Prototyping the containers to have just the right size of a proper meal. 
Creating features that would benefit the user not by adding extra parts but by optimizing what it already had.
FoldEat will keep you in the permanent spotlight because: 
In design, a line has to connect correctly with every other line, or it just doesn't look right. FoldEat looks quite right. 
This lunchbox, every way you look at it, not one bit of it, screaming, ""Please like me."" It' s just a beautiful, complete, mature shape.
We've worked for months developing the unique system it opens and closes. Paid attention to every detail and made a set of containers that complement it.
just a glimpse of all the prototyping we've done to create FoldEatEvery part is custom made for FoldEat, a lunchbox in a class of its own.We've done our homework. As soon as FoldEat reaches its funding, we will start preparing production, even if the campaign is still live. We've been in contact with a great factory in the EU that will produce FoldEat according to our high standards. Because it's made in EU, there won't be any additional taxes for EU backers, and US backers won't be charged any China import fees.We have 4 stages we have to deal with, and 4 different suppliers.
1. Production of molds for the plastic parts and injection. We've signed with an excellent factory that can meet our standards both in delivery times and quality. They will also source the materials and provide all the certifications. Making the molds and the plastic parts are the hardest and longest stage, and this is where we started. This stage has begun as soon as we've reached our funding goal.
2. Production of the mat - we've been in negotiations with three factories, and we're waiting for the final samples, production is expected to start in January - we will work with the company that delivers the best quality. Assembly of the accessories and packing will happen at this location.
3. The design of the packaging and production of all the boxes will be done in February/ March. These will be shipped to the factory that makes the mat for final assembly, 
4. Arrangements for the shipping & delivery of the goods. We will work with a well-known company that can deliver fast.
 Speaking THROUGH OUR PRODUCTS, we channel our vision and what we stand for into our designs. The way they look, the way they feel, the way they work - our vision is a sum of all its parts.Making this product was a dream we had for years as we often struggle with the hard work of eating healthy and most of the options out there are not practical or just plain ugly,Our story is about doing, moving forward, pushing the limits and creating something we would be proud of, gradually over time on our own unique path. Extremely grateful for this life-changing opportunity Kickstarter and you, the backers, have given us- we will work relentlessly do deliver on all our promises.The FoldEat Team Let's talk about materials. Do you know what s killing planet earth? PLASTIC. 
by NOT making Foldeat another box containing boxes we've kept the use of plastic to a minimum.
all the exterior parts that don't get in touch with the food are made from recycled plastic.
because FoldEat's containers are made out of Tritan they will last longer in time - so you'll also keep the use of plastic to a minimum while saving money.
 The containers are made out of Tritan.
Tritan is a BPA-free plastic — it is not manufactured with bisphenol A (BPA) or other bisphenol compounds, such as bisphenol S (BPS).
Tritan is impact-resistant — products can be used without fear of shattering.
Tritan is tough — extending the useful life of water bottles and food containers, potentially reducing waste.
Tritan has exceptional dishwasher durability — encouraging proper sanitation for greater plastic container safety.
Tritan is much lighter than glass — making it easier to handle without the fear of breaking.
Tritan has no estrogenic or androgenic activity — see the FAQs page to learn more.
Tritan is GREENGUARD Indoor Air Quality Certified®.1 In addition, Eastman is a Responsible Care® company and is committed to using creativity and technical expertise to provide sustainable solutions. 2
