<p>When someone is being bullied, we want them to have an inner monologue of ""F-U  I'm amazing ... I don't need your approval."" By doing so, they can reclaim their power and rise above the fear that can prevent them from being the diverse, confident, and beautiful individuals they were meant to be.</p>

<p>Bullying doesn't discriminate. It effects people of all ages, genders, sizes, races, religions, sexual orientations, and so much more. Studies have shown that the long term effects of being bullied can be devastating, often times leading to severe depression and even suicide. One solution, according to Dr. Jaana Juvonen at UCLA, is to have at least one friend to confide in and to help alleviate everyday stress.</p>

<p>Since 2006 I've been taking portraits of friends, strangers, musicians, painters, shooters, dancers, rebels, actors, farmers, beekeepers - and anyone else that caught my attention.  There was a story to be had in every face, and the friendships made with a camera have become more valuable to me than the pictures themselves.   <br/><br/>After 7 years I've decided to make a book called, <strong>""I Need To See You""</strong>. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The children of Haiti have almost no tools to take part in the modern world. I have a program that helps them take a first step, and we do it with cameras.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your help to provide critical training and empower 50 of my photography students ages 10-18 during a 10-day Photo Camp this July in Jacmel, Haiti, called Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto. Jouk Li Jou is a Haitian saying that means<em> working hard to see a better life, </em>and<em> we'll keep fighting to the end.</em></p>
<p>I am Jennifer Cheek Pantaléon, a photographer, and executive director and co-founder along with my Haitian husband of Zanmi Lakay, a nonprofit working in Haiti supporting children through education, outreach, and community arts programs. We have been teaching Photography Workshops to street children in Haiti for 15 years.</p>
<p>I will be leading the second annual Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto/Youth Photo Camp where children from Cité Soleil and Jacmel work together learning vital skills to help them shape their future. This project furnishes the resources for them to photograph local daily assignments, and then edit and process their digital images with the help of a volunteer team of professional photojournalists. Our base camp for Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto will be the headquarters of one of our partners, Art Creation Foundation for Children, in Jacmel, a poor yet beautiful historical seaside town known for its artisans. The images will be printed and hung for an exhibition at the Fosaj Gallery, and the month long show will open with a public reception Friday July 27, 2012, where dancers, drummers, Kanaval devils, artists, subjects, students, family and friends come together to celebrate their community and the student's work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Support</h3>
<p>Your funding will go toward sponsoring children from Cité Soleil, one of Haiti's most impoverished shantytowns located in Port-au-Prince, to attend the Jacmel Photo Camp, transportation with local drivers, lodging and food for the kids and team, photography and computer equipment and supplies, and production of the exhibition opening reception including performances by local artists and dancers.</p>
<p>These students are photo ambassadors learning how to share and inform people about Haiti from a Haitian point of view. With the simple addition of a camera, and the technical training, children become more a part of their own society to make it better. </p>
<p>Your support will have a positive and direct impact improving and uplifting the lives of poor children, as well as empowering them to promote progress within their own community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At last year's first Photo Camp, 43 students made over 12,100 digital images in three days (<a href=""http://www.zanmilakayblog.org/jouk-li-jou-kan-foto-2011-project-overview-and-exhibition-slideshow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.zanmilakayblog.org/jouk-li-jou-kan-foto-2011-project-overview-and-exhibition-slideshow/</a>). They shot multiple assignments, collected caption information, and had one on one editing sessions with a professional photographer. Every student had at least one large print in the main exhibition collection of 70, and an additional 216 images were chosen from extra daily assignments to create four collages. The mayor of Jacmel, the US ambassador to Haiti, photo subjects, and others visited the exhibit. </p>
<p>The photographic and computer technical skills, group dynamics, and community involvement are accomplished because of resources we can provide and organize along with the experience of volunteer professionals - simple tools otherwise unattainable that can completely change the path of a child's life with new possibilities giving them more options for their future.</p>
<p>Haiti is often depicted as violent and dangerous in the foreign press. During the Photography Workshops held after the earthquake of January 2010, my students challenged themselves to take better photographs than the non-Haitian journalists as well as to reflect their country in a more honest way. In February 2010, some of their work was published on the New York Times Lens Blog (<a href=""http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/behind-33/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/behind-33/</a> ), and they were invited by galleries to have exhibitions in four cities throughout the United States. In return these street kids who are usually ignored built confidence, learned practical skills, their minds opened to new possibilities and options, and they produced beautiful photos shared in public spaces. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone has the extra funds to support our project, but it would help us so much if you would please share this link and information about Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto, Zanmi Lakay, and the kids in Haiti with your friends. We are also collecting working digital cameras for our students along with other items on our Wish List (<a href=""http://www.zanmilakayblog.org/zanmi-lakays-jouk-li-jou-kan-foto-2012-our-second-annual-photo-camp-for-haitian-youth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.zanmilakayblog.org/zanmi-lakays-jouk-li-jou-kan-foto-2012-our-second-annual-photo-camp-for-haitian-youth/</a>).</p>
<p>On behalf of 50 young budding Haitian photographers, my deepest thanks for your support!</p>

The children of Haiti have almost no tools to take part in the modern world. I have a program that helps them take a first step, and we do it with cameras.
I'm asking for your help to provide critical training and empower 50 of my photography students ages 10-18 during a 10-day Photo Camp this July in Jacmel, Haiti, called Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto. Jouk Li Jou is a Haitian saying that means working hard to see a better life, and we'll keep fighting to the end.
I am Jennifer Cheek Pantaléon, a photographer, and executive director and co-founder along with my Haitian husband of Zanmi Lakay, a nonprofit working in Haiti supporting children through education, outreach, and community arts programs. We have been teaching Photography Workshops to street children in Haiti for 15 years.
I will be leading the second annual Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto/Youth Photo Camp where children from Cité Soleil and Jacmel work together learning vital skills to help them shape their future. This project furnishes the resources for them to photograph local daily assignments, and then edit and process their digital images with the help of a volunteer team of professional photojournalists. Our base camp for Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto will be the headquarters of one of our partners, Art Creation Foundation for Children, in Jacmel, a poor yet beautiful historical seaside town known for its artisans. The images will be printed and hung for an exhibition at the Fosaj Gallery, and the month long show will open with a public reception Friday July 27, 2012, where dancers, drummers, Kanaval devils, artists, subjects, students, family and friends come together to celebrate their community and the student's work.


Why We Need Your Support
Your funding will go toward sponsoring children from Cité Soleil, one of Haiti's most impoverished shantytowns located in Port-au-Prince, to attend the Jacmel Photo Camp, transportation with local drivers, lodging and food for the kids and team, photography and computer equipment and supplies, and production of the exhibition opening reception including performances by local artists and dancers.
These students are photo ambassadors learning how to share and inform people about Haiti from a Haitian point of view. With the simple addition of a camera, and the technical training, children become more a part of their own society to make it better. 
Your support will have a positive and direct impact improving and uplifting the lives of poor children, as well as empowering them to promote progress within their own community.


The Impact
At last year's first Photo Camp, 43 students made over 12,100 digital images in three days (http://www.zanmilakayblog.org/jouk-li-jou-kan-foto-2011-project-overview-and-exhibition-slideshow/). They shot multiple assignments, collected caption information, and had one on one editing sessions with a professional photographer. Every student had at least one large print in the main exhibition collection of 70, and an additional 216 images were chosen from extra daily assignments to create four collages. The mayor of Jacmel, the US ambassador to Haiti, photo subjects, and others visited the exhibit. 
The photographic and computer technical skills, group dynamics, and community involvement are accomplished because of resources we can provide and organize along with the experience of volunteer professionals - simple tools otherwise unattainable that can completely change the path of a child's life with new possibilities giving them more options for their future.
Haiti is often depicted as violent and dangerous in the foreign press. During the Photography Workshops held after the earthquake of January 2010, my students challenged themselves to take better photographs than the non-Haitian journalists as well as to reflect their country in a more honest way. In February 2010, some of their work was published on the New York Times Lens Blog (http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/behind-33/ ), and they were invited by galleries to have exhibitions in four cities throughout the United States. In return these street kids who are usually ignored built confidence, learned practical skills, their minds opened to new possibilities and options, and they produced beautiful photos shared in public spaces. 


Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone has the extra funds to support our project, but it would help us so much if you would please share this link and information about Jouk Li Jou Kan Foto, Zanmi Lakay, and the kids in Haiti with your friends. We are also collecting working digital cameras for our students along with other items on our Wish List (http://www.zanmilakayblog.org/zanmi-lakays-jouk-li-jou-kan-foto-2012-our-second-annual-photo-camp-for-haitian-youth/).

<li>
<b>2nd Body - Canon 5D Markiii (approx. $2499)</b>. Currently my primary camera is a Canon 6D - it has performed perfectly, producing amazing photos. Having a second body is a NECESSITY, especially on a trip of this length and magnitude.

<b>Tamron 15-30mm f/2.8 wide angle zoom lens (approx. $1199)</b>. This lens is superbly built, very favorably reviewed, and much more affordable then the Canon equivalent. A wide-angle lens is a must for capturing amazing landscapes and dramatic action.</li> <li>
<b>Canon 600EX-RT Speedlight (approx. $499)</b>. I strive to shoot using natural light but every now and again a speedlight is an essential tool.

<li>
<b>Contingency equipment fund (remaining $1800)</b>. The remaining $1800 will be reserved as a contingency equipment fund to pay for field repair or additional equipment that I may need (i.e. additional lens,filters, lighting, or audio equipment).</li> </ul>

<h3>Why am I here?</h3>
<p>Everything starts out from a period of unexpected expenses. And just before my NYC travel, I've already booked!<br/><br/>How can I fix my economic situation and raise my moral?<br/>Let's try to sell some prints of my photographs!</p>
<p>I'm not a professional photographer and I've never earned a single euro from this passion. But now it's time to test if what I do is really appreciated by someone.</p>
<p>It's a new challenge for me! No matter how it will go,  it will be a great experience anyway!</p>
<p><b>Why Indiegogo</b>? I decided not to create an e-commerce and to opt for a crowd funding campaign because I felt it was more honest: I'm not a professional photographer and there are thousands of enthusiastic and professionals who are better than me. I do not have the presumption of making the sales of my prints a constant activity over time.</p>
<p><i>However, I think that my shots are quite good and I will be pleased to sell them in exchange </i><i>for</i><i> some help!</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I'm offering:</h3>
<p>In return for 30 € + shipping costs, you will receive the print of the photo you will choose.The print will be on 250g/m2  Fujifilm paper. It measures 40x60cm or 60x40cm.</p>
<p>The print will be signed and numbered. It will also have a short description of the subject or the location: when your guests will ask you info about your new wonderful print you will know how to answer them!</p>
<p>Do you live in Trento or in his surroundings? Make a 30€ donation instead of paying a specific perk and I will hand deliver the print. You will save your money!</p>
<p><strong>The costs that I have:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>il 5% to Indiegogo</li>
<li>il 3% +0,3€ to the payment system</li>
<li>6,5€ for the print</li>
<li>5€ for Italian shipping, 10€ for international shipping</li>
<li>around 18€ for me!</li>
</ul>
<p>I will also have a one shot expense of 25€ for the international wire transfer from Indiegogo to my bank account.</p>
<p><strong>I will begin to ship the orders starting from June the 20th 2017. Shipping will take around 10 days.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>I don't like your photos, but I still like you!</h3>
<p>Hey! Do not say that, I have feelings too! However, I will not force you to buy anything. You can still donate  5 € to help out. I will not judge you.<br/>Why you should donate without buying anything? Because although it probably doesn't look like, photographing is made by efforts, commitment, and perseverance. And photography can also be some kind of expensive.</p>
<p>Don't want to give me money? It's ok! You can always help me by spreading the word!</p>

</div></div>","Below you can find listed all the prints I'm selling!
Why am I here?
Everything starts out from a period of unexpected expenses. And just before my NYC travel, I've already booked!How can I fix my economic situation and raise my moral?Let's try to sell some prints of my photographs!
I'm not a professional photographer and I've never earned a single euro from this passion. But now it's time to test if what I do is really appreciated by someone.
It's a new challenge for me! No matter how it will go,  it will be a great experience anyway!
Why Indiegogo? I decided not to create an e-commerce and to opt for a crowd funding campaign because I felt it was more honest: I'm not a professional photographer and there are thousands of enthusiastic and professionals who are better than me. I do not have the presumption of making the sales of my prints a constant activity over time.
However, I think that my shots are quite good and I will be pleased to sell them in exchange for some help!

What I'm offering:
In return for 30 € + shipping costs, you will receive the print of the photo you will choose.The print will be on 250g/m2  Fujifilm paper. It measures 40x60cm or 60x40cm.
The print will be signed and numbered. It will also have a short description of the subject or the location: when your guests will ask you info about your new wonderful print you will know how to answer them!
Do you live in Trento or in his surroundings? Make a 30€ donation instead of paying a specific perk and I will hand deliver the print. You will save your money!
The costs that I have:

il 5% to Indiegogo
il 3% +0,3€ to the payment system
6,5€ for the print
5€ for Italian shipping, 10€ for international shipping
around 18€ for me!

I will also have a one shot expense of 25€ for the international wire transfer from Indiegogo to my bank account.
I will begin to ship the orders starting from June the 20th 2017. Shipping will take around 10 days.

I don't like your photos, but I still like you!
Hey! Do not say that, I have feelings too! However, I will not force you to buy anything. You can still donate  5 € to help out. I will not judge you.Why you should donate without buying anything? Because although it probably doesn't look like, photographing is made by efforts, commitment, and perseverance. And photography can also be some kind of expensive.
Don't want to give me money? It's ok! You can always help me by spreading the word!

<h3>Help me save my Arts District Photography Studio!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>A little about me:</em></strong></p>
<p>Hi, My name is Mallorie Nasrallah. The fancy phone in the video is not mine! ;)<br/>I am a photographer in Las Vegas, Nevada. And if I may take a moment to feel awesome, the <a href=""http://mallorienasrallah.blogspot.com/2012/11/rawards.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAW Las Vegas photographer of the year</a>! <br/>That makes me rich right?<br/>Nope, I am broke! Ive been making my living entirely off photography for 8 years now. I've got what I thought was a reasonable business plan, and I have slowly progressed as my work has gotten better, but living off your passion and your art is tough work, and often extremely expensive!<br/><br/>For 8 years now I have been releasing my work to the public, for whatever enjoyment people can get from it. The only time anyone pays a cent is if I am doing work specifically for them, or they want a physical print. <br/><br/>I try to be active in the community, with art donations, and other fun stuff. <br/>I provide video tutorials for free on my photography blog.</p>
<p><br/>If I could, I would shoot for free and give all my work away. For someone with a business plan, I really shouldn't think that way. But I love my work, and I love sharing it.</p>

<h3>Why I need help.</h3>
The owner (Kamran Foulad) of the property I rent is trying to evict me for either discriminatory or retaliatory (or both) reasons. <br/><br/>Let me explain, the owner of the property is attempting to illegally evict me!<br/>I pay rent on time, everyone in this area has been remarkably supportive, I really have done nothing wrong. <br/><br/>On March 27th I had a booking in the morning, I arrived at my studio early to set up.

<div> </div>
<div>The good news is they are admitting they have no cause to evict me. The funny news is that from my understanding of it a ""no cause"" can only be filed if the tenant is out of their lease.

<h3>How your contributions will be used:</h3>
<p>I am admittedly a starving artist. I know I need legal representation, but I simply lack the funds. <br/>I will use your funds to fight to stop these people doing this to others, and attempt to seek justice. I am not the first and I know not the last (just today a man was told to quit his job to manage the property, after he did this he was told he wasn't needed and he had 2 days to leave his apartment, I have invited him to join me in pursuing legal recourse).<br/><br/>I want to be able to keep making art, keep sharing it and continue to be a part of this community.

<p>While backpacking through Southeast Asia recently, I was fortunate enough to visit <a href=""http://www.copelaos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""COPE""><strong>COPE</strong></a>, a center in Vientiane, Laos dedicated to helping rebuild the lives, families and communities destroyed by unexploded ordnance (UXOs).  The amount of UXOs in Laos is unimaginable and the majority of UXOs are a result of wars that Laos wasn’t even a part of.  Most disturbing, <strong>50% of victims of UXOs in the post-conflict era are children</strong>.</p>
<p>I was very moved by what I saw at COPE and what they are doing for the victims.  You can read about my experience <a href=""http://www.storiesandscars.com/2011/04/cope.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""blog about COPE""><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>
<p><img alt=""boat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd100/kevinleea/IndiePhoto03b.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; border-width: 3px; border-color: black;""/>I want to use my IndieGoGo photography campaign to help raise money to further the efforts of COPE.</p>
<p>So, <strong>20% of all money raised through my campaign will go to COPE</strong>.</p>
<p>If the overall goal of $2500 is reached, COPE will receive $500.  I understand that may not sound like a lot of money.  However, $500 can buy 33 weeks of food for a victim…..or six prosthetic legs…..or three prosthetic arms…..or two treatments for club foot.</p>
<p><strong>A single prosthetic or treatment doesn’t just help the recipient.  It helps their family, their village, their community.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone who participates in the campaign will receive all updates regarding the money donated to COPE and the people we help.  Please, let’s do everything can to reach the goal and donate $500…or more…to COPE.</p>
<p>To learn more about COPE, there is a video posted in the gallery section or you can view their website <a href=""http://www.copelaos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""COPE""><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<h3><strong>ME</strong></h3>
<p>Hi.  I’m Kevin and I am an Austin based travel photographer and writer.  I capture and record moments from my trips around the world, from internationally known <img alt=""me"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd100/kevinleea/K4MP.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 10px;""/>landmarks (pyramids of Giza) to simple moments (a boat floating in a pond in Vietnam) to a relaxing milieu (surfers floating on their boards at sunset in Costa Rica). </p>
<p>In the beginning photography was just a curiosity and writing was a slight interest.  From a curiosity and interest to a passion to a dream.  That is where I am now.  It is one of my dreams to be able to explore the world and document it through my photography and writing.</p>
<p>Angles.  Colors.  Texture.  Light.  Perspective.  Emotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE GOAL</strong></h3>
<p>I am in the process of completing my photography website, <a href=""http://www.kevinarmstrongphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Armstrong Photography</a>, and travel blog, <a href=""http://www.storiesandscars.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stories &amp; Scars</a>. With your help, I know I can do that.</p>
<p>The foundations of both websites have been created.  My goal is to build on what I have started and ultimately generate a strong web presence.  Once that is achieved, I will be able to successfully update the online community about new trips, photos and promotions.  I have a great start on the websites thus far, but have a long way to go.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.  Participating.  Donating.  The Dough.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></h3>
<p>Some people just want to be a part of something creative.  I dig that.  Hopefully, you will find some satisfaction in being a part of something that is inspiring to you and also very important to me.</p>
<p><img alt=""Giza"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i226.photobucket.com/albums/dd100/kevinleea/IndiePhoto07b.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; border-width: 3px; border-color: black; margin: 10px;""/>But, the perks.  Free photo.  Discounts.</p>
<p>Take a look to the right of this page, pick a perk and click the button. In addition to enjoying the perks for yourself, you can share the discount code with your family and friends.  The discount codes for each perk level will be delivered via email upon completion of the campaign and will be valid until September 1st, 2012.  The photo of your choice will be ordered at a time of your choosing prior to September 1st, 2012.</p>
<p>One common question is if you have to register for IndieGoGo to donate or receive a perk.  You do not have to register with IndieGoGo to participate in this campaign.</p>

<p>Take a look at the white box below the video.  Everything you need to help send this campaign to every corner of the internet is right there.  Facebook.  Twitter.  Google+.  Embed.  Email.  And a URL to share my campaign.  The extra traffic and exposure you help create could get my campaign featured on IdieGoGo’s main page.  That would be huge!  It is all about getting this in front of as many eyes as possible and giving people the opportunity to be a part of it.</p>

<h3>THANK YOU</h3>
<p>Thanks for listening.  I hope this finds you well wherever you are.  And whatever you are doing, even if it isn’t your dream, I hope it’s at least one step closer to it.</p>
<p>Kevin</p></div>","THE CHARITY - COPE
While backpacking through Southeast Asia recently, I was fortunate enough to visit COPE, a center in Vientiane, Laos dedicated to helping rebuild the lives, families and communities destroyed by unexploded ordnance (UXOs).  The amount of UXOs in Laos is unimaginable and the majority of UXOs are a result of wars that Laos wasn’t even a part of.  Most disturbing, 50% of victims of UXOs in the post-conflict era are children.
I was very moved by what I saw at COPE and what they are doing for the victims.  You can read about my experience here. 
I want to use my IndieGoGo photography campaign to help raise money to further the efforts of COPE.
So, 20% of all money raised through my campaign will go to COPE.
If the overall goal of $2500 is reached, COPE will receive $500.  I understand that may not sound like a lot of money.  However, $500 can buy 33 weeks of food for a victim…..or six prosthetic legs…..or three prosthetic arms…..or two treatments for club foot.
A single prosthetic or treatment doesn’t just help the recipient.  It helps their family, their village, their community.
Everyone who participates in the campaign will receive all updates regarding the money donated to COPE and the people we help.  Please, let’s do everything can to reach the goal and donate $500…or more…to COPE.
To learn more about COPE, there is a video posted in the gallery section or you can view their website here.

Art can preserve a moment.  Art can redefine an experience.  Art can change perspective.  Art can create an emotion.  Art can bring a smile...hope...peace. 
 
ME
Hi.  I’m Kevin and I am an Austin based travel photographer and writer.  I capture and record moments from my trips around the world, from internationally known landmarks (pyramids of Giza) to simple moments (a boat floating in a pond in Vietnam) to a relaxing milieu (surfers floating on their boards at sunset in Costa Rica). 
In the beginning photography was just a curiosity and writing was a slight interest.  From a curiosity and interest to a passion to a dream.  That is where I am now.  It is one of my dreams to be able to explore the world and document it through my photography and writing.
Angles.  Colors.  Texture.  Light.  Perspective.  Emotion.
 
THE GOAL
I am in the process of completing my photography website, Kevin Armstrong Photography, and travel blog, Stories & Scars. With your help, I know I can do that.
The foundations of both websites have been created.  My goal is to build on what I have started and ultimately generate a strong web presence.  Once that is achieved, I will be able to successfully update the online community about new trips, photos and promotions.  I have a great start on the websites thus far, but have a long way to go.
This is where you come in.  Participating.  Donating.  The Dough.
 
WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU
Some people just want to be a part of something creative.  I dig that.  Hopefully, you will find some satisfaction in being a part of something that is inspiring to you and also very important to me.
But, the perks.  Free photo.  Discounts.
Take a look to the right of this page, pick a perk and click the button. In addition to enjoying the perks for yourself, you can share the discount code with your family and friends.  The discount codes for each perk level will be delivered via email upon completion of the campaign and will be valid until September 1st, 2012.  The photo of your choice will be ordered at a time of your choosing prior to September 1st, 2012.
One common question is if you have to register for IndieGoGo to donate or receive a perk.  You do not have to register with IndieGoGo to participate in this campaign.
 
WHAT’S THE DOUGH GONNA BE USED FOR
Based on how much of the budget ($2500) is reached, my hope is to use the money in four areas:

Adding photos
Updating portions of photography website
Completing the blog
Marketing
It may seem like it doesn’t take much time to put a photo on the web or update a blog.  However, each photo and blog entry offers a different level of complexity and time.  When working with hundreds of photos and a multitude of blog entries, it can take months.
One of the goals is to add photos from trips to Colombia, Costa Rica, Jordan, California and Texas.
Once the photos are added, portions of the website will be updated.  There is the potential for a new layout as well as the addition of music.
I hope to complete the travel blog while adding photos to the photography website.  The current blog topic is about a 6-week trip through Southeast Asia where I taught my parents how to backpack.  Here is one of my blogs titled MY POLITICAL CAREER IS DEAD.  It's about an uncomfortable massage in Laos with my parents in tow.  There are plenty more stories like it.
Upon completion, marketing will begin.  My hope is to build an email list to maintain direct communication with the online community as well as generate a big following on twitter (@kevinleea) and facebook (www.facebook.com/KevinArmstrongPhotography.)

An extremely important way to help is to spread the word about my campaign.  I understand not everyone can donate.  That’s cool.  Word of mouth is what makes these campaigns successful.  You may share this with someone who also passes it on, and that could turn into multiple donations.  I just need you to spread the word.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""The scenery is beautiful - wish you were here"" postcards from the past no longer paint an accurate picture of the reality of 99% of Americans. In 2018 we have an existential crisis with homelessness at an all time high and a lack of affordable housing.</p>
<p>Back in 2011 some folks started a movement in New York City called ""Occupy Wall Street"" against corporate corruption and rising inequality, receiving global attention and spawning a surge against economic inequality. Today in 2018 we feel the need to protest daily and we are reminded of what the original protest of the new Millennium stood for and foretold us would happen if nothing was done. Not enough was done and happening it is.</p>
<p>Photographer Carl Posey was on location in 2011 and his captures of the Occupy Wall Street Protest portray priceless historic documentation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518817835/ynyp9si2fiif1wuvruje.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's our duty to defend liberties and human rights and as artists we feel the responsibility to somehow reflect the present status of society in our work. Even if we are not protesting on the street, we cannot ignore reality. Carl's images convey a direct message or a particular feeling without words and they're prefect for the call to keeping the momentum going. We thought postcards were an easy and impactful way for everyone to share them via the good old method of snail mail. We plan to create lots and lots of postcards to be mailed.</p>

<h3>The Photographer</h3>
<p>For close to 3 decades Carl Posey has passionately put  spotlights on people to bring out their character. ""A mixture of patience and a form of manipulation is what eventually brings out the honest spirit in someone"", Carl says. His love for life and people is what makes it possible for him to do it over and over again and what makes the images feel free of any barriers between the subject and the photographer.</p>

<p>Throughout his long carrier, Carl Posey's work has been featured in countless magazines, museums, books as well as advertising.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm thrilled that Carl has agreed to make his intriguing images available to use for this activist project, because needless to say in order for a postcard to be bought and sent out, not to mention be looked at and cherished by the recipient, appeal and is key. Every single image we picked is striking on its own or in a set. In an increasingly digital world, imagine what it will mean to get one of these postcards in the mailbox. We think the impact will be unmeasurable and oh so necessary. Let's spread these images (messages) people. The more money we can raise the more postcards we will print to be mailed, so let's get going! Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>A Little Bit About Me &amp; The Project</h3>
<p>I'm an artist from Michigan and received my Bachelors of Fine Arts from the Maryland Institute College of Art. In 2010, when I graduated with my degree in photography I was lucky enough to have been awarded the Meyer's Travel Fellowship. The fellowship allowed me to travel to Tibet to photograph the Khampa Nomad's devotion to Gesar, an 11th Century enlightened warrior king, in their modernizing society.</p>
<p>Photographing and living with the Mira clan in their summer pasture was one of the most amazing experiences I've had. I fell in love with the landscape and made lasting friendships. </p>
<p>The project grew and evolved. While it was still about the Khampa's faith in Gesar, it also became a portrait of a family that had been torn apart by feuds and their transition back to normal family life.</p>
<p>This final trip will allow me to create photographs of the entire family together, as well as formal portraits of the men, women, and children that make up the Mira clan. During my past trips I have recorded stories and interviews relating to Gesar and will incorporate these texts and photographs in a book.</p>
<p>Take a look some of the images that I took in <a href=""http://kottie.gaydos.org/Kottie_Gaydos/Descendants_of_a_Warrior_King.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2010 </a>and in <a href=""http://kottie.gaydos.org/Kottie_Gaydos/Kham.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2011 </a>for this project.</p>

<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">The History &amp; The Impact</h3>
<p>The Khampas are ethnically Tibetan and live in what is now China's Garze Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Despite China's quickly modernizing cities Tagong, the closest town to the Mira clan's home, is in a remote mountainous region of Sichuan. </p>
<p>Khampas are beginning to use motorcycles as their main source of transportation, although horses remain a huge part of their lives. </p>
<p>The Khampas are known across China as being a tough warrior people. They look to Gesar not only as a god and source of inspiration but also as a model warrior for men and boys. When the Communist People's Liberation Army came into Khampa regions in the 1940's the Khampa's fought back. Both sides lost many people, but the Chinese still fear the Khampa sword. </p>
<p>While the Khampas are kind and eager to laugh their warrior history still holds weight. Quick tempers and family disputes often lead to knife fights, jail and death.</p>
<p>I am interested in the conflicting sides of Gesar's story, and his long lasting effect on the Khampas. Many Khampas in Tagong are tired of the deaths of local men who fall in these fights. A conversation is beginning to take place to stop these tragedies. This project is my exploration of that conversation and with your help it will be made available to people outside of Kham.</p>

<p>Hello, My name is Jimmy. My campaign is about bettering myself as a photographer and to help others as well. I am looking to upgrade some of my camera things that will make it able to capture better pictures and better moments. After being hurt on the job and completely disregarded by workers comp, i have started to do pictures for people inexpensively just to survive. I is to help me survive and to make sure people that if even on a tight budget they can still get pictures of their special moments. Photography has been a great therapy after losing my job when i was hurt. The pictures can come out so calming and soothing with great colors... and then to get compliments on me actually relieves my stress and anger at the whole situation. I am looking to upgrade so that i can do better pictures as well as expand if possible. </p>
<p>The funding will be going to a better flash so that i can take more rapid pictures at weddings and parties for people. Another battery so that i can take all of the pictures needed without running out of charge and losing the chance at precious moments because of it. Hoping to be able to set up a website to sell some prints of the ""Art"" i've set up and photo'd as well as the nature scenes i have been able to capture. Also, I have done a Trial of photoshop and it is absoulutely amazing when editing photos for people. There is a deal for 50 a month that includes all of the creative suite programs i would need so that would be another. Perks givin would be Prints of some nature scenes i have been able to capture. If unable to reach my goal it will still go towards my photography needs to help me better the things i am looking to upgrade.</p>
<p>The contributions made will be helping me to survive better and help me expand to better things and opportunities. This is what has calmed me for these 2 years of being hurt and fighting for justice that has never came. Now still in pain and mobility issues this is what i love to do and keeps my spirits up when im able to actually get out there and do it.</p>
</div>
<div>

<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>Hello Indiegoers!  Welcome!  My name is Mike Vickers and I'm a photographer.   All my life I've been in to art of some kind.  I started out with music performance then went to recording, then to video focusing mainly on editing.  I got a job at a store building and repairing computers designed specifically for video production.   One day the owner showed me the video coming out of a Canon D-SLR.   I was instantly taken by surprise at how good it looked compared to the dedicated video camera I had!   I ended up selling all of my video gear to buy that camera.  Before even receiving the new camera I decided I should sign up for photography classes in order to better use it for what it was originally designed for.  Photography!  As I got more in to photography ( and less in to video ) I ended up selling all of my music gear too to help fund my new photography addiction.</p>
<p>After over 4 years of shooting, my camera took a dive last month leaving me with a couple lenses &amp; strobes but no working camera body.  The majority of photography I shoot is costume or cosplay design sets which doesn't exactly pay much if anything at all.  I attend conventions whenever I can and have traveled all over the southeast just to shoot at them.  I rented a camera for AWA ( Anime Weekend in Atlanta ) but I can't always rent one whenever I want to.  Until I get a new camera there's not much I can do.  With your contribution though I can get back up and going and shooting the costumes you love!  This isn't just for the camera though.   This isn't just to travel.  This is to help me continue doing what I love!   Capturing art!  <br/></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Canon estimated the repairs on my camera to cost $1,011.25 plus another $103 for the battery pack.   Everyone I spoke with said it wasn't worth it to repair a 5 year old camera being that it was out on the market for a year before I purchased it.   After debating between several different models I decided to stick with the direct replacement of my Canon 5D mk2 and purchase a 5D mk3.   Retail price on this camera is $3,500.   True there are many cameras costing much less but it goes back to ""you get what you pay for.""  You wouldn't give a painter a box of crayons to create his next masterpiece or a sheet of sketch paper instead of a canvas would you?</p>
<p>Every single penny received will go towards the purchase of this new camera.  You're not just donating to me though because I will be giving something back!  For the first time <b><i>ever</i></b> and with the permission and support of several models I will be providing prints to all the contributors who donate $15 or more towards my camera fund.  Even if funding is not reached, I will still be purchasing this new camera!  The question is more a matter of <i>when</i> instead of <i>if</i>.  <br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>With your help, I will quickly get a new camera and be out there shooting again!   I have been studying photography for over 4 years now and have been attending conventions for nearly 2 years.  Just this year I have been to AL, GA, TN, KY, NC &amp; MD for various shoots and conventions!   If you like my photography, contributing to my cause will help me continue to travel and shoot with all of you amazing people!  With your contribution of $15 or more you'll also receive your favorite print and for an additional $5 I will get that model to autograph it for you!<br/><br/></span></span><h1><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><h3>Other Ways You Can Help<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span>

Hello Indiegoers!  Welcome!  My name is Mike Vickers and I'm a photographer.   All my life I've been in to art of some kind.  I started out with music performance then went to recording, then to video focusing mainly on editing.  I got a job at a store building and repairing computers designed specifically for video production.   One day the owner showed me the video coming out of a Canon D-SLR.   I was instantly taken by surprise at how good it looked compared to the dedicated video camera I had!   I ended up selling all of my video gear to buy that camera.  Before even receiving the new camera I decided I should sign up for photography classes in order to better use it for what it was originally designed for.  Photography!  As I got more in to photography ( and less in to video ) I ended up selling all of my music gear too to help fund my new photography addiction.
After over 4 years of shooting, my camera took a dive last month leaving me with a couple lenses & strobes but no working camera body.  The majority of photography I shoot is costume or cosplay design sets which doesn't exactly pay much if anything at all.  I attend conventions whenever I can and have traveled all over the southeast just to shoot at them.  I rented a camera for AWA ( Anime Weekend in Atlanta ) but I can't always rent one whenever I want to.  Until I get a new camera there's not much I can do.  With your contribution though I can get back up and going and shooting the costumes you love!  This isn't just for the camera though.   This isn't just to travel.  This is to help me continue doing what I love!   Capturing art!  
What I Need & What You Get
Canon estimated the repairs on my camera to cost $1,011.25 plus another $103 for the battery pack.   Everyone I spoke with said it wasn't worth it to repair a 5 year old camera being that it was out on the market for a year before I purchased it.   After debating between several different models I decided to stick with the direct replacement of my Canon 5D mk2 and purchase a 5D mk3.   Retail price on this camera is $3,500.   True there are many cameras costing much less but it goes back to ""you get what you pay for.""  You wouldn't give a painter a box of crayons to create his next masterpiece or a sheet of sketch paper instead of a canvas would you?
Every single penny received will go towards the purchase of this new camera.  You're not just donating to me though because I will be giving something back!  For the first time ever and with the permission and support of several models I will be providing prints to all the contributors who donate $15 or more towards my camera fund.  Even if funding is not reached, I will still be purchasing this new camera!  The question is more a matter of when instead of if.  
The ImpactWith your help, I will quickly get a new camera and be out there shooting again!   I have been studying photography for over 4 years now and have been attending conventions for nearly 2 years.  Just this year I have been to AL, GA, TN, KY, NC & MD for various shoots and conventions!   If you like my photography, contributing to my cause will help me continue to travel and shoot with all of you amazing people!  With your contribution of $15 or more you'll also receive your favorite print and for an additional $5 I will get that model to autograph it for you!Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't contribute financially, or even if you can, please feel free to spread the word and share this page!  If you want to contribute in any other way, or if you have any suggestions on how to make this campaign more successful, feel free to comment below.   Thank you!Photos

If there are any particular prints you'd like to see, comment below and I'll speak with the model and see if I can make it available!  If we've shot together and you'd like to purchase a print of yourself, message me and I'll have it printed!  If you'd like to purchase a print in any other size or format such as canvas, let me know!  Photos are originally a 2:3 ratio but have been cropped to show how they will look on an 11x14 print.*Additional fees for any and all international shipping.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>KINGS AND QUEENS : THIRD SHIFT</h3>
<p>Third Shift is a digital artist and photographer based out of Iowa City, IA. He is passionate about telling stories that change the perceptions and stereotypes of marginalized societies. Kings and Queens is a humanizing look into the world of Drag culture. Although dressing drag is becoming more widely accepted, this series takes an interesting look at the men and women dressing and less about their drag personas. Proceeds will go to high quality gallery prints and frames to be shown in April 2017.   </p>
<h3>COSTS BROKEN DOWN</h3>
<p>I am choosing to print through <a href=""https://www.artifactuprising.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artifact Uprising</a> based out of LA. </p>
<p>There are 20 pieces in the Kings and Queens gallery.</p>
<p>Each framed print will cost about $140 - $150</p>
<p>Total Cost: $3000</p>
<h3>WHY DONATE?</h3>
<p>LGBTQ Rights are a very hot topic as of late. The inequality the LGBTQ community faces on a daily basis is unacceptable and I think it stems from people uneducated on the topic. What Kings and Queens aims to do is bridge that gap. It humanizes the drag community to those who it isn't readily available to.  </p>

<p>ça va, Bonjour, Hello... </p>
<p>Here is a little about me, I am a total nut when it comes to photography and art! I am creative by nature and like to think that ""I create right brain solutions for a left brain world"" even though my pedigree is in the mechanical engineering field I like to interject my creative side in everything I do.  My main interests drive me towords drawing, photography and playing my guitar, and each one has a common point amongst themselves and that is each one allows me to tell a story without words through each unique media and that is what I am trying to convey with my photo prints and photobook here on indiegogo. I am taking my hobby of photography, and love of Paris cemeteries and melded them together to create a unique view of Pere Lachaise cemetery through my ""voice"" of print.  My campaign ultimately is to bring you the viewer of the photo print or book a different and new perspective of the famous Parisian cemetery, whether you have never been to this Parisian treasure, or you have visited several times these images will either bring back memories or bring a new curiosity to this amazing location and potentially become a future destination.  The ultimate goal of my campaign would be to help fund another future projects, one; which would be ""Paris is to die for... dead of winter"" same concept as this book but shooting the cemetery in the ""dead"" of winter as well as other future projects covering the other remaining 2 famous cemeteries (Montparnasse, and Monte Martre)</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What is our goal for this campaign? well we are looking for $22,000 to help start book publishing of my initial coffee table book called ""Paris is to die for..."" and to help with our future project website which will sell a softcover version of this book as well as other prints exclusive to the website (prints will be limited edition and will not be offered again after 4 months from print release). The unique offer of this campaign is that we will only be offering a limited edition of 175 13x11 HARD COVER coffee table books and 5 limited edition matte prints (each separate individual purchases).  If we do not meet our goal, no worries; if you purchased a book and/or prints from this campaign we will honor your generosity and ship out your campaign perk(s)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a saturated world of Parisian picture books that document that same thing over and over again, ""paris is to die for..."" is a refreshing addition to to the world of Parisian picture books and would be a welcome addition to your home or office and might just be a conversation starter.  You don't have to be into the weird and creepy to fully enjoy the true beauty of this 110 acre wonder which is often overlooked and passed on by for the common tourist traps</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you feel that this campaign might not be your cup of tea, we ask that you spread the word to those you know who might be interested in our artistic and creative prints and book documenting Pere Lachaise cemetery.</p>
<p>OR go ahead and use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word!</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<ul><li>I have been working in the photography Industry in various capacities for the last 10 years. This MA has given me the time and space to work on a long term personal project whilst developing my sense of place within photography. I have gained valuable experience and contacts that have all played their part in bringing this project to life, and It would be amazing to be able to show this project in my first solo show and in a published book.</li></ul>
<p>What I need and what you get:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>To bring this project and book to life, I am looking for £2500. This will be split between the two main areas. The design time has already been incredibly generously donated by Dan at <a href=""https://www.honeststudio.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Honest Studio</a> in Bath, and he shall be taking care of the design layout, print production and project management of both he book design, and a new website to launch with this project which I am funding. Half of the money raised  by this Indiegogo campaign will be spent on getting the books printed. I plan to get an edition fo 100 signed and numbered books printed to be available at the exhibition private view and any remaining books to be sold on my website. The remainder will be spent on framing, photograph printing costs and materials for hanging the show, and the private view.

This MA has given me the time and space to work on a long term personal project whilst developing my sense of place within photography. I have gained valuable experience and contacts that have all played their part in bringing this project to life, and It would be amazing to be able to show this project in my first solo show and in a published book.
What I need and what you get:


To bring this project and book to life, I am looking for £2500. This will be split between the two main areas. The design time has already been incredibly generously donated by Dan at Honest Studio in Bath, and he shall be taking care of the design layout, print production and project management of both he book design, and a new website to launch with this project which I am funding. Half of the money raised  by this Indiegogo campaign will be spent on getting the books printed. I plan to get an edition fo 100 signed and numbered books printed to be available at the exhibition private view and any remaining books to be sold on my website. The remainder will be spent on framing, photograph printing costs and materials for hanging the show, and the private view. The labour involved with the framing is also being generously given free of charge by Malcom at Portico Art Gallery. Any money left over will be spent on a second edition of the book and further exhibitions of this project later in the year which are already in the planning stages.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>My name is Sean Patrick Hill, and I am entering the second part of my life. Through photography, I honestly feel I've been reborn. I've found a calling in life, loud and clear. When I picked up my father's film camera, after it sat in the closet for many years, it was a way to honor him, I felt. Now the camera has grown to fill my life.</p>
<p>I'm a writer, poet, photographer, and single dad living in Louisville, Kentucky. I juggle a career as a content writer, caring for my daughter, and, whenever I can, dragging my cameras into the field and coming home to work in the darkroom. On the side, for extra money (and maybe a bit of extra glory), I write and publish articles locally and nationally.</p>
<p>Where did all this start? A childhood of looking at photographs in books, encyclopedias, and magazines. My grandparents' houses, adorned with years of portraits.  When I was about 12 years old, my father bought a Pentax K1000 35mm camera. He gave me the old 1970's Kodak Instamatic camera he'd been using. I loved it. Over the years, I shot on all sorts of cameras—mostly snapshots, but every so often something I thought might be ""art.""</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2003, when I was living in Bend, Oregon, my father mailed me the K1000. For years I shot film, color, black and white. </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> time, I </span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">bought a small Sony digital camera; maybe I thought film wasn't worth the cost. Then, in 2013, I got my first iPhone, not least of all for the camera.</span></p>
<p>But in the fall of 2017, three years after my father died of cancer, I took the Pentax from the closet. And once I started shooting, I never stopped. I quickly moved up to medium format and, finally, to large-format photography, which I've been shooting now for one year. I built a darkroom. I develop my own film, and I make silver gelatin prints--all in the traditional way.</p>
<p>What really interests me, among many other things, is landscape photography. In June, I took my 4x5 Sinar-F to Utah. I shot 50 sheets of film in Arches and Capitol Reef National Parks. By now, I've felt my passion; large-format photography is, for me, a vocation.</p>
<p>So why Death Valley? Because like my trip to Utah, my heroes have shot there: Ansel Adams, Edward Weston. And the instructor for this workshop, Lynn Radeka. Death Valley is MADE for black and white photography.</p>
<p>This is my chance to work with a master, to fully learn the fundamentals of not so much how to work the camera (though I know there are tricks I haven't yet thought of) but rather how to compose a powerful shot. This gives me an opportunity to create a body of work that I hope to show in a gallery and, ultimately, to sell as prints.</p>
<p>Your help will cover the enormous expenses of traveling to Death Valley, and of lodging and feeding myself. You'll also help me pay for the film (large-format is expensive; a single photograph costs $2 an exposure!) and get my gear ready—calibrating my light meter and shutters, getting replacement parts for the camera, and so on.</p>
<p>Most of all, your help will launch me into my life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am setting the goal at $3,500.</p>
<p>What that covers is workshop tuition ($1,200), lodging ($900), a flight (+/- $600), and car rental (+/- $300). The remaining $500 will cover food, film, printing paper, and CLA's for my equipment (in short, calibrating them, fixing them up, etc).</p>
<p>What I am offering you for your help are images. The images will range from a digital file you can use as a wallpaper to an archival-quality, mounted silver gelatin print that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>Any funds help. Between the tuition and travel and accommodations, your donations will ease the cost</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The most simple thing that will come of this workshop is ART. That is to say, fine arts photographs—for you, certainly, and for anyone else.</p>
<p>But for me, professionally, the images I collect can be used for much more.</p>
<p>I can use images to apply for professional and creative grants. As a poet, I've secured grants from the Kentucky Arts Council, the Elizabeth George Foundation, and more.</p>
<p>I can use the images to apply for fellowships, such as Light Work, an organization in Syracuse, New York, where I could spend up to a month photographing my home state. I've received fellowships from the Vermont Studio Center, the Montana Arts Refuge, and Fishtrap.</p>
<p>I can publish them in photography magazines and art journals (and some of my images have, in fact, been published). </p>
<p>Currently, I am working on my negatives from Capitol Reef National Park. I will use those images to apply to be an artist-in-residence at Capitol Reef. With Death Valley being a national park, I can use those images to apply at other parks, as well.</p>
<p>As a writer, I've created a pretty good reputation and a decent track record: books, publications, and awards. My dream is to couple my writing with my photography; who knows where that will lead?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What are the risks? Few. I suppose I can try to not die in the desert, but in December I think I'll be OK. I may damage my camera (done that before). I may run out of film. But in general, the challenge will be entirely artistic. So long as I don't mess up my exposures, or accidentally expose my film (done that, done that), I will create great negatives.</p>
<p>Granted, I may have to drive to Nevada, in which case gas money will go a long way!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>By all means, please, tell your friends. Know someone who loves photography? Black and white? Tell them there's a guy that needs a bit of kindness.</p>
<p>Share this post. The more people know, the greater the chances for backers.</p>

It combines <strong>travelling, teaching and storytelling</strong>. For years, timelapse photography has been a way for me to share my story, to share my way of seeing the world around us. Beauty is everywhere, you just need to see it! I use timelapse photography to share that message around the world and this is what this Timelapse Master Class 2021 is all about! </p><p>This Master Class will teach you everything you need to know about the craft, and everything behind it. I will share with you my expert secrets to have a 100% success rate when going on location, you will never waste your time again! But you will also learn <strong>how to shoot amazing and flawless motion control timelapses</strong>, <strong>how to capture the smoothest hyperlapse videos</strong> or <strong>how to shoot breathtaking astro-timelapses, drone-hyperlapses and more</strong>. This Master Class will also come with projects, tons of bonus videos and free assets to practice at the same time!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615439702/ft7fzqqozwam6jutiteg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M1iyEu_DfRH5mGjMfMkjrQidxVkBRdPd/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Click here to see the full list of videos included in the Timelapse Master Class 2021.</strong></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Keep scrolling for more detailed information about the TMC21!</strong></i></p><div>

<h3>Where will the fundraising money go?</h3>
</div><p>As you might know, creating such a big online master class requires a lot of work. <strong>So far, the TMC21 has 42 videos, 11 officially done and exported, 6 at the editing stage and 5 already written ready to be recorded</strong>. The TMC21 is already<strong> 3+ hour long and will be around 10-15 hours long once completed.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>The TMC21 takes place all around the United States, from Chicago, to Miami to Los Angeles or New York</strong>, and even in some amazing and beautiful National Parks of the American Southwest such as Yosemite and Joshua Tree!  <strong>There is nothing better than being on location to share my knowledge and my passion.</strong></p><p> </p><p>The money will be smartly split into 4 different categories:</p><p><strong>1 - Camera operator:</strong> I will hire a camera operator so I, Emeric, can focus on teaching and sharing my knowledge to provide a <strong>more personalized course</strong>. Hiring a cameraman will help me create visually nicer videos! </p><p><strong>2 - Travel fees:</strong> Since the TMC21 takes place all over the US,  the travel cost will add up and your donations will help me travel to different location to shoot different classes for you! <strong>So far, I have travelled to Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, Yosemite and San Francisco for the TMC21.</strong> There are many more locations left such as New York City, Las Vegas and Joshua Tree for the remaining videos. I will also travel to other cities and national parks in the future and <strong>add new videos to the master class for FREE!</strong></p><p><strong>3 - A new website</strong>: For the past 3 months, I have been working on a <strong>brand new website</strong> to watch all my online classes on a <strong>secure server</strong>. You will be able to keep track of your progress, ask questions about each lesson, watch the classes you purchased one after the other with a good video player and much more.</p><p><strong>4 - Efficiency</strong>: This project is so big that it's really tough for me to focus on it every single day! I also need to think about other projects that will help pay the bills a little faster. Having a bigger budget for the TMC21 will help me <strong>write, shoot and edit the videos way faster than normal.</strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615490371/ed4kxyqjtye8ka2lxxlq.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Those are the first 8 destinations included in the TMC21! I will add free lessons as I travel to new locations like Denver, San Diego, Seattle and other National Parks.</p><h3>
<br/><strong>What is the difference between the TMC21 and Emeric's Timelapse previous classes?</strong>
</h3><p>The main difference with any other timelapse classes I have released so far is the <strong>""on location"" teaching around the United States</strong>, along with the advanced timelapse and hyperlapse techniques I have never taught before.</p><p>A huge section of this TMC21 is showing you <strong>how I approach different cityscapes in the US</strong>.  This is my favorite part of the Master Class as I will be sharing my knowledge on location while capturing America's most beautiful cities!</p><p>For the first time as well,<strong> I will be teaching motion control timelapses with 1, 2 and 3 axis setups</strong>. I will give you TONS of tips and tricks to create better motion control timelapses, even day-to-night.</p><p>I will teach you how to capture amazing and <strong>beautiful hyperlapses and drone-hyperlapses.</strong></p><p>Finally, I will have 8 videos about <strong>how to capture nature and astro-timelapses </strong>in some of the most beautiful National Parks of the American Southwest.</p><p>The TMC21 will be a great addition to the TMC19 which has taught you how to create and sell you work online. TMC19 and TMC21 will create the ultimate timelapse master class combo!</p><h3> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here is a short sneak peek of some of the TMC21 lessons I have already shot and edited.</h3><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDNF6Ze3RL8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3> </h3><h3>Your donation will also get you some perks!</h3><p>Anyone who donates to making TMC21 a reality will receive one of the perks below based on the amount of your donation.

It combines travelling, teaching and storytelling. For years, timelapse photography has been a way for me to share my story, to share my way of seeing the world around us. Beauty is everywhere, you just need to see it! I use timelapse photography to share that message around the world and this is what this Timelapse Master Class 2021 is all about! This Master Class will teach you everything you need to know about the craft, and everything behind it. I will share with you my expert secrets to have a 100% success rate when going on location, you will never waste your time again! But you will also learn how to shoot amazing and flawless motion control timelapses, how to capture the smoothest hyperlapse videos or how to shoot breathtaking astro-timelapses, drone-hyperlapses and more. This Master Class will also come with projects, tons of bonus videos and free assets to practice at the same time!Click here to see the full list of videos included in the Timelapse Master Class 2021.Keep scrolling for more detailed information about the TMC21!
 
Where will the fundraising money go?
As you might know, creating such a big online master class requires a lot of work. So far, the TMC21 has 42 videos, 11 officially done and exported, 6 at the editing stage and 5 already written ready to be recorded. The TMC21 is already 3+ hour long and will be around 10-15 hours long once completed. The TMC21 takes place all around the United States, from Chicago, to Miami to Los Angeles or New York, and even in some amazing and beautiful National Parks of the American Southwest such as Yosemite and Joshua Tree!  There is nothing better than being on location to share my knowledge and my passion. The money will be smartly split into 4 different categories:1 - Camera operator: I will hire a camera operator so I, Emeric, can focus on teaching and sharing my knowledge to provide a more personalized course. Hiring a cameraman will help me create visually nicer videos! 2 - Travel fees: Since the TMC21 takes place all over the US,  the travel cost will add up and your donations will help me travel to different location to shoot different classes for you! So far, I have travelled to Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles, Yosemite and San Francisco for the TMC21. There are many more locations left such as New York City, Las Vegas and Joshua Tree for the remaining videos. I will also travel to other cities and national parks in the future and add new videos to the master class for FREE!3 - A new website: For the past 3 months, I have been working on a brand new website to watch all my online classes on a secure server. You will be able to keep track of your progress, ask questions about each lesson, watch the classes you purchased one after the other with a good video player and much more.4 - Efficiency: This project is so big that it's really tough for me to focus on it every single day! I also need to think about other projects that will help pay the bills a little faster. Having a bigger budget for the TMC21 will help me write, shoot and edit the videos way faster than normal. Those are the first 8 destinations included in the TMC21! I will add free lessons as I travel to new locations like Denver, San Diego, Seattle and other National Parks.
What is the difference between the TMC21 and Emeric's Timelapse previous classes?
The main difference with any other timelapse classes I have released so far is the ""on location"" teaching around the United States, along with the advanced timelapse and hyperlapse techniques I have never taught before.A huge section of this TMC21 is showing you how I approach different cityscapes in the US.  This is my favorite part of the Master Class as I will be sharing my knowledge on location while capturing America's most beautiful cities!For the first time as well, I will be teaching motion control timelapses with 1, 2 and 3 axis setups. I will give you TONS of tips and tricks to create better motion control timelapses, even day-to-night.I will teach you how to capture amazing and beautiful hyperlapses and drone-hyperlapses.Finally, I will have 8 videos about how to capture nature and astro-timelapses in some of the most beautiful National Parks of the American Southwest.The TMC21 will be a great addition to the TMC19 which has taught you how to create and sell you work online. TMC19 and TMC21 will create the ultimate timelapse master class combo! Here is a short sneak peek of some of the TMC21 lessons I have already shot and edited.   Your donation will also get you some perks!Anyone who donates to making TMC21 a reality will receive one of the perks below based on the amount of your donation.

The entire production took a hit and was delayed.Now, in March 2021, the TMC21 is over 30% done with 11 videos officially exported, and 5 more already in the editing software. For the first time ever, the TMC21 will come with over 7 different projects (homework) and a 20 multiple answers question quiz to pass the class. You will also receive a free 30 minute video call with me Emeric to discuss your projects. The different projects and quiz are needed if you want to officially pass the class! Some cool numbers!

<h3>About Us and Our Campaign</h3>
<p>We are Ben Maier, Emily Josephine Rooney, Emma Grima and Lina Selg - four good goofy friends from Germany, Pennsylvania (US),  Malta and Germany again and photography students at the Royal Academy of Arts, NL.</p>
<p>In February 2021, the four of us founded Pineapple Road Press and began working on a photographic publication called ‚Under Her Gaze We Feel Golden‘, which - all inspired by the summer sun - tells a tale of collective hopes and longings. </p>
<p>More than just to collaborate between us, we wanted to work with others in and outside of our own university's walls, to have a diverse publication and to make new connections. We sent an open call to students of the <strong>Fotobus Society</strong> (students from different art universities, Germany), <strong>Moholy-Nagy University</strong> (Hungary) and our own, <strong>Royal Academy of Arts </strong>(Netherlands), asking the students to take part with an image of their own which expressed something they longed for, or their escapes. (We received a lot of really cool and beautiful images!) </p>
<p>We’ve missed these connections, we still miss togetherness, both with friends and strangers. This publication will be - and already is - an ode to this and many more longings; and an escape from the claustrophobia of society.  </p>
<p>You can take it as a catalyst to reflect on this society, or as an escape itself; a reminder of the light-heartedness of being, and the innocent joy of summer sun on your skin. </p>
<p>We also hope that this project can be a starting point to get to know students of the same field, to collaborate and support each other.   </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>How Can You Help Us</h3>
<p>We need your help to turn our longings into a physical reality: to make this publication a printed one. With this crowdfunding, we are raising the money to cover the print costs. </p>
<p>You can help us to make this love experiment of ours happen by donating, by pre-ordering our publication or by acquiring any of the other wonderful big and little perks which all come with a whole lot of love!  </p>

<h2>“Art, freedom and creativity will change society <i>faster</i> than politics.”</h2>

<p>Welcome!</p>
<p>My name is Bernard Webb. I am an Anglo-American fine arts photographer residing in Hove, East Sussex<br/></p>
<p>""Wet feet"" will be my first solo exhibition and what better place for this than the Naked Eye gallery in Hove!  This is a culmination of a lot of shooting over the past year. The title ""wet feet"" coincides with the fact that I have got my feet wet on numerous occasions when taking pictures on the beach, and after twenty six years of being in America everything seems so raw and new for me.  With this exhibition I want people to see beyond the familiar backdrop of their lives, and see the beauty and drama of living in this coastal town.<br/></p>
<p>So really, what are you contributing to?  I liken it to recording 
songs, this is my crowd funded album!  Your contributions will help with
 renting gallery space for two weeks, printing, framing and mounting, and producing a limited run book to accompany the work. Naked Eye gallery and I will 
take care of promoting the venue for the opening night and for the rest 
of the show...I can't wait!!!!<br/></p>
<p>Donating to this event could not be easier.  Paypal is set up and ready and there are different levels of donation.  Of course, anything is welcome; to have you as part of this exhibition will mean the world to me. It will help promote my vision and to continue my work across this city and beyond, so in advance...thank you!</p>Bernard J Webb<br/><a href=""http://www.bjwphotography.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bjwphotography.net</a><br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>Campaign Information</h3>
<p>My name is Verna and I'm a former teacher turned photographer living in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p><br/>A few years ago, after returning from London and Paris with hundreds of photos, I shared my travel experience with my students.  After answering several of their questions about my travels, I remembered that a lot of the students I taught did not come from families that could afford travel beyond the US.</p>
<p>In an effort to change that, I came up with the idea of World Class: A Photo Expedition Abroad.</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>What is World Class?</strong><br/><br/> World Class: A Photo Expedition Abroad is a way for students that wouldn't otherwise have the means to travel overseas, to learn about the world they live in.  In addition to reading and learning about foreign lands in books and in the classroom, students will have the chance to actually be there.  Each day they will act as photo journalists being immersed in the culture and sharing their experiences through photography and words.</div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Mystika Glamoor is the high priestess of Edinburgh drag, a tarot card reader as well as hostess of her weekly drag show, GLAMOOR! Having worked for almost a year at the show with the amazing young photographer Lou McCurdy, the two of them now plan on mixing their passion for both drag and the mystical arts into a tarot-themed photography project that they also hope to turn into a physical deck of cards!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are both young LGBTQ artists balancing our day jobs with our passion projects, and Lou is still in University. In order to cover our costs for materials and transport to make this a truly stunning deck, we need your help! Plus, we fully dream of creating an actual physical deck of cards, which can be yours for a donation of £50! This covers both printing and delivery costs with a little extra going to support the campaign.  Other cheaper perks include tarot readings and prints of one of the portraits of your choosing! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help we'll be able to create a piece of art that merges the world of spirituality and queer culture, and a true testimony of the work possible when supporting local queer artists! The tarot and all other forms of magick are powerful tools of self-realisation that prove particularly helpful for queer people, who are so often marginalised and given a lesser role in the worldm so we hope to spread more awareness of the cards message and their power.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious project, both due to the rich imagery and symbolism in the cards, plus the sheer amount of portraits that need to be made. We have decided to focus on the Major Arcana, AKA the first 22 cards of the tarot, and add some cards that alude to the Minor Arcana and three personal symbolic cards. This is due to simply being realistic with our deadline of next April and allowing us to focus properly on what we can do to the best of our abilities, creating a visually stunning deck and allowing us to potentially work on further cards in the future. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, please spread the word! Share on social media and directly with your friends who you feel would be interested in such a project! Both queer and spiritual circles are sure to love what we hope to create!</p>
</div><p>Thank you to all of you, we can't wait to create this beautifully challenging work xx</p></div>","Short Summary

<br/><p>During the last 5 years I photographed many women in Barcelona. I encouraged them to explore their sensuality in front of my camera without limits and invited them to move freely without imitating the typical glamour poses or pretending something they didn't feel.</p>

<p>The photos were taken in the showers, the kitchen, the living room or on the terrace of my studio-flat, on the ancient sofa that already appeared in my early work many years ago and in the narrow streets just around the corner in my neighbourhood, ""El Borne"", in the old town of the magic city of Barcelona...</p>

<br/><h3>Real photography. Real women.<br/>

<p>Despite of the modern and young look of the photographs, I see myself as an old school photographer. Instead of adding effects or enhancing pictures using editing software, I work in the classical way with the light and the camera. <br/></p>
<p>During the sessions I create an atmosphere in which the portrayed women can feel free and safe.

<p align=""left""><b>What is <i>ON DAIDO </i>?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The book <i>ON DAIDO</i> is a photographic anthology of statements and homages to the Japanese photographer Daido Moriyama made by internationally acclaimed photographers and writers. This publication is dedicated to him and will be available in a special edition of 500 copies on the occasion of the 7th Fotobookfestival Kassel in June 2015. FBF Books, the publishing branch of the not-for-profit Fotobookfestival Kassel will publish this book. Your support of this Indiegogo project will make this special publication possible. </p>

<p></p>
<b>Why and How?</b>
<p></p>Daido Moriyama is undoubtedly one of the most important photographers of all times. But who is this reserved, likeable man from Tokyo, who has affected the development of Japanese photography like no other? Which overwhelming energy is behind this fascinating simplicity in the art of photography? How is it possible that his images, no matter how they are cropped, reproduced, rotated or flipped, still manage to keep their core essence? How does one approach the Daido Moriyama phenomenon? We asked 31 photographers and 21 writers to help us find an answer by way of visual and textual statements. We requested appraisal and acclaim, commentary and feedback. Our request predominantly met with a resoundingly positive response and immediate approval. The resulting anthology <i>ON DAIDO</i> paints a multifaceted picture of the great renewer of photography. Essentially, it does not so much pay homage to an individual, as celebrate the photographic medium as a whole. We are grateful to the photographers and authors for their participation. We wish to carry on spreading and understanding the great work of Daido Moriyama through this anthology. Let's do it together.<p></p>

<p>Zusammengefasst: Unser Ziel ist es, das erste und einzige duale Baseball und Softball Feld in Duisburg zu bauen. Die Arbeiten auf einem alten Fußballplatz in Duisburg-Neumühl haben bereits begonnen und wir sammeln nun Spenden um die Basiselemente des Feldes zu finanzieren. Wenn wir das Ziel erreichen sollten wir den Platz bis Juni 2013 fertig haben, sodass man noch die zweite Hälfte des Sommers damit verbringen kann, darauf zu spielen.</p>
<p>Alle Spenden gehen ohne Umwege an folgende Projektgruppen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hauptsachen<ol>
<li>Die Umzäunung des Platzes: Der bestehende Platz ist fast komplett mit einem Geländer umzäunt, an welches wir Maschendraht befestigen wollen um den Spielbereich einzugrenzen.</li>
<li>Backstop: Zwei sehr hohe Backstops sind nötig um die angrenzenden Gebäude hinter den jeweiligen Homeplates zu schützen. Dies sollte an sich kein Problem sein, doch wir haben vor kurzem erfahren, dass die Fundamente sehr tief (und somit sehr teuer) sein müssen da der Baugrund zu sandig ist.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Nebensachen<ol>
<li>Aschebahn und ""Pitcher's Mound"": Da neue Asche ziemlich teuer ist, haben wir uns dazu entschieden alte Tennisasche zu recyceln. Da Tennisplätze jeden Frühling ihre Asche erneuern kann man diese günstig erwerben. Im Moment planen wir, nur kleine Aschefelder um die Bases und Home Plate herum anzulegen, aber mit Ihrer Hilfe könnten wir richtige Aschebahnen zwischen den Bases bauen.</li>
<li>Dugouts: Die größten kosten beim Bau der Dugoutsn liegen bei dem Baugutachten, der Bauzulassung und den Betonfundamenten. Die Dugouts selbst werden aus jeglichen gespendeten Materialien gebaut, damit wir den Spielern so schnell wie möglich Unterschlupf vor dem Regen bieten können.</li>
<li>Geräteschuppen: Wir versuchen ein oder zwei gebrauchte Container aufzutreiben damit wir dort unsere Garten-, Wartungs- und Trainingsgeräte unterbringen können.</li>
<li>Außerhalb des Platzes: Der Platz ist auf allen Seiten von ungepflegten Dornenbüschen und Unkraut umgeben. Wir haben vor jegliches Unkraut und Baumstumpfe zu entfernen und stattdessen Gras dort zu pflanzen, damit jeder der sich unsere Spiele angucken möchte auch einen Platz zum sitzen findet.</li>

<p>Die Welt braucht mehr Baseball!</p>
<h3>Ein bisschen zur Geschichte</h3>
<p>Die Baseball und Softball Teams des <strong>1. ASC Duisburg Dockers</strong> spielen schon seit sehr langer Zeit auf dem alten Fußballplatz im Schwelgernstadion, welcher heute hauptsächlich als American Football Platz genutzt wird. Die Wiese ist stark abgenutzt und zu sagen der Boden ist uneben wäre eine Untertreibung. Die lange, schmale Form des Platzes und die umgebende Aschelaufbahn tragen auch nicht wirklich zu unserem Nutzen bei.</p>
<p>Wir haben schon vor Jahren die Suche nach einem neuen Platz begonnen. Das größte Problem ist dass Duisburg mitten im Ruhrgebiet liegt und die Bevölkerungsdichte hier die höchste in Europa ist. Es gibt nur wenige große, offene Flächen, die man sich leisten kann, und in der Geschichte des Baseballs und Softballs in NRW mussten viele Vereine deswegen ihre Sachen packen und umziehen oder ganz aufhören. Erst letztes Jahr haben wir endlich den unbenutzten Fußballplatz ergattern können, was uns große Freude brachte (und immer noch bringt!).</p>
<p>Wir haben sofort mit den Baumaßnahmen begonnen.</p>
<h3>Was wurde bisher erreicht?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Als allererstes wurde das Feld innerhalb des Geländers gepflügt, geebnet und letztes Jahr mit neuem Gras bepflanzt</li>
<li>Von der Stadt vorgegebene Bodenstudien, die für die Bauerlaubnis der Backstops und Dugouts nötigt sind, wurden durchgeführt.</li>
<li>Die Brombeerbüsche wurden 2012 über Wochen von Freiwilligen aus den verschiedenen Teams aus dem Boden gerissen, klein gehäckselt und wieder über die Erde zerstreut. Damit ist die Arbeit dort aber leider nicht getan, da immer wieder neues Unkraut (besonders Brennnessel) dort wächst. Deswegen müssen wir diese Bereiche so schnell es geht mit Gras bepflanzen.</li>
</ul><h3>Über die Duisburg Dockers</h3>
<p>Der 1. American Sports Club Duisburg Dockers wurde 1986 als American Football Team gegründet. Bis zum heutigen Tage ist der Verein stetig gewachsen und beinhaltet heute American Football, Flag Football, Cheerleading, Baseball, Softball und seit Februar 2013 Wrestling.</p>
<p>Die Baseball und Softball Abteilung ist Teil des BSVNRW (Baseball &amp; Softball Verband Nordrhein-Westfalen) und beinhaltet im Moment drei Baseball Teams (Jugend, Junioren und Herren) und zwei Softball Teams (Damen und ein gemischtes Freizeitteam).</p>
<p> </p>

<div>
<h3>What we are trying to do</h3>
<p>In short: we are trying to build the first and only dual baseball &amp; softball field in Duisburg. Work has already started on an old football pitch in Duisburg-Neumühl, and we are now raising funds to finance and complete some of the basic elements for these fields. If the target is reached, we should be able finish working on the field by June 2013, which in turn means that people can enjoy the second half of the Summer playing on it.</p>
<p>Any funds collected will go directly towards the following structures and facilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Essential:<ol>
<li>Fencing around the fields: the field is almost completely surrounded by a handrail, which we will cover with wire mesh fencing to enclose the playing surface.</li>
<li>Backstop: two high backstops are necessary, as there are some industrial and commercial buildings behind where both homeplates will go. This should be simple enough, but we recently received bad news from the building consultant that the foundations will have to be very deep (and therefore expensive) because the soil is too sandy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Non-essential:<ol>
<li>Dirt tracks and pitching mound: New clay is prohibitively expensive in Germany, so it was decided that we will recycle tennis clay for this purpose. Luckily enough, tennis clubs redo their courts every spring. We have planned for dirt areas around the bases and home plate, but with your help, we might be able to do a whole infield track.</li>
<li>Dugouts: the bulk of the funds for dugouts will go to building inspectors, building permits, and pouring a concrete foundation. The dugouts themselves will be built out whatever donated materials we can get our hands on, so we can keep players out of the rain as soon as we can.</li>
<li>Equipment container(s): we are looking to obtain one or two used containers to store gardening, maintenance, and training equipment.</li>
<li>Around the field: the field is surrounded on 4 sides by unkept, bushy, poison-nettle infested areas. The idea is to remove the unwanted greenery and the tree stumps. Then resow with grass, so that people that would want to watch a game, have actually somewhere to sit on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The vision</h3>
<p>Currently 5 baseball and softball teams of all genders and ages play as Duisburg Dockers. We hope a purpose-built field will attract more attention to these amazing sports, as well as get some new members for the teams. We are especially interested in starting two new t-ball teams for the smallest kids in Duisburg!</p>
<p>The world needs more baseball!</p>
<h3>A bit of history</h3>
<p>For a very long time, the baseball and softball teams of the <strong>1. ASC Duisburg Dockers</strong> have been playing on an old football pitch in the <em>Schwelgernstadion</em>, which is primarily now used as an American Football field. The grass is severely worn, and the ground is uneven to say the least. The shape of the pitch and the running track surrounding it are unhelpful at best.</p>
<p>For years the search for a suitable surface went on. The main difficulty being that Duisburg was smack in the middle of the Ruhr Area, the highest populated urban area in Europe. Affordable, large open spaces, are really hard to come by, and throughout the history of baseball and softball in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, many teams had to fold or relocate because of this. Only last year did we finally get the abandoned soccer pitch. We were (and still are!) extatic about this.</p>
<p>Work on it began right away.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What has been done so far?</h3>
<ul>
<li>First and most importantly, the field within the handrails was ploughed, evened and suitable grass was sown last year. </li>
<li>Soil studies were conducted by an inspector, as required by the city, in order to obtain the building permits for the backstops and the dugouts.</li>
<li>The bushes surrounding the field were disposed off over weeks in 2012 by volunteers of the different teams. This work is ongoing, as the weeds, especially the poison nettle, always come back. This is why we need to put grass there ASAP.</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the Duisburg Dockers</h3>
<p>The 1. American Sports Club Duisburg Dockers started in 1986 as an American Football team. To this day, the club has expanded itself and now includes American Football, Flag Football, Cheerleading, Baseball, Softball, and since February 2013, Wrestling. </p>
<p>The Baseball &amp; Softball department is a member of the BSVNRW, and currently consists of 3 baseball teams (youth, junior and men's) and 2 softball teams (ladies and a mixed recreational team). </p>

Zusammengefasst: Unser Ziel ist es, das erste und einzige duale Baseball und Softball Feld in Duisburg zu bauen.

Wenn wir das Ziel erreichen sollten wir den Platz bis Juni 2013 fertig haben, sodass man noch die zweite Hälfte des Sommers damit verbringen kann, darauf zu spielen.
Alle Spenden gehen ohne Umwege an folgende Projektgruppen:

Hauptsachen
Die Umzäunung des Platzes: Der bestehende Platz ist fast komplett mit einem Geländer umzäunt, an welches wir Maschendraht befestigen wollen um den Spielbereich einzugrenzen.
Backstop: Zwei sehr hohe Backstops sind nötig um die angrenzenden Gebäude hinter den jeweiligen Homeplates zu schützen. Dies sollte an sich kein Problem sein, doch wir haben vor kurzem erfahren, dass die Fundamente sehr tief (und somit sehr teuer) sein müssen da der Baugrund zu sandig ist.


Nebensachen
Aschebahn und ""Pitcher's Mound"": Da neue Asche ziemlich teuer ist, haben wir uns dazu entschieden alte Tennisasche zu recyceln. Da Tennisplätze jeden Frühling ihre Asche erneuern kann man diese günstig erwerben. Im Moment planen wir, nur kleine Aschefelder um die Bases und Home Plate herum anzulegen, aber mit Ihrer Hilfe könnten wir richtige Aschebahnen zwischen den Bases bauen.
Dugouts: Die größten kosten beim Bau der Dugoutsn liegen bei dem Baugutachten, der Bauzulassung und den Betonfundamenten. Die Dugouts selbst werden aus jeglichen gespendeten Materialien gebaut, damit wir den Spielern so schnell wie möglich Unterschlupf vor dem Regen bieten können.
Geräteschuppen: Wir versuchen ein oder zwei gebrauchte Container aufzutreiben damit wir dort unsere Garten-, Wartungs- und Trainingsgeräte unterbringen können.
Außerhalb des Platzes: Der Platz ist auf allen Seiten von ungepflegten Dornenbüschen und Unkraut umgeben. Wir haben vor jegliches Unkraut und Baumstumpfe zu entfernen und stattdessen Gras dort zu pflanzen, damit jeder der sich unsere Spiele angucken möchte auch einen Platz zum sitzen findet.


Der Traum
Zur Zeit spielen fünf Baseball und Softball Teams jedes Alters und Geschlechts bei den Duisburg Dockers. Wir hoffen, dass da dieser speziell angefertigte Platz mehr Aufmerksamkeit auf diese tolle Sportart zieht und wir somit neue Spieler für uns begeistern können. Wir interessieren uns im Moment sehr dafür, zwei neue T-Ball Teams zu gründen, in dem auch die Kleinsten in Duisburg spielen können!

Ein bisschen zur Geschichte
Die Baseball und Softball Teams des 1. ASC Duisburg Dockers spielen schon seit sehr langer Zeit auf dem alten Fußballplatz im Schwelgernstadion, welcher heute hauptsächlich als American Football Platz genutzt wird. Die Wiese ist stark abgenutzt und zu sagen der Boden ist uneben wäre eine Untertreibung. Die lange, schmale Form des Platzes und die umgebende Aschelaufbahn tragen auch nicht wirklich zu unserem Nutzen bei.
Wir haben schon vor Jahren die Suche nach einem neuen Platz begonnen. Das größte Problem ist dass Duisburg mitten im Ruhrgebiet liegt und die Bevölkerungsdichte hier die höchste in Europa ist. Es gibt nur wenige große, offene Flächen, die man sich leisten kann, und in der Geschichte des Baseballs und Softballs in NRW mussten viele Vereine deswegen ihre Sachen packen und umziehen oder ganz aufhören. Erst letztes Jahr haben wir endlich den unbenutzten Fußballplatz ergattern können, was uns große Freude brachte (und immer noch bringt!).
Wir haben sofort mit den Baumaßnahmen begonnen.
Was wurde bisher erreicht?

Als allererstes wurde das Feld innerhalb des Geländers gepflügt, geebnet und letztes Jahr mit neuem Gras bepflanzt
Von der Stadt vorgegebene Bodenstudien, die für die Bauerlaubnis der Backstops und Dugouts nötigt sind, wurden durchgeführt.
Die Brombeerbüsche wurden 2012 über Wochen von Freiwilligen aus den verschiedenen Teams aus dem Boden gerissen, klein gehäckselt und wieder über die Erde zerstreut. Damit ist die Arbeit dort aber leider nicht getan, da immer wieder neues Unkraut (besonders Brennnessel) dort wächst. Deswegen müssen wir diese Bereiche so schnell es geht mit Gras bepflanzen.
Über die Duisburg Dockers
Der 1. American Sports Club Duisburg Dockers wurde 1986 als American Football Team gegründet. Bis zum heutigen Tage ist der Verein stetig gewachsen und beinhaltet heute American Football, Flag Football, Cheerleading, Baseball, Softball und seit Februar 2013 Wrestling.
Die Baseball und Softball Abteilung ist Teil des BSVNRW (Baseball & Softball Verband Nordrhein-Westfalen) und beinhaltet im Moment drei Baseball Teams (Jugend, Junioren und Herren) und zwei Softball Teams (Damen und ein gemischtes Freizeitteam).
 
 

What we are trying to do
In short: we are trying to build the first and only dual baseball & softball field in Duisburg. Work has already started on an old football pitch in Duisburg-Neumühl, and we are now raising funds to finance and complete some of the basic elements for these fields. If the target is reached, we should be able finish working on the field by June 2013, which in turn means that people can enjoy the second half of the Summer playing on it.
Any funds collected will go directly towards the following structures and facilities:

Essential:
Fencing around the fields: the field is almost completely surrounded by a handrail, which we will cover with wire mesh fencing to enclose the playing surface.
Backstop: two high backstops are necessary, as there are some industrial and commercial buildings behind where both homeplates will go. This should be simple enough, but we recently received bad news from the building consultant that the foundations will have to be very deep (and therefore expensive) because the soil is too sandy.


Non-essential:
Dirt tracks and pitching mound: New clay is prohibitively expensive in Germany, so it was decided that we will recycle tennis clay for this purpose. Luckily enough, tennis clubs redo their courts every spring. We have planned for dirt areas around the bases and home plate, but with your help, we might be able to do a whole infield track.
Dugouts: the bulk of the funds for dugouts will go to building inspectors, building permits, and pouring a concrete foundation. The dugouts themselves will be built out whatever donated materials we can get our hands on, so we can keep players out of the rain as soon as we can.
Equipment container(s): we are looking to obtain one or two used containers to store gardening, maintenance, and training equipment.
Around the field: the field is surrounded on 4 sides by unkept, bushy, poison-nettle infested areas. The idea is to remove the unwanted greenery and the tree stumps. Then resow with grass, so that people that would want to watch a game, have actually somewhere to sit on.



The vision
Currently 5 baseball and softball teams of all genders and ages play as Duisburg Dockers. We hope a purpose-built field will attract more attention to these amazing sports, as well as get some new members for the teams. We are especially interested in starting two new t-ball teams for the smallest kids in Duisburg!
The world needs more baseball!
A bit of history
For a very long time, the baseball and softball teams of the 1. ASC Duisburg Dockers have been playing on an old football pitch in the Schwelgernstadion, which is primarily now used as an American Football field. The grass is severely worn, and the ground is uneven to say the least. The shape of the pitch and the running track surrounding it are unhelpful at best.
For years the search for a suitable surface went on. The main difficulty being that Duisburg was smack in the middle of the Ruhr Area, the highest populated urban area in Europe. Affordable, large open spaces, are really hard to come by, and throughout the history of baseball and softball in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, many teams had to fold or relocate because of this. Only last year did we finally get the abandoned soccer pitch. We were (and still are!) extatic about this.
Work on it began right away.


What has been done so far?

First and most importantly, the field within the handrails was ploughed, evened and suitable grass was sown last year. 
Soil studies were conducted by an inspector, as required by the city, in order to obtain the building permits for the backstops and the dugouts.
The bushes surrounding the field were disposed off over weeks in 2012 by volunteers of the different teams. This work is ongoing, as the weeds, especially the poison nettle, always come back. This is why we need to put grass there ASAP.



About the Duisburg Dockers
The 1. American Sports Club Duisburg Dockers started in 1986 as an American Football team. To this day, the club has expanded itself and now includes American Football, Flag Football, Cheerleading, Baseball, Softball, and since February 2013, Wrestling.

Once a remote, bustling naval air station in Alaska's Aleutian island chain, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adak,_Alaska"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adak</a> is now nearly deserted compared to its historical population. It's part of a rich and picturesque wildlife refuge, a birder's paradise, an important part of military history, and an absolute gem that's nearly disconnected from the rest of civilization. I was born on Adak in 1985, where my father worked on the<a href=""http://alaskamaritime.fws.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge</a>. We moved away when I was three, but the distant memories, stories from my parents, and photos of being born in such a unique, isolated place stay with me to this day.

With a successfully funded project, I plan to travel to my birthplace this August and explore both the town and the island as it exists today. I'll travel as much of the island as possible while I'm there, photographing and journaling my experience the entire time.

<h1><strong>The Book and Photos</strong></h1>
<p>Given the military base shutdown in the mid 1990s and limited inhabitants and visitors since then, Adak has had very few quality photographs published since the invention of the modern digital camera. I aim to change that. The full-color book will be part photo essay and part story of the return to my birthplace. What I find and the emotions I feel when I visit will ultimately determine the book's contents, but I guarantee that it will be inspired and truly from the heart. I'll strive to discover and document what the island means to me, and what it can mean to you. My parents are also skilled photographers, and using their historical photography to contrast what the island was and my photography of what it is today will be a core part of the book.</p>

<h1><strong>The Funds</strong></h1>
<p>If I reach my funding goal, the funds raised will make the trip a reality and allow me to *almost* break even on the project by covering travel and printing costs for the resulting book and related materials.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Hi! My name is Amy Delilah Leon and I am 19 years old!</span></h3>
<p>I am currently studying Experimental Theatre at NYU.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> Ok, so heres the deal! I love life so much. I think this world and everything that occupies it is so incredibly beautiful. I have been through a lot in my 19 years. I have lived in many homes, many boroughs, I've called many people family. I was adopted when I was 13 and changed my name. I have most definitely developed a unique appreciation for life that I am proud of. But heres the thing, I don't remember anything before the age of 13. I don't know if that is normal or not but the fact that I look at my life and cannot remember more than half of it frightens me. I only know what has happened in the last 6 years. When I realized this I started journaling everyday writing down every single detail I could, I became the annoying friend who took pictures at every event, and not just a few but hundreds of pictures at the silliest events. None of them were award winning, or worth hanging up in a frame but each and everyone holds a memory. </p>
<p>  I was recently given 2 suitcases with pictures of my childhood in it from my birth mother. In it were hundreds of pictures of moments I don't remember. But I looked happy. Whenever I look back on my time with my birth mother I always see darkness and unhappiness because I guess it is easier to remember the tears we've cried than the laughs we've shared. But when looking through the photos there were laughs that I shared with my mother that I never knew existed. It was as if she gave me back my childhood that was so mercilessly stolen from me. Looking at them didn't make me remember anything but it ensured me that my childhood did in fact exist. </p>
<p>                                          SO FINALLY THIS IS WHY I'M DOING THIS!</p>
<p>I want to raise money to buy a camera! After years of taking pictures I became a bit good at it and I really want to further my craft when it comes to photography. But more than anything I want to capture my life now so that when I am 30 I can look back and remember the life I have led. I truly hope this memory thing isn't clinical (maybe I should get it checked out?) but if I do forget I will not worry because, well I will have thousands of beautiful pictures to remind me of my journey and all the people who have influenced me.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I also am not simply getting this camera simply because I want a fancy camera but I do plan on taking photography courses at NYU and they sorta require fancy cameras haha :)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>I believe that having the ability to capture lifes moments will only further my creativity. It will most definitely affect my writing and therefore affect the message I give to people. I write poetry, like a lot of poetry and i think looking at life through a lens may directly inform the way my mind meets the paper.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I also think that everything and everyone is beautiful. Hopefully my photographs (and hey maybe films!) will capture that beauty and inspire others to see the way I do.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If this doesn't all work out I mean it will totally be fine. I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. But I would very much like this support because I most definitely cannot do it on my own. NYU pshh is hella expensive even with a scholarship so I can't do this alone. But I know the Lord will provide.</p>

<p><strong>Dear friends and strangers,</strong></p> <p>Thank you for finding and taking time with this project. My name is Ieva Raudsepa and I’m an artist from Riga, Latvia, currently doing my MFA at California Institute of the Arts, based in Los Angeles. Together with Milda Books, a new publishing initiative focusing on artists from the Baltics, I want to publish my book <i>Cruise</i>.</p> <p><strong>Cruise</strong></p>
<p><i>Cruise</i> is a story about coming of age in which a ferry that goes between Riga and Stockholm becomes a metaphor for the transitional space between being a teenager and becoming an adult. Young people love it, as tickets are cheap and it's a good way to get away from their parents' sight and just let themselves go. The ferry provides all kinds of amusement—karaoke, an evening show with a flamboyant dance performance, gambling halls, a daily lottery, and a disco hall. ​The entertainment is sort of cliché and sometimes even absurd but, through its banality, the awkwardness of what it means to be human can appear.</p> <p>Youth is a fleeting phenomenon that is both painful and beautiful, and so is the contrast between the trashy interior of the ferry juxtaposed with the beauty of the sea. Trips on the ferry evoke a sort of nostalgia for the present that will soon be past—the sea surrounding the party is magnificent, but it is also this vast nothingness, ready to just swallow us up.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need your support?</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is a pre-sale of the book that will cover the production costs of the book (from the design of it to printing and binding it) and shipping. All of us have previous experience working with photography books, both on an artistic and production level (printing, binding, and distribution). We're confident that our combined knowledge and skills will result in a quality book. We have already worked with Green Print, a print house in Latvia offering high quality offset and digital printing, which will produce the book, and will be visiting festivals and book fairs to increase the visibility of the project after its launch.</p>
<p>We are planning for a production of 500 copies of the book. The main expenses are estimated at $6,600 on production, $3000 on shipping &amp; packaging (we've included the cost of shipping within the pledge you make), $3000 on design. Indiegogo's platform fee on all funds raised is 5%. </p>
<p>In addition to the pre-sale, I have made a series of Riso prints with some images from <i>Cruise</i>. Their sale will also contribute to covering the costs of production of the book. The prints are 28 x 43 cm (11 x 17 inches). They are based on sea landscapes from the project, and because of the two-color Riso printing, each of them is a unique piece. The prints will be shipped from Los Angeles within a 3 business days after purchase.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>By contributing to our cause, you will be helping to make <em>_____ is dead</em>, our BFA thesis exhibition, a reality. The exhibiton will be held in Seigfred Gallery at Ohio University, April 9-13. Featured artists include Claire Cushing, Bo Hoffman, Nettie McGee, Carrie Mitchell, and Andrea Pierson. While each artist's work deals with a different subject, we have all focused on the central theme of death. in many cases, this is not a literal interpretation of death, but rather an effort to kill the previously held notions about the topic, and reinvent it. The subjects we work with range from an investigation of abandoned landscapes once inhabited by people, to the mask of masculinity and the true nature of male emotions, to a defamilarization of the body, to an exploration of the semiotics of sex and sexuality, and even a venture into morbidity with close look at death itself.</p>

<p><span><b>JARED’S BIOGRAPHY</b></span></p>
<p>Jared has worked in war torn and impoverished countries. He has been widely published, and was Director of Photography on the HBO series Witness. While he is mostly known for his photography, he is a humanitarian first. An advocate for human rights at all cost. Jared has skillfully and creatively used his art of photography and cinematography to capture human suffering in its purest form. He has risked his life, time and time again, to tell stories. He has traveled the world, and through his evocative images given voice to people who have been silenced. It is important that he is recognized as a man who has strength of heart. A courageous man, a nonconformist who refuses to accept the status quo and takes risk for the greater good. He has witnessed the fragility of our existence in many contexts and now the reality of his own fragility is before him.</p>
<br/>Please see Jared's work and reel at <a href=""http://www.jaredmoossy.com./"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jaredmoossy.com.</a><br/><p></p>
<p><span><b><br/></b></span></p>
<p><span><b>WE NEED YOUR HELP</b></span></p>
<p>In the face of a difficult situation, we must remember the stories of the individuals. We must focus on these narratives to understand and appreciate the value of each and every human life. Jared is not merely a victim of a careless act. He is a fighter, and as his family we have a grave responsibility to tell his empowering story in way that will make him proud. We hope to shine a light on the terrible and destructive effects of Drunk Driving, and to encourage safer practices. The world needs more artists, more humanitarians, more Jared Moossy's, and less carelessness.</p>

JARED’S BIOGRAPHY
Jared has worked in war torn and impoverished countries. He has been widely published, and was Director of Photography on the HBO series Witness. While he is mostly known for his photography, he is a humanitarian first. An advocate for human rights at all cost. Jared has skillfully and creatively used his art of photography and cinematography to capture human suffering in its purest form. He has risked his life, time and time again, to tell stories. He has traveled the world, and through his evocative images given voice to people who have been silenced. It is important that he is recognized as a man who has strength of heart. A courageous man, a nonconformist who refuses to accept the status quo and takes risk for the greater good. He has witnessed the fragility of our existence in many contexts and now the reality of his own fragility is before him.
Please see Jared's work and reel at www.jaredmoossy.com.

WE NEED YOUR HELP
In the face of a difficult situation, we must remember the stories of the individuals. We must focus on these narratives to understand and appreciate the value of each and every human life. Jared is not merely a victim of a careless act. He is a fighter, and as his family we have a grave responsibility to tell his empowering story in way that will make him proud. We hope to shine a light on the terrible and destructive effects of Drunk Driving, and to encourage safer practices. The world needs more artists, more humanitarians, more Jared Moossy's, and less carelessness.

I am starting my first year of school, and with that all of my money saved is going towards other school supplies.

From engineering to culinary, literally hundreds and dozens of courses your ""O"" level score could get you.But what, where and how would a teen of 17 or 18, at that age, come to choose a course that would no lesser, come to define who he or she would be in 4 years time?I was in that crowd. No, i was not that kid who always owned a stethoscope and had a natural-born immunity for blood and wanted to a doctor for the rest of his life.I was clueless.I was just that fat kid who was deeply infatuated with The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring, when it came in 2001. There, something about movies sparked inside of me.But i knew, that i've always wanted to be somewhere in the media and arts line.Writing, narrating, filming, singing.Basically being a person who would express oneself only for the benefit of him and him alone, while the only perks were if others liked it.So i applied for Mass Communication, despite be 2 points short of its cut-off point.They called me in for an interview. So i went.There was i, dressed more or less appropriately.Across from me in the waiting room, was a dude, probably same aged, but i see he was carrying a portfolio, and god was it humongous.

<h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
<p>I am a photographer from the Netherlands, graduated from the Acadamy of Arts in 1997, being a documentary photographer since then. Capturing life of minorities and subcultures with a special interest in Roma and Sinti.</p>
<p>Since 2005 i visit  and photograph life of the Romani people in Europe on a very regular base. Every minute amongst Roma i am surprised by their behavior, humor, rythm and passion.</p>
<p>This largest minority of Europe ( 10 to 12 million ) lives a remarkable life. Centuries ago they migrated from Punjab and Radjastan toward the West. Beartamers, storytellers, tinmakers and horsetraders lived a tough life. Strangely enough, in 2013 it still is.</p>
<p>I would like to achieve more awareness of the unique situation of Roma all over the world. By means of photography i give a personal image of life of this amazing minority without a king or a president, with no land and no borders. But with pride, religion, tradition and lots of humor. By creating a photobook and exhibiting the works i intend to built awareness for the life of Roma and Sinti.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The book</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The photobook shows 200 photo's and tells 10 personal stories.</p>
<p>To get the book designed,printed and internationally published I need 22000 euro. In return I will offer you artist's prints of wonderful people,  beautiful photo's, a signed book of course. A photoshoot when you live in Europe or when able to visit the Netherlands. Or i will visit you in your country and we make a good and creative deal.</p>
<p>If i do not reach the entire goal the funds will go to Roma villages where i will give photography lessons at Roma schools and create workshops with creative collegues. I realised these projects before  and the Roma children as well as their parents were very excited about the projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Important: For Dutch people i get my book crowdfunded as well and at thjis very moment (july 25) i received almost 10.000 euro!</p>
<p>Wanna have a look? Feel free. it's in Dutch though.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: arial;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">My name is Julayne Farmer. I am a graduate of the San Francisco Art Institute in California</span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;""> and I am initiating a program called Follow Your Art. This is a participatory photographic program which provides visual literacy instruction to under-served children around the world. It is my belief that teaching photographic technique and creative writing to these children will help them identify, represent, and enhance their health, communities, and lives. This program will provide the tools that foster self-awareness, conscience, independent thinking, and creative imagination. By encouraging the children to be surveyors of their communities and world, I am also encouraging them to take a journey inward, toward self-discovery as authors and artists of their own life stories. The articulate voices produced from this work will give these individuals new vision, new possibilities, a wider range of life choices, ways to respond to life and to change the world. Please see more about Follow Your Art's previous initiatives at our website: </span></span> <a href=""http://www.photo-literacy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.photo-literacy.com</a><span style=""font-family: arial;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">. In addition to raising funding for the project on Indiegogo, I am also selling prints of both my own work and the children's work at </span></span><a href=""http://www.bluemelon.com/julayne81"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bluemelon.com/julayne81</a>. 88% of the money raised from the selling of these prints will go to benefit the Follow Your Art initiative in Nepal and Northern India (as ""bluemelon.com"" procures 12% for hosting the images on their website).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial;""><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">With Follow Your Art, I hope to set into affect positive social change through providing photographic tools and training to the children in these communities. </span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The program will provide a stage for these participating groups to both exhibit and market their work and to motivate change in their communities and around the world. Through my past personal experiences in working with these children across the globe, the real consequence of not having a program like this one is that many of the children in these under-served countries are never shown a way to give voice to their concerns, dreams and hopes for the future. This program gives the youth - especially those who feel silenced by their elders, their religion, their culture, etc. - </span><span style=""font-size: 11pt;"">a unique voice through which to initiate and activate change.</span></span></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial;"">I have raised money, in the past, for two Follow Your Art program initiatives: The first one was at a not for profit children's hospital in Siem Reap, Cambodia in 2006. The second initiative was in a remote primary/secondary school in Shey village, Ladakh, India in 2009. I needed money to implement this program into these facilities and I am again in need of money to fund this next venture into both a school in northern India and in a children's orphanage in Nepal by October 2012. By donating to this cause, you will be helping to offset the costs of travel expenses and creative materials. I am trying to raise $4,000 to help lay the foundation for this particular project.</span></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please pass this on to anyone who might have even the slightest interest in youth empowerment, international cultures, childhood education, Nepal, India, art, photography, or even me, Julayne Farmer.  ""Like"" the project on Facebook and share with as many people as possible. It's important that we get this done and I can't do it without you!</p>

This program will provide the tools that foster self-awareness, conscience, independent thinking, and creative imagination. By encouraging the children to be surveyors of their communities and world, I am also encouraging them to take a journey inward, toward self-discovery as authors and artists of their own life stories. The articulate voices produced from this work will give these individuals new vision, new possibilities, a wider range of life choices, ways to respond to life and to change the world. Please see more about Follow Your Art's previous initiatives at our website:  http://www.photo-literacy.com. In addition to raising funding for the project on Indiegogo, I am also selling prints of both my own work and the children's work at http://www.bluemelon.com/julayne81. 88% of the money raised from the selling of these prints will go to benefit the Follow Your Art initiative in Nepal and Northern India (as ""bluemelon.com"" procures 12% for hosting the images on their website).
 
 


The Impact
With Follow Your Art, I hope to set into affect positive social change through providing photographic tools and training to the children in these communities. The program will provide a stage for these participating groups to both exhibit and market their work and to motivate change in their communities and around the world. Through my past personal experiences in working with these children across the globe, the real consequence of not having a program like this one is that many of the children in these under-served countries are never shown a way to give voice to their concerns, dreams and hopes for the future. This program gives the youth - especially those who feel silenced by their elders, their religion, their culture, etc. - a unique voice through which to initiate and activate change.
 


What We Need & What You Get
I have raised money, in the past, for two Follow Your Art program initiatives: The first one was at a not for profit children's hospital in Siem Reap, Cambodia in 2006. The second initiative was in a remote primary/secondary school in Shey village, Ladakh, India in 2009. I needed money to implement this program into these facilities and I am again in need of money to fund this next venture into both a school in northern India and in a children's orphanage in Nepal by October 2012. By donating to this cause, you will be helping to offset the costs of travel expenses and creative materials. I am trying to raise $4,000 to help lay the foundation for this particular project.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> My name is Victor Salvo. This is the story of how I became involved with The Macombre Christian Academy in Macombre, Haiti. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> It started in the October of 2010. I went to a TEDx event at The Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole on Cape Cod. There, amongst all the distinguished speakers, was the scientist William Mebane talking about fish farming in Haiti. In appreciation for his talk I sent Bill a photo I had taken of salmon farming in New Brunswick, Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> As things would have it, the day he emailed a thank you to me I was in Florida talking with two strangers that I had met at an outdoor concert (after they had grabbed me to lead their conga line at the Naples Botanical Garden). They had just returned from their home in Haiti where they had hosted the very same Mr. Mebane. And so I met Rick and Kathy Land who own a flat above the administrative building at the Macombre Christian Academy. Or what was the Academy prior to The Earthquake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Macombre Christian Academy is situated just outside of Leogane, a poor, rural town twenty miles west of Port-Au-Prince, facing the bay. The Academy is the pride of the community, educating 800 children from preschool through the  senior year of high school. Founder and educator Obinson Joseph started the Academy ten years ago after seeing a need for a better school in the largely agricultural area. His school soon became the best known and respected center of education in the Leogane Plain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> When the earthquake hit there were only Mr. Joseph and one employee in the building; thankfully, both survived. Within days the community came with steel bars and hammers (and even rocks) and began breaking down the huge cement walls and ceilings of the former two story building. Eventually, through local and international volunteers the land was cleared and a committment to rebuild was begun. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Using a blueprint provided by the University of Florida's College of Design, Construction and Planning an astonishing amount of reconstruction has since occured. The Evangelical Free Church of America swept in while I was there and built the forms for supporting the large, cracked cistern high up on fractured cement legs. Nonetheless, the kitchen, the cafeteria/meeting hall and the building for the older students, those who will be first to graduate from the Academy, have yet to be built. </p>
<p>   </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. When I went there to work I was told, ""Do not get hurt - there is no 911."" This country is in dire need of infrastructure, and education of the young is key to achieving that goal. Educating the nation's youth will create future leaders capable of moving their country forward in it's quest to modernize and stabilize. In essence, your contribution will help Haiti help itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Your contribution to tOUCH hAITI will enable me to return to Haiti to create a photography book documenting the progress of the effort to rebuild the Macombre Christian Academy. The book will help spread awareness of the plight of the Haitian people as well as the importance of the school to the region. My intent is for the book to generate contributions to the rebuilding effort. By generating interest in the school and its reconstruction, I am looking to have my photographic art pave the way to A STABLE NATION.</p>

<p>About this project</p>
<p>Damascus steel, Antikythera mechanism, data from Apollo and Gemini missions spacecrafts, mummification, Stradivarius' violin, Roman concrete, Greek fire, aunt Berta's Vorschmack recipe… civilization lost probably forever so many technologies and we can’t feel nothing but sincere regrets about it.  Photography is not an exception. It seems that the knowledge is still here, that it’s not too late… but people are passing away, old books and magazines are going to a dumpster, and we are chasing a number of megapixels… </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479417416/ln1hekxebyhuannz02kj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We still can buy some analog photography chemicals but it looks like in a few years we will be able to use only 3 most popular premixed developers which we are going to order online. But fortunately some people out there are interested to study photography in-depth. People who do not balk at anything and who are ready to spend time and money for the benefit of the craft. </p>
<p>An analog photographer is like a medieval alchemist in a search for the Philosopher’s Stone to turn things into the gold – beautiful photo prints. Photographic Alchemy is an exercise in controlled chaos and a study in the science of art. By breaking down silver salts and celluloid to their elemental form, we are creating new reflections of our world. Sometimes dark and gritty and sometimes bright and soft. World seems to be emerging and dissolving right before our eyes. Toxic and fascinating, each new roll of film leaves us intrigued. And we just can’t wait to try the next substance on this ever increasing list.</p>
<p> It’s always out there - something we don’t know, something new to discover… It’s highly unlikely that one person will be able to use all formulas from this book during one lifetime. But it’s not the goal. We hope this publication will help you put your best foot forward, that every reader can find here many formulas to achieve their creative goals in photography.</p>
<p>What we want to make</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479417442/tlxd1iygs8zfhpit6is8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A nice comprehensive formulary today is a rare find. We have to hunt them down in antique stores and eBay. And some can be found only in archives or libraries. We decided to create the fullest and the most comprehensive book in the last two hundred years with all the formulas for photo chemicals. We want to bring back to life all forgotten recipes and formulas in one book. Today analog photography is going through the resurging phase and such book can become the biggest aid for anybody who is looking to create unique “authentic” prints.</p>
<p>The book will include all the recipes for film developers, photo paper developers, fixers and toners. <br/>Classic process of the following companies: Ansco, Dassonville, Defender, Du Pont, Kodak, Haloid, Agfa, Ilford and others . </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479417465/nzrvg6fvxk94oifbpjmw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition, there will be alternative processes such as: <br/>Albertype - a picture printed from a kind of gelatine plate produced by means of a photographic negative bromoil process, an early twentieth century process which begins with a silver bromide print and ends with an oily or inked print of alluring elegance; <br/>Calotype - the first process to utilize sodium thiosulfate as a permanent fixer for the image;<br/>Cyanotype, also known as a blueprint, that is considered among the easiest of all the historical methods;<br/>And other methods like vesicular process, heliotype, daguerreotype, calvar process, collodion process, and artotype. </p>

We learned from the best and gathered formulas from very old books (the oldest one goes back to 1866), magazines, and handwritten notes of real professionals.

It’s time to join forces, to preserve this unique knowledge for our fellow photographers today and those in the future.</p>
</div></div>","About this project
Damascus steel, Antikythera mechanism, data from Apollo and Gemini missions spacecrafts, mummification, Stradivarius' violin, Roman concrete, Greek fire, aunt Berta's Vorschmack recipe… civilization lost probably forever so many technologies and we can’t feel nothing but sincere regrets about it.  Photography is not an exception. It seems that the knowledge is still here, that it’s not too late… but people are passing away, old books and magazines are going to a dumpster, and we are chasing a number of megapixels… 

We still can buy some analog photography chemicals but it looks like in a few years we will be able to use only 3 most popular premixed developers which we are going to order online. But fortunately some people out there are interested to study photography in-depth. People who do not balk at anything and who are ready to spend time and money for the benefit of the craft. 
An analog photographer is like a medieval alchemist in a search for the Philosopher’s Stone to turn things into the gold – beautiful photo prints. Photographic Alchemy is an exercise in controlled chaos and a study in the science of art. By breaking down silver salts and celluloid to their elemental form, we are creating new reflections of our world. Sometimes dark and gritty and sometimes bright and soft. World seems to be emerging and dissolving right before our eyes. Toxic and fascinating, each new roll of film leaves us intrigued. And we just can’t wait to try the next substance on this ever increasing list.
 It’s always out there - something we don’t know, something new to discover… It’s highly unlikely that one person will be able to use all formulas from this book during one lifetime. But it’s not the goal. We hope this publication will help you put your best foot forward, that every reader can find here many formulas to achieve their creative goals in photography.
What we want to make

A nice comprehensive formulary today is a rare find. We have to hunt them down in antique stores and eBay. And some can be found only in archives or libraries. We decided to create the fullest and the most comprehensive book in the last two hundred years with all the formulas for photo chemicals. We want to bring back to life all forgotten recipes and formulas in one book. Today analog photography is going through the resurging phase and such book can become the biggest aid for anybody who is looking to create unique “authentic” prints.
The book will include all the recipes for film developers, photo paper developers, fixers and toners. Classic process of the following companies: Ansco, Dassonville, Defender, Du Pont, Kodak, Haloid, Agfa, Ilford and others . 

In addition, there will be alternative processes such as: Albertype - a picture printed from a kind of gelatine plate produced by means of a photographic negative bromoil process, an early twentieth century process which begins with a silver bromide print and ends with an oily or inked print of alluring elegance; Calotype - the first process to utilize sodium thiosulfate as a permanent fixer for the image;Cyanotype, also known as a blueprint, that is considered among the easiest of all the historical methods;And other methods like vesicular process, heliotype, daguerreotype, calvar process, collodion process, and artotype. 

Another unique section of the book is the Recipes from beyond the Iron Curtain. During the time when the East and the West were separated by political differences, both sides were developing some photography techniques in their own unique ways. Have a look at the formulas that were not accessible for decades.This book preserves very extensive information about all kind of photographic chemical formulas from the passed centuries and is currently work in progress. We have already the material for more than 300 pages and continue to add the information every day. We believe at the end it may be 500+ pages.

</div>
<p>It's a traditional dance that comes from the south Andean
region in Peru. Unlike most other dance forms in this region, which are
practiced by the whole community, Scissor Dance is only done by certain special
individuals, who had learned it since early age with an older master. These
dancers compete against each other in special ocations, as part of both the
christian and traditional Andean religious rites (which revere the forces of
nature). The competitions often include tests of courage, dexterity and resistance
to pain. The winners are decided either by a jury or by the favor of the
audience.</p>
<p>Where does it come from?</p>
<p>The origins of the dance itself are unclear. The
dancers, who decent from certain family lines, or inherit the art through a
master-student bond, identify themselves with the Taky Onqoy, a movement of
cultural resistance and rebellion that spread from the south Andes against the Spanish
colonizers during the XVI century. That movement announced the return of the
old gods, and their preachers were said to be possessed by them as they danced
in a strange unnatural fashion. Still today, Scissor Dancers talk about
""Five hundred years of cultural resistance"" when refereeing to
themselves and their tradition. The first written testimony of the dance as we
know it today comes along way later. In the year 1871 the local priest of
Corculla, a little town in the South Andes much alike many other towns, quotes
the testimony of a widow, who's late husband was a Scissor Dancer who made a
pact with the devil. The devil would teach him new dance moves and feats of
courage, and with them the dancer was able to beat his opponents in
competition. He was later found dead and dismembered in the outskirts of town.
Stories like this show the religious duality that the dance maintains to this
day. I one hand, they represent Andean culture; they pay tribute and sacrifices
to the earth and lakes, and take the name of the local ""Apus""
(mountain deities, who can transform into various kinds of animals), who were
regarded not so long ago as ""the devil"" by the Catholic Church. On
the other hand, the dance is performed very often in front of the churches and
in religious ocations, paying tribute to the local saints, to Jesus and to the
christian god, as most of the dancers, like most Peruvians, are christians
themselves.</p>

<p> In the most recent years, the tradition had
to adapt as history changed around it. Since the mid of the century, a process
of migration from the countryside to the urban areas has been taking place,
driving large colonies into the cities along with their traditions. This
process was accelerated during the 80s by a sanguinary war that hit in a
dramatic way the land of Ayacucho, one of the centers of Scissor Dance. There,
in the big cities, Andean musicians, dancers and artists clashed with a new
world of sounds and colors they didn't hesitate at making their own. Among the
changes that came to be, the rise of female Scissor Dancers is one of the most
notorious. This has been traditionally a male only activity and the appearance
of women dancers represent a special characteristic of Andean culture: that of
being in constant change and adaptation, that of keeping their traditions alive
by the act of defying them. The dance and the dancers, in their current state,
represent a culture that refuses to be kept frozen in time as a museum object,
and chooses to stay alive and moving.</p>

<p>Student Bonfire is a singular experience.  The Aggies who build it are equally unique.  And their commitment to Bonfire is year round.  This calendar will offer a look into Bonfire 2013, even as the students prepare for Bonfire 2014.  In large, brilliant photos accompanied by the stories behind them, you will follow a Bonfire's construction from Cut to Burn.</p><p>This calendar will be meant to help all of us show our support for Bonfire and its Aggies, rekindle a bit of the past, motivate, inspire, and keep everyone squared away in making plans for the next Bonfire in 2014.</p><p>Additionally, the calendar will feature important dates for the Good Ag, like Muster, campus events (as available), historical and significant Texas A&amp;M anniversaries and dates, and more. </p><p>As a former participant, leader, and Head Stack of the first Bonfire Stack off campus, and now as an adviser to the students, I am at home at Bonfire and among its participants.  <a href=""http://dion-c.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My view</a> is one informed by experience, and of deep respect and admiration.  I have been fortunate to enjoy an uncommon perspective, and I hope to share it with you here.</p><p>The students of Bonfire offer us all a valuable example of loyalty, pride, determination, in relentless pursuit of a stunning end product.  This is just a small tribute to them.</p><h3>Each month, an image fit to be framed</h3><p>Each month will feature an 8x12 photo of another moment in Bonfire 2013.  This is a non-standard size for a wall calendar.  But it will leave you with 13 separate photos (including the cover), each fit for framing at their original resolution.</p><p>The calendar will also include an extra page to ensure that each photo will have its own page.  No photo will be printed on the back of another, so when the month has passed, you can remove and frame each photo on its own.  The space from the extra page will then be used to highlight supporters of Bonfire and this calendar project. </p>
<h3>Making the calendar</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8329/8140695626_e4b79814e5_m.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Even now, while students progress through the 2013 Bonfire season, I am with them at every step <a href=""http://flickr.com/dion-c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">capturing photos and stories</a> from the Woods to Stack.  Throughout the calendar, stories and descriptions of the activities pictured will enrich the photos, making each a complete story for you to share.  Burn will complete the calendar, and within days, with the addition of that final photo, the calendar will go to press to be delivered in the first week of December.</p>
<p>For a calendar to be ready in December, the timing of Burn in late November presents a major challenge, but one that all parties are ready to meet.  Since 2009, I have designed and printed Bonfire's Burn Night t-shirts featuring the year's Last Shift photo taken only days before Burn.  From that experience, I am aware of and look forward to the challenge this project will present.</p>
<p>But for all the hours it will require from now until delivery, and for its sleepless stretch of days at the end, it will still hardly be a challenge at all when compared to what the students will have taken head-on and overcome.</p>
<h3>This campaign</h3>
<p>The project should and will reflect on Bonfire and its Aggies not just in its content, but in its careful planning, attention to detail, and end product.  To offer a meaningful product of worthy quality will require expense.  I have for years taken on much of the expense required to capture, compile, and share these photos.  I will continue to do so, regardless of the outcome of this campaign.</p>
<p>But this campaign, if successful, will make possible a wider audience for the Bonfire story.  It will keep fresh the memories of Bonfires past, and the anticipation for the next.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly will be the stories and conversations it inspires.  ""What is that?!""  ""That's Bonfire.  Let me tell you about it.""</p>
<h3>Pass it back</h3>
<p>Whether or not you can make a contribution, you can play a part in making this project a success.  Pass it back.</p>

Student Bonfire is a singular experience.  The Aggies who build it are equally unique.  And their commitment to Bonfire is year round.  This calendar will offer a look into Bonfire 2013, even as the students prepare for Bonfire 2014.  In large, brilliant photos accompanied by the stories behind them, you will follow a Bonfire's construction from Cut to Burn.This calendar will be meant to help all of us show our support for Bonfire and its Aggies, rekindle a bit of the past, motivate, inspire, and keep everyone squared away in making plans for the next Bonfire in 2014.Additionally, the calendar will feature important dates for the Good Ag, like Muster, campus events (as available), historical and significant Texas A&M anniversaries and dates, and more. As a former participant, leader, and Head Stack of the first Bonfire Stack off campus, and now as an adviser to the students, I am at home at Bonfire and among its participants.  My view is one informed by experience, and of deep respect and admiration.  I have been fortunate to enjoy an uncommon perspective, and I hope to share it with you here.The students of Bonfire offer us all a valuable example of loyalty, pride, determination, in relentless pursuit of a stunning end product.  This is just a small tribute to them.Each month, an image fit to be framedEach month will feature an 8x12 photo of another moment in Bonfire 2013.  This is a non-standard size for a wall calendar.  But it will leave you with 13 separate photos (including the cover), each fit for framing at their original resolution.The calendar will also include an extra page to ensure that each photo will have its own page.  No photo will be printed on the back of another, so when the month has passed, you can remove and frame each photo on its own.  The space from the extra page will then be used to highlight supporters of Bonfire and this calendar project. 
Making the calendar
Even now, while students progress through the 2013 Bonfire season, I am with them at every step capturing photos and stories from the Woods to Stack.  Throughout the calendar, stories and descriptions of the activities pictured will enrich the photos, making each a complete story for you to share.  Burn will complete the calendar, and within days, with the addition of that final photo, the calendar will go to press to be delivered in the first week of December.
For a calendar to be ready in December, the timing of Burn in late November presents a major challenge, but one that all parties are ready to meet.  Since 2009, I have designed and printed Bonfire's Burn Night t-shirts featuring the year's Last Shift photo taken only days before Burn.  From that experience, I am aware of and look forward to the challenge this project will present.
But for all the hours it will require from now until delivery, and for its sleepless stretch of days at the end, it will still hardly be a challenge at all when compared to what the students will have taken head-on and overcome.
This campaign
The project should and will reflect on Bonfire and its Aggies not just in its content, but in its careful planning, attention to detail, and end product.  To offer a meaningful product of worthy quality will require expense.  I have for years taken on much of the expense required to capture, compile, and share these photos.  I will continue to do so, regardless of the outcome of this campaign.
But this campaign, if successful, will make possible a wider audience for the Bonfire story.  It will keep fresh the memories of Bonfires past, and the anticipation for the next.
Perhaps most importantly will be the stories and conversations it inspires.  ""What is that?!""  ""That's Bonfire.  Let me tell you about it.""
Pass it back
Whether or not you can make a contribution, you can play a part in making this project a success.  Pass it back.

<p>There's a lot of amazing professional e-sports photographers out there, covering many events.</p>
<p>But while the number and size of e-sports events keep growing, tournament organizers and/or gaming websites do not always seem to be willing to hire those professionals photographers to provide us with memories from those events. </p>
<p>One such example was during the Alliance run at World Cyber Arena in December 2015. Being a big fan of the Swedes, I have tried to find professional looking pictures of their victory at WCA on Dota community websites, WCA's official website and so on...and couldn't find any (and probably never will ?). It seems that what could have been my -potentially - favorite esport picture of 2015 never existed.</p>
<p>I don't know the reasons for this, nor do I pretend to, I can only assume they're either budgetary (professional photographers of course deserve to be paid for their hard work and some tournaments might have a tight budget) or that some event organizers or e-sports teams do not think photography is a great media to help cover and promote what they work so hard on. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, as an e-sports fan, gamer and amateur digital photographer, I sometimes find this situation disappointing (e.g. the WCA coverage mentioned above). </p>
<p>It is a shame in my eyes if you think of how much everyone can benefit from good photographic work : the emotion it conveys, the memories it creates. </p>
<p><b>Photography is what keeps memories alive.</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Until a few months ago, I have never tried to mix my two passions, but I thought it'd be fun and interesting to try and do so. The purpose of the project is twofold : <br/></p>
<p>a) I'd like to travel to a few <b>e-sports events </b> during the coming year, preferably going to smaller events, or events that will not have enough money in 2016 to hire the services of a professional e-sport photographer, and offer them to do portrait and reportage photography work there, free of charge for the events organizer.</p>
<p>b)Another part of the project would be to try and contact e-sports teams or e-sport personalities (casters etc) and try to organize <b>portrait photo sessions</b> with them, in the style of my previous work <a href=""http://goo.gl/PQG6bo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://goo.gl/PQG6bo</a> . I have my own favorite list of personalities whom I really would love to take portraits of and those I will contact first (but I'll keep it secret for now ;d), </p>
<p>The project's intent is therefore not to improve the state of e-sport photography (I would be delirious to try and pretend doing this), but to offer more photography to the community, going to work at events that cannot afford to hire any established photographers this year and try and fill that gap. And by doing so, maybe help those organizers/esports teams/gaming news websites understand it is something they should absolutely spend more money on to promote their events, brands, teams, and so on in the close future...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why are you crowdfunding?</span><br/></p>
<p>For the reasons mentioned above : some tournaments in 2016 might not have the will or the money to spend on hiring an established e-sport photographer. This would be an easy way to provide them, and the community, with that service.</p>
<p>This being said, travelling to any of those events is expensive and, in order to do a proper job, I will also need to spend money on a couple of expensive lenses/camera, so.....</p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3><span>What will you do with the money?</span></h3>
<div>All the money will obviously be spent on the project. I am <b>not looking for a job</b> : I have one (I'm mentioning this because I have heard this before and this irritated me, this is not the purpose of the project at all). I'm <b>not trying to turn in a profit</b> either : I don't need to, nor is it the long term purpose of the project. The purpose is to mix my two passions, gaming and photography, and do my best trying to take great pictures while doing it.  All the money gathered will be spent trying to do this. But I also would like to have my expenses covered while doing it. </div>
<br/><p><b>Lenses and camera</b>: The 5D I own works well in an environment where I can control the lightning and be very close to my subject, but reportage in an e-sports arena will require something totally different (more isos, faster focus, etc). I probably can get one great camera and one or two lenses for 4k euros (new is better, second-hand if budget is tight). </p>
<br/><p><b>Travelling costs</b>: I live in Belgium right now therefore I would focus on events that take place in Europe (and preferably central/northern Europe as they're easier to reach) in order to minimize travelling costs. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Entrance tickets to the events, car rental (I'd drive if I can avoid flying), fuel, hotels, food would probably amount to a minimum of 750-1000 euros per event. Different events will have different costs, but the more money I can gather, the more/better events I'll be able to cover.</span><br/></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Website and paypal fees:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> roughly 10 percent of the project.</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<b>Taxes : </b>I live in Belgium, there will be taxes, and probably heavy ones as we are pretty good in this category. I'll have to check how much they will amount to. I will do that once the project has been launched as I'll probably have to consult an tax advisor.</div><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Contributor rewards: </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">books, postcards, and so on. </span><br/>
</div><div>
<p>So all in all, my estimate is that 10K Euros should allow me to attend 3 or 4 events minimum (transport, housing, food, etc), buy the gear I would need to do a proper job, while covering all the other costs detailed above.</p>
<div>And of course, more money means more events/better gear, more chance to get good pictures and so on. And the other way around. <p></p>

There's a lot of amazing professional e-sports photographers out there, covering many events.
But while the number and size of e-sports events keep growing, tournament organizers and/or gaming websites do not always seem to be willing to hire those professionals photographers to provide us with memories from those events. 
One such example was during the Alliance run at World Cyber Arena in December 2015. Being a big fan of the Swedes, I have tried to find professional looking pictures of their victory at WCA on Dota community websites, WCA's official website and so on...and couldn't find any (and probably never will ?). It seems that what could have been my -potentially - favorite esport picture of 2015 never existed.
I don't know the reasons for this, nor do I pretend to, I can only assume they're either budgetary (professional photographers of course deserve to be paid for their hard work and some tournaments might have a tight budget) or that some event organizers or e-sports teams do not think photography is a great media to help cover and promote what they work so hard on. 
Whatever the reason may be, as an e-sports fan, gamer and amateur digital photographer, I sometimes find this situation disappointing (e.g. the WCA coverage mentioned above). 
It is a shame in my eyes if you think of how much everyone can benefit from good photographic work : the emotion it conveys, the memories it creates. 
Photography is what keeps memories alive.



Who are you?


My Name is David Van Elslande, I'm 40 year old guy and my main two hobbies are photography and gaming. 
Photography:  Some of my work can be seen here https://500px.com/davidvanelslande 




Gaming: I  played my first computer game about 30 years ago (played Frogger the year it came out, that's how old I am!), got instantly hooked, and I've been gaming ever since.  If I should list the top three games I've played  most during the past 10 years, it would probably be Unreal Tournament 2004, Starcraft 2 and Dota 2. 

What is this project about ?

Until a few months ago, I have never tried to mix my two passions, but I thought it'd be fun and interesting to try and do so. The purpose of the project is twofold : 
a) I'd like to travel to a few e-sports events  during the coming year, preferably going to smaller events, or events that will not have enough money in 2016 to hire the services of a professional e-sport photographer, and offer them to do portrait and reportage photography work there, free of charge for the events organizer.
b)Another part of the project would be to try and contact e-sports teams or e-sport personalities (casters etc) and try to organize portrait photo sessions with them, in the style of my previous work http://goo.gl/PQG6bo . I have my own favorite list of personalities whom I really would love to take portraits of and those I will contact first (but I'll keep it secret for now ;d), 
The project's intent is therefore not to improve the state of e-sport photography (I would be delirious to try and pretend doing this), but to offer more photography to the community, going to work at events that cannot afford to hire any established photographers this year and try and fill that gap. And by doing so, maybe help those organizers/esports teams/gaming news websites understand it is something they should absolutely spend more money on to promote their events, brands, teams, and so on in the close future...


Why are you crowdfunding?
For the reasons mentioned above : some tournaments in 2016 might not have the will or the money to spend on hiring an established e-sport photographer. This would be an easy way to provide them, and the community, with that service.
This being said, travelling to any of those events is expensive and, in order to do a proper job, I will also need to spend money on a couple of expensive lenses/camera, so.....






What will you do with the money?
All the money will obviously be spent on the project. I am not looking for a job : I have one (I'm mentioning this because I have heard this before and this irritated me, this is not the purpose of the project at all). I'm not trying to turn in a profit either : I don't need to, nor is it the long term purpose of the project. The purpose is to mix my two passions, gaming and photography, and do my best trying to take great pictures while doing it.  All the money gathered will be spent trying to do this. But I also would like to have my expenses covered while doing it. 
Lenses and camera: The 5D I own works well in an environment where I can control the lightning and be very close to my subject, but reportage in an e-sports arena will require something totally different (more isos, faster focus, etc). I probably can get one great camera and one or two lenses for 4k euros (new is better, second-hand if budget is tight). 
Travelling costs: I live in Belgium right now therefore I would focus on events that take place in Europe (and preferably central/northern Europe as they're easier to reach) in order to minimize travelling costs. 
Entrance tickets to the events, car rental (I'd drive if I can avoid flying), fuel, hotels, food would probably amount to a minimum of 750-1000 euros per event. Different events will have different costs, but the more money I can gather, the more/better events I'll be able to cover.
Website and paypal fees: roughly 10 percent of the project.

Taxes : I live in Belgium, there will be taxes, and probably heavy ones as we are pretty good in this category. I'll have to check how much they will amount to. I will do that once the project has been launched as I'll probably have to consult an tax advisor.
Contributor rewards: books, postcards, and so on. 

So all in all, my estimate is that 10K Euros should allow me to attend 3 or 4 events minimum (transport, housing, food, etc), buy the gear I would need to do a proper job, while covering all the other costs detailed above.
And of course, more money means more events/better gear, more chance to get good pictures and so on. And the other way around. 

Risks?You don't like my work at all. It's hard to tell since I have so far no experience in e-sport photo. But I'm obviously very keen to learn about it. And I suggest you visit my galleries at http://eurekastreet.deviantart.com/gallery/ or https://500px.com/davidvanelslande and decide for yourself if you can trust me to do a good job at something slightly different, or not...What the gaming community gets :All the pictures worth showing will be edited/retouched by myself (which can be very time-consuming) and then of course I will post the pictures on gaming websites, forums etc. I'll also obviously will put the pictures on the project's blog : (https://esportphotography.wordpress.com/). And then there's the contributor perks!What have you already done to work toward your objective?Launching the project on this platform was the first step.The blog, twitter account and facebook pages have been created as well (see link section for details)The next steps, while the project is being funded, will be :a) To start promoting the projectb) To create a list of events to attend in 2016 Remarks:Thanks a lot for reading this far.

I will know exactly where and when early on in January and will update this when I find out. </p><p>Operation Smile is a non-profit medical charity that provides life changing surgeries in third world countries to both children and adults who have been born with facial deformities. This charity focuses primarily on cleft lips and cleft palates however they also have special mission sites focusing on helping burn victims. To date, Operation Smile operates in over 60 countries and has performed over 200,000 surgeries. </p><p>I first became involved in Operation Smile when I was a Sophomore in High School. During my senior year I was selected to go on my first mission as a student volunteer to Can Tho, Vietnam. This experience changed my life and from then on I knew that volunteering with these types of organizations would be an enormous part of my life. <br/><br/>I have recently been accepted to participate in the U-Voice program. This program is offered to college volunteers who are interested in participating in a medical mission. As a U-Voice journalist it will be my job to document the entire mission and collect stories from the patients, volunteers, and doctors.

I will know exactly where and when early on in January and will update this when I find out. Operation Smile is a non-profit medical charity that provides life changing surgeries in third world countries to both children and adults who have been born with facial deformities. This charity focuses primarily on cleft lips and cleft palates however they also have special mission sites focusing on helping burn victims. To date, Operation Smile operates in over 60 countries and has performed over 200,000 surgeries. I first became involved in Operation Smile when I was a Sophomore in High School. During my senior year I was selected to go on my first mission as a student volunteer to Can Tho, Vietnam. This experience changed my life and from then on I knew that volunteering with these types of organizations would be an enormous part of my life. I have recently been accepted to participate in the U-Voice program. This program is offered to college volunteers who are interested in participating in a medical mission. As a U-Voice journalist it will be my job to document the entire mission and collect stories from the patients, volunteers, and doctors. I will keep a blog where I post these stories and photos as well as video footage. After the mission these will all be sent to Operation Smile headquarters where they will be used to attract new supporters, donors and volunteers. I am currently attending the School of Visual Arts for a BFA in Photography and Photojournalism has always been at the top of my interests. I feel so incredibly lucky to have been chosen to go on a second mission and your donation will not only allow me to have an unforgettable experience that will enhance my future career, but you will also be helping an amazing organization.If you are interested in viewing my photographs from my first mission you can see them here;http://www.debra-reyes.com/#!vietnam/c1ec9and my first mission video;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=1130209745853&l=2538772131866530554Thank you!Debra Reyes",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

INTRO:
This May, Von Wong Photography plans to raise 5,000$ to support an international collaboration that would combine both the surreal vision of Von Wong with a variety of artists across Europe to create a series of inspirational and visually stunning photo and video portraits.

To help raise this small amount of money, we have turned to the help of IndieGoGo to help crowdfund this project...
 
This adventure begins on MAY 1ST in Brussels and ends on MAY 31ST in Barcelona!
 

 
THE PROJECT:
What I have always found exciting about photography is the ability to create worlds... worlds that exist only in my mind until they are brought to reality. Expand that to include a multitude of artists to collaborate with and suddenly those worlds begin to grow, expand and breathe... 
Now take that to the next level. 
Imagine artists that are not only talented and unique...but that have also managed, despite all odds, to have the courage to find and pursue their dreams. Wouldn't you be interested in hearing their story?
Together with my videographer Erwan Cloarec, we have hunted for a range of exceptionally talented artists ranging from emerging music bands, leather mask designers, pyro-techniciens to independent film makers and more that have a story to tell, not only on photo... but also on video. 
We want to tell those stories.
 
WHAT WE'LL GIVE:
A travel blog with details of our adventures… of the excitement that comes with planning a spontaneous creative road trip including short video clips and photos. We want you to travel with us and hope that our journey will inspire you to do the same with your passions. 
Additionally, we will be putting out weekly passionately exciting documentaries of the artists we encounter as well as informative Behind The Scenes footage on the photoshoot process. 
We're bringing you over 200 man hours of work to make this possible. Why? Because we can. But most importantly because we love what we do and we want to share that love and passion with you.

To us, this project is a challenge... a challenge to prove to the world that you don't have to follow the constraints that life imposes on you. That if you want, you can reach out and touch your dreams. It's never easy... to break away from the norm, to leave the safety of what's familiar and safe... and try something completely different but it can be done. 
Thank you all for your support. Without you, I wouldn't be here today.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Soy Jorge Panchoaga, fotógrafo y antropólogo colombiano. A lo largo de mi carrera, me he dado cuenta de que me interesa la construcción de redes y conocimientos que impulsen y empoderen a la fotografía y a los fotógrafos a nivel local y regional.

<p><strong>En el año 2010, en el marco de una labor que me había sido encomendada como fotógrafo, llegué a Nueva Venecia. Víctima de las fuertes lluvias, el pueblo que habita sobre el agua se había inundado, por encima de las tradicionales entradas del río Magdalena. Sin embargo y para sorpresa mía, que el río subiera un metro o casi dos por encima de los techos de tabla, resultaba motivo de festejo entre los habitantes del pueblo. Desde ese día, me propuse entender porque se festejaba la inundación con agua dulce de su pueblo, y porque la salinización que cíclicamente ocurre no los hacia tan felices. Durante ocho años he visitado Nueva Venecia y a los amigos y amigas que ahí hice, vi crecer y graduarse a varios niños, casarse a otros amigos y a algunas personas que retraté los acompañé en su sepelio años después. He seguido trabajando, intentando entender el agua, el río y la relación que como humanos construimos con estos cuerpos que nos traen vida y muerte. Y en ese trabajar constante y curioso he intentado entender como han convivido durante más de 150 años estos pobladores con un ambiente tan complejo y por qué insisten en vivir en medio del agua, donde lo que más escasea es que sea potable para el consumo diario. La máxima paradoja, rodeados de agua que no pueden consumir.</strong></p>
<p><i>In 2010, in the framework of an assignment as a photographer, I arrived to Nueva Venecia. Victim of the heavy rains, the town that lives on the water had flooded, over the traditional entrances of the Magdalena River. However, to my surprise, that the river rose a meter or almost two above the roofs of the table, was a reason for celebration among the villagers. From that day on, I decided to understand why the flood with fresh water of his people was celebrated, and because the salinization that cyclically happens does not make them so happy. For eight years I have visited Nueva Venecia and the friends I made there, I saw several children grow and graduate, marry other friends, and accompany some people who I had portrayed at their burial years later. I have continued working, trying to understand the water, the river and the relationship that we as humans build with these bodies that bring us life and death. And in that constant and curious work I have tried to understand how these people have lived for more than 150 years with such a complex environment and why they insist in the middle of the water, where what is most scarce is that it is safe for daily consumption. The maximum paradox, surrounded by water that can not consume.</i></p>

The rewards we have designed for you, have different and good purposes: the first one is that you can buy in presale and with a special price the DULCE Y SALADA book and be one of the first to have this publication. The second is to help several of these books reach the hands of New Venice residents, with this, both your book and the inhabitants of New Venice, will be even more economical. The third is that they can acquire other titles of my authorship at a special price. Finally, we have designed a special package for those who want to have a collectable edition of my work. In this package we include a 50x37 cm printed photo or a 50x70 cm photoserigraphy at a really special price and we will send it to anywhere in the world along with your book.
 


 
DULCE Y SALADA se encuentra listo para entrar a imprenta. Los apoyos que buscamos a partir de esta campaña, están destinados a pagar los gastos finales de impresión y están enfocados en hacer llegar el trabajo a más personas de Nueva Venecia. Creemos que compartiendo el trabajo realizado, aportamos en los procesos locales de empoderamiento, de trabajo comunitario y de fortalecimiento de redes colaborativas.
DULCE Y SALADA is ready to go to press. The supports that we seek from this campaign, are intended to pay the final printing costs and are focused on getting the work to more people in Nueva Venecia. We believe that by sharing the work done, we contribute to local processes of empowerment, community work and the strengthening of collaborative networks.

<h3>In Short</h3>
<p>I'm just a Russian girl who fell in love with figure skating a couple years ago and quickly discovered how much I loved taking photos at the events. Since then, I've been working hard to improve, visiting as many competitions as I can. I'm working on becoming an official press photographer so I can access even more events, have better angles and more opportunities to take photos. In the meantime, I need to upgrade my equipment, but all my funds are going towards travel expenses &amp; event tickets. This is where you come in!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536090439/vyaknqrlmrrjw7hjqvms.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Goal And Your Rewards</h3>
<p>My main goal for now is to upgrade to Canon f/2.8 70-200 IS. Currently I can regularly borrow a better body (Canon 5D) but not a lens that would allow me to take pictures of better quality. So that's my main priority!</p>
<p>This is how the funding is going to be distributed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm planning to buy a used lens which costs around 50k RUB (~740 USD).</li>
<li>Around 15k RUB (~220 USD) is what I'll need for printing the physical rewards.</li>
<li>Around 7k-8k RUB (104-120 USD) is going towards shipping.</li>
<li>About 5k RUB (~75 USD) + 25 USD (since I'm using a non-US bank account) will cover the platform fees</li>
</ul>
<p>As thanks for your contributions, I've prepared a range of rewards, including digital-only and physical! The highlights include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>figure skating calendars</strong> with my favourite photos from 2017-2018 season and the dates of the most important competitions coming up in 2019</li>
<li>two special calendars dedicated to my favourite skaters: Shoma Uno and Wakaba Higuchi, as well as an option for you to create your own, <strong>custom calendar</strong> made of any photos I have!*</li>
<li>your own special collection of photos of <strong>any skater or team</strong> participating at a competition I'm going to in 2018-2019 season (currently: Lombardia Trophy 2018, Grand Prix Helsinki 2018, Rostelecom Cup 2018, more tba)</li>
<li>10x15 <strong>photo cards</strong> with any photo of your choosing</li>
<li>and more :)</li>

<p>こんにちは！私はルダコヴァ ダリア (verit). このページを訪問していただきありがとうございます。</p>
<p>ロシアのフィギュアスケーティングの写真家です、さまざまなイベントへの旅を楽しみです、皆さんと写真をオンラインで共有しています。</p>
<p>私はより良くなり、正式な写真家になりたいです。 私のもう一つの目標は、より良い写真を撮るためにカメラレンズをアップグレードすることです。</p>

</div></div>","In Short
I'm just a Russian girl who fell in love with figure skating a couple years ago and quickly discovered how much I loved taking photos at the events. Since then, I've been working hard to improve, visiting as many competitions as I can. I'm working on becoming an official press photographer so I can access even more events, have better angles and more opportunities to take photos. In the meantime, I need to upgrade my equipment, but all my funds are going towards travel expenses & event tickets. This is where you come in!


My Goal And Your Rewards
My main goal for now is to upgrade to Canon f/2.8 70-200 IS. Currently I can regularly borrow a better body (Canon 5D) but not a lens that would allow me to take pictures of better quality. So that's my main priority!
This is how the funding is going to be distributed:

I'm planning to buy a used lens which costs around 50k RUB (~740 USD).
Around 15k RUB (~220 USD) is what I'll need for printing the physical rewards.
Around 7k-8k RUB (104-120 USD) is going towards shipping.
About 5k RUB (~75 USD) + 25 USD (since I'm using a non-US bank account) will cover the platform fees

As thanks for your contributions, I've prepared a range of rewards, including digital-only and physical! The highlights include:



figure skating calendars with my favourite photos from 2017-2018 season and the dates of the most important competitions coming up in 2019
two special calendars dedicated to my favourite skaters: Shoma Uno and Wakaba Higuchi, as well as an option for you to create your own, custom calendar made of any photos I have!*
your own special collection of photos of any skater or team participating at a competition I'm going to in 2018-2019 season (currently: Lombardia Trophy 2018, Grand Prix Helsinki 2018, Rostelecom Cup 2018, more tba)
10x15 photo cards with any photo of your choosing
and more :)

*Except for some photos from Lombardia Trophy 2017, since I've lost some of the original files from there. Please inquire for details.
Stretch Goals
In case I reach 1600$, I'll be able to buy Canon f/2.8 70-200 IS II! I will also send a photo card to every backer starting from 5$ (in which case I will require your mail address if you haven't provided one yet)!

After injuring his back and undergoing back surgery in 2006, he was medically discharged and began taking his hobby of photography more seriously. <br/><br/>Photography soon became a huge part of his life, and helped provide him with a sense of purpose and direction in his life after his unexpected injuries and discharge. He became very skilled in several genres of photography, including portraiture, fashion and modeling, commercial and advertizing, concerts, weddings, and artistic photography. To see some of his previous work, check out <a href=""http:www.brianparton.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.brianparton.com</a>.<br/><br/>Over the last few years however, a combination of factors have made continuing his passion much more difficult. His injuries worsened, and he underwent a knee surgery in 2011 and a second back surgery in May of this year. The economy tanked.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys! My name’s Jushin Gonzalez, and I'm a photographer based in Jersey City and have been shooting for almost four years now. When I began, my main focus was on landscapes and cityscapes, but it wasn't until a friend convinced me to photograph her that I found my passion. It amazed me how beauty can be captured in a single moment, and from there I was hooked. Since then, I've shot portraits because I love the many ways you can portray someone by a simple movement or change of gesture.</p>
<p>My campaign is called ""Poetry: The Brave and The Bold."" It's a lingerie photo-series of women of different shapes, sizes, and tones. I want women that lack confidence in their own bodies and other physical attributes to be able to identify with the women being featured in my series. I want them to think, ""Wow, this girl looks like me and she's beautiful--just like I am."" </p>
<p>Regardless of their physical attributes, throughout time, women have inspired some of the greatest poetry in existence based on the intangibles that inspired the writer. It was my love of comic books that inspired the title and the meaning behind ""The Brave and The Bold."" ""The Brave"" are the women who are hesitant to pose for this project but have bravely accepted the challenge. ""The Bold"" are the women who proudly pose for the project, most of whom overcame views of their self-image. Both The Brave and The Bold portray self-love. My hope with this project is to inspire body positivity and self-love.</p>
<p>In order to shoot this project, I need to raise enough money to rent out a studio. I have about three dozen models posing, and would like an hour of studio time each. As some of you may know, studio rentals are not cheap. Combined with the amount of models, it adds up to a lot monetarily. Another portion of the funds will go to obtaining prints of the models to put up in art gallery showings. I consider myself a perfectionist and would like to print on high-quality paper and proper framing. Also, as mentioned, I would love for this to be shown in art galleries which is another cost. I'd like to show this project in as many galleries as possible, which will also take up a portion of the funds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I set my goal at $3000 and will be broken down as such:</p>
<p>- $1,200 towards studio time</p>
<p>- $500 towards prints &amp; frames</p>
<p>- $1,000 toward gallery rentals &amp; promotionals</p>
<p>- $300 toward food for the 30+ models, Makeup Artists, &amp; everyone involved (I'm shooting this all in a span of 2 days)</p>
<p>The perks offered range from a 'thank you' in the pamphlet to various types of photoshoots throughout Hudson County. They will range from single person portraits, to multi person portraits, with as much creativity involved as you wish. The higher packages are ideal for entertainment groups, or even if you want to take cool pictures with your friends. All perks include a featured 'thank you' in the pamphlet when displayed at any art galleries.</p>
<p>This project will be shot regardless of whether or not I meet my goal. All of the money raised will go toward the project, and I'd have to pay the rest out of pocket. This may push it further back, but I'm so passionate about the message behind ""Beauty: The Brave and The Bold"", that I WILL shoot it despite any financial setbacks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project can be an inspiration to women who are battling low confidence and self-esteem from body negativity. I want them to know that they truly are beautiful, regardless of the media's beauty standards. The amount of bravery it will take for a lot of these women to pose in front of a camera in lingerie is very admirable. I want to throw away the notion that beauty is what the media says, so women of all types can embrace their existing beauty.</p>
<p>This is my most ambitious project to date, and one that I hold very close to heart. I have many female friends who don't think that they’re beautiful because they have cellulite, they don't measure the same as the women featured on tv and in magazines, or they don’t see women that look like them in positions of social influence. These women are some of the most beautiful women I know both inside and out. This project is dedicated to all my friends with these beliefs; I want them to be aware of the beauty they possess.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks on this project are high for me. I've sold some of my possessions to have some sort of budget to make this project happen. Also, I'm in between jobs, but when I accomplish all the goals for this project, everything will be worth it. The greatest risks are financial, but if it means that I can accomplish my dreams, then so be it. My challenges are getting the final project to take off. I can have it shown but I would like to market it better. Luckily, I have a very good friend who works in the the art industry who's going to help so much with the promotional things.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t donate money, that’s not a problem. Just spreading the word about this project and sharing my Indiegogo page helps out a lot. Any kind of support for my project, ""Poetry: The Brave &amp; The Bold"", is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>On the 17th December 2012 our new home based business opened to the public. Bella Leigha Hair, Beauty &amp; Photography Srudio.</p>
<p>This business is unique in the fact that we have combined a photography studio with hair &amp; beauty. All three services actually compliment each other quite well. Clients can come in and have their hair &amp; make-up done and if they so choose, can have a photo shoot or portait done before leaving the premises. Our clients love the concept and find it very <span>convenient too</span> We have been operating now for 6 months and have been steadily growing our client base from scratch. The feedback from our clients has been quite positive and inspiring. We love making our clients feel welcome &amp; happy.</p>
<p>However, our joy has been short lived with one of our neighbours complaining to our local council about us running this business from our home. The council has issued us with a show cause notice as to why they shouldn't close us down. When I contacted the council in October last year I was told I did not need any permits or neighbour consent/notifications and it was fine to continue with the project, now 6 months later they are saying I am in breech of the by-laws associated with running a home based business and even if I do apply for a permit there are no guarantees that they will approve the business being run from the house. This has been quite a blow to our dedicated team.</p>
<p>What makes us stand out from other hair salons is; the service we provide, our low prices, we are kid friendly &amp; we offer our clients affordable hair, beauty &amp; photography products and packages that no other salon can offer. Our friendly helpful staff make it a pleasurable experience for everyone. We even offer to mind babies while our customers get pampered as well (no one else offers this service), </p>
<p>We'd like to continue offering this unique service to new &amp; existing customers, so after discussing recent events with the staff, we all agreed that to grow the business further and to stop the council closing us down, we have to relocate the business to a suitable retail outlet. </p>
<p>To acheive this we need to find a suitable premises (which has been found), complete a shop fit-out,  advertise our new location and erect new signage. All of this requires a large amount of money, money that unfortunately I have already spent on the home based studio.</p>
<p>We need to purchase things like; work stations, wash basins, erect partition walls, paint walls in our theme colours, new flooring, plumbing and electrical work. Some furniture will be transfered to the new studio, however some items (like the wash basins &amp; work stations) can't be removed without breaking them so we need to purchase new ones.</p>
<p>We would like to ask you for your assistance in helping us relocate our unique business. Any amount of financial assistance would be greatly appreciated, but if you can't help us financially you can still assist us by spreading the word about our campaign, please use Indiegogo's share tools to help spread the word.</p>

</div></div>","On the 17th December 2012 our new home based business opened to the public. Bella Leigha Hair, Beauty & Photography Srudio.
This business is unique in the fact that we have combined a photography studio with hair & beauty. All three services actually compliment each other quite well. Clients can come in and have their hair & make-up done and if they so choose, can have a photo shoot or portait done before leaving the premises. Our clients love the concept and find it very convenient too We have been operating now for 6 months and have been steadily growing our client base from scratch. The feedback from our clients has been quite positive and inspiring. We love making our clients feel welcome & happy.
However, our joy has been short lived with one of our neighbours complaining to our local council about us running this business from our home. The council has issued us with a show cause notice as to why they shouldn't close us down. When I contacted the council in October last year I was told I did not need any permits or neighbour consent/notifications and it was fine to continue with the project, now 6 months later they are saying I am in breech of the by-laws associated with running a home based business and even if I do apply for a permit there are no guarantees that they will approve the business being run from the house. This has been quite a blow to our dedicated team.
What makes us stand out from other hair salons is; the service we provide, our low prices, we are kid friendly & we offer our clients affordable hair, beauty & photography products and packages that no other salon can offer. Our friendly helpful staff make it a pleasurable experience for everyone. We even offer to mind babies while our customers get pampered as well (no one else offers this service), 
We'd like to continue offering this unique service to new & existing customers, so after discussing recent events with the staff, we all agreed that to grow the business further and to stop the council closing us down, we have to relocate the business to a suitable retail outlet. 
To acheive this we need to find a suitable premises (which has been found), complete a shop fit-out,  advertise our new location and erect new signage. All of this requires a large amount of money, money that unfortunately I have already spent on the home based studio.
We need to purchase things like; work stations, wash basins, erect partition walls, paint walls in our theme colours, new flooring, plumbing and electrical work. Some furniture will be transfered to the new studio, however some items (like the wash basins & work stations) can't be removed without breaking them so we need to purchase new ones.
We would like to ask you for your assistance in helping us relocate our unique business. Any amount of financial assistance would be greatly appreciated, but if you can't help us financially you can still assist us by spreading the word about our campaign, please use Indiegogo's share tools to help spread the word.
If you are from interstate or overseas and would like to contribute to our campaign, we will reward your contribution with unique gifts to show our appreciation. If you live in Townsville or surrounding areas and would like to contribute, then you will get the opportunity to experience our services first hand or save even more money on our services if you are an existing customer, please check out our perks for more details.
With your support you will enable us to grow and expand Bella Leigha to be the best value for money studio in Australia. We invite you to visit our facebook page and our website at www.bellaleigha.com

<strong></strong>Hi, I'm Ed Thompson, an independant documentary photographer who lives and works in London. On the 15th of October I photographed a group trying to Occupy the London Stock Exchange in Central London and had no idea what I was getting into. Normally the police enforce a <em>kettle</em> (containment area) as a form of crowd control and protesters wait for hours until they can leave, but on that day something changed, when the protesters were surrounded they set up tents and built a city. I ended up photographing Occupy London for the next five months, the photographs I took were used on the OccupyLSX facebook page, on the Occupylsx.org website and on the Occupy livestream. In November 2011 an edit of the series went viral online as a multimedia piece with poetry by a young occupier, J.J, with the help of OccupyLSX, Occupy Wall St, Anonymous and a host of photography critics/editors/bloggers it was shared to over 500,000 people in a week.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Having photographed OccupyLSX since the 15th October 2011 I have a large body of work. I was present for the OccupyLSX eviction and was the only journalist/photojournalist inside the Bank of Ideas eviction. I aim to produce a low-cost 100 page photography book containing an edit of five months of photographs and interviews to create a historical document.</div>

Because pictures printed pictures look better, and photographs on any electronic device are easily deletable and easily losable.</p>
<p>Hard drives crash. Pictures get deleted. And people steal electronics. Photo books protect your once in a lifetime pictures from these threats. <strong>So if you have pictures that you want to keep, forever... Photobook'em!</strong></p>
<p>Think about it, when's the last time you:</p>
<ul>
<li>heard someone say: ""Aww man, my photo book just crashed and I lost ALL of my pictures!""</li>
<li>accidentally deleted your pictures from a photo book?</li>
<li>had someone steal your photo book, taking all of your irreplaceable pictures with them forever?</li>
</ul><p>Photo books are the best way to <em>permanently</em> store your pictures. Once pictures are in a photo book, they are a lot less susceptable to being deleted, corrupted or stolen.</p>
<p><strong>What other reasons are there to make photo books?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Printed pictures are<em> clearer</em> and <em>sharper</em> than ones on a screen and show the <em>true colors</em> of images</li>
<li>There's still something special about holding a real photo book in your hands and going through the pages, either alone or with other people, such as like friends or family</li>
<li>They are a great tool for photographers to showcase their work to potential clients</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>Why use Photobook'em to make them?</h3>
<p><strong>Photobook'em advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Faster &amp; Easier than the traditional way</li>
<li>Do it right from your home - or anywhere</li>
<li>Be finished in as little as <strong>5 minutes</strong>!</li>
<li>Costs about <strong>half as much</strong> as doing it the old, traditional way</li>
<li>Pictures can never fall out since they're printed onto the pages inside</li>
<li>Infinite cover options, use any of your own pictures or 20 other options that we have</li>
<li>Option to add your own comments or captions under the pictures</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>Now, we need your help to make it even easier to make photo books!</strong></h2>
<p>Now that we have the basic product done and the process working well, we want to make it possible to use pictures from more sources, and to make photo books from anywhere, so you will no longer have to sit at a computer to do it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our campaign has two separate stages:</h3>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Stage 1</strong></span></p>
<p>If we can raise $3,800 we can make it so people can add pictures from social networks such as like Facebook, Picasa, Flickr and Instagram into their photo books! This is our primary goal! Social networks fade and go away, anyone still have pictures on Myspace? Believe it or not Facebook may die out too. Nobody thought it would happen to Myspace, but it did. If you put your pictures into photo books you will always have them.</p>
<p><strong>$3,800 goal is to add the capability to our software that will allow printing of pictures from social networks into <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">real</span> hardcover photo books!<br/></strong></p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Stage 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Looking at pictures on a little 3 inch phone screen is definitely not the best way to see them. So we'd love to make it possible for everyone to make nice photo books from <em>anywhere</em>, at any time, using a custom App we’re going to develop!</p>
<p>The App will send us the photos from your phone or tablet and we'll send you the printed hardcover photo book!</p>
<p><strong>$12,000 <em>stretch</em> goal is to help us make an App to make photo books right from iPhones &amp; iPads and all Android devices. turning the pictures you take on your phone and tablets into durable and long lasting photo books!<br/></strong></p>

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Can I give a photo book as a gift?</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>Holiday Gift Special!</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>We have made a special holiday reward! For only <strong>$20</strong> you can get anyone a custom made 8"" x 11"" photo book, that includes up to 160 pictures printed inside! When you do the math, if you were to print out all of those pictures at 25 cents each that would cost $40.00, plus the additional cost of the cover of $5-$10. This way for 20 bucks (half as much) you can get someone a gift they can enjoy looking at for years.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Holiday Photo Book Gift"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.photobookem.com/images/holiday_gift_photobook.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Give a Custom Made Photo Book as a Gift!""/></p>
<p><strong>Please note: </strong>Image shown is only for illustration purposes, you can have any of YOUR pictures as the cover.<strong><br/><br/>How it works:</strong> As soon as you contribute and select the perk <strong>""Holiday Gift Special!""</strong> we'll immediately send you out two gift certificates with a special code on them that can be redeemed for the photo book. One certificate you can hold on to, the other you can give to the person you're giving the photo book to.</p>
<p>That way, if you want to make the photo book for them you can. If they want to make it themselves they can. Or you can sit together and both make the photo book! You can choose which pictures to add, and funny, cute or touching captions to add under each picture, together. Or you can make it for them. Or they can make it. It's up to you!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Are all of your photo books offered in hard cover?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, all of our photo books are made with hard covers. We want to make sure that you have something for years to come. In our research we found that softcover prototypes became damaged much more quickly in stress tests, such as the soft cover being bent or accidentally folded over. So we made the decision to only offer photo books the right way, in hardcover format. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What sizes of photo books do you offer?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>8"" x 8""</strong> (holds up to 80 pictures)</li>
<li>
<strong>8"" x 11""</strong> (holds up to 160 pictures)</li>
<li>
<strong>12"" x 12""</strong> (holds up to 240 pictures)</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>What cover options can I have?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Solid Color - </strong>10 solid colors that include all primary colors, and every color of the rainbow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Designer Cover - </strong>10 options that our designers came up with that range from contemporary to classic.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use Your Own Image - </strong>Here's where you can really get creative! You can use any of your images. The options are limited only by your imagination.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What are the specs of your photo books?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The pages are thick gloss finish paper, making them look great and making it easy to turn the pages.</li>
<li>The hard covers are also thick and are made from reinforced card stock which is approximately 1/8th inch thick, ensuring durability!</li>
<li>Our photo books are hand bound using side-sewn stitching to help them lay flat when opened, for easier viewing.</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you offer storage of pictures?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Our customers and backers of this campaign receive free storage. This off site storage will preserve a high-quality copy of your favorite pictures, in case of things like hard drive crashes, home fires, burglary, etc. There are no monthly recurring fees for the storage, it's yours!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Will you be developing a Blackberry App?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! If and when our first two goals are met, we will set a stretch goal so that we can also develop an App for Blackberry devices, so that people with Blackberry devices can <em>also</em> make photo books quickly and easily from their phones!</p>

When you do the math, if you were to print out all of those pictures at 25 cents each that would cost $40.00, plus the additional cost of the cover of $5-$10. This way for 20 bucks (half as much) you can get someone a gift they can enjoy looking at for years.  

Please note: Image shown is only for illustration purposes, you can have any of YOUR pictures as the cover.How it works: As soon as you contribute and select the perk ""Holiday Gift Special!"" we'll immediately send you out two gift certificates with a special code on them that can be redeemed for the photo book. One certificate you can hold on to, the other you can give to the person you're giving the photo book to.
That way, if you want to make the photo book for them you can. If they want to make it themselves they can. Or you can sit together and both make the photo book! You can choose which pictures to add, and funny, cute or touching captions to add under each picture, together. Or you can make it for them. Or they can make it. It's up to you!
 
Are all of your photo books offered in hard cover?
Yes, all of our photo books are made with hard covers. We want to make sure that you have something for years to come. In our research we found that softcover prototypes became damaged much more quickly in stress tests, such as the soft cover being bent or accidentally folded over. So we made the decision to only offer photo books the right way, in hardcover format. 
 
What sizes of photo books do you offer?


8"" x 8"" (holds up to 80 pictures)

8"" x 11"" (holds up to 160 pictures)

12"" x 12"" (holds up to 240 pictures)
 
What cover options can I have?


Solid Color - 10 solid colors that include all primary colors, and every color of the rainbow.

Designer Cover - 10 options that our designers came up with that range from contemporary to classic.

Use Your Own Image - Here's where you can really get creative! You can use any of your images. The options are limited only by your imagination.
 
What are the specs of your photo books?

The pages are thick gloss finish paper, making them look great and making it easy to turn the pages.
The hard covers are also thick and are made from reinforced card stock which is approximately 1/8th inch thick, ensuring durability!
Our photo books are hand bound using side-sewn stitching to help them lay flat when opened, for easier viewing.
 
Do you offer storage of pictures?
Yes! Our customers and backers of this campaign receive free storage. This off site storage will preserve a high-quality copy of your favorite pictures, in case of things like hard drive crashes, home fires, burglary, etc. There are no monthly recurring fees for the storage, it's yours!
 
Will you be developing a Blackberry App?
Yes! If and when our first two goals are met, we will set a stretch goal so that we can also develop an App for Blackberry devices, so that people with Blackberry devices can also make photo books quickly and easily from their phones!

<p>The idea for this project arose in the aftermath of a series of exhibitions of photographs produced by Palestinian children during a two week workshop that Phil ran together with a Palestinian colleague Ahmad Al-Bazz in 2011. The exhibition was shown in four Scottish cities and was displayed simultaneously in Bethlehem and Glasgow. We also staged live video links between Gaza, Dundee and Edinburgh. A more detailed report of the final exhibition in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh can be found here:   <a href=""http://electronicintifada.net/content/palestinian-childrens-photography-showcased-scottish-parliament/12067"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://electronicintifada.net/content/palestinian-childrens-photography-showcased-scottish-parliament/12067 </a></p>
<p>The exhibitions are estimated to have been viewed by upwards of 3,000 people and the live discussions undoubtedly brought home to those present the harsh realities faced by Palestinians.It is our experience that most of the world is kept ignorant of the true nature of Palestinian life by politicians and media with a vested interest in keeping the situation obscured.Please help us bear witness to some of the realities of the Palestinian experience by contributing to this project. Having collaborated with Rafat in Gaza, Moussa in Bethlehem and Ahmad in Nablus , it was quite clear that the model we had used of image sharing on the Internet and live video events was both feasible and successful.</p>
<h3>The Network</h3>
<p>We have therefore started to build a Network of Photographers for Palestine with the intention of sharing both our photographic and curatorial skills. As well as promoting photographic events our longer term goals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitating photography visits to Palestine</li>
<li>Facilitating photography visits for Palestinians to other parts of the world</li>
<li>Sharing advice and experience of promoting photography in Palestine.</li>
</ul><p>We now have contacts in all the main cities in Palestine, and in Brussels,Milan, Kuwait, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, London and Dublin. </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Our first joint project for which we now seek funding is the development of an exhibition to commemorate the work of two international solidarity workers, Tom Hurndall, Rachel Corrie,who lost their lives in the service of the people of Gaza. The exhibition will document the lives of these two outstanding individuals and examine current conditions in a Gaza still under siege.We are aiming to launch the exhibition on January, 13th 2014, the 10th anniversary of Tom Hurndall's death.</p>
<p>Our exhibition will also seek to forge links between solidarity workers throughout the world and the people of Palestine. We will therefore be displaying the exhibition simultaneously in at least three cities - Edinburgh, London and Gaza City. Of course, if you would like to join us in putting on the exhibition in your area we will gladly assist in sharing images and advising on various aspect of organisation.We will also be launching the exhibition with a live link-up between the centres and a discussion on ""Gaza - Then and Now"". This appeal is for funds to cover the following costs:</p>
<p>printing; £600</p>
<p>framing; £1000</p>

<h3>Support Your Local Drag Community!</h3>
<p>***A QUICK CLARIFYING NOTE: Any purchase/donation in the amount of $12 OR MORE qualifies you to receive a calendar!***</p>
<p>As 2020 comes to a close, production is well underway on the second installment of the Seattle Drag Calendar: 2021 edition. Conceived of &amp; organized by Jonah St. Croix &amp; Stephen Anunson, &amp; photographed in local grassroots venue Studio Current by Stephen Anunson, the 2020 calendar was a last-minute whirlwind of inspiration &amp; fast execution, paid for out-of-pocket by the two creators. Nonetheless, the project was a success, making back all the capital put into it, with enough profit to make a loving donation to Studio Current.</p>
<p>For 2021, we are bringing you an entirely new lineup of Seattle drag icons. Shot entirely in Anunson's home studio with the greatest consideration for social distancing &amp; individual health, this calendar features 12 original collaborations between artists &amp; photographer. 2021's featured artists are:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - <strong>The Diors</strong>
</li>
<li>February - <strong>Cookie Couture</strong>
</li>
<li>March - <strong>Lasaveona Hunt</strong>
</li>
<li>April - <strong>Mona Real</strong>
</li>
<li>May - <strong>Cherdonna Shinatra</strong>
</li>
<li>June - <strong>LüChi</strong>
</li>
<li>July - <strong>Solana Solstice</strong>
</li>
<li>August - <strong>Cannoli/Salvador</strong>
</li>
<li>September - <strong>Saira Barbaric</strong>
</li>
<li>October - <strong>Bosco</strong>
</li>
<li>November - <strong>Vincent Milay w/Peach E. Mogee</strong>
</li>
<li>December - <strong>Rosa Marchita &amp; Intim@</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Amidst all of the changes &amp; complications that 2020 has brought, we have a single burning goal for our sophomore swing at calendar-making: Put profits in the pockets of artists &amp; creators!</p>
<p>Here's where you come in:</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After much research &amp; price comparison, the cost of a reasonably-sized batch printing lands near the $1,000 mark. Additional shipping costs increase that price tag to about $1,200. A successful preorder campaign like this can inform the creators on the demand for the calendar while also knocking out the overhead cost: You are helping the calendar pay for itself, &amp; moving the profit line into the black to put dollars in the pockets of the artists you love.  All you have to do is order your calendar in advance - at a 25% discount! - &amp; invite these local queer icons into your very own home or office (or home office) for all of 2021.</p>
<p>But wait - there's more!</p>
<p>Elevate yourself from the noble realm of ""advance purchaser"" to the lofty &amp; righteous heights of ""benevolent donor""  &amp; you can receive a range of tangible tokens of gratitude (in addition to the deeply fulfilling emotional/spiritual gratitude of calendar artists &amp; creators):</p>
<ul>
<li>Get your name printed in the calendar ""thank you"" section.</li>
<li>Receive a second, smaller version of the 2021 calendar, suitable for adorning your desk, boudoir, powder room, or second, smaller salon. Also makes a fantastic gift.</li>
<li>Receive a custom, poster-sized art print of your favorite artist from either the 2020 or 2021 Seattle Drag Calendar. In addition to this years artists, listed above, options include: <strong>Betty Wetter &amp; Butylene O'Kipple</strong>; <strong>Cranberry &amp; Killer Bunny</strong>; <strong>Sugar Darling</strong>; <strong>Miss Texas 1988 &amp; Strawberry Shartcake</strong>; <strong>One</strong>; <strong>Beau Degas &amp; Bitch Hazel</strong>; <strong>Angel Baby Kill Kill Kill</strong>, &amp; <strong>Arson Nicki</strong>. (Consult with creators for prices on additional/multiple prints.)</li>
<li>Receive your own one hour portrait session with calendar creator &amp; photographer Stephen Anunson.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the 2020 absence of a nightlife scene economy - no weekly gigs, no cash-in-hand tips to get artists over the next financial hurdle - it is more important than ever that we extend our dollars toward our beloved drag performers. Reaching our goal will practically ensure the profit necessary to give everyone involved just a little financial boost before the holidays. </p>
<p>Stephen &amp; Jonah are veterans of behind-the-scenes Seattle drag, both with years-long résumés for bringing artists &amp; community together in new &amp; exciting ways. Earning funding for their sophomore calendar makes it that much easier to bring it to you again in 2022 with a whole new iconic lineup.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

***A QUICK CLARIFYING NOTE: Any purchase/donation in the amount of $12 OR MORE qualifies you to receive a calendar!***
As 2020 comes to a close, production is well underway on the second installment of the Seattle Drag Calendar: 2021 edition. Conceived of & organized by Jonah St. Croix & Stephen Anunson, & photographed in local grassroots venue Studio Current by Stephen Anunson, the 2020 calendar was a last-minute whirlwind of inspiration & fast execution, paid for out-of-pocket by the two creators. Nonetheless, the project was a success, making back all the capital put into it, with enough profit to make a loving donation to Studio Current.
For 2021, we are bringing you an entirely new lineup of Seattle drag icons. Shot entirely in Anunson's home studio with the greatest consideration for social distancing & individual health, this calendar features 12 original collaborations between artists & photographer. 2021's featured artists are:

January - The Diors

February - Cookie Couture

March - Lasaveona Hunt

April - Mona Real

May - Cherdonna Shinatra

June - LüChi

July - Solana Solstice

August - Cannoli/Salvador

September - Saira Barbaric

October - Bosco

November - Vincent Milay w/Peach E. Mogee

December - Rosa Marchita & Intim@


Amidst all of the changes & complications that 2020 has brought, we have a single burning goal for our sophomore swing at calendar-making: Put profits in the pockets of artists & creators!
Here's where you come in:
What We Need & What You Get
After much research & price comparison, the cost of a reasonably-sized batch printing lands near the $1,000 mark. Additional shipping costs increase that price tag to about $1,200. A successful preorder campaign like this can inform the creators on the demand for the calendar while also knocking out the overhead cost: You are helping the calendar pay for itself, & moving the profit line into the black to put dollars in the pockets of the artists you love.  All you have to do is order your calendar in advance - at a 25% discount! - & invite these local queer icons into your very own home or office (or home office) for all of 2021.
But wait - there's more!
Elevate yourself from the noble realm of ""advance purchaser"" to the lofty & righteous heights of ""benevolent donor""  & you can receive a range of tangible tokens of gratitude (in addition to the deeply fulfilling emotional/spiritual gratitude of calendar artists & creators):

Get your name printed in the calendar ""thank you"" section.
Receive a second, smaller version of the 2021 calendar, suitable for adorning your desk, boudoir, powder room, or second, smaller salon. Also makes a fantastic gift.
Receive a custom, poster-sized art print of your favorite artist from either the 2020 or 2021 Seattle Drag Calendar. In addition to this years artists, listed above, options include: Betty Wetter & Butylene O'Kipple; Cranberry & Killer Bunny; Sugar Darling; Miss Texas 1988 & Strawberry Shartcake; One; Beau Degas & Bitch Hazel; Angel Baby Kill Kill Kill, & Arson Nicki. (Consult with creators for prices on additional/multiple prints.)
Receive your own one hour portrait session with calendar creator & photographer Stephen Anunson.


The Impact
In the 2020 absence of a nightlife scene economy - no weekly gigs, no cash-in-hand tips to get artists over the next financial hurdle - it is more important than ever that we extend our dollars toward our beloved drag performers. Reaching our goal will practically ensure the profit necessary to give everyone involved just a little financial boost before the holidays. 
Stephen & Jonah are veterans of behind-the-scenes Seattle drag, both with years-long résumés for bringing artists & community together in new & exciting ways. Earning funding for their sophomore calendar makes it that much easier to bring it to you again in 2022 with a whole new iconic lineup.

Risks & Challenges
What happens if we don't reach our goal?
One way or another, the calendar will reach the hands of all who order it during presale! Not meeting our goal here may mean we go out-of-pocket a bit at the end of the day, but the real risks of not getting there are twofold:

It stifles the opportunity to offer the calendar to a broader audience over a longer time period at regular price.
It vastly diminishes the opportunity for artists & creators to financially profit from their work on the calendar.

<p><b>My Journey… So Far</b></p>
<p>I am currently a student at Northern Illinois University (GO
Huskies!!!) getting a degree in electrical engineering. Even though most of my
background is in the engineering field, one of my passions I truly enjoy is
photography. I’ve been given the opportunity to join the Northern Star (school
newspaper) as a photographer for the past two years taking photos at a variety
of events from sports and student club and organization events to events that
happen in our community. I was even awarded photographer of the year my first year
with the Northern Star, which was voted on by everyone who worked at the Star.</p>
<p>Being that I used the Northern Star equipment, I owned none of
my photos and was permitted to use their equipment only when shooting events
for the newspaper. Now wanting to be able to branch out and doing other things
outside the newspaper, I could really use my own equipment. I still enjoy and
will continue being a part of the Northern Star, I now want to start doing
events that are not necessarily going into the newspaper as well as be able to
create memories like putting together scrapbooks and framework people in the
community. I’m also very big into nature and love taking pictures of animals.</p>
<p>Any contribution will go a long way to get me started with
getting my first camera and equipment. This way I will not be restricted to
only doing events going in the newspaper. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><u>What I need is as

<p>Funds that I raise whether I reach my goal
or not, will go towards me purchasing my first camera and equipment.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>Your Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Your contribution
is valuable to my campaign because it will help me create priceless memories
for my community that we will be able to treasure forever. As things began to grow
and I start to cover bigger events like weddings and anniversaries, I will also
be able to hire and work with other photographers in my community. I also want
to give back to my community through my photography by donating a portion of my proceeds to a scholarship fund to help students go to college.</p>
My
only experience I have with photography is working at the Northern Star, but
through this journey I gained a lot technical skills, won an award, and really
increased my passion for photography. </div> <div> <h3></h3>

that my only experience I have is working at my school’s newspaper, one of my
biggest obstacles I would have to overcome is proving to people I have enough experience
to create priceless memories at their event or gathering. I know I can overcome
this challenge because of the type of person I am. I’m very outgoing and confident
in my abilities even though I know I have much to learn. Another obstacle I can
see myself facing is getting the word out that I am a photographer. To overcome
this challenge, I will be able to use social media (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest,
etc.) to get my name and my skills out so people can see my talent. I can also
have my friends and family be my first clients and showcase the events I do for
them. I also plan on creating a website where people can see my work and book
events.  </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p></p><p></p></div>","My Journey… So Far
I am currently a student at Northern Illinois University (GO
Huskies!!!) getting a degree in electrical engineering. Even though most of my
background is in the engineering field, one of my passions I truly enjoy is
photography. I’ve been given the opportunity to join the Northern Star (school
newspaper) as a photographer for the past two years taking photos at a variety
of events from sports and student club and organization events to events that
happen in our community. I was even awarded photographer of the year my first year
with the Northern Star, which was voted on by everyone who worked at the Star.
Being that I used the Northern Star equipment, I owned none of
my photos and was permitted to use their equipment only when shooting events
for the newspaper. Now wanting to be able to branch out and doing other things
outside the newspaper, I could really use my own equipment. I still enjoy and
will continue being a part of the Northern Star, I now want to start doing
events that are not necessarily going into the newspaper as well as be able to
create memories like putting together scrapbooks and framework people in the
community. I’m also very big into nature and love taking pictures of animals.
Any contribution will go a long way to get me started with
getting my first camera and equipment. This way I will not be restricted to
only doing events going in the newspaper. 
   
What I Need & What You Get
What I need is as
follows:
· 
Canon EOS Rebel T6i Digital

Funds that I raise whether I reach my goal
or not, will go towards me purchasing my first camera and equipment.   
Your Impact

Your contribution
is valuable to my campaign because it will help me create priceless memories
for my community that we will be able to treasure forever. As things began to grow
and I start to cover bigger events like weddings and anniversaries, I will also
be able to hire and work with other photographers in my community. I also want
to give back to my community through my photography by donating a portion of my proceeds to a scholarship fund to help students go to college.
My
only experience I have with photography is working at the Northern Star, but
through this journey I gained a lot technical skills, won an award, and really
increased my passion for photography.

</h3> Our journey from traditional photography into a Geek specialization began with our 3 Cosplay obsessed children. They are rarely out of costume and they even stay dressed up when we go out grocery shopping. It goes so deep into their genes, our littlest daughter's first words were actually ""Iron Man"". Their love of Cosplay is so strong that they convinced us to take our photography in a new direction! Needless to say we share their passion for their heroes both in fantasy and Cosplay! <br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/486312/files/20140405142434-for_indiegogo_kids.jpg?1396733074"" src="""" style=""width: 458.875px; height: 310px;""/></p><h3>What Did We Discover?</h3><p></p><p>We
 couldn’t understand how we had to do a style of photography that we 
were not passionate about to fund the style we were. What was stopping us? With much discussion, we leapt in 
with everything, re-branded our entire business into Geek photography and
 have had the time of our lives since! This website is intended to offer
 Cosplayers and Cosplay Photographers, these amazing people who put so 
much energy and care into what they do, the ability to see a return from
 the things they are passionate about too! It is expensive on both sides
 but we can help remove all of the costs and risks associated with 
selling prints and the spent shipping. </p><br/><h3>How We Want To Change Cosplay!</h3><p>We
 have spent the last 6 months researching, developing, and talking to 
the community and it has lead us to a single driving goal. The
 goal is to create a website that will allow any Cosplayer and/or 
Cosplay Photographer, from newbie to professional, the ability to sell 
prints at no risk, no cost and remove the shipping hassle. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">When a print 
is sold it gets produced, shipped and the Cosplayer/ Photographer gets 
paid!</span>  It
 will be branded as CosplayPrintsOf.me, and targeted at the 155,000 
people searching for Cosplay every day. We even get contacted through our business website about buying prints of the Cosplayers we have photographed and we are not marketing it! It will most importantly be quality controlled to ensure that 
every images is it's very best and the quality will be consistent. We intend to bring the ability to sell prints to 
everyone and don’t worry, we have a plan for signed prints as well!  </p><br/><h3>Why You Matter!</h3><p>Ultimately
 with your help, we can create a new reality with in the Cosplay 
community for you as Cosplayers and as Cosplay Photographers.  If we go to financial investors, we are obligated to charge more to be able to pay them in return for the funds they provided. This would reduce the profit for the websites users. With your investment instead, the website will be able to keep it's costs lowered and pay that money back out to you on your print sales! <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>With the 
ability to sell prints and make money available to all Cosplayers and Cosplay 
Photographers there will be a world of new opportunities. Just imagine 
the possibilities! Cosplayers
 will be able to fund new costumes, new props, attend more conventions, 
gain more photographs, gain more fans and drive the prestige of everyone
 up. Cosplay
 Photographers will gain new ability to buy equipment, learn new 
lighting styles, purchase new lenses and camera bodies, pay for travel, 
studios, hire Cosplayers to model and be able to pay them for their 
work!</p><br/><h3>What We Need</h3><p>We
 need your help to raise the $50,000 dollars required to pay for the 
website, the printing equipment and ink, shipping materials, a computer to authorize and manage images, online advertising and long term hosting. <br/></p><p>By using 
Indiegogo to raise the funds, we can completely remove the need for investors.

 a vendor through Cosplayprintsof.me, you will choose an image, upload 
it and set your profit splitting. The image will then go through an 
approval process to ensure it meets the standards of the website (basic 
image quality, non pornographic, not a duplicate or stolen) and then be 
posted. Free accounts will be to choose the print size, be able to share
 links directly to that image on their social media and keyword it for 
easy searching. Premium accounts can set a maximum print total to sell, 
organize their offerings on their vanity site, offer an optional 
signature on the print, be able to view statistics and see where the 
views are coming from. You can even  choose this image to appear in the 
front page feature rotation.</p><br/><p>The
 moment it is available for sale, it can be printed and sold! <br/></p><p><br/></p><h3><span>Signed Prints Are Why People Buy Prints Of Cosplay!</span></h3><p><br/>We
 are aware that signatures and personalization add value to a print and 
to some it is seen as the only reason people buy Cosplay prints. To ensure 
this is not lost, we have created a system to allow you to sign 
your posters if you choose, but with all the ease of use and cost 
reductions we want this website to provide. </p><p>Here's how:</p><p>The
 Cosplayer or Photographer sets a time period, lets say every 2 weeks, 
and as orders come in the fan is notified of the estimated shipping date
 on signed copies. When the order arrives and is paid for, we produce 
the requested prints for that Cosplayer or Photographer, organize them 
and provide the name/request of each purchaser. Once the 2 weeks are up,
 we ship the prints ready to be personalized to the Cosplayer or 
Photographer. They will arrive complete with all the materials required 
to send it on it's way after it's signed. We will include all the 
packaging and shipping labels, so you just sign and ship away.  </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Why We Created Our Tiers</h3><p>To
 be able to put as much money into making this dream a reality we have 
opted to offer the premium membership at an increasing discount to early
 adopters and to offer limited time discounts on prints for fans. We have also 
created tiers to allow companies and websites that support and love Cosplay the ability to connect with fans through advertising. The higher
 the tier you buy, the better the deal we can offer on discounts! Premium members 
will always have a special feature on the front page, where members will be 
randomly selected and displayed to promote them to the 155,000 people 
searching for Cosplay everyday.</p><br/><p>Buying
 in starting at the 2 year tier for only $95 ($25 off the price when the
 site is live) gets you the special Founder status. Founder status comes 
with the perk of having a single image appearing on the front page, 
chosen by you, so that visitors to the website will be greeted by your work and directed to your page. The 
website will also be able to run ads by Cosplayers and Photographers to 
drive traffic to their Facebook pages, websites, and Tumblr. To get this
 happening right off the start, the higher tiers have an advertising 
credit built right in for a seriously discounted rate. You don't have to activate it at launch though, as you will be able to save

our original goal of giving as much back as possible. </p><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><p>This project will enable anyone to develop their fame, make new connections and earn an income while striving to be better at what they love. It can offer compelling reasons for Cosplayers and Photographers to collaborate and create new works of art, and grow the 
community we love so much. It will destroy the expectation that one has to be famous or sponsored to even have a chance at selling prints and developing fame. It will connect you to new fans, friends and lovers of creativity. It will change the face of Cosplay for everyone. <br/><br/>For us, as photographers, this will open new streams of revenue and help bring the Geek specialty of photography even further into the mainstream. As parents it will
allow us to introduce our children to more amazing Cosplayers and Photographers and help them realize their dream of meeting them all. <br/></p><p>We have over the last 6 months poured all of our time, effort and money into creating this website and now we are counting on you to help us bring it into reality.

costs, impacting how much we will be able to return to the community. We will still make it a reality and continue to work towards 
our original goal of giving as much back as possible. The ImpactThis project will enable anyone to develop their fame, make new connections and earn an income while striving to be better at what they love. It can offer compelling reasons for Cosplayers and Photographers to collaborate and create new works of art, and grow the 
community we love so much. It will destroy the expectation that one has to be famous or sponsored to even have a chance at selling prints and developing fame. It will connect you to new fans, friends and lovers of creativity. It will change the face of Cosplay for everyone. For us, as photographers, this will open new streams of revenue and help bring the Geek specialty of photography even further into the mainstream. As parents it will
allow us to introduce our children to more amazing Cosplayers and Photographers and help them realize their dream of meeting them all. We have over the last 6 months poured all of our time, effort and money into creating this website and now we are counting on you to help us bring it into reality. We can not thank you enough for reading, watching and sharing this passion with us. Sincerely and Thankfully,Jessie and Courtney PozzoloPs.Aria, Tevye and Kyrene say: Thank you! We can't wait to see what you are Cosplaying!Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are not able to contribute, could you make some noise about our campaign?

<p>I am Daryl Banks, I am a professional photographer and I came out as being transgender this past November to all my friends, family and clients. Coming out in the public forum was not an easy choice to make but after a long conversation with my father I was reminded of the importance of doing the right thing even if it makes things harder for me. <br/><br/>That is why I am here looking for your help.</p>
<p>I am looking to raise funds for a conceptual photography project about the experience of crossing over from one expression of gender to another. <br/><br/><strong>Crossing The Gender Barrier</strong></p>
<p>My Photography Project on Being Trans</p>
<p>My new photography project is about what it means to ""pass"" as a trans person and the varying degrees of tolerance and acceptance that is granted to transgender persons based on how well they meet the stereotypes and desired psychical characteristics of their target gender. Society may be tolerant of trans people but this is usually when no one can tell they are trans and unfortunately this leaves a lot of people sitting out in the dark who might not ""pass"" well enough to feel that tolerance. Unfortunately how well one ""passes"" in their target gender is very contingent on how much money they have.</p>
<p>Through <strong>raising visibility</strong> and dialogue I hope we can move pass tolerance and into open acceptance for all transgender people in all stages and degrees of gender expression. <br/><br/>I will be exploring issues such as passing, gender archetypes and the process of transitioning from one gender role to another through two separate but intertwining photo projects.</p>
<p><strong>Part One</strong></p>
<p>The main component of the series will be using the visual narrative of tableaux (staged) photography to express the ideas and feelings I have towards my own transition and the conflict I have with socially constructed gender norms in what I see as a very narrow and limiting gender binary system. Specifically I am going to focus on archetypes of male and female gender roles in contemporary western society and what expectations and roles come along with that. It is my hope that I will be able to work with people from various backgrounds and classes. It is also my intention to stay clear from overly sexualized imagery that only celebrates trans people if they have sex appeal or can be fetishized. The photos will be taken in studio and on location over the next several months. With tableaux photography the importance of the scene, location, lighting, props and wardrobe are an important part of the visual language and essential to the story being told.</p>
<p><strong>Part Two</strong></p>
<p>The second component of my project will be a series of portraits that will be manipulated through the process of traditional polaroid transfers. Polaroid transfers work by peeling apart the negative image from the photo paper before the print is finished developing and then applying that same negative image with the emulsion to a different surface of your choosing. The symbolic use of polaroid transfers for this project comes from the ability to pull the negative image away from the receiving paper and transfer that negative image (and the emulsion) to a surface of my choice for a look of my choosing. Thus the process of polarid transfers have come to represent my gender transition from a presumed surface and outcome to one that I can choose to play with for my own desired outcome and aesthetic taste. The lack of clarity and hence mysterious charm of polaroid transfers will also serve as a visual representation of the misconceptions and confusion the general public has about trans people.</p>
<p><br/>By helping to fund my project you are helping me bring about visibility to the various trans communities and hopefully bring about more acceptance of trans people.</p>
<p><br/><strong>List of Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Polaroid Film                          $500</p>

<p><br/><strong>What If I Don't Raise The Bling?</strong><br/><br/>It would be awesome if I can raise the funds to see my vision through but I realize I might be dreaming pretty big. <br/><br/>The project will continue regardless of how much money is raised and I would simply scale the project down to accommodate a smaller budget. I have a pretty clear vision of what I want to do and it would be amazing to have access to the costumes, props and tools I need in order to share my vision with others as accurately as possible.</p>
<p>Scroll down to see all the cool perks and deals I am offering like prints, postcards and even photo sessions!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>While I am looking at raising question about the confinements and structure of a narrow binary gender system my main goal is raise awareness around the various trans communities that need much more support, and a louder voice. <br/><br/>My photography has been published on the covers and pages of several international magazines and my work has been displayed in art galleries from Canada to Holland. For the last few years I have worked as a wedding photographer and before that I worked as a studio photographer and photo assistant to several commercial photographers. I have a lot of experience lighting sets in studio and on location and I believe I have a solid track record as a professional and creative photographer to pull this project off. When the series is near completion I will begin looking for a gallery to show the work. In addition to a gallery show I will also be building a blog in the new year to act as a hub for my transgender related projects. The blog will feature works in progress, outtakes, some writings, and several smaller series of photo essays. <br/><br/>Even if you can't help with money please help me spread the word about what I am doing by sharing on your blog, twitter, facebook, wherever. It is all greatly appreciated and will help me immensely with my own project and also with keeping a dialog going. Trans rights have come along way but there is still a long road ahead.</p>

Hello, my name is Catherine Harwick, I am a 3rd semister student at The Southeast Center for Photographic Studies at Daytona State College. I am earning my Assiciates Degree and my dream is to own my own photography business. Providing family's with quality discounted on location portrait packages. My husband and I will head the business. He will take care of the Graphic Arts (video, website, editing) and I will capture unique slices of the life to create lasting memorries. Currently, we are a one income house hold and times are hard. The sooner I can get my home based LLC off the ground, get my name (Slice of Life Photoz) registered with the Small Business Administration, I can start contrubuting to my famiy. 


What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:
We need $2000.00 to pay for start up costs, including registring my business name, obtaining LLC, and purchising supplies. If my goal is not reached I will use all of what is graciously contributed to atleast obtain the rights to my business name. I would love to honor each contributer individually by posting Thank You's to Face Book and on my personal blog.
 


The Impact
You will be helping us change our lives for the better. To be able to afford to open my own business is like winning the lottery.

These on-location workshops offer an immersive multi-day experience in very personal group settings. We hope to offer our students an array of photo destinations to choose from, but this cannot be done simply overnight.</p><p>Research and development of workshops starts at least one year prior, as we always scout a location at the same time of year that we would offer the workshop, to ensure consistency in climate, lighting angles, and floral and faunal composition.</p><p>Planning and scouting is hard work. We arrive at a location prepared, having virtually “pre-scouted” the terrain, moon/sun cycles, and angles of sunlight through mapping and surveying programs. Then, on location, we visually determine the best compositions, and confirm the ideal shooting times for creating the most impactful images of a certain landmark, which we can then incorporate into the curriculum for the workshop we create for the following year. </p><p>With your help, our next scouting trip will take place in the Northern Rocky Mountains of Alberta, British Columbia, and Montana immediately following our Mount Rainier and Olympic National Park workshop this August 2015. Your pledge will not only make it possible for us to conduct our scouting with the level of professionalism that we insist on, but could even give you the opportunity to participate in the workshop we create in the Northern Rockies for 2016, or any of our others being offered. At the very least, you’ll have a beautiful photo to decorate your home with. </p><p>Though our first teaching experience as a business was just last September, we’ve since already fully booked several workshops to Maine, South Carolina and Oregon. Guiding our students in gaining confidence in photography has proven to us that we have the formula for success, and now all we need is the financial means to make our dreams for this business a reality. </p><h1>The Future of BlueHour Photo Ventures</h1><p>There are many other locations that we would like our clients to experience and photograph. Workshop locations must always be scouted beforehand in order to know when and where to take the best shots, creating a fabulous learning experience for our clients. However, we are limited by time, as we both have full-time careers that we cannot simply neglect if we want to eat and pay rent. Research and development of the workshops is absolutely key, and we would be able to do more of this if funded.</p><h1>Your Donation</h1><p>What would your donation mean to us? It would essentially buy us the time we need, as well as make it possible financially, to research and scout locations that have been beyond our reach. In particular, the northern rockies is a stunningly beautiful area and is a must for anyone interested in nature photography. With your help, we plan to scout Banff and Yoho national parks in Alberta and Glacier National Park in Montana. Through this, we will design a thorough and cohesive educational experiences in this location for potential future workshops. Let us help you photograph the most amazing nature location and create your most beautiful and unique shots. Overall, your funding would give us a headstart in making BlueHour Photo Ventures the focus of our careers.</p><h1>Our Itinerary</h1><p>August 13: Fly from Seattle, WA to Calgary, AB</p><p>August 14-17: Scouting Banff National Park</p><ul>

<h3>Welcome to Sucker Punched 4!</h3>
<p>We had so much success with Sucker Punched 3 (105% Funded!) and got so many requests to run another series, we had to bring things back for another go 'round. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521566520/b0htl57d0yrjhedavx4n.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h2><strong>What is Sucker Punched?</strong></h2>
<p>I'm glad you asked! Sucker Punched is a photography series, wherein we take some of the many amazing, talented, inspiring women we know and we give them the SP treatment, a transformation into an original action hero. These women, in cooperation with our creative team, become badass, dangerous, gorgeous, iconic figures to match anything you'd find in a comic book or action movie. A character of their own making, an alter ego they get to become. </p>
<p>Sucker Punched was primarily inspired by the 2011  Zack Snyder film, <i>Sucker Punch.</i> When we started doing a few test shoots,matching the tone and style, the project later grew and took on a sense of empowerment and agency. We had a lot of models interested in doing a shoot of this style and a lot of fans interested in seeing more. With great power came great responsibility, and as people shared their stories with us, we felt compelled to create something with a social statement and give to an organization that's given so much to so many, <a href=""http://www.RAINN.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAINN</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal with Sucker Punched is to present original characters created in the style of powerful archetypes. We've got designs drawn from the best of fiction, local and regional models who will knock it out of the park,  fine photographic skills, and the costumes/hair/makeup/props to bring it all together. The models involved are presented as a celebration of powerful women, dangerous and strong. </p>
<p>More than just a traditional ""ladies with weapons in skimpy outfits"" project, Sucker Punched is looking to showcase women at their strongest. There is no need to sacrifice femininity for strength. The women of this work are strong, powerful, beautiful and deadly. By subverting and reworking the stereotypical archetypes of ""sexy girls"" into powerful icons, we create a world where women aren't powerful in spite of their gender, but because of it. The goal is the celebration of empowerment, not debasement.</p>
<p>Drawing from sources large and small - the Valkyrie, Sarah Connor, Johanna Dark, Aeon Flux, Kill Bill, Tomb Raider, Firefly, Appleseed, Resident Evil, Underworld, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Matrix,Wonder Woman, Black Widow, Legend of The Seeker, Xena: Warrior Princess, and many more - we've crafted a series of characters and set ups that we think showcase a strong, solid and fun concept.</p>
<p>The ""bad guys"", as it were, are all off screen. They're the everyday struggles of the world. They're the perpetrators of abuse, discrimination, prejudice, assault. The foes you can't physically strike at, but must battle everyday nonetheless. Sucker Punched creates a photographic kick to the face to all these dark forces. We show the women of this project at their strongest, a fighter, a warrior of light. While the last few years have seen a sharp uptick in female heroes, we still have a long way to go. The women warriors of Sucker Punched are nobody's love interest, nobody's sidekick, nobody's damsel-in-distress. They are the hero of the story. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Why are we crowdfunding? Good question</p>
<ul>
<li>We need help offsetting our expenses. Money is required for studio time, costumes, prop weapons, hair products, makeup,  and travel. We're also keen on paying the artists who share their talents with us. </li>
<li>We're also giving 10% of our funding to RAINN, and any additional revenue generated from these shoots will also be sent that way. Remember, that's not 10% of our proceeds, or 10% of what's left, that's 10% off the top. The <strong>first</strong> place we send money is RAINN. </li>
<li>Additionally, we buy a lot of costumes and accessories from small business owners, to help support them. </li>

<p>Our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sucker-punched-a-photo-project/x/2593569#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first time</a> doing this, we raised $2176 to put towards this project (less Indiegogo's fees). $217.60 immediately went to RAINN. The <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sucker-punched-2/x/2593569#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">second time</a>, we raised $1863 (less IGG fees) and $183.30 immediately went to RAINN. The *<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sucker-punched-3-photography-cosplay/x/2593569#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">third time</a>*, we raised 5,325 (less IGG fees) and $532.50 immediately went to RAINN. </p>
<p> After RAINN gets their cut, we pour the rest into making the magic happen. 10 characters in series  1,  12 characters in series 2 , and 13 characters in series 3, were created, built, refined and photographed. We produced prints, calendars, a photo book, mugs, and posters and shipped them all over the country to eager fans. </p>
<p>This year, for Sucker Punched 4....we're going to blow the lid off this ride. The goal this year is to make <strong>20 new characters</strong>, and have 6 returning characters from previous seasons. Crazy? Maybe? But I think we can make it happen. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We're offering some fantastic perks with this season! We've trimmed a few unpopular ones, and added a few new ones. As always, we've got lots of great options for prints and images of our SP4 photos. We've got our 16 month calendar (Our most popular perk!).  We've also got some merch (Coffee Mug and Pocket Knife) for those who aren't into prints. We've got our portrait session with FightGuy Photography! We've got hand made artwork from the members of the team! We've got a 95% delivery rate on our perks in previous series, and people love them! Also, every year we've always thrown in a few extra surprises, so you'll get more than you expect!</p>
<p>** Perks will be highlighted in upcoming spotlight posts as the campaign counts down, we're stuck with a 500 character limit on the spaces you see to the right**</p>
<h3>Special Military Perk</h3>
<p>For any of our backers who are active or former military, we offer a special bonus of an additional print and a personal thank you letter from our team. Please let us know when you submit your perk. </p>
<h3>How are we doing things differently this time around? </h3>
<p>That's an excellent question! First and foremost, we've almost doubled the number of models and characters we will be working with. When we ran our casting call, we received over 80 applications to be in this project. Almost triple what we were expecting. So we're taking a chance and seeing if we can handle so much more. </p>
<p>Secondly, and we did this a bit in series 3, we're going to open the field up a little bit more, take a bigger step away from the source material, the film Sucker Punch. Because that film was very firearm centric, we made an effort to keep that artistic choice in our work. In the last few years, the national conversation around guns has been lively, to say the least. While we at FightGuy Photography have always held the belief that the world of fantasy violence is distinctly different from the world of actual violence, we recognize the discomfort and the tension around this topic. To that end, this year many of our characters will feature additional weapons and abilities, to take things away from our gun-centric past. Superpowers, Sci-fi weapons, and lots more are all on the list. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What is this project all about? Well, first, it's a heck of a lot of fun. Moreover, it's a project that creates and promotes a positive message. These characters are feminine and powerful. They have full agency over who they are and what they're doing. In today's world, we can't get enough of that.  Additionally you'll help provide exposure and experience to a number of talented young professionals, dancers, actresses, models, makeup artists and costume designers. And of course, I can't mention this enough, you'll be helping us help <a href=""http://www.RAINN.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAINN</a>. </p>
<p>The models in these photo series have told us time and time again how healing this process is for them. How strong and heroic they feel. How they think back to their character when times are tough and that keeps them moving. It's really magical and I'm thrilled we have a project that lets us create and share that with our fans. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>What are we risking? Well if we can't pull this off, if we can't raise the money and make this happen, well, that's a bummer. We love this project with all our hearts and we love seeing it fly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If contributing to this project is not your thing, that's totally ok! Not to worry. We appreciate you being here, watching our videos and reading this post about it. </p>

We had so much success with Sucker Punched 3 (105% Funded!) and got so many requests to run another series, we had to bring things back for another go 'round. 

What is Sucker Punched?
I'm glad you asked! Sucker Punched is a photography series, wherein we take some of the many amazing, talented, inspiring women we know and we give them the SP treatment, a transformation into an original action hero. These women, in cooperation with our creative team, become badass, dangerous, gorgeous, iconic figures to match anything you'd find in a comic book or action movie. A character of their own making, an alter ego they get to become. 
Sucker Punched was primarily inspired by the 2011  Zack Snyder film, Sucker Punch. When we started doing a few test shoots,matching the tone and style, the project later grew and took on a sense of empowerment and agency. We had a lot of models interested in doing a shoot of this style and a lot of fans interested in seeing more. With great power came great responsibility, and as people shared their stories with us, we felt compelled to create something with a social statement and give to an organization that's given so much to so many, RAINN.
Our goal with Sucker Punched is to present original characters created in the style of powerful archetypes. We've got designs drawn from the best of fiction, local and regional models who will knock it out of the park,  fine photographic skills, and the costumes/hair/makeup/props to bring it all together. The models involved are presented as a celebration of powerful women, dangerous and strong. 
More than just a traditional ""ladies with weapons in skimpy outfits"" project, Sucker Punched is looking to showcase women at their strongest. There is no need to sacrifice femininity for strength. The women of this work are strong, powerful, beautiful and deadly. By subverting and reworking the stereotypical archetypes of ""sexy girls"" into powerful icons, we create a world where women aren't powerful in spite of their gender, but because of it. The goal is the celebration of empowerment, not debasement.
Drawing from sources large and small - the Valkyrie, Sarah Connor, Johanna Dark, Aeon Flux, Kill Bill, Tomb Raider, Firefly, Appleseed, Resident Evil, Underworld, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Matrix,Wonder Woman, Black Widow, Legend of The Seeker, Xena: Warrior Princess, and many more - we've crafted a series of characters and set ups that we think showcase a strong, solid and fun concept.
The ""bad guys"", as it were, are all off screen. They're the everyday struggles of the world. They're the perpetrators of abuse, discrimination, prejudice, assault. The foes you can't physically strike at, but must battle everyday nonetheless. Sucker Punched creates a photographic kick to the face to all these dark forces. We show the women of this project at their strongest, a fighter, a warrior of light. While the last few years have seen a sharp uptick in female heroes, we still have a long way to go. The women warriors of Sucker Punched are nobody's love interest, nobody's sidekick, nobody's damsel-in-distress. They are the hero of the story. 
 

What We Need
Why are we crowdfunding? Good question

We need help offsetting our expenses. Money is required for studio time, costumes, prop weapons, hair products, makeup,  and travel. We're also keen on paying the artists who share their talents with us. 
We're also giving 10% of our funding to RAINN, and any additional revenue generated from these shoots will also be sent that way. Remember, that's not 10% of our proceeds, or 10% of what's left, that's 10% off the top. The first place we send money is RAINN. 
Additionally, we buy a lot of costumes and accessories from small business owners, to help support them. 
For your support, you get access to exclusive merch, prints, photobooks, and much more from the series. 

Our first time doing this, we raised $2176 to put towards this project (less Indiegogo's fees). $217.60 immediately went to RAINN. The second time, we raised $1863 (less IGG fees) and $183.30 immediately went to RAINN. The *third time*, we raised 5,325 (less IGG fees) and $532.50 immediately went to RAINN. 
 After RAINN gets their cut, we pour the rest into making the magic happen. 10 characters in series  1,  12 characters in series 2 , and 13 characters in series 3, were created, built, refined and photographed. We produced prints, calendars, a photo book, mugs, and posters and shipped them all over the country to eager fans. 
This year, for Sucker Punched 4....we're going to blow the lid off this ride. The goal this year is to make 20 new characters, and have 6 returning characters from previous seasons. Crazy? Maybe? But I think we can make it happen.

volunteer tourism opportunities in Peru that will be published in a photo book and online.  Peru is a country with vastly different
landscapes from desert coastlines to grand mountain ranges and Amazon River jungles. 
I have chosen volunteer organizations in differing regions to
demonstrate the diversity of geography and volunteer opportunities available
to those who would like to add meaning to their travel experience.  Images produced will range from capturing
aspects of everyday life and culture, volunteer activities, and the grandeur
of the ever-changing earth.</p><p><br/></p>

incredible altitudes of the Andes Mountains? Can I learn from the 
experiences there and teach others through the visual work I produce?</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Conquering fear is another big thing of mine. Fear stops 
us all from being happy and experiencing things that may enrich us or 
may teach 
us a valuable lesson! Although I fell in love with rain forests many 
years ago when traveling in Costa Rica, I admit that I am a bit 
apprehensive about spending a month in the jungle 
with no electricity and no roads, but because I fear it, I must face it.
 Giant 
tarantulas and all!!!!! Aieeeeeeee!</p><p><br/></p><p>I live to travel, because travel feels like the best way 
to learn about others, as well as about myself, and each trip helps me determine 
areas in my life which need adjustment. I want to ask questions and learn how we 
are the same, how we are different and why? Understanding is the key to peace. In this ever-more-connected world, I want to learn how different cultures deal with their similar 
problems.  I do not go there with 
the idea that I can fix it, but rather I offer the ability to photograph and demonstrate what I observe. It's an exchange, through sharing thoughts and ideas, perhaps better options will be within our reach. Visually telling the stories is a goal, but being fully 
involved in the experience, not always making photos, is also a goal. Just 
learning and understanding and contributing what I can, wherever I can. There is much for 
everyone to gain when we try to really get beyond the surface of things when we 
travel, so this project 
is to share the experiences I have while doing what has become known as 
volunteer tourism. I picked Peru for many reasons, but I picked 
the broader category of a Spanish-speaking country first. I've found that language can be one of the biggest barriers during my travels. Communication is still possible and wonderful, but true depth comes when there is a common language.

 Huaraz, I will spend one month volunteering with Seeds of Hope, a small
 NGO that works with around 60 children aged between 6 and 18 who are at
 high risk of 
dropping out of public school and with a small number of children who do
 not 
attend public school, in order to raise the standard of their reading 
and writing to enable them to enter the education system. A supportive 
educational environment to assist with homework is provided, which is 
crucial because most of the kids come from families where the parents 
have to work long hours to support the family and often cannot read or 
write themselves. Educating the parents about the importance of their 
children staying in schools and the long-term benefits this will bring 
to the children and family is another aspect of the work. As a volunteer
 I will tutor students in a variety of subjects, as well as teach a 
variety of subjects to help enrich the student's educational experience.
 <br/></p><p>From Huaraz I will return to Lima, and spend between 2-4 
weeks in the desert coastal region, photographing the landscape as well 
as the culture.  There is a tentative volunteer option for this region, 
as well, but details are not finalized. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Your Funding &amp; Perk</b><b>s</b></p><p>I'm asking for a minimum of $1,000 in funding because while the trip will cost me at least $6k (see general trip budget below), <b>the

won't be earning any

a multi-media documentary could be produced as well. But that's

weeks in the desert coastal region, photographing the landscape as well 
as the culture.  There is a tentative volunteer option for this region, 
as well, but details are not finalized. Your Funding & PerksI'm asking for a minimum of $1,000 in funding because while the trip will cost me at least $6k (see general trip budget below), the
 $1,000 or more you provide will solidify the need for me to complete 
the project despite any and all challenges faced along the way. I 
won't be earning any 
income for the months while I'm there, but this is my life's calling, finding and photographing the good in the world, so
 the risk is worth it. There is no limit 
on how much money may be raised above the minimum during this time. 
Think of it this way, you're funding the creation of your future art 
collection piece! My time period for being in Peru will be for the months of August-November.  This campaign will be ongoing during part of the time I am in Peru, and although I will not have access to electricity or communication while in the jungle, at any point when I have access, I will certainly provide trip updates along the way.It
 would, of course, rock my 
socks right off if you generous souls out there funded the entire travel
 period of the project in Peru, and it would cause me to weep and grovel
 at your feet in absolute 
gratitude if you somehow pooled together to additionally sustain me 
financially upon my return when I 
will be spending additional months putting all the work together on 
websites, in the coffee table book and making prints. With additional 
time funded, 
a multi-media documentary could be produced as well. But that's 
the blue sky big picture! Anything from the goal of $1,000 and above 
will be 
amazingly helpful, will have my deepest thanks, and will be rewarded as 
described in the Perks section of this page! Hand-written postcards 
from Peru, archival-quality signed prints, photo books, my stuffed 
monkey and a personalized video message from me - with trip footage - 
potentially with me handling the dreaded tarantula - are amongst the perks available! Is there a perk I've not listed 
that would inspire you to fund? By all means, let me know what you 
would like, and I will try to accommodate! General Trip Budget (No post-production time/costs are included)
Yellow Fever & Rabies Vaccinations for Jungle Travel - $865


Round-trip airfare Memphis - Lima - Memphis - $1,400Jason generously covered this with his airline mileage!

Round-trip airfare Lima - Pucallpa - Lima - $215
One month's room & board at Esperanza Verde - $300
Round-trip airfare Lima - Cusco - Lima - $320
One month's room & board in Cusco - approx $500 

4-day Inca Trail Trek - approx $400

Round-trip bus fare Lima - Huaraz - Lima - approx $50
One month's room & board in Huaraz - approx $500
Travel expenses in desert coastal region for 2-4 weeks - Approx $500
Fixed expenses back home (which must continue to be paid in my absence) - $400/month - so, at 4 months = $1,600
Total (minus unexpected and/or unplanned costs - which there always are): $6,615 now $5,250. I thank you for your time in reviewing my proposal, and for any support
 you may provide! Don't forget to check out the Perks, and If you know anyone else who may be interested in 
this project, please spread the word!-Amie",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

This we want to do with a bang. We want to raise money for our end of year degree show in London, part of the Free Range Art &amp; Design Show at the Old Truman Brewery. This is a yearly graduate summer show taking place from the 29<sup>th</sup> May – 16<sup>th</sup> July 2012, showcasing some of the hottest new talent in art and design. Our show is taking place from the 21st - 25th of June, with a private opening on Thursday 21st. </p>
<p>As photography students from Swansea, being able to exhibit in London is not only a great opportunity, but also a luxury, and as with most luxuries it must be paid for. The students are themselves responsible for getting the funds needed, and normally this money comes straight from the students’ pockets and traditional means of fundraising. There are many positive aspects of the traditional ways of fundraising, but we find there are also limitations to it. For example, to donate it often requires you to physically be at the event, and this is not needed with crowd-funding, which gives our family, friends and the general public an easy way to donate.</p>
<p>A photography degree can be very expensive, and especially in the third year, with the graduate show etc., many students struggle to make the ends meet financially, so this year we have decided to try new ways of funding to ensure we leave with the best possible graduate show for all of us.</p>
<p>In total we need to raise £ 13 000 (a small amount of this money will go to the graduate show held in Swansea). So far we have raised £ 12 355, but we need to raise at least £645. This is the minimum amount needed, and we are hoping to raise at least $1000 (approximately £ 630) with 'indiegogo'. </p>
<p>By raising this money, we can create a show, which begins, to not only put our work, but ourselves into a professional creative industry. </p>
<p>The work we have produced and developed over the last 3 years culminates in this exhibition. The money will contribute towards creating a visually stimulating and exciting show, as the more funds we can raise, the better quality of the show we can produce. We want to create a quality show to present our work in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Having the London Show will also widen our opportunity to network, and start the process of having our work seen by the current professionals in the field. This is the most important time, as once we become graduates, it is critical we begin to get our names, and work known and recognized as it is tough for every new graduate to survive in such a talented and competitive area.</p>
<p>With every financial input we will be extremely grateful, and would appreciate people spreading our cause by any means, facebook, blogs, word of mouth etc. Any donation we recieve would mean a big thank you from us and goes towards a show of great work.</p></div>","We are a group of students from Swansea Metropolitan University, graduating from the BA (Hons) Photography in the Arts & BA (Hons) Photojournalism courses this summer.

</p><h3>About me</h3>
My name is Gerrit. I am a 33 year old photographer and I am currently living in Berlin. I started my photographic career 13 years ago and worked as a freelance photographer for the last 8 years. I am mainly focused on documentary portraiture as I am interested in other peoples lives and a curious person. Taking a portrait of someone makes the encounter last for a long time for me.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I traveled to South Afrika and other African countries several times and on different missions and I started getting more involved with the topic of gender based violence, sexual violence and rape after a trip so South Africa and Namibia in 2011.</p>
<h3>About sexual violence in South Africa</h3>
<p>The numbers that describe the situation are shocking: regarding to different surveys about 30% of the women in South Africa are victims of sexual violence while depending on sources between 25% and 40% of men admit having committed sexual violence or raped a woman.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>What I want to do</h3>
I want to find out more about how these numbers did arise. So I will be in Johannesburg from May 3rd to June 3rd to create a body of work that consists of photography and text mainly. It is more a humanistic approach and not going to be a academic social study, it will be an artistic-documentary work more than a journalistic work. Maybe it is more about asking questions than actually finding answers.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My research started quite some time ago, I have a strong concept and am well prepared. As it is difficult to foresee what will happen or not and how exactly it looks like eventually, I don't want to be too detailed about the concept at this point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to create content that can be published and exhibited, I think it is important to create more attention and a discussion to be able to change this horrible situation.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Why Indiegogo and what you can do</h3>
I financed this whole trip in advance with my own money, so I am independent, what is very important for my work. I decided to start a campaign here to see if I can speed up the work after I am back from South Africa: Film has to be developed and scanned, pictures have to be edited and worked on. Text has to be written, proofread, maybe translated. Different parts of content need to be linked and connected. So a big part of the work actually happens after the content is produced. The money I raise now will push that process, I will be able to see results much quicker. Also I can decide to produce more content or shoot more on film than digitally.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will shoot footage for a picture-diary to document my trip. These pictures will be the base for the perks. You can buy prints from that picture diary. I will shoot analog and digital, colour as well as black and white.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The images will be a surprise for all of us, as they have not been made yet, and they will show you my Johannesburg experience. If you buy a print it doesn't only support this work financially but also shows me that you trust in my work and I appreciate that a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't afford to buy a print you are of course invited to look at my online diary, spread the word, ask me questions about this project or support me in whatever other way you want!</p>

Hi my name is Joshua Gordon I am currently a Photography Student at Tunxis Community College in Farmington, CT, graduating in the Spring of 2012. Come this fall I will be flying out to Israel to take part in Oranim's ""Tel Aviv Internship Experience"" Living in Tel Aviv for Six Months while working at a Photography Studio. While working on a Photo Essay of ""The Children of Israel""


Why I Want to Take Part in the ""Tel Aviv Internship Experience"" 

In the Winter of 08, 09 I took part in Taglit-Birthright Israel. The experience I had was Incredible. When I got back to the States I could not wait to return. I began looking for post birthright programs on MASA ISRAEL. I found Oranim's ""Tel Aviv Internship Experience"", thinking it would be the perfect fit for me. Living in the land that I love, while launching my career in photography.  Working on on the Photo Essay ""The Children of Israel"", witch I intended to self publish and have display in small and local galleries in The States when I return. 


My Work as a Photographer and My Photo Essay ""The Children of Israel"" 
My work as a photographer goes from traditional commercial and fashion photography to incredible original pieces of art. My work is both still life and portraits, capturing them  as if they were film stills.  Please take a look at my Portfolio 

For ""The Children of Israel"" I would be photographing the many different people of Israel. Breaking down the stereotypes, by telling their story in a portrait. When I first went to Israel I discover this meeting all types of people, all of whom have a great story to tell. Although I work in both still life, commercial, studio portrait, and environmental portraits. My love is for environmental portraits; to be able to get great emanations out of people with just a look, and sometimes a simple prop.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>Afterschoolgirls </i>is a Japanese gravure inspired photobook, and is a tribute to Japanese schoolgirl culture. I've been photographing schoolgirl themes for over a year and curated my favorite photos into this collection.</p>
<p>Right now, <i>Afterschoolgirls</i> is only a digital layout. Besides being a photographer, I'm a professional graphic designer who works in print, so it would be a shame to not have a physical copy of my passion project photobook!</p>
<p>If I were to print a few copies of <i>Afterschoolgirls</i> for myself, it would be unreasonably expensive. For those who aren't familiar with the print industry, costs drop drastically when more copies of the same thing are printed at one time. That is why I created this campaign, so I can print more books and share the costs, along with the benefits, with the supporters!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">I've already contributed my own time and money to get this passion project to where it is now. The photoshoots are in the bag, the layout is complete, and the book is ready for the press! So don't worry about your contribution being wasted on things like research or development; your funds will go directly towards getting <i>Afterschoolgirls</i> into your hands!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But fair warning: Since it is a fixed goal, all contributions will be refunded if the minimum funds are not raised. Unfortunately, that means the photobook will not get printed and none of the rewards will be sent out. I chose to go with a fixed campaign because I rather not receive backers' contributions without giving them a physical copy of the photobook in return.</p>
</div></div>","Afterschoolgirls is a Japanese gravure inspired photobook, and is a tribute to Japanese schoolgirl culture. I've been photographing schoolgirl themes for over a year and curated my favorite photos into this collection.
Right now, Afterschoolgirls is only a digital layout. Besides being a photographer, I'm a professional graphic designer who works in print, so it would be a shame to not have a physical copy of my passion project photobook!

That is why I created this campaign, so I can print more books and share the costs, along with the benefits, with the supporters!
This campaign, with a modest goal, will fund the professional printing of Afterschoolgirls so that others, who also appreciate Japanese schoolgirl culture, can have their own tangible copy of the book. So if you are as passionate about schoolgirls, photography and bookmaking as I am, please support this endeavor!
 

Here's a quick rundown of the Afterschoolgirls photobook:


7x10"" softcover
32 full color pages + cover
59 photos
15 exclusive photos
8 featured schoolgirls
15 outfits

To get your own copy of the book, back the campaign through one of the various perks! But don't delay, this crowdfunding campaign will be the only opportunity to get a copy of Afterschoolgirls! I'm not planning on re-printing the book! 
Exclusive PhotosYou may have seen some Afterschoolgirls photos on Instagram that the models and I have posted, but I've saved the best shots for the book! 15 out of the 59 photos are book exclusive and no one other than the models and I have seen them.

Perk BundlesYou can go with the Back to School or Early Enrollment perks to pick up a photobook, but you can also get the book with a couple of prints through one of the themed perks at a great price!
The Wholesome Homeroom perk includes wholesome, yet cute, portraits of Zekia and 卵 (Tamago). Pretend that Zekia is handing you her confession!
Leap Through Time is a special perk that comes with prints from photosets not featured in the book, but will be in the next one. The two prints are of Rabbittrixs and Tsikyo. Unfortunately there wasn't time or room to include Tsikyo in the first photobook, so I'm offering a print of her to make up for it!
If you're a fan of Miso Tokki, then Spicy MIso is your perk! It comes with a print from our iconic strawberry sailor uniform set and a print from the popular blue PE uniform set! There is also the Maximum Miso, an upgraded version of the bundle, that includes a custom Instax photo of Miso Tokki in a schoolgirl related outfit, and with your choice of pose! They're limited so get one while they're available!
The Honor Roll perk includes the book and all six of the prints in one bundle! It's also the most cost effective way to get every print!
The ほ Package is a special perk that will complete the campaign with one contribution! This is the most comprehensive bundle, and also the most ridiculous, but if you feel inclined, then choose this one of a kind perk!
 

Although it isn't necessary, additional funding would greatly help the campaign! The first amount of extra funds will go towards upgrading Afterschoolgirls with better/thicker paper stock.
I'd also like to print copies for the models who graciously contributed to the project. The shoots were trade-for-print (TFP) so it would be nice to give a little more back to them.
Any funds beyond this will go towards the next volume of Afterschoolgirls. It'll help offset future photoshoot costs like studio rental, transportation, purchasing outfits/props, and many other expenses.

$2000 - Exclusive Afterschoolgirls vinyl stickers!Every backer, who contributed $20 or more, will receive a sticker illustrated by James Valle (@kentaropjj) exclusively for Afterschoolgirls! James is a friend who happens to be an amazing artist. You may have seen his work at comic and anime convention artist alleys . These will be high quality scratch, sun, and waterproof clear vinyl stickers about 2x3"" in size. Put them on your car, laptop, or water bottle to show the world your appreciation for schoolgirls!

 

Afterschoolgirls wouldn't be possible without the talented models that fill its pages. Like me, these girls originated from the cosplay community, and share an interested in Japanese schoolgirl culture. I'd like to introduce you to these talented cosplayers, models, artists, creatives, and influencers:
Cat - From the blue beaches of SoCal to the pink sakura canopies of Japan; our schoolgirl photoshoots have taken us to some fantastic locations across the world!
Hanakima - An expert cosplayer, model, and seamstress; she's the full package!
Miso Tokki - She doesn't fit in any of the Asian sized schoolgirl outfits we get for the photoshoots, but she sure looks good in them!
오유진 (Oh Yujin) - A talented fine artist, who cosplays and models!
Rabbittrixs - A long-time friend who shares similar interests in Japanese culture. She's always up for interesting schoolgirl photoshoots!
卵 (Tamago) - According to her, she's into lewd themed cosplays, and that is why we're friends and enjoy working together!
Tia - A cosplayer and professional fashion designer. She and Cat are friends and make a great schoolgirl pair!
Zekia - She oozes with wholesome schoolgirl! I'm so happy that she's part of the project, making it a more rounded photobook!

Transfer Student Tsikyo - One of the nicest cosplayers I know! We met during an anime convention when I tried to plan a shoot with her. At first her schedule was too packed to shoot,  but the next day she DMed me back and asked if I wanted to do a schoolgirl PE uniform shoot!
 

September 16 - Campaign Launch!

All perks will be available.

Early Enrollment will be available until quantities or time runs out.

 
During the Campaign

I'll continue going over and refining the photobook until I'm 100% satisfied with the design and layout.
I've looked into a handful of online printers. One will be chosen and contacted about the photobook order.
I'll look into where to print the school portrait rewards.
If/when the contributions are nearing the sticker stretch goal: I'll coordinate with the artist on the design.

 
⁠October 11 - Campaign Ends (25 days)Depending on interest, I may extend the end date.
If the campaign ends successfully:

I'll put in the order for the photobooks and the school portrait prints.
Photobook will be proofed to make sure nothing goes wrong.
If things go smoothly, photobooks should be completed in two to three weeks, and prints should be ready well before then.


After rewards are printed, they'll be signed by the schoolgirls.
If stretch goals are met:
Keep an eye on social media for book exclusive photos!
If perk upgrade goals are reached: I'll announce the winners and contact them.
If the sticker goal is reached: I'll send out the order for the stickers.



 
Early November
Hopefully all the rewards will be ready and shipped out to backers!




I've already contributed my own time and money to get this passion project to where it is now. The photoshoots are in the bag, the layout is complete, and the book is ready for the press! So don't worry about your contribution being wasted on things like research or development; your funds will go directly towards getting Afterschoolgirls into your hands!
But fair warning: Since it is a fixed goal, all contributions will be refunded if the minimum funds are not raised. Unfortunately, that means the photobook will not get printed and none of the rewards will be sent out. I chose to go with a fixed campaign because I rather not receive backers' contributions without giving them a physical copy of the photobook in return.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Il mondo è un luogo magico e vogliamo mostrarvelo.</p>
<p>Kokparbrothers è un team che riunisce due appassionati di vita, viaggi, avventure e, soprattutto, fotografia e video.</p>
<p>Ci definiamo fratelli che condividono la stessa sensibilità e gli stessi interessi. Ognuno ha un talento diverso, personalità diverse, ma siamo uniti da grande affetto reciproco e passione, siamo nel cuore ""brothers"". Ognuno ha la propria storia e i propri obiettivi, il proprio impegno verso se stesso e per la squadra.</p>
<p>Insieme abbiamo deciso di partecipare al Mongol Rally2019, un viaggio che ci porterà attraverso 26 paesi, per 18.000 km, a bordo di una FIAT 500.</p>
<p>Vogliamo ritrarre questo cammino, dalla terra e dal cielo: 60 giorni sulle rotte carovaniere della Via della Seta mostrando al mondo le culture e i luoghi.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Il Mongol Rally è un rally non competitivo che ha principalmente scopo benefico.</p>
<p>Vogliamo quindi che il nostro viaggio e la nostra professionalità fotografica si uniscano per realizzare un libro di immagini e racconti.</p>
<p>La realizzazione del libro ci permetterà di dare un valore visuale al contributo che doneremo alle ONG, di ringraziare con un oggetto tangibile i nostri sostenitori e di avere memoria con la bellezza di un'avventura che è dono per noi e per gli altri.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Il viaggio, che dura due mesi e mezzo, sarà sicuramente ricco di meraviglie, ma ci riserverà qualche rischio. Non è un viaggio semplice: le regole impongono un percorso libero ma anche di viaggiare su un mezzo poco potente, senza l'aiuto di navigatori o di tecnologie moderne. Un viaggio alla vecchia maniera, cartina e bussola alla mano, niente autostrade, nessun privilegio, nessuna assistenza. Ci stiamo preparando da un anno agli imprevisti e faremo in modo che tutti possano seguirci attraverso i canali social ma anche con interviste radio e dirette.</p>
<p>Vogliamo che ci sia dialogo e interazione in tempo reale con tutti coloro che seguiranno la nostra avventura. Sarà appassionante accompagnarci con una presenza virtuale nelle nostre sfide quotidiane e si potrà avere un assaggio dell'atmosfera che vogliamo includere nel libro.</p>
