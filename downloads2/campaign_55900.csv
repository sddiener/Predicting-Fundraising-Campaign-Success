<p>Remote free experience with your AC!</p>
<p>It's 2020, and sometimes we still wake up in the middle of the night because the room temperature is not suitable, sometimes it is too hot, and too cold other times. This urge us to develop a solution that not only senses the temperature and humidity, but also the ability to control any IR-controlled AC, to avoid discomfort during sleep (which is so tired).</p>
<p>Also, we don't want our users to buy a whole devices with any AC in their homes, therefore we split the device into 2 parts to reduce the cost user have to pay per AC:</p>
<p>The hub: plugged &amp; connected to the wifi, in charge for calculating ""optimal feels like temperature"", and generating AC controlling command.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591751663/gk0z3cxdn1jon0gkoesf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The spoke: battery powered, in charge for sensing room temperature, humidity, light &amp; send IR signal to the AC following command received from the hub. Also, with IR receiver integrated, the spoke can also recorded how user control the AC with the remote controller, saving historical data to create personalized preferable temperature.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591751679/uymvkg1dxajpktark1rn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Though more experiments are required, we expect to be able to detect ""abnormal environmental changes"" through room temperature changes, like a window or door open, then notify users to avoid wasted energy. </p>
<p>And from financial view, with akaCoola, we aim to create a device that have reasonable prices, deliver faster ROI, and supporting our users in saving money on energy bills.</p>
<p>So, better sleep experience, remote free, and saving energy bills. These are our goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Where we are right now</strong></h3>
<p>We started since mid 2019. In Dec, the first version was completed, we test, and found out problems in IR compatibility, together with issues in BLE ICU.</p>
<p>In March 2020, 20 sets of hub and spoke 2nd version was completed, they are running in a school dorm at this moment. we expect the field test to be completed in next 3 months, in a total 6 months field tests</p>
<p>It costed us around 30000 USD to this point, and to have the final version be ready for shipping, we estimate around 20000 plus device manufacturing costs. </p>
<h3><strong>What is the biggest challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Is should be how the team lack of experiences in designing a completed products, especially in hardware. We were able to finish the mobile app and setting up the IoT platform on cloud pretty quickly in just 2 months, but for the hardware, we made a lot of mistakes in designing the board, choosing the ICU, and put them together for a long run.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have support from professors of University of Technology and Education Ho Chi Minh city, from design, test equipment to 3D printer, and reviewing the board.</p>
<h3><strong>So </strong></h3>
<p>better sleep experience, remote free, and saving energy bills. These are our goals.</p>

This urge us to develop a solution that not only senses the temperature and humidity, but also the ability to control any IR-controlled AC, to avoid discomfort during sleep (which is so tired).
Also, we don't want our users to buy a whole devices with any AC in their homes, therefore we split the device into 2 parts to reduce the cost user have to pay per AC:
The hub: plugged & connected to the wifi, in charge for calculating ""optimal feels like temperature"", and generating AC controlling command.

The spoke: battery powered, in charge for sensing room temperature, humidity, light & send IR signal to the AC following command received from the hub. Also, with IR receiver integrated, the spoke can also recorded how user control the AC with the remote controller, saving historical data to create personalized preferable temperature.

Though more experiments are required, we expect to be able to detect ""abnormal environmental changes"" through room temperature changes, like a window or door open, then notify users to avoid wasted energy. 
And from financial view, with akaCoola, we aim to create a device that have reasonable prices, deliver faster ROI, and supporting our users in saving money on energy bills.
So, better sleep experience, remote free, and saving energy bills. These are our goals.
Where we are right now
We started since mid 2019. In Dec, the first version was completed, we test, and found out problems in IR compatibility, together with issues in BLE ICU.
In March 2020, 20 sets of hub and spoke 2nd version was completed, they are running in a school dorm at this moment. we expect the field test to be completed in next 3 months, in a total 6 months field tests
It costed us around 30000 USD to this point, and to have the final version be ready for shipping, we estimate around 20000 plus device manufacturing costs. 
What is the biggest challenges
Is should be how the team lack of experiences in designing a completed products, especially in hardware. We were able to finish the mobile app and setting up the IoT platform on cloud pretty quickly in just 2 months, but for the hardware, we made a lot of mistakes in designing the board, choosing the ICU, and put them together for a long run.
Fortunately, we have support from professors of University of Technology and Education Ho Chi Minh city, from design, test equipment to 3D printer, and reviewing the board.
So 
better sleep experience, remote free, and saving energy bills. These are our goals.

In just 3 minutes, a bottle of homemade natural disinfection solution is ready to use. It's that simple!Enpuly is integrated with an electrolyzer to produce the electrolysis of tap water and table salt, resulting in the product of hypochlorous acid and hydroxide.The Electrolytic brine generates chlorine gas, which dissolves in the water and produces sodium hydroxide in the solution. The solution from the electrolysis process is called EOW/ electrolyzed oxidation water.                       EOW is a powerful disinfectant that is safe for humans, animals, food, and surfaces. Hydroxide radicals are commonly found in cleaning detergents, and hypochlorous acid kills all kinds of micro bacteria, fungi, and germs.According to chemists and scientists, the concentration of hydroxide radicals in our EOW is lower than any other cleaning detergents in the market. In other words, Enpuly's EOW is safer and more effective at killing all harmful germs and bacteria that are present in your home and wherever you go. Only one Enpuly disinfectant spray bottle replaces all other cleaners to clean all germs and bacteria that human eyes cannot see.Germs Hot SpotsGerms and bacteria live on surfaces such as carpets, sofas and bed linen, with which one comes into daily contact. Statistics show that about 27% of toilet seats are contaminated with mold and yeast, and the bathroom is one of the germ's most popular party places. About 45% of kitchen sink tested positive for coliform bacteria, while 27% contained molds.

The cooling section protects testicles and inner thighs from contact, while the intimate parts stay naturally relaxed and physically comfortable.

<p>Side membrane mesh boosts  airflow and  due to  innate  body movements, even  while resting,  there  is continuous air circulation in the section, providing coolness and moisture control. The combination of two high-end tech fibers stops the increase of testicular temperature. Up to 90% of far infrared rays, also known as body heat, are being transferred, which promotes blood circulation and thermoregulation. Mineral  content in  tech fibers controls  humidity,  keeps  testicles  dry  and  eliminates  body  odors.<br/>The body of the underwear is made of high quality combed cotton for natural experience and freedom of movement.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Did you know that testicles should always be cooler than other parts of your intimate area?<br/>Your body is designed to keep the testes cooler than regular body temp: that's why they hang outside your body...The warmer environment, the lower they want to hang, but when its real cold they hike up. The sweat glands are there to further lower temps by evaporation - the same reason you sweat in other places. <br/>Testicles are the sperm keepers. Sperm are finely crafted little baby making machines. They require a precise environment, 3 to 4 degrees cooler than body temperature. That is why they are ""separated"" in testicles outside the body. If sperm are exposed to elevated temperatures, they begin to die. This will show up on a semen analysis as reduced mobility. If the exposure to heat is prolonged, it can affect sperm production processes, causing the body to produce fewer sperm, many of which may be abnormally shaped.</span></p>

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">We are sure that you all have friends who are struggling to have a baby. Help us fight one of the biggest problems of the modern world - the decreasing male fertility. There are so many couples all around the world whose only dream is to have a child. 
<p>Let's make it together! Help us spread our mission!</p>
<p>Boxair has already come to life. For the time being we were able to pay for the design and manufacture of the first bulk, as well as the branding and advertising concept. We have the ready product, the website, the packaging and the advertising materials. Now it is time to introduce Boxair to the world, but we are out of steam. We don not have the money to promote our product to potential distributors and clients at the most influential underwear international shows - MODE CITY Lyon, France and CURVE in Las Vegas, USA.</p>
<p>If you help us raise  20 000 USD,  we will be able to exhibit at the above mentioned fairs and  to promote our product to more distributors, boutiques, chain stores and agents. Thus more people will learn about Boxair and will benefit from its health promoting characteristics in regard to mens' fertility and health.</p>
<p>We will spend the money for exhibition fees, transportation, logistics, accommodation, hiring a model, etc. More than half of the money goes for the exhibition fees, e.g - a small 30 sq.ft.(10 sq.m.) stand at the fair costs about 6000 USD. If we succeed to raise more than the pledged amount we will rent a bigger stand and will be more attractive.

<div></div></div>","Boxair is a truly innovative product for men with unmatched health-promoting benefits. 
Boxair brings the category of men's underwear to a new level by introducing a product that is not only comfortable, stylish and of highest quality but also cares for men's reproductive and sexual health  and serves as a natural  fertility aid. 
The combination of high-tech and organic fabrics and patented structure reproduce the useful effect of the underwear -  to protect the intimate zone from overheating and excessive sweating. The patented anatomic design follows body curves and high-tech materials create healthy and natural environment that allows your skin to breathe. 
















The specially  designed cooling  section of the underwear  consists  of two  different tech fibers, which optimize  air  circulation and  improve  thermodynamics  of the intimate zone.  Nano-crystals  treatment  and  cross-section structure of fibers create draining system that pulls moisture away from the skin to the outer layer of the fabric. The cooling section protects testicles and inner thighs from contact, while the intimate parts stay naturally relaxed and physically comfortable. The side panels are constructed to follow the anatomic curves of men's body and delicately shape  the intimate area without putting pressure and tension.
 






Side membrane mesh boosts  airflow and  due to  innate  body movements, even  while resting,  there  is continuous air circulation in the section, providing coolness and moisture control. The combination of two high-end tech fibers stops the increase of testicular temperature. Up to 90% of far infrared rays, also known as body heat, are being transferred, which promotes blood circulation and thermoregulation. Mineral  content in  tech fibers controls  humidity,  keeps  testicles  dry  and  eliminates  body  odors.The body of the underwear is made of high quality combed cotton for natural experience and freedom of movement.




    




Boxair is not just underwear.Boxair is a proactive step towards everyday care and prevention. Its innovative features determine the benefits of its daily use.








 




When choosing from our perks, don't miss to check the size chart.










We rarely talk about it but...numbers talk instead...World map containing percentages of infertility cases per region that are due to male factor. This figure demonstrates rates of infertility cases in each region studied (North America, Latin America, Africa, Europe, Central/Eastern Europe, Middle East.

Heat is among the top causes of reduced fertility in men. The sources of heat to the family jewels range from tighty whities to laptops, fevers or anatomy issues. All of these things can actually impact your fertility. 



No one is protected.

Did you know that testicles should always be cooler than other parts of your intimate area?Your body is designed to keep the testes cooler than regular body temp: that's why they hang outside your body...The warmer environment, the lower they want to hang, but when its real cold they hike up. The sweat glands are there to further lower temps by evaporation - the same reason you sweat in other places. Testicles are the sperm keepers. Sperm are finely crafted little baby making machines. They require a precise environment, 3 to 4 degrees cooler than body temperature. That is why they are ""separated"" in testicles outside the body. If sperm are exposed to elevated temperatures, they begin to die. This will show up on a semen analysis as reduced mobility. If the exposure to heat is prolonged, it can affect sperm production processes, causing the body to produce fewer sperm, many of which may be abnormally shaped.
Here are some of the most common heat sources:
Environmental Sources

• Cooking• Grilling• Motorcycles• Hottubs• Saunas• Laptops• Cell phones• Tight-fitting clothing• CyclingPhysiological Sources
• Varicocele• Undecended / late decended testicle• Obesity (scrotal fat)• Fever






We are sure that you all have friends who are struggling to have a baby. Help us fight one of the biggest problems of the modern world - the decreasing male fertility. There are so many couples all around the world whose only dream is to have a child. 
Let's make it together! Help us spread our mission!
Boxair has already come to life. For the time being we were able to pay for the design and manufacture of the first bulk, as well as the branding and advertising concept. We have the ready product, the website, the packaging and the advertising materials. Now it is time to introduce Boxair to the world, but we are out of steam. We don not have the money to promote our product to potential distributors and clients at the most influential underwear international shows - MODE CITY Lyon, France and CURVE in Las Vegas, USA.
If you help us raise  20 000 USD,  we will be able to exhibit at the above mentioned fairs and  to promote our product to more distributors, boutiques, chain stores and agents. Thus more people will learn about Boxair and will benefit from its health promoting characteristics in regard to mens' fertility and health.
We will spend the money for exhibition fees, transportation, logistics, accommodation, hiring a model, etc. More than half of the money goes for the exhibition fees, e.g - a small 30 sq.ft.(10 sq.m.) stand at the fair costs about 6000 USD. If we succeed to raise more than the pledged amount we will rent a bigger stand and will be more attractive. If we can not reach the target of 20 000 USD, we will only take part in one of the shows, which  will  probably greatly decrease our chances, but nonetheless we will do it. 
You can also help us by spreading the word for our campaign and product. Sharing this campaign with your friends and acquaintances will also help us a great deal.

 out of periods of regression and remission throughout my university

30 years on there is no progress with the treatment of inflammatory

 protocol is still many medications and surgeries that have high levels 
of side effects yet still not reversing the disease process! The top 
gastroenterologist are still saying the same thing as they were saying 
30 years ago; Inflammatory bowel disease(IBD) namely Uncreative Colitis

Never?! Having generally put once the appropriate settings we forget about setup! Because it isn't convenient and takes time away! And at the same time we absolutely forget how it affects us.EYE-SAVE was born from personal disappointment in recent developments in this sphere. It has induced us to create the simple solution suitable practically for all models of computers.  Lightweight, durable and rather small.EYE-SAVE – the external device that can be connected to the computer and easily attached to any surface. Will be equipped USB and Wi-Fi  and compatible with the basic operating systems. Nowadays the existing research don't allow to adjust automatically the screen settings (on the created dependency (profile) for regulation and comfortable operating), some change the screen temperature, as a result it seems uncomfortable. And if to take into account the five - ten years old computers and monitors the situation is absolutely sadly in the absence of any similar systems. Communicating with different people and friends, we came to the conclusion that it is the main problem, setup inconvenience and regular monitors settings.Our team developed EYE-SAVE which are reduces the unpleasant symptoms associated with eye strain, makes interaction more convenient and comfortable, allows adjusting automatically the monitor luminosity in accordance the external illumination thereby reducing exhaustion of eyes. Scientists report, that up to 90% of the information people receive through vision. Statistics shows that a huge number of people spends more and more time at the computer. For example, experts from the USA have warned about the risk of reduced quality of vision in a rapidly developing digital age.If you spend more than 2-3 hours in front of a monitor you have a 90% chance of developing digital eye strain, it is dangerous and can cause development of the disease or visual loss. Many of us spend hours looking at the monitor screen, and a way of life without action is fraught with a lot of health hazards, especially from childhood! Proper lighting and optimal settings of your monitor – this is one of the most essential recommendations for reducing eye strain when working at the computer. Different studies confirm that it turns our eyes get very tired when they have to peer at the dim monitor in bright sunlight, or, conversely, staring at a dazzling spot monitor in the dark, later this can affect the overall fatigue of the body , headaches, blindness. That is by changing the external lighting you need to modify the luminosity of screen and take breaks more often. Few people know that, that it's possible the lighting should be natural, any artificial lights are not enough friendly view and subsequently tires. We offer the system which will undertake these functions, will make for eyes more favorable conditions for work at any time thereby will rid you of changing the screen parameters and as a result will keep the eyesight after the long using. EYE-SAVE will be very useful for all who spends a lot of time at the computer more than 2 hours a day. Setup will take less than 10 minutes. Easy connection and setup in 3 steps: 
Connect the device 
Launch the program on the computer 
Enjoy working, use manual, training or automatic modes 
When you work at the computer and feel eye irritation, simple adjust settings by quick keys (manual or training mode),system will remember the configuration and subsequently will adjust all parameters automatically (automatic mode)! The software has less than 1% consumption of CPU resources and device has very low power consumption about 120mA ! Real green tree !We really wondered why this type of product does not exist yet. So we decided that if nobody else is going to do is we're going to give him a lucky chance. The device is a PCB with a microcontroller, a digital sensor, USB adapter and WiFi module . Powered via a micro-USB port on the computer or an external power supply when transferring data over WiFi. So, you can't set something wrong.Base software allows you to control the device, setup the communication parameters, quick keys. The first version will be equipped with the basic control program and a USB support, but now we are working on additional options like WiFi, allowing the device to operate with multiple computers at the same time and more interesting to control the system and additional features listed below.Some users already test working EYE-SAVE and according to reviews all are satisfied with result.The software will continue to improve for expand additional features, the graphical display of the profile and the additional subtle settings etc. The plan is to develop a software module, to introduce functions of timers, reminders of a possible fatigue, which inform that it is time to escape for awhile, to make a longer break or will tell you that you have exceeded the limit of daily work at the computer, information about excess or insufficient lighting.The system will deprived of false operations, works adequately changeable illumination, it will possible to set delay and limits functions!  Development of WiFi support would allow convenient to use EYE-SAVE for home, office or a whole class with multiple computers, and each will have its own lighting profile.This is only the beginning as the project is to gaining strength! We were looking for a solution to make a modern design. We also tried to make EYE-SAVE as small and lightweight that it can clip it on any surface.A prototype printed on a modern 3D printer is great, it looks close to ideal, but the final version will be completely transparent and look even cool!   KratX squad is engaged in development of electronic devices, computer software and services. After the origin of idea, we estimated the elaborations though somehow connected to our idea and dare to make the ready decision which will help many people to keep eyesight. This project brought us together and we decided to combine our efforts and try crowdfunding platform Indiegogo as a funding source. EYE-SAVE command is, of course, more, includes managers for the supply of electronics, components and partners associated with the production of the enclosures that operate in Asia as well as other engineers and designers on packaging, advertising etc. From our history you see that we have been working throughout the year to make the world acquainted with our system. We developed the concept, working prototypes and proved that this technology is very useful. We know how important to fulfill our promise to all our backers and deliver on time EYE-SAVE. We have done all we can to prepare for production and we are ready as soon as we hit our target funding. Regardless of a result we will be engaged in our project, achievement of our financial purposes will accelerate all processes on development.We understand that there are risks with delivery of our product in time remaining within our budget frames for the development. First deliveries of the EYE-SAVE devices we are planning in May 2017. We have established partnerships with manufacturers in Taiwan and China, with many years of experience with electronics and components and are ready to start mass production. To reduce these risks, we regularly conduct negotiations with our business partners to guarantee that we adhere to the schedule and that the production process will be corresponds to the declared quality.To make EYE-SAVE available, we shall estimate tens of options for each component and negotiate prices per item with tens of producers. We now know the exact number of units that we will be releasing our first batch, and who will be the suppliers of each component, as the agreed delivery terms and conditions. We understand, there were cases of the product delays but we will try not to let it happen in our project. We have a plan to process completely our own production and we counted that we need take up about $ 208K , we are ready to develop the project, but we need your help to make EYE-SAVE more accessible for people and, ultimately, more to help people preserve vision. To keep low prices, we need to be involved at every stage of production, from cables and packaging. Donations will be used to finance:purchase of material for molding housings // manufacture of molds/ manufacture enclosures // manufacture PCB (all-in-one) // assembly electronics and enclosures in device // inspection and quality control // the final packaging design, printing, manufacturing // shipping // logistics// branding communication and PR// risks of the product and financial // support and documentation // HR Management and project Management // purchase of additional parts// the development and updating of firmware, software . We also need to finance the international certification UL, FCC,CE (EMC) of the device, which is a very important step to ensure the product is safe and legally ready for distribution in US, EU and other countries. With your generous support we can make this a high quality product as possible. We are so grateful to everyone who has taken the time to read our campaign. Help us to bring EYE-SAVE to health life! We have produced several different versions in the evolution of the device and was not observed in the work of any critical problems associated with electronics. Of course for large parties will control the quality of each device. With regard to software and firmware, if such are detected , they will be corrected and upgraded to new versions of the software \ firmware. Before the Indiegogo, we are prepared for production devices and has signed agreements for supply of components, housings and assembly. Developed final 3D model of the mold housings.Production and delivery in time is another key point. We cooperate with experienced and responsible companies that care about production plan and entire supply chain.The production plan drawn up with risks, so it has some time delay. We make the realistic purposes of financing which will allow us to make enough items for achievement of scale effect and increase in profitability, providing at the same time the posted price.If you have any questions, we will be fully transparent and to communicate to all of our backers What will the EYE-SAVE cost?During the Indiegogo campaign, early supporters will be able to purchase EYE-SAVE for as low as $56. After the campaign, the EYE-SAVE will retail from ~$79.  My TV set has USB, can I connect EYE-SAVE directly to it? No! A desktop operating system of Windows, Linux and (OS-X soon) is necessary to install the EYE-SAVE .  What is the Length of the USB cable?We understand that computers are different and that the device was easy to connect to any of them we decided to put 2 m cable ! What is the WiFi range of my EYE-SAVE?EYE-SAVE will works up to 100-150 feet (30-50 meters) away to Wi-Fi router.  What diagonals is your device for? Our system works with any diagonals of the screens  How many EYE-SAVE do I need for several computers in the room? If the device is USB how computers have many devices. If a device with Wi-Fi you only need 1 device to manage a class of computers, even on different operating systems.  How can I specify the delivery terms? When we have the first EYE-SAVE lot to ship and we come to definite shipment conditions with logistic companies we will send a survey to all backers. With this form you'll be able to do next: 
• to specify delivery address
• to remind us of any special arrangements if such have place between us
• to ask your quesions and to express any additional preferences on documentation, customs or taxes.  Where to send? We use all major courier/postal company will deliver worldwide.  What is “WiFi- soft upgradable option”? All devices will compatible with Wi-Fi support, when you purchase an upgrade , you can update software to WiFi from our cite, and use it wireless too. But you'll need a power supply with a micro USB for example from your phone, or just buy a we have EYE-SAVE type “B” package.  Why did EYE-SAVE choose a flexible campaign funding plan? Flexible campaigns allow for a more payment choices by backers. We wanted everyone to be able to buy EYE-SAVE. Whether you want to use PayPal or your credit card, you can get your EYE-SAVE from here.  Is there a guarantee on the EYE-SAVE? Yes, the EYE-SAVE comes with a one year warranty.

<p> </p>
<p>Three years ago, sitting in a neurobiology lab in Kansas City, our founder was puzzling over a problem he couldn't solve:  Why, he wondered, were the major sports industries not doing more to prevent and protect their athletes from traumatic brain injuries(TBI)? </p>
<p>Pick up any standard football helmet today and you’ll find some key similarities: lots of padding, heavy construction, with the goal to keep your brain safe.  The way we see it, the problem is that each player that arrives on the field is different than the one next to them.  They have different histories, experience levels and most importantly, body sizes and age.<br/> </p>
<p>Right now the CDC estimates that 1% of the US population suffers from concussions or some form of traumatic head injury (TBI) every year.  <strong>That's almost 4 MILLION people!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476821847/nl7ftjhsiobai6hd1guc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<div>
<p>We strongly believe that we need to do away with the one-size-fits-all thinking about concussion prevention.</p>
<p><strong>Think about it this way: </strong>A child is going to experience impact differently than an NFL linebacker. By learning <i><strong>who</strong></i><strong> </strong>is wearing the helmet, the sensor we're developing can predict when an impact force is going to potentially hurt the wearer and send a warning signal via Bluetooth to a smart phone or other enabled device.</p>
<p>This helps you as a parent or coach to make decisions on providing care and prevent further injuries.  </p>
<p>A sensor is only as smart as the data it receives.  In order to build a smart sensor, we need to  get them in the hands and on the heads of as many people as possible to help us collect this valuable data.  <strong>Artificial intelligence relies on learning from large amounts of accumulated data from various of sources. And we are asking <i>YOU </i>to be our source​.</strong></p>
<p>Our sensor is currently meant for <strong>anyone who considers themselves active </strong>to wear it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476819143/pjnwbm4v8tmf2qaznf41.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A few of our features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Issues a warning signal should you encounter a potentially dangerous head impact (such as a fall or a collision). </li>
<li>Reminds you to upload the data on a regular basis to our server so that we can analyze the data and let you know (should you opt in) if a particular impact is serious enough or not that you should take it easy or if you can get back in the game.  </li>
</ul>
<p>And because we take into account who you are as an active person, you can rest assured that the feedback you receive will accurate, tailored and unique to you. This separates us from the other ""single-threshold"" sensors on the market. <strong>Where they use a one-size fits all approach, we offer a custom profile of what your body can and cannot handle. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the business side of things, we're asking for $75,000.00 to disrupt the world of youth sports and concussion prevention.</p>
<p>These funds will not only allow us to make our sensors smaller and more powerful but it will also allow us to begin the crucial Phase II development of our smart helmet.</p>
<p>The sooner we can accomplish these things, the sooner  we can begin our field testing phase and get our integrated, active helmets into the hands of youth football teams for testing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The bottom line is that preventing a concussion is a far better approach than attempting to fix the brain <i>after </i>a concussion.</strong> Our goal is to reduce the risk of a concussion with our integrated active helmet system.</p>
<p>We literally can't do this without  you--to be able to reach our full potential we are going to need serious investment dollars. Investors generally like to fund things that have been proven to make a difference in the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>And so we're asking you to help us</strong>. Show the world that you're serious about concussion prevention and make our vision a reality.</p>

<p>The Center for Disease Control estimates that 1% of the US population suffers from concussions or some form of traumatic head injury (TBI) every year.  </p>
<p><strong>Out of those, as many as 1.5 million children incur sports or recreation related concussions. (This is based on the June ""Pediatrics"" journal article from 2016). </strong></p>
<p>Concussions can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has no cure and can accelerate brain aging by ~300%.  Furthermore, concussions in children severely reduce brain metabolism, interfere with overall brain development and are therefore all the more devastating. </p>
<p>There are countless stories from parents whose children have suffered concussions and who are now closely monitoring their success at college, in the work force and other critical turning points in their lives. </p>
<p>When it comes to the relationship between concussions and CTE, the scientific community is divided. Some believe that it only takes <b>one concussion</b> to cause serious brain trauma and increase the risk of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy ). Others believe that it may take repeated head injuries. Either way, the odds are bad.</p>
<p>Our brain is literally our most valuable asset. Step up and take action to protect it and make a safer, healthier future a reality.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Challenges:</h3>
<p><b>Ongoing Software Development: </b>As with any technology product, we will be continuously working on refining our code, working on our data analysis and updating our app to be as user-friendly and useful as possible. We are also continuing to pursue better PCB manufacturing options to streamline the look and feel of the sensor for future iterations.</p>
<p><b>Helmet Manufacturing: </b>While our vision is to create the first integrated helmet/sensor system, we recognize the level of work yet to be done on this front. We have to find and build a relationship with a physical goods manufacturer and ensure a long-tail supply chain for any future development. We are also still in the early stages of mechanical development. To date, We have fabricated and tested several iterations of prototypes in our own lab and the lab of our independent collaborators at several university laboratories.   While these prototypes can only be worn by our lab dummies, our preliminary results are promising and show that we can reduce a significant amount of impact energy.</p>
<p><strong>Field Testing and Adoption: </strong>The first thing most companies learn is that change is hard. And we are pushing for a lot of change. Change in the way we think about concussions and more importantly, change in the way people protect their most valuable asset. We are confident based on our current conversations with local area football teams and high schools that we can proceed with our field testing once we have our initial helmet prototype done, but long-term adoption is going to take a village.</p>
<p>Knowing the risks is half the battle, however. And frankly, nothing that was ever worth doing was easy. Every day we reach out to other industry experts, tech gurus and people with real life experience to educate ourselves and build our team. Throughout this entire endeavor we promise to be transparent and honest about our shortcomings but also to shout from the rooftops and give praise where praise is due when things go right. We are open to suggestions, questions and criticisms. Tell us why our idea won't work and make suggestions to make it better. Together we can build a future that is safer and better for our children and for anyone athletes who love to get outside and play. </p>

Three years ago, sitting in a neurobiology lab in Kansas City, our founder was puzzling over a problem he couldn't solve:  Why, he wondered, were the major sports industries not doing more to prevent and protect their athletes from traumatic brain injuries(TBI)? 
Pick up any standard football helmet today and you’ll find some key similarities: lots of padding, heavy construction, with the goal to keep your brain safe.  The way we see it, the problem is that each player that arrives on the field is different than the one next to them.  They have different histories, experience levels and most importantly, body sizes and age. 
Right now the CDC estimates that 1% of the US population suffers from concussions or some form of traumatic head injury (TBI) every year.  That's almost 4 MILLION people!

 
 
 

We strongly believe that we need to do away with the one-size-fits-all thinking about concussion prevention.
Think about it this way: A child is going to experience impact differently than an NFL linebacker. By learning who is wearing the helmet, the sensor we're developing can predict when an impact force is going to potentially hurt the wearer and send a warning signal via Bluetooth to a smart phone or other enabled device.
This helps you as a parent or coach to make decisions on providing care and prevent further injuries.  
A sensor is only as smart as the data it receives.  In order to build a smart sensor, we need to  get them in the hands and on the heads of as many people as possible to help us collect this valuable data.  Artificial intelligence relies on learning from large amounts of accumulated data from various of sources. And we are asking YOU to be our source​.
Our sensor is currently meant for anyone who considers themselves active to wear it.
 

A few of our features:

Issues a warning signal should you encounter a potentially dangerous head impact (such as a fall or a collision). 
Reminds you to upload the data on a regular basis to our server so that we can analyze the data and let you know (should you opt in) if a particular impact is serious enough or not that you should take it easy or if you can get back in the game.  

And because we take into account who you are as an active person, you can rest assured that the feedback you receive will accurate, tailored and unique to you. This separates us from the other ""single-threshold"" sensors on the market. Where they use a one-size fits all approach, we offer a custom profile of what your body can and cannot handle. 
 
From the business side of things, we're asking for $75,000.00 to disrupt the world of youth sports and concussion prevention.
These funds will not only allow us to make our sensors smaller and more powerful but it will also allow us to begin the crucial Phase II development of our smart helmet.
The sooner we can accomplish these things, the sooner  we can begin our field testing phase and get our integrated, active helmets into the hands of youth football teams for testing.
 
The bottom line is that preventing a concussion is a far better approach than attempting to fix the brain after a concussion. Our goal is to reduce the risk of a concussion with our integrated active helmet system.
We literally can't do this without  you--to be able to reach our full potential we are going to need serious investment dollars. Investors generally like to fund things that have been proven to make a difference in the marketplace.
And so we're asking you to help us. Show the world that you're serious about concussion prevention and make our vision a reality.
 


 
We're pretty excited about our perks and we hope you will be too.  You can add a jersey or a t-shirt to any reward by donating an extra 25.00 or 99.00 dollars. Just specify in the comments what size you need and we'll hook you up!
 

 
Our exclusive SeudoSkull jerseys are made of 3.8 oz. 100% moisture-wicking polyester and feature a tear-away neck label. They also have set-in sleeves. They come in any size you could want and are super comfortable.

 
Our Tee-shirts are of the same great quality and are 100% cotton. They come in a myriad of sizes and are sure to be something you're proud to wear around town.

And of course, our sensor is the cream of the crop. It will arrive at your doorstep ready to wear. Just take it out of the box, put it on your head (under a helmet or beanie) and out the door you go. You'll need to download our app from the Play store (link coming soon!) to upload your data.
 


The Center for Disease Control estimates that 1% of the US population suffers from concussions or some form of traumatic head injury (TBI) every year.  
Out of those, as many as 1.5 million children incur sports or recreation related concussions. (This is based on the June ""Pediatrics"" journal article from 2016). 
Concussions can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has no cure and can accelerate brain aging by ~300%.  Furthermore, concussions in children severely reduce brain metabolism, interfere with overall brain development and are therefore all the more devastating. 
There are countless stories from parents whose children have suffered concussions and who are now closely monitoring their success at college, in the work force and other critical turning points in their lives. 
When it comes to the relationship between concussions and CTE, the scientific community is divided. Some believe that it only takes one concussion to cause serious brain trauma and increase the risk of CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy ). Others believe that it may take repeated head injuries. Either way, the odds are bad.
Our brain is literally our most valuable asset. Step up and take action to protect it and make a safer, healthier future a reality.
 

 
 


 
Changing the world and the industry isn't easy. We recognize that. We also recognize that we have a LOT of work ahead of us if we're going to be successful in our mission to eradicate childhood concussions.
Here's an overview of what we've accomplished so far: 

If you're curious, we currently have this patent  as well as the following in-part patents: 

DEVICE AND METHOD TO REDUCE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
DEVICE AND METHOD TO REDUCE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: SENSOR STAGE.​

Challenges:
Ongoing Software Development: As with any technology product, we will be continuously working on refining our code, working on our data analysis and updating our app to be as user-friendly and useful as possible. We are also continuing to pursue better PCB manufacturing options to streamline the look and feel of the sensor for future iterations.
Helmet Manufacturing: While our vision is to create the first integrated helmet/sensor system, we recognize the level of work yet to be done on this front. We have to find and build a relationship with a physical goods manufacturer and ensure a long-tail supply chain for any future development. We are also still in the early stages of mechanical development. To date, We have fabricated and tested several iterations of prototypes in our own lab and the lab of our independent collaborators at several university laboratories.   While these prototypes can only be worn by our lab dummies, our preliminary results are promising and show that we can reduce a significant amount of impact energy.
Field Testing and Adoption: The first thing most companies learn is that change is hard. And we are pushing for a lot of change. Change in the way we think about concussions and more importantly, change in the way people protect their most valuable asset. We are confident based on our current conversations with local area football teams and high schools that we can proceed with our field testing once we have our initial helmet prototype done, but long-term adoption is going to take a village.
Knowing the risks is half the battle, however. And frankly, nothing that was ever worth doing was easy. Every day we reach out to other industry experts, tech gurus and people with real life experience to educate ourselves and build our team. Throughout this entire endeavor we promise to be transparent and honest about our shortcomings but also to shout from the rooftops and give praise where praise is due when things go right. We are open to suggestions, questions and criticisms. Tell us why our idea won't work and make suggestions to make it better. Together we can build a future that is safer and better for our children and for anyone athletes who love to get outside and play.

<strong>Our goal is to raise <u>$90,000</u></strong>.</h2><h3>So this is how we beat the system together!</h3><p>We need to remove traditional insurance but still have insurance. How does that work you ask? This is what has taken us three years to develop. In simple terms.</p><ol>
<li>We need to first have a community that has the same goal. In our case a healthier and better living without government interference to as much as we can. This is what this Crowdfunding Campaign is for.</li>
<li>We then need to connect our members with Direct Primary Care physicians. So many doctors out there are fed up with government interference as much as you are. So they are joining us. You will create a friendship you never thought you could have with your family doctor.</li>
<li>Members who has a DPC will be able to get access to DHC self-insurance program plans after committing to our pledge. Prices for those plans will come later, however they will be very affordable.</li>
<li>So members has the plan. The way we will make it cheaper is we will make the claims process happen between patient and our self-insurance program. The providers will be paid up front in similar way that CareCredit works. Our members will have access to a Credit so they can pay the providers up front.</li>
<li>Providers will set their prices, be reviewed and rated by the DHC members, and they will be paid upon services. Free Market at it's best.</li>

</ul><h3>Unless we work together lawmakers will continue to mess up your healthcare (there are a few out there fighting for your freedoms)</h3><p>Only together can we beat the system. As healthcare providers, businesses, and families. We are creating a free market approach within our community, with a feeling of taking care of each other, something severely lacking in our society today. We need to work on compassion and love for one another.</p><h3>This will help your local communities...</h3><p>The current healthcare system, promoted by insurance companies, encourage us to be sick. The high deductibles, high premiums, doesn't want us to see the doctors. It also causes stress and depression. However DPC, in conjunction with our model, will cut cost, reduce dependence on deductibles, and decrease illness in community. It will also save school districts, county and city governments money as they adopt our approach.</p><h3>Small &amp; medium sized businesses JOIN US!</h3><p>You need to join us! By joining our Self-Insurance group, you will be able to drop your health benefits from the national average of $1500/mo/family, to about $700/mo/family. Plus you will get access to the awesome benefits from Self-insurance. You will be able to reinvest your hard earned money in your business and community. (we would love to tell you in more detail)</p><h3>TAKE ACTION TODAY!</h3><p>We are tired of government interference in our lives. We are going to #ungovernment healthcare and we want you to join us. You have an opportunity to be a part of a cause that will help you, your family, neighbours, communities, businesses, and healthcare providers. Only together will this change happen.</p><h3>So the Premium will go up if we don't band together...</h3><p>How much are you willing to pay for your healthcare?

</h2><h2><strong>...our members concern if we don’t reach our goal...</strong></h2><p>Don’t be afraid. If we against all odds do not reach our complete goal, whatever we do raise will still go towards the Web portal and the legal but it may take a little longer time to get everything off the ground.</p><p><strong>...if we raise more than the goal...</strong><br/>Extra funds raised over the goal will go towards the creation of our own self funded community insurance program. Why line the pocket of the insurance companies, when we can take care of ourselves together?</p><p><strong>...some statistics on where we are in healthcare…</strong><br/>USA spends roughly $3 trillion a year on healthcare, or 18% of the GDP, and still we only rank 41st for life expectancy, 55th in infant mortality, and 49th in maternal mortality.</p><p><strong>...Direct Primary Care (DPC) is…</strong><br/>...key to our working healthcare system. A DPC doctor provides all primary care to their patients for a monthly fee. This include stitches and other semi urgent care. They are usually on call 24/7 and when getting calls, goes to their office to help out. It is what a doctor patient relationship were meant to be. Different DPC charges differently but a good average is about $10-$25 per child per month when connected to their parents account. And an adult cost is usually between $50-$100 dependent on age. Some DPC also charges a family fee. Our goal is to connect our members with Providers that are already using the DPC model, or we will talk to doctors who are looking to change the way they practice.</p><p>Dr. Josh Umbehr, a pioneer in the DPC field, talking with Sean Hannity.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANSF43Rd7bQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><strong>...DHC is located in…</strong><br/>...the state of Utah.</p><p><strong>...limited to one state…</strong><br/>...DHC is not, as it is a membership organization. We are only limited by where our members live. And the more members in a local area, the better we can promote our healthcare model that will help your local community.</p><p><strong>...we can pay at time of service…</strong><br/>… when DHC members are a part of our self-insurance program. Insurance claims process cost providers an estimated $58 per claim on the low end. Then the provider has to wait between 60-180 days for the insurance company to pay the remainder. No one wants to work under those types of circumstances and yet our Healthcare providers are forced to by the insurance companies. DHC Providers, when joining, sets their prices on the website. Our members will know what they will be paying for services and products and will pay on the portal in advanced or at the time of service. DHC Members who opts to participate in our self-insured program, will gain access to a DHC Credit line, that can be used for healthcare, much like CareCredit. Then the member pays back the credit to the DHC Self-insurance program. The provider will not be a part of the resolving of the claim.</p><p><strong>...Providers who are not DHC…</strong><br/>...will still be able to have DHC members use them as many providers are more than willing to take upfront payments. However deductibles (if a part of our wrap around/emergency insurance program) will be higher. We do want to talk to the provider and discuss the benefits of joining DHC as a Provider. We will however shop around for the providers in this case that provides the better price.</p><p><strong>...anyone can become a provider…</strong><br/>…if they provide services or products that promotes healthcare and healthy living. DHC uses the term Provider for anyone who provides a service and/or product to the members. The service or product needs to promote a healthier living, such as to reduce stress, increase vitamins intake, promote exercise, general healthcare, specialists, massage therapy, etc. We promote free market and healthier living. Also members will have the capability to rate the providers and their products/services.</p><p><strong>...you were talking about insurance…</strong><br/>...but DHC is NOT an insurance company (too many regulations). Instead we will create a captive insurance group, where we will provide other businesses the capability to self-insure. DHC will also self-insure and offer our wrap around/emergency plan to our members who follow the set of rules, purpose, cause, and goal, that we need to have in order to offer this type of benefit to members. This is in accordance to the Affordable Care Act, 1301 (a)(3), which says, when a person uses a Direct Primary Care physician, and combine it with an emergency insurance, that will cover all the 10 essentials, they are compliant to the Affordable Care Act. So when we are at this stage of the plan, there will be criteria that needs to be met. More to come on this subject.</p><p><strong>...businesses should join…</strong><br/>… as there is a big problem with our current system which is that small and medium sized businesses are competing for good workforce with big companies but can’t get the same type of deals. Now in DHC small to medium sized businesses will be able to provide better healthcare benefits for less than half the cost of the national average. And the best part, they will be self insured, but within a group. So they will get the benefits of self-insurance but the protection of a bigger group. And when using DPC, with our wrap around plan, they will be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act.</p><p><strong>...when the Affordable Care Act disappears…</strong><br/>...it will be a glorious day. However we developed the model to work well under the ACA.</p><p><strong>...I can contribute...</strong><br/>...on all precious levels even if you aren't a businesses owner. Anything you contribute will go towards your membership once we are up and running. You can also use your credit to donate to someone else's membership and more.</p><p><strong>...I already have insurance...</strong><br/>...as DHC is not an insurance company, you are still very welcome to help and join DHC. We build an awareness that there are better way to do healthcare out there. We want anyone and everyone who wants to help Make Healthcare Great Again to join DHC.</p><p> </p></div>","It is time to fix a broken healthcare system...We have to do it.

I knew the pains I was feeling as a young family father, and what my family and friends were feeling in response to the “Affordable” Care Act.My solution is simple and genius.For success, we need to cut out traditional insurance but still be compliant. ACA holds a jewel which is Direct Primary Care. It is a new concept that allows better connection between family doctors and their patients. Dr. Josh Umbehr, an inspiration to me, and a strong proponent on how DPC will help the healthcare system. You pay a small monthly fee (usually less than an office visit cost) to your primary care physician and he/she will give you all the care you want.Some example of DPC practices:

Bluegrass Family Wellness - Crestwood, KY - Donated to our cause. :)

Gold Direct Care PC - Marblehead, MA

Ashwell Medical Group - Asheville, NC

Direct Access MD - Anderson, SC

Skyline Direct Care - Tucson, AZ

Cottontree Family Clinic - Orem, UT
Our Purpose...Our mission is to Make Healthcare Great Again (#MHGA) by so that people will be able to get access to affordable healthcare again.A diverse team...Hans-Erik Stegeby - CEO and Founder - After frustration with the healthcare system in his own life, Hans-Erik started to talk to others.

The high deductibles, high premiums, doesn't want us to see the doctors. It also causes stress and depression.

...our members concern if we don’t reach our goal...Don’t be afraid. If we against all odds do not reach our complete goal, whatever we do raise will still go towards the Web portal and the legal but it may take a little longer time to get everything off the ground....if we raise more than the goal...Extra funds raised over the goal will go towards the creation of our own self funded community insurance program. Why line the pocket of the insurance companies, when we can take care of ourselves together?...some statistics on where we are in healthcare…USA spends roughly $3 trillion a year on healthcare, or 18% of the GDP, and still we only rank 41st for life expectancy, 55th in infant mortality, and 49th in maternal mortality....Direct Primary Care (DPC) is…...key to our working healthcare system. A DPC doctor provides all primary care to their patients for a monthly fee. This include stitches and other semi urgent care. They are usually on call 24/7 and when getting calls, goes to their office to help out. It is what a doctor patient relationship were meant to be. Different DPC charges differently but a good average is about $10-$25 per child per month when connected to their parents account. And an adult cost is usually between $50-$100 dependent on age. Some DPC also charges a family fee. Our goal is to connect our members with Providers that are already using the DPC model, or we will talk to doctors who are looking to change the way they practice.Dr. Josh Umbehr, a pioneer in the DPC field, talking with Sean Hannity....DHC is located in…...the state of Utah....limited to one state…...DHC is not, as it is a membership organization. We are only limited by where our members live. And the more members in a local area, the better we can promote our healthcare model that will help your local community....we can pay at time of service…… when DHC members are a part of our self-insurance program. Insurance claims process cost providers an estimated $58 per claim on the low end. Then the provider has to wait between 60-180 days for the insurance company to pay the remainder. No one wants to work under those types of circumstances and yet our Healthcare providers are forced to by the insurance companies. DHC Providers, when joining, sets their prices on the website. Our members will know what they will be paying for services and products and will pay on the portal in advanced or at the time of service. DHC Members who opts to participate in our self-insured program, will gain access to a DHC Credit line, that can be used for healthcare, much like CareCredit. Then the member pays back the credit to the DHC Self-insurance program. The provider will not be a part of the resolving of the claim....Providers who are not DHC…...will still be able to have DHC members use them as many providers are more than willing to take upfront payments. However deductibles (if a part of our wrap around/emergency insurance program) will be higher. We do want to talk to the provider and discuss the benefits of joining DHC as a Provider. We will however shop around for the providers in this case that provides the better price....anyone can become a provider……if they provide services or products that promotes healthcare and healthy living. DHC uses the term Provider for anyone who provides a service and/or product to the members. The service or product needs to promote a healthier living, such as to reduce stress, increase vitamins intake, promote exercise, general healthcare, specialists, massage therapy, etc. We promote free market and healthier living. Also members will have the capability to rate the providers and their products/services....you were talking about insurance…...but DHC is NOT an insurance company (too many regulations). Instead we will create a captive insurance group, where we will provide other businesses the capability to self-insure. DHC will also self-insure and offer our wrap around/emergency plan to our members who follow the set of rules, purpose, cause, and goal, that we need to have in order to offer this type of benefit to members. This is in accordance to the Affordable Care Act, 1301 (a)(3), which says, when a person uses a Direct Primary Care physician, and combine it with an emergency insurance, that will cover all the 10 essentials, they are compliant to the Affordable Care Act. So when we are at this stage of the plan, there will be criteria that needs to be met. More to come on this subject....businesses should join…… as there is a big problem with our current system which is that small and medium sized businesses are competing for good workforce with big companies but can’t get the same type of deals. Now in DHC small to medium sized businesses will be able to provide better healthcare benefits for less than half the cost of the national average. And the best part, they will be self insured, but within a group. So they will get the benefits of self-insurance but the protection of a bigger group. And when using DPC, with our wrap around plan, they will be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act....when the Affordable Care Act disappears…...it will be a glorious day. However we developed the model to work well under the ACA....I can contribute......on all precious levels even if you aren't a businesses owner. Anything you contribute will go towards your membership once we are up and running. You can also use your credit to donate to someone else's membership and more....I already have insurance......as DHC is not an insurance company, you are still very welcome to help and join DHC. We build an awareness that there are better way to do healthcare out there. We want anyone and everyone who wants to help Make Healthcare Great Again to join DHC.",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>Introducing TUKI</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477323416/xbqmue0z2v1au1ohp59q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hi, we are Angela and Harald-Sven, a French-Colombian couple living in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg - a small country located in Europe between Belgium, France and Germany. After a career in banking and finance, we wanted to do something useful with our lives. Because we were tired to hear bad things about Colombia, we were looking for an original business idea to change the bad image of Colombia, support the economy of our country and take social action for children. Finally, we decided to promote Colombia through its tasteful juices so appreciated by the Colombians themselves and the tourists which visit our country. We created TUKI, the toucan, with the traditional Colombian<i> sombrero volteado</i>, whose mission is to represent Colombia with his range of juice flavors.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________</p>
<h2>5 unique and unknown flavors</h2>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474475640/bka1qirdoaxq4acy4vdv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>The concept of the TUKI fruit juices is to offer the original quality of a fresh homemade juice, such as in Colombia, but in a bottle and with a longer life cycle. We can achieve this thanks to the quality of the the fruits directly imported from small Colombian producers, our tasty recipes and the cold pasteurisation technique or High Pressure Processing (HPP).  In contrast to traditional fruit juices, even premium juices, TUKI juices are not subject to a heat treatment and keep the vitamins, the taste and the flavor of freshly squeezed juices for more than 60 days!   </p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>​we are the first and only ones who propose an exclusive and healthy range of these 5 unknown flavors in the Western countries</strong>. Each bottle contains the juice of only one fruit : the Lulo, the Mango, the Maracuya, the Mora or the Guanabana. </p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>The Lulo</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474476020/cmzseu0odrwmeuwjhgng.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474476068/za4vrzimjvaydyxb1uln.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>Characterized by its bittersweet and vivid flavor similar to a citrus fruit, <strong>the Lulo </strong>is rich in vitamins A, B, C, iron and phosphorus. Drinking Lulo is excellent to remove toxins from the body, lower high cholesterol , protect arteries,  stimulate immune defenses,  keep skin healthy and combat diseases such as influenza. The Lulo helps to purify the blood and improve sleep. </p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>The Mango</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474477071/y1fg1lq6bfekzpianrsg.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474477121/tjqzns7nwkvwqnjnvdfn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With a taste exceptionally mild, very aromatic and reminiscent of the tropics, <strong>the Mango </strong>is a super fruit, rich in vitamins A and C. It helps to strengthen the heart and human tissues, remove toxins,  prevent premature aging and avoid constipation. Thanks to its high potassium content, the Mango can aid in muscle recovery after physical activity by replacing liquids and minerals lost during exercises. </p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>The Maracuya</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474477735/twtj209pjstkityfgmxe.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474477775/wewdir7zlvlhj07hxjkd.png"" src="""" style=""""/>   </p>
<p><strong>The Maracuya </strong>contains a lot a fibre the body needs to clean the colon, improve digestion and to prevent heart and brain attacks. The Maracuya helps to decrease allergy and asthma triggers. The antioxydants present in the fruit protect healthy cells from aging and from transforming into cancer cells by eliminating free radicals. The Maracuya has a bittersweet flavor, very crisp and refreshing. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<h3>The Mora </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474477850/hgls9fcnynjkx2f6g0bd.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474477945/r8kmwzxhjlvwhywnseci.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Lively and refreshing, <strong>the Mora</strong> (or the Andean blackberry) helps to combat fatigue, constipation, bleeding, diarrhea, stomach and intestinal inflammation. The person with diabetes will appreciate the Mora because its diuretic action can bring down the sugar level in the blood. Malic and citric acids give to the fruit a disinfecting and antimicrobial power. </p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>The Guanabana</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474480188/zejaxyxjqtmw82qcsnkc.png"" src="""" style=""""/>                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474480226/g1gwvcq1r61wiznv2cd0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Tasting both sweet and tart, <strong>the Guanabana </strong>(soursop) is recommended for insomnia, breakdown and nervous disorders. The cancer-fighting properties of the Guanabana are scientifically proven, without any side effect. Rich in fibre and minerals (calcium, potassium and calcium), the Guanabana  protects the immune system and prevent serious infections. </p>

<h2>What we need</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476273197/wmdivxeqnrzzjtb9daht.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>From now on, after a very enthusiastic response from the final consumers and professionals, we want to go a step further. Our goal is to <strong>raise minimum of  USD 55.000  </strong>to continue marketing our juice fruits, become THE premium exotic juice brand, give more support to small Colombian producers and offer a more positive image of Colombia, where most part of our family comes from.</p>
<p><strong>With 55,000 USD</strong>, we can reduce costs by shortening the circuit distribution and buying directly big quantities of raw materials in Colombia (USD 35,200), develop new flavors and bottle sizes (USD 5,500) , obtain the organic certification and strengthen our credibility (USD 14,300). Being organic certified is very expensive, especially for a small company like ours. We have the products and the process to be organic certified, but not the money. </p>
<p><strong>With USD 82,500</strong>, we can also produce marketing and communication material to promote our social and healthy products and their benefits  (USD 5,500), participate in international fairs (USD 11,000 ) and create pop-up stores (USD 11,000).</p>
<p><strong>With USD 110,000</strong>, we can grow our presence on the web and in the social media (USD 11,000) and develop an international digital communication strategy (USD 16,500).</p>
<p><strong>With USD 165,000</strong>, we can  hire employees and trainees (USD 49,500), find new distributors (USD 5,500) and start a success story.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>a part of the funds raised during the campaign (10%) will go to the  Pies </strong><b><strong>Descalzos Foundation</strong><i>.  </i></b>This non-profit organization, <strong>founded by the Colombian artist Shakira</strong>, aims to aid low-income children from Colombia through education and give them a future.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long are the juices good for?</strong></p>
<p>60 days from production date, thanks to HPP process which permits to obtain the quality of a fresh homemade squeezed juice in a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do I have to keep the juices cold?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the juices need to stay refrigerated. You can keep them outside the fridge only for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>​Q : How are the TUKI fruit juices different from others?</strong></p>
<p><strong>​</strong>1. The juices are completely natural.<br/>2. The TUKI fruit juices are free of preservatives, additives and dyes.<br/>3. The vitamins are preserved. <br/>4. TUKI is the only brand to OFFER bottled juices from these Colombian fruits as homemade. THIS PROPOSAL is UNIQUE !<br/>5. Other juices with other Colombian fruits will follow soon !<br/>6. ONLY 1 FRUIT per bottle to enjoy the natural taste of each fruit</p>
<p><strong>​Q : Is there some sugar added?</strong></p>
<p>Only natural sugar from plants in some juices in order to reduce the acidity and to respect juice recipes as they are homemade prepared in Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>Q : Is the taste of the TUKI fruit juices really different?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely yes!  The taste of our fruit juices is strong. You'll never forget our fruit juices after having tried them. </p>
<p><strong>​Q : What is High Pressure Processing (HPP)?</strong></p>
<p>High Pressure Processing is a processing method wherein the bottles are subjected to very high pressures (up to 120,000 pounds per square inch - 5.000-6000 bars) to kill the bacteria without heating the juices. This cold pasteurization technique respects to a maximum the organoleptic characteristics of the fruits such as the vitamins, the nutrients, the authentic taste and the freshness.  </p>

</div></div>","Introducing TUKI

Hi, we are Angela and Harald-Sven, a French-Colombian couple living in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg - a small country located in Europe between Belgium, France and Germany. After a career in banking and finance, we wanted to do something useful with our lives. Because we were tired to hear bad things about Colombia, we were looking for an original business idea to change the bad image of Colombia, support the economy of our country and take social action for children. Finally, we decided to promote Colombia through its tasteful juices so appreciated by the Colombians themselves and the tourists which visit our country. We created TUKI, the toucan, with the traditional Colombian sombrero volteado, whose mission is to represent Colombia with his range of juice flavors.
___________________________________________________________
5 unique and unknown flavors

The concept of the TUKI fruit juices is to offer the original quality of a fresh homemade juice, such as in Colombia, but in a bottle and with a longer life cycle. We can achieve this thanks to the quality of the the fruits directly imported from small Colombian producers, our tasty recipes and the cold pasteurisation technique or High Pressure Processing (HPP).  In contrast to traditional fruit juices, even premium juices, TUKI juices are not subject to a heat treatment and keep the vitamins, the taste and the flavor of freshly squeezed juices for more than 60 days!   
Moreover, ​we are the first and only ones who propose an exclusive and healthy range of these 5 unknown flavors in the Western countries. Each bottle contains the juice of only one fruit : the Lulo, the Mango, the Maracuya, the Mora or the Guanabana. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Lulo
                      
Characterized by its bittersweet and vivid flavor similar to a citrus fruit, the Lulo is rich in vitamins A, B, C, iron and phosphorus. Drinking Lulo is excellent to remove toxins from the body, lower high cholesterol , protect arteries,  stimulate immune defenses,  keep skin healthy and combat diseases such as influenza. The Lulo helps to purify the blood and improve sleep. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mango
                      
With a taste exceptionally mild, very aromatic and reminiscent of the tropics, the Mango is a super fruit, rich in vitamins A and C. It helps to strengthen the heart and human tissues, remove toxins,  prevent premature aging and avoid constipation. Thanks to its high potassium content, the Mango can aid in muscle recovery after physical activity by replacing liquids and minerals lost during exercises. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Maracuya
                       
The Maracuya contains a lot a fibre the body needs to clean the colon, improve digestion and to prevent heart and brain attacks. The Maracuya helps to decrease allergy and asthma triggers. The antioxydants present in the fruit protect healthy cells from aging and from transforming into cancer cells by eliminating free radicals. The Maracuya has a bittersweet flavor, very crisp and refreshing. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mora 
                     
Lively and refreshing, the Mora (or the Andean blackberry) helps to combat fatigue, constipation, bleeding, diarrhea, stomach and intestinal inflammation. The person with diabetes will appreciate the Mora because its diuretic action can bring down the sugar level in the blood. Malic and citric acids give to the fruit a disinfecting and antimicrobial power. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Guanabana
                         
Tasting both sweet and tart, the Guanabana (soursop) is recommended for insomnia, breakdown and nervous disorders. The cancer-fighting properties of the Guanabana are scientifically proven, without any side effect. Rich in fibre and minerals (calcium, potassium and calcium), the Guanabana  protects the immune system and prevent serious infections.

What we need

From now on, after a very enthusiastic response from the final consumers and professionals, we want to go a step further. Our goal is to raise minimum of  USD 55.000  to continue marketing our juice fruits, become THE premium exotic juice brand, give more support to small Colombian producers and offer a more positive image of Colombia, where most part of our family comes from.
With 55,000 USD, we can reduce costs by shortening the circuit distribution and buying directly big quantities of raw materials in Colombia (USD 35,200), develop new flavors and bottle sizes (USD 5,500) , obtain the organic certification and strengthen our credibility (USD 14,300). Being organic certified is very expensive, especially for a small company like ours. We have the products and the process to be organic certified, but not the money. 
With USD 82,500, we can also produce marketing and communication material to promote our social and healthy products and their benefits  (USD 5,500), participate in international fairs (USD 11,000 ) and create pop-up stores (USD 11,000).
With USD 110,000, we can grow our presence on the web and in the social media (USD 11,000) and develop an international digital communication strategy (USD 16,500).
With USD 165,000, we can  hire employees and trainees (USD 49,500), find new distributors (USD 5,500) and start a success story.
Moreover, a part of the funds raised during the campaign (10%) will go to the  Pies Descalzos Foundation.  This non-profit organization, founded by the Colombian artist Shakira, aims to aid low-income children from Colombia through education and give them a future.

</h3><h3><strong>A PERSONAL STORY</strong></h3><p>My Grandma suffers from Alzheimer’s Disease. The illness has caused her to forget things that were very important to her. We stay connected by sending her photos through her iPad, in hopes that she would remember us for as long as possible. Her caregiver would give her the iPad and my Grandma would look at the photos. Sometimes she remembers the people in the photos, sometimes she doesn’t, because recognizing people is becoming increasingly difficult. She also needs her caregiver to help her remember to do everyday tasks such as taking medication or making phone calls. Her illness is making difficult for to stay connected with each other.</p><p>As the disease progressed, my grandma started to lose track of time and have difficulty managing her daily activities. We set up visual aids around the house to help her remember events, and continued to send her photos, in hope that she would remember us, for as long as possible.</p><p>The picture below is the whiteboard we put up for my grandma in her living room. It has my Dad’s phone number on top. In the middle is the phone number of the person she needs to visit and the respective address.

The illness has caused her to forget things that were very important to her. We stay connected by sending her photos through her iPad, in hopes that she would remember us for as long as possible. Her caregiver would give her the iPad and my Grandma would look at the photos. Sometimes she remembers the people in the photos, sometimes she doesn’t, because recognizing people is becoming increasingly difficult. She also needs her caregiver to help her remember to do everyday tasks such as taking medication or making phone calls. Her illness is making difficult for to stay connected with each other.As the disease progressed, my grandma started to lose track of time and have difficulty managing her daily activities. We set up visual aids around the house to help her remember events, and continued to send her photos, in hope that she would remember us, for as long as possible.The picture below is the whiteboard we put up for my grandma in her living room. It has my Dad’s phone number on top. In the middle is the phone number of the person she needs to visit and the respective address. ""Sunday"", the day of the week of this particular day, is written at the bottom in Chinese.On the left is the iPad that my grandmother uses to look at pictures we sent her.As time went by, I started to wonder, is there a simple mobile app that could help my grandmother and other Alzheimer’s or dementia patients remember events, stay engaged with friends and family, and recognize people around them? An app that could help my grandmother in the same way that all the things we set up for her helps her remember?My family hunted extensively for such an app we were sure must exist. But we came away disappointed because in fact, it didn’t.There are many tools in the market but none of them help patients improve their daily lives. We also found that there were very few apps developed for elderly, due to the stereotype that old people cannot use technology. They are the underserved demographic.Right at around that time, I started learning how to code in Swift, an iOS Programming Language. So I took the matter into my own hands and developed Timeless.WHAT IS TIMELESS?Timeless is a first of its kind, simple, caregiver assisted, easy-to-use mobile app for Alzheimer’s and dementia that helps them remember events, stay connected and engaged with friends and family, and recognize loved ones using artificial intelligence-based facial recognition technology. PHASE I of Timeless has four key functions:The patient signs into Timeless with Touch-ID or Face-ID. Passwords are not needed. Timeless is managed by a caregiver. The role of the caregiver is to help set up events, activities, appointments and manage the patients' Timeless circle of friends.Timeless’ comprehensive feature set addresses the daily challenges faced by Alzheimer’s patients in a unique and simple way.Timeless works on all Apple devices including all iPhones 6 or above with  iOS 11 or up, and iPads.Phase I is a foundational phase and once it is built, additional functionalities will be added in Phase II and III.FUTURE PLANSPHASE IIPHASE IIIDEVELOPMENT PROGRESS TO-DATETimeless' concept was incubated in March 2016, and a prototype was built in April 2016. The concept was very well received and garnered many awards and recognitions. I have since worked with Ms. Liliia Mandrino - a Human Experience Designer based in Dallas, Texas, who has provided in-kind support to revamp the app's UX/UI design. Liliia and I then subsequently worked with Dr. Melissa Kramps, an Alzheimer's Disease Specialist, to ensure that the app is designed with the needs of an Alzheimer's patients in mind. The app is now completely redesigned. The next step is to complete the development of the app so that it can be piloted with patients and their families.CHALLENGES AND RISKSThe prototype was developed entirely by myself. Since I am a full-time student, my time is limited and therefore the development progress has been slow.  I can continue to develop the app myself but the risk of not completing the app is high. I realized that in order to scale the development, I need to expand the development resources beyond myself so that I can get the development off the ground quickly.RESOURCES NETWORKAfter many rounds of recruitment research, I connected with a software developer in Cologne, Germany who will join me in the development of Timeless.With a design expert and a software developer, I believe I have a resources network in place to take Timeless' development to the next level.What we need now is funding for the development & marketing efforts for Phase I & II. FUNDING NEEDSWe are seeking to raise $50,000 to support the development and marketing of Timeless. The breakdown of the required funding is as follows:1. $10,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase I 2. $20,000 - Design and development of Phase II 3. $20,000 - First Year Maintenance & Support + Marketing and Promotion costDevelopment Timeline:THE TEAM ADVISORS TECHNOLOGY SPONSORThe AI-based facial recognition technology behind Timeless is provided by Kairos, a human analytics start-up based in Miami. THE IMPACTPREVALENCE OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASEToday, Alzheimer’s disease is a serious problem around the world. Alzheimer’s is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that affects 50 million people worldwide. In the US, one in three seniors dies with Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia. The disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the US, affecting more than 5 million Americans. Not only does the disease affect the patient, but also caregivers, including family, friends and care professionals. 60% of Alzheimer's and dementia caregivers rate the emotional stress of caregiving as high or very high; about 40% suffer from depression.

Unlike other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer’s disease prevalence is on the rise with 13 million Americans and 130 million globally projected to suffer from the disease by 2050. Recent estimates suggest that the illness has become the third leading cause of death in the US, behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. In the absence of a cure for the illness, developing solutions to help Alzheimer’s patients to live better daily life  is increasingly pressing.

By showing people that despite living with mental illness, it's still possible to pursue and fulfill big goals and dreams, the hope is that this story will inspire others to do the same.
By sharing their journey through the video series and through speaking, James and Brent will impact thousands of people who have struggled with their mental health and empower them to not only talk openly about mental health, but pursue their dreams and live full lives.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

ENGLISH VERSIONThey support with it a social project because the manufacturing occurs in social workshops.The Problem ..The
fridge is a health hazard and the biggest problem in the household because densely populated with germs1)
2).Spoiled food, mold, bad smell, lack of overview and spoiled in the farthest corner are the daily hassles. Each household is spoiling food at a range of € 350,00 per year and household3).A necessary cleaning every 4 weeks is done rarely or not at all, because that's far too much trouble.Facts ..
1) Federal Office for Classificaton of Risks www.bfr.bund.de   TÜV Süd AG, food quality2) Yearly over 100.000 illnesses caused by spoiled food are reported to the     Robert Koch Institute. The estimated number of unknown cases ranges at mostly 1 million of toxicopathies, diarrhoeas, vomiting, fever.
3)University of Stuttgart. Findings of food, spoiled per household and year. Februar 2012, ordered by the Federal Republik of Germany, Ministry of Food.

The most common pathogens:

Listeria
Salmonellae
Campylobacter (notifiable)
Escherichia Coli
Staphylococcus
Mold spores (mycotoxins)




The problem solution ..The
TAEBLETT© with multi function fits in 98% of all refrigerators.
An integrated Clean System© (cartridge patented) prevents germs inside the fridge
and on food at a range of up to 99,9% (scientifically proven), leaving food
freshly for a longer time.
Annoying mold and nasty smell are prevented, too. The
Clean cartridge has to be changed monthly, whereby you save more than it costs.
Its use is absolutely safe.

On the rotary plate everything is visible at a glance, at
the same time you can carry it to the table and back again.
The TAEBLETT© a truly revolutionary advance for hygiene, order,
freshness and cost savings in the refrigerator. Daily useful and helpful.


4) According to
expert opinion of the University of Hannover, disinfectant action of 90 to
99,9%. 

So clean through the TAEBLETT©
with Clean System©

 ..



Function

Storage surface- For everything what drips and to thaw.- Easy to clean.- A real problem solving.

Millions consumers wait for it. 


Suggested retail price including VAT €/Consumer:


State of things: 


Prototypes are ready. All developing costs are already financed of one’s
own.
For series production large-scale tolls have to be produced, then commerce
can be supplied as i.g.:


common trade (non-food)
producer of fridges

teleshopping
direct sale

online commerce 

Stock of fridges in the EU, USA, Canada, Russia, Turkey, 280 millions, all
have the same problem! Planned TAEBLETT©  sales at least 0,4% of total fridge stock,
starting from the 4th business year – 1,12 million pieces of TAEBLETT©. 


This project fills a real gap in the market with sole position
characteristic.

The aim of the campaign 


The campaign serves to support the expensive tolls costs,
costs for first production and insertion running up to € 40.000,00.

What you get ..Delivery probably in December 2016.

<p>The approach I'm taking all boils down to spreading  awareness of evolutionarily-minded functional health practices  to empower individuals  with  the means to make effective decisions and utilize the body's natural design. Better health makes everything in life better. When our body systems function how they're meant to, we're able to perform better and make better choices. I believe that cultivating this foundation of health is a prominent catalyst to generate  positive advances for the greater good.</p>
<p>In order to make the biggest impact, I want #NETT90 to be as accessible as possible to anyone and everyone, so my intention is to make the cost of the program $0.00. Yes, that's right... <strong>FREE!</strong></p>

<p>While there are many others who are much more knowledgeable and experienced than I am, I believe I possess a history of diverse experiences that allow me to relate with a wide range of personalities, which gives me the ability to disseminate information effectively.

I wish to utilize this degree of understanding to synthesize valuable concepts about well-being and connect people with more accurate and useful information.</p>
<p>I've always been pretty keen on health, but I really began diving deep into research, studies, and self-experimentation when I turned the ripe old age of 30. Over the past 6+ years, I have been clocking an average of around 15 hours per week learning about various health topics on my own, totaling thousands of hours grasping fundamentals of the health sciences while uncovering cutting-edge research and the latest discoveries - a lot of which flies against the annals of conventional wisdom many of us have grown up buying into.</p>
<p style=""color: #999999;""><strong>(If you'd like an idea of my health influences, I've listed them at the end of this page.)</strong></p>
<h2>What is #NETT90?</h2>
<p>#NETT90 is a 90-day program I developed with the objective to enable anyone to easily benefit from it. It basically consists of daily installments containing information and simple recommendations to implement into your lifestyle. The program encompasses most everything around the mental, physical, and social aspects of health, including guidance around fitness and nutrition.</p>
<p>You may find conventional medical professionals, trainers, health programs, and the like focusing on just one or two aspects of health and doing so in a generalized manner. What they tend to neglect is how everybody is different and the body works as a system comprised of many intricate parts that only function optimally when they are all healthy and in sync with each other.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why certain diets or workouts that work miracles for your friends seem to do nothing for you other than make you miserable and result in disaster no matter how much effort you put in to adhering to the plan? It's because your body is not the same as your friends' or anyone else's for that matter.</p>
<p>Without maintaining a proper balance all throughout, you may be spinning your wheels or even doing yourself more harm than good. #NETT90 encompasses all  aspects of health and provides you with the foundation to gain awareness of functional health to empower you to determine what is best specifically for your own body.</p>
<h3>Who is this for?</h3>
<p>#NETT90 is for <strong>everybody</strong>! While it may be most effective for beginners who are unsure of where to start their journey, even if you are well into another program or already have your regimens dialed in, this program is so different from anything else that's out there (and it's so easy) that you should be able to stack it on top of what you are already doing, and it will exponentially improve what you're already doing. Many of the practices take just seconds to complete and others take just minutes. The hardest part may be to remember implementing the practices, but the program aids with that too!</p>
<p>#NETT90 isn't an extreme diet or workout program that will take up a lot of time and effort. It's a program that helps you incorporate simple techniques to build habits that utilize the human body's inherent design to your benefit. These techniques bring awareness back to processes that have been overlooked due to the patterns we have developed in the comforts of the modern lifestyle. The basic practices in #NETT90 will benefit anybody, and are foundational to health. Implementing them into your lifestyle and developing them into habits will add a positive synergistic effect to everything else you do. </p>
<p style=""color: #00b6ff;""><strong>All you need is a few minutes every day to read the installments, and then what you do with the material is completely up to you. Implementation of the bare minimum practices  takes up just a minute or two out of your day. If you were to implement everything recommended in #NETT90, you could  spend as little as 15-20 minutes of total time to complete your practices over a few minutes here and there throughout your entire day. The goal is to build the practices into habits so they eventually become a natural part of your lifestyle.</strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I spent the past few months taking a few of my friends through an alpha testing run of #NETT90. While I certainly appreciate their trust and participation, it was also a selfish move on my part to get my ass in gear and put my thoughts into action as well as to keep myself accountable and write out the program in a timely manner. I encountered a few bumps throughout the process, as expected, but the first draft of the program has far exceeded my expectations.</p>
<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BFNN0V4pH-h/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464305296/nett90-calendar-indiegogo_fbzbjj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>So, I already have a draft of the entire #NETT90 program completed. While the alpha run was quite raw in that it was simply a daily text email and I didn't prepare other elements I would like to incorporate in order to keep participants motivated and engaged, some of my friends took off with it anyway, and their results have been utterly astounding.</p>
<p>For example, my friend Audrey had been suffering from <a href=""http://www.ccfa.org/what-are-crohns-and-colitis/what-is-crohns-disease/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crohn's disease</a> over the past few years and maintains a highly stressful management position at a Fortune 50 company. Not only did she reverse practically all of her symptoms of Crohn's, she now wakes up happier and starts her days off in a much better mood, she is able to sustain this happiness as well as her energy levels throughout her day, and she is enjoying a more fulfilling life overall! Not to mention, while I want to emphasize that this is not an extreme weight loss program, Audrey's tremendous improvement in health manifested in an amazing body transformation!</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://optimusthrive.com/wp-content/uploads/audrey-nett90-indiegogo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Audrey had experienced mixed results with advice from others and many different programs over the years. She describes #NETT90 as:</p>
<blockquote>""The best non-diet available today for those who want to FEEL healthy. A total brain-to-body health program which aligns your mental state with your physical being to become aligned into a happier and more fulfilled you.""</blockquote>
<h2>The Challenges</h2>
<p>I have been developing #NETT90 on my own time. For my job, I run my own business as a digital marketing consultant in which I wear many hats. Not to mention, my newfound health over the past few years has led me to dabble in the semi-pro ranks of soccer where I try to keep up with much younger players who are trying to break into the professional ranks, some of whom are literally half my age. I also spend time donating my marketing skills to various non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Since I've been getting more and more into the intricacies of upgrading health and performance, I have become less and less active in selling my business services. While I never really found it necessary to market myself since I had been able to get more than enough business through word of mouth and referrals from colleagues, I haven't been networking very much in that sphere over the past few years. Therefore, I've been finding myself having to put more time into the process of obtaining clients lately. Rather than being left to do what I do best, this has led me to spend more time being a terrible salesperson and chasing leads, which leaves me quite taxed and frustrated.</p>
<p>Ironically, as I finish up the initial testing round of #NETT90, I also find myself at the worst health I've been at for quite awhile. The extra work I've been having to do plus the time I've been putting into this program everyday has led me to sleep terribly, and I have also lost six pounds of muscle mass over the past two months.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464482752/fitbit-sleep-indiegogo_zitahd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464482762/withings-weight-indiegogo_fyjnsw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have also been dealing with a torn muscle in my rotator cuff and a severely bruised hip, and to top it all off, I  broke my middle toe completely through, and now it requires surgery!</p>
<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BEeLiz5JHzQ/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464482830/bruised-hip-indiegogo_ygzb03.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BFUbTC5JHwC/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464482840/broken-toe-indiegogo_soznbv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>While you might interpret this as a ruse to gain  your sympathy, it's actually an attempt to show my empathy toward those of you who go about every day in a sub-optimal state of health. I want you to know that I can relate to how you feel! <span style=""color:#FF0000;""><em><strong>It sucks!!</strong></em></span></p>
<p>Not to undermine your own struggles if you have them, but my quick downturn in health could be considered to be even more devastating since I know what it feels like to be on top of my game and perform at a high level on a daily basis. Fortunately for me, I knowingly put myself at risk of my current sufferings and I know how to mitigate the harmful effects. Being able to relate to poor health just motivates me even more and I want to pass on the foundations of what I have learned on to you.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I really want to get this out to the masses as soon as possible, so you can help me devote more time toward developing #NETT90 by contributing just <strong>$5</strong> (or more if you want!) to get in on the beta testing round. I know I said I want to make this program free for everyone, but hopefully $5 isn't too much to ask in exchange for behind-the-scenes access and being one of the first participants to go through this life-changing program.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, you will be given access to a private Facebook group where you may ask questions and share your own thoughts and experiences with other beta testers as well as myself and a few of my friends who completed the alpha testing round.</strong></p>
<p>I don't think I've ever seen a comprehensive program like this being offered for the price of a cup of coffee, or for free, no less. Many of them go for at least $100!</p>
<p style=""color: #00b6ff;""><strong>The program will commence with an introductory email on Sunday, June 5, 2016 to get you ready for Day 1 on Monday, June 6, 2016. Since #NETT90 is so simple, especially over the first few weeks, this campaign is set to run through Wednesday, June 8, 2016, because it will be easy for you to catch up.</strong></p>
<p>Since I want to make #NETT90 free, there is not much else I could offer, though I suppose you could also consider helping me bypass the dreaded part of my actual job where I have to put on my salesperson hat. I happen to be a 12+ year veteran in the digital marketing space who specializes in organic search. I'm well-respected among my peers for my SEO (Search Engine Optimization) abilities, and over the years I have also immersed myself in related channels like social media, paid search, and conversion optimization.</p>
<p align=""center""><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/ckchung"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img align=""middle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464483131/linkedin_jrbx1b.png"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""""/></a><a href=""https://moz.com/rand/recommended-list-seo-consultants/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img align=""middle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464483138/moz-recommended_udojbj.jpg"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Please don't use this campaign or <a href=""http://webosis.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my website</a> as an example of my marketing proficiency. I haven't had the need to put much of any work into my website until recently. As for this Indiegogo campaign, it was a last minute idea, and I have less than two weeks before the beta run begins. I'm pretty much doing everything wrong when it comes to conventional marketing and ""experts"" would probably shake their heads at the way I'm going about here. With that said, while I've always been one to think outside the box, I also want to take the marketing aspect out of your health. That is the main reason why I want to launch this program for <strong>FREE</strong>.</p>
<p>I would love to make a career out of this, so I do want to make money from it, but not directly from  people who want to improve their health. While there's high value in the exchange of knowledge, a lot of what I have learned over the years has been made freely available by the generosity of experts who share the mindset to spread goodwill. Even so, one reason you may not be as aware of functional health practices is because all you need to implement them is yourself, and there's no money in that! Pharmaceutical companies certainly don't want you to know that you inherently possess the abilities to do what their pills do, gyms and trainers don't want you to know that you don't necessarily need them to reach your goals, and other programs and diets don't want you to learn exactly how and why they do or don't work (if they even know). Fortunately, I can perpetuate the generosity and utilize my skills in marketing to spread awareness of functional health for free while implementing other methods to generate income.</p>
<p>I take the same approach with digital marketing as I do with health. There are many practitioners who follow a single-minded approach or chase an irrelevant metric. A business' online presence is comprised of many intricate parts that only function optimally when they are all optimized properly and in sync with each other.</p>
<p>I am known for defining ""<a href=""http://webosis.com/holistic-seo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">holistic SEO</a>"":</p>
<blockquote>A synergistic website marketing strategy that utilizes a variety of online channels and other related elements of marketing and web development in conjunction with search engine optimization (SEO).</blockquote>
<h4>A Great Deal for Businesses - 50% OFF!</h4>
<p>I've been kicking around a new service and I'd like to offer it exclusively via this campaign for <strong>half off</strong> to see if I can get it off the ground. It's what I'm currently referring to as an <em>SEO Brain Dump</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like. <strong>I will spend an hour to analyze your web presence and provide you with any and all of the recommendations I can come up with to improve it.</strong></p>
<p>My colleagues who provide a level of work comparable to mine post  hourly rates of $500 or more. I've been laying low over the past few years, so I have set my hourly rate at $300. Therefore, my offer here for my <em>SEO Brain Dump</em> is <strong>$150</strong>.</p>
<h4 style=""background-color: #36ff00;"">A Greater Deal for Health-Conscious Businesses - 50% OFF!</h4>
<p>Over the past few years, I have also become a lot more conscious about the type of projects I work on and who I'm making money for. As I become more and more mindful of health and making a positive impact on the world, I want to do my best to align that with my business as well. So, for businesses that focus on functional health and/or green, eco-friendly, organic, sustainable offerings, I will discount my <em>SEO Brian Dump</em> service to a mere <span style=""background-color: #36ff00;""><strong>$100</strong></span>.</p>
<h3>Where the Money Will Go</h3>
<p>By selling my services at a deep discount, I will actually lose money with this campaign, unless <strong>a lot</strong> of people sign up for the beta run. However, since I'm developing #NETT90 on my own time, knowing I won't have to worry about putting on my sales hat to secure $2500 worth of work will basically allow me to spend more time on #NETT90 over the first month of the beta testing round. Whatever you can contribute will help!</p>
<h4>Flex Goals</h4>
<p>If this happens to catch on, <strong>$5000</strong> will carry me through two months of being able to spend more time on #NETT90, and <strong>$7500</strong> will carry me through to the end of the beta testing round!</p>
<p style=""color: #00b6ff;""><em><strong>My ultimate vision is to have #NETT90 bundled up into a full-featured app, so anything extra will go toward fulfilling that vision.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the means to contribute, but are desperate to get your health in gear, please feel free to contact me and I will grant you free access to the #NETT90 beta.</p>
<p>You can also help by making some noise about #NETT90 and sharing my vision with the world! Please share this page through your social media accounts and tell all of your friends and family about it (there are share buttons toward the top of this page that you may use). Everybody can benefit from better health!</p>

</table></div>","The deterioration of  health is sending a wave of destruction throughout humanity. You cannot go a day without being bombarded with news and articles surrounding health issues like heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, or depression. While those issues cause serious harm to the individuals who suffer from them, our society has also become rampant with atrocious events causing harm to masses of people that are provoked by individuals suffering from mental illnesses. In order to turn the tide, we must empower individuals with an understanding of why this epidemic is occurring and the tools to improve overall health.
The Gist
My name is CK, and my core mission is to make the world a better place. In essence, everything in my life thus far has led me to pursue this endeavor now in an attempt to make the biggest impact I possibly can on humanity.
Quite a statement, huh?
Advances in technology have made it easy for us to fall into a comfort zone that essentially hijacks our biology and turns off many of the processes our body systems are meant carry out. #NETT90 is designed to bring awareness back to those processes and show you how to implement simple practices into your daily life in order to reclaim your body's naturally healthy capacity.
The approach I'm taking all boils down to spreading  awareness of evolutionarily-minded functional health practices  to empower individuals  with  the means to make effective decisions and utilize the body's natural design. Better health makes everything in life better. When our body systems function how they're meant to, we're able to perform better and make better choices. I believe that cultivating this foundation of health is a prominent catalyst to generate  positive advances for the greater good.
In order to make the biggest impact, I want #NETT90 to be as accessible as possible to anyone and everyone, so my intention is to make the cost of the program $0.00. Yes, that's right... FREE!
Who is CK?
I’m not a medical professional, I don’t have any health or fitness certifications, I’m not a professional athlete. In many respects, I’m just a pretty average 30-something guy. I have a (standing dancing) desk job, I pay a mortgage, I’m in a long-term relationship…
While there are many others who are much more knowledgeable and experienced than I am, I believe I possess a history of diverse experiences that allow me to relate with a wide range of personalities, which gives me the ability to disseminate information effectively. Furthermore, if high IQ is a sign of competence, I am a Mensan - I reveal this not to brag, but as a hasty indicator to let you know I'm not a (completely) delusional idiot. I wish to utilize this degree of understanding to synthesize valuable concepts about well-being and connect people with more accurate and useful information.
I've always been pretty keen on health, but I really began diving deep into research, studies, and self-experimentation when I turned the ripe old age of 30. Over the past 6+ years, I have been clocking an average of around 15 hours per week learning about various health topics on my own, totaling thousands of hours grasping fundamentals of the health sciences while uncovering cutting-edge research and the latest discoveries - a lot of which flies against the annals of conventional wisdom many of us have grown up buying into.
(If you'd like an idea of my health influences, I've listed them at the end of this page.)
What is #NETT90?
#NETT90 is a 90-day program I developed with the objective to enable anyone to easily benefit from it. It basically consists of daily installments containing information and simple recommendations to implement into your lifestyle. The program encompasses most everything around the mental, physical, and social aspects of health, including guidance around fitness and nutrition.
You may find conventional medical professionals, trainers, health programs, and the like focusing on just one or two aspects of health and doing so in a generalized manner. What they tend to neglect is how everybody is different and the body works as a system comprised of many intricate parts that only function optimally when they are all healthy and in sync with each other.
Have you ever wondered why certain diets or workouts that work miracles for your friends seem to do nothing for you other than make you miserable and result in disaster no matter how much effort you put in to adhering to the plan? It's because your body is not the same as your friends' or anyone else's for that matter.
Without maintaining a proper balance all throughout, you may be spinning your wheels or even doing yourself more harm than good. #NETT90 encompasses all  aspects of health and provides you with the foundation to gain awareness of functional health to empower you to determine what is best specifically for your own body.
Who is this for?
#NETT90 is for everybody! While it may be most effective for beginners who are unsure of where to start their journey, even if you are well into another program or already have your regimens dialed in, this program is so different from anything else that's out there (and it's so easy) that you should be able to stack it on top of what you are already doing, and it will exponentially improve what you're already doing. Many of the practices take just seconds to complete and others take just minutes. The hardest part may be to remember implementing the practices, but the program aids with that too!
#NETT90 isn't an extreme diet or workout program that will take up a lot of time and effort. It's a program that helps you incorporate simple techniques to build habits that utilize the human body's inherent design to your benefit. These techniques bring awareness back to processes that have been overlooked due to the patterns we have developed in the comforts of the modern lifestyle. The basic practices in #NETT90 will benefit anybody, and are foundational to health. Implementing them into your lifestyle and developing them into habits will add a positive synergistic effect to everything else you do. 
All you need is a few minutes every day to read the installments, and then what you do with the material is completely up to you. Implementation of the bare minimum practices  takes up just a minute or two out of your day. If you were to implement everything recommended in #NETT90, you could  spend as little as 15-20 minutes of total time to complete your practices over a few minutes here and there throughout your entire day. The goal is to build the practices into habits so they eventually become a natural part of your lifestyle.
The Impact
I spent the past few months taking a few of my friends through an alpha testing run of #NETT90. While I certainly appreciate their trust and participation, it was also a selfish move on my part to get my ass in gear and put my thoughts into action as well as to keep myself accountable and write out the program in a timely manner. I encountered a few bumps throughout the process, as expected, but the first draft of the program has far exceeded my expectations.

So, I already have a draft of the entire #NETT90 program completed. While the alpha run was quite raw in that it was simply a daily text email and I didn't prepare other elements I would like to incorporate in order to keep participants motivated and engaged, some of my friends took off with it anyway, and their results have been utterly astounding.
For example, my friend Audrey had been suffering from Crohn's disease over the past few years and maintains a highly stressful management position at a Fortune 50 company. Not only did she reverse practically all of her symptoms of Crohn's, she now wakes up happier and starts her days off in a much better mood, she is able to sustain this happiness as well as her energy levels throughout her day, and she is enjoying a more fulfilling life overall! Not to mention, while I want to emphasize that this is not an extreme weight loss program, Audrey's tremendous improvement in health manifested in an amazing body transformation!

Audrey had experienced mixed results with advice from others and many different programs over the years. She describes #NETT90 as:
""The best non-diet available today for those who want to FEEL healthy. A total brain-to-body health program which aligns your mental state with your physical being to become aligned into a happier and more fulfilled you.""
The Challenges
I have been developing #NETT90 on my own time. For my job, I run my own business as a digital marketing consultant in which I wear many hats. Not to mention, my newfound health over the past few years has led me to dabble in the semi-pro ranks of soccer where I try to keep up with much younger players who are trying to break into the professional ranks, some of whom are literally half my age. I also spend time donating my marketing skills to various non-profit organizations.
Since I've been getting more and more into the intricacies of upgrading health and performance, I have become less and less active in selling my business services. While I never really found it necessary to market myself since I had been able to get more than enough business through word of mouth and referrals from colleagues, I haven't been networking very much in that sphere over the past few years. Therefore, I've been finding myself having to put more time into the process of obtaining clients lately. Rather than being left to do what I do best, this has led me to spend more time being a terrible salesperson and chasing leads, which leaves me quite taxed and frustrated.
Ironically, as I finish up the initial testing round of #NETT90, I also find myself at the worst health I've been at for quite awhile. The extra work I've been having to do plus the time I've been putting into this program everyday has led me to sleep terribly, and I have also lost six pounds of muscle mass over the past two months.

I have also been dealing with a torn muscle in my rotator cuff and a severely bruised hip, and to top it all off, I  broke my middle toe completely through, and now it requires surgery!

While you might interpret this as a ruse to gain  your sympathy, it's actually an attempt to show my empathy toward those of you who go about every day in a sub-optimal state of health. I want you to know that I can relate to how you feel! It sucks!!
Not to undermine your own struggles if you have them, but my quick downturn in health could be considered to be even more devastating since I know what it feels like to be on top of my game and perform at a high level on a daily basis. Fortunately for me, I knowingly put myself at risk of my current sufferings and I know how to mitigate the harmful effects. Being able to relate to poor health just motivates me even more and I want to pass on the foundations of what I have learned on to you.

What I Need & What You Get
I really want to get this out to the masses as soon as possible, so you can help me devote more time toward developing #NETT90 by contributing just $5 (or more if you want!) to get in on the beta testing round. I know I said I want to make this program free for everyone, but hopefully $5 isn't too much to ask in exchange for behind-the-scenes access and being one of the first participants to go through this life-changing program.
In addition, you will be given access to a private Facebook group where you may ask questions and share your own thoughts and experiences with other beta testers as well as myself and a few of my friends who completed the alpha testing round.
I don't think I've ever seen a comprehensive program like this being offered for the price of a cup of coffee, or for free, no less. Many of them go for at least $100!
The program will commence with an introductory email on Sunday, June 5, 2016 to get you ready for Day 1 on Monday, June 6, 2016. Since #NETT90 is so simple, especially over the first few weeks, this campaign is set to run through Wednesday, June 8, 2016, because it will be easy for you to catch up.
Since I want to make #NETT90 free, there is not much else I could offer, though I suppose you could also consider helping me bypass the dreaded part of my actual job where I have to put on my salesperson hat. I happen to be a 12+ year veteran in the digital marketing space who specializes in organic search. I'm well-respected among my peers for my SEO (Search Engine Optimization) abilities, and over the years I have also immersed myself in related channels like social media, paid search, and conversion optimization.

Please don't use this campaign or my website as an example of my marketing proficiency. I haven't had the need to put much of any work into my website until recently. As for this Indiegogo campaign, it was a last minute idea, and I have less than two weeks before the beta run begins. I'm pretty much doing everything wrong when it comes to conventional marketing and ""experts"" would probably shake their heads at the way I'm going about here. With that said, while I've always been one to think outside the box, I also want to take the marketing aspect out of your health. That is the main reason why I want to launch this program for FREE.
I would love to make a career out of this, so I do want to make money from it, but not directly from  people who want to improve their health. While there's high value in the exchange of knowledge, a lot of what I have learned over the years has been made freely available by the generosity of experts who share the mindset to spread goodwill. Even so, one reason you may not be as aware of functional health practices is because all you need to implement them is yourself, and there's no money in that! Pharmaceutical companies certainly don't want you to know that you inherently possess the abilities to do what their pills do, gyms and trainers don't want you to know that you don't necessarily need them to reach your goals, and other programs and diets don't want you to learn exactly how and why they do or don't work (if they even know). Fortunately, I can perpetuate the generosity and utilize my skills in marketing to spread awareness of functional health for free while implementing other methods to generate income.
I take the same approach with digital marketing as I do with health. There are many practitioners who follow a single-minded approach or chase an irrelevant metric. A business' online presence is comprised of many intricate parts that only function optimally when they are all optimized properly and in sync with each other.
I am known for defining ""holistic SEO"":
A synergistic website marketing strategy that utilizes a variety of online channels and other related elements of marketing and web development in conjunction with search engine optimization (SEO).
A Great Deal for Businesses - 50% OFF!
I've been kicking around a new service and I'd like to offer it exclusively via this campaign for half off to see if I can get it off the ground. It's what I'm currently referring to as an SEO Brain Dump, which is exactly what it sounds like. I will spend an hour to analyze your web presence and provide you with any and all of the recommendations I can come up with to improve it.
My colleagues who provide a level of work comparable to mine post  hourly rates of $500 or more. I've been laying low over the past few years, so I have set my hourly rate at $300. Therefore, my offer here for my SEO Brain Dump is $150.
A Greater Deal for Health-Conscious Businesses - 50% OFF!
Over the past few years, I have also become a lot more conscious about the type of projects I work on and who I'm making money for. As I become more and more mindful of health and making a positive impact on the world, I want to do my best to align that with my business as well. So, for businesses that focus on functional health and/or green, eco-friendly, organic, sustainable offerings, I will discount my SEO Brian Dump service to a mere $100.
Where the Money Will Go
By selling my services at a deep discount, I will actually lose money with this campaign, unless a lot of people sign up for the beta run. However, since I'm developing #NETT90 on my own time, knowing I won't have to worry about putting on my sales hat to secure $2500 worth of work will basically allow me to spend more time on #NETT90 over the first month of the beta testing round. Whatever you can contribute will help!
Flex Goals
If this happens to catch on, $5000 will carry me through two months of being able to spend more time on #NETT90, and $7500 will carry me through to the end of the beta testing round!
My ultimate vision is to have #NETT90 bundled up into a full-featured app, so anything extra will go toward fulfilling that vision.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have the means to contribute, but are desperate to get your health in gear, please feel free to contact me and I will grant you free access to the #NETT90 beta.
You can also help by making some noise about #NETT90 and sharing my vision with the world! Please share this page through your social media accounts and tell all of your friends and family about it (there are share buttons toward the top of this page that you may use). Everybody can benefit from better health!

$250 Limited to 50 Devices!GreenVaro (Patent Pending. Application No. 15/088,658) is a
comprehensive hardware and software system designed for complex environmental
monitoring applications that alerts you when your environment is not safe.14
dedicated sensors provide capabilities for collection and analysis of various
environmental parameters, allowing for the results to be displayed on your
smartphone and for the data to be transmitted to a server for further processing
and monitoring.GreenVaro differs from all known
environmental monitoring solutions as it allows extensible integrated
environmental monitoring of up to 14 parameters simultaneously. Moreover, the
number of these parameters can be increased with additional sensors.GreenVaro can be provided as a
single block including some basic sensors or as a modular system with multiple
sensors for collection and analysis of a wide range of different environmental
factors.Due to the system’s
modular structure, the user can easily set the required sensor configuration,
as well as upgrade or replace the actual sensor modules.The software part
of the system consists of a cloud solution and a mobile application that allows
flexible access to information and provides opportunities for further
server-side data analysis with results being displayed on the mobile application.
Since the system is
an end-to-end hardware and software solution allowing data transmission via 3G,
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, it opens a variety of possible usage opportunities,
including outdoor and indoor installations (e.g. in homes, restaurants,
manufacturing facilities, etc.). Full access to the information can be provided
through a mobile phone application or the system’s website.













                 GreenVaro mobile application allows you to connect to the server via 3G
Internet or Wi-Fi in order to provide full access to the expert data analysis
system and tips and recommendations for improving environmental conditions in
specific situations or according to the concentration of certain substances in
the air.


Available
for iOS and Android

Regular
updates of environmental measurements

Measurements
History Management via data transmission with the server



User alert
feature when one of the parameters goes above or below the accepted range



Display of
the analytical information from the expert system and recommendations for
environmental conditions improvements



Management
and configuration of the system and sensors



Interaction
with smart watches based on iOS and Android (to be implemented)


Initialization
of communication with the device with a special QR code (found on the actual
device). The QR code contains a unique number of the device’s Bluetooth adapter
(or other unique number). This number is used to ensure that the software only
works with this specific device. Also at this stage, the user profile can be
created on the system’s website.

<br/>As a <strong>US Army Veteran</strong>, <strong>software architect</strong> and ISSA certified <strong>fitness trainer</strong> with over 30 years of first-hand software development, personal training, and competition fitness experience, I originally came up with the ALLN-1: Functional Fitness Bench idea when I operated my own fitness studio in San Diego.  And as an ex-competitive bodybuilder and personal trainer, I understand that to buy enough good equipment to thoroughly stock a fitness studio, can easily cost upwards of $30k.  So I spent the past 18 years with a goal to develop a single piece of fitness equipment that would 1) allow users to get an <strong>EFFECTIVE</strong> total body workout, 2) required minimal <strong>SPACE</strong>, 3) easy to continually <strong>UPGRADE</strong> and most importantly, 4) simple enough so that it’s <strong>EASY</strong> to teach others how to use it...while still being <strong>commercially durable</strong>.</div>

In closing, as a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, I will still run a Lean operation, however, I will optimize purchasing, packaging, and shipping operations so that products will be shipped within 24 hours of being ordered.  Additionally, funds will be used to bring on additional part-time resources so that I can complete several other innovative ALLN-1 Exercise Bench Options that I haven’t been able to complete because I’ve been wearing all of the other hats in the business—and innovating, is really what I want to continue focusing on.    So, let’s change the fitness industry together!

</p><p>I am a Registered Nurse, Certified Case Manager, and
Geriatric Care Specialist in Jacksonville, FL. In my professional role as an
elder care manager I see the need for our senior citizens to stay as strong and
mobile as possible. When discussing issues such as falls, mental decline, and
social isolation with other healthcare professionals and family members of
seniors, I have decided to establish a fitness/wellness center (<u>Active
Living Fitness Center</u>) that will concurrently address the fitness and
social needs of our seniors.</p>
<p>  In the current
reimbursement climate many seniors are prematurely discharged from formal
rehabilitation programs (i.e. in-patient rehabilitation facilities, out-patient
rehabilitation clinics, home health services, etc.) before fully recovering and
returning to a safe functional status.</p>
<p>  The proposed
fitness/wellness center will provide our senior citizens with a safe,
non-intimidating environment for participation in fitness programs that are
supervised by licensed health care professionals who are on-site at all times.</p>
<p>  In this
venture I am partnering with my son, a Doctor of Physical Therapy, and other
physical/occupational therapists. In addition, <u>Active Living Fitness Center</u>
will also offer ongoing health/wellness educational programs, and will provide
opportunities for social interaction between members. Education will also be
integral to the overall success of promoting a more active lifestyle, with
classes offered frequently by experts in different fields. Fitness classes,
yoga, private personal training sessions and massage will also be available. A
“Cool-Down Corner” with healthy refreshments and comfortable seating will
provide the opportunity to relax, talk, watch TV and socialize with others
during their time at the Studio. Drivers, care-givers, spouses, friends, etc.
will also be able to utilize this area while our well trained staff helps the
client complete their exercise regimen.</p>
<p>  The key to
successfully exercising when challenged with health issues and advancing age is
SAFETY. At <u>Active Living Fitness Center</u>, licensed healthcare
professionals (RN’s, CNA’s, Physical Therapists, Licensed Physical Therapist
Assistants, and Certified Personal Trainers trained in geriatric exercise) will assist with developing a
customized exercise program for each client.</p>
<p>We are seeking to raise $15,000 to
help fund <u>Active Living Fitness Center</u>. The studio will be open to those
55 yrs. and older, any adults with chronic medical issues, and also those with
impairments that may limit their ability to join other fitness/wellness
facilities such as:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Dementia (must be able to follow instructions

<p>The most prevalent prosthetic hand in the world is a hook, technology that hasn’t changed since the 1800s and is unintuitive to control. State-of-the-art hands can be controlled through residual muscles, but cost up to $30000. They also break all the time, are still clumsy to control, and do not give the user any sensory feedback. PSYONIC’s hand solves all these problems while <i><strong>costing less than a tenth in raw materials</strong></i> compared to state-of-the-art commercially available hands.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498903701/tttefygboq8dqvc3ilvb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is our latest prototype. All 5 fingers can individually flex and extend and the thumb also rotates. Most commercially available hands are large and sized only for males. Ours is<i><strong> 50th percentile female-sized</strong></i> and <i><strong>weighs 20% less</strong></i> than an average human hand. It’s also<i><strong> USB-rechargeable</strong></i>.</p>

<p>The hand is controlled through muscle signals from the forearm that are processed by our muscle processing unit. We use a <i><strong>machine learning algorithm</strong></i> that can detect when the user is making different hand movements including hand close, hand open, a fine pinch, a three-finger grasp, and rest. After a quick <i><strong>2-minute training session</strong></i>, the hand recognizes the different hand movements and responds accordingly.</p>

<p><i><strong><u>NO</u> commercially available bionic hand gives users useful sensory feedback</strong></i>. We give that ability back to users by using low-cost pressure sensors embedded in the fingertips.

<p></p><p>
</p><p>FPCs can have a vibration
problem.<span>  Because of the compression and
explosive forces induced into a FPC, the rod journals bend slightly in the
direction of rotation. For that short time period, the crankshaft is out of balance.  At a point in the
rotation, the rod journal springs back into position producing a ring or
harmonic just like a musical note.  All
crankshafts have this tendency.  But they
are more relevant in an FPC because the bending is being concentrated along a
single plane.  SCG will engineer out these vibrations using a propriety guide specification. The goal for this campaign
is to design and deliver a tuned rotational kit to maximize horsepower while
reducing harmonic rotational vibration. 
All the components will be produced here in America by the top rated
racing component manufactures. SCG feels that failures at high speed due to
inferior quality parts are not acceptable.  The following graphics explains the need for a kit and what comes in a kit.</span>

participate in the Texas Mile and other noteworthy races.  The goal is
market the product as actionable, survivable, and available.  The track car will provide this.<br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p>The FlatFast product development line can be seen here.</p>

<p>The FPC is not a new idea.<span>  These crankshafts for decades have been the
purview of Ferrari, Porsche, and McLaren. 
In America, the cross plane crankshaft has been the standard---heavy,
lower RPM, mass produced, odd exhaust node. 
As a result, American street and racing fanatics have been left out in
the cold.  SCG’s goal is to change this
decades old paradigm with a choice for street and racing fanatics.  Your contributions will push a new American
based initiative on to the street and racing scene for the world.  As a backer to this game changer, you
are a team member at Stevie’s Crazy Garage.  But first let’s talk about the contribution
target.  The target
goal for this crowdfunding paradigm shift is $460,000.  This will cover the development of the
components, building of the test mule engines, the test car, awards, fees, and

fanatical about providing high performance parts and quality knowledge transfer
videos. With the development of the FlatFast Crankshaft™ kit, SCG will move the
automotive street and racing communities into the realm of obtainable European
sport car performance and sound zone. Imagine making shifts in your super light
V-8 road racer at 9,000 revolutions per minute, or lighting off one of these
engines at the local drive-in and cruising Grand Ave.  The new FlatFast Crankshaft™ Kit is a flat plane
crankshaft. 
What is a Flat Plane Crankshaft
(FPC)?

 
All rod journals embedded in the crankshaft
lay in the same  geometrical plane
Examine this illustration below for
a better interpretation of a FPC:

Although there are 2 types FPC
designs, SCG will use what is commonly called an ""Up Down Down Up"" design.  Examine the illustration below for more
detail.

Why a Flat Plane Crankshaft?


 Extremely high RPM – lightweight
crankshaft

 Even firing order – engine fires
evenly from bank to bank

 Less shifting at the track – power
band is higher and broader 

 Radical exhaust note – this is
directly due to the effectiveness of the even firing order

In addition, FPC engines are extremely
rare in the American racing market today. 
With this campaign and your help, SCG is going change the options
available on the American race track.


FPCs can have a vibration
problem.  Because of the compression and
explosive forces induced into a FPC, the rod journals bend slightly in the
direction of rotation. For that short time period, the crankshaft is out of balance.  At a point in the
rotation, the rod journal springs back into position producing a ring or
harmonic just like a musical note.  All
crankshafts have this tendency.  But they
are more relevant in an FPC because the bending is being concentrated along a
single plane.  SCG will engineer out these vibrations using a propriety guide specification. The goal for this campaign
is to design and deliver a tuned rotational kit to maximize horsepower while
reducing harmonic rotational vibration. 
All the components will be produced here in America by the top rated
racing component manufactures. SCG feels that failures at high speed due to
inferior quality parts are not acceptable.  The following graphics explains the need for a kit and what comes in a kit.



On the above table is an example of
a FlatFast Crankshaft kit.  For the more experienced engine builder,  SCG is examining the possibility of a Crankshaft and Camshaft kit.  It would be up to the engine builder to supply the Pistons, Rods, and Dampener.   For either kit type,  SCG will take customer orders for the crankshafts and camshafts to fit racing rules or power requirements.   But plan well because of the 16 week lead time.

The video link about will provide more info on the workings of a FPC.


SCG has already designed the
specifications for the FPC components for several style engine blocks---Ford
Coyote, Ford Modular, Ford Windsor---8.2” and 9.5”, Chevrolet LS, Chevrolet
Small Block, Toyota 5.7L, Chrysler LA, and Chrysler Gen III Hemi.  The garage needs funding to at least build a prototype.  The prototypes will range from $35,000 to $45,000.  The graphic below is for a Ford Coyote based test engine.  So for the plan of record on development the garage needs $35,000 from backers plus fees to build a FlastFast prototype. If the garage can reach $170,000 from backers,  a stamp can be built which will reduce the machining cost of the crankshafts by almost half.  This would also include the prototype build for 1 engine.  These are the minimum and best production cost case that the garage needs to move forward.  Each additional $35,000 - $45,000 backer contributions will go to a new prototype.  Four  prototypes are scheduled for now---9.2"" Ford Windsor, Coyote, LSx, and Small Block Chevy.  If enough backer contributions are obtained during the campaign---$112,000, a track test car will be built for a prototype engine.  Why is this so expensive?  Well SCG priced several options including buying a low cost and older Camaro or Mustang.  The car would need to be completely rebuilt with expensive new everything.  It does sound fun, but the least expensive option that the garage found was a super car meant for the track.  Yes it's true.  SCG would build an RCR Superlite race car to
participate in the Texas Mile and other noteworthy races.  The goal is
market the product as actionable, survivable, and available.  The track car will provide this.The FlatFast product development line can be seen here.




The FPC is not a new idea.  These crankshafts for decades have been the
purview of Ferrari, Porsche, and McLaren. 
In America, the cross plane crankshaft has been the standard---heavy,
lower RPM, mass produced, odd exhaust node. 
As a result, American street and racing fanatics have been left out in
the cold.  SCG’s goal is to change this
decades old paradigm with a choice for street and racing fanatics.  Your contributions will push a new American
based initiative on to the street and racing scene for the world.  As a backer to this game changer, you
are a team member at Stevie’s Crazy Garage.  But first let’s talk about the contribution
target.  The target
goal for this crowdfunding paradigm shift is $460,000.  This will cover the development of the
components, building of the test mule engines, the test car, awards, fees, and
taxes for the campaign.  This
contribution level will also place FlatFast Crankshaft Kits into the SCG
inventory for 16 weeks which is the time it takes to cut a high quality racing crankshaft.  This target goal is a substantial amount,  and the garage can build prototypes for much less.  But to be clear this contribution goal is the fastest way to the race track.


You can see from the above graph
that a full 30% of the contributions go to overhead.  Given the cost of any business endeavor this
amount is very fair and SCG is covered for taxes for the 2016 year due to the
late time of year for ordering and processing components that do not yet exist.

SCG considers contributors to this
campaign to be part of the race team. 
Therefore, it only makes sense to setup the award levels in terms of the
jobs required by a successful automotive racing team.  SCG created 11 awards unique to the racing industry and 20 levels based losely on race team jobs.  Stevie did not want the awards

<p>Beyond the supportive structures which exist in my life, I posses other qualifications. I am a 200 hour RYT who is pursuing her 500 hour designation. I have a degree in Spanish, making me capable of one day taking this offering to diverse communities. I also have one year of AmeriCorps experience, during which I faced and grew comfortable navigating the challenging social issues of our time.

I will have to remember the metaphorical lotus flower, which only blooms in the murkiest and muddiest of waters. My obvious challenges include generating a sustainable income stream and creating partnerships within the community that support this vision. While I have already aligned myself with the organization and teachers listed above, I will have to work at making this project one which sustains itself. I am researching grants and other creative partnerships for this purpose.  I am prepared with patience and also plan on using the Indiegogo campaign funds to hire a low-cost business coach to help me create a solid business plan. I intend to see this project grow into a strong, capable and living entity. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>

I completed my 200 hour RYT at The Glowing Body, and the people who run the space are very special indeed. 
Additionally, I will use the funds to cover my costs for lodging during my continued yoga studies. I complete my 300 hour yoga training in August of 2015, at which time I will be a 500 hour RYT and nearly half way through my Masters degree.The remaining funds will be applied to those everyday costs of starting up your own lil' business. Funds will be broken down in the following ways:- 10 sets of yoga mats, blankets, and bolsters (10 x $120 per set) = $1200
- Lodging for 3 remaining weekends of 300 hour training (3 x $165 per weekend) = $495
- Reduced-cost business coach from local non-profit entrepreneur education center ($40 per session x 6 sessions) = $240- New business cards with Narrative Yoga brand = $50 (approx.)- Indiegogo fees = $300 (approx.)
Any additional funds raised will be applied towards business licensing fees, website development, marketing materials, and home-office organization (e.g. purchasing Quickbooks, invoicing software, office supplies, etc.)
FORWARD MOMENTUM:This project is answering a very strong call to bring narrative to our fractured modern world. In a culture where there exists police brutality, fear, and misunderstanding, we need story sharing and yoga (or union) more than ever. In a world where people are made to feel small, we need our breath and our bodies to remind us that we are big. I am fortunate to live in a community which fosters this kind of forward momentum and that I possess the gift of being able to birth this project into a supportive environment in which it will thrive. 
In Asheville, the soul-awakening work of Laura Hope-Gill, director of Lenoir-Rhyne University's Narrative Medicine Program, has started the conversation.  It's academic study began formally at Columbia University Medical Center in 2009, and the Center for Narrative Practice will expand on this work thanks to its successful Indiegogo campaign.
My study of yoga continues to be supported, guided, and inspired by the foundational bricks of Kelly Golden's Vira Bhava Yoga training, which dares to explore deeply the subtleties of the practice like no other.
Beyond the supportive structures which exist in my life, I posses other qualifications. I am a 200 hour RYT who is pursuing her 500 hour designation. I have a degree in Spanish, making me capable of one day taking this offering to diverse communities. I also have one year of AmeriCorps experience, during which I faced and grew comfortable navigating the challenging social issues of our time. I used yoga to empower myself during my volunteer experience, and I continue to do so now.

CHALLENGES:Those who work in the shadow areas where healing and transformation take place are well aware of the challenges one faces on this path. I will have to remember the metaphorical lotus flower, which only blooms in the murkiest and muddiest of waters. My obvious challenges include generating a sustainable income stream and creating partnerships within the community that support this vision. While I have already aligned myself with the organization and teachers listed above, I will have to work at making this project one which sustains itself. I am researching grants and other creative partnerships for this purpose.  I am prepared with patience and also plan on using the Indiegogo campaign funds to hire a low-cost business coach to help me create a solid business plan. I intend to see this project grow into a strong, capable and living entity. 
AS A THANK YOU:
I will remember your donations and offer those who spend $100 or more a space in any workshops and special events that happen within the next year (stay tuned!).

<u>OUR
APPROACH TO FIGHTING NEURODEGENERATION IS GUIDED BY 3 BASIC PRINCIPLES:</u>
<br/>1. Big Pharma's search for ""novel"" compounds to fight neurodegenerative
diseases are wasteful and are a reflection of their greed, not a result of
there being a lack of known compounds that has shown neuroprotective qualities.
<br/>2. All neurodegenerative diseases are metabolic diseases with multiple causative pathological pathways, which are in the end irrelevant in the search for a cure. What is important is not what causes neurodegeneration, but what sustains it. We need to address the 'sustaining' pathological pathways such as oxidative  stress, protein &amp; DNA mutation, aberrant inflammation, demyelation, impaired autophagy, insulin resistance, transition metal ions build-up, cholesterol build-up, liver ceramides build-up and more.
<br/>3. All neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. ALS,Alzheimer's, Huntington, Parkinson's MS, MSA, etc.,) are all the same disease, just presenting in different sections of the CNS with different contributing weights/impacts from the causative pathological pathways.

 preclinical research (using cell lines and animal models), researchers
have tested many organic compounds (e.g.Trehalose, Curcumin and others)

This should not be surprising since the increase in neurodegenerative diseases followed revolutionary changes in Western diets that resulted in an exponential rise in the consumption of highly processed foods, which either lack the appropriate nutrients for long-term support of the central nervous system (CNS) and systemic metabolic functions, or contain added ingredients that impair protective actions of natural food substances. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19703216"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moving forward with nutrition in Alzheimer's disease</a>. Scheltens, 2009)<br/><br/>Current research in academia are leading to a greater understanding of the underlying pathologies causing many
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease. <br/><br/>Implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, is the compromise of the Mitochondria via an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative damage. ROS (e.g. superoxides and hydrogen peroxide) are created during respiration - the process by which cells convert the nutrients we consume into energy, specifically Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Respiration itself takes place in the Mitochondria.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Impairment of the Mitochondria leads to reduce ATP production and increased ROS production. This in turn leads to cellular inflammation, protein aggregation,  mutant DNA formation, as well as other neurodegenerations. As a result of these neurodegenerative processes, the body's own immune system get turned against the impaired neuronal cells, causing further damages that can lead to neuronial demyelination and eventually cell death.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another fascinating finding from preclinical research is that excessive cholestrol build-up in brain tissue resembles early stage Alzheimer's disease (<a href=""http://www.molecularneurodegeneration.com/content/9/1/60"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Increasing membrane cholesterol of neurons in culture recapitulates Alzheimer’s disease early phenotypes</a>. Marquer et al. 2014)<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Interestingly, if neurogenerative diseases are actual metabolic diseases, it's possible that they have their origins not in the brain, but rather in a distant organ, namely the liver. Ceramides build-up in the liver can migrate to the brain where it causes insulin insensitivity. Insulin is an extremely important hormone that's produced in the pancreas and which is involved in numerous metabolic processes, including ATP production in the Mitochondria  (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528849/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sphingolipids, insulin resistance, and metabolic disease: new insights from in vivo manipulation of sphingolipid metabolism</a>.  Holland et al. 
2008).<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ceramides are are a family of waxy lipid molecules containing, sphingolipids, which are toxic to neuronal cells. They are lipid signaling molecules that cause<br/>insulin resistance by activating pro-inflammatory cytokines. (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17561816"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Insulin-like growth factor-1-dependent maintenance of neuronal metabolism through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway is inhibited by C2-ceramide in CAD cells</a>. Gibson 2007) <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A final note on ceramides, if you have neurodegeneration and don't think ceramides are implicated, you may want to answer this question. Do you have Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NFLD); this is where you have an apparent beer belly without being a major beer drinker? NFLD is a dysfunction of the liver, and long before your gut started protruding, your liver was pumping out ceramides into your brain, (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408814/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Role of Ceramides in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</a> Pagadala et al. 2012)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">That initial insulin insensitivity brought on by the invading ceramides from the liver could be what starts the entire neurodegeneration cascade. That nudge causes the Mitochondria to misfire like a sputtering engine producing too much smoke (ROS) for the antioxidants in the cells to extinguish and not enough power (ATP) to give each cellular component enough energy to execute their respective tasks (the brain only makes up 2% of our body mass, but consumes 20% of the energy our body produces). Once the process builds up steam, it becomes like a runaway train or an avalanche.</p>

<br/><br/>Well, in one word... EXPERIENCED! <br/><br/>Put simply, we have traveled this developmental pathway before, successfully. <br/><br/>COORGA Nutraceuticals is one of the relative few US registered dietary supplements developers with products sold in stores in Canada. This is because all natural health products (NHP) legally sold in Canada must first receive a license from Health Canada. Before such license are granted, the NHP undergoes an extensive review to assess both its efficacy and safety. 
Health Canada is widely regarded as one of the toughest regulators of NHP with an approval rate of 40% as of 2010, the last time figures were available.<br/><br/>COORGA Nutraceuticals has developed some innovative treatments in the past despite an environment replete with naysayers.

<a href=""http://www.tumordefence.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TumorDefence™</a>, is a NHP we developed as an adjuvant treatment for chemo and radiation therapy, with an indication for fighting cancer metastasis.

 shown to reverse greying, for which we have a <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US20130017260"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">US patent</a>. This product 
was also approved by Health Canada to re-mediate cellular oxidative 
stress and lipid peroxidation caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This product works best for people who started greying within 7 years of when they started using it. Essentially, normal greying is due to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation caused by ROS (specifically, hydrogen peroxide) build-up at the base of the hair follicle. The hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) bleaches the follicle as it grows while preventing the hair from being able to repair itself. Removing the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> stops these processes and since the hair follicle is still producing melanin, hair color returns overtime. For those following closely, you will note the similarity in terms of ROS dysfunction remediation approved for Grey Defence® as those proposed herein. The main difference being that Grey Defence® targets oxidative stress in hair follicle cells, while the multi-functional therapeutic agent will target oxidative stress in neuronal cells.</li>

Retweet if you agree, be sure to include the link to this project in the tweet... let's get the word out.

OUR
APPROACH TO FIGHTING NEURODEGENERATION IS GUIDED BY 3 BASIC PRINCIPLES:
1. Big Pharma's search for ""novel"" compounds to fight neurodegenerative
diseases are wasteful and are a reflection of their greed, not a result of
there being a lack of known compounds that has shown neuroprotective qualities.
2. All neurodegenerative diseases are metabolic diseases with multiple causative pathological pathways, which are in the end irrelevant in the search for a cure. What is important is not what causes neurodegeneration, but what sustains it. We need to address the 'sustaining' pathological pathways such as oxidative  stress, protein & DNA mutation, aberrant inflammation, demyelation, impaired autophagy, insulin resistance, transition metal ions build-up, cholesterol build-up, liver ceramides build-up and more.
3. All neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. ALS,Alzheimer's, Huntington, Parkinson's MS, MSA, etc.,) are all the same disease, just presenting in different sections of the CNS with different contributing weights/impacts from the causative pathological pathways.


In
 preclinical research (using cell lines and animal models), researchers
have tested many organic compounds (e.g.Trehalose, Curcumin and others) 
and found many that showed promising potential for reducing neurodegeneration by removing β-amyloid, prion build-up and calming down excited microglia cells in the brain (these are the immune cells of the brain that when activated attacks the brain cells that are damaged, continues attacks eventually kill the neurons, even those that were healthy).  Trehalose is the sugar used to sweeten chewing gum.
That's the good news... there are known compounds effective in dealing with neurodegeneration.
*Trehalose alleviates polyglutamine-mediated pathology in a mouse model of Huntington disease Tanaka et al 2004. *Inhibition of Protease-Resistant Prion Protein Accumulation In Vitro by Curcumin Caughey et al., 2003.*Can trehalose prevent neurodegeneration? Insights from experimental studies Emanuele 2014.
The not so good news is that the extremely low oral 
bioavailability (it does not get into your body becuase it's brokendown in your stomach) of these natural compounds prevents them from being used
effectively by everyday citizens to fight neurodegeneration and protect their brain cells from further decay.Currently there are no treatments available (natural or otherwise) to address the underlying issues causing neurodegenerative diseases. A successful project could be a lifeline for millions of people suffering from such debilitating diseases, while giving hope to those worried about eventually developing such diseases themselves.
Despite the not so good news, there is
 reason to be hopeful, because at least, now we know that there are 
viable candidate compounds available to protect brain cells. Compounds that if optimized, may 
be just the ticket toward effective neuronal protection.

Here are some more good news.The
 techniques required to take these natural compounds from potential 
candidates to actual therapies already exists and are in everyday use in
 the pharmaceutical industry - techniques such as  thin film barrier 
coatings, particle size modifications (in the nanoscale size range), surface modification and complexation. 
Big pharma if properly motivated can have therapies that include these compounds on the market in months.
Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical 
industrial complex isn't interest in bringing these natural compounds to
 market. They cannot patent these natural compounds and make 
embarrassingly large monopolistic profits on them by way of a protected 
patent. A chewing gum sweetener (Trehalose) is just not going to generate for them the humongous profits they've grown entitled to. Additionally, these compounds would compete with the expensive 
drugs they currently have on the market (many of which are not very 
effective but still costs a bundle).
Here is the really good news... this
 is the age of the social internet, where sites like Indiegogo allow the
 small guys to pool their resources and do things the big guys can't or won't.
 With this project, you finally have your say on the development of 
these natural compounds into effective neuroprotective agents.  YOU HAVE THE POWER!
Herein, we are proposing a project to take these compounds from ideation
 to finish therapeutic agents and we need your help, both financially 
and in spreading the word. 

The
 essence of the overall project is to take thirty plus compounds that 
showed the highest potentials as neuroprotective agents and complex them
 into a multi-functional therapeutic agent to fight neurodegeneration 
and enhance neuroprotection.

The project will be broken down into 
four phases to maximize the chance of overall success. Summary of each 
phase appears immediately below, while full details appears further down
 in their own sections.



Phase One: Develop proof of concept bioparticles containing the 
least bioavailable compound (Trehalose) to demonstrate an optimized oral
 bioavailability (Budget $20,000). 

Phase Two: Bioparticle Optimization to ensure that the particle 
can transit the blood brain barrier (BBB) and is not cytotoxic (Budget 
$25,000). 

Phase Three: Convert the bioparticle into a multi-functional 
therapeutic agent by adding the other thirty plus compounds to the 
Trehalose already in the bioparticle, while maintaining bioavialability 
and the ability to pass the BBB. (Budget $90,000).

Phase Four: Assess efficacy of the multi-functional therapeutic 
agent against various neurodegenerative disease states (Overall budget 
$225,000).

Remember...
 what we are trying to achieve is not being done by 'big pharma' and we 
need your help, even if you do not have funds to contribute you can 
still help by getting the word out. Let us get these compounds off the 
shelf and into the hands of those who need them fast, because once you 
lose a neuron, it's lost forever!

Email the link to this page or the accompanying video to a friend.
Tweet and ask those who are in your network to re-tweet your tweet about this project. 
You just never know who may benefit, since those suffering from 
neurodegeneration do not go around and advertise that fact, but your 
tweets, emails and link sharing may be able to reach someone who will 
benefit from this project, so please share liberally and often. A
 little note on the provided perks. brainJOLT!™ the NHP being given away in the featured perk, is an NHP developed for a friend who had extreme fatigued, she has since been diagnosed with MS. brainJOLT!™ worked so well that its capabilities were extended and submitted for Health Canada for approval. It is now the only Health Canada approved NHP with a claim to boost working memory, additional approved claims includes reducing fatigue and making the body resistance to stress. Anyone suffering from extreme fatigue needs brainJOLT!™ to get through their day, it is extremely effective and has no side-effects.
TumorDefence™, our newest NHP is currently undergoing Health Canada review for sale in Canadian stores. TumorDefence™ is only available via the ""I Hate Cancer"" perk. It works by modulating the immune system to aggressively go after tumor cells even if they have metastasized, regardless of cancer type. If you know anyone with cancer looking for an additional tool, please point them to the ""I Hate Cancer"" perk, it could save their lives.
Additionally, you may have noticed, we have 
classified the perks into different ""umbrella"" categories such as Well 
Wishers, Advocates & Champions. The classifications broadly speaking
 dictates the discounts projected based on estimated materials cost and 
imputed retail price on the final product.  The Theoretical Effective Dose (TED) is 20 grams and is to be 
taken by dissolution in water or juice. The TED is computed by including
 all ingredients at their individually demonstrated effective dosages as reported in preclinical and epidemiological research. 

It is our belief that the Actual Effective Dose (AED), consisting of over thirty compounds working synergistically together,
 will be significantly lower than the TED. AED will be calculated once 
animal efficacy studies are concluded and we make adjustments for animal
 vs. human metabolic rate. 
The specific projected discounts per perk is as follows:


Well Wishers - Bronze, Silver, Gold: N/A (MfT-A not provided)
Advocates - Bronze: 10% Discount
Advocates - Silver: 15% Discount
Advocates - Gold: 20% Discount
Advocates - Platinum: 25% Discount
Champions - Gold: 30% Discount
Champions - Platinum: 35% Discount
Clinical Trial Pack: 40% Discount""The remainder of this project outline is somewhat more technical and is here for those backers who are interested in understanding the nitty-gritty science behind the project, everyone else is encouraged to proceed to the funding tab and lend us your assistance.

Natural health products' (NHP) capacity to address neurodegeneration is well documented in the scientific literature. This should not be surprising since the increase in neurodegenerative diseases followed revolutionary changes in Western diets that resulted in an exponential rise in the consumption of highly processed foods, which either lack the appropriate nutrients for long-term support of the central nervous system (CNS) and systemic metabolic functions, or contain added ingredients that impair protective actions of natural food substances. (Moving forward with nutrition in Alzheimer's disease. Scheltens, 2009)Current research in academia are leading to a greater understanding of the underlying pathologies causing many
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Parkinson’s disease. Implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, is the compromise of the Mitochondria via an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to oxidative damage. ROS (e.g. superoxides and hydrogen peroxide) are created during respiration - the process by which cells convert the nutrients we consume into energy, specifically Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Respiration itself takes place in the Mitochondria.
Impairment of the Mitochondria leads to reduce ATP production and increased ROS production. This in turn leads to cellular inflammation, protein aggregation,  mutant DNA formation, as well as other neurodegenerations. As a result of these neurodegenerative processes, the body's own immune system get turned against the impaired neuronal cells, causing further damages that can lead to neuronial demyelination and eventually cell death. (Mitochondrial Medicine for Aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases.
Reddy, 2008; Is multiple sclerosis a mitochondrial disease? Mao et al., 2009). 
Another fascinating finding from preclinical research is that excessive cholestrol build-up in brain tissue resembles early stage Alzheimer's disease (Increasing membrane cholesterol of neurons in culture recapitulates Alzheimer’s disease early phenotypes. Marquer et al. 2014)
Interestingly, if neurogenerative diseases are actual metabolic diseases, it's possible that they have their origins not in the brain, but rather in a distant organ, namely the liver. Ceramides build-up in the liver can migrate to the brain where it causes insulin insensitivity. Insulin is an extremely important hormone that's produced in the pancreas and which is involved in numerous metabolic processes, including ATP production in the Mitochondria  (Sphingolipids, insulin resistance, and metabolic disease: new insights from in vivo manipulation of sphingolipid metabolism.  Holland et al. 
2008).
Ceramides are are a family of waxy lipid molecules containing, sphingolipids, which are toxic to neuronal cells. They are lipid signaling molecules that causeinsulin resistance by activating pro-inflammatory cytokines. (Insulin-like growth factor-1-dependent maintenance of neuronal metabolism through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway is inhibited by C2-ceramide in CAD cells. Gibson 2007) 
A final note on ceramides, if you have neurodegeneration and don't think ceramides are implicated, you may want to answer this question. Do you have Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NFLD); this is where you have an apparent beer belly without being a major beer drinker? NFLD is a dysfunction of the liver, and long before your gut started protruding, your liver was pumping out ceramides into your brain, (Role of Ceramides in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Pagadala et al. 2012)
That initial insulin insensitivity brought on by the invading ceramides from the liver could be what starts the entire neurodegeneration cascade. That nudge causes the Mitochondria to misfire like a sputtering engine producing too much smoke (ROS) for the antioxidants in the cells to extinguish and not enough power (ATP) to give each cellular component enough energy to execute their respective tasks (the brain only makes up 2% of our body mass, but consumes 20% of the energy our body produces). Once the process builds up steam, it becomes like a runaway train or an avalanche.

 

Why should you believe that we can successfully complete this project?
Well, in one word... EXPERIENCED! Put simply, we have traveled this developmental pathway before, successfully. COORGA Nutraceuticals is one of the relative few US registered dietary supplements developers with products sold in stores in Canada. This is because all natural health products (NHP) legally sold in Canada must first receive a license from Health Canada. Before such license are granted, the NHP undergoes an extensive review to assess both its efficacy and safety. 
Health Canada is widely regarded as one of the toughest regulators of NHP with an approval rate of 40% as of 2010, the last time figures were available.COORGA Nutraceuticals has developed some innovative treatments in the past despite an environment replete with naysayers. 



TumorDefence™, is a NHP we developed as an adjuvant treatment for chemo and radiation therapy, with an indication for fighting cancer metastasis. It employs the body's own immune capacity to fight tumor growth. TumorDefence™ is currently undergoing Health Canada evaluation for sale in Canada. 
**Those looking for an effective therapeutic tool to complement  their current treatment regime to target tumors, should check out the ""I hate Cancer""  perk to the right.**

Our product brainJOLT!™, was first developed for a good friend who was always complaining about feeling incredibly fatigued, unfortunately, she has since been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. She is also the reason we decided to tackle the problem of neurodegeneration; we have no desired to see her confined to a wheelchair, especially not when we have the capabilities to prevent it from happening. brainJOLT!™ worked so well for her that we expanded its capabilities to boost short-term working memory among other things. Today brainJOLT!™  is the only  NHP approved by Health Canada  with an indication to boost working memory, not just the wish-washy claim of ""supporting"" working memory, our product actually boosts it.
** Do you have a neurodegenerative disease that leaves you fatigued all the time? Then check 
out the featured perk  ""Perk Me Up, I am Fatigued"" to the right.**

Finally, we were the first to develop a dietary supplement (Grey Defence®)
 shown to reverse greying, for which we have a US patent. This product 
was also approved by Health Canada to re-mediate cellular oxidative 
stress and lipid peroxidation caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This product works best for people who started greying within 7 years of when they started using it. Essentially, normal greying is due to oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation caused by ROS (specifically, hydrogen peroxide) build-up at the base of the hair follicle. The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) bleaches the follicle as it grows while preventing the hair from being able to repair itself. Removing the H2O2 stops these processes and since the hair follicle is still producing melanin, hair color returns overtime. For those following closely, you will note the similarity in terms of ROS dysfunction remediation approved for Grey Defence® as those proposed herein. The main difference being that Grey Defence® targets oxidative stress in hair follicle cells, while the multi-functional therapeutic agent will target oxidative stress in neuronal cells.


Despite the achievements listed above, you should be aware that the FTC has sued COORGA Nutraceuticals and its principals, claiming there is no scientific basis for our products. Yeah... we don't understand their thinking either, even if they think our conclusions are wrong (though they aren't), this still does not make what we are doing not science. After all science, is a methodology, that's why it's oft referred to as the scientific method (oh well. maybe they think we are 
doing voodoo or something else magical). At any rate, we have refused their offer to settle out of court and are aggressively defending our products and our good name in court.

It's important to keep in mind that this project is one that is a research and development (R&D) effort. R&D by its nature is risky and this one is no different. Specific risks to consider are: 

 The inability to overcome the inherent limitations of the compounds in question, as a result, failing in our effort to optimize their oral bioavailability to create an enhanced bioparticle that survives travel through the digestive system. Even if we create an enhance bioparticle, this particle may be such that it fails to transit the blood brain barrier (BBB). Failure to transit the BBB means that the bioparticle would not be able to get into the neurons to deliver its payloads.
Even if the bioparticle is efficient at transiting the BBB and releasing its payload, that payload may be ineffective in initiating any useful therapeutic effects with regard to neurodegeneration.
Finally, even if the bioparticle efficiently transit the BBB, delivers an effective payload that remediate certain aspects of neurodegeneration, the bioparticle itself or the compounds it contains, may be cytotoxic, making it a poor therapy overall.

To address these risks and challenges we have divided the overall project into four (4) primary phases outlined below.
 

PHASE ONE
BioParticle Development
Budget: $20,000

In this first phase of the project, we will seek to develop a highly orally bioavailable bioparticle containing Trehalose.  
In lab experiments on animal models, the injection of Trehalose has been shown to significantly increase autophagy. Trehalose is the sugar used to sweeten chewing gum. Unfortunately, when taken orally, it is broken down within the stomach, the intestine and blood serum to glucose, loosing any inherent therapeutic value long before it can get anywhere near the central nervous system.  
Autophagy is how cells rid themselves of unwanted debris such as damaged proteins, microorganisms, etc.
Trehalose is aggressively digested and converted into glucose, this occurs in the stomach, the intestines and blood serum. Oral supplementation with Trehalose leads to negligible serum/cellular bioavailability. 
The goal of this initial step is to develop a biocompatible, bioavailable particle that mostly survives the journey through the digestive tract intact. 
Milestone: 
1) Lab report from third party lab showing whether the bioparticles successfully exists the digestive tract and enters the body proper.

PHASE TWO
Bio-Particle Optimization 
Budget: $25,000
The molecules of natural health products are not renown for their ability to transist the BBB because they are generally too large and too insoluble. Big pharma employs techniques such as nanorization (particle size in the nanometer range) and surface modifications to make drugs better able to transit the BBB, these techniques are well documented in the scientific literature.
Neuronal cells are cordon off by the BBB and presents a challenge for NHP compounds to transit.  

The goal of this phase is to optimize the bioparticle such that it can efficiently transit the BBB. As in the previous phase, we will be drawing heavily on well documented pharmaceutical manufacturing techniques to help us optimized the bioparticle for efficient BBB transit.
Milestone: Third party Lab reports using animal models to:
1) Optimized bioparticle that transits the BBB. 
2) Pharmacokinetic study assessing the toxicological profile of the
Optimized bioparticle.


PHASE THREE
Fully Multi-functional Therapeutic Agent (MfT-A)
Budget: $90,000

One very important conclusion that can be drawn from a review of current research in neurodegenerative diseases is that the concept of using mono-therapy (a Big Pharma preference, using patented compounds) to treat neurodegernation is wrong, and instead, multiple targets must be attacked simultaneously and over a prolonged period of time. (Why pleiotropic interventions are needed for Alzheimer's disease, Frautschy et al. 2010).This is where the multi-functional therapeutic agent comes in.
In this phase of the project, the previously optimized bioparticles will be complexed with other compounds to develop a multi-functional therapeutic agent to slow, stop and/or reverse the underlying pathological pathways that leads to neurodegeneration.
Specifically we will be adding Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Curcumin, Catalase and thirty additional compounds to the original Trehalose bioparticle.
Neurodegeneration does not have only one causatory element, therefore attacking only on a single dimension (e.g. aberrant inflammatory response) will not be sufficient. The problem needs to be attacked from multiple angles to reflect the multiple pathways to possible dysfunctions (e.g. oxidative stress, protein & DNA mutation, aberrant inflammation, demyelation, impaired autophagy, insulin resistance, transition metal ions build-up, cholesterol build-up, liver ceramides build-up, activated microglia macrophages, etc.). The additional thirty plus compounds were selected because in preclinical or clinical research they showed either a moderate to significant impact on one of these causative elements. 
In this phase we will broaden out the therapy to include additional key natural compounds that addresses additional areas that leads to neurodegeneration. 
Milestone: 
1) Multi-functional therapeutic agent. 
2) Toxicology safety report on multi-functional therapeutic agent.
PHASE FOUR
Assess Multi-functional Therapeutic Agent Against Disease Models
Budget: (see sub-phase)
Sub-phase
a) Alzheimer's disease = $150,000
b) Multiple Sclerosis = $75,000

This, the validation stage is where the rubber hits the road. In this phase we try to answer the question as to whether the multi-functional therapeutic agent we developed through phases 1 - 3 is able to preform as an effective advanced neuroprotectant & neurodegeneration remediator.  To help us to answer this question we will employ two (2) classical models of neurodegeneration, namely the Alzheimer's disease animal model and the Multiple Sclerosis disease animal model
The multi-functional therapeutic agent (MfT-A) will be a dietary supplement not a drug, as a result, there are legal restrictions placed on what can be claimed. 
In the US, a dietary supplement cannot claim to prevent, treat or cure any specific disease. 
In Canada, all dietary supplements must receive pre-approval from Health Canada before they can be sold. As a result of this more rigorous approval process, dietary supplements (NHPs) are permitted to make disease prevention, treatment and cure claims to the general public. However, Canada has a blanket prohibition on any drug, device, food or NHP from making any treatment or cure claims covering a limited list of diseases found on Schedule A of the Canadian Food and Drug Act, these are generally referred to as Schedule A Diseases. Prohibitions notwithstanding, with approval, a NHP may be permitted to make disease prevention claims for a Schedule A disease. Please note, these prohibitions on Schedule A diseases are only for marketing and advertising to the general public and do not apply to health care practitioners (e.g. doctors, pharmacists, etc.). 
The goal, therefore, of the preclinical studies will be to assess whether the MfT-A have any impact on the underlying neurodegeneration that can cause these diseases and not whether it treats the diseases themselves. 

Therefore the questions we hope to answer in each mouse model concerning the neurodegeneration are:
Does the MfT-A accelerate the removal of mutant/damage proteins, damaged or inactivated mitochondria, etc.?

Does the MfT-A reduce oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation markers?
Does the MfT-A reduces the markers for aberrant inflammation and inappropriate cytokine activation?

Does the MfT-A enhances remyelation of neuronal cells?

Does the MfT-A reduces the amount of ceramides present in the brain?

Does the MfT-A bring about an increase in the average survival time of treated animals as compared to controls?

Does the MfT-A bring about an improvement in social measures for the animals (more happy, energetic, etc.)?

What is the appropriate dose to see an impact (low, medium, high)?

Milestone: Lab reports answering the questions above on each disease state reviewed.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The innovation of this new

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This concept works as a smart
rudder or a wing modern plane, that modifies and adjusts its attack angle to follow the trajectory sought.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">GENOME
fin adapts itself to
various phases, turns or accelerations of the surfer on waves. This aeronautics
system, unique and patented, optimizes the profile and the direction
angle of the fin by combining ideally the properties of five materials that
compose it.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The auto-orientability of the
GENOME reduce the distance necessary to perform a move. Indeed the fin adapts itself at the movement generated by the surfer during
a curve,  during a below wave move or a
radical up move.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The adaptive camber of GENOME
allows to offer extreme hangs during radical curves.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">All of this, associated at a

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In rapid waves sections, when
the surfer sticks to the wave in research of

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the paddling, the

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the beginning, we were far from considering the invention of a new type of
surf fin, since there is already a lot of models and we did not claim to be
able to do better than what exists. We were just curious to
understand how our fins work; to take the best of our
sessions. Each answer generated even more questions and we
realized that a dynamic aspect seemed relevant in the evolution of fins. To go
to the end of our idea, we applied this principle in a series of prototypes to
validate this. To objectively measure the efficiency of ADAC SYSTEM ™, we made comparative tests in wake-surfing conditions
with a constant wave for better measures, results were clear: this new type of
fin provides natural dynamics trajectories and purely instinctive pulses! It
was just impossible to go back to our static fins! So we decided to share this
feeling and create an evolved version, that met all the expectations of new
sensations a surfer is looking for: FYN™ and
his GENOME™ starts here.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we need you!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Surfing is a passion, a sport, a work for some! It has
to evolve, mutate, to improve to provide more feelings of pleasure and moments
to share.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For us it's important to share this adventure with the
surfing community, to contribute at his expansion, by making our dream part in
the surf evolution.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Notre histoire</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Au début, nous étions loin
d'envisager l'invention d'un nouveau type d'aileron, car il en existait déjà de
nombreux modèles et nous n'avions pas la prétention de pouvoir faire mieux que
ce que le marché proposait. Nous étions simplement curieux d'approfondir notre
compréhension du fonctionnement des ailerons qui équipent nos planches, afin de
profiter au mieux de nos sessions. Le travail opposé des ailerons latéraux,
ainsi que la traînée engendrée par leurs angles soulevaient chez nous des
questionnements. Chaque réponse amenait de nouvelles questions et nous avons
pris conscience que la dynamique des ailerons devait être revue afin
que ceux-ci évoluent de manière optimale. Afin d'aller au bout de notre réflexion, nous avons donc appliqué ce
principe dans une série de prototypes pour valider ce constat. Pour mesurer
objectivement l'efficacité de l’ADAC SYSTEM™, des tests comparatifs ont été
effectués en <i>wake surf</i> sur des
conditions de vague constante pour de meilleures mesures. Le résultat fut sans
appel : ce nouveau type d'aileron procurait une dynamique naturelle de
trajectoires grâce à ses impulsions purement instinctives! Il était impossible
pour nous de revenir à des ailerons classiques! Nous avons donc naturellement
décidé de partager cette découverte et d’en créer une version évoluée répondant
à toutes les attentes d'un surfeur en recherche de nouvelles sensations. C’est
ici que commence l’histoire de FYN et de son GENOME.</p>

The technology developed by FYN™ and
implanted in GENOME™ fin has the ambition to be part
of surf evolution in providing more
performance and surfing sensations than never before.



The innovation of this new
generation of surf fin resides in the ""ADAPTIVE & DYNAMICS ATTACK & CAMBER"" technology developed by FYN(Patent n°14/02226).
This concept works as a smart
rudder or a wing modern plane, that modifies and adjusts its attack angle to follow the trajectory sought.
GENOME
fin adapts itself to
various phases, turns or accelerations of the surfer on waves. This aeronautics
system, unique and patented, optimizes the profile and the direction
angle of the fin by combining ideally the properties of five materials that
compose it.



The auto-orientability of the
GENOME reduce the distance necessary to perform a move. Indeed the fin adapts itself at the movement generated by the surfer during
a curve,  during a below wave move or a
radical up move.



The adaptive camber of GENOME
allows to offer extreme hangs during radical curves.
All of this, associated at a
minimal loss of energy, provides to the surfer an optimal speed for an amazing
return to the top of the wave.



In rapid waves sections, when
the surfer sticks to the wave in research of
speed, the lesser component of vertical skid is exploited by the fin to propels the surfer.





The ""ADAPTIVE & DYNAMICS ATTACK & CAMBER"" technology integrates a unique property: each laterals movements applied at
GENOME is transcribed in projection. A surfer performing a pump movement will be powered as never before! GENOME acts like a caudal
shark or a dolphin fin, that provides an animal surf sensation.



During the paddling, the
alternative movements of arms generates
natural ondulations
that, associated with the fin, create a movement pushing forward: ideal before the take-off or during a fast placement to
the peak.



During a fall, or in too crowded
surf spot, the classic fin is the first enemy for a surfer. That's why, in agreement with the efficiency, we can
offer a safe product.
That is possible through:
- an articulate shape
- a smooth and flex skin
- fuzes parts that protect the
surfer from his board and possible impacts
and his fin fixation box.



Made of technical materials, GENOME ensures an amazing hydrodynamic
quality and a durability.
Optimized to withstand wear and impacts, GENOME will give
you best sensations and performances for a long time!


Risk and challenges

Together with our industrial
technology specialists network, we have developed a product 100% made in
France, efficient, durable and eco-friendly.
Our story


At the beginning, we were far from considering the invention of a new type of
surf fin, since there is already a lot of models and we did not claim to be
able to do better than what exists. We were just curious to
understand how our fins work; to take the best of our
sessions. Each answer generated even more questions and we
realized that a dynamic aspect seemed relevant in the evolution of fins. To go
to the end of our idea, we applied this principle in a series of prototypes to
validate this. To objectively measure the efficiency of ADAC SYSTEM ™, we made comparative tests in wake-surfing conditions
with a constant wave for better measures, results were clear: this new type of
fin provides natural dynamics trajectories and purely instinctive pulses! It
was just impossible to go back to our static fins! So we decided to share this
feeling and create an evolved version, that met all the expectations of new
sensations a surfer is looking for: FYN™ and
his GENOME™ starts here.

Why we need you!

Surfing is a passion, a sport, a work for some! It has
to evolve, mutate, to improve to provide more feelings of pleasure and moments
to share.
For us it's important to share this adventure with the
surfing community, to contribute at his expansion, by making our dream part in
the surf evolution.
To complete this adventure of GENOME, all contributions: professionals, amateurs, beginners, are essentials for FYN.
Give us your
opinion and share our project on social networks and on your spot!
What is already done

The technical development is now completed, the technology
was validated, patented (Patent No. 14 / 02,226) and the model registered (No.
15/1713).

___________________________________________________________________________
La  technologie  implantée
dans l'aileron GENOME™ de FYN™  a l'ambition de s'inscrire dans
l'évolution du surf, en procurant une performance optimale et une sensation de
glisse hors du commun, jamais atteinte auparavant.
L'innovation
de cette nouvelle génération d'aileron de surf réside dans la technologie "" ADAPTIVE & DYNAMICS ATTACK & CAMBER "" développée par FYN  (Patent
n°14/02226). 
Cet aileron innovant fonctionne comme
une aile d'avion moderne qui modifie sa forme et ajuste son angle d'attaque selon
la trajectoire recherchée. L'aileron GENOME s'adapte
ainsi aux diverses phases, virages ou accélérations du surfeur sur la
vague. Ce système aéronautique, unique et breveté,
optimise le profil et la direction de l'aileron, en combinant idéalement
les propriétés des 5 matériaux qui le composent.





L'auto-orientation
du GENOME réduit la distance nécessaire à n'importe quel surf pour effectuer
une manœuvre. En effet, l'aileron s'adapte au mouvement généré par le surfeur
lors d'une courbe, aussi bien en bas de vague que lors d'une manœuvre radicale
en haut de vague.




Le
cambre adaptatif du GENOME lui permet d'offrir une accroche extrême lors des
courbes radicales.
Ces avantages, associés à une perte minimale
d'énergie, confèrent au surfeur une vitesse incroyable lors d'un retour en haut
de vague.





Dans les sections de vagues rapides,
lorsque le surfeur colle à la paroi en recherche de vitesse, la moindre
composante de dérapage vertical est exploitée par l'aileron de FYN et propulse
le surfeur.




La technologie "" ADAPTIVE & DYNAMICS ATTACK & CAMBER "" possède une propriété unique :
chaque mouvement latéral appliqué au GENOME est retranscrit en projection vers
l'avant! Un surfeur effectuant un mouvement de pompe se verra alors propulsé
comme jamais! GENOME agit comme une nageoire caudale de requin ou de
dauphin, ce qui procure une sensation de glisse animale!




Lors de la rame, les mouvements alternés
des bras génèrent naturellement des ondulations qui, associées à l'aileron,
produisent une composante de propulsion. Il s’agit d’un apport idéal avant le
take-off ou lors d'un placement rapide vers le pic.




Lors d'une chute, ou dans un spot
fréquenté, l'aileron classique est l'ennemi numéro 1 du surfeur. C’est
pourquoi nous proposons un produit hautement sécuritaire tout en étant
extrêmement performant, notamment
grâce à :
- une
structure articulée ;
- une peau en
matière souples ; 
- des pièces fusibles protégeant ainsi
le corps du surfeur mais aussi sa  planche lors de collisions pouvant
arracher les boîtiers de fixation.






Constitué de matériaux issus
de l'aéronautique, GENOME assure une hydrodynamique et une durabilité de
qualité « marine ». 
Optimisé mécaniquement pour résister à
l'usure et validé sur banc d’essais de fatigue,  le GENOME atteindra un
niveau de performance et vous fera vivre des sensations de glisse inégalées pendant
longtemps!






Risques et défis


Grâce à notre réseau de spécialistes en
techniques industrielles et en matériaux, nous avons pu développer un produit
fabriqué 100 % en France, performant, durable et écoresponsable.



Notre histoire

Au début, nous étions loin
d'envisager l'invention d'un nouveau type d'aileron, car il en existait déjà de
nombreux modèles et nous n'avions pas la prétention de pouvoir faire mieux que
ce que le marché proposait. Nous étions simplement curieux d'approfondir notre
compréhension du fonctionnement des ailerons qui équipent nos planches, afin de
profiter au mieux de nos sessions. Le travail opposé des ailerons latéraux,
ainsi que la traînée engendrée par leurs angles soulevaient chez nous des
questionnements. Chaque réponse amenait de nouvelles questions et nous avons
pris conscience que la dynamique des ailerons devait être revue afin
que ceux-ci évoluent de manière optimale. Afin d'aller au bout de notre réflexion, nous avons donc appliqué ce
principe dans une série de prototypes pour valider ce constat. Pour mesurer
objectivement l'efficacité de l’ADAC SYSTEM™, des tests comparatifs ont été
effectués en wake surf sur des
conditions de vague constante pour de meilleures mesures. Le résultat fut sans
appel : ce nouveau type d'aileron procurait une dynamique naturelle de
trajectoires grâce à ses impulsions purement instinctives! Il était impossible
pour nous de revenir à des ailerons classiques! Nous avons donc naturellement
décidé de partager cette découverte et d’en créer une version évoluée répondant
à toutes les attentes d'un surfeur en recherche de nouvelles sensations. C’est
ici que commence l’histoire de FYN et de son GENOME.

Pourquoi nous avons besoins de vous!

Le surf est une passion, un sport, même
un métier pour certains! Il se doit d'évoluer, de s'améliorer, pour fournir
toujours plus de sensations de plaisir et de moments de partage.
Pour nous, il est essentiel de partager
cette aventure avec la communauté surf et de contribuer à son expansion, en
apportant notre part de rêve dans l'évolution du surf.
Nous sollicitons votre contribution
dans le but de maximiser l’expérience de GENOME. Toutes les contributions, de
professionnels, d'amateurs, ou de débutants sont précieuses pour FYN. Donnez-nous
votre avis et partagez notre projet via les réseaux sociaux et sur vos spots!

Le développement technique du produit
est désormais terminé; la technologie a été testée, validée,
brevetée (Patent n°14/02226), et le modèle déposé (n°15/1713).
Les premiers
prototypes industriels sont actuellement en phase de test final. 
Si vous souhaitez participer à ces
tests, n'hésitez pas à nous contacter pour recevoir votre exemplaire de test et
contribuer à l'évolution du projet.


Ce qu'il nous reste à faire

<p>Hi Everyone, I'm Marta, I'm a senior in University of West Hungary, studying painting. I tend to find hobbies certainly not related to my job, it was the same with the blog. I was diagnosed with <span>hypothyroidism</span> about a year ago, it was pretty obvious that something was going on, I had huge migraines about 3-4 times a week, I gained a lot of weight and was tired all the time around my 24th birthday, my right sided  <span>thyroid</span> popped and got huge, I was rushed into the emergency by my boyfriend and was in the hospital all night. All my symptoms were clear but ""not as bad"" so I did not get treated ... Then it all made sense, I needed to change my lifestyle. It took me some time, about half a year (but you need time for the good work right?) So it took me about 5-6 months, I started, a daily blog, ""Csípős Fahéj"" (which means Spicy Cinnamon in Hungarian, writing down all my thoughts, about eating clean, being healthy, finding our own way of
 feeling good about ourselves .</p>
<p>I got better, I lost 15 kilos already, I rarely get headaches (well about 3-4 a month) I feel motivated and good about myself. <br/></p>
<p>While daily motivating other people, helping 
them, giving them advices on how to start off a healthy - on a daily 
bases - life. It turned out, people actually liked the idea, so I snooped 
around in the era and got to know clean eating, raw vegan, vegan and vegetarian food and lifestyles as well, so when people tell me about themselves I try to help them create what's best for them, in their own needs. <br/></p>
<p>I also started to make facial, body and hair creams with 
only organic oils and base butters. I uploaded all of my organic cream 
recipes and my followers loved them, I even started to create gluten, 
sugar, lactose free meals and deserts to improve the intake of my followers and my 
level of thinking about eating good food. <br/><br/>I believe that, being healthy 
comes from what we put inside AND onto our bodies. My  main purpose of the idea is a better, improved website for my blog where I can help more easily 
everyone 24/7 , whom would ask for help. Whether it's just a piece 
of advice, a whole month of a meal idea, ideal daily calorie intake, 
personal shampoo - conditioner or body/ facial butter personally made 
for the person who asks for it.</p>

It took me some time, about half a year (but you need time for the good work right?) So it took me about 5-6 months, I started, a daily blog, ""Csípős Fahéj"" (which means Spicy Cinnamon in Hungarian, writing down all my thoughts, about eating clean, being healthy, finding our own way of
 feeling good about ourselves .
I got better, I lost 15 kilos already, I rarely get headaches (well about 3-4 a month) I feel motivated and good about myself. 
While daily motivating other people, helping 
them, giving them advices on how to start off a healthy - on a daily 
bases - life. It turned out, people actually liked the idea, so I snooped 
around in the era and got to know clean eating, raw vegan, vegan and vegetarian food and lifestyles as well, so when people tell me about themselves I try to help them create what's best for them, in their own needs. 
I also started to make facial, body and hair creams with 
only organic oils and base butters. I uploaded all of my organic cream 
recipes and my followers loved them, I even started to create gluten, 
sugar, lactose free meals and deserts to improve the intake of my followers and my 
level of thinking about eating good food. I believe that, being healthy 
comes from what we put inside AND onto our bodies. My  main purpose of the idea is a better, improved website for my blog where I can help more easily 
everyone 24/7 , whom would ask for help. Whether it's just a piece 
of advice, a whole month of a meal idea, ideal daily calorie intake, 
personal shampoo - conditioner or body/ facial butter personally made 
for the person who asks for it.
My dream is to create a place where I can  help people with all my heart and time and this is it. Please, please help me create my dream and donate to my campaign, Thank you so much!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>My project started years ago, when I began
dreaming of facility that would house our community swim teams in the Olentangy
School District.  I wanted a facility that focused on the education of
swimmers of all ages and interests.  There are a few fitness centers in
the area that just don’t ‘get’ swimming.  They teach lessons, host swim
teams but in a mixed use facility this all ends up overcrowded and just not
enough.  I wanted a place where swim lesson kids could have their own
warmer pool.  A place where a swim team can train like athletes, not
recreational participants.  I understood that such a place would not be
publicly funded.  So, here we are.  I &amp; Buckeye Swim Club, now
own 10 acres at 1895 Peachblow Rd.  The architects are busy doing their
thing and sending me bills!  The bank LIKES my project (woohoo)!  I
will try to update this site with pics, drawings, funding information and
everything in between.</p>

<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The project currently needs about $30,000 more to pay the
rest of our architect and engineering fees.  We are hoping to raise a
portion of that here.  We have lots of perks, from t-shirts to a wave with
your name on our pool wall!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Central Ohio area has 65 High School teams, but only 6
high schools have pools on their campus.  3 are public, 3 are private.
 The taxpayers just don't build education based swim facilities.
 Most high schools and swim clubs rent time at local fitness facilities
such as the YMCA.  Our club  (Buckeye Swim Club) rents time at 3
different pools each winter just to house our kiddos.  This facility will
impact most of Southern Delaware County in such a positive way.  Swim
teams aside, our swim lessons will help educate thousands of local children and
keep them safe near the water!</p>
<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p>We have already purchased land and a dome to enclose the
facility. We are well on our way!  Our next challenge is finishing the architectural
&amp; engineering and getting the building permits in place.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you would like to help with donated goods rather than
funds, please let us know!  We will take anything from locker room
supplies, to exercise equipment to pool supplies and equipment.  Goods donors

<p><b>                           Jackie’s Cannabis
Sanctuary, a healing retreat</b></p>
<p><b>Objective:</b></p>
<p>Establish a safe secure peaceful retreat in the Colorado
Mountains.  Specifically for patients and
students to learn about the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of the cannabis
plant. This would include, growing and harvesting the plant.  Learning how the different strains have
different properties. Making the extracts, tinctures, and concentrates for the
patients to use.  Teaching about healthy
diet including a large food-producing garden. Teaching about the spiritual side
of using the plant.  And much more.  We envision gifted guest teachers from all over the
world coming to teach their craft. </p>
<p><b>Location:</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://townofpaonia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paonia, Colorado</a> area.</p>
<p>Paonia is the self-proclaimed capital of farm to table
restaurants. It is also home to many small organic farms, fruit tree orchards,
and wine producing vineyards.  It is in
Colorado’s banana belt and protected on both sides by the Elk Mountain range.
It has a great alternative lifestyle vibe and a very friendly population of
1600+.  Land and homes are still
affordable being near the national average whereas much of Colorado is higher
then that average due to the popularity of out of state investors and
buyers.  Once Delta County accepts
medical and or recreational cannabis we predict the prices will go up and be
equal to the rest of the state. </p>
<p><b>Costs:</b></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Property              $350,000.00</span></p>
<p>Improvements  $250,000.00</p>
<p>Property would consist of 10 to 20 acres with main
house.  Assuming 20% down the up front
cost for this would be $70,000.00 down and approx. a $1300.00 monthly mortgage
payment.  </p>
<p>Improvements include building green houses, several cabins,
and a bunk house/classroom.  Some land
improvements including fencing , etc., would round out the improvement costs.  This figure is based on Exhibit A. (see below)</p>
<p><b>Income:</b></p>
<p>Each student or patient would pay an all inclusive $100.00 per day/night.  With room for 20+ students and or patients
total this could easily be $2000.00 per day.  Even at
a 50% occupancy rate, it would be $1000.00 per day or $30,000.00 per
month.  At 25% occupancy it is still
$15,000.00 a month.  With a couple of
employee’s, mortgage payment, supplies and upkeep, we expect a positive cash
flow almost from the beginning.  With
crowd funding supplying the Improvements cost there should be a lot of equity
in the property from the opening.  We hope to offer stays to some that can't afford it as well.  Their stay will be on us as it is the right thing to do. </p>         <b><i>Goal of Indiegogo fund raising campaign should be

the loving person to care for the elderly in their time of need. I enjoy
helping and caring for people. Shortly after our marriage in 2007, my husband

For instance, you notice that they are experiencing weight loss due to poor eating habits, poor hygiene and housekeeping, urinary problems, strong smell of urine in their house, unexplained injuries or bruising, frequent falls which all could be a result of neglect.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We need to raise $90k to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>'Uber for
     Wellness' Website + App:</b> A fully functional smart-device friendly
     website and app with geo-locator, calendar view, activity filters, on-line registration/ survey/ donation, automatic notifications and teacher payment etc. is $55K total. We've had it quoted from
     five sources (with a history of creating this kind of web and app) and this is the best we found. It needs to be simple and easy to use,
     otherwise people will not use it.</li>
<li>
<b>Press &amp; Publicity:</b> $25K will go towards
     implementing a viral marketing strategy in the initial launch cities. This
     is actually in the low end of what is required to do this properly (we got
     this quoted four times).</li>
<li>
<b>Train Champions: </b>The remaining $10K will be
     to cover the travel and expenses for training the local champions
     properly.</li>

<p>With the funding, here is
the <b>daana</b> student experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch smart-device friendly <b>daana </b>website or app.</li>
<li>See all the 'pay-it-forward' activities in your area via geo-locator and calendar.</li>
<li>Click on any event
     for more information (e.g. picture of the space, any particular
     circumstances like stair cases, pets etc., profile of the teacher, type
     of class and space capacity).</li>
<li>If there is room, register for the class on-line, for free.</li>
<li>Two hours after the class, respond to prompt by the smart device to rate the practice, comment
     and offer an on-line donation (safer than cash, environmentally friendly and
     hassle free).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">48 hours after each class an email is automatically sent to the respective teacher and champion, with a review of the
     class. 90% of the revenue generated from that class is sent directly to the respective teacher's

 daana (Google Non-Profit ID: 344-054-1563) provides 'pay-it-forward' wellness activities in spaces that are donated by people all around the world . 


Join us with this game-changer movement for creating generous and healthy communities worldwide!

Hi, my name is Bhaskar, and I would like to introduce you to daana:


What:
wellness : open-source  .  by-donation  .  world-wide

How:



Why:



Health: Time, distance, money and any kind of self-perceived
     limitations are no longer reasons to not practice.


Generosity: The word 'daana' means “cultivating
     the virtue of generosity by giving”. Generosity is the antidote to stress. You cannot be
     stressed and generous at the same time.


Community: Built on a foundation
     on good health, wisdom and compassion, the classes can be yoga, meditation, dance, art, cooking, Tai Chi,
     dialogue circles, social projects - Essentially anything 'pay-it-forward' that uplifts the human condition.


90% of the revenue from every class goes to the teachers and champions. The 10% is to cover our costs and make by-donation wellness activities available to all. The foundation of this initiative, is generosity:




Why Crowd Funding?



We need to raise $90k to pay for:


'Uber for
     Wellness' Website + App: A fully functional smart-device friendly
     website and app with geo-locator, calendar view, activity filters, on-line registration/ survey/ donation, automatic notifications and teacher payment etc. is $55K total. We've had it quoted from
     five sources (with a history of creating this kind of web and app) and this is the best we found. It needs to be simple and easy to use,
     otherwise people will not use it.

Press & Publicity: $25K will go towards
     implementing a viral marketing strategy in the initial launch cities. This
     is actually in the low end of what is required to do this properly (we got
     this quoted four times).

Train Champions: The remaining $10K will be
     to cover the travel and expenses for training the local champions
     properly.




With the funding, here is
the daana student experience:

Launch smart-device friendly daana website or app.
See all the 'pay-it-forward' activities in your area via geo-locator and calendar.
Click on any event
     for more information (e.g. picture of the space, any particular
     circumstances like stair cases, pets etc., profile of the teacher, type
     of class and space capacity).
If there is room, register for the class on-line, for free.
Two hours after the class, respond to prompt by the smart device to rate the practice, comment
     and offer an on-line donation (safer than cash, environmentally friendly and
     hassle free).


48 hours after each class an email is automatically sent to the respective teacher and champion, with a review of the
     class. 90% of the revenue generated from that class is sent directly to the respective teacher's
     account. The teacher then contributes 20% to their local Champion.



Ancient system meets modern modern technology:

The breakdown
 At the moment, in about 6 months there are already over 22 daana classes per week around Montreal, with 8 more on the way! We know this works and that there is a demand for it. 
For phase 2, with the proper technology, we would like to pilot the project in several major national and international cities (Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Paris, Dubai, Hong Kong, etc.) 

    
Perks (revamped!)


With the proper infrastructure in place, we target having 12,500 students per week in three years. Divide the $90K funding required by 12,500; it means that, in three years, one new person will have access to daana classes, for every 7 dollars you contribute. That's the real perk :)


Also, we've put together several awesome gifts that are unique for this project. All gifts will be shipped three weeks after the end of the campaign. 




daana 'generosity' T-Shirts: This is how to win amazing friends and influence people :)



daana 'generosity' bracelet: (3 shown above) Made with rose quartz (unconditional love), bodhi seeds (wisdom), onyx (resilience) and sandalwood (inner peace). Made only for this Indiegogo campaign, so that we can recognize each other on the streets ;)

 daana 'generosity' impact resistant glass bottle: (2 shown above) How gorgeous is this! (buh-bye plastic)


Open Yoga practice CD: Taught by multiple award winning 'yogi-preneur' and daana (and BODHI) founder Bhaskar Goswami, with live original music by four-time grammy nominated Adrian Carr. The art of seduction - just have one of these lying around on your coffee table :)
Other gifts: We will be hosting a Legacy Weekend Retreat at Le Couvent in the beautiful mountain village of Val Morin (lecouventvalmorin.com) in Quebec, Canada. This is where you can meet all the key daana supporters and together we explore the theme of 'legacy'. This includes meals, accommodation, weekend retreat content, and transportation from Montreal YUL airport.

ASSADE is a guatemalan
NGO located in the highlands, specifically in San Andrés Itzapa, Chimaltenango.
A region with 33,000 inhabitants, where 90% belongs to the mayan ethnicity
‘kaqchikel’. Close to 75% of popolutation living in poverty, and near to 35% in
extreme poverty, it means when people survive with less than a dollar per day
and they don’t have access to cover the basic needs. ASSADE born with the dream
of a women who worked 25 years in the public health system of Guatemala, during
the civil war in the country that last for 36 years, in 1980; her brother, a
doctor who she admired was murdered. After that moment, she
noticed a lot of changes in the public health system, the transition to from
dictatorship to democracy makes the health system will deploring, reaching ruin.
In 2004 she decided to fund ASSADE, a non governmental and non profit
organization, dedicated to promoting health and sustainable development,
quality and social justice, especially in the maternal and child group living
in poverty and extreme poverty. Her biggest dream is to built a entire health
center to cover all people who need it, she wants to name the center after her
brother, and she hopes not to die before seeing his dream come true.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>ASSADE bases its actions on
the belief that health care is a constitutive right of human beings and to
address the psycho-social needs of individuals, families and communities. We
understand development as the possibility that the different groups,
ethnicities and cultures are free agents of their own destiny to economic,
social and political level, with the ultimate aim the realization of women and
men. ASSADE began as a only primary health clinic for two years, then it was possible
to creat a very tiny pharmacy. Nowadays ASSADE has four clinics, two of them
function in regular daily bases, one clinic to different purposes, once a month
for example we have a day dedicated to the gynecological branch (pap testing,
IUD method, ultrasounds, cryotherapy) or sometimes with volunteers of other
specialties like physicology, physiotherapy, pediatrics, cardiology, among
others. The other clinic will be for dental care, we still haven’t opened for
resources but we hope in a near future it will be ready. ASSADE has a pharmacy,
a recovery room, a warehouse, dining room and an office. We still pay rent for
the facilities, because we have no resources to buy land and begin construction
of the center. ASSADE is formed by a group of six people. ASSADE covers around
900 people monthly, people only pay a donation fee for consultation and meds
according to their possibilities. </p>
<p>In 2011 we started working on
prevention, that we believe is very important to cover and implement a project
in the communities. We realise that is quite necessary to reach progress and
human well being, through years we identified three prevailing conditions:
respiratory problems, gastrointestinal problems and malnutrition. We looked for
the real causes and started working on this, that’s how the prevention project
was born. To explain what the project is about, we will share you a short
story. </p>

<p>We want you to meet<b><i> Lesbia
Micá, </i></b>she is an indigenous women of the community in San Andrés Itzapa. She has 4
childrens, a 3 boys and a girl. She lives in small land property of her mother
in law. As most of the families in the region,
the family of Lesbia have access to water one hour every two days, unfortunately
the water of the region isn’t drinkable, comes directly from the rivers with
high levels of contamination. Her childs suffer from constant diarrhea and
serious gastrointestinal infections (second cause of death in childrens under 7
years old in the region). She as an adult suffer less, but even so, at least
three times a year she contracts an intestinal infection. </p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Rivers in the región as
used as a dump because the governamental service of waste disposal only covers
1% of the population, and the rest by private services, this only reach the 8%
of population. One of the main reason of the low percentage is the cost.
Lesbia’s husban is a farmer with an income of US$ 2 per day, so they used to
cover the greatest need (food), as they live far from the river they get rid of
the garbage burning it or throwing in the cesspool. First stage of the project,
considering the evidence of the water problem in the region, ASSADE donated a
water purifier to Lesbia’s family, also teach them how to use it and give it
maintenance. Lesbia atended during two month once a week to receive trainings
related to the water problem, related diseases, prevention mesuares, cycle of
water, general hygiene, and environmental conservation. </span><br/></p>

works with group of women, that mean that first we stablished a group of women
with the common needs, at the beginning women join with fear, but with the
mental image of receiving a benefit, turns out that the guatemalan government
bases its projects in giving away things. As the conditions of living of the
women are precarious, they see that an alternative to cover they needs. It took
a long time to change that mind, awareness of that kind of solutions only helps
in a timely manner, but not a long term solution; or the solution isn’t based
in the real problem, only cover the impact of that.  Then the groups start working as an
alternative to introduced women to another environment beyond the rol of
mother-wife, we realize that starting within our homes and our community there
are differents problems involved, over time women notous that the group in
itself have a whole meaning, an space of expression, an space of trust, of
understanding, we think that every women at the group in differents moments
reach the feeling of belonging, that is awesome, because all their lives they
were taught that they only are to have childs and take care of their homes,
that they don’t have a voice or right to choose in the macho culture, the group
complete changes the ways to see life.</span><br/></p>
<p>Lesbia
also uses an open fire to cook, other risk for the health of her family,
specially she and her childrens, that passed at least nine hours every day
inside the room they used to cook. Places like this are linked to respiratory
problems, also burns and burning eyes. Respiratory problems are the first cause
of death in the region, specially in kids under seven years old. As one of the
biggest problems, ASSADE helps to built a clean stoves, <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>as a second stage of the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Open fire is more common way to cook in the región . At least 80% of the population use it. In first place because
firewood is a fuel very easy to get, nowadays in the region there are no enviromental
laws, so some families buy the firewood or dedicated working hours to get it. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The smoke in the room is insupportable and the flames are a
constant risk for Lesbia and her childrens. She only can cook one thing at the
time.

group, all the activities we carried out with a team work spirit. Her group mates help her throughout the process. Lesbia already received for two months training related to cook
with open fire, linked diseases, ways of heat transfer, environmental
conservation, cooking hygine, cultural significant of fire, how to confront the
change of the way she cooks that will change all her life style. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The new stove is
portable, it is manufactured in the workshop so we can eliminated the old way
of cooking and built the new one without waiting of drying process, and Lesbia
can start using it until finish the construction. It uses three times less
firewood, the fire chamber optimizes the fuel, is possible to cook two things
at the same time, used the griddle to make ‘tortillas’, it has two wings to
cover the absense of tables toe at in the families, it has a chimney driving
99% of smoke out side, also child protection. And it has a harmony with the
mayan culture. </span></p>

extreme poverty of families prevents them from eating full diets which meet
even minimal nutritional standards. Only having access to meager amounts of the
same food every day leads directly to malnutrition and stagnant development in
children. In the region, that is base on agricultura, they grow corn and black
beans, main ingredients of the regular diet in Guatemala. Food availability is
one of the factors that influence the quantity and quality of the products
consumed by a family. Children and women need a more varied diet. The immediate
solution that we have implemented is alternative gardens and small raising hens
farms, which work as an effective tool for the family to produce and consume
low-cost, healthy food. In addition, the family is able to work together to
produce food and future food security. This type of garden or farm and crop
establishment is directly related to the needs and preferences of each family,
always working as a group. At first, ASSADE works with groups of women,
specially in training, in a wide range of training. From healt-related issues
to ‘how to work in groups?’, covering communication skills, dispute resolution,
gender violence, physcological and emotional issues, team work, a big variety
of tools only to work in a group. Food availity is part of the third stage of
the project, in other cases the group have chosen to make handicrafts and
stablish a Little bussines, home hygiene products, this will depend on the
group. The whole idea is the economical empowerment of women, transfering tools
that they can be able to apply on their daily bases to reach a complete welfare
of their family, group and community. <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438877663/ufal8uc5m3davpc1iog7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 614.667px; height: 461px;""/></p>
<p>Other important thing in the
idea of creating and working a group, is the construction of alternatives for
living as a women, recovery all the rights as a humans they deserve, and
empowerment themselves. We confront the fact that one of the things that stop
us from development is violence, also we teach and learn, we start as students
and then become teachers, we always are learning. So, the groups exist as an
space of expression and trust for women, to discuss around all the
topics-problem that need to confront, in differents levels, space that allows
them to recover their rights, practicing in their households and community, a
group able to do political impact, inspired on protect and promote women beyond
the alienating role, considering the environment, freedom, dignity and social
peace to change lives, an space to share suffering. ASSADE created this idea of
working with women groups, based that they can exist as a community union that
can allow an alternative to look for progress and change lives, a sustainable
long term alternative.</p>The
education component of the project emphasizes the betterment of environment,
health, and quality of life through grassroots knowledge. The education
component is divided into two lines of action: The
first line attempts to create economic stability for families. It establishes a
business designed, organized and managed by the project participants. Decisions
are made in group dialogue, avoiding inter-group complications. In addition,
ASSADE guides them with the creation of the business and acts as an advisory
board, which is especially important during the early stages of creation. The
second line educates families in higher goals of autonomy and empowerment. It
consists of workshops whose themes are chosen through discussion and by the
members of the project (including both the participants and the ASSADE staff).
On our part, we wish to address the issues which we believe are crippling rural
life, as well as issues that arise in discussion. In particular, health issues
and the importance of hand hygiene, dental hygiene and family planning, social
and psychological issues such as self-esteem and gender violence, environmental
preservation and economic issues such as the importance of saving are topics
which are emphasized. These issues are proposed to the group in the same way
which any other member may propose a topic that interests them. Both topics
must be discussed and approved by the group before being carried out.<br/><p></p>
<p>The dynamics of the trainings
and workshops are also horizontal (they are run in a discussion, almost
Socratic seminar, format). Keeping in mind that academic knowledge cannot
replace empirical knowledge, the leaders of the discussion tread carefully with
respect and openness. The training should form a harmonious workshop that
transcends the myth of the dichotomy ""wisdom"" vs.
""Ignorance"". Because of this, we try to avoid teacher-student
structure and the vertical transfer of academic content. The more formal content

</div></div>","My name is Julio Letona, I'm the project development in charge of a Guatemalan NGO. For more than 5 years working in this project I realise that one of the most difficult things is to raise funds to make them. A volunteer recommended to me the 'crowfunding' platform, so here I am, very excited presenting our project  and hoping you can help us out to make it true. K'uxiub'al is an initiative to support the prevention and development project of Association for health and development (ASSADE), K'uxiub'al is a mayan term that means that we all put for the welfare of all. ASSADE is a guatemalan
NGO located in the highlands, specifically in San Andrés Itzapa, Chimaltenango.
A region with 33,000 inhabitants, where 90% belongs to the mayan ethnicity
‘kaqchikel’. Close to 75% of popolutation living in poverty, and near to 35% in
extreme poverty, it means when people survive with less than a dollar per day
and they don’t have access to cover the basic needs. ASSADE born with the dream
of a women who worked 25 years in the public health system of Guatemala, during
the civil war in the country that last for 36 years, in 1980; her brother, a
doctor who she admired was murdered. After that moment, she
noticed a lot of changes in the public health system, the transition to from
dictatorship to democracy makes the health system will deploring, reaching ruin.
In 2004 she decided to fund ASSADE, a non governmental and non profit
organization, dedicated to promoting health and sustainable development,
quality and social justice, especially in the maternal and child group living
in poverty and extreme poverty. Her biggest dream is to built a entire health
center to cover all people who need it, she wants to name the center after her
brother, and she hopes not to die before seeing his dream come true.

ASSADE bases its actions on
the belief that health care is a constitutive right of human beings and to
address the psycho-social needs of individuals, families and communities. We
understand development as the possibility that the different groups,
ethnicities and cultures are free agents of their own destiny to economic,
social and political level, with the ultimate aim the realization of women and
men. ASSADE began as a only primary health clinic for two years, then it was possible
to creat a very tiny pharmacy. Nowadays ASSADE has four clinics, two of them
function in regular daily bases, one clinic to different purposes, once a month
for example we have a day dedicated to the gynecological branch (pap testing,
IUD method, ultrasounds, cryotherapy) or sometimes with volunteers of other
specialties like physicology, physiotherapy, pediatrics, cardiology, among
others. The other clinic will be for dental care, we still haven’t opened for
resources but we hope in a near future it will be ready. ASSADE has a pharmacy,
a recovery room, a warehouse, dining room and an office. We still pay rent for
the facilities, because we have no resources to buy land and begin construction
of the center. ASSADE is formed by a group of six people. ASSADE covers around
900 people monthly, people only pay a donation fee for consultation and meds
according to their possibilities. 
In 2011 we started working on
prevention, that we believe is very important to cover and implement a project
in the communities. We realise that is quite necessary to reach progress and
human well being, through years we identified three prevailing conditions:
respiratory problems, gastrointestinal problems and malnutrition. We looked for
the real causes and started working on this, that’s how the prevention project
was born. To explain what the project is about, we will share you a short
story. 

We want you to meet Lesbia
Micá, she is an indigenous women of the community in San Andrés Itzapa. She has 4
childrens, a 3 boys and a girl. She lives in small land property of her mother
in law. As most of the families in the region,
the family of Lesbia have access to water one hour every two days, unfortunately
the water of the region isn’t drinkable, comes directly from the rivers with
high levels of contamination. Her childs suffer from constant diarrhea and
serious gastrointestinal infections (second cause of death in childrens under 7
years old in the region). She as an adult suffer less, but even so, at least
three times a year she contracts an intestinal infection. 


Rivers in the región as
used as a dump because the governamental service of waste disposal only covers
1% of the population, and the rest by private services, this only reach the 8%
of population. One of the main reason of the low percentage is the cost.
Lesbia’s husban is a farmer with an income of US$ 2 per day, so they used to
cover the greatest need (food), as they live far from the river they get rid of
the garbage burning it or throwing in the cesspool. First stage of the project,
considering the evidence of the water problem in the region, ASSADE donated a
water purifier to Lesbia’s family, also teach them how to use it and give it
maintenance. Lesbia atended during two month once a week to receive trainings
related to the water problem, related diseases, prevention mesuares, cycle of
water, general hygiene, and environmental conservation. 



ASSADE
works with group of women, that mean that first we stablished a group of women
with the common needs, at the beginning women join with fear, but with the
mental image of receiving a benefit, turns out that the guatemalan government
bases its projects in giving away things. As the conditions of living of the
women are precarious, they see that an alternative to cover they needs. It took
a long time to change that mind, awareness of that kind of solutions only helps
in a timely manner, but not a long term solution; or the solution isn’t based
in the real problem, only cover the impact of that.  Then the groups start working as an
alternative to introduced women to another environment beyond the rol of
mother-wife, we realize that starting within our homes and our community there
are differents problems involved, over time women notous that the group in
itself have a whole meaning, an space of expression, an space of trust, of
understanding, we think that every women at the group in differents moments
reach the feeling of belonging, that is awesome, because all their lives they
were taught that they only are to have childs and take care of their homes,
that they don’t have a voice or right to choose in the macho culture, the group
complete changes the ways to see life.
Lesbia
also uses an open fire to cook, other risk for the health of her family,
specially she and her childrens, that passed at least nine hours every day
inside the room they used to cook. Places like this are linked to respiratory
problems, also burns and burning eyes. Respiratory problems are the first cause
of death in the region, specially in kids under seven years old. As one of the
biggest problems, ASSADE helps to built a clean stoves, as a second stage of the project.

Open fire is more common way to cook in the región . At least 80% of the population use it. In first place because
firewood is a fuel very easy to get, nowadays in the region there are no enviromental
laws, so some families buy the firewood or dedicated working hours to get it. The smoke in the room is insupportable and the flames are a
constant risk for Lesbia and her childrens. She only can cook one thing at the
time. The space isn’t the ideal of hygiene. In Guatemala, 65% of deforestation due to the use for
cooking. 




As a cohesive
group, all the activities we carried out with a team work spirit. Her group mates help her throughout the process. Lesbia already received for two months training related to cook
with open fire, linked diseases, ways of heat transfer, environmental
conservation, cooking hygine, cultural significant of fire, how to confront the
change of the way she cooks that will change all her life style. The new stove is
portable, it is manufactured in the workshop so we can eliminated the old way
of cooking and built the new one without waiting of drying process, and Lesbia
can start using it until finish the construction. It uses three times less
firewood, the fire chamber optimizes the fuel, is possible to cook two things
at the same time, used the griddle to make ‘tortillas’, it has two wings to
cover the absense of tables toe at in the families, it has a chimney driving
99% of smoke out side, also child protection. And it has a harmony with the
mayan culture. 
The
extreme poverty of families prevents them from eating full diets which meet
even minimal nutritional standards. Only having access to meager amounts of the
same food every day leads directly to malnutrition and stagnant development in
children. In the region, that is base on agricultura, they grow corn and black
beans, main ingredients of the regular diet in Guatemala. Food availability is
one of the factors that influence the quantity and quality of the products
consumed by a family. Children and women need a more varied diet. The immediate
solution that we have implemented is alternative gardens and small raising hens
farms, which work as an effective tool for the family to produce and consume
low-cost, healthy food. In addition, the family is able to work together to
produce food and future food security. This type of garden or farm and crop
establishment is directly related to the needs and preferences of each family,
always working as a group. At first, ASSADE works with groups of women,
specially in training, in a wide range of training. From healt-related issues
to ‘how to work in groups?’, covering communication skills, dispute resolution,
gender violence, physcological and emotional issues, team work, a big variety
of tools only to work in a group. Food availity is part of the third stage of
the project, in other cases the group have chosen to make handicrafts and
stablish a Little bussines, home hygiene products, this will depend on the
group. The whole idea is the economical empowerment of women, transfering tools
that they can be able to apply on their daily bases to reach a complete welfare
of their family, group and community. 

Other important thing in the
idea of creating and working a group, is the construction of alternatives for
living as a women, recovery all the rights as a humans they deserve, and
empowerment themselves. We confront the fact that one of the things that stop
us from development is violence, also we teach and learn, we start as students
and then become teachers, we always are learning. So, the groups exist as an
space of expression and trust for women, to discuss around all the
topics-problem that need to confront, in differents levels, space that allows
them to recover their rights, practicing in their households and community, a
group able to do political impact, inspired on protect and promote women beyond
the alienating role, considering the environment, freedom, dignity and social
peace to change lives, an space to share suffering. ASSADE created this idea of
working with women groups, based that they can exist as a community union that
can allow an alternative to look for progress and change lives, a sustainable
long term alternative.The
education component of the project emphasizes the betterment of environment,
health, and quality of life through grassroots knowledge. The education
component is divided into two lines of action: The
first line attempts to create economic stability for families. It establishes a
business designed, organized and managed by the project participants. Decisions
are made in group dialogue, avoiding inter-group complications. In addition,
ASSADE guides them with the creation of the business and acts as an advisory
board, which is especially important during the early stages of creation. The
second line educates families in higher goals of autonomy and empowerment. It
consists of workshops whose themes are chosen through discussion and by the
members of the project (including both the participants and the ASSADE staff).
On our part, we wish to address the issues which we believe are crippling rural
life, as well as issues that arise in discussion. In particular, health issues
and the importance of hand hygiene, dental hygiene and family planning, social
and psychological issues such as self-esteem and gender violence, environmental
preservation and economic issues such as the importance of saving are topics
which are emphasized. These issues are proposed to the group in the same way
which any other member may propose a topic that interests them. Both topics
must be discussed and approved by the group before being carried out.
The dynamics of the trainings
and workshops are also horizontal (they are run in a discussion, almost
Socratic seminar, format). Keeping in mind that academic knowledge cannot
replace empirical knowledge, the leaders of the discussion tread carefully with
respect and openness. The training should form a harmonious workshop that
transcends the myth of the dichotomy ""wisdom"" vs.
""Ignorance"". Because of this, we try to avoid teacher-student
structure and the vertical transfer of academic content. The more formal content
is discovered experientially through elements of reality in which we live.The
education component also sets real life, approachable role models and goals
(for example, proposing solutions to improve their living conditions
significantly). This methodology is based on the fact that cooperative
relations within a group may in many cases meet such targets to improve living
conditions.

We encourage group of
women to take the tools that they have after time of training and lead it to
the community, like other group of women, schools, and other groups. In the
photo to the left, a training in a school of basic hygiene and how to avoid
gastrointestinal deseases. At the end, we believe that the education component
is the most important one in all the process. ASSADE doesn’t have any kind of
support (national or internation), we only carried out this project with
individual donations. 
Since December 2011 we had worked with 52 families (238 persons)
with this project, at this moment we are working with a new group of 30 women,
where Lesbia belongs and we are facing the lack of resources to support final stages to complete the project.-
Why women? In the region, women have to face too many barriers, starting with three types of discrimination; as women, as indigenous, and as poor. Women are powerful, they only need the basic tools to create their own destiny. A beautiful, human and peaceful destination.-

    What we need? Details of funding  We will need to raise US$ 16,560 to change completly the life of 30 poor families in the region.

    Risks and challenges  Maybe the biggest risks and challenges of the project are male violence, survival and mental image in the women caused by government projects, of give palliatives to try to solve serious problems, that at the end only maintains the situation as it is, we want to make serious changes, better and trutly changes.  We focus in the real causes of the problems. We confron the problems from a integral perspective, including the community and professionals. Our gratest weapon to confront risks and challenges is education. We believe in education for transformation. Our impacts in the past have confirmed that it is actually a outstanding key to the project.

</div></div>","Our Story

My name is Dr. Milton O'Brien, a chiropractor in San Francisco practicing bio-mechanics for over 30 years. ​​My mother Joyce ​ suffered a massive stroke paralyzing her completely on her right side when she ​was 89 years old.  After she came home from the hospital trying to move her from one place to another became extremely difficult.  That's when I got the idea to create TransferPants™.
TransferPants™ have handles sewn into the outside of the pants and into the liner.  TransferPants™ worked so well and are so unique that it was eligible to receive a U.S. patent.   
Why are we making TransferPants™?
There are​ over 4 million people today living in wheelchairs in the U.S. alone​ NOT​ counting those who are partially​ paralyzed​. People ​with​ brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, strokes, heart attack, birth defects, and disable​d​ vets.
We’ve been selling TransferPants™ since January 2015, and buyers responses have been overwhelmingly positive. Most buyers start by purchasing one pair of TransferPants™ and within a few weeks come back for more, Emailing us testimonials about how well TransferPants™ work, and how they have improved the lives of their loved ones and their caregivers.
We have created our new line of TransferPants™ that we have improved on over  the last 12 months. We have added 2 zippers in the front  for easy dressing, new styles, softer materials, and  more colors.

TransferPants™ Solutions:




Prevents falls and serious injuries

Inconspicuous and unobtrusive handles put less strain on the back of the caregiver

Interior liner prevents an uncomfortable “wedgie”
Security for the individual during rehabilitation, physical therapy and activities of daily living
Ideal for mobility challenged individuals with lower extremity weakness and paralysis
Skin abrasions and discomfort are less likely
Machine-washable

</div></div>","Short Summary 

Poor health is pushing 39 million Indians to poverty every year; Rural India needs 19,236 specialists at its community health centers but it has a shortfall of 12,310 doctors; About 30% of people in rural India did not opt for treatment because of financial constraints; 31 percent of the rural population in India has to travel over 30 km to get needed medical treatment; 8% of the Primary Healthcare Centers  do not have doctors or medical staff; 50 percent of obstetricians, pediatricians, and gynecologists positions are vacant.


PRADAN (www.pradan.net) is a public service organization registered under society act, headquartered in Delhi. PRADAN has been working in 42 districts in 8 states across India towards poverty alleviation in remote tribal regions of the country. It has been working since 1983 in hinterland of central India with a mission of impacting livelihood to enable rural community. By March 2015, PRADAN worked with over 380,000 families in 5,429 villages in 104 blocks spread over 42 districts across the States of Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan and West Bengal. 

A successful pilot was undertaken from June to August 2015 in 9 villages of Dholpur (www.dholpur.rajasthan.gov.in), one of the most backward and challenging region of India to provide Health Services using Mobile Technologies to the families through local cadre commonly known as Jan Sakhi. It is now planned to scale this to over 100 villages to be able to provide health services to over 30,000 families on cost sharing basis.

   What We Need The Mobile Health Scale-up Program needs USD 300,000 for every 100 villages and will cover expenses spanning Healthcare Delivery, Technology, Human Resources and Operations over a 5 year period. 
The program has been designed in a way that the end users will start contributing from the fourth year to make it self-sustainable in the long term.
    The Impact
The  program will make healthcare accessible, affordable and accurate for the sections of the society that have long been deprived of primary health services. 
Through a coordinated orchestration of Healthcare Delivery, Technology, Human Resources and Operations, the program will create a triage model utilizing front-line workers with low education levels but high enthusiasm, to alleviate the acute shortfall of trained medical professionals, particularly in difficult habitats. 
Besides primary health, the goal is also to address locally-significant issues like Silicosis, Tuberculosis, Maternal Mortality Rate, Infant Mortality Rate and Immunization.

    Other Ways You Can Help For people with bank account in India, you can also contribute in the following ways mentioning 'Jan Sakhi' in your remittance:
(a) Electronic Transfer to 'Saheli Samiti, Dholpur'; Account Number: 1942000100909995; Punjab National Bank (IFSC: PUNB0194200).
(b) Mail a Cheque or Demand Draft favoring 'Saheli Samiti, Dholpur' to Saheli, 1/363, Anand Nagar, Saipau Road, Dholpur, 328001 (Rajasthan).

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Caddieye is the first
rangefinder available, which works in conjunction with your smartphone and which
is designed for sports. The device is attached to the phone’s back cover,
after which it is ready to be used. Rangefinder includes a separate battery, so
it doesn’t consume power from phone. With Caddieye Rangefinder and applications
you can enhance the experience playing regular golf, but it can be also used

</div>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>How does it work?</h3>
<div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Caddieye Rangefinder technology is based on regular
distance meter. It utilizes a powerful laser pulse, which is aimed at the
target by using optics. Reception optics include a filter, which lets only a
particular wavelength of light to receiver. This eliminates sunlight and other
disturbances, which would otherwise affect measuring. The technique is based on
measuring the time between sending the laser pulse and receiving it from
desired target. Caddieye can be recalibrated as many times as required, so it
can be used with multiple phones.</p>

Caddieye Rangefinder is
controlled by Arm Cortex-M3 -based microcontroller. The measurement results are
sent via Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, which in turn displays the
results as camera images with an integrated application view. The device is
controlled by phone, and target selected with phone’s touch screen. The
smartphone’s camera works as binoculars for the device; this has enabled
reducing the size of the gadget to minimum. The phone camera object detection
is also utilized in measuring.<p></p>

depending on the object and its size)</li>
<li>Measuring accuracy +/- 2 meters</li>

<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p>Caddieye app works in conjunction with the rangefinder.
Smartphone requires a camera, since the rangefinder uses it for aiming.
Applications are available for Android and iOS platforms. There are two
different versions: for regular golf, and for disc golf. It is possible to
create your own player profile, which allows you to save data and examine it
afterwards. You can also add friends to your profile and compare the results.
Caddieye app also includes a scorecard as well as a possibility for real-time
performance monitoring. The golf application includes information about courses

<h3>Why Choose Caddieye Product Range?</h3>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>Caddieye is the first rangefinder for golf and disc
golf courses which utilizes laser technology as well as smartphone technology.
With the application it is possible to combine different features. Using the
scorecard alongside with the distance meter enables quick action, and you can
rest assured your playing data is stored reliably. You can use the course
information to explore a specific course and plan your round in advance – and
naturally analyse your results afterwards. We are also developing a cloud service
integrated with the application, so you can survey the statistics and compare
your results from a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Thanks to recharging with Micro-USB, the device is
always ready to be used, unlike the older models with disposable batteries. You
can recharge your device in your car en route to a golf course. Additionally,
the advanced GPS tracking allows you to view functions on the course. Our aim
was to develop an application, which is as simple and as user-friendly as
possible, and which is easy to modify according to your own preferences. You
can select the information shown on default display and enter the preliminary
information of your choosing.</p>
<p>Caddieye Product Range is a brand new way to keep
track of your game!</p>

maintain core body strength and improve posture by reminding you to keep your
stomach muscles tight.</b></h3>

<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>Core muscular strength - vital to a healthy existence</b></h3>
<p>Our core muscles are literally at the center of everything we do - from lifting a child to turning and looking over our shoulder in the car. Core muscles are what keep our back aligned, cause us to stand up straight, and keep our stomach from showing that oft-familiar 'pooch' or even a subtle sagging over the belt. But an alarming amount of people struggle to maintain a strong and toned core.     </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443983453/unlwoix4nq1rpk0neffi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p></p>
<p>The problem is that we train our abdominal muscles while working out, but fail to maintain this core muscle tension when we're not. If any pause in exercise lasts more than only a few days, we lose some of what we gained in the gym and end up feeling sluggish and showing a gut due to our lax stomach. Worse yet, if we remain out of the gym for weeks or even months due to a busy work schedule or travel, this may lead to a weakening of our core muscles - something that can cause poor posture, lower back pain and a number of other ailments later on in life. </p>

<i>Our friend Nik before the Bellyminator</i>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>A helping hand</b></h3>
<p>The Bellyminator was
designed to solve this problem by focusing on your abdominals remaining tight
throughout the day, so that you don't have to.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h2>While most abdominal machines work to rebuild
and strengthen your muscles, they often forget one
key ingredient: <i>muscle memory. </i>
</h2>
<h2>Not anymore!</h2>
<p>Bellyminator works by using the core concept of
classic conditioning. It simply reminds you
when you’ve let your tummy muscles loosen, and
eventually you will maintain the posture needed to
provide optimal conditioning. After just a few days,
you'll subconsciously stand taller and straighter,
looking leaner and more confident. Eventually, your
muscles and your mind will do the work for you. </p>
<p></p>

<i>For those of us who lack discipline and require extra encouragement - Level 2 Pad a.k.a. ""The Watchdog"".  It has sharper teeth and accelerated ""habit development"".</i>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<i><br/></i><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Because Bellyminator requires you to stand up straight and pull your abdominal
muscles in, you are naturally placing yourself in good anatomical alignment. Since
Bellyminator offers a subtle reminder each time you slouch and/or release your belly, you
are less likely to find yourself slipping back into bad posture habits.</p>
<h2>The best part is, not only are you toning your abs, but studies show that good
posture increases self-confidence and overall well-being! </h2>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To use it, simply tighten
up your stomach muscles, strap on the Bellyminator, adjust the belt so it fits
snuggly around your waist, and position the tension monitor just to the side of
your belly button. As you go about your day, a simple spring-activated
lever provides a sharp tap every time you relax your abs and let out your
stomach, thus reminding you to stand or sit up straight and tighten back up.
After only two weeks of a few hours per day, the result is a mind that has been
programed to tighten up the abs even before a tap is received and, ultimately,
a core that remains conditioned and toned in-between workouts. Whenever your
core muscles begin to lapse back into old habits, you just strap the
Bellyminator back on! </span></p>

<br/>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That said, the
Bellyminator </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">does not</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> take away the need for workouts.  As active
people we all understand that nothing is free when it comes to fitness.
 But imagine you are about to take a family vacation for a week and will
be away from your regular workout routine or maybe you’re a weekend warrior
with little time for the gym during work days. With the Bellyminator, you can
maintain your hard earned results while on that vacation or working throughout
the week without taking any steps backward. When you finally make it back to
the gym, you can start right off from where you left things.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;""><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">How is it different from a high intensity gym workout?</b><br/></p>
<p>Gym workouts that incorporate crunches and sit-ups engage your core muscles during a few sets of burst-like deep impact motions, where your abs are under very strong and intense pressure for a short amount of time. Allowing muscles to recover and repair after such workouts is important, but when your abs are allowed to relax for an excessive amount of time, you lose most of what you achieved during the workout and your next session amounts to simply recovering your past results.  Basically you embark on a “formula” of 2 steps forward one step back (provided your workouts are productive).  </p>
<p>Now, imagine taking a single 5-pound dumbbell and holding it in front of you at 90 degrees for 15-20 minutes every day between your workouts. You wouldn’t feel anything within the first 5 minutes, but after a full 20 minutes your biceps would be sore from the low intensity effort at keeping that weight up. The Bellyminator works the same way - training your mind to keep your abs tight and your back straight in a low intense mode throughout the day. It takes a minimal amount of energy to use, but when it’s worn over an extended amount of time, this keeps your core muscles fit and toned when a higher intensity workout is not possible. It’s not a substitute for more intense workouts, but rather a supplement to them.<br/></p>

<p><i>Check it out!  (same guy).</i></p>
<p>The beauty of it is the Bellyminator can be used virtually anywhere and anytime since it fits discreetly beneath your clothing. You can wear it to the office, put it on before an evening walk, or even take it to the laundromat. The world's the limit. <br/></p>

</div><div>
<p>I initially thought of the
Bellyminator while working on a different product back in 2008 - which I
affectionately named the 'Fit Kit'. The Fit Kit was a vest-like
device that could be worn by people with back problems to help them
train their upper body without lifting weights. However, when testing the vest
I noticed that abdominals were left completely out of the equation and it
did not address a crucial aspect of what often caused back pain in the first
place - weak core muscles. I quickly went to the drawing board and came up with
a draft plan for what would later be known as the Bellyminator. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443841677/cedz5zg1mp12ptwyxus7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 376.822429906542px; height: 240px;""/></p>

<p>It took two years to reach
a workable prototype. I gave copies of the prototype to friends and family, and
improved the design until finally arriving at a working model - the
Bellyminator Generation 1 (G1).</p>
</div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> It is designed
around an inbuilt mechanism inside us all called conditioned reflex, which was
well researched and described by Dr. Ivan Pavlov way back in 1904. Conditioned
reflex enables us to do things on an instinctive and subconscious level, just
like learning to keep our head up when we’re toddlers. Following the same
Pavlovian logic, using the Bellyminator I was able to teach my stomach muscles
to remain tight on their own even without thinking about it.</span></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""464"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F141289313&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F141289313&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F538245354_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" width=""580""></iframe></div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Developing conditioned reflex with the Bellyminator in 'slo-mo'.</i></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In addition to promoting better posture and a stronger core, development and subsequent testing of Bellyminator on a group of close friends revealed a number of other “side effects”, which I had never aimed for. Various friends reported improved metabolism, greater energy level, increased attention from peers and colleagues (due to a tighter stomach), and improved confidence/self-esteem. My team and I continue to observe and record these effects and we encourage our users to share their findings with us.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After these initial rounds
of testing, I produced a small batch of a couple thousand units and began
marketing them, but a marriage to my beautiful wife in 2011 brought my efforts
to a standstill. This year I've decided to pick things back up and am excited
to debut the Bellyminator G1 to all of you at Indiegogo! </span></p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Goals moving forward</b><br/></p>
<p>Since picking things back
up, I've been able to formulate a few improvements to the model.  The Generation 1 is a full time model – i.e.
it does not have the “inactive mode”. 
Sometimes, when attending an important meeting or driving, you don’t
want to be distracted by any taps or clicks. 
Generation-2 will be equipped with inactivation switch so you can put
Bellyminator into inactive mode when you want to focus your attention on
something important.  It can also be
useful, if you want to go for a light run during a walk.  Generation-2 will also have different tension
levels for discharge so you can adjust it to a required level.</p>
<p>The purpose of this
campaign is not only to efficiently get the Bellyminator into the hands of
sophisticated end users, but also to raise the necessary funds to produce and
market a next generation (G2) model. If our goal of $60,000 is met, this model
will be ready to market and sell by Spring of 2016. </p>
<p>Though one of the main
advantages of the Bellyminator G1 is its simple analog design, my ultimate goal
is to digitize the device in order to store data and expand its capabilities.
 Once this is ready, my team and I plan to get it into the hands of health
professionals and trainers, who can use it for a number of different clients.</p>
<p> Achieving our <b>stretch
goal of $100,000 </b>would allow us to go directly to G3 and make the device
digital within a year!  Digital
Bellyminator will count taps, number of hours and days of use, number of sizes
lost, store data, transmit it to your smart phone, etc.  This will enable us to offer two designs to our customers: one - analogue (Gen2), and the other one - digital (Gen3).</p>

</div></div>","Bellyminator helps
maintain core body strength and improve posture by reminding you to keep your
stomach muscles tight.


Core muscular strength - vital to a healthy existence
Our core muscles are literally at the center of everything we do - from lifting a child to turning and looking over our shoulder in the car. Core muscles are what keep our back aligned, cause us to stand up straight, and keep our stomach from showing that oft-familiar 'pooch' or even a subtle sagging over the belt. But an alarming amount of people struggle to maintain a strong and toned core.     

 
The problem is that we train our abdominal muscles while working out, but fail to maintain this core muscle tension when we're not. If any pause in exercise lasts more than only a few days, we lose some of what we gained in the gym and end up feeling sluggish and showing a gut due to our lax stomach. Worse yet, if we remain out of the gym for weeks or even months due to a busy work schedule or travel, this may lead to a weakening of our core muscles - something that can cause poor posture, lower back pain and a number of other ailments later on in life. 





Most trainers say that in order to keep our abdominal muscles strong and looking sharp, we need to regularly train them in the gym and focus on tightening them up between workouts. But who is able to do this consistently? Can we really focus our minds on keeping our abs tight throughout the day when there are so many other things vying for our attention?




Our friend Nik before the Bellyminator


A helping hand
The Bellyminator was
designed to solve this problem by focusing on your abdominals remaining tight
throughout the day, so that you don't have to.  







While most abdominal machines work to rebuild
and strengthen your muscles, they often forget one
key ingredient: muscle memory. 

Not anymore!
Bellyminator works by using the core concept of
classic conditioning. It simply reminds you
when you’ve let your tummy muscles loosen, and
eventually you will maintain the posture needed to
provide optimal conditioning. After just a few days,
you'll subconsciously stand taller and straighter,
looking leaner and more confident. Eventually, your
muscles and your mind will do the work for you. 



Discharged Bellyminator with Level 1 Pad.




For those of us who lack discipline and require extra encouragement - Level 2 Pad a.k.a. ""The Watchdog"".  It has sharper teeth and accelerated ""habit development"".






Because Bellyminator requires you to stand up straight and pull your abdominal
muscles in, you are naturally placing yourself in good anatomical alignment. Since
Bellyminator offers a subtle reminder each time you slouch and/or release your belly, you
are less likely to find yourself slipping back into bad posture habits.
The best part is, not only are you toning your abs, but studies show that good
posture increases self-confidence and overall well-being! 

To use it, simply tighten
up your stomach muscles, strap on the Bellyminator, adjust the belt so it fits
snuggly around your waist, and position the tension monitor just to the side of
your belly button. As you go about your day, a simple spring-activated
lever provides a sharp tap every time you relax your abs and let out your
stomach, thus reminding you to stand or sit up straight and tighten back up.
After only two weeks of a few hours per day, the result is a mind that has been
programed to tighten up the abs even before a tap is received and, ultimately,
a core that remains conditioned and toned in-between workouts. Whenever your
core muscles begin to lapse back into old habits, you just strap the
Bellyminator back on! 










That said, the
Bellyminator does not take away the need for workouts.  As active
people we all understand that nothing is free when it comes to fitness.
 But imagine you are about to take a family vacation for a week and will
be away from your regular workout routine or maybe you’re a weekend warrior
with little time for the gym during work days. With the Bellyminator, you can
maintain your hard earned results while on that vacation or working throughout
the week without taking any steps backward. When you finally make it back to
the gym, you can start right off from where you left things.
How is it different from a high intensity gym workout?
Gym workouts that incorporate crunches and sit-ups engage your core muscles during a few sets of burst-like deep impact motions, where your abs are under very strong and intense pressure for a short amount of time. Allowing muscles to recover and repair after such workouts is important, but when your abs are allowed to relax for an excessive amount of time, you lose most of what you achieved during the workout and your next session amounts to simply recovering your past results.  Basically you embark on a “formula” of 2 steps forward one step back (provided your workouts are productive).  
Now, imagine taking a single 5-pound dumbbell and holding it in front of you at 90 degrees for 15-20 minutes every day between your workouts. You wouldn’t feel anything within the first 5 minutes, but after a full 20 minutes your biceps would be sore from the low intensity effort at keeping that weight up. The Bellyminator works the same way - training your mind to keep your abs tight and your back straight in a low intense mode throughout the day. It takes a minimal amount of energy to use, but when it’s worn over an extended amount of time, this keeps your core muscles fit and toned when a higher intensity workout is not possible. It’s not a substitute for more intense workouts, but rather a supplement to them.

Check it out!  (same guy).
The beauty of it is the Bellyminator can be used virtually anywhere and anytime since it fits discreetly beneath your clothing. You can wear it to the office, put it on before an evening walk, or even take it to the laundromat. The world's the limit. 


You wear the Bellyminator under clothes so  your ""undercover workouts"" are discrete and unnoticeable. 


The Bellyminator's origins

I initially thought of the
Bellyminator while working on a different product back in 2008 - which I
affectionately named the 'Fit Kit'. The Fit Kit was a vest-like
device that could be worn by people with back problems to help them
train their upper body without lifting weights. However, when testing the vest
I noticed that abdominals were left completely out of the equation and it
did not address a crucial aspect of what often caused back pain in the first
place - weak core muscles. I quickly went to the drawing board and came up with
a draft plan for what would later be known as the Bellyminator. 




Early draft images of the
Bellyminator


It took two years to reach
a workable prototype. I gave copies of the prototype to friends and family, and
improved the design until finally arriving at a working model - the
Bellyminator Generation 1 (G1).

 It is designed
around an inbuilt mechanism inside us all called conditioned reflex, which was
well researched and described by Dr. Ivan Pavlov way back in 1904. Conditioned
reflex enables us to do things on an instinctive and subconscious level, just
like learning to keep our head up when we’re toddlers. Following the same
Pavlovian logic, using the Bellyminator I was able to teach my stomach muscles
to remain tight on their own even without thinking about it.
Developing conditioned reflex with the Bellyminator in 'slo-mo'.
In addition to promoting better posture and a stronger core, development and subsequent testing of Bellyminator on a group of close friends revealed a number of other “side effects”, which I had never aimed for. Various friends reported improved metabolism, greater energy level, increased attention from peers and colleagues (due to a tighter stomach), and improved confidence/self-esteem. My team and I continue to observe and record these effects and we encourage our users to share their findings with us.
After these initial rounds
of testing, I produced a small batch of a couple thousand units and began
marketing them, but a marriage to my beautiful wife in 2011 brought my efforts
to a standstill. This year I've decided to pick things back up and am excited
to debut the Bellyminator G1 to all of you at Indiegogo! 
Goals moving forward
Since picking things back
up, I've been able to formulate a few improvements to the model.  The Generation 1 is a full time model – i.e.
it does not have the “inactive mode”. 
Sometimes, when attending an important meeting or driving, you don’t
want to be distracted by any taps or clicks. 
Generation-2 will be equipped with inactivation switch so you can put
Bellyminator into inactive mode when you want to focus your attention on
something important.  It can also be
useful, if you want to go for a light run during a walk.  Generation-2 will also have different tension
levels for discharge so you can adjust it to a required level.
The purpose of this
campaign is not only to efficiently get the Bellyminator into the hands of
sophisticated end users, but also to raise the necessary funds to produce and
market a next generation (G2) model. If our goal of $60,000 is met, this model
will be ready to market and sell by Spring of 2016. 
Though one of the main
advantages of the Bellyminator G1 is its simple analog design, my ultimate goal
is to digitize the device in order to store data and expand its capabilities.
 Once this is ready, my team and I plan to get it into the hands of health
professionals and trainers, who can use it for a number of different clients.
 Achieving our stretch
goal of $100,000 would allow us to go directly to G3 and make the device
digital within a year!  Digital
Bellyminator will count taps, number of hours and days of use, number of sizes
lost, store data, transmit it to your smart phone, etc.  This will enable us to offer two designs to our customers: one - analogue (Gen2), and the other one - digital (Gen3).

The United States alone could use at least 4 million new farmers to make this healthier lifestyle a reality!       Please take a look at what all our campaign dollars will be going  towards, and help us reach our goal of the $50,000. Thank you!

WB Eric, Dorene, Angelica and Derrick RovegnoIf you would like more information, please feel free to contact us personally at: zendairygoats@gmail.com or give us a call at (719) 251-0588You can also follows us on: Facebook at: Zen Dairy GoatsBy following us you can see our specials, products, baby kids (goats), and our progress as we move forward on this journey..P.S. We have an amazing game which gives you the opportunity to win some cash, by simply referring contributors to our campaign.
Here are the rules. Signup for IndieGoGo, share our campaign via Facebook, twitter, Instagram, Google, whatever platforms of social media you use, and that's it. At the end of the campaign, the winner will be selected by the amount their referrals contributed. We will track it through our campaign, give updates weekly on the leader, and will announce the winner at the end of the campaign.
OK, so the prize.. If we reach at least half of our goal, which is $25,000, I will give $500 to the winner. If we reach $12,500 the prize will be $250. Is that enough of an incentive? No, I didn't think so either. If we reach or exceed our goal of $50,000, we will give the winner $1,000, that's right $1,000 to the one who has the highest amount given by their referrals, and if we manage to double our goal, well how does a grand prize of $5,000 sound??
Better get to sharing, and encouraging contributions!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Did you ever wish you could keep your nails healthy, or improve the look of your nails by doing nothing more than pressing a button?</h3>
<div>So did we, and IllumiNail was the result....</div>
<h3>A Little Background</h3>
<ul>
<li>Onychomycosis is a progressive fungal infection that affects the nails.  Toenails are affected more often than fingernails because the fungus that causes this disease thrive in a dark, warm, moist environment that is most often found in our shoes. This condition is the most common cause of discoloration, thickness, and deformities.  An infected nail can initially appear yellow, white, or green in some areas.  If left untreated, the entire nail may eventually become discolored, thick, and crumbly.</li>
<li>Current treatments include: applying mildly effective topical solutions, taking oral medications that may be toxic to the body, or undergoing costly laser treatments  at your doctor's office.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Our Product</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The IllumiNail device is a self contained, rechargeable ""clip"" that emits a blue light aimed specifically at your toes.  Simply apply the device to the toe you want to treat, push the button on the device and let it do the  rest.  It runs through a treatment cycle, then shuts off automatically.  Put device on the next toe and repeat until all affected toes are treated.  It's that easy! </li>
<li>There is no pain, no damaging UV radiation, nothing more to buy.  </li>
<li>Use it daily to prevent thickening of healthy nails, treat affected nails and prevent recurrence.</li>
<li>Our product can be used alone, or in conjunction with your doctor's treatment to achieve the best outcome.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our initial study successfully controlled a fungal cultures growth, taken from infected nail clippings.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are looking forward to patient studies on a larger scale, so share the project!</span></li>

</div>
<h3><b>Clinical Studies</b></h3>
<div><ul>
<li>A study published in the <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lsm.20724/abstract"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lasers in Surgery and Medicine December 2008L 40(10); 734-737 </a>discovered that 405 nanometres (nm) blue light was an effective treatment for microbial infections.  The follow up study conducted in 2009 demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) light is not necessary to successfully kill the pathogens. </li>
<li>Blue light therapy was actually FDA approved over a decade ago for the treatment of severe acne. Many of the blue light treatments for acne use the same wavelengths needed to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA, which means the technology is already tested as safe and effective against micro-organisms. </li>

So did we, and IllumiNail was the result....
A Little Background

Onychomycosis is a progressive fungal infection that affects the nails.  Toenails are affected more often than fingernails because the fungus that causes this disease thrive in a dark, warm, moist environment that is most often found in our shoes. This condition is the most common cause of discoloration, thickness, and deformities.  An infected nail can initially appear yellow, white, or green in some areas.  If left untreated, the entire nail may eventually become discolored, thick, and crumbly.
Current treatments include: applying mildly effective topical solutions, taking oral medications that may be toxic to the body, or undergoing costly laser treatments  at your doctor's office.

Our Product

The IllumiNail device is a self contained, rechargeable ""clip"" that emits a blue light aimed specifically at your toes.  Simply apply the device to the toe you want to treat, push the button on the device and let it do the  rest.  It runs through a treatment cycle, then shuts off automatically.  Put device on the next toe and repeat until all affected toes are treated.  It's that easy! 
There is no pain, no damaging UV radiation, nothing more to buy.  
Use it daily to prevent thickening of healthy nails, treat affected nails and prevent recurrence.
Our product can be used alone, or in conjunction with your doctor's treatment to achieve the best outcome.
Our initial study successfully controlled a fungal cultures growth, taken from infected nail clippings.  
We are looking forward to patient studies on a larger scale, so share the project!



**Combined therapy of laser and IllumiNail

Clinical Studies

A study published in the Lasers in Surgery and Medicine December 2008L 40(10); 734-737 discovered that 405 nanometres (nm) blue light was an effective treatment for microbial infections.  The follow up study conducted in 2009 demonstrated that ultraviolet (UV) light is not necessary to successfully kill the pathogens. 
Blue light therapy was actually FDA approved over a decade ago for the treatment of severe acne. Many of the blue light treatments for acne use the same wavelengths needed to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA, which means the technology is already tested as safe and effective against micro-organisms.

<div>My name is Vlad, and this year I am involved with a great volunteer student-run organization called Queen's Health Outreach (QHO). QHO aims to promote health through peer-based education locally in Kingston, nationally in Northern Canada, and even internationally, with initiatives in Kenya, Guyana, and Belize. This means that students from Queen's University go teach about relevant health topics to children in elementary schools, teens in high schools, and adults in the community worldwide in a non-threatening and open environment! Topics range from sexual and mental health, to nutrition, to bullying and healthy relationships. Our organization works with like-minded partner organizations to tailor lesson plans depending on a community's needs. Did I mention that we are a United Way registered charity? Please visit <a href=""http://www.qho.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.qho.ca</a> for more information!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I am a Peer Educator for the Belize initiative, and in May I will be travelling there for 6 weeks with a group of Peer Educators from diverse faculties at Queen's to teach children ranging from 9 to 13 years of age. However, this wouldn't be possible without fundraising and help from wonderful people like YOU! Peer educators need to raise funds to make their initiatives possible, so this is where you come in.

<p>In tandem with this yearning for growth and change among the people, downtown Burlington is itself undergoing a Main Street revitalization.

<p>My name is Karin Elizabeth. I am a healer, and I am a teacher. I provide reiki healing sessions and reiki training classes in North Carolina. I help people to take the power of healing into their own hands. I also teach and practice meditation and whole foods nutrition, and I help people make realistic changes in their daily lives so they can live with more vitality and fulfillment. This has been a way of life for me for over twenty years. I've lived and offered my services and classes in this community for over four years. My clients and students come from Raleigh, Cary, Durham, Chapel Hill, Saxapahaw, Graham, Burlington, and Elon.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>“Team Work Makes The Dream Work”</p>
<p>In 2015 l became involved with USTA’s Diversity and Inclusion program to help grow tennis in communities. I volunteered to organize tennis programs and teach basic fundamentals to kids age 10 and under. I discovered many neighborhoods do not have tennis courts outside. The lack of facilities created a monumental problem to my objective. I studied the problem and later I created the mobile tennis screen. People can now engage anytime and place with the mobile screen.<br/>Over the past 2 years I have conducted more than 60 demonstrations in 4 Midwest States where people liked the product. Also, EZ PT has been recognized to be useful in Physical Therapy Programs. We need your support. Team work will make the dream work.  Many people had the opportunity to experience EZ Pop Tennis - who wouldn’t have, I feel ready to move forward with production. All funding received will be used for business development, product development and manufacturing, further marketing and product storage. <br/><br/>“Team work will make the Dream Work”  I am networking everyday to inspire people to join me on social media.  Ask a friend to support us.

I studied the problem and later I created the mobile tennis screen. People can now engage anytime and place with the mobile screen.Over the past 2 years I have conducted more than 60 demonstrations in 4 Midwest States where people liked the product. Also, EZ PT has been recognized to be useful in Physical Therapy Programs. We need your support. Team work will make the dream work.  Many people had the opportunity to experience EZ Pop Tennis - who wouldn’t have, I feel ready to move forward with production. All funding received will be used for business development, product development and manufacturing, further marketing and product storage. “Team work will make the Dream Work”  I am networking everyday to inspire people to join me on social media.  Ask a friend to support us. Help Fund “Making Tennis Easy And Available”- Remember the Williams Sisters who became Champions.  Anything is possible given the opportunity.

<h3>The science of stem cells</h3>
<p>Stemulation is based on the science of stem cells.  Numerous medical and scientific published studies are at the core of our formulation protocol.</p>
<p>We are born with an abundance of stem cells that support our growth to maturity.  A demonstration of this is how quickly an infant grows, but as we mature to adulthood, we have fewer and fewer stem cells to restore and repair traumas of the body.</p>
<p>Stemulation solves this issue by introducing growth factors that support and encourage the missing stem cells that produce these growth factors by reintroducing bio-identical growth factors topically.  </p>

Ideal for these skin types: normal, oily, and combination skin, acne-prone skin, mature skin
How to use: Apply 1-2 pumps of Stemulation Serum to clean face and neck to improve the appearance of skin texture and tone. For maximum benefits use twice daily
 


 
What, why and when
Stemulation Skin Care uses distinct proven methods to improve the overall condition of the skin.

The treatment of the skin tissue with growth factors, antioxidants, botanicals, and peptides that nurture and stimulate a healthy response for our skin to promote the production of collagen and elastin.  Critical to the ability to retain hydration and fight off fine lines and wrinkles.
Stemulation utilizes bio-identical stem cell growth factors - Our stem cell growth factors are produced in a pharmaceutical laboratory.  They are synthetic, not human or animal-derived.

 

 
Glow from within
The real test of skincare is the ability to go sans makeup and let the luster of your natural beauty shine through. Want better-looking skin? Stemulation Skin Care helps improve the appearance of a wide array of skin issues like acne, rosacea, dry skin, fine lines, and more.
 

Why we need your help
We were in the process of updating our packaging prior to the pandemic, it is an expensive process and with the closures, we nearly didn’t make it.  But thankfully the current pandemic has reminded us of the importance of sticking together in the world as it has changed the lives of all people and small businesses.
To maneuver through this challenge we had to shift our focus from selling almost exclusively to professionals to selling our products directly to you. 
Our goals for the future
Stemulation Skin Care is committed to creating exceptional and ethically-produced skincare products. As we move along our journey towards sustainability, we’ll keep you updated through our social channels and our website. And of course, we’re here to answer any questions you may have.
How we'll use the funds:

Complete our packaging initiative. 
Focus on ethical, organic, sustainable ingredients
Reduced production costs
Continued creation of exceptional effective skincare products

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jason Venckus and I am the founder of Momentum Fitness and Health and Momentum Power Foods which produces Regain.  Momentum Fitness and Health was created after my own health struggles and after becoming a personal trainer and health coach. In my late 20’s my own health was at risk. I drank, smoked and ate fast food almost daily. By 28 I was already taking 3 daily pills. I decided I was not going to go down that path. I started exercising and changing my nutrition. Processed foods and fast food were almost completely eliminated from my diet. I felt so good that I wanted to run 5k races and that blossomed into marathons and half-iron distance races. I eventually became a Personal Trainer, Health Coach and Fitness Nutrition Specialist.</p>
<p>I needed a natural recovery drink to compliment my new lifestyle. After reading up on coconut water and tart cherry juice I decided to mix the two together in my shaker cup for post race recovery. Someone said to me, “I would buy this!""</p>

<p>That was all I needed to hear, and I began to find the right recipe. I needed to make sure each ingredient was free of additives and contained a complete electrolyte profile. In our video, you will see testimonials from athletes of all ages. See below how we hope to have an impact on the environment as well. Momentum Fitness Companies looks to create a lasting legacy of health for people and the planet.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Simply put, we need about $15,000 for our first run. We have many people asking for this product and where they can get it. With 1/3-1/2 the sugar of major brands, no chemical preservatives, sweeteners or colors and no added sugar from cane sugar or concentrates many want this for themselves and especially for their kids. We already have $2500+ so we are asking for $12,500. This will help us to get a professional label designed, ingredients and packaging ordered and cover our insurance costs so that we can partner with a contract bottler. We will also need to be non-gmo and/or organic certified. We are already incorporated and trademarked. </p>
<p>Our product is geared mostly towards the athlete, though it does have benefits for the weekend warrior, concert goers, those suffering from hangover and those concerned about their general health. Our perks will reflect that. We want to give you functional things for your daily life, not clutter your home with more stuff you won't use. Of course we'll have stickers, shirts (nice shirts, not bulky cotton) and headbands but also bottle cozies (since we bottle in glass), custom coolers, drawstring bags and a party Ice Tub. There will be special perks for gym owners that will allow them to preorder sellable product at a 25% off discount.</p>
<p>We have already done so much leg work to build up clientele. We have been doing small scale production for our own studio and some other gyms. We have been in talks with semi-professional teams as well. So, if we do not meet our fundraising goal we will pay you your perks and scale up as much as we can and continue to build. This is not something we are giving up on! Read more about the impact we plan on having! </p>

<h3>Our Mission To Be a Green Company</h3>
<p>We also genuinely care about the environment and sustainability and this is evident in all phases of the production of our product. We plan to bottle in the most sustainable way. We will accomplish this by bottling in glass as it is infinitely recyclable and even easier to reuse. Studies show that only 28% of glass is recycled globally. The main reason is that glass is not put in the recycle bins properly in order to be recycled. We, as a company, will use social media to promote proper recycling procedures for our by-products. In addition we have instituted a bottle return policy. Those returning bottles will receive discounts on future purchases for each bottle returned. </p>
<p>We will source our coconuts from farms that support sustainable farming practices and initiatives. Currently 4.1 billion coconuts are harvested each year. Many of the husks end up in the ocean but there are companies finding many uses for them including: shipping pallets, cat litter, mulch, organic pest repellent (slugs), bedding/litter for reptiles, mushroom growth, mosquito repellent and FUEL! In time we hope to open solar/wind powered bottling plants and use fuel efficient/alternative fuel vehicles. </p>
<p>Regain is not just good for you, it is good for the planet. Our goal is to also create a charity that raises money for the planet, people and animals. 5% of Momentum Power Foods proceeds and 1% from Momentum Fitness and Health will go to this charity. Momentum Fitness Companies looks to create a lasting legacy of health for people and the planet.</p>
<p>Both businesses have green missions and look to use our status to improve the planet. Current successful campaigns include monthly plogging groups (picking up litter while jogging), Styrofoam collection for recycling and gardener's exchanges where local gardeners grow produce, swap with each other and donate 10-50% to local families in need. Because of these programs, the founder of Momentum Fitness Companies, will be given an award this year as a top 30 Entrepreneur Under 40 by the West Suburban Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Chicago). </p>

<p>Getting seen is always the hardest part of any business. Many people fear getting rejected when they ask to show a new product. This has not been an issue for us.

Our team is very motivated, willing to do the legwork and get out in the public!

<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Joshelle Jackson and I am the Founder and Creator of Retro Elle. Back in 2013, I became a mother to a beautiful baby girl. Til this day, I continue to feel my daughter is the greatest gift God has given me. Unfortunately, during that time, I had also developed postpartum depression. I was still getting use to living in Atlanta, GA for the first time and miles away from all my family and loved ones who were in Connecticut. I often questioned, how could such a joyful gift cause me to feel so low? So, I decided to take back my power and started paying more attention to my selfcare and overall wellness. I attended therapy and would often use my daughter's naps and bedtime as my personal selfcare routine. I called it #mommymetime. If I had at least 15-20 minutes of alone time, I was good. I started creating my own natural beauty products (body butters, bath soaks, candles, etc.) that I would use during bath time, yoga and meditation. I started noticing a dramatic shift in my mood and was on the road to recovery!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY I CREATED RETRO ELLE</h2>
</div><div>
<p>The word Retro means: Imitative of a style, fashion, design or things from the recent past. Denoting action that is directed backward. The word Elle means: she, her (in French).  </p>
<p>I created Retro Elle because I feel that society paints this image that once you become a mom, you are supposed to be mute and who you were once before should retreat into the universe somewhere. You are now a mom and should sacrifice everything you have and all that you are for your children. But, before you were a mom, mama, mommy, mother, you were Elle! You had an identity. You had goals. You had ambition. You had a purpose. And, it's time you get to HER!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
<p>Our mission is to reminder others that selfcare IS NOT SELFISH especially as a mother! If we don't take time to care for our mental, physical and emotional wellness, how can we be great mothers for our children, family or loved ones?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>RETRO ELLE PRODUCTS &amp; COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>Here at Retro Elle, we will be selling natural beauty products such as: whipped body butters, soaps, baths soaks, bath bombs, candles, etc. As a busy mom, we want to accommodate you in experiencing a meaningful selfcare routine and #mommymetime right in the comfort of your home.</p>
<p>In the near future, we would also like to start creating #MOMMYMETIME community workshops here in Atlanta, GA. We would like to host an event once a month or once every other month for mothers in the local area to get together to social and participate in activities such as: yoga, educational empowerment classes, dance, aerobics, budgeting, etc. with other mothers. We want mothers to look forward to enjoying some much needed time for themselves while having fun!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h2>

</div></div>","ABOUT ME
Hi! My name is Joshelle Jackson and I am the Founder and Creator of Retro Elle. Back in 2013, I became a mother to a beautiful baby girl. Til this day, I continue to feel my daughter is the greatest gift God has given me. Unfortunately, during that time, I had also developed postpartum depression. I was still getting use to living in Atlanta, GA for the first time and miles away from all my family and loved ones who were in Connecticut. I often questioned, how could such a joyful gift cause me to feel so low? So, I decided to take back my power and started paying more attention to my selfcare and overall wellness. I attended therapy and would often use my daughter's naps and bedtime as my personal selfcare routine. I called it #mommymetime. If I had at least 15-20 minutes of alone time, I was good. I started creating my own natural beauty products (body butters, bath soaks, candles, etc.) that I would use during bath time, yoga and meditation. I started noticing a dramatic shift in my mood and was on the road to recovery!
 
WHY I CREATED RETRO ELLE

The word Retro means: Imitative of a style, fashion, design or things from the recent past. Denoting action that is directed backward. The word Elle means: she, her (in French).  
I created Retro Elle because I feel that society paints this image that once you become a mom, you are supposed to be mute and who you were once before should retreat into the universe somewhere. You are now a mom and should sacrifice everything you have and all that you are for your children. But, before you were a mom, mama, mommy, mother, you were Elle! You had an identity. You had goals. You had ambition. You had a purpose. And, it's time you get to HER!
 

OUR MISSION
Our mission is to reminder others that selfcare IS NOT SELFISH especially as a mother! If we don't take time to care for our mental, physical and emotional wellness, how can we be great mothers for our children, family or loved ones?
 

RETRO ELLE PRODUCTS & COMMUNITY
Here at Retro Elle, we will be selling natural beauty products such as: whipped body butters, soaps, baths soaks, bath bombs, candles, etc. As a busy mom, we want to accommodate you in experiencing a meaningful selfcare routine and #mommymetime right in the comfort of your home.
In the near future, we would also like to start creating #MOMMYMETIME community workshops here in Atlanta, GA. We would like to host an event once a month or once every other month for mothers in the local area to get together to social and participate in activities such as: yoga, educational empowerment classes, dance, aerobics, budgeting, etc. with other mothers. We want mothers to look forward to enjoying some much needed time for themselves while having fun!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Many entrepreneurs are trooping to Ghana to open up businesses because it is one best and safest places in Africa to invest. <br/>I think some unexplored areas are the fields of medical research and supercomputing. Ghana is one of the leading countries in terms of scientific innovation. For instance, there is a drone delivery system for saving lives. And recently, Bill Gates praised the country's immunization system for gains over diseases like polio.<br/>There are some modern research facilities in the country. But there are a few to no facilities dedicated to computational biology/chemistry to test theoretical ideas. <br/>I want to undertake a project that will contribute to growth; in drug development, practical education, and scientific findings.<br/>In this project, I want to build a state of the art computational biology/chemistry facility accompanied by capable computer systems. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need up to $2,000,000.00. This money will go towards building a state of the art computational biology/chemistry facility through a  collaboration between Ghanaian industry players, institutions, and other international prestigious computational science labs. Also, part of the money will go into the development of computer clusters (or supercomputer) made up of 300 or more inter-linked powerful computer workstations and servers. The computer system will be designed and built through collaborations with the appropriate institutional departments and technical teams. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The coronavirus disease is a pandemic that has caused many problems around the world. I think in the future there may be similar deadly outbreaks like this around the world. The world has become a small community due to internet communication, so we are capable of sharing information. Hence, the advancement of medical research capabilities in any country makes the world a safer place. Ghana has many untapped potentials in terms of scientific development. And there are many productive ideas (or projects) that have died because of limited resources. The facility and computer system I am proposing will add up to the resources needed to advance efficient medical research and host computational intensive projects across Ghana and Africa. I believe that this will encourage several scientific and technological undertakings and promote competition. We will use the facility to train scientists and work with pharmaceutical firms on drug development.  Also, we will dedicate the facility for studying plant or herbal medications to develop safer drugs and to reproduce ancient plant-derived medicinal formulas. Herbal (or plant-based) drugs are the go-to medications for most people in Ghana and Africa; for treatments and boosting immunity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Scientific findings and breakthroughs take time and dedication. It is also expensive as it involves a lot of resources.<br/>I have collaborated with groups of scientists to develop novel drug molecules. My contribution to a project on protein-DNA interactions got me a second author on a publication. I have designed techniques for studying protein-surface interactions on a supercomputer.  A better understanding of protein-surface interactions is key to developing better artificial transplants. At the moment, I am contributing to the fight against COVID-19 by studying how COVID-19 interacts with various surfaces.<br/>I have mentored hundreds of high school students. Also, I have helped people build computer workstations for their projects. <br/>I have worked with diverse scientists (or labs) in material engineering, applied mathematics, and computational structural biology departments in Universities in America. With proper funding, my experience, and the necessary advice, I believe we can make this dream come true.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please get the word out and make some noise about our course.<br/>And use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<h3>About Preactly</h3>
<p>We are a Swedish team of four dedicated people focused to stop the increased mental health issues at workplaces. It all starts with self-awareness of as many people as possible about what is affecting us. Our tool and model contribute to that and to how you as an individual may take your self-control.</p>
<p>We studied a massive amount of research on what factors affect us as individuals. This was the beginning of our development of Preactly Digital Health Management Tool. We did it together with experts in different areas behavioral science and public health science, because it is a complex interplay of factors involving work-life, life outside work and lifestyle, that all affects our mental well-being.</p>
<p>Different countries report different numbers, but in general 10-20 % of all adults have some kind of mental health disorder. If we combine stress related headache or anxious the numbers are even higher. It is no longer possible to think that this cannot be you or I.</p>
<p>Preactly is a tool for knowledge, insights, reflection and self-empowerment for your own well-being. Based on questions about your own experience, it lets you follow your own changes over time. This is one of the most imortant things to be aware of and let you act in time and before it is too late.</p>
<p>From start we developed Preactly for workplaces and we launched it on the labour market in Sweden. However, a small user survey showed that over <strong>80 % of our users liked to use our tool at work</strong> and many <strong>would like to use our tool for their own sake</strong>, if it would be available.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""It feels much needed! The tests have been very good, incredibly easy to get started and a nice yet simple layout. The instruction and language as very supportive. I never had to read twice or think about it, but could instinctively answer.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Interesting and educational. Feedback that suited me.""</i></p>
<p>Therefore, we realised with some adjustments we could also make a version of Preactly available as an individual tool for employees and entrepreneurs. This way we can make it available for a lot more people and make a bigger impact. Now we need your help to do so!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your support to make the development and changes required to launch Preactly as a tool not only to organisations, but also to individual employees and entrepreneurs. With a funding of 9 500 EURO/9 850 USD (100 000 SEK) we can in three months develop and test the new versions.</p>
<p>In return you will of course get to use Preactly. We offer you a full year license. The options you may choose between are:</p>
<ul>
<li>For Employee or Entrepreneur</li>
<li>Swedish or English</li>
<li>Use every month or every other month</li>
</ul>
<p>Preactly is made to be intuitive and easy to use. And you will get automatically reminded so that you actually put off time. You don't even need to use it that often. Give yourself half an hour once in a while for reflection on how things in your life affects you.</p>

<div><div><p>Hexa is the first product designed by Koolmask, a Seattle-based tech start-up founded by Edward and his son Luke.      </p></div></div>
<p>When living in Asia, Luke suffered from severe allergies and asthma caused by air pollution.  Like most kids, he loves to play outside, but had to wear a face mask for all outdoor activities.  However, Luke could barely keep the mask on for 10 minutes due to the discomfort caused by the excessive heat, moisture, and restricted breathing.  Feeling frustrated and restricted, Luke wanted to have a mask that felt cool, looked cool, and would also protect him from air pollution.</p>
<p>They looked hard, but couldn’t find an adequate mask on the market, so they decided to develop their own.  After two years of hard work and help from family and friends, Hexa has risen from an idea to a product, with multiple pending international patents.</p>
<p>Luke and Edward hope Hexa will help everyone suffering from the effects of air pollution enjoy normal, active lives.</p>

<p>We need your help to bring Hexa to life, spread the word, and grow the community of early adopters.  We want to engage amazing backers here and get your input to make our product even better, so that more people can enjoy healthy and active lives with our products!    </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>As the first of its kind, Hexa has many unique benefits and challenges in terms of design, engineering, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>We have done and will do our best to minimize the risk for our backers. We have gone through more than one dozen design iterations and completed four generations of prototypes. In addition, we have selected key suppliers for our major components, as well as tooling suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our mobile app has gone through 15 test versions and is on track to be released on time.</p>
<p>Our team is experienced in design, manufacturing, and supply chain management and we are confident that we can meet our timelines. However, unexpected delays can occur due to manufacturing issues, logistics, and other issues. We will do our best to be as transparent as possible and keep you informed, and work hard to resolve any hurdles as they may arise.</p>
<h2><strong>Tooling Completion &amp; Start of Production  </strong></h2>
<p>As March 2020, despite of the virus situation globally, we completed all production tooling and successfully produced first article of the mask.  We are in the process to start mass production and aim for shipping in Summer 2020.</p>
<p>Please see following pictures of our tooling and video demo of our first production mask.</p>

Hexa provides you with peace of mind whenever and wherever you need it.Air pollution, particularly in urban areas, is a growing, global epidemic. With 80% of people living in urban areas, where they are exposed to air pollution that exceeds safe limits, it was clear to us that a safe, personal solution was needed. That is why we created Hexa.        We had regular people try Hexa and compare it to other air filtration face masks on the market.  Here's what they had to say:

 With our app, Hexa becomes more than just a personal clean air supply.  It monitors and tracks the air quality around you and alerts you.        Hexa’s smart control unit functions as both an air quality sensor and fan control.  You can adjust your mask’s airflow as well as monitor the air around you.  The smart control unit can be used independently, without connecting to the mask or battery.      Hexa’s smart control unit tracks both PM10 and PM2.5 particles and delivers data in real time to your smart phone.       Using U.S. EPA Air Quality Index (AQI) standards, our app monitors the density of airborne particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter of air.  This information is then reported using AQI color codes.      Watch Hexa's smart control unit work as an air quality sensor:

Hexa’s air quality app delivers real-time air pollution data to your smart phone and allows you to:      
Set your personal alert levelsTrack and map air pollution data      Share that data with family, friends and the Hexa community to help form a global air quality monitoring network.      Unlike air quality data provided by governmental or environmental bodies, our sensor detects the level of pollutants in a user’s immediate vicinity, providing specific, up-to-the-minute information.  Users then have the option to share the data with Hexa's global air quality network, or send directly to their friends and family.  The result?  An air quality network that provides location-specific data mapped out to share with loved ones, the Hexa community, and the general public. Hexa’s custom-made twin turbo fans can supply up to 150 liters of clean air per minute.  Whether you’re walking, jogging, cycling, or running, in the city, country, or on a crowded subway, Hexa’s clean air system provides protection and enhanced access to clean air.      Our custom engineered fans create positive air pressure inside the mask, making breathing easy and safe.Hexa’s patent-pending exhale air valve is the secret behind the mask’s cool, dry interior - a feature that really sets it apart.  This high-efficiency exhale valve allows for the quick release of heat, moisture, and CO2, preventing excess build-up and providing lasting comfort.      Hexa's open honeycomb structure provides extra airflow and helps with heat dissipation, a major problem in other masks.              Hexa offers two ways to control your clean air supply.  A standard control unit, and a smart control unit with a built-in air quality sensor.      Both control units can be used to adjust clean airflow continuously from 50 to 150 liters per minute and are easy and intuitive to use.      Standard control unit (left) and smart control unit (right)        Hexa is fueled by a 5200 mAh mobile power bank with ultra-low resistance cables that can operate the mask up to eight hours, depending on fan speed.  Using a mobile power bank increases safety while keeping weight to a minimum.      The mobile power bank works with either of Hexa's control units.                           Hexa’s design philosophy is to achieve superior protection with superior functionality.  We set out to design a personal clean air supply mask that would exceed your expectations in terms of performance, comfort, mobility, and style.       Hexa's modular clamping design makes it easy to open, change a filter, and close, while still protecting the fans and filter.      Hexa’s honeycomb design increases the available airflow, while achieving structural integrity and light weight.      Hexa's fan exhaust nozzles are directed away from the wearer's face to increase comfort and air circulation.          Hexa's silicone face seal is designed to fit various facial characteristics and sizes, while still providing comfort and minimizing leaks.      We designed Hexa to work with an external power bank to increase your flexibility and safety, while reducing the weight of mask.      Choose from one of five color options, and show off your personality and style.      Follow the evolution of the mask design, from first hand-made prototype to our most recent 3D printed model.       We progressed through dozens of major design reiterations, prototypes, tests, and validations to achieve our goal of making the world's best personal clean air supply mask.                            Custom-made fans achieve high static pressure and flow velocity with low noise level and thermal footprint.       Our fans have undergone almost as many revisions as the rest of the mask during their development.      At maximum airflow, Hexa's fans operate below skin temperature, which keeps the mask, and your face, cool.             Despite its high level of efficiency, Hexa is a quiet solution.  At full speed, Hexa’s noise level is equivalent to normal conversation or the background noise of a restaurant, which is around 60 decibels.      During laboratory testing, Hexa's filter achieved up to 97% total filtration efficiency for airborne particulate matter:        Hexa is a versatile solution designed for consumers older than 12 years of age.

 






 

 






 


 


 


 

Hexa is the first product designed by Koolmask, a Seattle-based tech start-up founded by Edward and his son Luke.      
When living in Asia, Luke suffered from severe allergies and asthma caused by air pollution.  Like most kids, he loves to play outside, but had to wear a face mask for all outdoor activities.  However, Luke could barely keep the mask on for 10 minutes due to the discomfort caused by the excessive heat, moisture, and restricted breathing.  Feeling frustrated and restricted, Luke wanted to have a mask that felt cool, looked cool, and would also protect him from air pollution.
They looked hard, but couldn’t find an adequate mask on the market, so they decided to develop their own.  After two years of hard work and help from family and friends, Hexa has risen from an idea to a product, with multiple pending international patents.
Luke and Edward hope Hexa will help everyone suffering from the effects of air pollution enjoy normal, active lives.

In this clip, you can see just how quickly and effectively Hexa filters the smoky air in our office from the left chamber and delivers the clean air to the right chamber.
 


 


We need your help to bring Hexa to life, spread the word, and grow the community of early adopters.  We want to engage amazing backers here and get your input to make our product even better, so that more people can enjoy healthy and active lives with our products!    
Risks and challenges
As the first of its kind, Hexa has many unique benefits and challenges in terms of design, engineering, and manufacturing.
We have done and will do our best to minimize the risk for our backers. We have gone through more than one dozen design iterations and completed four generations of prototypes. In addition, we have selected key suppliers for our major components, as well as tooling suppliers and contract manufacturers. Our mobile app has gone through 15 test versions and is on track to be released on time.
Our team is experienced in design, manufacturing, and supply chain management and we are confident that we can meet our timelines. However, unexpected delays can occur due to manufacturing issues, logistics, and other issues. We will do our best to be as transparent as possible and keep you informed, and work hard to resolve any hurdles as they may arise.
Tooling Completion & Start of Production  
As March 2020, despite of the virus situation globally, we completed all production tooling and successfully produced first article of the mask.  We are in the process to start mass production and aim for shipping in Summer 2020.

<li>""Use of Colloids in
     Health and Disease."" Colloidal silver has proven particularly
     effective in cases of intestinal troubles. Dr. Henry Crooks found that
     ""silver in the colloidal state is highly germicidal, quite harmless
     to humans and absolutely non-toxic. Rather than in a chemical compound,
     the silver in the colloidal state may be applied in a much more
     concentrated form, with correspondingly better results. All virus, fungus,
     bacterium, streptococcus, staphylococcus, and other pathogenic organisms
     are killed in three or four minutes upon contact. There are no side
     effects whatsoever from the highest concentrations."" </li>
<li>Dr. Robert Becker, "" <i>The
     Body Electric</i>,"" recognized a correlation between low silver
     levels and sickness. He said the silver deficiency was responsible for the
     improper functioning of the immune system. Dr. Becker's experiments
     conclude that silver works on the full spectrum of pathogens without any
     side effects or damage to any part of the body. He also states that the silver
     was doing something more than killing disease organisms. It was also
     causing major growth stimulation of injured tissues. Burn patients and
     elderly patients noticed more rapid healing. He discovered that all cancer
     cells change back to normal cells. All strains of pathogens resistant to
     other antibiotics are killed by colloidal silver. Yet at that time he
     couldn't find a silver supplement on the market. </li>
<li>""Silver, Our Mightiest
     Germ Fighter,"" <i>ScienceDigest</i>, March 1978. As an antibiotic,
     colloidal silver kills over 650 disease causing organisms, and resistant
     strains fail to develop. Silver is the best all-around germ fighter we
     have and is absolutely non-toxic! Doctors report that, taken internally,
     it works against syphilis, cholera, malaria, diabetes and severe burns.
     Richard L. Davies, executive director of the Silver Institute which
     monitors silver technology in 37 countries, reports: ""In four years
     we've described 87 important new medical uses for silver."" </li>
<li>Dr. Bjorn Nordstrom, of the
     Karolinska Institute, Sweden,
     has used silver in his cancer treatment method. He says the whole thing is
     quite simple. This brought rapid remission in patients given up on by
     other doctors. </li>
<li>The FDA has stated that
     because colloidal silver is accepted as a pre-1938 medication, it may
     continue to be marketed. Letter, 13 September 1991, received from consumer
     safety officer Harold Davis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. </li>
<li>""Colloidal
     Preparations of Silver in Pharmacy,"" <i>British Medical Journal</i>,
     February 1923: ""Pure Silver is entirely non-irritant. In tests at
     very high concentrations, it has been shown repeatedly that the rapidly
     exerted disinfectant action is of considerable therapeutic value."" </li>
<li>Dr. Otto Warberg (Nobel
     Prize Winner, 1932) stated that ""Cancer is caused by the lack of
     oxygen and the fermentation of sugars."" </li>

One solution to 3 problems- get PURE 99.9% water- instantly at low cost.


Water-H2O is LIFE, without it we expire in 72+ hours.


If we put an ordinary glass of water- bottled or tap water
under a microscope we see micro bugs and virus, bacteria and contaminants= not good. We need to change this and with your help we can bring
out a simple way to purify weak or dead water to live and pure H2O.
The fastest water purifier on the
planet at lowest cost-use anywhere, anytime.
The simple secret- purify your own water adding Electrolytes, high PH  and Silver in 30 seconds to live many years longer and  boost your Energy levels higher learning to get Oxygen into our system= High Octane H2O Zen.
After 1 hour the silver suspension drops to reveal 99.9% pure h2o OXYGEN enriched. this means= very good stuff, Magic Mojo, the real thing...

                                   
Bottom line, 80% of people are dehydrated and highly Acidic lacking in Energy, so we provide Hydration Purification Alkalinization Nutrients Energy Oxygen in 30 seconds of your time to enrich your life.                   

We are using basic Science and H2O Nano Technology to solve a big problem, Water is
Life yet only 2% of all water on Earth is drinkable so we have to find a way to
purify more of it quickly and safely and
we need to drink a minimum 2 litres per day per person.You can transform ordinary bottled water, tap water, river
or lake water, well or ground supply, rain or ice melt and convert to PURE
drinking water in under 2 minutes- for Daily use- Home, Office, School or Camping
to Survival use.
        If you're stuck on bottled water, that's fine you can just order our assemblyto purify to 99.9 and fits any bottle perfectly for 30 seconds, then store it. $19.


This looks like an ordinary bottle until you notice it has 2 x
99.99% certified Silver electrodes and can be powered by 9v or 12v power=Fully Portable anywhere.
       
2 styles of BPA free sports bottle 20/25 oz or Glass bottle best for hygene shortly.Simple directions anyone can follow from age 5 to 95!!

1-Open the cap, drop in a pinch or 1/8 teaspoon of our Natural
additive Electrolyte powder. No preservatives- chemicals- chlorine or extra
salt—all bad for you.
2-Put in water to be purified and connect to 9v battery. Run 30 seconds.-If you are using a new 9v battery or 12v power- you will find 15 seconds enough for your taste.
3-Watch as water transforms by Electrolysis- the +positive gives off
a silvery cloud as –negative gives out Millions of air bubbles(aeration and oxygen) to
convert and PURIFY to 99.9%.- facinating to watch for young and old and super
fast!!!
4-Disconnect 9v and enjoy drinking pure water. We are giving you the freedom to control your water purity and health= H2O Zen peace of mind.
                  
FASTER TO PURIFY THAN TO MAKE A CUP OF COFFEE!!!!.
Time to Purify. 
600ml/20 oz to 1 lt/35oz
* Bottled water-  30 seconds* Tap water   1 MINUTE –1st world countries* Tap water  
4 MINUTES -3rd world Africa,Mexico,Far East, SAmerica, Caribbean* River/lake  2 MINUTES for stagnant ponds 4 minutes+* Rain water  3 MINUTES* Dirty water  4 MINUTES*Survival h2o 7 MINUTES
this applies to bad, old or dirty or contaminated water where nothing else is
available- these estimates need simple adjusting as you see fit - if it seems clean =low purify, if it's ugly dirty= long purify.
For anyone needing drinkable water, inactivates viruses,
bacteria, Giardia and Cryptosporidium killing 99.9% of all organiisms
and up to 150 forms of pathogens.


Where can you use this? Everywhere, HOME, OFFICE, SCHOOL, SPORTS...
                
How does this work?
                       We are doing the simple way as illustrated on the right-  a short burst of Electrolysis to release minor nano silver, sanitize and purify rapidly... if this can move water from low purity of 80 to 99.9%,  what this will do for your body and health? We are adding LIFE and ENERGY to plain water, cleaning it and vitalising as well as adding ph 8.5 to bring balance to Body and Mind. Silver has been used for centuries and millions do attest to it's benefits from the times of Romans and Greeks.This is not Colloidal Silver-that process takes 30 to 90 minutes and uses distilled or purified water from a chemist- we focus on pure drinking water.Easy to carry                                                                  the product range

""Use of Colloids in
     Health and Disease."" Colloidal silver has proven particularly
     effective in cases of intestinal troubles. Dr. Henry Crooks found that
     ""silver in the colloidal state is highly germicidal, quite harmless
     to humans and absolutely non-toxic. Rather than in a chemical compound,
     the silver in the colloidal state may be applied in a much more
     concentrated form, with correspondingly better results. All virus, fungus,
     bacterium, streptococcus, staphylococcus, and other pathogenic organisms
     are killed in three or four minutes upon contact. There are no side
     effects whatsoever from the highest concentrations."" 
Dr. Robert Becker, "" The
     Body Electric,"" recognized a correlation between low silver
     levels and sickness. He said the silver deficiency was responsible for the
     improper functioning of the immune system. Dr. Becker's experiments
     conclude that silver works on the full spectrum of pathogens without any
     side effects or damage to any part of the body. He also states that the silver
     was doing something more than killing disease organisms. It was also
     causing major growth stimulation of injured tissues. Burn patients and
     elderly patients noticed more rapid healing. He discovered that all cancer
     cells change back to normal cells. All strains of pathogens resistant to
     other antibiotics are killed by colloidal silver. Yet at that time he
     couldn't find a silver supplement on the market. 
""Silver, Our Mightiest
     Germ Fighter,"" ScienceDigest, March 1978. As an antibiotic,
     colloidal silver kills over 650 disease causing organisms, and resistant
     strains fail to develop. Silver is the best all-around germ fighter we
     have and is absolutely non-toxic! Doctors report that, taken internally,
     it works against syphilis, cholera, malaria, diabetes and severe burns.
     Richard L. Davies, executive director of the Silver Institute which
     monitors silver technology in 37 countries, reports: ""In four years
     we've described 87 important new medical uses for silver."" 
Dr. Bjorn Nordstrom, of the
     Karolinska Institute, Sweden,
     has used silver in his cancer treatment method. He says the whole thing is
     quite simple. This brought rapid remission in patients given up on by
     other doctors. 
The FDA has stated that
     because colloidal silver is accepted as a pre-1938 medication, it may
     continue to be marketed. Letter, 13 September 1991, received from consumer
     safety officer Harold Davis, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
""Colloidal
     Preparations of Silver in Pharmacy,"" British Medical Journal,
     February 1923: ""Pure Silver is entirely non-irritant. In tests at
     very high concentrations, it has been shown repeatedly that the rapidly
     exerted disinfectant action is of considerable therapeutic value."" 
Dr. Otto Warberg (Nobel
     Prize Winner, 1932) stated that ""Cancer is caused by the lack of
     oxygen and the fermentation of sugars.""

     1992, page D1: ""Colloidal Silver as a Remedy for AIDS.quot;

     germicidal action, calling a stabilized form: Mild Silver Protein. There
     are several concentrations of Mild Silver Protein.

More and more people are dying from medical conditions which are preventable.  This project focuses on cardiovascular screening in Kenya; a country who's mortality associated with cardiovascular disease is comparable to that of cancer.  This project will see us partner with local clinics, hospitals and universities to develop a sustainable model of cardiovascular disease screening for rural farming populations which currently have limited access to primary care.

Background
Infectious diseases such as HIV and Malaria have traditionally received mass media attention as priority health concerns in developing nations.  However, little attention has been given to the non-communicable diseases which are equally as important and easily preventable. In May 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) assembly strongly supported the urgent need to find innovative, affordable and effective means for early detection, prevention and management for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer in developing countries such as Kenya.  


The Problem Millions of people in Kenya are suffering from chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes-all that are easily preventable and treatable.Kenya is a developing country that has
experienced great growth in infrastructure, economic development and GDP over
the last few years. As a result, many Kenyans have experienced more wealth and
as a result many people have been engaging in a more sedentary lifestyle and
enjoying indulgences which were previously unaffordable. These factors have
contributed to the rise of chronic diseases in Kenya, similar to many other
countries in the developing world. In urban centers, individuals are likely have more access to primary care services. However in the majority  of rural Kenyan communities, there are limited health care facilities, hence most face limitations in access.  According to 2014 WHO data Kenya currently does not have an operational policy,
strategy or action plan to reduce unhealthy diet, reduce physical inactivity
and promote lifestyle modification for cardiovascular disease prevention. In
addition, there currently are no evidence-based national
guidelines/protocols/standards for the management of major Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDS) through a
primary care approach.

Our SolutionBy partnering with local health centers and social enterprises, such as Farm Shop we are implementing a community based cardiovascular screening program offered directly in the Farm Shop Franchieses so that it is easily accessible to rural farming communities. When farmers go to their local Farm Shop store to buy agricultural products, they will be offered health screening at the same time. In addition, nurses will visit local farming communities and provide health seminars on how to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases. By combining a screening and education model that is community based and accessible, we are hoping to show that this type of intervention is effective, cost-efficient, sustainable and scale-able.

Hence, by integrating a screening program through Farm Shop's network, we can potential improve the health of hundreds of thousands of Kenyans in the near future. Use of FundsIn order to successfully implement this pilot program we need help with purchasing equipment such as blood pressure monitors, hiring local Kenyan Nurses and training local support staff to ensure sustainability of the program. Your donation to this campaign will ensure that our initial test pilot program in the Kiambu region of Kenya will be successful.Pilot Project: In Fall 2015, we will be testing our project in 5 Farm Shop franchise outlets, all located in Kiambu Kenya - just north of Nairobi city.Project Partners
This project relies on bringing partner organizations together - we are leveraging a network of 40+ rural community hubs (through Farm Shop), satellite primary medical clinics (through the Aga Khan University Hospital) and local medical training colleges.



Farm Shop is a social enterprise striving to become the most trusted agribusiness platform for smallholder farmers across Africa. Drawing on the principles of successful franchising around the world, Farm Shop is building a franchise network of agri-dealers located in rural, undeserved areas of Kenya.

<p><b>Why I Decided to Take Control of My Health!</b></p>
<p>My name is Jarik Conrad. I, like many of you, have a family history of chronic disease. I lost two sisters way too early – Rita at 35 to cancer and Chandra at 47 to a heart attack.</p>
<p>About a decade ago, after a lifetime of eating fast-food, processed food and a diet full of animal products, I learned my cholesterol was dangerously high. My doctor prescribed me a statin and informed me that I would most likely take it for the rest of my life!</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Not satisfied with that prognosis, I began educating myself about health and nutrition and began making changes to my diet. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Today I am prescription drug-free and my cholesterol has dropped more than 140 points!</span><br/></p>

The whole project will cost me about $5,000 so please help me raise this funding, and support your friends who are participating in this challenge!

<h3>What is this about?</h3>
On March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2015, me and my (now defunct) start-up in Greece,
are taking to the Athens Courts, a major multi-billion, multi-national corporation. We are claiming damages amounting to 9,903,502.00 Euros from the actions of the defendants. </div><div>
<b>I need your help to meet the legal fees (the court stamp duty and other miscellaneous charges to the Greek State that amount to 108,859.30 Euros) for fighting this case. </b><br/>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><h3>
</h3><div>
</div><p>Please do not get intimidated by the amount required - I realize that it is astronomical for most of us. Yet, I feel that we can cover it through the strength of this medium, and through word of mouth. </p><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><ul>
<b>
</b><li>
<b>Every pound donated and time you take to spread this cause means a lot.</b>
</li>
<li>
If you cannot make a contribution yourself, <b>do pass this story on to a friend who may relate to</b>, and be able to help me.
</li>
<li>
<b>
If you have friends in the media let them know of my campaign</b> - they may find it newsworthy as it is the first crowdfunding campaign for such a cause in Greece.<br/>

</div><p></p><div>
</div><h3>
<a name=""events"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What exactly happened?</h3><div>
Providing much detail at this stage is not an option because of a threat of defamation and other legal action by the all-powerful multinational that we cannot even name. <br/>
The case (in brief), however, deals with unconventional practices that local executives employed after signing a business agreement, that subsequently led them to taking actions that generated huge losses to the start-up. <br/>According to a valuation by two leading Greek Economics professors at the Universities of Athens and Cambridge, the “product” was VRIN (valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable) - an extremely innovative and lucrative solution estimated to bring in revenues to the tune of 4 million Euros per annum to my company, and over 50 million Euros to the 
multinational. <br/>We stopped all collaboration following this ruin and also brought in the parent company in an attempt to solve the dispute. Yet, the local actors' position was that they did nothing wrong, and everything was coincidental.<br/>It took us over four years and a change of five different law firms to investigate the case in Greece and the United States, and on September 2014 we managed to file and serve the lawsuit in the Greek Courts.
</div><p></p><div>
</div><h3>
<a name=""whysomuch"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Why do we need so much money?</h3><div>The examination of civil cases in Greece requires a stamp duty to the tune of 0.8% of the total claim. Factoring in other duties brings the total amount that needs to be deposited with the Greek State to 108,859.30 Euros.<br/>There are additional legal and administrative fees as well, e.g., expenses for the valuators of the damages and depositions (some of them have to be incurred in the USA and the UK). Finally, between 7 and 14% will also be charged as handling fees from indiegogo and for the credit card\Paypal clearing process.<br/>Thankfully, our team of lawyers is working on contingencies; the team, however, cannot finance such a case. <br/>Funding has previously been sought from specialised firms in the United States and the United Kingdom, but we were quick to realise that few invest in a lawsuit in Greece because of the high risks involved. <br/>Your charity is thus the only option.<br/>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><h3>
<a name=""ourchances"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What are the chances of a win?</h3><div>
As far as we are concerned, the actions of the defendants were illegal. Yet it is upon the court to take this decision. 
Given the severity of the case and the gravity of the circumstances, the Greek Court has duly accepted our application for a fast-track trial within 6 months (rather than the usual 2-3 years): this happens very rarely and adds to our confidence in this cause. An additional benefit is that fast-track trials rarely get postponed (adjourned); the verdict usually announced within 2-3 months from the hearing. So, we will, hopefully, receive a verdict by June 2015.</div><p></p><div>
</div><h3>
<a name=""incaseofwin"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What happens if we win?</h3><div>
</div><div>I expect to do the following if the case is won:</div><div>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Transfer back to your accounts all the money that you put into this campaign.</li>
<li>Pay all the dues owed to the Greek State and settle any other remaining dues.</li>
<li>Close the company and concentrate on my research on the modelling and quantification of Transparency here at the University of Oxford.</li>
<li>Use 75% of the remaining proceeds to establish an Oxford-based fund to:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Assist youth with Asperger's by instating a full scholarship to fund one Aspie's postgraduate degree in Philosophy and Computer Science at the Exeter College, University of Oxford every year. I am myself an Aspie and feel that if I didn't possess the loyalty and perseverance typical to my kind, I wouldn’t have gone through
what I did (click <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152975393947699.1073741852.599367698&amp;type=1&amp;l=e1526a870a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here to see me participate in a University of Oxford study on high-IQ Aspies</a>). </li>
<li>Earmark an amount for research on ALS for the Israeli ALS Association. My father died
from ALS and I have 1 in 6 chances of dying from it myself - the investigation and monitoring of research within this domain is thus a personal endeavour (click <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCGgb7rV69s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here to see my ice bucket challenge).</a>
</li>
<li>Support research on the modelling and quantification of 'Transparency' and 'Accountability'.</li>
</ol>
<li>Give 25% of the proceeds to an established NGO involved with the incubation of start-ups and entrepreneurship for young Greeks. This NGO is an initiative by the businessman who invested in my own start-up. I also hope to forge a collaboration between Isis - the Technology Transfer Unit of the University of Oxford, and the NGO for this endeavour. </li>
<p></p>
<h3>
<a name=""incaseofdefeat"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What happens if we lose?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I will be destroyed. Unlike other entrepreneurs who, when faced with
problems, go for Chapter 11 protection or declare bankruptcy, I chose to keep the
company and take responsibility
for the dues owed to every individual, down
to the last penny. I know that I was tricked and defrauded, but I believe that
justice will be served. </li>
<li>I will most likely end up with a criminal record and, apart from the downfall in the last five years, my future will also be in tatters.</li>
<li>Despite the loss, I will be able to be true to myself and my values. This is the first crowdsourcing campaign for such matters in Greece. My late father, some forty years ago, completed the first hunger strike in Greece successfully fighting for better education (see him <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152389739202699&amp;l=01f8981cc8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here with Melina Mercuri</a>, or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152393346982699&amp;l=fe3c206fd6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">making front page news</a> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152393346982699&amp;l=fe3c206fd6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">with the whole family</a>, or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2i_IZ39geE#t=4466"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">watch this documentary where he shares his strike story</a>). I have been raised with the same values. My father got justice, and I am inspired by his story to believe that I will, too.</li>
<li>I will be able to leave this as a legacy for my children - to motivate them to keep fighting for what is right.   </li>
</ul>
I hope you understand that I wouldn’t publicly ask anyone to put a penny into something that I don't first believe in myself. This is something truly personal.

<h3>
<a name=""inanycase"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>What happens anyways - win or lose?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Over 85% of your money will go to the Greek State (which is in need of money).</li>
<li>You will receive a detailed account of where your money went, the progress of the campaign and the case. For example, you will be able to follow media coverage and reactions to this campaign.</li>
<li>I might publish and e-distribute a book that I have written on my experiences - a book that was written since I moved to the UK in 2012, leaving behind my 8 and 5 year-old kids, who I thought I might never see again (considering the complications with the lawsuit), but who I wished would at least know what their father was really like, through a record of life experiences that they could at least read about.   </li>

<h3><b>Can you imagine the positive consequences of your actions if we win?</b></h3>
<p>A huge, multi-billion, multi-national corporation will eventually end up saving an aspie and becoming, through him, a supporter of other Aspies by contributing to ALS-related research, together with research that attempts to quantify Transparency and Accountability in world-leading research institutions. </p>

No, this is not an inflated description of me - it applies equally to all of us, as this is what we humans exist for. <br/>Coming back to me, I am not just referring to the 3 pounds I donated to Wikipedia or the 5 pounds I gave a couple of weeks ago to that
student in Preston who, following some unexpected help from a homeless person,
established a fund to help him to find a place to stay. I am, instead, referring to the larger part of my life that I have spent working on innovative endeavours that most people couldn’t

<a name=""oxford"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Why support me while I am studying/researching at Oxford?</h3>
I came to Oxford to pursue research on transparency, instigated by my experiences with corruption and by the realisation that the medical industry might be more amenable to collaborations on curative medicine should their individual contributions be adequately quantified and safeguarded via appropriate knowledge transfer technology. My aim is to quantify the notion of transparency. This is a deeply philosophical endeavour that i wish to commit the rest of my life to.<br/><span>Having been told that the best place in the world for this research is Oxford (as critical parts relating to my research were actually invented here), I came here with the references of </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Furber</a><span> (the designer of the ARM microprocessor that powers over 90% of the mobile devices world wide) and </span><a href=""http://www.rand.org/about/people/d/dewar_james_a.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Dewar</a><span> (the founding director of RAND's Frederick S. Pardee Center for Longer Range Global Policy and the Future Human Condition).<br/></span><span>Corruption is not limited to my native country.  The overheads of corruption, lack of transparency and accountability are universal - a global issue that requires global action. Although research is a long-range process, I have already managed to generate ideas with a more immediate impact.

<a name=""greekversion"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Αγώνας για Δικαιοσύνη ενάντια σε μια  πολυεθνική που σκότωσε την καινοτομία και μερικές δεκάδες θέσεις εργασίας<br/><br/>
</h2>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Περί τίνος πρόκειται;</h3>
Την 5η Μαρτίου, συζητείται στο Δικαστήριο της Αθήνας, αγωγή που κατέθεσαν η start-up που ίδρυσα (που τώρα είναι σε αναστολή λειτουργίας) και εγώ προσωπικά, εναντίον μιας μεγάλης πολυεθνικής εταιρείας που με τις ενέργειές της προκάλεσε μεγάλες ζημίες, απώλεια δεκάδων θέσεων δημιουργικής και αξιοπρεπούς εργασίας νέων -σε μια χώρα που κατέχει το αρνητικό ρεκόρ στην ανεργία των νέων- και απώλεια αναπτυξιακών κεφαλαίων από μια επιχείρηση καινοτομίας που θα μορούσαν να δημιουργήσουν περισσότερες θέσεις εργασίας. Ζητάμε να μας αποδοθεί αποζημίωση ύψους 9.990.502,00 Ευρώ, που ήταν αποτέλεσμα των ενεργειών της αντιδίκου. 
<br/><br/><b>Ζητάμε την βοήθεια σας για την κάλυψη των Δικαστικών Εξόδων (το παράβολο στο δικαστήριο και οι διάφορες εισφορές υπέρ του Δημοσίου και Ταμείων υπολογίζονται στις  108.859,30) που απαιτούνται για την διεκδίκηση της αποζημίωσης.<br/></b><br/>Μην συγκρίνετε το ποσό των εξόδων με την διεκδικούμενη αποζημίωση. Φυσικά,ακόμη και το ποσό των σχεδόν 109 χιλιάδων Ευρώ είναι αστρονομικό για κάθε έναν από μας ξεχωριστά. Με την κοινωνική δύναμη της συλλογικής υποστήριξης από τους πολίτες του διαδικτύου όμως μπορεί να καλυφθεί. <br/>Αν <b>δώσετε έστω και ένα Ευρώ σημαίνει πολλά</b>. <br/>Ακόμα και <b>αν δεν έχετε την δυνατότητα να συνεισφέρετε οικονομικά, το να διαδώσετε αυτή την προσπάθεια σε μια φίλη ή έναν φίλο</b> σας που μπορεί να ενδιαφερθεί και ίσως να έχει τη δυνατότητα να βοηθήσει, θα είναι είναι τεράστια βοήθεια! <br/>Επίσης, <b>αν έχετε φίλους στα Μέσα Μαζικής Ενημέρωσης πείτε τους για την προσπάθεια</b>. Ισως βρουν ενδιαφέρουσα την είδηση ότι γίνεται για πρώτη φορά στην Ελλάδα μια τέτοια προσπάθεια – αν μη τι άλλο είναι «νέο».<br/>
Στη συνέχεια θα βρείτε πληροφορίες <a href=""#eventsgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">για το τι ακριβώς συνέβη</a>, <a href=""#whysomuchgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">γιατί χρειάζονται τόσα πολλά χρήματα</a>, <a href=""#ourchancesgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">για το ποιές είναι οι πιθανότητες να νικήσουμε</a>, <a href=""#incaseofwingr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">για το τι θα γίνει αν κερδίσουμε</a>, <a href=""#incaseofdefeatgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">για το τι θα γίνει αν χάσουμε</a>, <a href=""#inanycasegr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">για το τι θα γίνει σε κάθε περίπτωση</a>, αλλά και αναλυτικές λεπτομέρειες για την διαδρομή <a href=""#whoyousupportgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">υτού που βοηθάτε</a> και για την σημερινή του δραστηριότητα ως <a href=""#oxfordgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">μεταπτυχιακού ερευνητή στο Πανεπιστήμιο της Οξφόρδης</a> καθώς και γιατί <a href=""#whyindiegr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">η καμπάνια μας τρέχει στο indiegogo</a>. 

<br/><br/><h3>
<a name=""eventsgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Τι ακριβώς συνέβη;</h3>
Δυστυχώς δεν έχουμε την δυνατότητα να δώσουμε λεπτομέρειες σ’ αυτήν τη φάση καθότι υπάρχουν απειλές-κίνδυνοι για αγωγές για συκοφαντική δυσφήμηση από την παντοδύναμη πολυεθνική, την οποία δεν μπορούμε καν να ονομάσουμε.<br/> 
Μπορούμε όμως να πούμε ότι η υπόθεση αφορά αντισυμβατική συμπεριφορά από τα ντόπια στελέχη της πολυεθνικής, αφότου μάλιστα η πολυεθνική είχε υπογράψει την συνεργασία. Αποτέλεσμα των ενεργειών αυτών από την πολυεθνική ήταν η πρόκληση τεράστιων ζημιών στο start-up, που είχε φτάσει να απασχολεί 30 πτυχιούχους ΑΕΙ μέσα σε δύο χρόνια λειτουργίας του. <br/>Το «προϊόν» της συνεργασίας μας είχε κριθεί ως εξαιρετικά καινοτόμο και προσοδοφόρο, αφού επρόκειτο για VRIN (valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable - πολύτιμο, σπάνιο, μη αντιγράψιμο και μη αντικαταστήσιμο) και υπολογιζόταν ότι θα έφερνε ετήσια έσοδα περί τα 4 εκατ. ευρώ στην εταιρεία μας και 50 εκατ. ευρώ στον πολυεθνικό συνεργάτη μας. Αυτά τα διαφυγόντα κέρδη, πέραν από το επιχειρηματικό πλάνο που εγκρίθηκε από την πολυεθνική, είχαν υπολογιστεί με ακρίβεια από κορυφαίους Έλληνες Ακαδημαϊκούς στον τομέα των οικονομικών, που διδάσκουν στα Πανεπιστήμια Αθηνών και Κείμπριτζ.  Καταγγείλαμε τη σύμβαση και ενημερώσαμε την μητρική εταιρεία που προσπάθησε να παρέμβει και να επιλύσει την διαφορά. Ωστόσο οι ντόπιοι συνεργάτες της δεν επέτρεψαν την συνέχιση της συνεργασίας και ισχυρίστηκαν ότι δεν έκαναν τίποτα το μεμπτό...,ισχυριζόμενοι ότι όλες οι «ατυχίες» σε πολύ κρίσιμα σημεία της συνεργασίας ήταν συμπωματικές.  
Το αποτέλεσμα ήταν να χαθούν περί τις 30 θέσεις εργασίας, νέων επιστημόνων, όλοι αποφοίτοι ΑΕΙ, η πλειοψηφία με μεταπτυχιακά, και κορυφαίων στον τομέα τους. Ετσι, μια δυναμική ελληνική εταιρεία που υπερδιπλασίαζε τον τζίρο της κάθε χρόνο και είχε σημαντικές αναπτυξιακές προοπτικές (ενδεικτικά: κάθε χρόνο προσέθετε περίπου 15 νέες θέσεις εργασίας) βρέθηκε να αντιμετωπίζει προβλήματα. 
Μας πήρε πάνω από τέσσερα χρόνια και πέντε διαφορετικές εταιρείες δικηγόρων για να ερευνήσουμε την υπόθεση στην Ελλάδα και στις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες για να αποδείξουμε ότι όχι μόνο τυχαία δεν ήταν όσα έγινα αλλά ήταν και παράνομα και τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2014 καταθέσαμε και κοινοποιήσαμε την αγωγή μας.
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<a name=""whysomuchgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Γιατί χρειαζόμαστε τόσα πολλά χρήματα;</h3>
Η εξέταση των αστικών υποθέσεων στα ελληνικά δικαστήρια γίνεται με την κατάθεση παράβολου ύψους 0,8% επί του ύψους της απαίτησης και επιπρόσθετες συνεισφορές, χαρτόσημα κλπ. σε διάφορα Ταμεία του Δημοσίου: στη δική μας περίπτωση το ποσό αυτό έχει υπολογιστεί σις  108.859,30 Ευρώ.
<br/>Επίσης υπάρχουν πρόσθετα νομικά και διαχειριστικά έξοδα και παράβολα, π.χ. τα έξοδα των πραγματογνωμόνων, το κόστος των ένορκων καταθέσεων παρουσία συμβολαιογράφου (ορισμένες καταθέσεις θα γίνουν στις ΗΠΑ και το Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο). 
<br/>Το διαχειριστικό κόστος του indiegogo και της εκκαθάρισης των πληρωμών από πιστωτικές κάρτες κλπ. είναι μεταξύ 8% και 14% του συνόλου των χρημάτων αναλόγως του άν θα πετύχουμε τον στόχο μας, τύπο πληρωμής κλπ. 
Ευτυχώς, οι δικηγόροι μας έχουν πάρει την υπόθεση εργολαβικά με ποσοστό. Όμως η νομική μας ομάδα δεν έχει τα κεφάλαια για να χρηματοδοτήσει μια τόσο μεγάλη υπόθεση.
<br/>Προσπαθήσαμε να βρούμε χρηματοδότηση από εταιρείες που επενδύουν σε δικαστικές υποθέσεις στην Μεγάλη Βρετανία και τις ΗΠΑ, αλλά σύντομα καταλάβαμε ότι, παρά το δίκιο μας, κανένας ξένος δεν πρόκειται να επενδύσει σε μια νομική υπόθεση στην Ελλάδα, δεδομένης της δυσφήμησης για την διαφθορά και την έλλειψη διαφάνειας στην χώρα, μην εμπιστευόμενοι το νομικό μας σύστημα. Εμείς, αντίθετα, πιστεύουμε στην ελληνική Δικαιοσύνη. 
<p>
</p>
<h3>
<a name=""ourchancesgr"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Τι πιθανότητες έχουμε για να νικήσουμε;</h3>
Σε ό,τι μας αφορά είμαστε πεπεισμένοι ότι οι ενέργειες των κατηγορουμένων ήταν παράνομες. Φυσικά, αυτό θα το αποφασίσει η Ελληνική Δικαιοσύνη.<br/> Οι ζημιές μας έχουν υπολογιστεί με μεγάλη ακρίβεια από κορυφαίους Ελληνες Ακαδημαϊκούς στον τομέα των Οικονομικών στα Πανεπιστήμια της Αθήνας και του Κείμπριτζ. <br/>Δεδομένης της σοβαρότητας και της βαρύτητας της υπόθεσης, η Ελληνική Δικαιοσύνη δέχτηκε το αίτημά μας για κατά προτίμηση εκδίκαση της αγωγής, έτσι λάβαμε δικάσιμο σε 6 μήνες (αντί 2-3 ετών): αυτό συμβαίνει πολύ σπάνια, και μας κάνει ιδιαίτερα αισιόδοξους για τον αγώνα μας. <br/>Επιπρόσθετα οφέλη των εκδικάσεων κατά προτίμηση είναι ότι σπάνια (ως ποτέ) αναβάλλονται οι δίκες, ενώ η απόφαση ανακοινώνεται 2-3 μήνες μετά την εκδίκαση. Συνεπώς, καλώς εχόντων των πραγμάτων, θα έχουμε την απόφαση τον Ιούνιο του 2015. 
<p>
</p>

Μετά τις επιχειρηματικές ατυχίες και έχοντας διαπιστώσει την περιορισμένη συνεργασία των επιστημονικών ομάδων που ασχολούνται με την ανακάλυψη των αιτιών ή φαρμάκων των ασθενειών όπως του πατέρα μου, σκέφτηκα ότι κάτι πρέπει να κάνω γι αυτό. Δηλαδή για να περιοριστεί θεσμικά η διαφθορά, να μην τύχει σε κανέναν αυτιστικό αυτό που έτυχε σε μένα, και ταυτόχρονα να επιταχυνθεί η ασφαλής διάδοση ιδεών μεταξύ ερευνητικών ομάδων. Κατόπιν συζητήσεων με φίλους Μαθηματικούς και Φιλόσοφους καταλήξαμε ότι αν καταφέρναμε να φτιάξουμε ένα μοντέλο που θα βοηθούσε στην ποσοτικοποίηση της Διαφάνειας, ίσως να δίναμε λύση και στα δύο προβλήματα. Όσο πέρναγε ο καιρός άρχισαν να αποκρυσταλλώνονται οι σκέψεις μου και σε συνεργασία με τους μέντορές μου -που συμμετέχουν σε ορισμένα από τα κορυφαία think tanks του κόσμου- σκεφτόμασταν πως κάτι τέτοιο μπορεί να τρέξει (αυτά συνέβαιναν ενώ επέβλεπα την κατάρρευση του start-up και φρόντιζα τον μελλοθάνατο πατέρα μου). Μου έγιναν διάφορες προτάσεις να εκπονήσω την έρευνά μου σε διάφορα ινστιτούτα και χώρες όμως εγώ προτιμούσα την Αγγλία. Όχι για κανέναν άλλον λόγο αλλά γιατί όλη η μέχρι τώρα πανεπιστημιακή μου παιδεία οφείλεται στο εκπαιδευτικό σύστημα της Μεγάλης Βρετανίας (είχα έρθει εδώ από 17 ετών και έχω ήδη έναν προπτυχιακό και δύο μεταπτυχιακούς τίτλους). Έτσι, έλεγα, ότι αν αυτό που θα κάνουμε θα έχει αξία, θέλω αυτή η αξία ν’ ανήκει, πρωτίστως, σ’ αυτή τη χώρα. Μάλιστα, αρχικά ήθελα να δουλέψω την έρευνα στο πρώτο μου Πανεπιστήμιο,στο Μάντσεστερ. Έτσι, πήγα στο Μάντσεστερ να δω τον καθηγητή που επηρέασε πολύ τη σκέψη μου όντας προπτυχιακός, και του παρουσιάσαμε -μαζί με τον μέντορά μου- την ιδέα. Αφού συζητήσαμε για ώρες, αφού κοιμηθήκαμε με τις ιδέες που πέσαν στον τραπέζι, την επόμενη μέρα ο καθηγητής μου, πρότεινε ότι το καλύτερο μέρος στον κόσμο για την έρευνά μου είναι το Πανεπιστήμιο της Οξφόρδης, καθότι πολλά από τα στοιχεία που θα μου χρειάζονταν, έχουν εφευρεθεί εδώ. Και έτσι βρέθηκα εδώ με τις συστατικές του <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Furber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Furber</a> (του αρχιτέκτονα των επεξεργαστών ARM που βρίσκονται σε πάνω από 90% των κινητών τηλεφώνων/tablets κλπ.) και του <a href=""http://www.rand.org/about/people/d/dewar_james_a.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Dewar</a> (του οποίου οι θεωρίες βοηθούν στην πρόβλεψη του μακρινού μέλλοντος).  Τα πεδίο της έρευνάς μου φυσικά είναι τεράστιο, όμως στην πορεία έχω καταφέρει να βγάλω κάποια ενδιάμεσα προϊόντα. Δυστυχώς και αυτά τα προϊόντα είναι λίγο πιο μπροστά από την εποχή τους ενώ τον λίγο χρόνο που έχω για «επιχειρηματικά θέματα» τον αφιερώνω για την πρόοδο της αγωγής.  Έτσι δεν έχω καταφέρει ακόμη να βγάλω χρήματα και άρα το crowdfunding είναι μονόδρομος. 
<p>
Γνωρίζω καλά τα στερεότυπα που υπάρχουν στην πατρίδα μας για διάσημα πανεπιστήμια όπως η Οξφόρδη. Και ίσως να σας ξενίζει το πώς κάποιος που είναι εδώ ζητάει τα δικά σας χρήματα ενώ έχετε να πληρώσετε τόσα και τόσα. Να έχετε υπόψη σας πάντως ότι η Οξφόρδη είναι ένα σύγχρονο Άγιο Όρος. Η συνάφεια μεγάλη, γιατί και τα Κολλέγια μας εδώ είναι Μοναστήρια, και άλλωστε ιδρύθηκε με το Άγιο Όρος ως πρότυπο. Για τους περισσότερους από εμάς είναι απλά ένα πολύ απαιτητικό μοναστήρι. Ναι, υπάρχουν και φοιτητές (ή καθηγητές) με αριστοκρατικές καταβολές, όμως δεν είναι αυτό που ίσως έχετε στο νου σας από τα διαφημιστικά. Για μένα απλά είναι το κλείσιμο ενός κύκλου που ξεκίνησε στο Άγιο Όρος όταν πήγα 15 ετών για να επιλύσω διάφορες αναζητήσεις μου (ναι, συναντήθηκα και με τον Παΐσιο, ο οποίος και αγιοποιήθηκε τις προάλλες σε μια ημέρα σημαντική για μένα). Η Οξφόρδη είναι ένα ιερό μέρος και όπως όλα τα ιερά είναι all things to all people. Ο καθένας βρίσκει και παίρνει ότι του αξίζει. Ξέρω ότι κινδυνεύω να γίνω πολύ μελό άρα περισσότερα στο βιβλίο που ίσως κάποτε εκδώσω.

Όμως ενημερώθηκα από τον παλαιό φίλο και συνεργάτη Χάρη Καρώνη (που τρέχει μια από τις καλύτερες και πλέον καινοτόμες εταιρείες Ιντερνετ στην Ελλάδα, τη Viva) ότι δυστυχώς η Ελληνική Νομοθεσία δεν προβλέπει δωρεές μέσω Ιντερνέτ για ποσά που υπερβαίνουν τις 2500 ευρώ. Συνεπώς ήταν επιβεβλημένη αυτή η λύση. 
Η indiegogo παρείχε άμεση υποστήριξη ενώ από πίσω της βρίσκονται επενδυτές όπως ο Sir Richard Branson (ο πλέον αγαπημένος μου Βρεττανός επιχειρηματίας, μετά τον Sir Clive Sinclair) και έτσι βρεθήκαμε εδώ. Θέλω να πω είναι μια ιδιαίτερα σοβαρή και ασφαλής πλατφόρμα.<br/>

What is this about?
On March 5th, 2015, me and my (now defunct) start-up in Greece,
are taking to the Athens Courts, a major multi-billion, multi-national corporation. We are claiming damages amounting to 9,903,502.00 Euros from the actions of the defendants. 
I need your help to meet the legal fees (the court stamp duty and other miscellaneous charges to the Greek State that amount to 108,859.30 Euros) for fighting this case. 



Please do not get intimidated by the amount required - I realize that it is astronomical for most of us. Yet, I feel that we can cover it through the strength of this medium, and through word of mouth. 




Every pound donated and time you take to spread this cause means a lot.


If you cannot make a contribution yourself, do pass this story on to a friend who may relate to, and be able to help me.



If you have friends in the media let them know of my campaign - they may find it newsworthy as it is the first crowdfunding campaign for such a cause in Greece.




It will be great if you can help me by offering me your support when I need it the most.
The sections below address the following questions (click on the hyperlinks to reach them directly): (i) what exactly happened? (ii) why do we need so much money? (iii) what are the chances of a win? (iv) what happens if we win? (v) what happens if we lose? (vi) what happens anyways - win or lose? (vii) who are you supporting with your charity? (vii) why support me when I am studying/researching at Oxford? and (viii) why indiegogo?


What exactly happened?
Providing much detail at this stage is not an option because of a threat of defamation and other legal action by the all-powerful multinational that we cannot even name. 
The case (in brief), however, deals with unconventional practices that local executives employed after signing a business agreement, that subsequently led them to taking actions that generated huge losses to the start-up. According to a valuation by two leading Greek Economics professors at the Universities of Athens and Cambridge, the “product” was VRIN (valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable) - an extremely innovative and lucrative solution estimated to bring in revenues to the tune of 4 million Euros per annum to my company, and over 50 million Euros to the 
multinational. We stopped all collaboration following this ruin and also brought in the parent company in an attempt to solve the dispute. Yet, the local actors' position was that they did nothing wrong, and everything was coincidental.It took us over four years and a change of five different law firms to investigate the case in Greece and the United States, and on September 2014 we managed to file and serve the lawsuit in the Greek Courts.


Why do we need so much money?The examination of civil cases in Greece requires a stamp duty to the tune of 0.8% of the total claim. Factoring in other duties brings the total amount that needs to be deposited with the Greek State to 108,859.30 Euros.There are additional legal and administrative fees as well, e.g., expenses for the valuators of the damages and depositions (some of them have to be incurred in the USA and the UK). Finally, between 7 and 14% will also be charged as handling fees from indiegogo and for the credit card\Paypal clearing process.Thankfully, our team of lawyers is working on contingencies; the team, however, cannot finance such a case. Funding has previously been sought from specialised firms in the United States and the United Kingdom, but we were quick to realise that few invest in a lawsuit in Greece because of the high risks involved. Your charity is thus the only option.


What are the chances of a win?
As far as we are concerned, the actions of the defendants were illegal. Yet it is upon the court to take this decision. 
Given the severity of the case and the gravity of the circumstances, the Greek Court has duly accepted our application for a fast-track trial within 6 months (rather than the usual 2-3 years): this happens very rarely and adds to our confidence in this cause. An additional benefit is that fast-track trials rarely get postponed (adjourned); the verdict usually announced within 2-3 months from the hearing. So, we will, hopefully, receive a verdict by June 2015.

What happens if we win?
I expect to do the following if the case is won:


Transfer back to your accounts all the money that you put into this campaign.
Pay all the dues owed to the Greek State and settle any other remaining dues.
Close the company and concentrate on my research on the modelling and quantification of Transparency here at the University of Oxford.
Use 75% of the remaining proceeds to establish an Oxford-based fund to:


Assist youth with Asperger's by instating a full scholarship to fund one Aspie's postgraduate degree in Philosophy and Computer Science at the Exeter College, University of Oxford every year. I am myself an Aspie and feel that if I didn't possess the loyalty and perseverance typical to my kind, I wouldn’t have gone through
what I did (click here to see me participate in a University of Oxford study on high-IQ Aspies). 
Earmark an amount for research on ALS for the Israeli ALS Association. My father died
from ALS and I have 1 in 6 chances of dying from it myself - the investigation and monitoring of research within this domain is thus a personal endeavour (click here to see my ice bucket challenge).

Support research on the modelling and quantification of 'Transparency' and 'Accountability'.

Give 25% of the proceeds to an established NGO involved with the incubation of start-ups and entrepreneurship for young Greeks. This NGO is an initiative by the businessman who invested in my own start-up. I also hope to forge a collaboration between Isis - the Technology Transfer Unit of the University of Oxford, and the NGO for this endeavour. 


What happens if we lose?

I will be destroyed. Unlike other entrepreneurs who, when faced with
problems, go for Chapter 11 protection or declare bankruptcy, I chose to keep the
company and take responsibility
for the dues owed to every individual, down
to the last penny. I know that I was tricked and defrauded, but I believe that
justice will be served. 
I will most likely end up with a criminal record and, apart from the downfall in the last five years, my future will also be in tatters.
Despite the loss, I will be able to be true to myself and my values. This is the first crowdsourcing campaign for such matters in Greece. My late father, some forty years ago, completed the first hunger strike in Greece successfully fighting for better education (see him here with Melina Mercuri, or making front page news with the whole family, or watch this documentary where he shares his strike story). I have been raised with the same values. My father got justice, and I am inspired by his story to believe that I will, too.
I will be able to leave this as a legacy for my children - to motivate them to keep fighting for what is right.   

I hope you understand that I wouldn’t publicly ask anyone to put a penny into something that I don't first believe in myself. This is something truly personal.



What happens anyways - win or lose?

Over 85% of your money will go to the Greek State (which is in need of money).
You will receive a detailed account of where your money went, the progress of the campaign and the case. For example, you will be able to follow media coverage and reactions to this campaign.
I might publish and e-distribute a book that I have written on my experiences - a book that was written since I moved to the UK in 2012, leaving behind my 8 and 5 year-old kids, who I thought I might never see again (considering the complications with the lawsuit), but who I wished would at least know what their father was really like, through a record of life experiences that they could at least read about.   





Can you imagine the positive consequences of your actions if we win?
A huge, multi-billion, multi-national corporation will eventually end up saving an aspie and becoming, through him, a supporter of other Aspies by contributing to ALS-related research, together with research that attempts to quantify Transparency and Accountability in world-leading research institutions. 

Who are you supporting with your charity?
A person that has supported you, even without your knowledge, and has given (and
continues to give) his charity to others to the best of his knowledge and ability.
No, this is not an inflated description of me - it applies equally to all of us, as this is what we humans exist for. Coming back to me, I am not just referring to the 3 pounds I donated to Wikipedia or the 5 pounds I gave a couple of weeks ago to that
student in Preston who, following some unexpected help from a homeless person,
established a fund to help him to find a place to stay. I am, instead, referring to the larger part of my life that I have spent working on innovative endeavours that most people couldn’t
even see the value of, while they were being developed. 
Here are a few links to get to know me better:

My linkedin profile.

A slideshare presentation in which you can see a portfolio of my contributions towards the growth of the Internet in Greece.
A reference from my mentor at the Ford Motor Company that helped me win an academic scholarship in 1999. It gives you a good picture of who I am, and is written by the only Ford Motor Company Engineer to have received Henry Ford Awards for his contributions to both Product Development and Manufacturing Process Improvement. 




Why support me while I am studying/researching at Oxford?
I came to Oxford to pursue research on transparency, instigated by my experiences with corruption and by the realisation that the medical industry might be more amenable to collaborations on curative medicine should their individual contributions be adequately quantified and safeguarded via appropriate knowledge transfer technology. My aim is to quantify the notion of transparency. This is a deeply philosophical endeavour that i wish to commit the rest of my life to.Having been told that the best place in the world for this research is Oxford (as critical parts relating to my research were actually invented here), I came here with the references of Steve Furber (the designer of the ARM microprocessor that powers over 90% of the mobile devices world wide) and Jim Dewar (the founding director of RAND's Frederick S. Pardee Center for Longer Range Global Policy and the Future Human Condition).Corruption is not limited to my native country.  The overheads of corruption, lack of transparency and accountability are universal - a global issue that requires global action. Although research is a long-range process, I have already managed to generate ideas with a more immediate impact. Yet none of them can be monetized in time for the trial.







Why indiegogo?It is imperative to find a fitting outlet for a global issue that requires global action. Indiegogo has great customer support (or 'customer happiness', as they term it). The fact that Sir Richard Branson (my favourite British entrepreneur after Sir Clive Sinclair) is also part of indiegogo led me to this platform. It will be great if my campaign can help Greek online fundraisers (e.g. supergiftme) enable the lifting of a current legal restriction that limits online donations to 2500 Euros and has a negative impact on all involved (including start-up fund seekers) at a time when there is no other greek-localised service available on global websites.


If you have any queries about me and this campaign please do not hesitate to contact me and I will respond to you here so that others with similar questions can also be satisfied.

Αγώνας για Δικαιοσύνη ενάντια σε μια  πολυεθνική που σκότωσε την καινοτομία και μερικές δεκάδες θέσεις εργασίας

Περί τίνος πρόκειται;
Την 5η Μαρτίου, συζητείται στο Δικαστήριο της Αθήνας, αγωγή που κατέθεσαν η start-up που ίδρυσα (που τώρα είναι σε αναστολή λειτουργίας) και εγώ προσωπικά, εναντίον μιας μεγάλης πολυεθνικής εταιρείας που με τις ενέργειές της προκάλεσε μεγάλες ζημίες, απώλεια δεκάδων θέσεων δημιουργικής και αξιοπρεπούς εργασίας νέων -σε μια χώρα που κατέχει το αρνητικό ρεκόρ στην ανεργία των νέων- και απώλεια αναπτυξιακών κεφαλαίων από μια επιχείρηση καινοτομίας που θα μορούσαν να δημιουργήσουν περισσότερες θέσεις εργασίας. Ζητάμε να μας αποδοθεί αποζημίωση ύψους 9.990.502,00 Ευρώ, που ήταν αποτέλεσμα των ενεργειών της αντιδίκου. 
Ζητάμε την βοήθεια σας για την κάλυψη των Δικαστικών Εξόδων (το παράβολο στο δικαστήριο και οι διάφορες εισφορές υπέρ του Δημοσίου και Ταμείων υπολογίζονται στις  108.859,30) που απαιτούνται για την διεκδίκηση της αποζημίωσης.Μην συγκρίνετε το ποσό των εξόδων με την διεκδικούμενη αποζημίωση. Φυσικά,ακόμη και το ποσό των σχεδόν 109 χιλιάδων Ευρώ είναι αστρονομικό για κάθε έναν από μας ξεχωριστά. Με την κοινωνική δύναμη της συλλογικής υποστήριξης από τους πολίτες του διαδικτύου όμως μπορεί να καλυφθεί. Αν δώσετε έστω και ένα Ευρώ σημαίνει πολλά. Ακόμα και αν δεν έχετε την δυνατότητα να συνεισφέρετε οικονομικά, το να διαδώσετε αυτή την προσπάθεια σε μια φίλη ή έναν φίλο σας που μπορεί να ενδιαφερθεί και ίσως να έχει τη δυνατότητα να βοηθήσει, θα είναι είναι τεράστια βοήθεια! Επίσης, αν έχετε φίλους στα Μέσα Μαζικής Ενημέρωσης πείτε τους για την προσπάθεια. Ισως βρουν ενδιαφέρουσα την είδηση ότι γίνεται για πρώτη φορά στην Ελλάδα μια τέτοια προσπάθεια – αν μη τι άλλο είναι «νέο».
Στη συνέχεια θα βρείτε πληροφορίες για το τι ακριβώς συνέβη, γιατί χρειάζονται τόσα πολλά χρήματα, για το ποιές είναι οι πιθανότητες να νικήσουμε, για το τι θα γίνει αν κερδίσουμε, για το τι θα γίνει αν χάσουμε, για το τι θα γίνει σε κάθε περίπτωση, αλλά και αναλυτικές λεπτομέρειες για την διαδρομή υτού που βοηθάτε και για την σημερινή του δραστηριότητα ως μεταπτυχιακού ερευνητή στο Πανεπιστήμιο της Οξφόρδης καθώς και γιατί η καμπάνια μας τρέχει στο indiegogo. 


Τι ακριβώς συνέβη;
Δυστυχώς δεν έχουμε την δυνατότητα να δώσουμε λεπτομέρειες σ’ αυτήν τη φάση καθότι υπάρχουν απειλές-κίνδυνοι για αγωγές για συκοφαντική δυσφήμηση από την παντοδύναμη πολυεθνική, την οποία δεν μπορούμε καν να ονομάσουμε. 
Μπορούμε όμως να πούμε ότι η υπόθεση αφορά αντισυμβατική συμπεριφορά από τα ντόπια στελέχη της πολυεθνικής, αφότου μάλιστα η πολυεθνική είχε υπογράψει την συνεργασία. Αποτέλεσμα των ενεργειών αυτών από την πολυεθνική ήταν η πρόκληση τεράστιων ζημιών στο start-up, που είχε φτάσει να απασχολεί 30 πτυχιούχους ΑΕΙ μέσα σε δύο χρόνια λειτουργίας του. Το «προϊόν» της συνεργασίας μας είχε κριθεί ως εξαιρετικά καινοτόμο και προσοδοφόρο, αφού επρόκειτο για VRIN (valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable - πολύτιμο, σπάνιο, μη αντιγράψιμο και μη αντικαταστήσιμο) και υπολογιζόταν ότι θα έφερνε ετήσια έσοδα περί τα 4 εκατ. ευρώ στην εταιρεία μας και 50 εκατ. ευρώ στον πολυεθνικό συνεργάτη μας. Αυτά τα διαφυγόντα κέρδη, πέραν από το επιχειρηματικό πλάνο που εγκρίθηκε από την πολυεθνική, είχαν υπολογιστεί με ακρίβεια από κορυφαίους Έλληνες Ακαδημαϊκούς στον τομέα των οικονομικών, που διδάσκουν στα Πανεπιστήμια Αθηνών και Κείμπριτζ.  Καταγγείλαμε τη σύμβαση και ενημερώσαμε την μητρική εταιρεία που προσπάθησε να παρέμβει και να επιλύσει την διαφορά. Ωστόσο οι ντόπιοι συνεργάτες της δεν επέτρεψαν την συνέχιση της συνεργασίας και ισχυρίστηκαν ότι δεν έκαναν τίποτα το μεμπτό...,ισχυριζόμενοι ότι όλες οι «ατυχίες» σε πολύ κρίσιμα σημεία της συνεργασίας ήταν συμπωματικές.  
Το αποτέλεσμα ήταν να χαθούν περί τις 30 θέσεις εργασίας, νέων επιστημόνων, όλοι αποφοίτοι ΑΕΙ, η πλειοψηφία με μεταπτυχιακά, και κορυφαίων στον τομέα τους. Ετσι, μια δυναμική ελληνική εταιρεία που υπερδιπλασίαζε τον τζίρο της κάθε χρόνο και είχε σημαντικές αναπτυξιακές προοπτικές (ενδεικτικά: κάθε χρόνο προσέθετε περίπου 15 νέες θέσεις εργασίας) βρέθηκε να αντιμετωπίζει προβλήματα. 
Μας πήρε πάνω από τέσσερα χρόνια και πέντε διαφορετικές εταιρείες δικηγόρων για να ερευνήσουμε την υπόθεση στην Ελλάδα και στις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες για να αποδείξουμε ότι όχι μόνο τυχαία δεν ήταν όσα έγινα αλλά ήταν και παράνομα και τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2014 καταθέσαμε και κοινοποιήσαμε την αγωγή μας.



Γιατί χρειαζόμαστε τόσα πολλά χρήματα;
Η εξέταση των αστικών υποθέσεων στα ελληνικά δικαστήρια γίνεται με την κατάθεση παράβολου ύψους 0,8% επί του ύψους της απαίτησης και επιπρόσθετες συνεισφορές, χαρτόσημα κλπ. σε διάφορα Ταμεία του Δημοσίου: στη δική μας περίπτωση το ποσό αυτό έχει υπολογιστεί σις  108.859,30 Ευρώ.
Επίσης υπάρχουν πρόσθετα νομικά και διαχειριστικά έξοδα και παράβολα, π.χ. τα έξοδα των πραγματογνωμόνων, το κόστος των ένορκων καταθέσεων παρουσία συμβολαιογράφου (ορισμένες καταθέσεις θα γίνουν στις ΗΠΑ και το Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο). 
Το διαχειριστικό κόστος του indiegogo και της εκκαθάρισης των πληρωμών από πιστωτικές κάρτες κλπ. είναι μεταξύ 8% και 14% του συνόλου των χρημάτων αναλόγως του άν θα πετύχουμε τον στόχο μας, τύπο πληρωμής κλπ. 
Ευτυχώς, οι δικηγόροι μας έχουν πάρει την υπόθεση εργολαβικά με ποσοστό. Όμως η νομική μας ομάδα δεν έχει τα κεφάλαια για να χρηματοδοτήσει μια τόσο μεγάλη υπόθεση.
Προσπαθήσαμε να βρούμε χρηματοδότηση από εταιρείες που επενδύουν σε δικαστικές υποθέσεις στην Μεγάλη Βρετανία και τις ΗΠΑ, αλλά σύντομα καταλάβαμε ότι, παρά το δίκιο μας, κανένας ξένος δεν πρόκειται να επενδύσει σε μια νομική υπόθεση στην Ελλάδα, δεδομένης της δυσφήμησης για την διαφθορά και την έλλειψη διαφάνειας στην χώρα, μην εμπιστευόμενοι το νομικό μας σύστημα. Εμείς, αντίθετα, πιστεύουμε στην ελληνική Δικαιοσύνη. 



Τι πιθανότητες έχουμε για να νικήσουμε;
Σε ό,τι μας αφορά είμαστε πεπεισμένοι ότι οι ενέργειες των κατηγορουμένων ήταν παράνομες. Φυσικά, αυτό θα το αποφασίσει η Ελληνική Δικαιοσύνη. Οι ζημιές μας έχουν υπολογιστεί με μεγάλη ακρίβεια από κορυφαίους Ελληνες Ακαδημαϊκούς στον τομέα των Οικονομικών στα Πανεπιστήμια της Αθήνας και του Κείμπριτζ. Δεδομένης της σοβαρότητας και της βαρύτητας της υπόθεσης, η Ελληνική Δικαιοσύνη δέχτηκε το αίτημά μας για κατά προτίμηση εκδίκαση της αγωγής, έτσι λάβαμε δικάσιμο σε 6 μήνες (αντί 2-3 ετών): αυτό συμβαίνει πολύ σπάνια, και μας κάνει ιδιαίτερα αισιόδοξους για τον αγώνα μας. Επιπρόσθετα οφέλη των εκδικάσεων κατά προτίμηση είναι ότι σπάνια (ως ποτέ) αναβάλλονται οι δίκες, ενώ η απόφαση ανακοινώνεται 2-3 μήνες μετά την εκδίκαση. Συνεπώς, καλώς εχόντων των πραγμάτων, θα έχουμε την απόφαση τον Ιούνιο του 2015. 



Τι θα συμβεί αν νικήσουμε;
Θα γίνουν οι παρακάτω ενέργειες:

Θα επιστραφούν στους λογαριασμούς σας τα χρήματα που καταθέσατε για να στηρίξετε αυτή την προσπάθεια (το indiegogo υποστηρίζει αυτή τη δυνατότητα)


Θα πληρωθούν όλες οι οφειλές της εταιρείας στον Ελληνικό Δημόσιο και στους συνεργάτες της.


Θα κλείσει η εταιρεία και να επικεντρωθώ στην έρευνά μου εδώ στην Οξφόρδη για εύρεση προτύπου και την ποσοτικοποίηση της έννοιας της Διαφάνειας (δείτε εδώ)


Με το 75% του υπολοίπου της αποζημίωσης θα δημιουργηθεί μια διαχειριστική εταιρεία κεφαλαίου με έδρα την Οξφόρδη που:

 Θα βοηθά νέα παιδιά που έχουν το Σύνδρομο Άσπεργκερ (μια μορφή αυτισμού) και θα δημιουργήσει μια ετήσια, μόνιμη υποτροφία στο Κολλέγιο Έξετερ, του Πανεπιστημίου της Οξφόρδης για μεταπτυχιακούς φοιτητές που θα σπουδάζουν Φιλοσοφία και Επιστήμη Υπολογιστών. 
(Έχω διαγνωστεί, μέσω της διάγνωσης του γιου μου, και ο ίδιος με Άσπεργκερ και νοιώθω ότι αν δεν είχα τα χαρακτηριστικά τους, ιδιαίτερα την αφοσίωση, πίστη και εμμονή, δεν θα είχα περάσει ό,τι πέρασα και δεν θα έκανα ό,τι κάνω. Εδώ μπορείτε να δείτε τη συμμετοχή μου σε μια έρευνα του Πανεπιστημίου της Οξφόρδης στην λειτουργία των εγκεφάλων ανθρώπων υψηλής νοημοσύνης που έχουν Ασπεργκερ.)


Θα δώσει ένα σημαντικό ποσό για την έρευνα για την Αμυοτροφική Πλευρική Σκλήρυνση (ALS) μέσω της Ισραηλινής Ένωσης για το ALS 
(o πατέρας μου πέθανε από ALS, έχω 1 στις 6 πιθανότητες να πεθάνω από την ίδια ασθένεια – και η παρακολούθηση της προόδου των επιστημονικών ερευνών σ’ αυτόν τον τομέα είναι κάτι που με απασχολεί προσωπικά και γνωρίζω καλά). Εδώ μπορείτε να δείτε την συμμετοχή στο Ice Bucket Challenge.


Θα υποστηριχθεί η έρευνα για την Διαφάνεια και την Ευθύνη στην Ελλάδα (ΜΚΟ, πανεπιστημιακές έδρες κοκ).



Το υπόλοιπο 25% να δοθεί σε υφιστάμενη στην Ελλάδα ΜΚΟ που έχει ιδρυθεί από τον άνθρωπο που χρηματοδότησε και το δικό μας start-up και που ασχολείται με την χρηματοδότηση start-ups και νεανικής επιχειρηματικότητας, ενδεχομένως και σε συνεργασία με τον συναφή οργανισμό του Πανεπιστημίου της Οξφόρδης που διαχειρίζεται τις καινοτόμες ιδέες των φοιτητών.


Τι θα συμβεί αν χάσουμε;


Θα έχω καταστραφεί. Σε αντίθεση με άλλους επιχειρηματίες που όταν αντιμετωπίζουν προβλήματα οδεύουν στον Άρθρο 99 ή σε πτώχευση, εγώ επέλεξα να κρατήσω την εταιρεία σε λειτουργία και να φέρω ακέραια την ευθύνη για όλες τις οφειλές σε οποιονδήποτε, μέχρι της τελευταίας δραχμής. Ξέρω ότι πιάστηκα κορόιδο και θύμα απάτης, και έχω την Πίστη ότι η Δικαιοσύνη θα αποδοθεί.

Θα καταλήξω με ποινικό μητρώο και πέρα από τα βιώματα των τελευταίων πέντε ετών, θα έχει καταστραφεί και το μέλλον μου.

Θα έχω παραμείνει όμως πιστός στις αξίες μου. Αυτή είναι η πρώτη καμπάνια crowdsourcing για έναν τέτοιο σκοπό στην Ελλάδα. Ο συγχωρεμένος ο πατέρας μου, είχε κάνει, σαράντα χρόνια πριν, την πρώτη απεργία πείνας στην Ελλάδα, αγωνιζόμενος για καλύτερη Παιδεία. Έχω μεγαλώσει με αυτές τις αξίες (εδώ μπορείτε να τον δείτε με την Μελίνα Μερκούρη, ή εδώ μια οικογενειακή φωτογραφία μας που έγινε πρωτοσέλιδο (τότε ήμουν 6 ετών) ή να παρακολουθήσετε το μέρος του Ντοκιμαντέρ «Μαρτυρίες» όπου μιλάει για τον αγώνα του). Ο αγώνας του πατέρα μου δικαιώθηκε, και κατέληξε να γίνει ο μακροβιότερος Γενικός Γραμματέας της Διδασκαλικής Ομοσπονδίας, μετά Σχολικός Σύμβουλος ενώ μετά την συνταξιοδότηση του, ασχολήθηκε με τον Δήμο της Νίκαιας, που και υπηρέτησε ως Πρόεδρος του Δημοτικού Συμβουλίου, μέχρι την διάγνωση της ασθένειάς του.

Θα έχω αφήσει μια καλή παρακαταθήκη στα δικά μου παιδιά. Να αγωνίζονται για το τι είναι σωστό... Για Ρεαλισμό, για το Δίκαιο και την Αλήθεια όπως έλεγε κι ο παππούς τους στο ντοκιμαντέρ.

Από τα παραπάνω αντιλαμβάνεστε ότι δεν θα ζητούσα δημόσια να βάλει κάποιος ούτε δραχμή για κάτι το οποίο δεν πίστευα ο ίδιος προσωπικά. Αυτό είναι κάτι απολύτως προσωπικό που όμως έχει και δημόσιες προεκτάσεις. 


Τι θα συμβεί χάσουμε-κερδίσουμε;


Πάνω από 85% των χρημάτων σας θα καταλήξει στο Ελληνικό Δημόσιο (που έχει ανάγκη τη συνεισφορά μας).


Θα λάβετε αναλυτικά στοιχεία για το πού ακριβώς πήγαν τα χρήματά σας μέχρι το τελευταίο Ευρώ, την πρόοδο της εκστρατείας και την κατάληξη της υπόθεσης. Για παράδειγμα θα δείτε πώς μας αντιμετώπισαν τα Μέσα Μαζικής Ενημέρωσης που θα ζητήσουμε να μας στηρίξουν αυτή μας την προσπάθεια.
Θα λαμβάνετε ετήσια αναφορά από γραφείο ορκωτών λογιστών για το πώς αξιοποιήθηκαν τα χρήματά σας, ιδίως πώς βοήθησαν στους ερευνητικούς σκοπούς και στην δημιουργία νέων θέσεων εργασίας.


Σκέφτομαι να εκδώσω και να διανείμω ηλεκτρονικά ένα βιβλίο που έγραψα με τις εμπειρίες μου. Όταν έφτασα εδώ, τον Ιούνιο του 2012, δεν γνώριζα αν και πότε θα ξαναδώ τα παιδιά μου (τότε ο γιός μου ήταν 8 ετών και η κόρη μου ήταν 5 ετών). Τελικά τα ξαναείδα μετά από δύο χρόνια τον Σεπτέμβριο του 2014 που κατέβηκα στην Ελλάδα για την κατάθεση της αγωγής. Στο ενδιάμεσο διάστημα, έγραψα κι ένα βιβλίο με τις εμπειρίες και τη ζωή μου, ώστε κάποια στιγμή, να γνωρίσουν πώς πραγματικά ήταν ο ""απών"" πατέρας τους.


Μπορείτε να φανταστείτε τι καλό θα γίνει όταν θα δικαιωθούμε;
Μέσα απο την δική μας δικαίωση, θα υποστηριχθούν συνανθρώποι που έχουν σύνδρομο Άσπεργκερ, η έρευνα για το ALS και ταυτόχρονα η έρευνα για την ποσοτικοποίηση της Διαφάνειας (που και η ίδια αυτή πολυεθνική έχει ανάγκη, γιατί αν υπήρχε δεν θα κάναν τα στελέχη της αυτά που έκαναν) σε κορυφαία πανεπιστημιακά ιδρύματα. Επίσης, νέοι επιχειρηματίες θα αποκτήσουν πρόσβαση σε χρηματοδότηση και καθοδήγηση για τα δικά τους start ups και θα δημιουργηθούν δεκάδες θέσεις εργασίας!Είναι μια ευγενής προσπάθεια.

Ποιόν υποστηρίζουμε με την συνεισφορά μας;
Ένα πρόσωπο που σας υποστήριξε, ακόμη και εν αγνοία σας, και σας έδωσε (και συνεχίζει να δίνει) την δική του ελεημοσύνη σε άλλους, στο μέτρο της γνώσης και των δυνατοτήτων του. Όχι αυτή δεν είναι μια τραβηγμένη αυτοαναφορική περιγραφή μου – αφορά όλους μας – γι’ αυτό είμαστε άνθρωποι. 
Σχετικά με μένα, δεν αναφέρομαι στις 3 λίρες που έδωσα στην Βικιπεδία ή τις 5 λίρες που έδωσα τις προάλλες σε μια κοπέλα εδώ που επειδή βοηθήθηκε από έναν άστεγο θέλησε να του βρει σπίτι.  Σε  ότι με αφορά, αν υπάρχει κάποια αξία, είναι στο ότι πέρασα τη ζωή μου ασχολούμενος με καινοτομίες που οι περισσότεροι συνάνθρωποί μου, αδυνατούσαν καν να αξιολογήσουν, όσο έκανα ό,τι έκανα. 
Να μερικά λινκς για να με γνωρίσετε καλύτερα.
Εδώ μπορείτε να δείτε το προφίλ μου στο Linkedin.
Σ’ αυτή την παρουσίαση μπορείτε να δείτε τι έκανα για την πρόοδο του Ιντερνέτ στην Ελλάδα π.χ. από την πρώτη σελίδα ραδιοφωνικού σταθμού (ΣΚΑΙ) που έδινε ειδήσεις κάθε μισή ώρα στο Ιντερνέτ το 1995 (το είχα υλοποιήσει δωρεάν πήγα και τους βρήκα και τους είπα θέλω να κάνουμε αυτό κι αυτό για τους φίλους μου στο εξωτερικό και την Διασπορά εν γένει), το πρώτο ελληνικό δισκοπωλείο On-line (music.gr), το πρώτο ενημερωτικό newsletter (όταν ήμουν στην Ναυτεμπορική), μέχρι το πρώτο ελληνικό ειδησεογραφικό πόρταλ (που έκανα την τεχνική επιμέλεια της μελέτης του Σ.Α. Χρυσαφόπουλου, που δόθηκε στον Χρήστο Λαμπράκη και δύο χρόνια μετά είχαμε το in.gr), τον πρώτο αυτόματο ελληνικό-αγγλικό-γαλλικό μεταφραστή που έκανε την εμφάνισή του στο ελληνικό διαδίκτυο, τις πρώτες διαφημίσεις της google στην Ελλάδα (στην ιστοσελίδα του Ολυμπιακού πειραματιστήκαμε) και πολλά άλλα.
Σ’ αυτό εδώ το έγγραφο μπορείτε να δείτε μια συστατική επιστολή από τον μέντορά μου την εποχή που εργαζόμουν για την Ford Μotor Company (χάρις στην οποία σπούδασα). Αφορούσε την αίτηση μου για μια υποτροφία από τον Σύλλογο Φίλων Μουσικής – που μου χορήγησε ο Σύλλογος με Πρόεδρο τον Χρήστο Λαμπράκη. Σίγουρα θα βοηθήσει να καταλάβετε ποιόν βοηθάτε.

Γιατί να βοηθήσουμε έναν φοιτητή-ερευνητή στην Οξφόρδη;
Μετά τις επιχειρηματικές ατυχίες και έχοντας διαπιστώσει την περιορισμένη συνεργασία των επιστημονικών ομάδων που ασχολούνται με την ανακάλυψη των αιτιών ή φαρμάκων των ασθενειών όπως του πατέρα μου, σκέφτηκα ότι κάτι πρέπει να κάνω γι αυτό. Δηλαδή για να περιοριστεί θεσμικά η διαφθορά, να μην τύχει σε κανέναν αυτιστικό αυτό που έτυχε σε μένα, και ταυτόχρονα να επιταχυνθεί η ασφαλής διάδοση ιδεών μεταξύ ερευνητικών ομάδων. Κατόπιν συζητήσεων με φίλους Μαθηματικούς και Φιλόσοφους καταλήξαμε ότι αν καταφέρναμε να φτιάξουμε ένα μοντέλο που θα βοηθούσε στην ποσοτικοποίηση της Διαφάνειας, ίσως να δίναμε λύση και στα δύο προβλήματα. Όσο πέρναγε ο καιρός άρχισαν να αποκρυσταλλώνονται οι σκέψεις μου και σε συνεργασία με τους μέντορές μου -που συμμετέχουν σε ορισμένα από τα κορυφαία think tanks του κόσμου- σκεφτόμασταν πως κάτι τέτοιο μπορεί να τρέξει (αυτά συνέβαιναν ενώ επέβλεπα την κατάρρευση του start-up και φρόντιζα τον μελλοθάνατο πατέρα μου). Μου έγιναν διάφορες προτάσεις να εκπονήσω την έρευνά μου σε διάφορα ινστιτούτα και χώρες όμως εγώ προτιμούσα την Αγγλία. Όχι για κανέναν άλλον λόγο αλλά γιατί όλη η μέχρι τώρα πανεπιστημιακή μου παιδεία οφείλεται στο εκπαιδευτικό σύστημα της Μεγάλης Βρετανίας (είχα έρθει εδώ από 17 ετών και έχω ήδη έναν προπτυχιακό και δύο μεταπτυχιακούς τίτλους). Έτσι, έλεγα, ότι αν αυτό που θα κάνουμε θα έχει αξία, θέλω αυτή η αξία ν’ ανήκει, πρωτίστως, σ’ αυτή τη χώρα. Μάλιστα, αρχικά ήθελα να δουλέψω την έρευνα στο πρώτο μου Πανεπιστήμιο,στο Μάντσεστερ. Έτσι, πήγα στο Μάντσεστερ να δω τον καθηγητή που επηρέασε πολύ τη σκέψη μου όντας προπτυχιακός, και του παρουσιάσαμε -μαζί με τον μέντορά μου- την ιδέα. Αφού συζητήσαμε για ώρες, αφού κοιμηθήκαμε με τις ιδέες που πέσαν στον τραπέζι, την επόμενη μέρα ο καθηγητής μου, πρότεινε ότι το καλύτερο μέρος στον κόσμο για την έρευνά μου είναι το Πανεπιστήμιο της Οξφόρδης, καθότι πολλά από τα στοιχεία που θα μου χρειάζονταν, έχουν εφευρεθεί εδώ. Και έτσι βρέθηκα εδώ με τις συστατικές του Steve Furber (του αρχιτέκτονα των επεξεργαστών ARM που βρίσκονται σε πάνω από 90% των κινητών τηλεφώνων/tablets κλπ.) και του Jim Dewar (του οποίου οι θεωρίες βοηθούν στην πρόβλεψη του μακρινού μέλλοντος).  Τα πεδίο της έρευνάς μου φυσικά είναι τεράστιο, όμως στην πορεία έχω καταφέρει να βγάλω κάποια ενδιάμεσα προϊόντα. Δυστυχώς και αυτά τα προϊόντα είναι λίγο πιο μπροστά από την εποχή τους ενώ τον λίγο χρόνο που έχω για «επιχειρηματικά θέματα» τον αφιερώνω για την πρόοδο της αγωγής.  Έτσι δεν έχω καταφέρει ακόμη να βγάλω χρήματα και άρα το crowdfunding είναι μονόδρομος. 

Γνωρίζω καλά τα στερεότυπα που υπάρχουν στην πατρίδα μας για διάσημα πανεπιστήμια όπως η Οξφόρδη. Και ίσως να σας ξενίζει το πώς κάποιος που είναι εδώ ζητάει τα δικά σας χρήματα ενώ έχετε να πληρώσετε τόσα και τόσα. Να έχετε υπόψη σας πάντως ότι η Οξφόρδη είναι ένα σύγχρονο Άγιο Όρος. Η συνάφεια μεγάλη, γιατί και τα Κολλέγια μας εδώ είναι Μοναστήρια, και άλλωστε ιδρύθηκε με το Άγιο Όρος ως πρότυπο. Για τους περισσότερους από εμάς είναι απλά ένα πολύ απαιτητικό μοναστήρι. Ναι, υπάρχουν και φοιτητές (ή καθηγητές) με αριστοκρατικές καταβολές, όμως δεν είναι αυτό που ίσως έχετε στο νου σας από τα διαφημιστικά. Για μένα απλά είναι το κλείσιμο ενός κύκλου που ξεκίνησε στο Άγιο Όρος όταν πήγα 15 ετών για να επιλύσω διάφορες αναζητήσεις μου (ναι, συναντήθηκα και με τον Παΐσιο, ο οποίος και αγιοποιήθηκε τις προάλλες σε μια ημέρα σημαντική για μένα). Η Οξφόρδη είναι ένα ιερό μέρος και όπως όλα τα ιερά είναι all things to all people. Ο καθένας βρίσκει και παίρνει ότι του αξίζει. Ξέρω ότι κινδυνεύω να γίνω πολύ μελό άρα περισσότερα στο βιβλίο που ίσως κάποτε εκδώσω. 




Γιατί στο indiegogo;

Πρώτα προσπάθησαμε να τρέξει αυτή η προσπάθεια στην ελληνική ιστοσελίδα με αντίστοιχο σκοπό supergiftme. Όμως ενημερώθηκα από τον παλαιό φίλο και συνεργάτη Χάρη Καρώνη (που τρέχει μια από τις καλύτερες και πλέον καινοτόμες εταιρείες Ιντερνετ στην Ελλάδα, τη Viva) ότι δυστυχώς η Ελληνική Νομοθεσία δεν προβλέπει δωρεές μέσω Ιντερνέτ για ποσά που υπερβαίνουν τις 2500 ευρώ. Συνεπώς ήταν επιβεβλημένη αυτή η λύση. 
Η indiegogo παρείχε άμεση υποστήριξη ενώ από πίσω της βρίσκονται επενδυτές όπως ο Sir Richard Branson (ο πλέον αγαπημένος μου Βρεττανός επιχειρηματίας, μετά τον Sir Clive Sinclair) και έτσι βρεθήκαμε εδώ. Θέλω να πω είναι μια ιδιαίτερα σοβαρή και ασφαλής πλατφόρμα.
Θα ήταν ωφέλιμο αν αυτή η προσπάθεια μπορεί να αποτελέσει ένα επιπλέον κίνητρο για την άρση αυτού του περιορισμού στην Ελλάδα, που έχει αρνητικές συνέπειες τόσο σε ανθρώπους που προσπαθούν να βρουν χρήματα όσο και στις ελληνικές εταιρείες που δημιουργούν και υποστηρίζουν τέτοιες καινοτόμες πλατφόρμες, ιδιαίτερα σε μια φάση που δεν υπάρχουν εξελληνισμένες σελίδες (δηλαδή που θα μπορούσαν να κάνουν καλές δουλειές).  


Αν έχετε διάφορες ερωτήσεις αναφορικά με μένα και την προσπάθεια παρακαλώ μην διστάσετε να επικοινωνήσετε μαζί μου και θα φροντίσω να απαντήσω εδώ ώστε να βοηθηθούν και άλλοι που έχουν παρόμοιες σκέψεις.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","The Head Over Heels Story

My name is Jessica Edwards. I live in Polson, Montana, a small town on the Flathead Reservation with about 5,000 year-round residents. I started teaching gymnastics here about six years ago and have had a wildly enthusiastic response from the community. I'm the big one in this photo taken back then.



I started teaching 24 years ago when I was 16, to pay for my own classes. I was driving to Kalispell all the time because the closest gymnastics facilities are 60 miles north or south of Polson. Because of this I have students from numerous other small towns in the Mission Valley. Some kids are built for gymnastics or dance, and I love providing a place for them to discover their talents. For other kids gymnastics training develops in them coordination, strength, flexibility and confidence that will help them excel in other sports and through all of life. We have winter for a good six months here, and I value hospitality - providing a warm, dry place for physical activity and community recreation when there's not a whole lot else available! I named my business Head Over Heels, LLC, and we've been using a church fellowship hall - my husband and four kids helping me set up and take down equipment each week (This is an old picture - they are harder workers now!).
Now we are finally getting our own leased facility, built to suit! Everyone in town seems to be talking about the new gym, which is supposed to be ready for action in September!


I've found awesome deals on used equipment, driven (or sent my husband to drive!) to haul it back, and filled up storage units with these treasures until we can get into the gym. 
I've also found awesome staff - energetic, creative, talented and compassionate athletes who are developing gymnastics and dance skills in their students while simultaneously developing character in them for whole-life health! These are the real treasures. 
In order to keep my prices for students accessible and be able to pay my staff adequately I am trying to raise money to purchase the last few major pieces of equipment for the new gym.

</div><h4>They said it could never be done!</h4><p>99% pure oxygen, human beings most valuable
element, in a disposable and simple easy to use
device at a price that defies logic?   Well Lifeflo<span style=""font-size: 12px;line-height: 0;vertical-align: super;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">TM </span>did it and here is how. Lifeflo OTC emergency Oxygen is based on breakthrough technologies allow us to
manufacture efficiently, cost effectively and provide the simplest, most affordable oxygen
delivery device available.  It has no electronics, no high pressure cylinders, no complicated
regulators and no maintenance requirements. 
 Once you are done using it - you
simply discard it.   </p>
<p>Providing oxygen to someone injured or
distressed while waiting for EMS services to arrive can make a positive difference
in survival (mortality) and long term effects of injury (morbidity).  We never expect accidents to occur but inevitably
they will, either directly or indirectly, impact you.  Like fire extinguishers, Epipens, smoke

Oxygen device available during a medical emergency could dramatically change your or loved ones future.</p>
<p>Another very important reason for developing this technology is
providing oxygen to those less fortunate that do not have such a basic medical
intervention readily available.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460568075/image_4a_dve0m9.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 334px;""/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We will keep this very high level but you need some background on the science of oxygenation and why you need it.  Oxygen is the miraculous element that permits life to exist and flourish on earth.  It is a simple and indisputable fact – oxygen is
necessary to sustain life.  Clinical studies
show that a human being can live for days without water, and weeks without food
– but without Oxygen biological DEATH begins to occur within 3 MINUTES.  </span><br/></p>
<p>The body’s ability to deliver
critical oxygen to vital organs during an emergency can be compromised 2 ways – circulatory
(blood flow) and respiratory (air flow) or both.  Circulatory events might be due to heart
attack, stroke, trauma, severe blood loss or electrical shock to name a
few.  Respiratory events might include
asthma, COPD, choking, drowning or paralysis as examples.  Every medical emergency can potentially
benefit from the delivery of oxygen.</p>
<p>In the United States alone there
are over 120 million 911 calls per year resulting in 12 million emergency room
visits.  In at a vast majority of those oxygen
is provided by EMS or first responders. 
With the average emergency service response time being 12-15 minutes
nationwide it would only make sense to make oxygen available wherever and
whenever it is needed - in your home or workplace.  Is this a new
concept? No.  What is new is that
Lifeflo<span style=""font-size: 12px;line-height: 0;vertical-align: super;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">TM</span> makes it affordable at $.08 per day!  A retail price of $89.99 and a shelf life of
3 years equals $.08 per day.</p>
<p>There is a little known category
that the FDA allows for Oxygen, in it’s pure medical grade form, to be sold
direct to consumers for emergency use – <b>without a prescription</b>.  It does not exempt us from the comprehensive FDA
guidelines regarding safety and usage. 
It only says that our device must deliver 6 lpm of oxygen for a minimum
of 15 minutes.  This is exactly what our

so important during an emergency why isn’t it already available?  Excellent question and the answer is quite basic – simple and affordable. 
There are several devices on the market that are able to deliver medical oxygen during an emergency by laypersons.  Unfortunately they do not meet 2
critical factors - SIMPLE and AFFORDABLE. 
Pressurized cylinders and complicated regulators don’t actually spell

currently sold for emergency use by laypersons cost well in excess of $350.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Q&amp;A </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">20 Common Questions About Emergency Oxygen</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p><b>1.)
Why is supplemental oxygen so important during a medical emergency? </b>Life-threatening
medical emergencies are usually accompanied by low tissue oxygen levels (not
enough oxygen to tissue and organs). If this progresses, the brain will begin
to die first, with other organs following. Additionally, low oxygen levels to
the heart may lead to cardiac arrest. After AIRWAY, supplemental oxygen is the
most important first step in treatment. </p>
<p><b>2.)
Who should receive emergency medical oxygen? </b>ANY victim of a potentially
life-threatening illness or injury – without exception. </p>
<p><b>3.)
How is emergency oxygen employed? </b>For the victim who is breathing,
emergency oxygen via a mask increases the oxygen concentration of the inhaled
air. For the victim who requires rescue breathing, emergency oxygen fed into a
CPR mask enriches the oxygen concentration of the breath being blown into the
victim by the rescuer. In either case, the amount of oxygen available to the
victim is greatly increased. </p>
<p><b>4.)
When should emergency oxygen be started? </b>Oxygen should be started
IMMEDIATELY AFTER a clear and open AIRWAY is established. However, if there is
a delay retrieving the oxygen unit and CPR is required, conventional
mouth-to-mouth (or mouth-to-barrier) rescue breathing should be performed until
the oxygen unit is available<b>. </b></p>
<p><b>5.)
Can oxygen ever be harmful during a medical emergency? </b>Oxygen is
NEVER harmful during a medical emergency. It increases the likelihood of a
better outcome for the victim. The potential harmful effects of oxygen occur
after prolonged use (more than 5 hours). The medical literature and
publications now state that oxygen DOES NOT suppress respiratory drive (in
COPD), and is important to almost all victims of sudden life-threatening
illness or injury. </p>
<p><b>6.)
Will emergency oxygen substitute for rescue breathing? </b>NO! In
the non-breathing victim, application of oxygen without rescue breathing will
not benefit the victim. It must be coupled to the rescue breathing via a CPR
mask. </p>
<p><b>7.)
Is oxygen still needed after the arrest victim revives from CPR?/AED? </b>YES!
Oxygen should be continued until the EMS arrives. Maintaining oxygen on the
revived victim may prevent relapse into cardio-respiratory arrest. </p>
<p><b>8.)
Is oxygen still needed after the victim who is breathing improves or
“recovers”? </b>Yes,
Oxygen should be continued until the EMS arrives. Maintaining oxygen on the
apparently improved or recovered victim may prevent lapse into
cardio-respiratory arrest. </p>
<p><b>9.)
Will emergency oxygen substitute for the Heimlich Maneuver ? </b>No. The
airway must be cleared of the obstructing food or object. Oxygen alone will not
help the victim. Once the obstruction is cleared (A=AIRWAY), oxygen should be
applied to aid in recovery. </p>
<p><b>10.)
If I am not sure whether the victim is breathing, should I perform rescue
breathing or should I put the oxygen mask on the victim and wait and see what
happens? </b>If
it is unclear whether or not the victim is breathing, start rescue breathing
(preferably with emergency oxy-gen). By responding in this manner, you will not
harm the person if he/she is breathing. Do not just put the oxygen mask on and
“wait and see”. If they are not breathing or breathing inadequately they may
deteriorate to full arrest without rescue breathing. </p>
<p><b>11.)
If the victim has not had a respiratory or cardiac arrest but appears to have
difficulty breathing, should I apply emergency oxygen? </b>YES. If
the victim has labored breathing, applying emergency oxygen is one of the most
important responses you can make to potentially prevent an arrest. </p>
<p><b>12.)
If the victim cannot tolera</b><b>te </b><b>the
oxygen mask on his/her face, what should I do? </b>Hold the
mask just adjacent to the face. Most of the oxygen will still get into the
victim’s mouth and nose. </p>
<p><b>13.)
Does emergency oxygen require a doctor's prescription? </b>NO.
Oxygen is a drug when it is given in concentrations beyond what is in ambient
air and when used for medical treatment. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulating government agency for medical
oxygen, requires a prescription, but has EXEMPTED this requirement for
emergency applications. For all other medical applications, Rx Only”. In order
to be considered as an over-the-counter (OTC) device, i.e., “non-prescription”,
the oxygen delivery system must provide a minimum flow rate of 6 liters per
minute for a minimum of 15 minutes. </p>
<p><b>14.)
Who can provide emergency oxygen? </b>Anyone properly instructed in its use.  Providers should be familiar with the
manufacturer’s directions and instructional materials. A course in first aid
oxygen administration is encouraged. </p>
<p><b>15.)
What are the legal requirements for maintaining a LifefloTM OTC emergency
oxygen unit? </b>Unlike
oxygen cylinders Lifeflo<sup>TM</sup> OTC Emergency Oxygen units require no
ongoing maintenance or recertification.  When
the expiration date is reached discard per the instructions provided with your device.</p>
<p><b>16.)
Is oxygen dangerous? Can't it catch fire and explode? </b>Oxygen
does not “catch fire” or explode. It supports and accelerates existing
combustion. It is contained in a protective bag while being generated with
safety features built-in. Oxygen is perfectly safe when properly handled and
used for life saving. </p>
<p><b>17.)
How much oxygen should I have on-hand? </b>A good rule of thumb is to
determine what the average EMS response time is to your facility and have enough
to last twice as long as the response time. In most circumstances, a 30 to 45
minute supply is sufficient. </p>
<p><b>18.)
Does OSHA have any specific regulations regarding emergency oxygen? </b>NO. There
are no special instructions or record keeping required. </p>
<p><b>19.)
Is oxygen covered under the Good Samaritan laws? </b>Yes,
emergency oxygen administration is considered first aid and is therefore
covered under the Good Samaritan Laws. </p>
<p><b>20.)
If I am not sure whether to give emergency oxygen, what should I do? </b>GIVE IT!
It is far better to over-use it than to under-use it and miss an opportunity.

</div></div>","They said it could never be done!99% pure oxygen, human beings most valuable
element, in a disposable and simple easy to use
device at a price that defies logic?   Well LifefloTM did it and here is how. Lifeflo OTC emergency Oxygen is based on breakthrough technologies allow us to
manufacture efficiently, cost effectively and provide the simplest, most affordable oxygen
delivery device available.  It has no electronics, no high pressure cylinders, no complicated
regulators and no maintenance requirements. 
 Once you are done using it - you
simply discard it.   
Providing oxygen to someone injured or
distressed while waiting for EMS services to arrive can make a positive difference
in survival (mortality) and long term effects of injury (morbidity).  We never expect accidents to occur but inevitably
they will, either directly or indirectly, impact you.  Like fire extinguishers, Epipens, smoke
alarms and automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) having a LifefloTM OTC Emergency
Oxygen device available during a medical emergency could dramatically change your or loved ones future.
Another very important reason for developing this technology is
providing oxygen to those less fortunate that do not have such a basic medical
intervention readily available.  We will keep this very high level but you need some background on the science of oxygenation and why you need it.  Oxygen is the miraculous element that permits life to exist and flourish on earth.  It is a simple and indisputable fact – oxygen is
necessary to sustain life.  Clinical studies
show that a human being can live for days without water, and weeks without food
– but without Oxygen biological DEATH begins to occur within 3 MINUTES.  
The body’s ability to deliver
critical oxygen to vital organs during an emergency can be compromised 2 ways – circulatory
(blood flow) and respiratory (air flow) or both.  Circulatory events might be due to heart
attack, stroke, trauma, severe blood loss or electrical shock to name a
few.  Respiratory events might include
asthma, COPD, choking, drowning or paralysis as examples.  Every medical emergency can potentially
benefit from the delivery of oxygen.
In the United States alone there
are over 120 million 911 calls per year resulting in 12 million emergency room
visits.  In at a vast majority of those oxygen
is provided by EMS or first responders. 
With the average emergency service response time being 12-15 minutes
nationwide it would only make sense to make oxygen available wherever and
whenever it is needed - in your home or workplace.  Is this a new
concept? No.  What is new is that
LifefloTM makes it affordable at $.08 per day!  A retail price of $89.99 and a shelf life of
3 years equals $.08 per day.
There is a little known category
that the FDA allows for Oxygen, in it’s pure medical grade form, to be sold
direct to consumers for emergency use – without a prescription.  It does not exempt us from the comprehensive FDA
guidelines regarding safety and usage. 
It only says that our device must deliver 6 lpm of oxygen for a minimum
of 15 minutes.  This is exactly what our
LifefloTM  OTC device is designed to do.So if oxygen is
so important during an emergency why isn’t it already available?  Excellent question and the answer is quite basic – simple and affordable. 
There are several devices on the market that are able to deliver medical oxygen during an emergency by laypersons.  Unfortunately they do not meet 2
critical factors - SIMPLE and AFFORDABLE. 
Pressurized cylinders and complicated regulators don’t actually spell
SIMPLE.  Also, many of the oxygen devices
currently sold for emergency use by laypersons cost well in excess of $350.

Lifeflo’s design combines several technological breakthroughs, central of which are
the unique chemistry of the materials used to produce the oxygen.  Furthermore the design breakthroughs allow
for simplified shipping and storage until needed.  All totaled the world has not seen a quantum
leap in an oxygen producing device when all is considered – simplicity and affordability.  Simply pour stored water into the Oxygen Generation Bag, attach
dosing cap, press and begin making oxygen instantly!





“There is no medical emergency that cannot benefit from the delivery of oxygen... I have never seen a device so simple in both its design and operation yet so impactful.” LifefloTM Oxygen Generation Technology (OGT) has
been in development since 2007.  Initial
funding for the technology was under a DOD Naval Research grant.  The challenge of providing potentially lifesaving
oxygen to injured soldiers involved strapping a heavy pressurized cylinder to the
backs of medics and then dodging bullets. 
Needless to say it was not done very often.  The military recognizes the importance of
delivering oxygen at the point of injury and is still searching for solutions.

After the
initial efforts to produce a device suitable for military purposes the
technology began the long journey to where it is now.  Input came from prominent emergency room
physicians, former NASA jet propulsion scientists, professors of Chemistry and
thought leaders in the field of respiratory medicine.  It has not been an easy path but the core
investors and founders have such a strong belief in the technologies ability to
change the world they continued to keep the project alive. 
The product
has gone from a very simple concept to a very difficult and expensive to build
device and back to a very simple device. 
Don’t let the simplicity fool you in to thinking it is not
technical.  To the contrary some of the
most significant “simple” devices in fact utilize some very sophisticated
science like a recently released $9.00 computer.  The LifefloTM Oxygen Generation Technology is
simple in its design for a very good reason – in many instances it will be used
when emotions and tensions are high.   
Q&A 
20 Common Questions About Emergency Oxygen

1.)
Why is supplemental oxygen so important during a medical emergency? Life-threatening
medical emergencies are usually accompanied by low tissue oxygen levels (not
enough oxygen to tissue and organs). If this progresses, the brain will begin
to die first, with other organs following. Additionally, low oxygen levels to
the heart may lead to cardiac arrest. After AIRWAY, supplemental oxygen is the
most important first step in treatment. 
2.)
Who should receive emergency medical oxygen? ANY victim of a potentially
life-threatening illness or injury – without exception. 
3.)
How is emergency oxygen employed? For the victim who is breathing,
emergency oxygen via a mask increases the oxygen concentration of the inhaled
air. For the victim who requires rescue breathing, emergency oxygen fed into a
CPR mask enriches the oxygen concentration of the breath being blown into the
victim by the rescuer. In either case, the amount of oxygen available to the
victim is greatly increased. 
4.)
When should emergency oxygen be started? Oxygen should be started
IMMEDIATELY AFTER a clear and open AIRWAY is established. However, if there is
a delay retrieving the oxygen unit and CPR is required, conventional
mouth-to-mouth (or mouth-to-barrier) rescue breathing should be performed until
the oxygen unit is available. 
5.)
Can oxygen ever be harmful during a medical emergency? Oxygen is
NEVER harmful during a medical emergency. It increases the likelihood of a
better outcome for the victim. The potential harmful effects of oxygen occur
after prolonged use (more than 5 hours). The medical literature and
publications now state that oxygen DOES NOT suppress respiratory drive (in
COPD), and is important to almost all victims of sudden life-threatening
illness or injury. 
6.)
Will emergency oxygen substitute for rescue breathing? NO! In
the non-breathing victim, application of oxygen without rescue breathing will
not benefit the victim. It must be coupled to the rescue breathing via a CPR
mask. 
7.)
Is oxygen still needed after the arrest victim revives from CPR?/AED? YES!
Oxygen should be continued until the EMS arrives. Maintaining oxygen on the
revived victim may prevent relapse into cardio-respiratory arrest. 
8.)
Is oxygen still needed after the victim who is breathing improves or
“recovers”? Yes,
Oxygen should be continued until the EMS arrives. Maintaining oxygen on the
apparently improved or recovered victim may prevent lapse into
cardio-respiratory arrest. 
9.)
Will emergency oxygen substitute for the Heimlich Maneuver ? No. The
airway must be cleared of the obstructing food or object. Oxygen alone will not
help the victim. Once the obstruction is cleared (A=AIRWAY), oxygen should be
applied to aid in recovery. 
10.)
If I am not sure whether the victim is breathing, should I perform rescue
breathing or should I put the oxygen mask on the victim and wait and see what
happens? If
it is unclear whether or not the victim is breathing, start rescue breathing
(preferably with emergency oxy-gen). By responding in this manner, you will not
harm the person if he/she is breathing. Do not just put the oxygen mask on and
“wait and see”. If they are not breathing or breathing inadequately they may
deteriorate to full arrest without rescue breathing. 
11.)
If the victim has not had a respiratory or cardiac arrest but appears to have
difficulty breathing, should I apply emergency oxygen? YES. If
the victim has labored breathing, applying emergency oxygen is one of the most
important responses you can make to potentially prevent an arrest. 
12.)
If the victim cannot tolerate the
oxygen mask on his/her face, what should I do? Hold the
mask just adjacent to the face. Most of the oxygen will still get into the
victim’s mouth and nose. 
13.)
Does emergency oxygen require a doctor's prescription? NO.
Oxygen is a drug when it is given in concentrations beyond what is in ambient
air and when used for medical treatment. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the regulating government agency for medical
oxygen, requires a prescription, but has EXEMPTED this requirement for
emergency applications. For all other medical applications, Rx Only”. In order
to be considered as an over-the-counter (OTC) device, i.e., “non-prescription”,
the oxygen delivery system must provide a minimum flow rate of 6 liters per
minute for a minimum of 15 minutes. 
14.)
Who can provide emergency oxygen? Anyone properly instructed in its use.  Providers should be familiar with the
manufacturer’s directions and instructional materials. A course in first aid
oxygen administration is encouraged. 
15.)
What are the legal requirements for maintaining a LifefloTM OTC emergency
oxygen unit? Unlike
oxygen cylinders LifefloTM OTC Emergency Oxygen units require no
ongoing maintenance or recertification.  When
the expiration date is reached discard per the instructions provided with your device.
16.)
Is oxygen dangerous? Can't it catch fire and explode? Oxygen
does not “catch fire” or explode. It supports and accelerates existing
combustion. It is contained in a protective bag while being generated with
safety features built-in. Oxygen is perfectly safe when properly handled and
used for life saving. 
17.)
How much oxygen should I have on-hand? A good rule of thumb is to
determine what the average EMS response time is to your facility and have enough
to last twice as long as the response time. In most circumstances, a 30 to 45
minute supply is sufficient. 
18.)
Does OSHA have any specific regulations regarding emergency oxygen? NO. There
are no special instructions or record keeping required. 
19.)
Is oxygen covered under the Good Samaritan laws? Yes,
emergency oxygen administration is considered first aid and is therefore
covered under the Good Samaritan Laws. 
20.)
If I am not sure whether to give emergency oxygen, what should I do? GIVE IT!
It is far better to over-use it than to under-use it and miss an opportunity.
Remember, it is not harmful and my save a life and/or a brain!

Attend trade shows around the country for E.M.S., Hospital, Nursing Homes, and Funeral Homes. Publication marketing to educate our markets on PLAD's product offerings.
Finish prototyping our expandable Pro-Lift that will fit around hospital beds. 

Compact, Lightweight, and Portable



Crafted from aircraft grade aluminum, the Pro-Lift LX has a lifting capacity of 500 lbs. while maintaining a compact and lightweight design, and industry first.


Multiple Harness Configurations

Our swing harness can be used in conjunction with our back harness to comfortably and safely lift a patient into a seated position then lowered into a chair or wheelchair.
Backboard Harness System

The backboard harness system allows a single operator to lift a patient on a backboard with just the pull of a trigger.  The Pro-Lift LX accommodates the industry leading stretchers which allows the operator to safely lower the patient directly onto a stretcher.

Variable speed lithium ion Smart Controller with load indicator and battery status.
 
Multi-position deployment to fitdiverse lifting situations.


 
 
 



 



Comfortable patient handles givesthe patient a sense of securitywhile being lifted.

The Impact of Your Contribution Most of us have a friend or family member in the health care and E.M.S. field.  Our product will directly impact them by creating a safe work environment and greatly cut down on injuries from patient lifting.  Back injuries in these fields cost in the billions of dollars yearly which impacts each and every one of us indirectly.  We want to bring the dollar amount down while saving backs, one lift at a time!

    Other Ways to Contribute We understand that some of you are unable to monetarily contribute, and we completely understand.  We would be flattered if you shared our mission with your friends and on your social media accounts.  This will go a long way in informing others that may have the potential of injuring themselves while performing non-emergent lift assists!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign
