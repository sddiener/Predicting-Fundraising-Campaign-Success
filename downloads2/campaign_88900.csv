This technology enlarges the screen by projecting a glow of light from all four sides of the back of the screen onto the surrounding surface.Most smartphones today offer light notifications, so when you get a new message or an incoming call, a colorful LED will start blinking. However, LED notifications can be too subtle to notice. Look how we solved that problem!Compare the difference - This shows how AmbiVision can extend your screen. During dark to bright scene changes, the pupil of the eye reacts by decreasing its diameter twice within 5 seconds. When the scene changes from bright to dark, your pupil needs to increase its diameter for up to 180 seconds for clearer vision in the dark. In every movie, scenes switch from dark to bright hundreds of times, creating constant tension in your eye muscles which can lead to vision impairment.Minimum luminosity level decreases the contrast between wall and screen content to let your eyes relax. With AmbiVision Moto, the muscles of your eyes are less strained, so your eyes don't get tired while spending long periods of time in front of the screen. Whether you prefer rock, classic, or jazz, with AmbiVision Moto, your music sounds better. Liven up your parties by making the beats match the visual effects. That’s not all. AmbiVision Moto doubles the working time of your Smartphone. Inside the Mod, we include LiPo battery, an advanced, fast-charging and managing battery IC from Texas Instruments, and a dual mode (Qi 1.2 or AirFuel) wireless power receiver/transmitter from STMicroelectronics.It can be used as a wireless power bank or it can be charging wirelessly (and your Smartphone if connected) .   AmbiVision Moto takes care of your Smartphone using a smart charging algorithm. Power flows between the phone battery and AmbiVision’s battery to keep it working as long as possible.AmbiVision Moto is designed to be an extension of your phone, rather than being a separate, bulky, and unattractive device.  We offer three colors to match your phone: Black, White, and Gold. The final design can changed if the change is requested by Motorola.We used the newest 48 digital LEDs (APA102-2020 for you super techy types) on the AmbiVision Moto. It provides lightning fast data speed with excellent colors. An intuitive and powerful app allows you to manage the lights. You can turn on a specific mode manually (screen capturing, mood lamp, or music visualization) or connect a specific mode with a current working app. That means if you play a game, watch the news, or play a video, the screen capture mode is automatically activated. If you listen to music from the radio, the sound visualization mode can be activated.Thanks to our advanced software, we can capture the screen while achieving about 25-45 FPS with under 3% processor usage.With AmbiVision Moto, you can also take your notifications to a whole new level. Instead of (or in addition to) buzzing or chimed alerts, the bright LED system indicates all notifications with a wide range of colors and patterns, making your Smartphone truly unique.Any types of notifications can be completely customized.We also included infrared transmitter to use your smartphone as a remote control for most of consumer devices. We created the device in response to the “Transform the Smartphone Challenge” by Motorola. To be able to ship our product to customers, we decided to get straight to the final mod design.3D printing allows us to check the mechanical design before tooling. The hardware contains the latest technology – a very low power microcontroller, advanced LEDs, and innovative power management units.Key components. Currently the device is production-ready. We have selected electronics components and finished the firmware. Thanks to the DFU mode, when we provide a new feature, you will need to allow firmware updating. Thanks to our previous projects, we have a trusted and fast manufacturer selected. They are capable of making about 1000 devices within 2 weeks (awesome, right?).

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have quite number of risks associated in converting this prototype device into a product but none are that vital at this stage of the game. Just to mention couple, the yield loss due to nonuniform handcrafting action and high production cost for the same reason are the top ones in the list. While assembling the LED and microelectronics into this metallic body, the laser head or the legs tend to break away leaving the device dead during installation. Since it is not machine assembly, the production yield levels as well as cost may end up significantly lower. Being hand-assembled in Europe, cost factor is also high with comparable products from Asia not only due to the country of origin but also due to hand machining of the metal pieces in the body. We will be focusing on the both items to relieve the mentioned risks without sacrificing its privileged elegance and slick metallic sensation.</p>

Risks & Challenges
We have quite number of risks associated in converting this prototype device into a product but none are that vital at this stage of the game. Just to mention couple, the yield loss due to nonuniform handcrafting action and high production cost for the same reason are the top ones in the list. While assembling the LED and microelectronics into this metallic body, the laser head or the legs tend to break away leaving the device dead during installation. Since it is not machine assembly, the production yield levels as well as cost may end up significantly lower. Being hand-assembled in Europe, cost factor is also high with comparable products from Asia not only due to the country of origin but also due to hand machining of the metal pieces in the body. We will be focusing on the both items to relieve the mentioned risks without sacrificing its privileged elegance and slick metallic sensation.",4.0,0,"4 Campaigns

  The top left shows ViCase Mini with all sides and top removed. The bottom holds two 2.5"" disks and provides cable ties and space to organize all your wiring. The secret why ViCase with top cover removed looks so tidy. Above you see the Mini-ITX Motherboard. Most of the top space is taken up by the two cooler. The CPU cooler in this image is ViCase-Cooler-L. The other big cooler is for the GTX 750 Ti Graphic Card. What makes ViCase Mini significantly more quiet versus a desktop is the design approach that both cooler suck in cold air from the outside, thus less fan speed is required which in turn reduces the noise. To further reduce the noise by reducing wind speed we made the entire top and all sides one big perforated air exchanger. And the pATX power supply works without a fan too! The image to the right shows the very same ViCase with mounted sides and top cover. The top cover snaps on, so you have very fast and easy access to your PC for service or to the top cover for cleaning.

<p>
  Our story of ViCase started as a side project to ViDock: We needed a Host-PC for our Open PCIe Expansion Enclosure. But soon ViCase took on a life of itself. Michael and Tim loved the new case so much, they simply converted their own PCs to ViCase, until all our in-house computers were ViCase PCs. Even the CNC machine that cuts the ViCase prototype is driven by a ViCase PC. Every time something was not right, we designed and build a new version to fix it. Within a year we build an endless number of ViCase prototypes, slowly evolving it to a computer that is simply a joy to use.

Our non technical approach makes it easy to find your configuration, and then tune it. Please see the movie on how it works. Use the V²Configurator to configure your ViCase. How to buy ViCase with the Configurator is shown in the Movie ""Easy buy ViCase"" below.

How All-in-One Conversion works


  All-In-One Computers are elegant in their appearance. The All-In-One conversion of ViCase takes this elegance and adds to it the performance and upgradeability of the desktop. Best of all, you can convert Displays you already own into All-In-One. For more details please check out the chapter: ""3. All-In-One Converter"" in the V²Configurator

How to assemble ViCase


  After you receive the parts for your ViCase Custom PC you will assemble it. The detailed movie's instructions and the ViCase's unique design that gives you access from all sides will make the assembly process very easy.

The ViCase Story
V² Story


  Our story of ViCase started as a side project to ViDock: We needed a Host-PC for our Open PCIe Expansion Enclosure. But soon ViCase took on a life of itself. Michael and Tim loved the new case so much, they simply converted their own PCs to ViCase, until all our in-house computers were ViCase PCs. Even the CNC machine that cuts the ViCase prototype is driven by a ViCase PC. Every time something was not right, we designed and build a new version to fix it. Within a year we build an endless number of ViCase prototypes, slowly evolving it to a computer that is simply a joy to use.

V² Team

We all come from the ViDock Community with a love for small and quiet computer systems that pack a punch. Together we have over 150 Years in Computer experience. Some of us are working together for over a decade. We all wish you as much joy using ViCase as we had in developing it.

Perk Discount Options


  There are three Perk Discount options: Early Signature, Early Bird and Indiegogo.

Please use the Configurator to build yourself a working ViCase configuration and use the Indiegogo Checkout Button to calculate the cost of the ViCase Extras you may need for your ViCase Custom PC.

  Use the V²Configurator to check out your Perks on Indiegogo, as well as all needed parts with third party. The movie shows how.

Shipping

  Thanks to ViDock we have great experience in world wide shipping. Giving precise shipping cost for all configurations and all countries is not practical. Expect about $20 ... $30 US shipping cost. For some countries, such as in Europe, additional tax need to be paid. You can choose to pay this tax with us and we will do the complete import procedure up to your door. Once we get ready to ship we will contact you on the details.",26.0,2,"1 Campaign

While 
there are many ways to purchase a gun in the US, it’s easy to see how a 
criminal would make a purchase.  Purchasing through a licensed gun 
dealer is the most common.  This includes traditional gun dealers and 
pawn shops that are licensed to sell guns.  A private party sale is the 
next most common.  This includes buying or inheriting a gun from family 
or friends and purchasing from classified ads.  The last method is 
purchasing from a gun show.  This is often referenced as the Gun Show 
Loophole and includes both licensed gun dealers and private transactions.

stolen guns account for less than 1% of thefts. It makes sense too, as

 not a significant source, most criminals purchase their guns like the

 who use the least invasive method.  Criminals  avoid full background checks. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454107020/srk8yipjgpaeztbgex13.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454024467/nukumflcklmi3t7wqusq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454018141/vyz1ggvmn9gjxyt0rkdd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454018383/k0r2pkhew2wsbyoev118.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454018396/jb8k4hwso9ifpttscewd.png"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p>Hi, I'm Randall Gorham.  The idea behind Gun Transfer started several

Unified design. Unified placement. Unified charging. All of your wearable needs, solved. In one place.

<h3>I want to plug you into the future...but first a little about my past.</h3>
<p>I started my professional career as a Software Engineer at IBM because I was passionate about technology. I went to law school and became a prosecutor in NYC because I wanted to help people. Now I am turning my attention back to technology so I can help solve a problem we all experience -- dead battery anxiety.  </p>
<p>As a cell phone geek I have more than my share of charging cables, wall warts, docks, battery packs, battery cases and all the rest. I knew there had to be a better way. I want the Plug Pack to be the (better) way people use and charge their phone. Let's ditch the charging cables once and for all. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522107438/cnfonrikunbs2fk1m6tc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Where we're going we don't need cables.</h3>
<p>The single biggest failure point in any mobile device is the battery. When the battery dies the phone is completely useless. Do we have to carry charging cables everywhere we go? Not if you have a Plug Pack.</p>
<p>We believe the ultimate phone accessory is one that allows you to maximize the use and enjoyment you get from your phone. The Plug Pack let's you use your phone without a single cable or adapter, ever. The Plug Pack's built in AC prongs allow you to charge your phone virtually anywhere. Its built in  back-up battery allows you to charge it separately from your phone so you are never tied down by a charging cable again.Keeping your phone charged isn't the Plug Pack's only superpower, it also is an amazing way to hold and view your phone. Just plug it in above the kitchen counter, your workbench, vanity or wherever you find yourself. Our unique plug design pivots 90 degrees and gives you the ability to use and view your phone in portrait or landscape mode. Look up recipes without spilling ingredients all over your phone. Watch that YouTube tutorial without covering your phone in sawdust. Listen to the morning news or play some music in the bathroom without draining your battery or accidentally drowning your phone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522107412/ukomprz9t3cmklowuwal.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When staying charged is this easy and using your phone is more fun, you will use your phone more often -- and that is a very good thing.</p>
<h3>Help us, help you. </h3>
<p>As finalists in the Indiegogo/Motorola Transform the Smartphone Challenge we are benefiting from guidance and technical support directly from the Moto Mod team at Motorola. We are working hard, but need your help to cross the finish line. Join us and help make Plug Pack the (better) way people use and charge their phone!</p>

I started my professional career as a Software Engineer at IBM because I was passionate about technology. I went to law school and became a prosecutor in NYC because I wanted to help people. Now I am turning my attention back to technology so I can help solve a problem we all experience -- dead battery anxiety.  
As a cell phone geek I have more than my share of charging cables, wall warts, docks, battery packs, battery cases and all the rest. I knew there had to be a better way. I want the Plug Pack to be the (better) way people use and charge their phone. Let's ditch the charging cables once and for all. 

Where we're going we don't need cables.
The single biggest failure point in any mobile device is the battery. When the battery dies the phone is completely useless. Do we have to carry charging cables everywhere we go? Not if you have a Plug Pack.
We believe the ultimate phone accessory is one that allows you to maximize the use and enjoyment you get from your phone. The Plug Pack let's you use your phone without a single cable or adapter, ever. The Plug Pack's built in AC prongs allow you to charge your phone virtually anywhere. Its built in  back-up battery allows you to charge it separately from your phone so you are never tied down by a charging cable again.Keeping your phone charged isn't the Plug Pack's only superpower, it also is an amazing way to hold and view your phone. Just plug it in above the kitchen counter, your workbench, vanity or wherever you find yourself. Our unique plug design pivots 90 degrees and gives you the ability to use and view your phone in portrait or landscape mode. Look up recipes without spilling ingredients all over your phone. Watch that YouTube tutorial without covering your phone in sawdust. Listen to the morning news or play some music in the bathroom without draining your battery or accidentally drowning your phone.

When staying charged is this easy and using your phone is more fun, you will use your phone more often -- and that is a very good thing.
Help us, help you. 
As finalists in the Indiegogo/Motorola Transform the Smartphone Challenge we are benefiting from guidance and technical support directly from the Moto Mod team at Motorola. We are working hard, but need your help to cross the finish line. Join us and help make Plug Pack the (better) way people use and charge their phone!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

This application supports games in the form of ROM digital format. Specifically, GBA (Game Boy Advance) ROMs.  !PLEASE KINDLY NOTE! that we CANNOT provide you with digital copies of ROMs (for the sake of copyrights). Each user will have to legitimately source their own ROMs of licensed/unlicensed games. Hint: Google is your friend :) ProjectPlay™  currently supports:  Surprisingly enough, manufacturing incurred costs inhibit us from providing a wider range of supported devices.OUR FIRST PRIORITY once we get up and running will be the EXPANSION of this list. We've engineered ProjectPlay™ with one thing in mind: EASE OF USEAnd in order to achieve that it DOES NOT USE BATTERIES / CABLES / BLUETOOTHAs slim as it gets, without compromising on clickyness!ProjectPlay™ only adds 3mm of thickness to your device. As slims as it gets!ENGINEERED TO THE MAX FOR THE MOST COMFORTABLE GAMING EXPERIENCEWe Built ALL THE PROTOTYPESProjectPlay™ has been in development for over 2 years! Countless prototypes and design iterations have been tested! All just so that we could GET YOU THE BEST ONE!We Built not 1, but 2 Sets of Molds just to do the prototyping of the buttons! We 3D Printed again.... and again... AND AGAIN!During its development, we've shipped ProjectPlay™ all around the world to be tested from lots of different people! We then asked them to send us a photo... and ProjectPlay™ WORLDWIDE was BORN! In order to ensure that all deadlines will be met on time and that the final product will look and work as intended, we -> Traveled All The Way To China<-and went through countless manufacturing partners before finally picking one!  And the one we picked has had a great track record of producing smartphone cases. DON'T FORGET TO->Check Out This In-Depth Post<-our of travel so far!We've taken place in numerous competitions during the development of ProjectPlay™ (flunked at most) but managed to to win some as well! The U.S. Ambassador to Greece Gaming on ProjectPlay™ !We have presented ProjectPlay™ to lots of different events, expos and people which gave us valuable feedback and helped us further develop our product!In the (hopefully) likely scenario that the campaign is overfunded, we plan to use the available funds to expand the supported devices!  Should we get this far, we will further cover whichever devices our backers vote for! 

ProjectPlay™ FamilyThe people behind ProjectPlay™A HUGE THANKS to the companies that made this happen! ProjectPlay™ ships globally*!The estimated Delivery Time to first shipments is ~ 6months. This is so that we can ensure the perfect condition of the final product (also see: Risks and Challenges). Once a product has shipped, it should take a maximum of 14 working days to reach even the most remote countries. DO NOTE: Shipping costs of ProjectPlay™ DO NOT COVER VAT/GST that might incur at local customs. *restrictions may apply for countries under embargo and/or warzones. The team behind ProjectPlay™ is working tirelessly to ensure that deliveries will be made on time. Nevertheless, developing neatly working hardware and software can be much harder than it may initially appear.Also, it is quite time consuming to test the two together, isolate a bug and fix it, especially when the bug is a hardware one. On top of which we also expect the Chinese new year to set us back a little, but that too has been taken into account when calculating the delivery timeline.   -Woah! 6 months to first shipments?! Aren't you afraid that you might get copied like it happened with >insert name -of every brand to have ever existed probably- here< ?Short answer: NoLong answer: Would you really, really, REALLY buy a knockoff?!What is it? ProjectPlay™ is a smartphone case that besides offering protection to your device can also convert it to a portable retro gaming platform. ProjectPlay™ has integrated physical buttons that can be used to game on your device once you place the case on the front side of your device. How does it work?In order to remain slim, light and discreet, ProjectPlay™ does not use cables, batteries or Bluetooth. Instead, the physical buttons are made of a magic material that allows the screen to receive input just like it would from your sausage fingers. Who built it? ProjectPlay™ has been designed and developed by Turnand Peripherals®, a hardware start-up located in Thessaloniki, Greece that designs and develops smart peripherals for smart devices. Why should I use it? Because you’re the cool kid of the block whose heart beats at an 8bit rhythm. Where can I buy it? ProjectPlay™ is currently only available right here on Indiegogo, get yours NOW and be one of the first in the world to get to game with it! How much does it cost? ProjectPlay™ Early Bird starts at a heavily discounted $29 LIMITED to the first 300 backers, after that it is available for $39. The price includes the case itself and the emulator application that will allow you to play retro games on your device. The price DOES NOT include shipping expenses and VAT/GST that might incur during shipping. Why are you crowdfunding? We are crowdfunding because Indiegogo is a great tool to fund the production costs of ProjectPlay™ and at the same time build the core of our community. Supported DevicesProjectPlay™  currently supports Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+ models and the iPhone X/Xs & Xs Max models. Surprisingly enough, manufacturing incurred costs inhibit us from providing a wider range of supported devices. This is something that is our first priority to solve once we get up and running. Why do you feature a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge on your video?You might have noticed that the demo device is a Galaxy S7 edge. Even though we won't be supporting this device. We chose to use this one to test our prototypes solely for the reason that it was the most accessible to us. Software FeaturesProjectPlay™ comes with an accompanying Emulator Application. Such an application allows your smartphone to emulate the digital environment of older gaming handhelds such as Nintendo’s Game Boy. You can learn more about Emulator Applications here:(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator ) In order to use the Emulator Application you have to load legitimately acquired digital copies of games, also known as ROM files. WE CANNOT PROVIDE you ROM files as copyrights prohibit us from doing so, IT IS UP TO THE USER to source their own ROM files (Google is your friend). You can learn more about ROMs here:(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_image ) Where do I download the accompanying emulator application from? The emulator application is undergoing development (currently in closed beta for Android and early Alpha for iOS). Once it reaches open beta stage it will be made available on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store. Is it protective?ProjectPlay™ is built with high quality shock absorbing materials in order to ensure great drop protection attributes. Of course, your phone is still prone to denting and shattering as sir Isaac Newton’s laws apply everywhere*.*we might be proven wrong in the future, plz don't hold us liable. Is it Grippy?Oh my yes! The physical buttons are made from extra grippy silicone, meaning your fingers wont slide out of place while gaming, but your device will also not slide away on slippy surfaces. Can I still use my device while gaming? ProjectPlay™ has been designed to keep your device as accessible as possible even while gaming. All ports are accessible during all times so you can still charge your phone and have your earphones (should you have a headphone jack) plugged in. Moreover, ProjectPlay™ allows the use of all of your device’s side buttons even while gaming. Where is ProjectPlay™ manufactured?ProjectPlay™ is manufactured and shipped out from China, the manufacturing capital of the majority of tech products, your iPhone, and their peripherals. Will Wireless Charging Work with ProjectPlay™ ?Just like nothing in life is perfect, so are we. The protruding buttons of ProjectPlay™ increase the distance between your device and your wireless charger to the point that your device will not charge. Or just let it rest face down and it will charge ! :)  Will ProjectPlay™ Work with Screen Protectors?ProjectPlay™ has been tested extensively with screen protectors. The vast majority of the tests were successful in working to the fullest of our expectations.  Although the added thickness of the screen protector (.3mm) might stress the case bezels in the long run.*You still using a screen protector? Take a chance!Where do you ship?ProjectPlay™ ships worldwide* *restrictions may apply for countries under embargo and/or warzones.Shipping CostsProjectPlay™ has a worldwide flat shipping rate of $9. Is VAT/GST covered?Shipping incurred VAT/GST is not covered for ProjectPlay™ . Please check with your local customs authorities. When will it ship?We estimate that the first production units will ship out approximately 6months post the campaign’s conclusion, with shipping taking a maximum of 14 working days to reach the most remote countries. Why 6 months?We understand that you may be anxious to get your hands on ProjectPlay™ as soon as possible. And we are working at full capacity to ensure that this happens. ProjectPlay™ is in pre-production prototyping phase.Some minor bugs still need to be worked out on both hardware and software levels and as we would like to refrain from over promising and under delivering we’ve chosen a safe period of 6 months to do so. Most importantly, all of our backers will be kept updated of the current status of ProjectPlay’s production/shipping timeline.   For any further questions you can e-mail us at: info@turnand.com(please keep in mind that due to high influx, reply times may widely vary) DISCLAIMERAll product names, logos, and brands shown in this video are the property of their respective owners and are used for identification purposes only.",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello World, my name is Micah Miller. I'm the owner and inventor of the Mo Charge Vertex 1. From as long as I can remember, I have been extremely good with my hands and always had an exceptional innovative mind. I was so advanced but didn't realize until I got older. My parents enrolled me in a hands-on vocational school on weekends whiles I was still a full time high school teenager. Surprisingly, I excelled and came first in the class where I was the only child among adults. As I got older, I always thought of great ideas and wondered why someone has created it or how cool it would be to have such an amazing product if it was available. Then I decided to make that product available. </p>
<p>My inventor career started in 2016 when I committed to pursue the idea of creating this amazing charger that I was extremely happy to gift the World. Months later after creating my first fully functional prototype, I realized that it would be too costly for me to create that specific charger for all the top phones in the World. I would have had to make more than 30 different chargers to accommodate the wide variety of phones on the market. I went back to the drawing board, thinking of ways of how I can make a universal charger that can charge all the top phones. As time passed and passed, prototype after prototype I finally created the perfect charger. Not only did I make a charger that can charge all the 'top' phones, I created a charger that can charge every single phone on the planet. I created the MOST Versatile Universal Portable Wireless Charger ever made.</p>
<p>I am extremely satisfied with this accomplishment, but I know the work has just started. I've been committed to bringing my dreams to life. My four-year journey consisted of three different prototypes, and now, we have the best charger in the World. This journey had many financial difficulties. Having no investors, I borrowed money from family members and close friends and pumped all my salary into this venture. This is my love, this what keeps me passionate and going, despite this long journey, I am so happy to have this opportunity to finally make my state-of-the-art device available for the World to obtain and benefit from its many features and capabilities.</p>
<p>I want to thank all my contributors/backers and all my customers in advance. Without your support this journey means nothing. Your support will help me to reach my goal of successfully starting my business and supplying the World with my industry changing device. Your support will help me to provide a better life for my family and most importantly to persons who are less fortunate. My company Mo Charge Inc has a lifetime partnership with a brand-new Non-Profit Organization to continuously assist persons who are less fortunate. Yes, a lifetime partnership. This Charger will not be the only product that my company Mo Charge invents. We have more great products to bring to life that do not exist. Every time one of our products are sold, we will contribute a significant percentage to assist others. Not only do you get an amazing device that will bring you many personal benefits, but you will also get to help persons all around the World. We thank you in advance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your 'greatly appreciated' funding will be used for a variety of things. We are currently in a position for mass production and distribution of our chargers. All the necessary stages in starting a company and preparing for mass manufacturing has already been accomplished. In the business of selling a product, advertisement is key. It is nearly impossible to sell an item to a customer if the customer doesn't know that it exists. Some Funding will be used in marketing/promoting our brand and product. By doing this, we get the word out, we get to educate people on our brand and what we do. We educate persons on our product and all its unique features and capabilities. Some Funding will be used to mass produce our products in advance prior to a customer's purchase. Some Funding will be used for research and development (R&amp;D) to start the process of creating our next state-of-the-art device. Some Funding will be used on our overhead expense and monthly bills. Some funding will be kept aside for unseen events. To summarize, your Funding will be used to advance Mo Charge Inc and put us in a position to move in a positive trajectory to have ultimate success.  There are many valuable unique perks such as, express free shipping, free colored skins, key chains, discounted chargers in bundle deals, coupons/gift cards to use on our website and becoming the first set of customers to have access to our new amazing products prior to their official launch date (Year 2021).</p>

<p>At Mo Charge Inc, we specialize in the art of versatility, bringing many important valuable users’ needs together and assembling into one, industry changing, state of the art device, the Vertex 1. Our project provides each contributor with the most versatile universal charger ever made. The Vertex 1 is a combination of all charging devices available worldwide and other devices such as a speaker and phone stand all in one. We provide our customers with more options than our competitors at nearly half the price. Purchasing the Vertex 1 is the best long-term investment. When you think of charging cases, they are only designed to charge one specific phone because they were only made to that specific dimension. On the other hand, the Vertex 1 is a universal charger that can charge every single phone on the planet and it can also charge phones that has not been made yet! (Great Long-Term Investment with an abundance of features and benefits)</p>
<p>In 2017 we made a charger that we were excited to make available for all mobile device owners. Shortly after that development we were back at the drawing board to make a more dynamic version and that is exactly what we did. We are extremely excited to offer the world a product that every mobile device owner deserve &amp; truly need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Journey started in 2016 and we encountered challenges along the way. We overcame all those challenges in dominant and impressive fashion. We rose to the occasion time and time again and always came out victorious.  We have an amazing team of individuals who always stayed composed and prepared to continue a positive trajectory of our company and its advancement. We are greatly appreciated for each contributor/backer and we assure you, that you are contributing to a group of winners and investing in the best charger ever made. We are very confident that there is no major risk ahead in providing our chargers to the contributor/backer.  We have worked hard on this journey to get to this point. Unlike most campaigns, contributors and backers DO NOT have to wait through a research &amp; development stage (R&amp;D) which includes trials and errors and can be a lengthy period. All the groundwork is completed, and we are ready for mass production! The only foreseeable challenge that may arise, is possibly shipping, due to the worldwide effects of the present pandemic. With that being said, shipping or arrival date may be slightly off, nothing to unbearable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being a contributor/backer does not only involve money. You can also 'contribute or back' our project by sharing our campaign or product and help to get the word out.  We welcome you with open arms, to join us on our journey as a new and rising company and help us educate the masses and show that a product like ours is available with its many capabilities and features. It is nearly impossible to sell a product if nobody knows that it exists. Purchasing a charger or any of our perks available for donating and sharing the word about our product is the ultimate support. However, if you're unable to contribute financially, you can share our campaign or product in any way you can. Whether that is by sending around informative text messages and/or utilizing your social media platforms.

I wanted the design to be simple, clean, and sturdy to match my iPhone's design. <br/><br/>As
 I tried to come up with an idea, I wanted something that would look 
good in my space as well. The original i Speaker design from 2009 
maintains the the C-shape dock design, but with the light function 
added. <br/><br/><p>The design includes the bottom for
charging, the middle for a speaker, the top for the light and the added front
part for making an impression as if the light and the docked smart phone seem
connected. </p>
<p>Because the surface area is small, it's easy to place other items 
next to it like the latest book you're reading, your glasses, or even 
your laptop. After the original design came out in 2009, a number of 
well-known manufacturing firms have mimicked its design with similar 
products of their own.

</div></div>","With its simple and modern design, it can go with any smartphone and fit in any space.
I wanted the design to be simple, clean, and sturdy to match my iPhone's design. As
 I tried to come up with an idea, I wanted something that would look 
good in my space as well. The original i Speaker design from 2009 
maintains the the C-shape dock design, but with the light function 
added. The design includes the bottom for
charging, the middle for a speaker, the top for the light and the added front
part for making an impression as if the light and the docked smart phone seem
connected. 
Because the surface area is small, it's easy to place other items 
next to it like the latest book you're reading, your glasses, or even 
your laptop. After the original design came out in 2009, a number of 
well-known manufacturing firms have mimicked its design with similar 
products of their own. 


Touch Switch – turning the device on and off is easy. simply touch the top of the device. 

4
 Step Dimming – you can adjust the brightness
of the light with 4 levels; 20%, 40%, 60% and 100%. 


Seven colors – you can change the color to 1 of 7 different options to change the color or
atmosphere depending on your preference.


Sleep mode – when you go to bed, you can
choose the Sleep mode option for turning the light off automatically after 30
minutes.

<div><br/></div>
<h3>Background</h3> <p>Cloud storage is big. Organizations and consumers are both jumping on it as a secure, controllable file storage medium. <b>But what if you want to use the cloud with a non-internet connected device, a game console, etc? You're out of luck</b>. And then there's that awkward moment after you've sat there on a client's PC for an hour waiting for your file to upload, and then realized you forgot to log out.</p>
<p><b><i>What if there was some way to combine the security and connectivity of cloud storage with the speed and convenience of a flash drive?</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>...WELCOME TO KATANA!</b></span><br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Katana</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Katana is a highly encrypted flash drive that's paired to your mobile device. The mobile device provides Katana with a direct connection to your favorite cloud storage service, and Katana's onboard battery allows the drive to sync after being disconnected. You can even use your Katana to sync files to/from your phone.</p>
<p><b>Katana makes cloud storage faster and easier</b>!<br/></p>
<p>Katana can also be used as a standard encrypted flash drive. The internet connection provides the Katana with optional advanced features such as remote wiping, device management, usage logging and even using geo-fencing to control encryption. Because the drive depends on the mobile device to be unlocked any organization's existing MDM solution (Airwatch, CA, EMS, etc.) automatically extends to Katana.</p>
<p><i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At our goal the prototypes for this campaign are essentially offered at cost.

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p></p>
<p>So far we have several prototypes and an alpha version of the software. Through this Indigogo campaign we'll be offering our easy to use Katana devices, but we'll also open source the designs and source code for all of the hackers out there.</p>
<p>The current platform contains upgradeable eMMC flash memory, a programmable ARM MCU with hardware encryption, and a bluetooth chip for pairing to a mobile device.</p>
<p>It's easy to use. Just pair it to your mobile device and set it up with the app. You can set up your Katana to lock and unlock in a number of different ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Flip a switch in the app after unlocking your mobile device</li>
<li>Enter a password</li>
<li>Enter a pin code</li>
<li>Unlock whenever it's paired with your mobile device</li>
<li>Unlock in certain geographies (like when you're at home)</li>
<li>Unlock when connected to certain WiFi networks</li>
</ul>
<p>Katana is a cloud connected platform and also contains the following features:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Remote wiping (through your remote wipeable mobile devices)</li>
<li>Direct uploads to your mobile device from the Katana - syncing happens even after the device is disconncted</li>
<li>Direct uploads to an incorporated cloud service (Dropbox and Google drive at the least, but we're sure the open source community will add others)</li>

<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p>We'll provide the source code for both the MCU and for the Android and iOS applications to pair to the device (could be an SDK but will likely be the full app).</p>
<p>The goal of this platform was to create a secure cloud-enabled flash drive. But imagine all of the other hacks you could create with this! You'll get an awesome way to protect your data out of the box, but also a cool hackable platform. And you'll be helping us start our company.</p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We set the campaign for a very small, reasonable goal. At this level we're providing Katana devices at cost, but the effort helps us move forward on the next generation of the device. You'll be helping to make our Katana dream come true :)</p>
<p>At our current fundraising level we can't afford an injection mold so plastic cases will likely be prototype molded or 3D printed and will be expensive. That's shy we're offering two versions - with and without a case. For all the makers out there we'll post a free case model on Thingiverse.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are no significant technical challenges. The device exists. It works. All necessary features on the next generation device have already been proven. We're only facing minor challenges in two areas:</p>
<p><i>Manufacturing:</i></p>
<p>While custom PCB manufacturing is a very mature industry, we need to find a good quality manufacturer that can build working prototypes and keep the device costs low enough to match our funding goals. Luckily we've brought in a team member, Gabriela, with a great deal of supplier quality experience to help vet potential manufacturers.</p>
<p><i>App Development:</i></p>
<p>Our goal is to allow users to copy files to the Katana and then have them sync on the go. We're running into some limitations with iOS regarding the amount of time an app can run in the background for syncing, as well as limitations with other features. We're confident, however, that most of the critical functionality can exist in the iOS app.</p>

Background Cloud storage is big. Organizations and consumers are both jumping on it as a secure, controllable file storage medium. But what if you want to use the cloud with a non-internet connected device, a game console, etc? You're out of luck. And then there's that awkward moment after you've sat there on a client's PC for an hour waiting for your file to upload, and then realized you forgot to log out.
What if there was some way to combine the security and connectivity of cloud storage with the speed and convenience of a flash drive?
...WELCOME TO KATANA!

Katana

Katana is a highly encrypted flash drive that's paired to your mobile device. The mobile device provides Katana with a direct connection to your favorite cloud storage service, and Katana's onboard battery allows the drive to sync after being disconnected. You can even use your Katana to sync files to/from your phone.
Katana makes cloud storage faster and easier!
Katana can also be used as a standard encrypted flash drive. The internet connection provides the Katana with optional advanced features such as remote wiping, device management, usage logging and even using geo-fencing to control encryption. Because the drive depends on the mobile device to be unlocked any organization's existing MDM solution (Airwatch, CA, EMS, etc.) automatically extends to Katana.
At our goal the prototypes for this campaign are essentially offered at cost. What this campaign is enabling us to do is to develop the next generation of the device and help us prove to potential investors that interest exists in the product.


The Technology

So far we have several prototypes and an alpha version of the software. Through this Indigogo campaign we'll be offering our easy to use Katana devices, but we'll also open source the designs and source code for all of the hackers out there.
The current platform contains upgradeable eMMC flash memory, a programmable ARM MCU with hardware encryption, and a bluetooth chip for pairing to a mobile device.

Flip a switch in the app after unlocking your mobile device
Enter a password

Unlock whenever it's paired with your mobile device
Unlock in certain geographies (like when you're at home)
Unlock when connected to certain WiFi networks

Katana is a cloud connected platform and also contains the following features:


Remote wiping (through your remote wipeable mobile devices)
Direct uploads to your mobile device from the Katana - syncing happens even after the device is disconncted
Direct uploads to an incorporated cloud service (Dropbox and Google drive at the least, but we're sure the open source community will add others)

FAQ


Bluetooth doesn't have much bandwidth. How can you upload to the cloud?Katana has on board flash memory and a battery. Files will be copied to the Katana, then copied to the mobile device, then uploaded to the cloud. Small files will appear to upload almost instantly but larger files might take some time to synchronize. Note that we're using Bluetooth instead of other technologies like Ad-Hoc WiFi for simplicity and reliability. Plus, the Bluetooth link allows the device to work closely with the mobile phone and allows lots of other great features such as geo-fencing to control encryption.


Why make a Japanese video?We wanted to make something fun and were aiming for a Manga but this was the closest we could get on our limited budget :)

We've formed a team that truly wants to make the Scratchilla app a reality. If we reach our campaign goal, rest assured that our development team won't disappoint you. We'll create an app for you with the love and passion for back scratching ;-)</p>

<p><b>1. When will you release the app?</b><br/></p>
<p>May 2016<br/></p>
<p><b>2. Where did you get the idea? </b></p>
<p>As mentioned in the video, all of us (David especially) love to have our backs scratched. In these days it’s normal to invite a masseur/masseuse to work, so why not invite someone who would scratch your back or head.</p>
<p><b>3. What are the Scratchcoins mentioned in the video?</b></p>
<p>Scratchcoins are the name of the credit units you will use to pay for scratching services. You can either buy scratchcoins with real money or gain them in a game. </p>
<p><b>4. Can Scratchillas be men?</b></p>
<p>Of course! Ladies will be thrilled!</p>
<p><b>5. Couldn’t  the Scratchilla services be misused to endanger  someone?</b></p>
<p>We are aware that there may be some undesirable people who would try to misuse the app. That’s why we designed a sophisticated safety system to protect each Scratchilla. When activated, the application sends text messages to emergency contacts with the Scratchilla persons's current location.</p>
<p><b>6. Do you have more questions?</b></p>
<p>Don't hesitate to email us at <a href=""mailto:info@scratchilla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@scratchilla.com</a> (in English or Czech). We'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

“Dr. Gil Yosipovitch, a professor of dermatology at Wake Forest University in Winston Salem, N.C., found scratching activated areas of the brain associated with memory and pleasure.” January 31, 2008





It’s true. Scratching your back and head:



reduces stress


relieves fatigue


relaxes your muscles


increases focus, energy


improves quality of sleep


activates your nerve endings


improves your lymphatic system


makes your blood circulation more efficient


releases a decent amount of serotonin and…



...makes you feel awesome.

“Neuroscientists at the University of Minnesota report that specialized cells in the spinal cord appear to be critically involved in producing the sensation of itch and the feeling of relief after the application of fingernails, at least in healthy individuals.” April 6, 2009






Intuitive searching system will help you find the nearest Scratchillas according to their location, ratings, price or photo



Pre-order a back scratch for a specific date and time


Sophisticated safety system that will protect each Scratchilla in case that some back scratcher would tend to behave inappropriately. Safety for each and every Scratchilla is our top priority!



Rating function so you can rate each Scratchilla’s skills




This is just the very beginning of the Scratchilla line of products because we have a strong vision and big dreams. In future versions we plan to add many more features including gamification or a chat window for chatting with your Scratchilla…

May 2016

First public release for iOS and Android.







This isn't our first project, we've successfully launched couple of applications for the App Store and we also run one of the biggest European websites for videomakers - www.videoflot.com. We've formed a team that truly wants to make the Scratchilla app a reality. If we reach our campaign goal, rest assured that our development team won't disappoint you. We'll create an app for you with the love and passion for back scratching ;-)



1. When will you release the app?
May 2016
2. Where did you get the idea? 
As mentioned in the video, all of us (David especially) love to have our backs scratched. In these days it’s normal to invite a masseur/masseuse to work, so why not invite someone who would scratch your back or head.
3. What are the Scratchcoins mentioned in the video?
Scratchcoins are the name of the credit units you will use to pay for scratching services. You can either buy scratchcoins with real money or gain them in a game. 
4. Can Scratchillas be men?
Of course! Ladies will be thrilled!
5. Couldn’t  the Scratchilla services be misused to endanger  someone?
We are aware that there may be some undesirable people who would try to misuse the app. That’s why we designed a sophisticated safety system to protect each Scratchilla. When activated, the application sends text messages to emergency contacts with the Scratchilla persons's current location.
6. Do you have more questions?
Don't hesitate to email us at info@scratchilla.com (in English or Czech). We'll get back to you as soon as possible.




With any software development, there are potential risks with unforeseen variables which could cause launch delays. While this is always a possibility, we don't expect this to play a significant role given the stage we're at.
We will keep our backers up to date with our progress and let you know if we encounter any setbacks.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Smartphones have revolutionized our lives. They have allowed us to connect to the internet, play games, and keep in touch with each other all without needing a bulky PC tethered to a power outlet. Smartphones are getting more and more powerful each month, and advancements such as fingerprint readers, force-sensitive displays, and faster operating systems have made them fast, secure, and powerful devices that everyone use.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Despite all these advancements, battery technology has remained the same. Smartphone makers have had to make tradeoffs between form and function. On one hand, it's possible to make devices with massive batteries. But this makes them huge and bulky. It's also possible to make extremely slim devices with tiny batteries. But these devices dont't last typical users through even one day. </span></p>

</div></div>","Smartphones have revolutionized our lives. They have allowed us to connect to the internet, play games, and keep in touch with each other all without needing a bulky PC tethered to a power outlet. Smartphones are getting more and more powerful each month, and advancements such as fingerprint readers, force-sensitive displays, and faster operating systems have made them fast, secure, and powerful devices that everyone use.
Despite all these advancements, battery technology has remained the same. Smartphone makers have had to make tradeoffs between form and function. On one hand, it's possible to make devices with massive batteries. But this makes them huge and bulky. It's also possible to make extremely slim devices with tiny batteries. But these devices dont't last typical users through even one day. 
Mobile battery packs have risen in popularity to address this problem, but they need to be charged before use. We already have enough devices that need to be charged, why have one more?




LifeCable is a power-sharing cable that allows you to transfer battery power between any two mobile devices, whether they're iPhones or Androids.





Connect LifeCable to the device you want to take power from.
Connect the other end of LifeCable to the device you want to transfer power to.

Power is transferred between the two devices.




We researched many different cable designs and we settled on the flat design. It's simple, easy to manufacture, looks good, and it results in significantly fewer tangles than a standard round cable. 



LifeCable will be manufactured with the highest quality aluminum Lightning and Micro-USB connectors, ensuring that nothing cracks or breaks from every-day use.




We made LifeCable 25% longer than other cables so you and your neighbor have complete freedom to move around and use your devices while transferring power. 





LifeCable is Apple MFi certified, meaning it's certified by Apple to work with any iOS device. This certification ensures that you don't have to worry about LifeCable damaging your Apple devices.



Using our patent pending power sharing technology, power flows from one side of the cable to the other, allowing you to transfer power to other mobile devices directly from your own. This technology is able to quickly and safely take power from almost any smartphone, so there's no need to worry about potential damage to your device or your neighbor's device. Power flows at a rate that is about the same as a standard charging cable plugged into a computer USB port, allowing for fast and hassle-free charging.Yes, it will!LifeCable is the only power sharing cable on the market that features both a Micro-USB and a Lightning port on both sides of the cable, meaning that almost every mobile device currently on the market is compatible. But what about USB-C?We realize that USB-C is rapidly taking over the smartphone industry, and we're developing a version of LifeCable with USB-C that'll be available soon after this campaign ends.Thanks to some early supporters, LifeCable is almost ready for full production.We've completed almost all of the electrical, industrial, and mechanical design and we have several working prototypes(one of them is in our video!). We've spent many months refining LifeCable to be functional, user friendly, and beautiful.To be able to manufacture LifeCable, we have to purchase several molds. Molds are used in almost every consumer product you can buy. They take 6-8 weeks to produce, and the ones we need cost about $14,000. We also have to make optimizations and refine our power sharing technology to make it smaller and more efficient. Producing this technology also requires funding - another reason we need your support!

























The LifeCable campaign isn't just about raising funds. We value our early adopters and we want you to help us shape the final version of the product! Our stretch goals will be based on your suggestions from Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Your contribution is extremely important to the success of the product. Have something you'd like to see in the campaign? Tell us about it! We hope you share our ideas with us and help shape the final version!



We're a team of individuals dedicated to making lives easier through technology. All of the team members involved joined because they are extremely passionate in what they do and because they genuinely believe in our product and our vision for the future.
Thank you to everyone who helped make this a reality.


























Our team has faced a number of risks and challenges throughout the development of LifeCable. Our first challenge was with manufacturing. After months of searching for the perfect factory(we've reviewed hundreds), we think we've found the perfect manufacturer for our product. We've established a close relationship with this factory throughout the last 6 months, and we are certain that they can meet any production demands we present them with.
For shipping, we are aware that unexpected delays occur all the time. For this reason, we will make absolute sure that the cables are shipped ahead of time so that everyone receives their perks by April.


We estimate that LifeCable will begin shipping to backers in April of 2016. 

Keep in mind that Indiegogo isn't like other online stores. When you fund our product, you're paying for our engineering, design, manufacturing, and shipping. In other words, you're not just paying for the product itself - you're paying for everything needed to make the product.


We've been developing LifeCable for over 8 months now, and we've gone through many iterations to find the perfect balance of aesthetics and functionality. We already have several working prototypes, and we've been able to prepare detailed CAD drawings and electrical schematics. 

Our manufacturer has sent us product samples of other mobile accessories they produce, and based on these samples we're confident in their ability to make any sort of charging cable quickly and and with high quality. They've also evaluated our CAD files and electrical drawings and have given us a full estimate of how long it will take to manufacture the tooling necessary for our product. We've been in contact with this manufacturer for over 6 months now, and the only thing holding us back from a full production run is funds. 


In our testing, we have not observed any significant drop in battery health for any devices used with LifeCable. The rate that power is taken from a device used with LifeCable is only about 0.6amps, which is only about a third of the maximum discharge rate that even the smallest Li-ion batteries can handle. To put it simply, your devices are guaranteed to be safe with LifeCable.


Yes, it is!



We know how frustrating it can be when you have to take your phone case off to fit a charging cable into the port. The LifeCable in the video is a pre-production prototype and the housing pieces were made by a 3D printer. Injection molded parts and downsizing of our power sharing technology will make the final version of LifeCable much slimmer. We'll make sure it fits every phone case we can get our hands on before we ship it to you.


LifeCable is not waterproof, and we strongly advise staying away from water especially while using LifeCable. If your cable does happen to get wet, letting it fully dry should make it safe to use again.


We will contact all backers a few weeks before shipping with a survey. This survey will include a confirmation of your shipping address, as well as an option to change your address if you need to.


Our video was made entirely by Daniel and Adlar(the founder and cofounder) with the generous help of a few of their close friends. The actors in the video are Nathan Skinner and Michael Paz and the video was shot at the home of Chase Hornsby. The cinematography was mostly done by Nathan Skinner, and the motion graphics were done by Daniel.






15% of our profits will be donated to the American Red Cross from LifeCables sold AFTER our campaign ends. We are fully supportive of donating to a good cause, but we would have to raise our funding goal significantly if we donated 15% of the funds from our campaign to the American Red Cross.

production will occur; and we have engineers in China and India who have built
this kind of product before. We’re well prepared for the journey ahead.</i></p>
<p><i>Finally,
the very nature of this concept device means the exact component list is fluid
until we enter production to ensure we’re picking the best available part at
the time.</i></p>

About Our Project

The ECG
Smartphone is an exclusive production run, available  through Indiegogo. All of the funding we
receive goes directly towards producing the device for expected delivery in
October 2016.
A lot of
people around the world have collaborated to get us this far. We have a
beautiful prototype ECG Smartphone handset, we have experienced  manufacturing partners in place, and we have
incredibly talented and passionate people to put it all together.
All we need is you


Risk and Challenges 
 
Although
our core business is to develop Innovated products which will help the people
to keep their life healthy, we know the phone and medical device industry
pretty well too. We’ve been working with manufacturers , so everything we need
is already in place. We also have a team based in china where the bulk of the
production will occur; and we have engineers in China and India who have built
this kind of product before. We’re well prepared for the journey ahead.
Finally,
the very nature of this concept device means the exact component list is fluid
until we enter production to ensure we’re picking the best available part at
the time.

Project Plan Schedule

What Countries and Mobile Network will support the ECG Smartphone ?
ECG Smartphone is Dual SIM open device, not locked to any particular network. It works in all countries that provide GSM/3G/LTE-based network services. It will also support the two LTE standards to provide 4G mobile broadband connectivity around the world (subject to network availability and data fees). Before launch we will conduct interoperability testing with networks in Europe, the US, South America, China, India, the Middle East and Africa. This is a normal step in the process of developing a mobile device.

It comes programmed with a ton of functions and features that have otherwise been overlooked by the “thermostat” industry.  Because SmartPID Controller can control any thermos-regultated process, heating or cooling, it is the only controller of its kind that you need in your name. Throw out your old, clunky thermostat: the time for an upgrade is right now. You can also use SmartPID Controller to control any applications in your home, both locally and remotely. Flexible and powerful, this is a device that can be adapted to any number of situation. It is compatible with the Arduino ecosystem as well.Compared to your basic on/off thermostat, SmartPID is a piece of futuristic wonder. This controller can collect temperature from multiple sensors, apply a custom and programmable control logic, and drive different loads (heater, cooler, valve, fan, etc.) with a precise algorithm. It is easy to replace your thermostat and use SmartPID to integrate full process control, data logs, and remote management.SmartPID Controller is going to be a must-have device for do-it-yourself enthusiasts, technology geeks, and consumers who want something affordable that is also ultra-functional.With SmartPID process automation, everything from homebrewing to wine making to aquarium maintenance to oven temperature is made more precise, more powerful, and more flexible.In one word make your temperature process control SMARTSmartPID is neither a simple controller nor a themostat: it is an “open platform” in which the resources and I/O can be used for a variety of applications and in a variety of environments. The idea behind SmartPID is to develop an ecosystem of “vertical” applications on top of a common set of features, providing tools for people who would like to develop their own applications or hack existing ones.Smart Thermostat is the modern standard for any thermal regulated process. It can be used and adapted anywhere a PID control is needed or used to perform a retrofit of a simple thermostat with something more advanced. A typical example would be a fermentation chamber.This smart homebrewing app is a vertical application that is dedicated to brewing process automation from mashing to boiling, from the addition of hops to whirlpool and cooling, including recipe management.The video show you SmartPID integration in a commercial pot to build and single vessel all in one automated brewing system 

 

With your support, we will expand the number of vertical applications on top of the SmartPID platform.
Other applications that are feasible right now include:
BBQ temperature controller  
Coffer Roaster automation  
Food dehydrator control
Pot still control
All applications benefit from a full set of common features that are the baseline to developing smart applications.One of the unique smart features of the SmartPID Controller is its capability to store process log data and then make that data available either locally via USB interface or remotely via the cloud. You can easily access your data from the web on a desktop, smartphone, or tablet, which is perfect in case of critical situations that involve alarms and triggers. Plus, if your fridge goes into a block stage or your food dehydrator finishes its process, you can set up SmartPID to let you know.One of the unique and SMART features of the SmartPID controller is the capability to store all process log data and make it available either locally via USB interface or with the cloud.Among many different possible IoT solutions for SmartPID in this phase is the Thingspeak service. Thingspeak is based on a number of useful features that make it easy to use and integrate the SmartPID project.
Real-time data collection and storage of process data generated by SmartPID    
Simple and effective data visualization in both private and public channels  
MATLAB® for data analysis and manipulation    
Alerts and triggers for integration with other services    
Scheduling    
Open API
The relevant code is available on github, and in the future, a dedicated cloud service will be provided (see stretch goal section). SmartPID is 100% compatible with the Arduino echo system: you can plug in your PC via USB and program through the Arduino IDE.   The key benefits of this design choice are
SAMD21 processor-based (like Zero or MKR1000)   
Dedicated USB bootloader and board definition   
Fully programmable via Arduino IDE   
Full set of support libraries available
smartPID has been designed by a maker for the maker communityWe have developed a mobile app prototype for Android in order to retrieve data from the cloud server and in turn visualize that data on a smartphone.  SmartPID pushes log data to a remote server so that the mobile app can retrieve it in a secure and encrypted way.The smart app allows you to do the following:  
Login and authenticate user login on the server in order to access it in a secure way  
Display and visualize data via a dashboard so that the user can select a specific controller and data (filtered by date/time) and display the data in a graphic or tabular way  
Configure the device (this part is still under development)
You can configure all the unit parameters (HW set up, process parameter) via a web interface or mobile app and upload your configuration options on the device. Configuration options can then be stored on the server and used at any time. You can also set a temperature threshold and get notifications by local alarm, email, or Twitter.developing application for both android and IOS and set up all the server infrastructure is complex and requires lot of investment, this is one of the part in scope od the crowdfunding campaingSmartPID is a masterpiece of engineering. We have done our best to incorporate a ton of advanced features into a single compact box. Below you will find a table with all technical characteristicSmartPID is powered by SAMD21 32-bit ARM® Cortex®-M0+ by AtmelThis is a simple example of how you can integrate your SmartPID Controller in a typical brewing system with two vessels (mash tun + HLT).The dual-channel controller makes it possible for you to read temperature from two probes (either DS18B20 or NTC) and drive two SSRs for the heating element control and process automation The 110/220V AC pump is controlled by relay.The smart homebrewing applications do the rest. Just select a recipe and leave SmartPID Controller to work. n this example, you can use the smart thermostat application to build a thermostatic fermentation chamber controlling a fridge motor and heating elements via relay.Your beer fermentation will run to perfection regardless of the season.This is due to thermostatic control.These are a few examples of prototypes made by hacking a commercial product.This is a prototype of a single vessel all-in-one brewing system in which SmartPID drives the heating element and a 12V pump.This Kitchen oven has been hacked to build a re-flow oven for SMD component soldering SamrtPID automated temperature ramps and time.This food dehydrator is hacked with SmartPID Controller, which takes over the heating element and fan speed in order to manage temperature profile for perfect drying.this are just of the few examples of applications where you can use SmartPID but with your support and pledge we can continue development and grow the number of applicationsLet us go over a little project history...This smart controller design comes from my long-time passions for homebrewing, technology, and engineering. In the course of my brewing “career,” I have found that enthusiasm for DIY is common. Leveraging my engineering skills, I put together several prototypes of a small-scale brewery, eventually expanding into something advanced and professional.Going pro in HW startup is complex, building hardware is hard, and mass production is demanding.   The steps from a fully functional prototype to mass production are critical and expensive, which is why I have come to you for help. Rewards usage breakdown  This project is in an advanced phase. To this point, all design work, software development, and engineering has been self-funded, but I need community support to get to the finish line and go live with SmartPID
DFM (design for manufacturing). With the help of a professional engineer, I'm reviewing all design work in order to verify product engineering in such a way that the product is easy to manufacture. The DFM phase will focus on cost optimization and potential problems going forward.
Certification. I started the certification process (CE marking and FCC), and I have engaged certified laboratory tests to perform test sessions and verify compliance according to international security standards (ECM and LVD)
BoM optimization and component sourcing. I'm working to find the best PCB and component supplier with a good quality-to-cost ratio
Tooling and mass production setup. Setting up PCB production, assembling process, case print, and front panel digital printing will require some investment.
Fulfillment. In order to provide a great delivery service, I'm working with a small distribution chain to arrange all the parcel shipments and management.
I will use part of your pledge to go through these steps, but in order to go live, we must first and foremost fulfill the minimum number of orders as set by the manufacturer.   Electronic device production entails significant economies of scale, making products such as this one particularly tricky to execute. Plus, because I'm fully committed to keeping the price point accessible to the DIY and maker community, your support as we raise this start-up capital is essential. Below a rough breakdown of the reward usage You may be asking yourself right now “What is in the box?” Each perk that includes one or more SmartPID Controllers will also include the following:  1) A controller box with pre-loaded and tested software.

The special shape of the handle allows you to hold your tablet in the most ergonomic way for comfort in any position.The ergonomic shape of the Stick Tab allows you to be in the perfect position for holding your tablet while:Relaxing in bedIn the gardenAt the officeAt the kitchen counter or when needing your hands for doing something else  STICKY PAD What makes the Stick Tab stand out is its support pad which allows it to stick to any device. This revolutionary material is always sticky and leaves no residue on the device it sticks to. And compared to other tablet holders on the market, there's nothing to fix to your tablet.Just push the sticky pad against the back side of your tablet and you're good to go! Removing it is just as easy. Just hold your tablet or e-reader and gently pull-off the Stick Tab using one of the two curved-shape grips.A special plastic film is also provided for protecting the sticky pad from dust while not using it. If you're wondering if the pad will stick after months of use, don't worry.  Wash it with water and a drop of liquid soap, let it dry and this very special substance will instantly regain its original stickiness. It's that easy!IN YOUR HAND OR USE TABLETOP STAND      No need for another stand for the tabletop.The Stick Tab is so versatile, use it for all your tabletop needs; on a desk or a table for your morning news while having breakfast, reading an electronic book, checking emails or surfing the net, or even on your kitchen counter checking your favorite recipes.Just untighten the ring underneath the support pad, set it to the angle you want and tighten it back so it remains in your desired position. All of that in a matter of a few seconds.Wondering if your tablet will slide back when using the touchscreen? We got you covered. We've added an anti-slip ring on the bottom of the Stick Tab so you can enter whatever you want on the screen without having to hold your tablet with your other hand. It will stay there and not move back.RECHARGEABLE AND REMOVABLE OPTIONAL POWER BANK     We've used the space inside the handle to fit an optional USB Power Bank. This is not a standard USB charger.Most tablets require a minimum input current for triggering the recharging function. That's why people have a hard time recharging their tablet using something other than the USB wall charger they got with their device.We've designed our charger to provide a full 1.5 Amp output so it can recharge tablets and e-readers, but also any other USB compatible devices like phones, cameras, GPS, and video cameras. We wanted to stress versatility and performance!Being small and powerful has the advantage of allowing you to carry the battery with you inside the Stick Tab handle.  Always be ready for any charging emergency!And you don't have a cable to purchase! Just use the one that came with your device and we provide the cable needed for recharging the USB Power Bank which connects to your wall charger that came with your tablet, e-reader or other USB compatible device.Optional removable USB charger inside the handle has been designed to meet specs that can recharge high demanding iPads as well as any other tablet or USB compatible device.FOLDABLE AND EASY TO CARRYBeing such a great companion, we've made it so you can carry it with you wherever you go.We've designed the tightening ring for ease of folding and storing in your purse, brief case, luggage or even in your inside coat pocket. - Universal Tablet Holder- Charge on the go!- Comfortable- Ergonomic- In Hand or As a Stand Alone- Affordable- Optional USB Charger that fits in the handle  We started around the houseWe wrapped everything together to get a basic conceptNext we tried making a prototype out of spare parts and the Stick Tab was taking shapeAfter hiring an engineer to create CAD spec drawings we printed a 3D version of Stick Tab          and knew we were onto somethingNext we sent all our specs, designs and homemade samples to a factory where we finally        had our first functioning Stick TabAfter loads of testing, focus group analysis and product improvements, including adding an optional rechargeable power bank inside the handle, we had our final production ready prototype.Time to share our fun new tablet buddy with the world!  Tablets are used for more and more tasks like browsing the internet, checking our Facebook account, reading and sending emails, ebooks, watching movies, storing recipes, playing games and loads of other things.After months of discomfort while using our tablet and having no solution to the problem of comfortably holding it in our hands as well as on a tabletop, we decided to develop a product addressing both issues.We designed a tablet holder that fits with current or future brands of any size tablets or readers.

The signal

Red

No

If we do not reach our goal then Mico will not get to production!</p><p> </p><h3>FAQs</h3><p><strong>What if it's not sunny?</strong></p><p>Mico functions as a normal battery mod for Moto Z smartphones, with an internal battery of 2200mAh providing over 75% more power for a Moto Z/Droid! The thought behind the solar panel is the level of freedom it provides the user. While in everyday life it will keep the battery topped up that little bit longer (helping it to outperform some of the competition depending on lighting conditions), it is when you take the Mico into an outdoors situation such as hiking in the hills or a long day out in the summer it truly begins to shine! (No pun intended.) Even in office situations the Mico is able to charge – just leave it by the window.</p><p>Snap-Panels, while also adding another 1000mAh battery and being easily moved around can double the charging speed of your Mico! Snap-Panels provide extra freedom; the core purpose of the modular approach Moto Mods give their users!</p><p><strong>What value do Snap-Panels bring?</strong></p><p>The main USP for Snap-Panels is that they provide a USB Type-C solar battery bank that can be used not only in conjunction with the Mico but to charge any USB Type-C device, especially as this is quickly becoming the standard. A USB Type-C extension cable will also be included in the box.</p><p><strong>Will it get too hot?</strong></p><p>We are currently experimenting with insulating and cooling materials whilst carrying out our testing - so far with positive results. Although it should be noted that if it is too hot to sit in the scorching sun for hours then obviously you don't want to put any gadgets outside for long periods of time. Simply sitting Mico and/or Snap-Panels by the window in a cool building would be enough to charge it. And remember Mico is a Moto Mod so can be detached from your phone at any time, if you are worried about your phone overheating while you charge up Mico simply detach it from your device.</p><h3> </h3><p>Moto Mods™ is a trademark of Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC.</p></div>","Developer Update #1

The Moto Z brings modular technology to a whole new level, you may be aware of some of the existing Moto mods available and the freedom that they bring. Mico takes that a step further making your smartphone, truly yours. Mico is the world's first solar charger Moto Mod! Mico has a 2200mAh battery giving you 75% more power for your Moto Z with the integrated solar cell allowing it to continue to charge throughout the day. This provides vital charge, on a camping trip, whilst out on a hike, or even in an emergency. Even in everyday use Mico will keep your internal battery fuller for longer helping to offset that dreaded power cable – not to mention, solar power is FREE!Mico can be configured by your Moto Z for your charging preferences. You can set either default mode to keep your phone at 100% charge, or efficiency mode to keep your phone at 80% battery while helping Mico to last longer.Mico is extra modular too, with the ability to use Snap-Panels at the same time (up to 2 Snap-Panels can be used at once when attached to Mico). Just snap them into Mico’s USB Type-C input ports. The Snap-Panels allow you to double Mico’s solar charging rate when plugged in, but of course Snap-Panels are always charging up their own internal 1000mAh battery whenever light is available.Snap-Panels are also their own stand-alone product, there is no need to own Mico or even a Moto Z smartphone to use them, simply plug into any USB Type-C compatible device and charge!Mico Charging TimesMico will be able to charge in approximately an hour and a half through the phone via turbo charger!Via Solar power Mico can charge in approximately 10 hours of good sunlight. With 1 Snap-Panel Mico can charge in approximately 5 hours of good sunlight.SpecificationsMico Moto Mod ConceptAdditional SpecificationsCompatibility: Moto Z, Z Force, Z Play, Z DroidDimensions: 152.7 x 73.5 x 7mm How does it work?
Charge Mico up before the start of your day just as you would with your phone;
Dock Mico onto the back of your Moto Z like you would any other Moto Mod;
Select how you want Mico to keep your phone powered;
Let Mico do the rest!
You use Snap-Panels to keep Mico topped up if you’re a super heavy user or on an extra-long trip.Snap-Panels for Mico and other USB Type-C DevicesThe team consists of 2 electronic  and electrical engineering students (both named Ross) from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. The development of both Mico and Snap-Panels is still under way but the internal designs should be finalised soon. Development and ManufacturingUpdate (15/02/17)Mico Prototype MK1 works! Our first working iteration of Mico is complete and fully operational. We are now carrying out testing to see what performance we can expect from Mico and areas we can improve the design. Including shrinking the size of the electronics down and fitting a bigger more efficient panel into the design. We are also currently in talks with manufacturers who are helping us to ensure the highest quality materials and fabrication methods are used. Arrow Electronics are a sponsor of this campaign and will be helping with reduced prototyping costs and engineering expertise!  Press materialsWebsite Share our project on social media to let the world know! We rely on you, the backers in order to make this product a reality! If we do not reach our goal then Mico will not get to production! FAQsWhat if it's not sunny?Mico functions as a normal battery mod for Moto Z smartphones, with an internal battery of 2200mAh providing over 75% more power for a Moto Z/Droid! The thought behind the solar panel is the level of freedom it provides the user. While in everyday life it will keep the battery topped up that little bit longer (helping it to outperform some of the competition depending on lighting conditions), it is when you take the Mico into an outdoors situation such as hiking in the hills or a long day out in the summer it truly begins to shine! (No pun intended.) Even in office situations the Mico is able to charge – just leave it by the window.Snap-Panels, while also adding another 1000mAh battery and being easily moved around can double the charging speed of your Mico! Snap-Panels provide extra freedom; the core purpose of the modular approach Moto Mods give their users!What value do Snap-Panels bring?The main USP for Snap-Panels is that they provide a USB Type-C solar battery bank that can be used not only in conjunction with the Mico but to charge any USB Type-C device, especially as this is quickly becoming the standard. A USB Type-C extension cable will also be included in the box.Will it get too hot?We are currently experimenting with insulating and cooling materials whilst carrying out our testing - so far with positive results. Although it should be noted that if it is too hot to sit in the scorching sun for hours then obviously you don't want to put any gadgets outside for long periods of time. Simply sitting Mico and/or Snap-Panels by the window in a cool building would be enough to charge it. And remember Mico is a Moto Mod so can be detached from your phone at any time, if you are worried about your phone overheating while you charge up Mico simply detach it from your device. Moto Mods™ is a trademark of Motorola Trademark Holdings, LLC.",9.0,2,"1 Campaign

The two IR LEDs enables it to work within the distance of 60 feet with a coverage angle of 150 degree. ZaZaRemoteControl has the capability to penetrate 2 floors to control lamps. It also supports mobile phone to control electrical appliances remotely through ZaZaRemoteControl. Please read the followings for details.  Download ZaZaRemote APP to mobile phones, scan two-dimensional code of ZaZaRemoteControl, link ZaZaRemoteControl to ZaZaRemote APP, and then all remote control functions of ZaZaRemoteControl can be used in your mobile phone right away. You can manage it all from your phone, tablet, or both.  ZaZaRemoteControl makes a wireless control solution using 2.4G frequency technology; about 70% of lighting factories from China will use this solution after Oct 2016. ZaZaRemoteControl identifies a transmission speed of 62.5Kbits for it, so high spreading gain is achieved. It can remote control a light 300 feet away, and a light 75 feet away separated by two walls.Working principles of 2.4G RF frequency remote control in ZaZaRemoteControl: remote control chips of lamp and box are monitoring signals; they will not act until receiving any orders. Remote control chips of ZaZaRemoteControl only send out signals after receiving orders or when users check the status of lamps. So with no signal sent out, there is no radiation pollution in idle times. With the spread spectrum technology, the radiation of ZaZaRemoteControl is much lower than mobile phone and Wi-Fi modem when its remote control works. It is safe to the human body.   315M, 433M and 800M use carrier mode, their signal can be captured, similar to IR. So if some malicious person copies the signal, he can control electrical appliance by replaying the signal. ZaZaRemoteControl 2.4G RF frequency uses digital encryption, supports 40 frequency points, use frequency hopping anti-jamming, criminals are very difficult to interfere, also it cannot be captured to replay and the transmission is safe. The 2.4G RF wireless security system, especially suitable for housing has been completed renovation. As the alarm unit is battery powered (replaced battery per 5,000 times signal sending, about 5~8 years), so ZaZaRemoteControl can still provide security alarm when house power is off. (Maybe the thief would cut off the house power)Accessary-----2.4G Remote bulb (ready now)ZaZaRemoteControl has some powerful accessories such as monochromatic lamp, monochromatic adjustable brightness lamp, and 160K true color lamp. The control distance is 300 feet away or 75 feet away separated by two walls.Accessary-----2.4G Lamp RF receiver (ready now)ZaZaRemoteControl also has an accessory “Lamp RF receiver”; your lamps or appliances will be upgraded to remote control lamps by this box.Accessary-----2.4G Self-Powered RF switch (ready now)As a supplement of ZaZaRemoteControl home control system, we provide “Self-Powered RF switch”. When users press the switch, it will generate electricity and send out remote control signals. Being limited by electricity, the remote control distance is about 35 feet. So it can be placed on the bedside to control corridor lights near the bedroom. The Self-Powered RF switch is divided into two parts, chassis parts can be installed on the wall, between the chassis and the switch are two magnetic blocks, the switch can be easily removed and placed.Accessary-----2.4G Battery-Powered RF switch (ready now) As a supplement of ZaZaRemoteControl home control system, we provide “Battery-Powered RF switch”, the remote control distance is about 60 feet. Both “Self-Powered RF switch” and “Battery-Powered RF switch” are supplements to home remote control system. One switch can control several bulbs and remote boxes at the same time, being convenient for users. If users want to know the status of all lamps, they can check it on their mobile phones or via ZaZaRemoteControl.

<p><strong>Simple to Use</strong><br/>Whenever you're not sure where you parked, just open up the app, and the AR (Augmented Reality) display will tell you where your car is. After the initial set up, the device will memorize the car's location every time you park, so you don't have to do anything. Let your device do the rest. Whether your car is parked underground or on the roof top, the app will always show you on which floor and where your car is parked, giving you a useful and fun AR experience.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>In order to locate your car, we combine GPS(Global Positioning System) and DR (Dead Reckoning) methodology data captured by your device. In DR, we use an Acceleration Sensor (captures the acceleration and deceleration speed), a Gyroscope Sensor (captures the right and left rotation), and a Barometric altimeter (captures the altitude) to locate your car's position.  When a GPS cannot be used, we use a combination of these sensors to locate your car. By combining the functions of both the device and the smartphone, we can accurately locate the positioning of your car.</p>

<p>Our campaign is based on the improvement of the actual chargers to a new and more compact version, allowing to carry with you and your phone charger to everywhere in a comfortable way. This is our baby and we want to see it grow with your support, because this product is for everyone.</p>
<p>With your help we will accomplish our goal to make the final investment to go on mass production and reach different markets in America, collaborating on making our life more comfortable and simple.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are asking for  $30, 000 USD. We'll finance our project and the way we are planning on use is:</p>
<p>Purchase 2 molds for the body parts that conform our product, each mold costs 10,000 USD and the rest will be used to purchase the electronic components as well as the consumables. Also to pay the workforce, the labor and to buy the rewards showed in the rewards section that are not directly produce by us.</p>
<p>By selecting one of our rewards you will receive an amount of the NOMADA charger bracelets depending on the perk that you selected and additional products that will help you become a NOMADA and be ready to pursue any adventure. (*purchasing the rewards where the bracelet is offered as a part of the reward)</p>
<p>In case we don't achieve the goal and receive the money you give us, we will continue in the pursue of launching our product to the market, also we will give you the selected reward and place your name in our web site (when launched) as part of the people who made this dream come true.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is only the first product we are launching, this charger bracelet is a way we found to start making noise and get out of the established standards for the chargers that are actually in the market, products that you can carry with you everywhere you go without facing failures because you bend it, because you dropped it or because you forgot one of the parts somewhere else.</p>
<p>Also this will contribute to create the foundation of a series of products that will create easier ways to stay connected. We are planning on continuing making high quality products that are easy to handle, not causing a hard time on people and hopefully in the future, will have a good impact on the planet.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We all know that launch a product have a several amount of risks and challenges, it's not easy and certainly not for everyone, the people that use their energy, time and effort to share their ideas with the world  and those who make it until the end deserve all our respect and we take the hat in front of them.</p>
<p>The challenges we have faced is to find people we can trust the manufacture of our product, we went through a lot of possible suppliers and we found one located in our country that accomplish the requirements and have constantly proven to be a trusty supplier, the second challenge was to develop the functionality of our product in such a tiny space, even though we had a hard time, applying the newest technology, we achieve to keep it as small as possible, the third challenge was creating the last prototype and that's why we are raising this campaign to make it to the last phase of the product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As people that have dedicated our time and effort and all our resources to this project, we will continue to face the challenges that might appear so we can see our product in the market and see the face of our happy customers faces, staying connected with their loved ones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course there are risks, the biggest risk is that our product doesn't satisfy our customers. That's why we can assure you that our product will be of the highest quality and we have developed different group controls to be sure that what we are offering is what our customers expect, we plan to keep a warranty system in case our customers detect a bad function in our product and replace it at no cost for our customers. (*warranty policy may apply) </p>
<p> </p>

<p>CordCondom is a revolutionary product that protects and repairs your existing charger cables. CordCondom does not require any additional tools or materials to be installed and the whole thing is applied in just a few seconds.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485372342/ogzg1u6zz1rlmqtqqlap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Who we are and what we stand for</h3>
<p>My name is Luca and I'm the founder of CordCondom, in the past year I have developed a team to help me bring what was a conceptual idea in my head into a real life product that is in use on thousands of chargers today. I was a student that faced the problem of my charger breaking almost every 2 months due to my on-the-go lifestyle so I started designing CordCondom as a way to solve my own problem. After applying it and going to a few lectures I found that my peers were taking notice and asking where I bought this product and where they could purchase one as they too were having this problem. That's when I knew that there was demand for my invention and I ordered materials for my first 100 units. I quickly realized that ordering materials in small amounts like this was very expensive and the price of the product was higher then I would like because of this. To keep the price affordable to customers, I realized that I would need to order in larger amounts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485464150/s76qqecg2g0mvrke9o2e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need your funding</h3>
<p>With many happy customers we are looking to expand our production by ordering more inventory and hiring some extra staff to help with manufacturing as the majority of it is done in house in our home city of Toronto Canada. Your funding today will help with the initial high costs of inventory and allow us to spend on costs associated with redesigning our packaging to make it more clean and minimalist while still providing a great first impression. Also we would like to invest in more marketing efforts as we believe our small company still has huge potential to grow further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our KickStarter success</strong></p>
<p>By running a successful <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1798141982/cordcondom-practice-safe-charging?ref=nav_search"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">kickstarter campaign</a> we were able to order materials in larger quantities which helped alot in terms of pricing. With your help today I am looking to grow the company even further and increase production abilities for CordCondom. Furthermore, when reviewing all comments you can see that all previous backers are now satisfied and there were no negative reviews of the product. You can also find that CordCondom handled all problems with shipping quickly and ensured that all rewards were delivered on time as promised in the campaign.</p>
<p>We have proven that we stick to our word and always underpromise and over deliver. We intend to continue this track record of outstanding customer service throughout our indigogo campaign and into the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>By backing us today you will receive your very own pack of CordCondoms to protect all your chargers.</p>
<p>If your charger is already beyond repair, you can grab a charger of your choosing as a perk and it will come with a CordCondom pre-applied.</p>
<p>After using CordCondom you will instantly see the added benefit of the additional rubbery grip feeling your charger now has. Also you will gain peace of mind that your charger will always be there for you and won't stop working when you are doing something important.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485464375/bmlrnzmnfari1t6yagx3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<div> </div>
<h3>Our competition</h3>
<p>There are many DIY projects that claim to strengthen charging cables and we've actually written a blog post for anyone who may not be familiar with them <a href=""https://www.cordcondom.com/new-blog/6-ways-to-protect-a-charger"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.cordcondom.com/new-blog/6-ways-to-protect-a-charger</a> we have put all of these methods to the test on our stress testing machines and found that none of them provide the additional strength and protection that CordCondom does. Not to mention some took quite a bit of time to apply.</p>
<p>We already have a functioning product for phone chargers with many happy users so you don't have to worry about whether we will be able to build out the product and get it to you. We want to be able to order in larger quantities and having pre-orders will give us the funding we need to put ourselves on the map in the crowded phone accessory market. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What does it fit on?</h3>
<p>We have designed a product that works on the Apple Lightning connector cable, Samsung Micro USB, Most USB-C cables and the Apple Magsafe 1 Cable (non Retina Display). This is one product that forms to all different chargers so there is no need to specify which CordCondom you need. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485373000/b2jofvkbm2lyjdarfzyr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This also makes it easy to share a CordCondom with a friend in need regardless of their device.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485457631/tlcriglahzz0arxflpk9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep your current MFI certified charger safe and stop purchasing Non-Licensed cords online or at the gas station that give error messages after updating your phone. (CordCondom is not an accessory that connects to your phone directly and therefore does not have MFi certification itself.) All Lightning cables available in perks are MFI Certified.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Allergy concerns</h3>
<p>For those of us who have to avoid latex products when being intimate, don't look for substitutes here. All our products contain no latex and are made from 100% silicone meaning a tougher product and no frustrating latex allergic reactions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485462208/tycvd4j9lirik4eygtd0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Is it difficult to put on?</h3>
<p>It's Easy! We managed to do it in under 15 seconds and it can be done anywhere as it requires no tools or small parts.</p>
<p>Here's Amanda applying it on her charger.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485462226/tdvjhfqeq9xvxbb9xysf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The environmental effect</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485457714/zv8pdi6yc8wqhxyfxjeu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Yes you read that right. The amount of waste caused by discarded chargers is TOO DAMN HIGH. </p>
<p>If we could put a CordCondom on only 1% of these chargers and double their usable life, we would have 3 Million less chargers in the garbage this year. </p>

</div></div>","CordCondom is a revolutionary product that protects and repairs your existing charger cables. CordCondom does not require any additional tools or materials to be installed and the whole thing is applied in just a few seconds.

 

Who we are and what we stand for
My name is Luca and I'm the founder of CordCondom, in the past year I have developed a team to help me bring what was a conceptual idea in my head into a real life product that is in use on thousands of chargers today. I was a student that faced the problem of my charger breaking almost every 2 months due to my on-the-go lifestyle so I started designing CordCondom as a way to solve my own problem. After applying it and going to a few lectures I found that my peers were taking notice and asking where I bought this product and where they could purchase one as they too were having this problem. That's when I knew that there was demand for my invention and I ordered materials for my first 100 units. I quickly realized that ordering materials in small amounts like this was very expensive and the price of the product was higher then I would like because of this. To keep the price affordable to customers, I realized that I would need to order in larger amounts.

 
Why we need your funding
With many happy customers we are looking to expand our production by ordering more inventory and hiring some extra staff to help with manufacturing as the majority of it is done in house in our home city of Toronto Canada. Your funding today will help with the initial high costs of inventory and allow us to spend on costs associated with redesigning our packaging to make it more clean and minimalist while still providing a great first impression. Also we would like to invest in more marketing efforts as we believe our small company still has huge potential to grow further.
 
Our KickStarter success
By running a successful kickstarter campaign we were able to order materials in larger quantities which helped alot in terms of pricing. With your help today I am looking to grow the company even further and increase production abilities for CordCondom. Furthermore, when reviewing all comments you can see that all previous backers are now satisfied and there were no negative reviews of the product. You can also find that CordCondom handled all problems with shipping quickly and ensured that all rewards were delivered on time as promised in the campaign.
We have proven that we stick to our word and always underpromise and over deliver. We intend to continue this track record of outstanding customer service throughout our indigogo campaign and into the future.
 
 
What you get
By backing us today you will receive your very own pack of CordCondoms to protect all your chargers.
If your charger is already beyond repair, you can grab a charger of your choosing as a perk and it will come with a CordCondom pre-applied.
After using CordCondom you will instantly see the added benefit of the additional rubbery grip feeling your charger now has. Also you will gain peace of mind that your charger will always be there for you and won't stop working when you are doing something important.

 
 
Our competition
There are many DIY projects that claim to strengthen charging cables and we've actually written a blog post for anyone who may not be familiar with them https://www.cordcondom.com/new-blog/6-ways-to-protect-a-charger we have put all of these methods to the test on our stress testing machines and found that none of them provide the additional strength and protection that CordCondom does. Not to mention some took quite a bit of time to apply.
We already have a functioning product for phone chargers with many happy users so you don't have to worry about whether we will be able to build out the product and get it to you. We want to be able to order in larger quantities and having pre-orders will give us the funding we need to put ourselves on the map in the crowded phone accessory market. 
 
What does it fit on?
We have designed a product that works on the Apple Lightning connector cable, Samsung Micro USB, Most USB-C cables and the Apple Magsafe 1 Cable (non Retina Display). This is one product that forms to all different chargers so there is no need to specify which CordCondom you need. 

 
This also makes it easy to share a CordCondom with a friend in need regardless of their device.

 
Keep your current MFI certified charger safe and stop purchasing Non-Licensed cords online or at the gas station that give error messages after updating your phone. (CordCondom is not an accessory that connects to your phone directly and therefore does not have MFi certification itself.) All Lightning cables available in perks are MFI Certified.
 
Allergy concerns
For those of us who have to avoid latex products when being intimate, don't look for substitutes here. All our products contain no latex and are made from 100% silicone meaning a tougher product and no frustrating latex allergic reactions.

 
Is it difficult to put on?
It's Easy! We managed to do it in under 15 seconds and it can be done anywhere as it requires no tools or small parts.
Here's Amanda applying it on her charger.

 
The environmental effect

Yes you read that right. The amount of waste caused by discarded chargers is TOO DAMN HIGH. 
If we could put a CordCondom on only 1% of these chargers and double their usable life, we would have 3 Million less chargers in the garbage this year. 
 
How did we test it?

Well, we call it the ripper. We built a charger destroying machine and recorded the difference in time before we saw charger guts coming out. An unprotected apple charger on this machine took only 5 minutes to be destroyed, with CordCondom applied it lasted over 12 minutes.

Future plans
We have fun at CordCondom and we're definitely not a ""one trick pony"". We have plans to release more colours and patterns along with cord protection for more devices. Headphones, laptops, computer mice etc. This is not just a product to us, but instead, a passion. We promise to do absolutely everything possible to ship rewards on or before our deadlines.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><strong>My name is William, the creator of the Tetherlock. My team and I have been working to create a device for the average person that can save them thousands of dollars in a little package. </strong>The Tetherlock comes with the ability to <strong>geofence your device</strong>, so you never have the opportunity to lose it. A year ago I was lucky to travel to Europe for two weeks, but I was unfortunate when I <strong>misplaced my phone,</strong> I watched as my contacts traveled down the dusty road on the tour bus. I created the Tetherlock so that <strong>people would not have to go through the pain and frustration </strong>that I did when I lost my phone, <strong>whether at home, in your daily routine around town,</strong> <strong>or like me, when traveling domestically or abroad.</strong> The Tetherlock can help to <strong>prevent theft </strong>as well because when anything,<strong> including your personal items</strong>, is stolen, you can have trouble getting it back. The most troubling part is, that if you get it back there is no guarantee that something hasn't already gone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>You can help us </strong>to make the product a thousand times better <strong>by allowing us to have resources</strong> to do so. <strong>We will add as many features as we have the funding for. Every dollar, or share, counts.</strong> Soon, we can give people <strong>another option</strong> to losing their personal items. By <strong>giving a little</strong> to this campaign, you can <strong>save yourself, and others, lots.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What it does:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tetherlock can come in multiple forms, including integrated into your case. It does not have to be modular.</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Tetherlock creates a geofence around your personal object</strong> (It doesn't have to be a phone). It also <strong>detects where you are within the geofence</strong>, and with this <strong>information sends a message to you when you leave the geofence</strong> ""protecting"" your device. All of these parameters are <strong>fully customizable</strong> with an app that you use from any computer. However this may be a basic idea,<strong> it can be expanded</strong> with the ideas from backers and the support they give us.</p>
<p>Our future plans can only be fully carried out with your help. Anything that <strong>you choose to contribute</strong> counts. We recommend that anyone who truly feels that they want to support the project<strong> share this page via social media (<a href=""https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20just%20found%20out%20about%20a%20new%20project%20on%20Indiegogo%20called%20the%20Tetherlock!%20https://igg.me/at/tetherlocksecurity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://igg.me/at/tetherlocksecurity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://tumblr.com/widgets/share/tool?canonicalUrl=https://igg.me/at/tetherlocksecurity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tumblr</a>)</strong></p>

<h3><u><strong>Short Summary</strong></u></h3>
<p>Attention, all memelords!</p> <p>Hello, my name is Benayahu Nissanian, and I'm a passionate meme consumer. Nowadays, there is a plethora of apps and websites with which to watch and look at memes. Memeify is here to revolutionize the way we consume memes.</p> <p>Memeify is an app where meme creators upload their memes and have them rated by the community. For every “star” the creator gets, they earn 0.1 MEMES. (MEMES is a new cryptocurrency that we’re developing alongside this app. The target value for every coin is 0.1 USD)</p>
<p>In addition, the app will offer a feature allowing you to donate to the meme creator whose content you enjoyed.</p> <p><strong><i>“As a bonus for our Indiegogo supporters, If you fund us before we reach our goal you will have access to the app before the launch and you will be able to become a meme creator <u>without an approval process!</u>”</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></h3>
<p>In order to develop the app, we will need 65,000 USD.</p>
<p>With that money, we will:</p>
<p>- Develop the Memeify app</p>
<p>- Buy servers for the app</p>
<p>- Launch a cryptocurrency coin called MemeCoin (MEMES) to go along with the app</p>
<p>- Market the app  </p>
<p>We have already spoken with several blockchain app development companies and we chose the right one for this project. Therefore, all we need is the money to start developing it.</p> <p><strong>Now it's your turn!</strong></p>
<p>You can purchase one of 6 perks to suit you. For every perk, we added a small bonus because we think our Indiegogo supporters deserve more.</p>
<p>When you fund this project, you reserve some MemeCoins (depending by the perk you buy) before the ICO (initial coin offering) with a free bonus. When we launch the wallet, you will get the coins you reserved along with the bonus (The Memeify app will have a built-in wallet).</p>
<p><strong>We estimate the initial app launch around summer 2019</strong></p> <h3><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></h3>
<p>The impact of this app will change the meme community as we know it. Today, meme creators have a hard time earning money from memes (oftentimes they don't even earn anything at all) so our vision is to make an app and a community where meme creators upload their memes and simply earn money from that.</p> <p>This will change the way we browse memes. We invite you to join our journey in hope of changing the meme community, together.</p> <h3><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></h3>
<p>The way we see it, our first and biggest challenge will be to get large amounts of people to use this app.</p>
<p>To overcome this obstacle we need your help to start this community and grow its popularity steadily so that more meme creators and meme consumers to join the app.</p>
<p>For this to work, all you need to do is to share this fundraiser and get your friends join our Discord server (we will send more details shortly). With your help, more people will join the community and the app will have a bigger impact in the near future.</p> <h3><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></h3>
<p>If you can’t help us fund this project, you can subscribe to our newsletter and get the latest news from the Memeify team.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Attention, all memelords! Hello, my name is Benayahu Nissanian, and I'm a passionate meme consumer. Nowadays, there is a plethora of apps and websites with which to watch and look at memes. Memeify is here to revolutionize the way we consume memes. Memeify is an app where meme creators upload their memes and have them rated by the community. For every “star” the creator gets, they earn 0.1 MEMES. (MEMES is a new cryptocurrency that we’re developing alongside this app. The target value for every coin is 0.1 USD)
In addition, the app will offer a feature allowing you to donate to the meme creator whose content you enjoyed. “As a bonus for our Indiegogo supporters, If you fund us before we reach our goal you will have access to the app before the launch and you will be able to become a meme creator without an approval process!”
 
What We Need & What You Get
In order to develop the app, we will need 65,000 USD.
With that money, we will:
- Develop the Memeify app
- Buy servers for the app
- Launch a cryptocurrency coin called MemeCoin (MEMES) to go along with the app
- Market the app  
We have already spoken with several blockchain app development companies and we chose the right one for this project. Therefore, all we need is the money to start developing it. Now it's your turn!
You can purchase one of 6 perks to suit you. For every perk, we added a small bonus because we think our Indiegogo supporters deserve more.
When you fund this project, you reserve some MemeCoins (depending by the perk you buy) before the ICO (initial coin offering) with a free bonus. When we launch the wallet, you will get the coins you reserved along with the bonus (The Memeify app will have a built-in wallet).
We estimate the initial app launch around summer 2019 The Impact
The impact of this app will change the meme community as we know it. Today, meme creators have a hard time earning money from memes (oftentimes they don't even earn anything at all) so our vision is to make an app and a community where meme creators upload their memes and simply earn money from that. This will change the way we browse memes. We invite you to join our journey in hope of changing the meme community, together. Risks & Challenges
The way we see it, our first and biggest challenge will be to get large amounts of people to use this app.
To overcome this obstacle we need your help to start this community and grow its popularity steadily so that more meme creators and meme consumers to join the app.
For this to work, all you need to do is to share this fundraiser and get your friends join our Discord server (we will send more details shortly). With your help, more people will join the community and the app will have a bigger impact in the near future. Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t help us fund this project, you can subscribe to our newsletter and get the latest news from the Memeify team. You'll be notified when we release the app to the public, so you will be able to download the official release as soon as it reaches the App Store or the Google Play Store. Another way you can help us reach the goal is to spread the word in social media in order to reach the funding goal.
And that's all there is to it!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Teachers will download the app to their mobile device.
Teachers will then add each of their classes to the app.
Each Class will have a unique code that is provided to Parents.
Parents download the app and add the class using the unique code.
During a School Emergency, the teacher will select the class they are currently in and alert parents if the class is ok.
Parents will receive the notification informing them of the emergency and letting them know the status of the classroom.
Current StageI am currently in the beginning stages and raising funds to help with the cost of developing. the I have found a great company here in California, located in San Fransisco that I will work with to develop the app.  Campaign TimelineOnce we reach our funding goal, the company will start the app development which should be completed in about two months.As soon as the funding goal is completed and the app has been developed (with some testing), it will be submitted to the Apple App Store.Ultimately we are looking at an August or September release.  Is this the final design?The app design pictured above will most likely change once the development starts, designs will be posted for supporter feedback. What will the App cost be?The app will be released on the Apple app store for $1.99.This will help us with future updates and cost to have the app hosted on an  AWS server.  Will there be an Android?The app currently will on be developed for the Apple app store. For us to be able to release the app for both platforms, our funding goal would have to be between $150k - $200k. If we are not able to raise that amount before the end of this campaign, we will create an another campaign at a later date. Risks & ChallengesThe first and most important challenge will be to fund this campaign successfully. If we can successfully reach our funding goal, the next challenge will be to get teachers around the country to use the app for their classes. It would be up to each teacher to use the app and also the school districts would allow them to communicate with parents during emergencies.  Check out on:

Puf is here to solve all those issues and many more.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our product brings elegance and technology together. We created the perfect case for one of your many problems. It looks like a normal case but it's so much more.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is it so special?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">First of all, our product is just 3mm thicker than your regular case, which doesn’t even feel different. That extra 3mm, offered us the opportunity to create the mechanism behind PUF. This includes the mechanism that makes the case work like a perfume bottle and the capacity of actually filling the PUF Case.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The mechanism includes a 10ml capacity which based on the average used by any person, it will last you a whole week and possibly more. Why 10ml you might ask?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">After extensive testing, we realised that it’s the perfect amount that will not only prevent the case from being too thick or too heavy, but also, the perfect amount to always have enough!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Never empty, never the same!</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Don’t worry... We thought of that too. One of the most unique characteristcs of the case, is that it is refillable.</p>

Don't you just hate it when you are in a rush and forget to put perfume on? Or how about the difficulty of carrying your favourite brand with you?How often did you forget your perfume at home? Puf is here to solve all those issues and many more.Our product brings elegance and technology together. We created the perfect case for one of your many problems. It looks like a normal case but it's so much more. 
 

Why is it so special?
 
First of all, our product is just 3mm thicker than your regular case, which doesn’t even feel different. That extra 3mm, offered us the opportunity to create the mechanism behind PUF. This includes the mechanism that makes the case work like a perfume bottle and the capacity of actually filling the PUF Case.
 

The mechanism includes a 10ml capacity which based on the average used by any person, it will last you a whole week and possibly more. Why 10ml you might ask?
After extensive testing, we realised that it’s the perfect amount that will not only prevent the case from being too thick or too heavy, but also, the perfect amount to always have enough!
 
Never empty, never the same!
Don’t worry... We thought of that too. One of the most unique characteristcs of the case, is that it is refillable.
All you have to do, is remove the lid of your favourite perfume brand and just place the case over the nozzle for literally, 10 seconds! It’s that simple!

 
 State your presence. Anytime, anywhere!
Running out of perfume and want to use another brand? Simple! As part of the packages, we include a non toxic cleaning product in its own small bottle, that allows you to clean the inside of the case, in order for a different perfume brand to take its place.

 How do I use it?

How well does your home know you?
Smart home technology can be overwhelming. Many of what we call ""smart"" or ""connected"" devices are not ""smart"" because these smart devices are disconnected from each other and do not have context. Besides, most smart products are merely glorified remote controllers and require commands to be issued from an app. Truly smart devices are those which are able to automate your life by making sense of your surroundings and your personal preferences.
With KLUG Home, it's easy! It's plug and play.

KLUG Home is a tiny USB smart home hub that connects with different smart devices in your home. Simply plug it into any USB port, and you're good to go. All the different smart devices you own are under a single interface. Control is easy via the KLUG app. 










KLUG integrates all your smart devices and makes them even smarter. 





KLUG Home supports all the popular smart devices, hubs and software in the market (NEST, SmartThings, Amazon Echo, etc). At this moment, a single KLUG Home can communicate with at least 20 devices. You don't need to pay exorbitant amounts of money to automate your home, we can make the simplest of smart plugs even smarter for you!




KLUG listens and responds to you.
KLUG not only supports control through a mobile app, but also seamlessly integrates with your favorite home automation systems like Apple HomeKit and Amazon Echo.








KLUG is small.
We've spent a significant amount of time perfecting our engineering and design prototype. With the size of a USB drive, KLUG Home can be plugged into and hidden behind your home's Wi-Fi router. With this form factor, you won't have to worry about where to put KLUG or have it disrupt the aesthetics of your home's decor.



Don't know where to start? Give our kits a try!




New to smart home automation? Don't worry, we have the perfect kits to get you started! And best of all, at a highly discounted prices! You're in for a treat!







What is KLUG Air? 

KLUG Air is an intuitive Air Conditioner controller. Installation is just as simple as sticking it on your A/C. Start remotely controlling any A/C, even the old dogs. KLUG Air comes with its own array of sensors, which continuously monitor and help automatically achieve thermal comfort in your room.
What can you do with smart plugs? You may ask.

KLUG Home can make even the simplest of smart plugs even smarter for you. Not only will you be able to remotely control your appliances (as any typical smart plugs would do), you will get a brain to automate their functions. 

In fact, with time, KLUG Home will recognize the types of device you connect your smart plugs to, and recommend ways to automate it as it begins to learn and create context. 

Here are some things that we love to automate our normal appliances with a smart plug.

Forgot to turn your lights? No worries.




Automatically cool off this summer.



Never miss a single day without coffee.




Monitor your electrical consumption.











KLUG Home not only provides a medium for your devices to add context to each other, but it also steers them to make meaningful decisions together.

So, how does our algorithm work?
Smart devices allow you to control them remotely. But what most devices currently lack is the notion of context. KLUG Home constructs this context by consolidating data from all your sensors to intelligently decide how to best coordinate your smart devices in order to achieve synergy across your entire home.








Taking the example of adjusting your air conditioner to a comfortable temperature. KLUG Home not only takes the usual humidity and temperature data from your air conditioner sensors, it also takes into account who is in the room, the external weather data, your personal metabolic rate, and historical preferences, among other data sources.

<h3>     eLeash : Don’t let your phone touch the ground! </h3> <p><strong>Our Idea:</strong></p>
<p>Smartphones are increasingly becoming more revolutionary. We have become more reliant on them for our daily use, to pay our bills, run our businesses, enjoying movies and even organizing events. With the high costs associated with their purchase, it makes sense to protect your phones from loss, theft, or damages. If you're not careful enough, severe damages may occur to your phone.</p>
<p>We want to revolutionize the way the world protects their electronic devices. We would like to introduce a device that connects the users with their device via reeling system technology (similar to retractable lanyard). It keeps your phone from falling on the floor and therefore your phone remains protected from damages or even scratches.</p>

<p>Over 50 million Americans break their phones every year by accidentally dropping. We found that it is inevitable even if it’s covered with a case.

<p>Our product is unique because there is nothing like it that already exists. Furthermore, it allows for customization so that you can show off your personality. It can be used by any age. It is so simple that even your grandparents can use it.</p>
<br/><br/> <p><strong>About eLeash</strong></p>
<p>eLeash is a shock resistant cover which keeps your device safe in case of collision. It uses a reeling system with Kevlar string and carbon fiber components that ensures durability. It will prevent your phone from ever hitting the floor. It also has a kickstand; a model with wireless charging capabilities. This technology can be used by anyone aged 13+. It can be held in your hand, clipped on your pocket or on a belt loop, etc. eLeash is reliable and safe and offers a lifetime warranty to the customers, which is indeed a cherry on the top!</p>
<p>eLeash will retail at $60. Price is really affordable which will give us a competitive edge over our competitors.</p> <p><strong>Budget:</strong></p>
<p>To successfully launch this unique mobile cover, we are looking to raise the sum of $50,000 to spend the money on prototyping, ensuring a quality product, and begin the manufacturing process of the product. </p>

<h3>                                      5GNetworkSites.com</h3>
<p>I'm Bill Brown from Raleigh, NC. In the early 2000's, I was involved in cell tower acquisitions for several telecoms in various areas across the state. Fortunately, I was successful in signing leases with many property owners. As you can imagine, they were extremely excited to become proud recipients of that monthly income for several years to come.</p>
<p>Now, dozens of telecom operators are deploying the new, high-speed 5G technology around the country. Later this year, SmartPhones with 5G service will become available in scores of US cities. But there is one important factor that makes this all possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5G data does not travel very far. So, in order to ensure acceptable reception, telecom operators are leasing properties and deploying small cell transceivers about every 250 meters. They are leasing thousands upon thousands of properties, both public and private, to which they can affix these devices. The telecoms are making monthly payments and signing 5-year leases with options.</p>
<p>In order to expedite the deployment of this new technological phenomenon, I'm seeking funding to develop, launch, and market this Site Aggregator website. It will benefit both property owners and telecom operators. More importantly, by enabling this 5G deployment, it helps to enhance the US economy and safeguards our national security. Additionally, it's the key element for IoT, the Internet of Things which will provide connectivity for billions of users, sensors, and devices.</p>
<p>Your minimum contribution of $20, will not only help 5GNetworkSites.com become a reality, but it will also entitle you, for no additional money, to membership in 5GNetworkSites.com. Then, you, too, can post your property information for possible selection as a paid small cell site location.</p>
<p>So, in a word, your $20 kills two birds with one stone. It supports my website funding, and it makes you an accredited member of the site once it is funded! </p>
<p>Please think about it. You could be doing both of us a favor!</p>

<h3>How Square One was born<br/>
</h3>
<p>Over the past three years or more I have been working hard day,
night, weekends and a little at a time to take SQ1 from concept to
creation. You may have heard the saying, “Oh well, back to square
one!” It's not by accident that SQ1 is named after such a popular
expression. What literally started out as a need to have my hands
free to type and Skype®, has evolved into a great idea packed with
new and exciting features and to be candid, Square One's timing is
now. Right now. 
</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442626987/aivyf2x77m6dzqadd7ff.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Creating a new electronic product can be complex, challenging and
require one to constantly re-think the process and ask, “Have I
done enough?” I believe so, however, I/we are determined to address
and resolve any unexpected challenges in an expeditious manner, to
ensure that SQ1 truly will become “The Ultimate Wireless Charger.”
We realize that there are several components to this design and all
parts must come together and work as one.  Our working prototype and
CAD files will work as a guide, for the required team of experts, who
will reverse engineer my work and remove certain risks from the
process. Therefore, extensive testing of all electrical components
and Qi® Wireless certification is required before, during and after
the manufacturing and assembly stages have begun.</p>
<br/><b>DESIGN ADJUSTMENTS</b><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As with all challenges associated with manufacturing, the biggest
one is unforeseen “changes”; from a conceptual prototype, to an
actual production ready finished piece. As a result, we may incur
delays from the manufacturing vendor. Other challenges to consider is
design compromise, adjustments and quality control. You have my word,
that I will not rush the process. My goal is to ensure that SQ1 is of
the highest quality and that our customers are loyal, not just
satisfied. I am in no hurry to just get SQ1 on the market.</p>
<b>MANUFACTURING &amp; PRODUCTION</b><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Creating the tooling and electronics, within a product like this,
is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it correct.
Creating the molds for this product typically is estimated to take
30-60 days, which is where delays may come into play. To minimize
that possibility, we're working with tooling manufacturers partners
with a proven track record for quality,trusted fabrication and
construction methods for electronic devices.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FULFILLMENT &amp; LOGISTICS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let's be candid, in life things happen that one could have never
planned for: suppliers may miss a deadline, supply shortage,
equipment failures or a shipment may get lost. Many of these real
world manufacturing scenarios could cause a delay. To minimize the
possibility of manufacturing setbacks, we will enter the
manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each
component. We will identify and have a back-up supplier on standby
who could step in and resolve any major/minor challenges during this
process. A tenacious project manager will be tasked to steer the
fulfillment process through all obstacles, which could potentially
cause further delays.</p>
<p>We will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience
delivering excellent products in large quantities. There will be some
surprises as we walk through together with you. All obstacle along
the road will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge and
passion, third party expertise and an overall goal of making SQ1 the
best for you and your family.</p>
<p>Remember any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.
Help us make Square One the industry standard for smartphone chargers
and devices. It is time to evolve again.</p>

How Square One was born

Over the past three years or more I have been working hard day,
night, weekends and a little at a time to take SQ1 from concept to
creation. You may have heard the saying, “Oh well, back to square
one!” It's not by accident that SQ1 is named after such a popular
expression. What literally started out as a need to have my hands
free to type and Skype®, has evolved into a great idea packed with
new and exciting features and to be candid, Square One's timing is
now. Right now. 


    
RISKS & CHALLENGES
  


Creating a new electronic product can be complex, challenging and
require one to constantly re-think the process and ask, “Have I
done enough?” I believe so, however, I/we are determined to address
and resolve any unexpected challenges in an expeditious manner, to
ensure that SQ1 truly will become “The Ultimate Wireless Charger.”
We realize that there are several components to this design and all
parts must come together and work as one.  Our working prototype and
CAD files will work as a guide, for the required team of experts, who
will reverse engineer my work and remove certain risks from the
process. Therefore, extensive testing of all electrical components
and Qi® Wireless certification is required before, during and after
the manufacturing and assembly stages have begun.
DESIGN ADJUSTMENTS


As with all challenges associated with manufacturing, the biggest
one is unforeseen “changes”; from a conceptual prototype, to an
actual production ready finished piece. As a result, we may incur
delays from the manufacturing vendor. Other challenges to consider is
design compromise, adjustments and quality control. You have my word,
that I will not rush the process. My goal is to ensure that SQ1 is of
the highest quality and that our customers are loyal, not just
satisfied. I am in no hurry to just get SQ1 on the market.
MANUFACTURING & PRODUCTION


Creating the tooling and electronics, within a product like this,
is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it correct.
Creating the molds for this product typically is estimated to take
30-60 days, which is where delays may come into play. To minimize
that possibility, we're working with tooling manufacturers partners
with a proven track record for quality,trusted fabrication and
construction methods for electronic devices.

FULFILLMENT & LOGISTICS

Let's be candid, in life things happen that one could have never
planned for: suppliers may miss a deadline, supply shortage,
equipment failures or a shipment may get lost. Many of these real
world manufacturing scenarios could cause a delay. To minimize the
possibility of manufacturing setbacks, we will enter the
manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each
component. We will identify and have a back-up supplier on standby
who could step in and resolve any major/minor challenges during this
process. A tenacious project manager will be tasked to steer the
fulfillment process through all obstacles, which could potentially
cause further delays.
We will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience
delivering excellent products in large quantities. There will be some
surprises as we walk through together with you. All obstacle along
the road will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge and
passion, third party expertise and an overall goal of making SQ1 the
best for you and your family.
Remember any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.
Help us make Square One the industry standard for smartphone chargers
and devices. It is time to evolve again.

<h3>Thermal Performance</h3>
<p>!nverse is designed such that all air intake holes are on the bottom. With fans drawing cool air in, positive pressure then pushes hot air exhaust out from airholes on all 4 sides.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/1sku81.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>

<p>To test if !nverse can handle the highest performance components, we tested !nverse with a Gigabyte R9 390 (the hottest graphics card in recent years) and an i5-4690K CPU overclocked to 4.4 GHz (as far as it'll go).The CPU cooler was a Cooler Master Seidon 240M while the graphics card has 2 x Silverstone FW121 case fans over it.</p>
<p>The graphics card was stress-tested with Unigine Valley while the CPU was stress-tested with prime95. Under these conditions, the maximum GPU temperature is about 80 degrees Celcius while the maximum CPU temperature (4-core average) is about 83 degrees. <strong>These temperatures are only about 5-8 degrees higher than if the components were tested in open air (no case at all to interfere with airflow).</strong> !nverse is not only the smallest case design that can house these components, but also one of the best performing.</p>

<h3>Dust Protection</h3>
<p>With every PC that's built to last, dust protection is an imperative. Excessive dust being inhaled into your computer can lead to heating inefficiency, preventing you from getting the best performance out of your PC. Furthermore, excessive dust build-up can lead to electric shorts on your motherboard, potentially ruining a PC that your spent lots of time and money on.</p>
<p>Every air intake area at the bottom of !nverse is surrounded by 4 screw holes, <strong>allowing the user to use any 120mm dust filter of their choosing</strong>. Take your pick between any magnetic or plastic dust filters; !nverse has you covered.</p>
<h3>Accessories</h3>
<p>Bundled with !nverse are the following accessories:</p>

<p><strong>Q: There are no exhaust holes on the top, only on the sides. Doesn't that go against ""hot air rises""? How would that impact temperatures?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The effects of hot air rising are negligible compared to the forces produced by fans. Please check out <a href=""https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Vertical-vs-Horizontal-Case-Cooling-89/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this article</a> for reference.​</p>
<p><strong>Q: !nverse supports AIO radiators with 240mm radiators and FEP tubing. Does it support 2 independent AIO radiators with 120mm radiators and FEP tubing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Possibly. I'll need to add 4 screw holes to the design, but it can theoretically work by having one radiator attached to the interior frame in the ""fan first"" configuration and the other radiator attached in the ""radiator first"" configuration. These 2 radiators will need to be attached side-by-side, and the tubing of the one in ""fan first"" configuration will need to make a pretty sharp turn, but it should fit. For this scenario, you'll need to remove the compartment divider.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to put stuff onto the !nverse case, but I'm worried it'll break. Hold me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Don't worry, I have put a 50"" TV on top of the !nverse case, and it's definitely capable of handling more.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does !nverse support custom water-cooling solutions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> !nverse is not designed to support custom water-cooling. However, after having spoken with many liquid-cooling enthusiasts, we think that it may be possible with some light modding.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Some prototypes pictures have 2 front USB ports while others have 1. Which is it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> The production model of !nverse will have 2 front USB 3.0 ports.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How does !nverse do on noise?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We don't have the equipment to objectively test the noise spectrum of !nverse. However, by the ""ear test"", we don't think that !nverse is any different from other metal cases in terms of noise.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did you drill all those holes on the prototype in the temperature test?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> That was one of the earlier prototypes. We wanted to test many different airhole configurations to figure out the best balance of thermal efficiency and aesthetics. The resulting airhole configuration is what you see today.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Does !nverse support internal optical drives?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> !nverse does not support internal optical drives.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will you offer !nverse with more color choices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We are working with our manufacturer to hopefully offer more colors.</p>

<h2>Native Features<br/>
</h2>
<p>In addition to 100% Native UI components, Wrist-View also uses other Apple Watch functionality, such as Complications, GPS Location, iBeacons, Handoff, Dynamic Type, Haptic Taps, Background Content Updates, Silent Push Notifications, etc.  These Native Features will be easy to take advantage of and will greatly enhance the experience of using Wrist-View.  <br/><br/></p>
<h2>Complications</h2>
<p>Despite the name, Watch Face Complications makes it extraordinarily easy to stay informed.  Using our Channel Server, Wrist-View receives updates based on a schedule you setup.  When something new comes in, it is sent to your Watch in the background and updates the Complication Timeline.  You can even configure it to give you a Haptic Tap when new info is available.  By tapping the Complication, you can go directly to the content details quickly and easily.</p>
<p>This means that no matter what channels you've subscribed to, be it in an RSS feed, Web Content, your own custom channel, etc., when new content is available it will automatically show up on your Watch Face.  No more checking multiple websites and multiple apps to stay up to date.  Wrist View keeps you informed with virtually no effort on your part.</p>
<p>Wrist-View also make the most efficient use of Complications.  Since Wrist-View collects content from many different sources (movies, news, stocks, etc.) it can use the same Complication to display many different types of information.  Other Apple Watch apps only show one type of information on a Complication.  </p>

<h2>Dynamic Type</h2>
<p>Apple Watch is a cool wearable device with a high resolution Retina screen. Trouble is, there is no one size fits all solution when it comes to things like the size of text to display.  Luckily, Apple Watch has this covered and Wrist-View makes it easy to use.</p>

<h2>Location Aware<br/>
</h2>
<p>Wrist-View will be able to use your GPS Location (if you allow it) and iBeacon Technology (if you allow it) to detect and alert you to content that is relevant to your current position.  This will let you get information about a commuter train delay when you pull into the station parking lot, lunch specials at a nearby cafe, or a discount at a coffee shop 2 blocks away.<br/><br/>There will be Channels to alert you of accidents nearby while you're driving, speed traps, red-light cams, and other Points of Interest.  We'll be able to bring new functionality to life just by creating a new Channel, which can be done in a day or two, not weeks or months to build an app from scratch.</p>

<h2>Harness the power of iBeacons!</h2>
<p>iBeacons is a great technology which allows you to detect Content indoors.  Wrist-View will be able to recognize iBeacons and alert users with a customized message.  This will help you find deals when you walk into a store, or find out about 'Coming Soon' attractions when you walk into a movie theatre.<br/><br/>If you own or manage a store or restaurant, Wrist-View is a great way to start using iBeacon technology quickly and affordably.  You'll be able to get deals and info into the hands of customers who walk into your store.  <br/><br/>With one iBeacon and a Channel for your establishment, you'll be able to connect with customers as they walk through your door.  You can offer them a deal when they walk in and say ""Thanks for coming"" when they leave.</p>

<h2>Where we're at</h2>
<p>As you can see from the videos and screenshots, we've made a great deal of progress in bringing Wrist-View to life.  Spending countless hours proving out the concepts we wanted to include, will help ensure we have a successful project.  All the screenshots and videos on the project page came from the Alpha version of the Apple Watch app.  Nothing was Photoshop'ed or mocked up, this is all the real deal.</p>
<p>We've also submitted the current version of Wrist-View to the App Store and it's been approved!  It's on developer hold so we can add some more features, so it's not visible in the store right now.  Getting the app approved is a huge plus since it significantly reduces the risk of getting the app into the App Store later when the final version is ready.</p>
<p>We have been able to successfully Channel the content of web-sites onto Wrist-View as well and ensure the Complications are showing updates as they should.  We'll be creating many more Channels to ensure that a wide variety of content is available. <br/><br/>What we need now is your support so we can complete the Apple Watch App, setup more Channels of content and bring the world a great new way to stay up to date and in touch.  Select your perk now, and let's make this happen!<br/></p>

When developing our first prototype we were just focused on proving the basic concept on a small scale, therefore the full product we’ll be developed with the MDK instead of the STM32F4 board and will connect seamlessly with the Moto Z through the Moto Mods interface connectors like all the other Moto Mods out there.What We NeedWe are a start-up and currently don’t have funds to further develop and mass produce the InstruMod.  In order for us to bring the InstruMod to the masses, we need to raise a minimum of $15 000 and this is how we're planning on spending it:If we are unable to reach our target goal, we will not be able to further develop our project because of insufficient funds and the possibility of not being able to fulfill perks. We still have more inventions we would like to share with the World so please support our campaign and help us innovate the World through our imagination.How to contribute
 You can pledge a contribution to our campaign by purchasing one of our unique perks which includes a pre-order of the InstruMod.
 If you just want to pledge because you really like this campaign and don't really want a perk, maybe because you don’t own a Moto Z smartphone, you can still  pledge any amount you’d like as a donation to our campaign. Just simply click the “Back it” button at the top of this page and make your contribution. All backers of the project will be given a shout out across all our social media platforms.
By being a contributor to our campaign, you are being part of a huge technological revolution taking place in South Africa and Africa at large where young innovators, such as us, are starting up small technology ventures that will hopefully grow in future to be one of the leading giants in this industry. Your involvement in this technology revolution is so priceless it cannot be measured by any perk.Our timeline The ImpactThe InstruMod offers the versatility of being able to measure more than one quantity, the convenience of always having your measuring tool set in your pocket everywhere you go and the accompanying Android application helps in documenting your project details as you are building it. If you’re working as a team, the InstruMod will allow sharing of project specifics so that everyone in the team is made aware of everyone else’s work.Risks & ChallengesThis campaign is as a result of our entry into the ‘Transform the Smartphone Challenge’ by Indiegogo, Motorola, Lenovo and Verizon. After receiving the news that our concept had been chosen to participate in the competition we only had about a month to prepare for this Indiegogo campaign and build a working prototype model. Being short stuffed we could only accomplish so much in a very short space of time. The project is however developing and on its prototyping stage.Before Launch we have already completed our first working prototype which just illustrates some of the features that the final product will have. Your contribution could help to speed up development and production by recruiting more Engineers. We are hosting the project on our webpage (sytechnologies5.wixsite.com/sytechnologies). This will allow you as the contributor to keep track of the project as it is being developed. This will also give you the rare opportunity of being involved in our product development, as you can leave suggestions on what is the best way we could approach this build and help us shape the project in the direction you feel will suite you best.Because this is your product, we would love to hear your suggestions on our Facebook and webpage. We will encounter problems in future, be it delays in development or delays in manufacturing but we will regularly keep all our backers informed. Our goal is to deliver the InstruMod, a first of its kind, to the world. We will do all it takes to reach this goal.Other Ways You Can HelpWe are active on Facebook please visit our Facebook page SY Technologies, please like the page and share our story with friends and family. We host regular weekend projects that we think you might enjoy. You can also use the Indiegogo sharing tools to tell everyone about us. Your support in helping us promote our campaign will be crucial in reaching our funding goal. The best way to support us is by backing us up. By doing that, you are part of a new technological revolution taking place in South Africa and Africa at large. Thank you!",17.0,6,"1 Campaign

This can be used for everything from business intelligence.    Product/Service Description  The way we shop has changed dramatically over the last decade with the explosion of online retailers and daily deal websites: and now it is enjoying its latest revolution in the form of iBeacon technology. 
Process

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication 
To understand how IBeacon works, it's important to first be familiar with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Bluetooth Low Energy is a network technology used to transmit data over short distances. BLE communication comprises of advertisements of small packets of data which are broadcast at regular intervals through radio waves. BLE broadcasting is a one-way communication method; it simply advertises its packets of data. These packets of data can then be picked up by smart devices nearby, which can be used for a number of applications to trigger events such as prompts, push notifications, and app actions.


Summary
When the market demand forecasts considered expected demand for Beacon Technology should be higher so expected Return on Investment.

<h3>What's In It For you?</h3>
<p>'The Catch' is not your ordinary phone case. It is a collection of phone cases for everyday use. </p>
<p>To offer just one phone model case takes a large initial investment. To offer an entire line of options would take closer to 1 million. We are  testing the market here with these new options, and hope to raise $100,000 in order to guarantee up to 10,000 orders of the Catch Case, offered  in 2 phone models; The iPhone X and the Samsung Galaxy Note 9...as these are the top selling phones.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have 3 unique designs, available in 2 phone models.  The more money we raise over this amount, means the more phone models we can offer, such as the IPhone 10R. Therefore, If we raise double the amount of money will offer these cases in 4 models, and so on. Staring with the most popular cell phone models. </li>
<li>If we do not raise enough to cover the most basic costs of providing the molds for a minimum order($50,000) we will refund the money. Otherwise all the money will be used to develop and market the phone case line while gaining research into the market and discovering what people want.</li>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""I was just in Shenzen at the world cell phone convention, I saw everything...but I didn't see anything close to these designs""! -Bruce Brown, the Plastic Czar, Advanced Plastics.</p>
<p>The cell phone industry is obviously going to grow and grow bigger and bigger. The cell phone 'case market' has an incredibly big market potential, but currently with very few creative options available. I believe we are due for a revolution in user friendly phone case options and trends and I believe the Catch is at the cutting edge of all this potential. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are testing the market with this new cell phone case line, to find out just how much interest there is. If we meet our goal there is no risk, but if we fall short, you will get your money back. We will still promote a powerful campaign based on the preferences we research, but there is no financial risk to you. </p>
<p>The number of mobile phone users in the world is expected to pass the five billion mark by 2019. China is forecast to grow from around 563 million in 2016 to almost 675 million in 2019. Around half of the Chinese population is projected to use a smartphone by 2020. By 2019, the number of smartphone users in the U.S. is expected to increase to 247.5 million.  We are also interested in investors. Please consider investing in our campaign towards equity in the company. We have perks available in $20,000 increments. Currently we are valuing the company so that $20,000 buys 5%. Once the campaign is over we can re-valuate depending on how many molds we are able to manufacture. </p>

wireless technology since its inception.  He has helped dozens of companies with
their products in the consumer, medical and industrial markets.  Now it is his turn, working with a fantastic group of experts in their fields!

The eNote platform is well on its way to being a real product.  We're already on our 3rd generation prototype, with tests including over 24,000 display write cycles on a single battery - simply phenomenal performance!  ePaper and Bluetooth Smart were made to go together.  There will be plenty of additional testing with your funding, but it is certainly on the path to being a robust and capable product.

What we have today:


Circuit design and PCB layout completed, prototypes built and working
Case design and prototype parts completed
RF tuning completed (and working great!)
Embedded firmware functional with some features still to be implemented.
Working iOS and iBeacon demo Apps

 We have several additional very exciting future features we'll accelerate if/when we exceed our funding goal.

eNote display Brief Specs



Bluetooth Smart (low energy) services: GAP/GATT, Battery, Device ID, eNote Display
ePaper display: 264x176 pixels, black/white

3.25 x 2.0 x 0.38 inches, 1.6 oz

0 - 50 degrees C

Sealed package with CR2450 620mAH battery, 3-5 years of normal operation (beacon + 2-3 writes/day)



To be qualified to: FCC, Bluetooth (testing and submission yet to be performed -  part of the campaign funding)
Note: the units supplied through the crowdfunding campaign may not have completed testing and certification by the time they are shipped.  These are development units.  Firmware upgrades will be provided as they are developed.



Product Risks & Challenges  We've done all we can to reduce risk on this project. We've prototyped, received quotations, and done design reviews with other engineers and production companies.  We're building these units on-shore in the US (as much as possible in Seattle) giving us direct connections with our suppliers. We have a small team of very experienced and successful people. 
That being said, there is always a chance that we won't be able to deliver on part or all of what we'd like. The current prototype units have not been fully tested to all of their specifications.  If the device is used differently from our models, specifications like battery life may come up short for particular applications.

This is a hardware project and small mistakes can cause rework with delays and disappointments.  Meeting FCC and Bluetooth qualification requirements may require changes and additional design and testing. 
The software is still evolving. 


   Other ways you can help bring eNote to the world Some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  
Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.  email, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, voice, US Mail.  They're all good, and it will all help. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>1. Do LumiLIFE robotic fish work in other aquariums?</b></p>
<p>No. Our robotic fish are uniquely built to receive power wirelessly from the LumiLIFE aquarium base only. Since it does not contain batteries, the only way the fish can receive power is from the LumiLIFE aquarium. The lighting, communication and control systems are built and programmed to function only within the LumiLIFE product.</p>
<p><b>2. What is the maximum number of LumiLIFE robotic fish that will work in the aquarium?</b></p>
<p>Although our current software and hardware are designed to allow for up to three fish,it is recommended to keep just one fish in the aquarium in order for the best display.We will be working on allotting for more fish to swim in the tank during next phase of our development.</p>
<p><b>3. Will there be other fish besides LumiLIFE’s Clownfish, Goldfish and Pufferfish variations?</b></p>
<p>Yes, definitely. Development of other variants of the robotic fish is very complicated and resource-intensive, but we will be working on creating other fish once the production of our current LumiLIFE product is finished. We have in mind the Anglerfish and Sea turtle, with the possibility of smaller fish in our next development phase. We would love to hear which fish you’d like to see!</p>
<p><b>4. I want to put more fish in the aquarium. Will there be a larger tank in the future?</b></p>
<p>We have made a prototype of a larger tank for testing and evaluation, but production takes considerable resources, time and requires separate regulatory approvals and certifications.</p>
<p>The LumiLIFE Aquarium we're presenting in this campaign will be best suited in almost all rooms and is the most popular according to a survey we conducted. For now, we are focused on producing this type of aquarium in order to give you the best possible experience.</p>
<p><b>5. I want to make my LumiLIFE Aquarium more special. Are there other base Deco Skin colors I can choose from other than the standard options?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We have more colors in development that will be made available for retail purchase in the future. We will likely include special editions of patterns and designs so that every LumiLIFE can truly be unique. Feel free to comment with the color you want, and we will make the ones that are most popular.</p>
<p><b>6. Does my LumiLIFE Aquarium come with a warranty?</b></p>
<p>The LumiLIFE Aquarium comes with a standard one-year limited warranty. The product should last several years, as it will be built with the highest quality of materials from, namely, Texas Instruments, Coilcraft, Dialog, TDK, Panasonic, and other major semiconductor manufacturers. Quality and customer satisfaction are of our utmost concern.</p>
<p><b>7. Will you ship to my residence?</b></p>
<p>Shipping to major markets, such as the Americas, Europe and Australia, will not be a problem as we are working to obtain regulatory approvals, compliance and certifications for the major markets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to logistical and cost issues, we will not ship the product to countries designated as high-risk areas, war zones or pandemic outbreak areas as defined by NATO Shipping Center, WHO and common courier services such as UPS, FedEx and DHL.

<p><b>8. When will I be able to purchase LumiLIFE in retail stores?</b></p>
<p>The LumiLIFE Aquarium will be made available at major U.S. retail chains and online stores once we have shipped the products to our Indiegogo contributors.

<h3><strong>What you get:</strong></h3>
<p>We have many cool perks that includes kits for your iPhone 7 and Apple device. Each package comes with the POWER AUX 7 that will ship in early March (Target is February, just need to have enough backers to get in the production line ahead of others). </p>

It is a digital and free tool kit making your life easier and allowing you to do anything you can imagine. Microchips, at 5 cents each, allow you to play enormous amounts of data while connected to a social media platform.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/bildkomposition.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Everything already exists in our digital lives, everything has already been invented. There is a social network for everything, there are solutions for our everyday lives. Something that does not exist, however, is the connection between the digital and the analog world.</p><p>crumds are small crumbs. These crumbs consist of so-called NFC-tags. NFC stands for “Near Field Communication.” They are small, electromagnetic transmitters and receivers. Such an NFC-tag costs but a few cents. Their storage capacity covers merely 888 bytes, which is 0.000888 megabytes, making them appear relatively uninteresting.</p><p><i>Our idea is simple. </i><br/>But our idea is revolutionary for all of our lives.</p><h2>Explanation Video</h2><div><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIBLsHl8maI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div>
<p>crumd uses a small memory capacity of just 888 bytes, simply for saving a variable link URL as a reference to your own user area on crumd.com. If you write or read a crumd with your smart phone, merely the path to <i><strong>something</strong></i> is read or written. With this simple technique we've created an open, free platform as a social connection of the digital and analog world. For everyone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/it's-just-a-path.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>“Whatever you can imagine.”</i> – That is crumd’s claim. Crumd is simply the open platform for your ideas. Users develop the possibilities themselves. Completely free and without limitations.</p>
<p><strong>crumd is not a closed system. Rather, it is like an open source puzzle comprised of many small crumbs. The whole cookie stretches as far as your imagination.</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/elements.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/baukasten-elemente.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Look at the <a href=""http://www.crumd.com/baukasten/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tool kit right here</a> on your smart phone by moving your device to the left or the right. You can search according to lists that have been pre-configured by other users or create your own and, if you wish to do so, make them open to the community.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>If you write — that is, tag — a crumd with your smartphone, the color scheme is red. Red as a metaphor for record, as in writing and recording. If you want to read a crumd by putting your smartphone close to it, the color changes to green, for the association with hearing, reading, listening.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/crumd-color.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>“crumd is the connection between the analog and the digital world. Small crumbs that make your real life and your digital life easier.”</i></p>
<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p>crumd works via simple lists. Simply create a list with your wishes in your secure space on crumd.com. You can attach images, videos, locations, and messages from your smartphone as well. These will be kept safe on the crumd server. Only you are able to determine who is allowed to read the crumd. Be it a boyfriend, a girlfriend, or after all the entire world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/crumd-the-next-social-network.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When your list of information or data such as videos, links, or locations is complete, hold your smartphone close to the crumd, in order to write it or look for other users’ lists via hashtags. There are crumds that are open for everyone and crumds that are bound to users within your list of friends. If you hold your smartphone close to the crumb, an individual message will appear after the read-out, which will lead you to the desired content. All list types and elements are individual components which may be mixed together by the user, such as a list element to check off, a list element with a copy tap-function, or a media element.</p>
<p><strong>The crumds themselves are crumbs, which also are made of individual crumbs. Just like Lego … You are able to mix together whatever you want. You can also begin by searching for a list via the hashtag and use it as a template.</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMH-1qE8J28?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
</div></div><h3>Example printer:</h3><p>Can't remember what kind of cartridge your printer needs? Simply stick a crumd — visible or invisible — on your printer, hold your smartphone close to it, and tag it with information about the printer right in place.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3T-pkKZnjPE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example selling:</h3><p>The best marketplace for your old stuff is real life. Stick a crumd on your scooter and tag it with information such as price, images, text, and your contact details. By being able to simultaneously save the geodata when tagging, it is very easy to view potential offers from the surrounding area in the marketplace of crumd.com without scanning a crumd. Someone walking past this scooter can scan the crumd and read the related offer. Thus, the whole world becomes your marketplace.</p><p><i>“It's just like eBay, but connected to real life.”</i></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOp-61oOi6E?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example fridge:</h3><p>You are out and about at the supermarket and have no idea what is still left in your fridge at home? On crumd, roommates can create a shopping list together. If something is empty, write it down. Contents may be queried right then and there or en route. And after your purchase has been sorted and put away, you simply reset the content. This way, you know what you have and what you are missing, even while you are on the go. If one of your roommates writes the crumd on the fridge, you receive a push notification, even en route.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/cfrWV8ZAF90?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example restaurant:</h3><p>You are standing in front of a restaurant, studying the menu and wondering if there is anything in here for you and how it tastes? The written menu will hardly make you any smarter. Simply watch the live videos and reviews of other guests. Even the owner is able to expand his menu by a sort of augmented reality. Restaurants are able to add a crumd to the display window or wherever they want and fill it with useful videos, reviews, and the current menu for example, or perhaps simply with an offer that applies only for that day. This way, users are able to digitally file all information on this restaurant in crumd's cloud. In their space, their social media portal from crumd.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSUNnzWy8mc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example adventure:</h3><p>View images, videos, and tips of other visitors, who have been there before you. Location-bound information is exactly where you currently need it to be. In a place where it might interest you right now. Digital information at a local spot, but not bound to locations; that is the solution we are looking for.</p><p>Enterprises in the surrounding area have the possibility to advertise for themselves and their products. This works quite simply. Enter a budget and pay comfortably via Paypal right then and there. You only pay if somebody actually views your ad and you are able to control, pause, expand, and adjust your advertising material while being en route as well. Comparable with Google AdWords, but in real life. When the budget is spent, crumd will notify you of it on your user profile and will show the crumd’s location as a little reminder.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LdmlMAPMkMA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example car:</h3><p>Search for a pre-made service pamphlet in order to leave some useful information for you, your customers, and other repair shops. A car part is always making the same problems in your vehicle? Then make note of it for others as well as for yourself. When the next user sees the crumd, e.g. on the inside of the engine cover, they will have all files, information, and tips at their disposal. Furthermore, it is usable digitally and online worldwide.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPdSKZp7nXo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/crumd-2gb.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Those who would like to have more than 2 GB per month can book additional space (similar to Dropbox).</i></p><p> </p><h3>Example data storage:</h3><p>Forget CDs, USB sticks, or hard drives. Select the data you would like to save on a small crumd and upload it to your own cloud. You have 2 GB at your disposal. How does it work? The NFC-tag’s 540 Byte serve as a link to your personal storage area on your crumd profile. Similar to a dropbox, you have access to your data from anywhere, but physically in an actual place as well. As part of a strong community, we gift 2 GB in storage space to each user.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ar_466c4WoU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example snap note:</h3><p>Leave a message for your family or friends. Once scanned the conversation is started and can be continued from anywhere. Don’t miss any new messages by activating push-notifications. Messages, photos and videos can be provided with a limited lifetime, similar to snapchat. You can also enable access for selected devices only. So the crumd always has to be scanned locally in order to reveal the information.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LrEryf8xRT4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example flirting:</h3><p>You like someone but are too shy to go and talk to them? Then convey only those pieces of information that you are comfortable sharing. Leave a tagged crumd on your crush’s car, scooter, or bike. Select first whether and what you would like to disclose. If they accept your flirt request, you will be able to see it via their crumd profile. This way you only give a response to exactly that one person, e.g. your phone number.</p><p><i>“It's connected to real life.”</i></p><p>Or you search for the right partner via a fact sheet. Enter your search criteria and find the person you are looking for. Controlling who gets to learn more about you is in your hands. You are able to see people in your area via the surrounding geodata. Creating a link to Tinder, or similar apps, is incredibly easy as well.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sWVp0fqA_8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example room:</h3><p>You have selected some nice things online for your bathroom or perhaps taken pictures of something you'd like to have while you were out and about? Beautiful things that would be a perfect fit? Then make a note of them right then and there. Either through your Pinterest account or as a simple link on a crumd in your bathroom. Update and share your ideas with others.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRXFx7smSUs?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example WiFi key:</h3><p>Write it down for yourself and others.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6LtqEJwWMQ8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example fitness:</h3><p>Set yourself tasks and goals for the gym, and keep track of your exercises and your progress in your fitness log. If you do sports at home, hold your smartphone close to the crumd. Depending on the day of the week that is saved on your smartphone, you will see what exercises await you today. If you are at your gym, you are even able to read about what you have to do directly from the training device via your account with crumd. Verification through your profile ID allows only you to see the information and data stored there for you.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zh-feFK7Fo8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example calendar:</h3><p>A family calendar with a reminder. You like analog calendars, but you do not want to miss out on the benefits of the digital world? Then simply do both. Read and write the crumd on your calendar from home or on the go. Feed your events with reminders. Live out your diary. Activate recurring events.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_Bczu238BQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example contacts:</h3><p>Exchanging contacts is very easy. No matter if a crumd is in your wallet, sticking to your phone, printed on a brochure, or located anywhere else. Simply let others read, save, and process your contacts.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMtbT-UL4Nw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example micro website:</h3><p>A more local enterprise does not need its own website. A local enterprise needs something faster: A crumd site with information, current promotions, and typical pieces of website info that are located right at the entrance. That way, passers-by as well as online users are able to get to know your company. Directly at the store, quickly writable, quickly updatable, and without any running costs. Your company website is included in your data contingent of 2 GB. Other users can also simply save your shop, including location and location features, which in turn can be used and forwarded.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3_5dDXXRgQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example voice memos:</h3><p>Voice memos on crumd. You are in a meeting and can hardly find your way through the paper chaos? Then record the meeting as an audio file and add the crumd with the recordings to your files. Pass them on.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2x4EQQeIIcY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example paying:</h3><p>Paying with crumd, e.g. for entry into a museum or zoo, spares you a long queue. Picture a crumd hanging in front of the cash register. You scan it and a Paypal payment request of the owner appears. After you pay online, a number is generated, a code for the sender and the recipient of the payment. You show it. Show it. If it matches the one from the cashier, you can get in immediately.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpNNLMKnyZ4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example movies &amp; videos:</h3><p>Share movie playlists with your roommates via Amazon or Netflix, stored via crumd directly on the TV. Create movie tips and watch lists for yourself and your family.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMRXLPi7OSk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example finder’s reward:</h3><p>Things that might be lost get a crumd with information on their owner and their direct contact details. It is possible to determine a small finder’s reward beforehand as well.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3nYZ0K0U89A?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example cook book:</h3><p>Tag an individual page in a cook book with information and data on that recipe.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwqUzY-0N5g?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.crumd.com/indiegogo/you-don't-have-to-scan-it-again.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Example digital donation:</h3><p>Send money to designated recipients in a quick and uncomplicated manner.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCd1mgGl0dk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Example backup:</h3><p>Use your crumds as a backup for your data. They are protected since only you have access to them with your device.

That way, others can inform you about important matters quickly and with very little effort. Function 2: Use crumd as a time-recording system. Every time you come and go, you briefly scan the crumd. The time data is saved in your profile as a clear list.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""100%"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XpFU3KhaOpE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h2>So a crumd can:</h2><p>1. be used by different users that will see different content according to their ID.<br/>2. contain multiple functions for you.

With the hashtag search you can discover exciting things about the world around you. Over the radar, you can find all crumd activities in the vicinity. You can follow crumds and other users and stay informed about your friends‘ activities. You can share, like, comment and even crumd without having tags of your own.</p><h2>iOS, the wavering obstacle</h2><h3>Technology:</h3><p>On devices with Android and Windows, the short-range wireless technology NFC is already up and running.

It is a digital and free tool kit making your life easier and allowing you to do anything you can imagine. Microchips, at 5 cents each, allow you to play enormous amounts of data while connected to a social media platform.Everything already exists in our digital lives, everything has already been invented. There is a social network for everything, there are solutions for our everyday lives. Something that does not exist, however, is the connection between the digital and the analog world.crumds are small crumbs. These crumbs consist of so-called NFC-tags. NFC stands for “Near Field Communication.” They are small, electromagnetic transmitters and receivers. Such an NFC-tag costs but a few cents. Their storage capacity covers merely 888 bytes, which is 0.000888 megabytes, making them appear relatively uninteresting.Our idea is simple. But our idea is revolutionary for all of our lives.Explanation Video

crumd uses a small memory capacity of just 888 bytes, simply for saving a variable link URL as a reference to your own user area on crumd.com. If you write or read a crumd with your smart phone, merely the path to something is read or written. With this simple technique we've created an open, free platform as a social connection of the digital and analog world. For everyone.

“Whatever you can imagine.” – That is crumd’s claim. Crumd is simply the open platform for your ideas. Users develop the possibilities themselves. Completely free and without limitations.
crumd is not a closed system. Rather, it is like an open source puzzle comprised of many small crumbs. The whole cookie stretches as far as your imagination.

Look at the tool kit right here on your smart phone by moving your device to the left or the right. You can search according to lists that have been pre-configured by other users or create your own and, if you wish to do so, make them open to the community.
Demo
If you write — that is, tag — a crumd with your smartphone, the color scheme is red. Red as a metaphor for record, as in writing and recording. If you want to read a crumd by putting your smartphone close to it, the color changes to green, for the association with hearing, reading, listening.

“crumd is the connection between the analog and the digital world. Small crumbs that make your real life and your digital life easier.”
How it works?
crumd works via simple lists. Simply create a list with your wishes in your secure space on crumd.com. You can attach images, videos, locations, and messages from your smartphone as well. These will be kept safe on the crumd server. Only you are able to determine who is allowed to read the crumd. Be it a boyfriend, a girlfriend, or after all the entire world.

When your list of information or data such as videos, links, or locations is complete, hold your smartphone close to the crumd, in order to write it or look for other users’ lists via hashtags. There are crumds that are open for everyone and crumds that are bound to users within your list of friends. If you hold your smartphone close to the crumb, an individual message will appear after the read-out, which will lead you to the desired content. All list types and elements are individual components which may be mixed together by the user, such as a list element to check off, a list element with a copy tap-function, or a media element.
The crumds themselves are crumbs, which also are made of individual crumbs. Just like Lego … You are able to mix together whatever you want. You can also begin by searching for a list via the hashtag and use it as a template.

 
Examples
Example printer:Can't remember what kind of cartridge your printer needs? Simply stick a crumd — visible or invisible — on your printer, hold your smartphone close to it, and tag it with information about the printer right in place. Example selling:The best marketplace for your old stuff is real life. Stick a crumd on your scooter and tag it with information such as price, images, text, and your contact details. By being able to simultaneously save the geodata when tagging, it is very easy to view potential offers from the surrounding area in the marketplace of crumd.com without scanning a crumd. Someone walking past this scooter can scan the crumd and read the related offer. Thus, the whole world becomes your marketplace.“It's just like eBay, but connected to real life.” Example fridge:You are out and about at the supermarket and have no idea what is still left in your fridge at home? On crumd, roommates can create a shopping list together. If something is empty, write it down. Contents may be queried right then and there or en route. And after your purchase has been sorted and put away, you simply reset the content. This way, you know what you have and what you are missing, even while you are on the go. If one of your roommates writes the crumd on the fridge, you receive a push notification, even en route. Example restaurant:You are standing in front of a restaurant, studying the menu and wondering if there is anything in here for you and how it tastes? The written menu will hardly make you any smarter. Simply watch the live videos and reviews of other guests. Even the owner is able to expand his menu by a sort of augmented reality. Restaurants are able to add a crumd to the display window or wherever they want and fill it with useful videos, reviews, and the current menu for example, or perhaps simply with an offer that applies only for that day. This way, users are able to digitally file all information on this restaurant in crumd's cloud. In their space, their social media portal from crumd. Example adventure:View images, videos, and tips of other visitors, who have been there before you. Location-bound information is exactly where you currently need it to be. In a place where it might interest you right now. Digital information at a local spot, but not bound to locations; that is the solution we are looking for.Enterprises in the surrounding area have the possibility to advertise for themselves and their products. This works quite simply. Enter a budget and pay comfortably via Paypal right then and there. You only pay if somebody actually views your ad and you are able to control, pause, expand, and adjust your advertising material while being en route as well. Comparable with Google AdWords, but in real life. When the budget is spent, crumd will notify you of it on your user profile and will show the crumd’s location as a little reminder. Example car:Search for a pre-made service pamphlet in order to leave some useful information for you, your customers, and other repair shops. A car part is always making the same problems in your vehicle? Then make note of it for others as well as for yourself. When the next user sees the crumd, e.g. on the inside of the engine cover, they will have all files, information, and tips at their disposal. Furthermore, it is usable digitally and online worldwide. Those who would like to have more than 2 GB per month can book additional space (similar to Dropbox). Example data storage:Forget CDs, USB sticks, or hard drives. Select the data you would like to save on a small crumd and upload it to your own cloud. You have 2 GB at your disposal. How does it work? The NFC-tag’s 540 Byte serve as a link to your personal storage area on your crumd profile. Similar to a dropbox, you have access to your data from anywhere, but physically in an actual place as well. As part of a strong community, we gift 2 GB in storage space to each user. Example snap note:Leave a message for your family or friends. Once scanned the conversation is started and can be continued from anywhere. Don’t miss any new messages by activating push-notifications. Messages, photos and videos can be provided with a limited lifetime, similar to snapchat. You can also enable access for selected devices only. So the crumd always has to be scanned locally in order to reveal the information. Example flirting:You like someone but are too shy to go and talk to them? Then convey only those pieces of information that you are comfortable sharing. Leave a tagged crumd on your crush’s car, scooter, or bike. Select first whether and what you would like to disclose. If they accept your flirt request, you will be able to see it via their crumd profile. This way you only give a response to exactly that one person, e.g. your phone number.“It's connected to real life.”Or you search for the right partner via a fact sheet. Enter your search criteria and find the person you are looking for. Controlling who gets to learn more about you is in your hands. You are able to see people in your area via the surrounding geodata. Creating a link to Tinder, or similar apps, is incredibly easy as well. Example room:You have selected some nice things online for your bathroom or perhaps taken pictures of something you'd like to have while you were out and about? Beautiful things that would be a perfect fit? Then make a note of them right then and there. Either through your Pinterest account or as a simple link on a crumd in your bathroom. Update and share your ideas with others. Example WiFi key:Write it down for yourself and others. Example fitness:Set yourself tasks and goals for the gym, and keep track of your exercises and your progress in your fitness log. If you do sports at home, hold your smartphone close to the crumd. Depending on the day of the week that is saved on your smartphone, you will see what exercises await you today. If you are at your gym, you are even able to read about what you have to do directly from the training device via your account with crumd. Verification through your profile ID allows only you to see the information and data stored there for you. Example calendar:A family calendar with a reminder. You like analog calendars, but you do not want to miss out on the benefits of the digital world? Then simply do both. Read and write the crumd on your calendar from home or on the go. Feed your events with reminders. Live out your diary. Activate recurring events. Example contacts:Exchanging contacts is very easy. No matter if a crumd is in your wallet, sticking to your phone, printed on a brochure, or located anywhere else. Simply let others read, save, and process your contacts. Example micro website:A more local enterprise does not need its own website. A local enterprise needs something faster: A crumd site with information, current promotions, and typical pieces of website info that are located right at the entrance. That way, passers-by as well as online users are able to get to know your company. Directly at the store, quickly writable, quickly updatable, and without any running costs. Your company website is included in your data contingent of 2 GB. Other users can also simply save your shop, including location and location features, which in turn can be used and forwarded. Example voice memos:Voice memos on crumd. You are in a meeting and can hardly find your way through the paper chaos? Then record the meeting as an audio file and add the crumd with the recordings to your files. Pass them on. Example paying:Paying with crumd, e.g. for entry into a museum or zoo, spares you a long queue. Picture a crumd hanging in front of the cash register. You scan it and a Paypal payment request of the owner appears. After you pay online, a number is generated, a code for the sender and the recipient of the payment. You show it. Show it. If it matches the one from the cashier, you can get in immediately. Example movies & videos:Share movie playlists with your roommates via Amazon or Netflix, stored via crumd directly on the TV. Create movie tips and watch lists for yourself and your family. Example finder’s reward:Things that might be lost get a crumd with information on their owner and their direct contact details. It is possible to determine a small finder’s reward beforehand as well. Example cook book:Tag an individual page in a cook book with information and data on that recipe.  Example digital donation:Send money to designated recipients in a quick and uncomplicated manner. Example backup:Use your crumds as a backup for your data. They are protected since only you have access to them with your device. Furthermore, unlike with analog storage methods, your data can be stored for eternity. Example social:Similar to Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook, crumd offers all possibilities which you are accustomed to through social networks. Subscribe to people, follow them, or follow individual crumds that you like. The example of multi lists:Create a number of functions on one and the same crumd and switch back and forth between the functions. For example function 1: a predefined question with a response option. That way, others can inform you about important matters quickly and with very little effort. Function 2: Use crumd as a time-recording system. Every time you come and go, you briefly scan the crumd. The time data is saved in your profile as a clear list. So a crumd can:1. be used by different users that will see different content according to their ID.2. contain multiple functions for you. You can always reset the master between the crumd and any function.All of this is possible on the same crumd for only 5 cents and you can create it yourself.“The possibilities are endless; we could show you another million examples.”And what are your ideas?Send us your idea. We will post all user ideas here on Kickstarter. Socialcrumd offers the typical social media features.FollowWebsite owners are able to offer a follow button. That way, users can see their public crumds in a timeline, similar to the way it is on Instagram or Facebook, and they can follow them.ShareWebsite owners are able to offer a share button. That way, you can share the information from your website on your own crumd.PinAll crumbs and all crumds can be collected virtually, similar to Pinterest.LoginSocial login via crumd.Even without crumds you can access its advantages. With the hashtag search you can discover exciting things about the world around you. Over the radar, you can find all crumd activities in the vicinity. You can follow crumds and other users and stay informed about your friends‘ activities. You can share, like, comment and even crumd without having tags of your own.iOS, the wavering obstacleTechnology:On devices with Android and Windows, the short-range wireless technology NFC is already up and running. This technology is also a fixed component on Apple's iPhone or iPad in the iOS 11 to be released in the fall of 2017. Summarycrumd has parallels with and connecting points to many systems and links them with your ideas and the actual, real world.“Bring them all together.“

There are already certain redundant solutions here, just like the dog toilet idea (http://www.stadtzeitung.de/schwabmuenchen/lokal...). It is crumd’s goal to replace these hundreds of different standalone-solutions with a single portal. One app, one solution.CostsNo costs for users; the portal is free and available to everyone worldwide.Only the crumd tags themselves cost a few cents apiece and can be ordered online through crumd.com. People who only wish to read do not need any crumds. As a long-term goal, we aspire to provide a fixed free contingent of crumds for each user. These crumds are supposed to be manufactured from natural materials. Materials that are both weatherproof and environmentally friendly. Seed money is needed forPoint 1: Development of the online portal and its Android and iOS apps. Point 2: Costs of the NFC-tags. Point 3: Costs of the free packages (incl. shipping costs) for distribution and the creation of a community. Point 4: Marketing measures, especially via Facebook, YouTube, and online press work. Each and every user receives a free starting package upon registration.Point 5: Foundation of a private or public liability company.It is an open, independent, and free platform. Open for everyone and everything. Each and every person is able to realize their own individual ideas with these components.concept paper (EN)concept paper (DE)Packages #lifewallThe #lifewall is an exclusive Ontop feature.

Something that looked, and felt great in both our hand, and our pocket, but was still rugged enough to tackle the obstacles of everyday life.And that’s exactly what we did, we created the new Minimalist Premium iPhone case!  Combining the best of both worlds with an elegant design that protects both your phone, and your budget, we’d like to introduce the ZAR Minimalist iPhone Case.It’s inevitable-- everyone is going to drop their phone eventually.With the ZAR iPhone Case, you’re allowed peace of mind, knowing that when the day comes, you’ll be prepared.Through various testing, and prototyping, we’ve developed a premium iPhone case at an affordable price. Be one of the first to receive an iPhone 7 case in the ZAR Minimalist design.We wanted to make the slimmest case possible, offering you an experience like no other. Now, there’s no need to sacrifice looks for protection. With the ZAR Minimalist Case, your iPhone will look amazing, feel amazing, and protect amazing.We went with a minimal design, taking little away from your phone, while still adding a whole lot of protection.Our case highlights the beauty and elegance of the iPhone, adding to the experience while keeping your phone safe.We wanted a slim case that was as sleek as possible. A case that feels good in your hand, as well as in your pocket.The smooth designs allows for a seamless transition from your pocket to your hand, while our eco-synthetic leather provides plenty of grip, keeping your phone secure. Easy snap on installation When crafting the ZAR Minimalist iPhone Case, we wanted to make sure our materials would be durable enough for everyday wear, but still feel nice enough to keep on our phone everywhere we go.We use a lightweight plastic internal frame with a soft textured synthetic lining on the inside that helps absorb impacts. The exterior of the Minimalist case uses premium, eco-synthetic leather that complies with universal stewardship standards, helping preserve wildlife.We know you’ll absolutely love the feel of your case, anywhere you go. Aside from feeling great, our leather also provides water resistant shielding, making sure your phone stays protected, even in the rain. Designed with you in mind-- The ZAR Minimalist Case is for the adventurer, the professional, and the minimalist. Simple design doesn’t take away from the beauty and complexity of the iPhone Synthetic leather skin for your phone's protection Our case fits well with any screen protector and gives 360 degree protection for your iPhone. With the ZAR Minimalist Case you can rest assured that your phone is protected. With our state of the art material blend, we’re confident the ZAR case will serve your needs for many years to come, in fact we are so confident in the quality of our cases that we will offer a lifetime warranty against any manufacturing defects.Comparison of our Minimalist case versus Apple's leather and silicone case, cases were heavily used for approximately 2-3 months in every condition imaginable. The Apple leather case had significant wear on the edge and had stains from being exposed to sweaty and wet hands. The Apple silicone case started to peel around the edges and had silicone chip off at the corners from being put in and out of pockets. Our Minimalist case on the other hand looked just as new as it did from day one. The picture below says it all!Our wrap around design ensures that your phone is covered from all angles, leaving no spot left behind. With each corner covered, your phone will be elevated when facing downward, protecting your screen from any scratches. Keep your phone blemish free, and get rid of those annoying greasy fingerprints that make your phone look gross.Our Minimalist Case doesn't stain and fingerprints comes off with a simple wipe.All our cases come equipped with premium eco-synthetic leather that grips 30% more than standard leather cases.

<p>We offer FREE shipping in Australia, please add the shipping fees (refer to perks detail) for shipping outside of Australia. We will be using regular shipping to dispatch your perks. Tracked or Insured shipping are extra and highly recommended and can be paid once the campaign finishes. The amount will depend on the weight, value of the reward and destination. </p>
<p>Unlike other projects we don’t make this fee mandatory. This allows the project to be accessible to budget conscious backers and other countries where tracked shipping can be very expensive. It's up to the backer to decide the level of service and risk they are comfortable with. We believe this is the best method, as it gives the backers a higher degree of control over the shipping options.</p>
<p><b>We have every intention of shipping your perks during the month of June.</b> We will do everything in our power to expedite fulfillment, and if all goes well we could be sending out the products even earlier.

<h3>1st Social App Against Mass Shootings, Terrorism and Other Crimes!</h3>
<p>Vigilantes is unique as it is the first attempt to use the power of the social media like never before with the main purpose to keep us all safe and stay connected with our loved ones.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For first impression you can download the Android beta version with<strong><i><u> </u></i><u>limited functionalities</u><i><u> </u></i></strong>on Google Play by clicking the icon below:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ja.vigilanti"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519566844/hynw3jh8n6bj41idgzj4.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>

<p><strong>Let us start with some good news:</strong> Did you know that if the world stands together as a community, we can defeat terrorism, mass shootings and other crimes?</p>
<p>The call for smarter ways to fight terrorism, mass shootings and other crimes has never been more important with famous world leaders encouraging the world at large to find better and innovative approaches in dealing with this menace. As Barack Obama famously said:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519497576/rzmik0pqn9u57flaumta.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That is why we created Vigilantes, a social mobile application to fight terrorism, mass shootings and other crimes. In fact, Vigilantes uses the eyes and ears of every user to help you stay safe. Imagine a thousand eyes and ears watching over you. That is what Vigilantes is for.</p>
<h3>How Vigilantes Works!</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519247258/vnjsnw0povxsrimg5uru.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>With Vigilantes you are never alone anymore.</strong> That is because you are connected to the largest community of safety conscious people on the planet. By uploading posts of events you see happening around you, you are contributing massive information, that helps others around you to stay safe in real-time.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518946138/qz0nqnyhjwdkqlimji9n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Vigilantes, rounds up all the information shared by users of the community in real time and give you safety alert reports of your current location, even suggesting to you safer areas in your vicinity. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519065805/y6oxvtuv0m7mo1ldkyfb.jpg"" src=""""/>Vigilantes also informs you in real-time of the safety of your friends, loved ones (children, husband, wife, father, mother, son, daughter, other relatives). Even Vigilantes situation awareness reports update in real-time. With our facial recognition feature Vigilantes will be able to detect criminals and notify law enforcement, of course with your permission.</p>
<p>The basic principle is simple: Before during or after an event occurs, a Vigilante around the event uploads a post on the map, at the same time people around the event are alerted to stay safe (see figure below).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519070284/cvxtbqomkhjtp2gxnift.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Did you know? </strong>There has been so many terror attacks since the last 20 years, not leaving out  mass shootings which are gradually becoming the norm in our societies these days. In America alone, the 3 of the worst mass shootings have happened within the past 6 months. The map below shows the hot spots of terror activities from all over the world.<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.de/global-terrorist-attacks-past-20-years-in-maps-2017-5?r=US&amp;IR=T#/#1997-suicide-bombings-in-israel-killed-more-than-a-dozen-people-and-injured-more-than-150-bombings-also-took-place-in-sri-lanka-and-egypt-a-shooting-took-place-in-india-killing-23-and-injuring-31-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519248607/pighezybxp3eqkoxigxt.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>

<p>In the scenarios today, a terror attack or mass shooting is easily executed by the perpetrators,  and mostly only after the attack has occurred, is the law enforcement notified. But with Vigilantes the scenario completely changes in favor of the innocent people and the attacks can be prevented.</p>

<p>Though Vigilantes focuses mainly on crimes, <strong>natural disasters also pose a great threat to human safety.</strong> So, Vigilantes integrates this aspect to warn users when there are events such as earthquakes or  weather storms like Hurricanes, cyclonic storms etc. The map below shows the distribution of natural disasters all over the globe.</p>

<p>In 2017 Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands and parts of the US, not to talk of Hurricane Katrina that devastated New Orleans and others areas. Hurricanes have been of common occurrence throughout the past years with many loss of life just because rescue teams could not locate and rescue victims in time. But with Vigilantes, victims just needs to pin their location on the map and rescue teams can get their precise location.</p>

</div></div>","1st Social App Against Mass Shootings, Terrorism and Other Crimes!
Vigilantes is unique as it is the first attempt to use the power of the social media like never before with the main purpose to keep us all safe and stay connected with our loved ones.
For first impression you can download the Android beta version with limited functionalities on Google Play by clicking the icon below:


Let us start with some good news: Did you know that if the world stands together as a community, we can defeat terrorism, mass shootings and other crimes?
The call for smarter ways to fight terrorism, mass shootings and other crimes has never been more important with famous world leaders encouraging the world at large to find better and innovative approaches in dealing with this menace. As Barack Obama famously said:

That is why we created Vigilantes, a social mobile application to fight terrorism, mass shootings and other crimes. In fact, Vigilantes uses the eyes and ears of every user to help you stay safe. Imagine a thousand eyes and ears watching over you. That is what Vigilantes is for.
How Vigilantes Works!

With Vigilantes you are never alone anymore. That is because you are connected to the largest community of safety conscious people on the planet. By uploading posts of events you see happening around you, you are contributing massive information, that helps others around you to stay safe in real-time.
Vigilantes, rounds up all the information shared by users of the community in real time and give you safety alert reports of your current location, even suggesting to you safer areas in your vicinity. Vigilantes also informs you in real-time of the safety of your friends, loved ones (children, husband, wife, father, mother, son, daughter, other relatives). Even Vigilantes situation awareness reports update in real-time. With our facial recognition feature Vigilantes will be able to detect criminals and notify law enforcement, of course with your permission.
The basic principle is simple: Before during or after an event occurs, a Vigilante around the event uploads a post on the map, at the same time people around the event are alerted to stay safe (see figure below).


How Terror Attacks/Mass Shootings can be Prevented with Vigilantes 

Did you know? There has been so many terror attacks since the last 20 years, not leaving out  mass shootings which are gradually becoming the norm in our societies these days. In America alone, the 3 of the worst mass shootings have happened within the past 6 months. The map below shows the hot spots of terror activities from all over the world.

In the scenarios today, a terror attack or mass shooting is easily executed by the perpetrators,  and mostly only after the attack has occurred, is the law enforcement notified. But with Vigilantes the scenario completely changes in favor of the innocent people and the attacks can be prevented.




How Other Crimes can be Prevented with Vigilantes 

Crime is an ever growing menace in our societies today. A smart an intelligent way is needed to tackle this growing menace. The map below shows the spots where there has been criminal activity only for the past year alone.


In the scenarios today, crimes are easily executed by the perpetrators,  and mostly only after the crime has occurred, is the law enforcement notified; But with Vigilantes the scenario completely changes in favor of the innocent victims and the crime can be prevented before it even occurs.




How Vigilantes can Assist Victims of Natural Disasters

Though Vigilantes focuses mainly on crimes, natural disasters also pose a great threat to human safety. So, Vigilantes integrates this aspect to warn users when there are events such as earthquakes or  weather storms like Hurricanes, cyclonic storms etc. The map below shows the distribution of natural disasters all over the globe.


In 2017 Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands and parts of the US, not to talk of Hurricane Katrina that devastated New Orleans and others areas. Hurricanes have been of common occurrence throughout the past years with many loss of life just because rescue teams could not locate and rescue victims in time. But with Vigilantes, victims just needs to pin their location on the map and rescue teams can get their precise location.




Why Choose Vigilantes!

Vigilantes is a social platform, so it offers the basic social media functions like Chat, Post Upload, Like, Share etc.  Vigilantes is unique because it  connects you with your friends, family and tracks what is happening around you in real-time and keeps you updated.

Uploading a post, your family and friends get notified immediately as well as the people around you. Imagine a shooter on rampage in the streets and you get notified to find shelter and stay safe!

 
Connects you to local emergency services: In case of an emergency, were someone is hurt, or people need rescue, Vigilantes connects you to the local emergency services with just a push of a button. It automatically detects your location (country, city, town) and pops up the right emergency numbers and local emergency facilities around you.

<h3><strong>How does it work?</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Xpot could reduce the amount of time we spend looking for parking, reduce traffic congestion in your city, and reduce vehicle emission pollution in cities, by 3-5%. That's a huge win-win-win. It's simple, but powerful.</li>

We believe that the pleasure of driving should not depend on whether you have a standard car or a sports supercar, in DataCar™ we are gamifying the driving experience to make it more efficient, safe and fun from any car.
ALL MOTORSPORT ASSISTS RIGHT FROM YOUR PHONE:

Real-time performance information
Intelligent gear shift indicator
Current gear
Speed
Temperatures
G forces

Feel like you are in a race car, you will not want to get off your car

You are driving and suddenly you see that you have 1/4 of gas, it is time to enter saving mode: activate the ECO MODE function and your display becomes an intelligent computer whose main function is to make you save gasoline.

Let the action begin
In real time, you will see visual and auditory alerts that you will have to follow to reach your savings goals. These alerts are your co-pilot who will tell you what to do; follow the instructions and you will get positive points, the higher the score, the greater the savings in real life.



Gamifying the driving experience means playing a video game with the most advanced video game console of all: your car.



 



We don't mean a virtual car, you´ll race from your own car! Let's be honest, street racing is fun, but also illegal and dangerous. With DataCar™ you'll have all the adrenaline, fun and passion of street racing in a safe way.
Feel the adrenaline in every race
Go to a safe place and do a drag race, then you can race against anyone without being in the car.

Every race has been recorded from real cars and real people, compare and bet against your friends or similar cars. Compare performance or just bet for fun. Run as many races as you wish, compete with as many racers as you'd like. It's legal and won´t wear out your car!

 Embark the efficiency of a true dyno inside your car!Measure your real engine power and torque within a 2% margin by performing a simple acceleration with your car!Make sure your tunings are effective using a completely objective and independent way, without any excessive expense!Is your Check Engine Light on?

In noncapital cases involving lesser offenses, prosecutors and judges sometimes force defendants to plead guilty before receiving counsel to move them through the system. In addition, the American Bar Association noted the justice system lacks the basic accountability and oversight needed to ensure decent legal representation or correct these problems.
LawyerUp is an app created to connect those in need of legal representation with highly-qualified lawyers.
​In light of the recent protests surging across America and throughout the world, lawyers have taken to social media in hopes to provide aid activists that may benefit from pro bono legal services.
