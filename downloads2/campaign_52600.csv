<h2>How HAMAC achieves this</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Automatic grind</h3>
<p>It ensures consistent grinds. Consistency produces uniform coffee grounds which encourages the best extraction of volatile flavors and aromatics trapped inside every coffee bean¹. Manual grinders are always stuck with poor grind uniformity. By automating a manual grinder, similar to expensive electric grinders, HAMAC provides uniform and precise grinds to contribute even size.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Perfect Low Speed</h3>
<p>Conventional electric machines, especially those with lower prices running at higher rotation speeds, can cause a lot of friction which results in overheating or oxidizing the beans. This ultimately degrades the flavors and causes static problems. HAMAC is designed to simulate a comparable hand grinding speed of 30 RPM² so that only minimal heat builds up and is transferred to the coffee beans. Every coffee bean has hundreds of flavors and aromatics looked¹. HAMAC releases the full flavor and aromatic potential in every cup of coffee, making your coffee delicious.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Simple Operation</h3>
<p>Same as electric coffee grinders, it simply requires a push of the button to start HAMAC. It is a convenient &amp; simple way to prepare a cup of great coffee. Grinding coffee by hand for a single cup is easy but tiring and time consuming for a group of people, especially if you want fine grinds.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Weight and Size</h3>
<p>We have designed HAMAC so that you can hold it with one hand and can take it anywhere. HAMAC’s light-weight of 350 g combined with dimensions of 144*53*61 mm makes it easy to travel with. Slip it into your backpack or luggage and everything you love about great coffee can be enjoyed anywhere.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Continuous Refinements</h3>
<p>Most affordable electric coffee grinders are too fast to burn the beans and those quality electric burr grinders cost hundreds or even sometimes thousands to spend. Through continuous refinements of materials, processes, and performance, HAMAC yields the same consistent grind size at a small fraction of the price of electric burr grinders. </p>

<h2>Why Develop HAMAC?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>All of our team members are passionate about coffee and its culture but unhappy like other coffee lovers with the problems of both current manual and electric coffee grinders. We set out to handle what we consider to be the key failures of most hand and electric grinders available today. Thanks to our team, we have worked out a revolutionary device, HAMAC. It benefits coffee enthusiasts both the attributes of manual and electric grinders. It’s about helping everybody make better coffee with fewer unknowns in the equation.</p>
<p>Our design objectives: HAMAC has both the benefits of manual and electric grinders- consistent grinding, hand grinding speed, convenient, portable, hand grinding speed, compact and lightweight.</p>
<p>We need your help to start and to make HAMAC a reality. Support us by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button below. We’re thrilled to have you on this journey. By backing and sharing our campaign we will be able to fund the initial molding, tooling, materials, and production of the HAMAC Energizer.</p>

<h2>Our Long Journey</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>1. Proof of Concept and Functionality</p>
<p>a. Research and test current manual and electric grinders:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564800310/wu713ckpbljkywphyyw3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>b. Test and analyze the functionality of gear motors: Test the speed, weight, and torque of 10       RPM, 30RPM and 80RPM gear motors to determine the most efficient in the balance of size, weight, and function. 30 RPM has been chosen accordingly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564653539/tzzknckzflq6x5vg9uod.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>2. Make, test and analyze the prototypes for functional and appearance improvements:</p>
<p>a. Dimensions and materials of the housing: ABS?<br/>b. Dimensions and materials of powder cover: ABS? Silicone?<br/>c. Grinding time: within 4 minutes for 30g?<br/>d. Noise levels: below hand grinder level 70?<br/>e. Arrange 3D print models based on the dimensions of drawings.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564809562/tw50earo61uteyi8yoht.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>f. Final prototype performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grinding time: 4 minutes for 40g</li>
<li>Weight: 350g</li>
<li>Size: length 145mm/height 60mm/width 53mm</li>
<li>dB level: 65-67</li>
<li>Housing: ABS plastics for its great resistance to heavy use and adverse environmental conditions.</li>
<li>Powder Cover: Silicone rubber for its excellent resistance to extreme temperatures he tensile strength, tear strength, elongation, and compression.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Planned to use injection molding for housing. Based on the refinements of prototypes, we have finished the CAD files.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564809433/ttuik2rifmyh32kwv4rf.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>What you see here is a fully functional pre-production model. It is close to the final product except for housing refinements.</p>
<p>As with any hardware project, there are natural risks and challenges in engineering and manufacturing. We've done a lot to minimize risks for backers: We have completed generations of prototypes that have demonstrated all the key functionality and appearance. These help to minimize any potential issues that may come up. Accordingly, we have completed our design for manufacturing processes so that we have a clear vision of how long it takes from when the various components reach us and the final product reaches your door.</p>

By backing and sharing our campaign we will be able to fund the initial molding, tooling, materials, and production of the HAMAC Energizer.

 
 
Our Long Journey
 
1. Proof of Concept and Functionality
a. Research and test current manual and electric grinders:

 
b. Test and analyze the functionality of gear motors: Test the speed, weight, and torque of 10       RPM, 30RPM and 80RPM gear motors to determine the most efficient in the balance of size, weight, and function. 30 RPM has been chosen accordingly.

 
2. Make, test and analyze the prototypes for functional and appearance improvements:
a. Dimensions and materials of the housing: ABS?b. Dimensions and materials of powder cover: ABS? Silicone?c. Grinding time: within 4 minutes for 30g?d. Noise levels: below hand grinder level 70?e. Arrange 3D print models based on the dimensions of drawings.

 
f. Final prototype performance:

Grinding time: 4 minutes for 40g
Weight: 350g
Size: length 145mm/height 60mm/width 53mm
dB level: 65-67
Housing: ABS plastics for its great resistance to heavy use and adverse environmental conditions.
Powder Cover: Silicone rubber for its excellent resistance to extreme temperatures he tensile strength, tear strength, elongation, and compression.

3. Planned to use injection molding for housing. Based on the refinements of prototypes, we have finished the CAD files.
 


 
4. Next steps: We are ready to
a. refine our prototypes.b. start the injection molding for housing and parts.c. refine the bill of materials.d. make and test production prototype and further refinements.e. start production.
 
²Researches:
Noise Levels, Safe Environments, Australia
Motor Speeds Explained: Diving into AC and DC Motors, Groschopp, Inc.
Gearmotor Sizing Guide, Bison Gear & Engineering Corp.
 
OUR TIMELINE

Our team consists of experienced electronics engineers, mechanical engineers, product designers, and IT and logistics specialists. Most importantly, we are a team of coffee lovers. Our love for coffee has led us to search the global marketplace for a coffee device that can solve both the problems of conventional manual and electric grinders at the same time. After discovering that there was no existing product, the idea for HAMAC was born. We set off on a mission to develop a no-compromise device that we know all coffee lovers will be proud to begin their day with. For the past year, we have turned our concept into a reality.  Please be part of our journey. Be among the first to have this innovative product.

Risks and Challenges
What you see here is a fully functional pre-production model. It is close to the final product except for housing refinements.
As with any hardware project, there are natural risks and challenges in engineering and manufacturing. We've done a lot to minimize risks for backers: We have completed generations of prototypes that have demonstrated all the key functionality and appearance. These help to minimize any potential issues that may come up. Accordingly, we have completed our design for manufacturing processes so that we have a clear vision of how long it takes from when the various components reach us and the final product reaches your door.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We are building our first production kitchen with a mini retail corner in Giswil (Obwalden, Switzerland).  We would like to share our Keto bakeries and desserts with as many people as possible and be able to bring these foods fresher and faster to everyone.</p>

<h3>Campaign Summary</h3>
<p>Lin Switzerland is an online keto bakery and dessert shop based in Switzerland, founded by Lin Chong, a certified keto lifestyle coach.  We dedicate ourselves to creating delicious and nutritious keto-friendly food that can be enjoyed by people who are on a low-carb / keto way of eating. Some of them have health conditions such as diabetes, sugar and gluten sensitivities etc.,  that prevent them from enjoying traditional bakeries.  </p>
<p>Currently, we are operating out of our home kitchen and we deliver all over Switzerland.  We have been doing this since December 2020.  Thanks to everyone's support, the bakery has become really busy! It is clear that we will no longer be able to meet the demands of our customers with our current set-up.  </p>
<p>In order to grow Lin Switzerland, we have decided to set up a production kitchen where we can hire some part-time bakers to help us scale the production up.  For example, the demand for our Keto Vegan Wraps has been so good we have to limit the quantities we can produce weekly.  With the production kitchen and part-time bakers, we will be able to fulfill everyone's desire for the wraps and more!</p>
<p>At the same time, we will create a mini retail corner where people can come by to pick up their orders or buy freshly baked breads and desserts.  We plan to open the mini retail once or twice a week to start.  </p>
<p>Finally, as requested by many customers, we will also hire some part-time help to translate our website into German, French and Italian. These freelancers will also provide customer service support in these languages.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to raise CHF25,000 through this campaign.  The money will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Furniture and fixtures </li>
<li>Ovens, refrigerators and freezers</li>
<li>Baking equipment</li>
<li>Display shelves</li>
<li>Cost of translating the website into German, French and Italian</li>
</ul>
<p>We are offering our supporters wonderful perks ranging from surprise boxes to discount cards and coaching packages.</p>
<p>In case we do not reach our funding goal, the project will still go ahead. We will grow slower and take more time to come up to the level of production that we would like to.  The space has already been leased and we will start moving in slowly in the first week of July 2021. The address is Panoramastrasse 18, 6074 Giswil. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is of utmost importance. No contribution is too small and our appreciation is immense for whatever you wish to support us with. </p>
<p>Lin Switzerland was started on a shoe-string and without an injection of funds, our growth is of course possible but very slow.  There is a real need in the market for keto products, not just for weight loss but also for weight gain (yes!) and more importantly to manage many medical conditions. </p>
<p>It gives us so much joy to see people so happy with these treats they are getting from us. We would like to continue doing so, and to also be able to innovate. In order to innovate, we need to make our production more efficient.  The new production kitchen will help us do exactly that.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Baking burnout! We really need to hire more bakers so we can get some sleep :-)</p>

<h3>The <i>quick</i> story ...</h3>
<p>Oh - How we’ve missed you!</p>
<p>It’s been just over two years since we closed our location at Bayswater, and even though we’ve seen a lot of our customers and neighbours at our various pop up events since then, we’ve missed actively being in, and contributing to the amazing community we love!</p>
<p>We’re really hoping to bring Hintonburger back home this spring for a season of great burgers, fries and a side of community.</p>
<p>But we really need your help</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The longer story ...<br/><i>Who we are &amp; how we've come to this point:</i>
</h3>
<p>When we first opened up in our little shack in the neighbourhood, we were quite overwhelmed by the support and love that we received. It seemed as it was the desire of our friends and neighbours to help us succeed.</p>
<p>It was thanks to our neighbours and supporters, that we received numerous accolades including being voted ‘Ottawa’s BEST Burger’ many times ... a reputation that we are committed to uphold and we strive for with each and every burger we make. We’ve been featured in newspapers, online blogs, books, radio, social media, local and national TV – all because of YOU and your support. Seriously - You lined up for us, you endured long wait times and you came with us to a few location moves as we grew! Your unwavering love and support kept us going for all these years!!!</p>
<p>Hintonburger was always eager to return the favour. We fed thousands of meals at our monthly neighbourhood breakfasts, raised money for local charities, donated food to various groups, fundraisers and more. We hired and trained local folks with barriers to employment. From day one, community involvement has been a top commitment and reward for the burger business that bears this great neighbourhoods name.</p>
<p>We love being in, and contributing to Hintonburg!</p>
<p>So - What happened?</p>
<p>Let’s summarize the last couple years quickly, and get back to the feel-good excitement of the relaunch!</p>
<p>After out-growing the shack, we moved to our second location. It was great but as time went on we then outgrew that location. Our last move, although a larger location had a lot of issues, including several robberies. It really just didn’t have the same vibe, then we started noticing a dip in sales, and to be honest, all these issues compounded and we got depressed. We were given an offer for early termination of our lease and we accepted, took a few weeks to clear our heads and spotted another location. It was too good to be true and soon that location fell apart, so without an ideal location we would miss the busiest months of the year.</p>
<p>At that point, we decided to reorganize and put plans and focus into coming back fresh and revitalized in the spring of 2020. See where this is going? We finished final negotiations and secured a location on March 10th 2020. A few days later on March 13th, lockdown was announced, thus dashing those hopes of reopening. With the restrictions in place we parted ways |and watched with heavy hearts as our friends pivoted and adapted constantly through the year. We hit the drawing board, and decided that it was best to wait, again, for spring 2021.</p>
<p>Still we missed it ...missed you. Thanks to the help of some friends, we were happy and excited to present a series of well received pop-up events, but wanted to do more.</p>
<p>This brings us to here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<span>What we need</span><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">... </i>
</h3>
<h3><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">and what we’ll give YOU in return:</i></h3>
<p>We have a solid plan which brings us back to the basics, or back to the shack style as it was, having a good time delivering great tasting, high quality, fresh handmade burgers using locally sourced ingredients and giving back to our community and supporters.</p>
<p>First of all - We have secured a new ‘home’ for Hintonburger</p>
<p>For now, we need to keep the location quiet until we meet our goal and can be sure we are able to relaunch as planned. What we can say is that while restrictions continue to be announced and changed and things seem uncertain, we have a great new location – one that will be able to adapt quickly to any restrictions that may happen or change to help ensure we can serve our delicious burgers no matter what.</p>
<p>We’ve also gathered and sourced great deals on most of the equipment and supplies we need to get up and running. A lot of time and funds have already been invested by the partners to help make this plan come to fruition.</p>
<p>We really need your support - Hintonburger needs to raise $6k to get going.</p>
<p>How will we use the funds raised here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kitchen equipment &amp; installation (fryers, sinks, prep tables, fridges)</li>
<li>Licenses, fees &amp; insurance</li>
<li>Kitchen Reno and decor</li>
<li>Initial food orders with our local suppliers and farmers</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve put together a fun set of rewards perks for our contributors.</p>
<p>Everything from stickers, shirts, burgers to some very limited and exclusive options.</p>
<p>Want to donate ... and you have a special reward in mind that we haven’t listed?<br/>We’re flexible, open for options and into collaboration – so drop us an email and let us know.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i>Other Ways You Can Help</i></strong></h3>
<p>Don’t forget that if you can’t contribute on this fundraising campaign or take advantage of the perks offered, you can still be a huge help by sharing this Indiegogo page on your socials  ...and by following, liking and commenting on ours. Tell your friends &amp; tell them to tell their friends – Help us spread the news.</p>
<p>Or do you have any skills you think might help us out at Hintonburger?</p>
<p>If you do, let us know - we love to collaborate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i>In Closing...</i></strong></h3>
<p>As always, THANKS so much for all of your dedication and support.</p>
<p>When we reopen, we will continue to give back &amp; support the community we love, while serving up delicious fresh, locally sourced, handmade food and having fun watching smiles on faces.</p>
<p><strong><i>Now... Who's hungry??? Who wants a HINTONBURGER ?</i></strong></p>

We’ve been featured in newspapers, online blogs, books, radio, social media, local and national TV – all because of YOU and your support. Seriously - You lined up for us, you endured long wait times and you came with us to a few location moves as we grew! Your unwavering love and support kept us going for all these years!!!
Hintonburger was always eager to return the favour. We fed thousands of meals at our monthly neighbourhood breakfasts, raised money for local charities, donated food to various groups, fundraisers and more. We hired and trained local folks with barriers to employment. From day one, community involvement has been a top commitment and reward for the burger business that bears this great neighbourhoods name.
We love being in, and contributing to Hintonburg!
So - What happened?
Let’s summarize the last couple years quickly, and get back to the feel-good excitement of the relaunch!
After out-growing the shack, we moved to our second location. It was great but as time went on we then outgrew that location. Our last move, although a larger location had a lot of issues, including several robberies. It really just didn’t have the same vibe, then we started noticing a dip in sales, and to be honest, all these issues compounded and we got depressed. We were given an offer for early termination of our lease and we accepted, took a few weeks to clear our heads and spotted another location. It was too good to be true and soon that location fell apart, so without an ideal location we would miss the busiest months of the year.
At that point, we decided to reorganize and put plans and focus into coming back fresh and revitalized in the spring of 2020. See where this is going? We finished final negotiations and secured a location on March 10th 2020. A few days later on March 13th, lockdown was announced, thus dashing those hopes of reopening. With the restrictions in place we parted ways |and watched with heavy hearts as our friends pivoted and adapted constantly through the year. We hit the drawing board, and decided that it was best to wait, again, for spring 2021.
Still we missed it ...missed you. Thanks to the help of some friends, we were happy and excited to present a series of well received pop-up events, but wanted to do more.
This brings us to here.


What we need... 

and what we’ll give YOU in return:
We have a solid plan which brings us back to the basics, or back to the shack style as it was, having a good time delivering great tasting, high quality, fresh handmade burgers using locally sourced ingredients and giving back to our community and supporters.
First of all - We have secured a new ‘home’ for Hintonburger
For now, we need to keep the location quiet until we meet our goal and can be sure we are able to relaunch as planned. What we can say is that while restrictions continue to be announced and changed and things seem uncertain, we have a great new location – one that will be able to adapt quickly to any restrictions that may happen or change to help ensure we can serve our delicious burgers no matter what.
We’ve also gathered and sourced great deals on most of the equipment and supplies we need to get up and running. A lot of time and funds have already been invested by the partners to help make this plan come to fruition.
We really need your support - Hintonburger needs to raise $6k to get going.
How will we use the funds raised here:

Kitchen equipment & installation (fryers, sinks, prep tables, fridges)
Licenses, fees & insurance
Kitchen Reno and decor
Initial food orders with our local suppliers and farmers

We’ve put together a fun set of rewards perks for our contributors.
Everything from stickers, shirts, burgers to some very limited and exclusive options.
Want to donate ... and you have a special reward in mind that we haven’t listed?We’re flexible, open for options and into collaboration – so drop us an email and let us know.

Other Ways You Can Help
Don’t forget that if you can’t contribute on this fundraising campaign or take advantage of the perks offered, you can still be a huge help by sharing this Indiegogo page on your socials  ...and by following, liking and commenting on ours.

In Closing...
As always, THANKS so much for all of your dedication and support.
When we reopen, we will continue to give back & support the community we love, while serving up delicious fresh, locally sourced, handmade food and having fun watching smiles on faces.

During this time, they also began to develop a range of <strong>canned products from European cuisine</strong>, mainly for their own enjoyment. However, word got out about these products and they received a lot of demand for tasting and buying. From this, they realized a great future and decided to create their company, ""<strong>La Colmena Del Lago.</strong>""</p><p>While developing the company, Jean-Baptiste and Christophe called on one of their friends, me (David), to join them and help with the distribution- thanks to his experience as a sales representative for one of the most famous Belgian distribution companies of international drinks.</p><p> </p><h2 align=""center""><strong>What is Mead ?</strong></h2><p>Mead is a fermented beverage mainly made of water, honey, and yeast. In other words, it is a <strong>wine made with honey</strong> instead of traditional wine grapes.</p><p>Mead also give you the opportunity to develop a huge diversity of flavors by mixing it with fruits, herbs, or spices. </p><p>Although it is the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world (we can find traces of this drink dating back to more than 7,000 years BC), mead has been a bit forgotten with the higher preference for beer and wine. HOWEVER, over the past years, the rise of mead has returned and has been covered by several newspapers such as <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>NPR</i>, and <i>Forbes</i>.</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/17/foodie-traveller-mead-honey-wine-us-new-england-london"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/17/...</a><br/><a href=""http://www.wsj.com/articles/meads-of-the-moment-1412367970"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wsj.com/articles/meads-of-the-moment...</a><br/><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/nyregion/mead"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/nyregion/mead</a>...</u><br/><u><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/t-magazine/fo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/t-magazine/fo</a>...</u><br/><u><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehlk45lii/mead/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehlk45lii/mead/#</a>...</u><br/><u><a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/04/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/04/</a>...</u><br/><u><a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-</a>...</u>  </p><p> </p><h2 align=""center""><strong>What Makes Our Mead Unique?</strong></h2><p>First of all, so far there are <strong>no branded mead producers in Guatemala</strong>.</p><p>Secondly, the honey we use to produce our mead is harvested either by Jean-Baptiste himself, who is a certified beekeeper, or by other trusted local producers that Jean-Baptiste has visited and carefully selected. Jean-Baptiste always ensures the <strong>quality</strong> of the honey and only the one approved by him is used. </p><p>Thirdly, the mead is a <strong>gluten free</strong> product, which is a characteristic increasingly desired by consumers.</p><p>Fourthly, most of the meads produced abroad are still (non-sparkling). However, our mead is <strong>dry and sparkling,</strong> so it's perfect for pairing with a meal or to be enjoyed by itself as an alternative to beer, wine, cider, or even champagne.</p><p>Moreover, we will also only be using ingredients from <strong>local suppliers</strong>. Therefore, you’re not only helping us, but the <strong>local economy</strong> as well.</p><p> </p><h2 align=""center""><strong>What We Need:</strong></h2><p>These Indiegogo funds will go towards bringing our mead to the market.

During this time, they also began to develop a range of canned products from European cuisine, mainly for their own enjoyment. However, word got out about these products and they received a lot of demand for tasting and buying. From this, they realized a great future and decided to create their company, ""La Colmena Del Lago.""While developing the company, Jean-Baptiste and Christophe called on one of their friends, me (David), to join them and help with the distribution- thanks to his experience as a sales representative for one of the most famous Belgian distribution companies of international drinks. What is Mead ?Mead is a fermented beverage mainly made of water, honey, and yeast. In other words, it is a wine made with honey instead of traditional wine grapes.Mead also give you the opportunity to develop a huge diversity of flavors by mixing it with fruits, herbs, or spices. Although it is the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world (we can find traces of this drink dating back to more than 7,000 years BC), mead has been a bit forgotten with the higher preference for beer and wine. HOWEVER, over the past years, the rise of mead has returned and has been covered by several newspapers such as The Guardian, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, NPR, and Forbes.https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/17/...http://www.wsj.com/articles/meads-of-the-moment...http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/nyregion/mead...http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/t-magazine/fo...http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ehlk45lii/mead/#...http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/08/04/...http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-...   What Makes Our Mead Unique?First of all, so far there are no branded mead producers in Guatemala.Secondly, the honey we use to produce our mead is harvested either by Jean-Baptiste himself, who is a certified beekeeper, or by other trusted local producers that Jean-Baptiste has visited and carefully selected. Jean-Baptiste always ensures the quality of the honey and only the one approved by him is used. Thirdly, the mead is a gluten free product, which is a characteristic increasingly desired by consumers.Fourthly, most of the meads produced abroad are still (non-sparkling). However, our mead is dry and sparkling, so it's perfect for pairing with a meal or to be enjoyed by itself as an alternative to beer, wine, cider, or even champagne.Moreover, we will also only be using ingredients from local suppliers. Therefore, you’re not only helping us, but the local economy as well. What We Need:These Indiegogo funds will go towards bringing our mead to the market. As you probably know, this process requires a professional kitchen and several permits and licences that include an environmental study of the impact of the production and a sanitary licence.So far, the three of us have invested a lot of private funds and all our time to:
Purchase all the equipment to produce the mead 
Purchase all the material to commercialize it (bottles, corks, labels, etc…)
Rent a space to stock equipment and material
 We are aiming to collect $18,000 or more for this campaign that we will use as detailed in the graph below : Itemized Breakdown: LICENSING (= $2,500) : To be able to commercialize our mead, we need several permits and licences such as an environmental study of the impact of the production, a sanitary license, a permit to sell alcohol, an analysis of our products, etc...CONSTRUCTION (= $7,200) : The building that we have been renting for our product making and storage no longer meets our growing need for more space. For this, it is necessary for us to construct a new space devoted solely to production, while the old building will be used for stock and storage.RENOVATION (= $2,500) : We will need to do some home improvement work in our storage space such as: a suspended ceiling, clog leaks, repaint, install a new floor …EQUIPMENT : (= $4,400) : Stainless steel worktop, biodigester, industrial stainless steel washbasin, water tank, water filter, water heater, more shelves, and more fermentation tanks /barrelsTRADEMARK REGISTRATION : (= $1,000) : $120 for a preliminary analysis + $880 for registrationCREATION OF A WEBSITE: (= $400)Any additional money raised will be used to buy a small piece of land where we could install more beehives and therefore be sure we can ensure the production of the mead using our high quality and organic honey supervised by Jean-Baptiste.Extra money can also give us the opportunity to hire a full time person in the village to assist us for the production and the distribution. What Do You Get for Supporting Us?Your support is vital for us and for the success of this project.Therefore we wanted to offer different perks so that all of you, regardless of your participation, can receive a little something to thank you (see the rewards from the list on the right)  !! The Perks:Option 1 : Free DonationTo do so, you can simply click on the ""Back It"" red button on the right of the video (or ""Soutenez ce projet"" in French - ""Respaldar"" in Spanish) and choose the amount of your help. Option 2 : High Five ($5) Receive our infinite gratitude for helping support young entrepreneurs like us!

We started in St Louis' Central West End in early 2013 from absolute scratch. Our friends and neighbors received us enthusiastically and warmly, and have kept us rolling and thriving. Thank you so much, we have been very blessed!The neighborhood-based model we've built from the rider up is how we have made and maintained such awesome relationships, and why our service is so remarkable. However, our unique way of dispatching also means there are not ready-made tools to help us grow this special way of doing business.We have been building software ourselves for two years! As it turns out, finishing up will cost us more money than we have. So we are turning to our current and new fans for help! This is a great way to show your love, help the local guys out, and get awesome stuff for your investment.$12,000 will allow us to roll out the tools we need right now to grow and serve you better. Anything beyond this goal, and we have a long list of features and services we will add.We are not able to add all the neighborhoods we want to while continuing to provide this amazing  service without the resources to complete this project, and all of your support is immensely appreciated.What is more important than money from this campaign is that you continue choosing us to bring you the best food in the neighborhood when you can't get out or want to stay in, and you share us with your friends! We remain the only local restaurant delivery service in St Louis, and you make this dream of ours a reality every day because you pick us and spread the good word.

<h3>Our Story (In Short)</h3>
<p>Hey, everybody, my name is Joey and I was inspired to make this amazing hot sauce for the love of my life, Lisa! We are committed to taking care of our bodies and our health - so when Lisa said one day that she wished they didn't put SUGAR in all the hot sauces out there I got to work! I went to the Farmer's Market in Mar Vista, CA the next day and found a woman who grows organic hot peppers - crazy ones! I came home and used the Italian cooking skills my 90-year-old Calabrian mother passed down to me over the years to make a hot sauce for Lisa.</p>
<p>Roasting and keeping true to the integrity and quality to create a hot sauce for her using the finest ingredients. It came out awesome! She loved it! The next day I was bragging about it to a colleague at work and he wanted in. Starting this whole journey into becoming an artisanal hot sauce maker!</p>
<p>Being healthy is complex. There is no one approach or quick fix. We all need to take responsibility for what we are putting into our bodies, the company that we keep in our life, exercise that we do and reading labels that are marketed as being ""healthy"" because all too often they are not. So I was inspired to make a product that people can trust. </p>
<p>That is why Joey's Hot Sauce is important to me. I love making a healthy option for people and seeing everyone's excitement about how good it tastes is so rewarding. In less than a year I have created over 2,000 bottles of this special hot sauce for friends and family. I have received RAVE reviews and it gives me incredible joy!</p>

<p>I am at a crossroads though, more and more people want Joey's Hot Sauce and I want to make it available to them. However in order to sell at Farmer's Markets, online, and in stores, there are some major steps we need to take - and we need your help!!</p>
<p>Here are a few things we need to do:</p>
<p>- Lease space in a commercial kitchen for production</p>
<p>- Get the certifications and licenses needed to sell </p>
<p>- Get lab tests</p>
<p>- Invest in large quantities of bottles/orifice reducers and labels</p>
<p>- Get a webstore up and running</p>
<p>- Market the crap out of Joey's Hot Sauce!</p>
<p>If you help us make this happen it would mean everything to me AND it would mean I can keep producing the hot sauce that you know and love! I don't want to have to stop!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>We need to raise $40,000 to take Joey's Hot Sauce to the next level. This money is going to get us into a commercial kitchen, get all of the certifications we need in order to sell our hot sauce at Farmer's Markets, online in our new Joey's Hot Sauce online store and in select stores. We are planning to produce over 1440 bottles per month and we need to invest in pallets of bottles to bring the cost down so we can keep the business profitable and continue to produce the best hot sauce on the planet. Once we are in the commercial kitchen we need a marketing budget in order to promote our sauce online so that we can get Joey's Hot Sauce into EVERYBODY'S fridge - and we need YOU in order to help make that happen!  </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>PERKS!!!!!!</p>
<ul><li>We are offering a ton of awesome perks like a Joey's Hot Sauce pin, t-shirt, a year supply of Joeys - you could even get your face on the bottle with a thank you from us, have Joey give you private healthy cooking lessons over videos conference OR have Joey cook an amazing dinner for you in your home for up to six people! </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Even if we don't reach our entire goal we will make progress in moving forward with the money we earn from this campaign. We are determined, and while we might have to move a little slower than we want to, the amount of money we raise here will be put to good use in our quest to get Joeys into everybody's fridge! </li></ul>

<h3>The Impact Joey's Hot Sauce Makes</h3>
<ul><li>Cancer and obesity rates are on the rise and our food industry is not well. Everyone has to be the CEO of their own health. The public is looking for healthier choices and unfortunately, the food industry is masking themselves as healthy products (aka ""natural"") but you really have to do your research to know if what you are getting is good for you! Luckily, Joey's Hot Sauce is something you can rely on - we use fresh organic ingredients and do not use any sweeteners, binders or fillers.  </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We started small making this out of our kitchen and have produced over 2,000 bottles for friends and family and friends of friends over the last year - and people are crazy about it. Joey has worked in the food industry for over 20 years, in particular in the health food arena with several renowned chefs including Neal Harden of Jean George and restaurants such as Pure Food &amp; Wine and Plant Food &amp; Wine. Lisa has been in the social media business for over ten years - executing numerous campaigns for brands big and small. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>The competition is fierce and there are a lot of small-batch hot sauce companies out there but now one brings the GOURMET HEAT like Joeys- blending heirloom peppers, using the finest ingredients and his Calabrian mother's cooking sensibilities to deliver the most rich-in-flavor hot sauce with the depth of heat but also adaptable to pair with almost any dish. </li></ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Saunders Family Bakery started from a dream to excel beyond the normal, local bakery scene, with the belief that local first can be brought into the market and understanding that seasonal selections offer an amazing base to expand our customers ideas of baked goods. With that desire we started to dabble in new ideas, using Terry's 23+ years experience in the bakery industry with the last 16+ being spent along the lakeshore to develop new recipes and tweak some traditional items. We are committed to preserving old bakery techniques like using long fermentation times and our hearty sourdough starter to create a complex flavor profile and introducing new ideas that allow for continued development of existing goods.  We plan to be in restaurants, our storefront and farmers markets so that our bread is available to you any day of the week, year round.</p>
<p>It is our desire to bring a unique relationship that allows for personalized service for our customers and customized service for our retail partners while connecting with the vibrant (and growing) local food network in Western Michigan, thus Saunders Family Bakery was developed and has begun bringing our style to old and new friends weekly.</p>
<p><strong>The Need:</strong></p>
<p>We want to host a place where young adults can go to hang out but also to share our testimony. We want to provide music and entertainment for those who don't want to hang out at a bar or want a quiet place to gather with friends for board games or quiet conversations. We also want to help provide training, as it fits in, to those who need support standing on their own feet.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Goals:</strong></p>
<p>This is a $100,000 project. We have already bought most of the necessary equipment, with just a few more items to buy. We are looking to raise $25000 to help gather the balance of the needed supplies/equipment. <strong>If we hit or exceed our goal that would be a blessing</strong> and we will apply all of it to items needed for the bakery. We are also working to look into SBA loans for the balance that we do not achieve here.</p>
<p>Here is a list of items we are pursuing with this fundraiser:</p>
<p>Lighting</p>
<p>Furniture</p>
<p>Signage</p>
<p>Appliances</p>
<p>Coffee Bar needs</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that this is the path laid before us and ask for your support reaching this goal.</p>
<p><strong>Our Amazing Perks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsor status on our website</li>
<li>Free Coffee/Pastry Coupon</li>
<li>Vinyl Car Sticker</li>
<li>Saunders Family Bakery T-shirt</li>
<li>Saunders Family Bakery mug</li>
<li>Personalized mug hung on the wall with free weekly coffee for a year!</li>
<li>Private Dessert party for you and a friend</li>
<li>Private Dessert board game Party at our Bakery for up to 15 people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Your support goes beyond just a monetary contribution, it is planting the seed for a long lasting network of high quality local food in Western Michigan.  We realize that not everyone is able to make a contribution.  We would greatly appreciate if you would at least help us spread the word!  Please share with friends on Facebook if you think they might be interested.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this campaign and we hope to put some amazing baked goods in your hands very soon! </p>
<p><strong>DAY 2:</strong></p>
<p>We have scheduled our meeting with the architect to layout our floor plan and determine where specifics for electric, gas lines and plumbing will be. We are thankful for the prayers and unspoken support that we have seen in the last 24 hours. Please continue to pray for us and that we continue down the path laid out for us! </p>

<p><i><strong>Bringing new light to a different way of brewing.</strong></i></p>
<p>While barley is highly regarded in the world of beer, corn is often disregarded as a brewing grain and even, at times, treated with disdain.  However, the history of brewing with corn goes back at least as far as that for barley, and is rooted right here in the Western Hemisphere.  At Dos Luces, we have explored the history behind some of the many styles of beer traditionally brewed with corn, and have embraced corn as our core grain.  The “Dos” Luces (Two Lights) represent our two core types of beer, a corn-based Chicha and a corn and agave-based Pulque.</p>
<p>Dos Luces. The sun and the moon. Inti and Meztli. Chicha and Pulque. We chose the name Dos Luces because it represents the duality of light – While you might be tempted to imagine this as light and darkness, we prefer to consider the bright light of day in contrast to the brightest beacon of light at night. Call it divine inspiration or simply the accumulation of ideas within two swirling brains, Dos Luces represents the idea that there is always light when you look for it.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510865838/u0ltb1kzx7xvyvtilwxi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Dos Luces is the result of when two people who love beer get together and start talking.</strong></i></p>
<p>Judd Belstock, the owner and founder, has been in the beer industry since he was 23 years old. His interest in Chicha and Pulque began years before he was born, when his father spent time in the mountains of Peru, working with the Peace Corps around Cuzco. After childhood trips to various regions in Mexico, as well as rooted interest in the history of the Americas before the Conquistadors, Judd went onto a business career selling and marketing beer. That’s where he met Sam Alcaine, and eventually started asking the question, “What if we fermented something other than barley?”</p>
<p>Sam Alcaine, Co-founder, brewed his first beer in college, and has been hooked on fermentation ever since. Son of El Salvadoran and Cuban immigrants, he has always loved studying the unique fermented foods and beverages of the Americas. Sam has been a brewer, food microbiologist, and now is a professor of fermentations. Over the years he’s scoured the States for Pulque, malted corn in his apartment, and encouraged everyone to drink these bubbling brews. He and Judd met many moons ago, and now the sun has risen on the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of rich traditions and ferment something different.</p>

<p><i><strong>Coming to Denver’s Historic South Broadway Neighborhood in 2018.</strong></i></p>
<p>We are very proud to be located on Denver’s Historic South Broadway. What used to be a street filled with antique stores and car dealerships is now turning into a thoroughfare filled with restaurants, breweries, recreational marijuana shops, coffee roasters, and doggie day-cares. Our own location was originally used as a sales room for a supplier of instruments for school bands, and later became an antique store. As the street has changed over the decades, and continues to change, Dos Luces looks forward to being a part of its future. We are very happy to be on the same block as food and beverage innovators like Black Project Spontaneous and Wild Ales, Adelitas Cocina, Palenque Mezcal Bar, Chupaflor Ice Cream, and Maria Empanada. Within just a few blocks, you can also find Grandma’s House Brewery, brewing (among other things) Colorado’s first craft Sake Gaijan 24886, Alternation Brewing, La Chiva Columbian restaurant, and Azucar Peruvian Bakery. Can’t wait to see what comes next!</p>

<p><i><strong>Your Funds Will Make the Brewery Truly Special</strong></i></p>
<p>The $10,000 goal for this project will be used to put the finishing touches on the brewery, most notably furniture and glassware.  That said, construction is proving much more costly than anticipated, so we've had to cut some things out of the original plan.  If we raise more than the goal, it will help bring some of this things back, up to and including a full-fledged pilot brewery if we can raise $100,000 or more. </p>

After childhood trips to various regions in Mexico, as well as rooted interest in the history of the Americas before the Conquistadors, Judd went onto a business career selling and marketing beer. That’s where he met Sam Alcaine, and eventually started asking the question, “What if we fermented something other than barley?”
Sam Alcaine, Co-founder, brewed his first beer in college, and has been hooked on fermentation ever since. Son of El Salvadoran and Cuban immigrants, he has always loved studying the unique fermented foods and beverages of the Americas. Sam has been a brewer, food microbiologist, and now is a professor of fermentations. Over the years he’s scoured the States for Pulque, malted corn in his apartment, and encouraged everyone to drink these bubbling brews. He and Judd met many moons ago, and now the sun has risen on the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of rich traditions and ferment something different.

Coming to Denver’s Historic South Broadway Neighborhood in 2018.
We are very proud to be located on Denver’s Historic South Broadway. What used to be a street filled with antique stores and car dealerships is now turning into a thoroughfare filled with restaurants, breweries, recreational marijuana shops, coffee roasters, and doggie day-cares. Our own location was originally used as a sales room for a supplier of instruments for school bands, and later became an antique store. As the street has changed over the decades, and continues to change, Dos Luces looks forward to being a part of its future. We are very happy to be on the same block as food and beverage innovators like Black Project Spontaneous and Wild Ales, Adelitas Cocina, Palenque Mezcal Bar, Chupaflor Ice Cream, and Maria Empanada. Within just a few blocks, you can also find Grandma’s House Brewery, brewing (among other things) Colorado’s first craft Sake Gaijan 24886, Alternation Brewing, La Chiva Columbian restaurant, and Azucar Peruvian Bakery. Can’t wait to see what comes next!

Your Funds Will Make the Brewery Truly Special
The $10,000 goal for this project will be used to put the finishing touches on the brewery, most notably furniture and glassware.  That said, construction is proving much more costly than anticipated, so we've had to cut some things out of the original plan.  If we raise more than the goal, it will help bring some of this things back, up to and including a full-fledged pilot brewery if we can raise $100,000 or more.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Chasing my dream of starting Blended Acai</h3>
<p>As you all may know I recently decided to open a Superfood Bar called Blended Acai. As some of you may not know is the why behind it. Shortly after Chris and I got married in 2011, I got really sick and in addition our infertility my body basically stopped digesting my food properly. And because I was very sick and didn't have any answers from doctors. They diagnosed me with IBS. And maybe that's what I had. I still am unsure. But I had to take a look at what foods I was eating and the food labels. My gut was so bad I couldn't even consume basic foods. That's when my passion for healthy foods started. I found and fell in love with acai and smoothies. And I decided if I can help myself and anyone else have a better quality of life through food then I just have to. And that's where the idea of Blended Acai began. But sadly because of unexpected increased construction costs and startup costs Blended Acai may not exist. So I am starting this campaign to help with costs and allow this dream to continue to reach more people. I am not asking for much or please do not feel like you have to contribute. But even the smallest amount will help.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise between $3000-$5000 to help with startup costs such as payroll, cost of food, lease, and any other monthly expense associated with the business. With your contribution you will be helping Blended Acai stay not just a dream but existing to help people feel their best from the inside out! Because what you eat really does matter. And making one healthy decision at a time helps us be our best so we can do our best!</p>
<p>Even if you are not able to contribute financially you can help by sharing because spreading this campaign. Also stopping by and experiencing our delicious food helps us as well!</p>
<p>And thank you from the bottom of my heart! It means the world to me to have your such an amazing support system!</p>

<h2>From Ashes to Glasses</h2>
<p>On October 9th, 2017, we bundled our kids into our mini-van and peeled out as the Nun’s Canyon wildfire bore down on our home and small vineyard. We bid a hasty goodbye to the house that had been our home for the past year, having moved to Kenwood in 2016 with the goal of raising our kids in a more natural environment, and the longer term dream of starting our own wine label. The next day we got confirmation of the news we were dreading, nothing was left of our home, or the vintage water tower next to it, but a smokey pile of ash.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566951024/rtf3zsmoxbbehh7swzpg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A few weeks later, humbled by the outpouring of love and support we received from our new community, distraught by the destruction wrought on our beautiful, adopted valley, and needing to turn our personal tragedy into something positive, Hamilton Family Wines was born. Our mission from the start has been to shine a light on everything that makes Sonoma special: the people, the landscape, and the wines that are born of both. Working with Sonoma-native winemaker, Jess Wade, and sourcing only Sonoma fruit, our wines are indicative of the region’s unique terroir. </p>
<p>Our initial release includes our 2017 Petaluma Gap Pinot Noir, a 2018 Indian Springs Ranch Sauvignon Blanc, and a 2018 Sonoma Coast Rosé of Pinot Noir, with a 2018 Deering Vineyard Grenache Syrah, Mourvedre (GSM), a 2018 Placida Vineyards Pinot Noir, and a 2018 Sonoma Valley Bordeaux blend aging on French oak until spring of next year. Our total annual production is between 600-800 cases.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Dream</h3>
<p>Our next step is to open a private-by-appointment tasting room on our property. Our goal is to convert the old steel barn into an inside/outside tasting space with a rustic, farmhouse chic feel. The approval process is going to take time, money, and commitment, which is why we've kept the funding goal open. But, our wines are already in bottle, so you can feel secure knowing your support will be rewarded. </p>
<p>Community is very important to us, and as we grow we intend to continue to give back to our community by creating and supporting jobs, funding access to food for those in need, and advocating for, and donating to, equal access to great education and affordable housing. We're also passionate about the environment, and farm our vineyard organically. We're committed to sourcing our fruit from other sustainable, organic, and biodynamic vineyards whenever possible. So while you're sipping on some fantastic Hamilton Family wine, you can feel even better knowing your support is doing good.</p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>In addition to helping a small family business, and our commitments above, we have some fun and original perks! From naming one of our vines to private, hosted winemaker dinners, we've tried to appeal to a range of tastes and budgets. We very much believe in the personal touch, so we'll be involved in everything here, but if you have ideas or suggestions for how to make a perk perfect for you, let us know!</p>

""The beers of the ancient Egyptians were flavored with cardamom and coriander, for the Egyptians had no hops; their beers were rich and flavorsome and thirst quenching. You could build pyramids after drinking that beer, and sometimes people did."" - Neil Gaiman The beginning Once upon a time two guys, humble homebrewers, were drinking beers comparing them to their home crafted projects, when the idea crawled in and sprouted a fairy tale that became our project. We wanted to give everyone a possibility to become a homebrewer. To create your own beer and try out something you have never tried before. You can have your own beer for special occasions like a birthday or a bachelor party. For anniversary or as a present for your beer loving friend. Or maybe for every day cause you want to try out many flavors and combinations. How all this works Don’t be scared, it’s easy!Your adventure starts with choosing one of four different beer styles on our website, lets say pale ale. Then you can get creative  and add some character to your style with a little lime for refreshing the hot summer day, or some coffee and chili to enjoy after a nice meal. How about adding some bacon, to give your beer a nice smoky flavor, or just because it’s bacon.  Now you have started drooling and are becoming impatient, but adventure is not over yet. Next you will decide on one of suggested  labels to make your bottles unique or upload a picture that you can always look upon and remember: this was my creation! But what kind of a masterpiece would it be without a name. Choose in how many bottles you want to enjoy and don’t forget: You Name It, And We Brew It ! So, while all this works perfectly on a small homebrewing scale, we needed help to bring this idea to all of you.Next logical step was starting this crowdfunding campaign and designing all these perks so you can have fun and enjoy our products while simultaneously helping us to start this one of a kind brewery. It’s a symbiotic relationship. Brewtiful perks You are a beer lover and you want to go to a pub or a bar. Don't go in some lame shirt :)Women's and men's T-shirts in four different colors. Pick one!Just to show you the rainbow of your teeth and lighter savers. This is a beer coaster with a cool logo. And it will hold Your personalized beer on it!If you are on a party, mark your bottle with this mustache bottle marker. You will get some laughs and avoid drinking from someones bottle with a warmed up beer.Imagine that you are sipping beers and soaking up the sun on a prow of small boat. And when beer can't cool you enough, there is a transparent sea that will do the job amazingly. When you get hungry there will be snacks and a meal and you will realize that ""pomalo"", the dalmatian way of living, is becoming your way. Don't just imagine! Timeline  The fundamental idea of homebrewing is trying out new recipes, pushing the borders in creating beer, adding ingredients restricted only by your imagination.While homebrewing is pushing the borders in creating different and unusual beer, Brew my Beer team is pushing the borders of homebrewing itself.Help us fund this project and together we can start brewing. Ways to helpFor those that have will but not the funds there are other ways to help :- spread the word among your friends",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>Bristol Station Brews &amp; Taproom was founded with the passion to make great beer.  Our goal is to provide a beer for everyone, whether you're a novice or a beer aficionado.  The dream started between two home-brewers with ​the idea to operate a brewery in Downtown Bristol.  Believe In Bristol's first Entrepreneur's contest gave us the initial motivation to move forward with the idea.   After spending several months looking for the right location, we found the Historic Greyhound Bus Station in downtown Bristol.  The brewery opened with a 10 barrel brewing system which is one of the largest in the area. Beer production began in 2015, and we carry 12 beers on tap at any given time.  Due to our quaint taproom and relatively small size, we are able to brew  seasonal beers and even fulfill requests from our customers.  We then started to distribute our beers throughout the Tri-Cities TN/VA area.  Very quickly we started winning awards and medals for our great beers!! The can is the next step for us.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>CAMPAIGN PURPOSE</strong></h3>
<p>We fill lots of growlers in the taproom, but they are heavy and bulky, made of glass and not very portable.  They don't fit very well in coolers!  We have had lots of requests to put our great beers in aluminum cans.  A vessel that is light and portable, easily recyclable, and can easily be taken to many different venues.  Also, cans can be distributed throughout the Tri-Cities, nay the WORLD, very easily.  We will put four of our award winning beers in cans immediately.  But we need your help!  There are significant hurdles to cross before we can do that, all of which are expensive.  Once we get the first run completed, future runs are much easier.  And we intend to continue to can our flagship beers and our limited seasonal beers all year long.  Thus giving you the opportunity to enjoy our beers anywhere - but just as if you were in the taproom!!</p>
<p>We here at Bristol Station listen to our customers.  We want to make great craft beer that you want to enjoy.  Whether you enjoy it here, there or anywhere, we are here to make you happy!  That's what makes our jobs so rewarding! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>With your financial backing, we can take the next step toward fulfilling your requests, and get our beer into a can, which would help us get more fresh great-tasting beer to you.  We are striving to raise $5,000.00 to start our first canning run.  This money will go towards label design, ingredients, and canning supplies and production. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We only focus on one product here - beer!  And this whole project is about getting beer in a can to you.  So we only have one perk - beer!  <strong>Your $50.00 donation will get you four (4) packs of award-winning Bristol Station beer</strong>.  We are canning four different beers, so if you want a pack of each, go for it!  If you want all one beer that's great too!  Mix and match however you like.  This beer is for you!</p>
<p>Every penny helps and we really need every penny.  But if we do not reach or goal of $5,000.00 we will still start canning, it will just take a little longer.  If we reach our goal immediately, we will start the canning process immediately.  Current estimate is mid-January.  If not, we will can this summer once we have sufficient funds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We have always been a small brewery, paying for everything as we go, not incurring huge debt.  We focus on the beer and our customer's experience.  Our beers have a proven track record as multiple award winners in multiple contests and festivals.  We are confident that you will enjoy our beers.  However, putting that beer in cans is expensive.  This will be the hardest challenge we've faced since we've opened.  And it's a long process to complete.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill our customers' request we have decided to utilize a mobile canning company to achieve our goal.  This limits our up-front costs and allows us to get to market more quickly.  This also allows us to be flexible with the beers that we put into cans.  Our Strawberry Pail Ale is our most sought after seasonal beer, and for many of you our most requested canned beer.  By using a mobile canning line we are able to change up and do this very easily when strawberry season arrives.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hopefully you can support our efforts in making this canning dream become a reality. If you can't at this time, there are still opportunities for you to assist us!</p>
<p>Something as simple as sharing this campaign with your friends, family, and your community can bring awareness to this campaign.  Together we can make our dream a reality! </p>
<p>Please take a minute to share this campaign on your social media channels or invite folks via email.</p>

After a lot of hard work, I feel fortunate to be realizing my dream.
JJ Cooney (Partner) - After spending 20+ years in IT sales, I realized that your career should be more than just your income.  I wanted to be a part of a company that was giving back and nourishing their customers’ well being.   In 2016, Justin and I began our partnership and started looking at national expansion.  For the past three years, my passion, and energy for our juice and its benefits have changed my life, and I’m excited to help change the lives of so many more.
Our Mission:
With our campaign, we are raising funds to open up our next two regions in Southern California and Northern Virginia. Our goals of expansion within Major League Baseball continue in the form of partnering with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Anaheim Angels, Arizona Diamondbacks, Philadelphia Phillies, Baltimore Orioles, and Washington Nationals.   Along with our desire to expand our partnership with Major League Baseball, other professional sports organizations and collegiate athletics, we are excited and focused on growing our home/business customer base within these local communities. 


Our mission is create a culture around corporate social responsibility (Corporate Good) with a focus amongst our employees, customers, and our communities we serve, on giving back and raising awareness on the importance of nutrition and an overall healthy well being. Whether it's working with local organizations, helping our veterans return to the workforce, or partnering with our local schools and youth sports programs.  We're finding creative ways to ""spread the juice"" here in San Diego and Southern California.

Customer Inspiration has become a hallmark of why we do, what we do!
We are honored and humbled that you are joining us on this exciting and game changing journey.
Thank you so very much for your support,

<h3>The ""Mead""-Cute</h3>
<p>Matt Loch moved to Nashville with a dream - to brew amazing meads using local honey.  He was still a hobby-brewer, making two gallons at a time since his college days.  After asking around, he was pointed in the direction of Ross Welbon - professional beer brewer with a penchant for beekeeping.  Matt jumped straight to the chase and asked to buy some of Ross's honey - and Ross refused!  The honey was a gift so long as they could brew together - and the seed of the Honeytree was planted!  Two years and many more gallons of honey later, Matt and Ross are ready to open their doors!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without the bees, there is no honey to make mead.  Honeytree Meadery is committed to environmental stewardship through ecologically balanced business practices.  We will accomplish this goal through spurring growth in local apiaries through adding value to an existing agricultural product, and introducing ways to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same.</p>

<li>We currently have over a dozen presale accounts - folks excited to serve our mead and support the bees!</li>

<h3>Meet the Maker</h3>
<p>Heyyy.... My name is Amber, I like to tell people that I am the cake designer of your wildest dreams! I started baking cakes 6 years ago for a non-profit called ""Birthday Cakes 4 Free"" I would bake and deliver cakes to children and seniors who could not afford a cake on their special day. It was a way for me to include my family in giving back to our community.  To let them feel in their hearts the love and joy they could give someone less fortunate than them.  It started as a passion project, that turned into what I know I'm meant to be doing. Bringing joy into the lives of many by providing one of a kind custom designed cakes, with the best ingredients, a little bit of my heart and soul, and a whole lotta love.</p>
<p>I am a Veteran of the United States Air Force. My service taught me that we are stronger together than by ourselves.  Along with Birthday Cakes 4 Free, I donate cakes to Military families. I know how hard it is transitioning back into civilian society and I will do everything in my power to continue helping our large Veteran community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542169007/nle9cy5lu9soxy5pacl5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>A Few Things You should Know</strong></h3>
<p>Sift and Gather was brought to life with the idea that when you gather and surround yourself with like minded people, only great things can happen. Add in the cake, and it's bound to be an unforgettable experience that you remember forever. This campaign is being crafted with good intentions. Allowing me to represent something I am so sooooo passionate about.  I want to be that person, whose place you come to for positive vibes that brings the community together. Whether it be workshops, cake tutorials, networking events, drinking margaritas, or just eating cake! Creating cakes, that create moments, that's what I do. Allowing people to gather together in happiness and love, all while looking at a piece of art that you can also EAT!  Starting a business is a roller coaster... What started off as an idea with a budget, grew into a magical unicorn that needs a way bigger budget. And that is why I need your help. The community of Olympia has been great to me. I have done my best to return the love and want to continue the best way I know how, CAKE. </p>
<p>I provide happiness, and nostalgia, along with new memories through the celebrations that happen gathered around  my cakes. After all, cake always helps make these moments just a little bit sweeter! Another special part of making cakes is enjoying it with my 7yr old son Levi, who was suddenly diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 9 months ago. My menu will have a focus on exact and easily accessible ingredients and carbohydrate ratios. Diabetes affects millions of people, there is no cure, and it is a life long disease that is centered around food. Diabetics are not able to sit down and eat whenever they feel like it, and my heart breaks every day for my son and all the others affected by Type 1 Diabetes. I want my son and all diabetics to be able to know how many carbohydrates are in their food, so they can enjoy it whenever and wherever, just like you and me.  Sift and Gather is that special place for a Type 1 Diabetic! <strong>#levistrong </strong>There will be menu items at Sift and Gather where proceeds will go to helping find a cure for Type 1 Diabetes every single day. It's time to find a cure, and you can be a part of that.</p>

<h3><strong>The Space</strong></h3>
<p>With your help, I will be able to finish this project and it will be 100% self sufficient. 299 square feet of modern marble counter tops, concrete floors, gorgeous lighting, and a farmers market like atmosphere. All located in the heart of downtown Olympia inside an artisan gathering place, the <a href=""https://www.222market.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">222 Market Place</a>!  Initially we thought the place was move in ready, with the exception of me having to put in the oven and share the three compartment sink and a dishwasher.  Then I found out I will need my own and in order to get it I need to make some major cosmetic renovations. This also includes an architect which was not in my budget. As a new business owner my budget is spandex tight and these additions and upgrades have to be done. I have built a great following and an anticipation for my opening through donating cakes, as well as collaborating with people from Olympia, all the way to Idaho.  The business is there and I am ready to soar.  I want it so bad I can taste it and the only thing sweeter than it's success will be my cakes.</p>

Share my campaign link, share pictures of my cakes, comment on my posts, or just stop by the studio and say HELLO!!</div></div>","Meet the Maker
Heyyy.... My name is Amber, I like to tell people that I am the cake designer of your wildest dreams! I started baking cakes 6 years ago for a non-profit called ""Birthday Cakes 4 Free"" I would bake and deliver cakes to children and seniors who could not afford a cake on their special day. It was a way for me to include my family in giving back to our community.  To let them feel in their hearts the love and joy they could give someone less fortunate than them.  It started as a passion project, that turned into what I know I'm meant to be doing. Bringing joy into the lives of many by providing one of a kind custom designed cakes, with the best ingredients, a little bit of my heart and soul, and a whole lotta love.
I am a Veteran of the United States Air Force. My service taught me that we are stronger together than by ourselves.  Along with Birthday Cakes 4 Free, I donate cakes to Military families. I know how hard it is transitioning back into civilian society and I will do everything in my power to continue helping our large Veteran community.

A Few Things You should Know
Sift and Gather was brought to life with the idea that when you gather and surround yourself with like minded people, only great things can happen. Add in the cake, and it's bound to be an unforgettable experience that you remember forever. This campaign is being crafted with good intentions. Allowing me to represent something I am so sooooo passionate about.  I want to be that person, whose place you come to for positive vibes that brings the community together. Whether it be workshops, cake tutorials, networking events, drinking margaritas, or just eating cake! Creating cakes, that create moments, that's what I do. Allowing people to gather together in happiness and love, all while looking at a piece of art that you can also EAT!  Starting a business is a roller coaster... What started off as an idea with a budget, grew into a magical unicorn that needs a way bigger budget. And that is why I need your help. The community of Olympia has been great to me. I have done my best to return the love and want to continue the best way I know how, CAKE. 
I provide happiness, and nostalgia, along with new memories through the celebrations that happen gathered around  my cakes. After all, cake always helps make these moments just a little bit sweeter! Another special part of making cakes is enjoying it with my 7yr old son Levi, who was suddenly diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 9 months ago. My menu will have a focus on exact and easily accessible ingredients and carbohydrate ratios. Diabetes affects millions of people, there is no cure, and it is a life long disease that is centered around food. Diabetics are not able to sit down and eat whenever they feel like it, and my heart breaks every day for my son and all the others affected by Type 1 Diabetes. I want my son and all diabetics to be able to know how many carbohydrates are in their food, so they can enjoy it whenever and wherever, just like you and me.  Sift and Gather is that special place for a Type 1 Diabetic! #levistrong There will be menu items at Sift and Gather where proceeds will go to helping find a cure for Type 1 Diabetes every single day. It's time to find a cure, and you can be a part of that.

We are Laura and Ruairi and we own a BBQ sauce and BBQ dry rubs manufacturing company called Great Northern Larder. We are based in Dundalk, which is a former industrial and railway town just north of Dublin in Ireland. We both have backgrounds in retail and business, and we have been making and sell our sauces in shops and supermarkets for over 3 years now.</p><p>We are both deeply passionate about BBQ and we have spent the last few years cooking over wood almost daily to perfect BBQ techniques and flavours from the USA, Germany, Portugal, South America, and South Africa. We have combined this learning with a deep knowledge of local Irish meats and ingredients. We now want to bring proper low and slow wood smoked BBQ to Ireland. We intend to build a BBQ joint from an upcycled shipping container and to commission bespoke offset smokers (barbecues) from Smokin Soul in Co. Wexford. Then we will serve freshly cooked pork, beef, chicken, lamb, fish, and vegetables from our BBQ joint every weekend.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597995769/k3ys0isxlq1zvsleiuov.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Laura is the founder of Great Northern Larder and a passionate lover of BBQ. Like many great food pioneers Laura is a pharmacist by trade and loves the science behind food and fire.</i></p><p>The Great Northern Larder BBQ Joint will be a community focused project. We will buy all our meat and ingredients from local producers and we will showcase the best Irish food and ingredients. We will teach people how to BBQ, we will support local communities, we will promote local businesses, and we will contribute enormously to BBQ culture in Ireland. But we need your help. Traditional sources of funding are hard to raise during the current recession and traditional banks do not understand the concepts behind BBQ. They cannot think past fish and chips. We need a better way of funding the BBQ Joint. We need you to help. We need you to be part of the BBQ revolution in Ireland.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597996218/jckc5ja2of0w6bhbawa4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Our signature sandwich is marjoram rubbed pork neck smoked over local silver birch and served on a bed of homemade sauerkraut and homemade Belfast style ""vita"" rye bread.

The smokers alone cost €10,000 and there are lots of legal and regulatory issues. The container is coming in at about €20,000 including fixtures and fittings. Then finally we need site works and drainage. We have raised about €20,000 so far from our own funds and we need your help to raise the rest. But we are not looking for a freebie. We want to give you something in return.</p><p>We have some unique perks for you. You can throw us a small few bob in return for your name on the wall of fame, but for a little extra you can grab some really exiting merchandise and vouchers. We have really cool Great Northern Larder socks from the Irish Sock Society, we have premium fitted t-shirts, and we have a lovely swag bag for 2. We also have vouchers for meals in the new BBQ joint, and if it turns out you can’t make it you can spend them all on our sauce and condiments website instead. So you can’t lose. One incredibly special perk you might like is our BBQ training session. With a maximum of 6 attendees and a trainer who is a qualified instructor and expert BBQ chef this is an opportunity not to be missed. You even get to eat everything you cook!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597995859/oinpo6ubwrx2wnlfgmgp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>This Peking Duck is a Great Northern Larder specialty.

If we don’t make it, we will bank the money safely and continue to raise capital elsewhere until we can make our dream a reality. Your perks will be delivered no matter what – merch will be posted, BBQ lessons will go ahead (you will have loads of dates options), and vouchers will be honoured at <a href=""https://greatnorthernlarder.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">greatnorthernlarder.com</a> or can be held onto for when we do get up and running. But anyway, that will not be an issue, as we know you will support us and make this happen!

Sometimes they even use microwaves. This is not how BBQ should work, and for purists like us it is sacrilege. We only cook over wood and when the meat is ready it is ready. That might take 10 hours, or it might take 14. It is then rested for a couple of hours before it is at its most juicy, tender, and flavoursome. Every cut of meat is different every cut of wood is different, and every day is different due to wind and weather.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597995801/apu2z9ezfju53wjcdfw3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>A platter of baby back ribs, pork belly, and beef ribs coated in our Scotch BBQ sauce. This photo was taken by an amateur on a mobile phone - and it still looks juicy enough to eat off your screen - imagine it in real life!</i></p><p>So how do we perfectly serve meat when and only when it is ready to eat? We do what real BBQ pit masters insist on doing across the southern states of the USA. We open when it is ready, and we close when it is all eaten and gone. But we don’t want people hopping in their car to drive to us and find we are sold out, so we will have an online reservation system where you can put your name on your meat in advance. We then have the traffic lights.</p><p>Red means we are closed. No meat for sale, nothing to see here, call back later.</p><p>We went a little Northern Irish with red and amber on together which means we are about to change to green. Hang around, it won’t be long now. Your meat is resting and almost ready to serve.</p><p>Green means we are open and serving. Come in, order some brisket or baby back ribs, take a seat, listen to the music, enjoy life for a while.</p><p>Amber means last orders. Sometimes in BBQ these are the nest bits – they have been rested the longest and the server is usually eager to get home so you 200g of beef can easily become 250g.</p><p>But wait, I said this saves you a drive? How do I see the traffic lights from my home? We thought of that – with a little magic we will make sure that the colour of the lights is reflected across all our social media and online presence.</p><h2>The Great Northern Larder Paradise BBQ Bus</h2><p>A couple of years ago forest fires decimated Paradise in California. The city was a blackened char with almost everything burnt to the ground. If you look closely on Google satellite images from after the fire you can see a tiny patch of green – a spec in the middle of the devastation. This was the garden of a Volkswagen loving BBQ enthusiast. For reasons known only to the universe his garden and his VW bus were the only part of Paradise that was not taken. Unfortunately, he did lose his house but like most of the residents he was safely evacuated.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597995708/mjx8l0kydoop0smzwq7h.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>The BBQ Bus is a 1971 ""micro-bus"" which was the 70s equivalent of a modern SUV. Note the melted indicator on the right hand side and the laminate (plastic) on the windscreen has also melted.</i></p><p>Great Northern Larder had been on the lookout for a BBQ bus when we got a call telling us that there was a fire damaged bus available for sale in America. We exchanged photos and quickly realised this wasn’t an engine fire - it was something much more interesting. The fire had not damaged the bodywork at all, but it has melted the windows, the lights, and the dashboard. This machine was rad looking and just screamed BBQ bus. We imported it and right now it is being gently restored and converted by a company called Retro Food Trucks in County Meath.</p><p>Although the BBQ Joint is a shipping container and technically mobile, the BBQ bus will allow us to move a little faster. We will be able to do off-site BBQs, promotions, and events. None of your money is required for the BBQ Bus – it is paid for already, but we thought it was important to mention as it will be a valuable contributor to the success of this project.</p><h2>Why is this a Good Investment?</h2><p>By helping us you are supporting a small Irish business and the jobs it provides. You are helping to bring real BBQ to Ireland. You are supporting one of the most unique food ideas we have seen on this island in a long time. Probably the best reason to support this BBQ joint is so as you can eat there!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597995919/asubtbz5neagdjkvax3r.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Our range of sauces - when you back this project remember that we are already well established in the food industry and we are putting our own reputation and money on the line in an big way.</i></p><p>Laura and Ruairi have a good track record in the food industry. We have a large range of products that are for sale in the likes of Avoca and the big supermarkets. We have collaborated with many local businesses on e-commerce projects, menu designs, and product development. Last year we competed in the KCBS Irish barbecue championships and managed to come 2<sup>nd</sup> out of the Irish teams.</p><h2>How Can I Help?</h2><p>We need your financial support, but if you can’t do that then please help us by sharing this fundraiser on your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages.

We then have the traffic lights.Red means we are closed. No meat for sale, nothing to see here, call back later.We went a little Northern Irish with red and amber on together which means we are about to change to green. Hang around, it won’t be long now. Your meat is resting and almost ready to serve.Green means we are open and serving. Come in, order some brisket or baby back ribs, take a seat, listen to the music, enjoy life for a while.Amber means last orders. Sometimes in BBQ these are the nest bits – they have been rested the longest and the server is usually eager to get home so you 200g of beef can easily become 250g.But wait, I said this saves you a drive? How do I see the traffic lights from my home? We thought of that – with a little magic we will make sure that the colour of the lights is reflected across all our social media and online presence.The Great Northern Larder Paradise BBQ BusA couple of years ago forest fires decimated Paradise in California. The city was a blackened char with almost everything burnt to the ground. If you look closely on Google satellite images from after the fire you can see a tiny patch of green – a spec in the middle of the devastation. This was the garden of a Volkswagen loving BBQ enthusiast. For reasons known only to the universe his garden and his VW bus were the only part of Paradise that was not taken. Unfortunately, he did lose his house but like most of the residents he was safely evacuated.The BBQ Bus is a 1971 ""micro-bus"" which was the 70s equivalent of a modern SUV. Note the melted indicator on the right hand side and the laminate (plastic) on the windscreen has also melted.Great Northern Larder had been on the lookout for a BBQ bus when we got a call telling us that there was a fire damaged bus available for sale in America. We exchanged photos and quickly realised this wasn’t an engine fire - it was something much more interesting. The fire had not damaged the bodywork at all, but it has melted the windows, the lights, and the dashboard. This machine was rad looking and just screamed BBQ bus. We imported it and right now it is being gently restored and converted by a company called Retro Food Trucks in County Meath.Although the BBQ Joint is a shipping container and technically mobile, the BBQ bus will allow us to move a little faster. We will be able to do off-site BBQs, promotions, and events. None of your money is required for the BBQ Bus – it is paid for already, but we thought it was important to mention as it will be a valuable contributor to the success of this project.Why is this a Good Investment?By helping us you are supporting a small Irish business and the jobs it provides. You are helping to bring real BBQ to Ireland. You are supporting one of the most unique food ideas we have seen on this island in a long time. Probably the best reason to support this BBQ joint is so as you can eat there!Our range of sauces - when you back this project remember that we are already well established in the food industry and we are putting our own reputation and money on the line in an big way.Laura and Ruairi have a good track record in the food industry. We have a large range of products that are for sale in the likes of Avoca and the big supermarkets. We have collaborated with many local businesses on e-commerce projects, menu designs, and product development. Last year we competed in the KCBS Irish barbecue championships and managed to come 2nd out of the Irish teams.How Can I Help?We need your financial support, but if you can’t do that then please help us by sharing this fundraiser on your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages. Send it to your local BBQ friends. Email it to your rich uncle. Thank you!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My coffee shop, Kamilah's Koffee, will offer the best quality coffee at affordable pricing for any class of customer that walks in the doors. We will work closely will local roasters to supply our coffee so that we can bring a sense of community to our shop. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking a total investment of up to $100,000. These funds will be entirely used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing a fixture that will be converted into a drive-thru/walk-up coffee shop with optional deck seating. This would also include the land purchase, permits, etc.</li>
<li>Equipment - everything from espresso machines and grinders, to cleaning supplies and floormats</li>
<li>Beginning inventory - mainly ingredients such as wholesale coffee, milk &amp; milk alternatives, syrups, etc.</li>
<li>Working capital - enough to leave a buffer for unexpected expenses that may come up in the first few months of operation</li>
<li>Payroll</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to bring a sense of community to my town and I plan to do this by working with local roasters and suppliers to enforce this idea. I, Jasmine, the Owner, have an exclusive history working in retail and customer service, totaling about 7 years experience. Since the day I started drinking coffee I have wanted to own my own coffee shop. When I moved up to Vancouver, WA in 2016 I started to pursue a business degree because I knew opening my coffee shop was the ultimate goal for me. I offer a great insight to customer service, sales and building a lasting rapport with customers and building trust for lasting relationships. We will be able to build a great team of reliable, hard-working and trustworthy team members who can help in creating personable lasting relationships with our customers - on top of serving delicious coffee.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I plan to put in all of my blood, sweat and tears into this business. Quitting my 9-5 job where I have a reliable income stream is risky in itself, but I fully intend to invest every minute of my time working at the shop to ensure things are running smoothly. The biggest challenge I anticipate facing is staffing - with COVID, it's hard to find people willing to work long hours and I will need at least 1 other person to be in it for the long run with me. Financially, I have a plan to make sure we can stay in business regardless of economic crises.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ricardo's story</p>
<p>I was born in Tucson, AZ, and I used to help my grandfather at fairs and such when I was a young buck and he would give me cash to play on some rides or games! As I got older, I noticed that it was hard to find churros made fresh and saw the potential we had immediately. I shared these feelings with my dad, and we got to work. My passion and motivation comes from the urge to continue my family tradition and to share fresh churros with the world!</p>
<p>About Just Churros:</p>
<p>Take a grandfather’s one-of-a-kind authentic churro recipe. Add a father’s legacy of passion and hard work. Blend in a grandson’s dedication and service. Sprinkle with just the right amount of cinnamon and the result is churros that are out of this world. That is how reviewers describe Just Churros: “out of this world fresh,” “absolutely the best churros on the planet. Mind blowing,” and “cinnamon heavenly goodness.”</p>
<p>As some might know I started Just Churros with my Dad August of 2012 with a dream to continue this legacy in our family alive for generations to come. He passed away October of 2019 due to a rare cancer called Neuroendocrine with many plans for this business. This was devastating news, both to the family and Just Churros. Our faith keeps us strong and even though it was our loss, it was heavens gain! (I love you and miss you Dad, thank you for all the life lessons you taught me)</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because as the 3rd generation churro maker in the family, I feel a responsibility to keep this legacy alive for my children and community of churro fans!</p>
<p>I am currently raising $30,000 for a new food truck designed specifically how we need it to be able to run things more efficient and safe so we can get around town with less worry and to better keep up with the demand at high traffic events. For every 22 dollars contributed, you can choose a perk for 2 dozens on your next visit to the current food truck in Tucson, AZ! You can also choose from Just Churros merch as well! If I don't reach the entire goal I will save the funds till I reach my current goal! I would like to keep this campaign open as long as it seems beneficial to my churro fans!</p>

<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Zohair Bajwa. I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan, and have been in Missoula since 2006. My friends and family will all tell you how much I enjoy sharing my culture through food – sharing the distinct tastes and smells of home with the people I love. Because of this, I have decided to embark on a new, exciting, and delicious endeavor – bringing the tastes of authentic Pakistani food to the Missoula community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope to bring Lahore’s authentic street food to the streets of Missoula and the surrounding area. My wife Megan and I are looking into securing a food trailer in which to prepare and serve up some delicious Pakistani food to tantalize your taste buds and keep you coming back for more. This is where your support and generosity comes in, and please allow me to thank you up front.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Community and Food</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ever since I came to Missoula in 2006 as a student at the University of Montana, there has always been something missing for me – good curries, and, more specifically, Pakistani food.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was deeply honored to have the chance to cook for my community through the United We Eat (“UWE”) program through Soft Landing Missoula last year. It was such a humbling experience – to see the excitement the Missoula community displayed for authentic Pakistani food. We ended up selling out 150 meals!</p>
<p><a href=""https://bit.ly/2YY7Y25"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://bit.ly/2YY7Y25</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I plan to bring the same love and passion to my food trailer as I did for the UWE program, and you can expect no compromises when it comes to using authentic spices and recipes, resulting in a whole new world of flavors for you to enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, once we are up and running and have firm footing in the Missoula food scene, we plan to give back to our Missoula neighbors, either by specials or discounted/free meals for various ones in the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What Foods to Expect</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Megan and I have had several conversations about a menu we believe would best bring the tastes of Lahore to the people of Missoula. During our trip home earlier this year, we explored different flavors that we think would work best to introduce to our community here. We will initially be serving:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chicken Karahi</strong>: traditionally cooked in a wok with tomatoes and spices, simmered to a thick sauce. Served best with naan and kachumar* (keto-friendly)</p>
<p><strong>Daal</strong>: orange lentils perfectly cooked to a stew-like consistency. Prepared with spices and served best over rice or naan (vegan, vegetarian friendly)</p>
<p><strong>Samosa</strong>: everyone knows about these delicious, fried concoctions!</p>
<p><strong>Paratha Rolls</strong>: a traditional grab-and-go street food from Pakistan. Chicken or vegetables cooked in spices, mixed with kachumar*, mint and tamarind chutneys, wrapped in a crispy paratha (fry bread).</p>
<p><strong>Shakar Qandi:</strong> My wife’s favorite snack in Lahore! Sweet potato mixed with freshly squeezed orange and spices. Traditionally served over newspaper (we won’t be doing that here, obviously – hello health code violation), and toothpicks.</p>
<p><strong>*Kachumar</strong>: sliced raw onions, raw tomatoes mixed with fresh lemon/lime juice, cilantro, salt and black pepper. A perfect accompaniment to any of the above-listed meals.</p>
<p><strong>Chutneys: </strong>Spicy mint chutney and a sweet and tangy tamarind chutney.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What You Get for Helping Fund This Project</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides having a local spot where you can try the delicious tastes of traditional and authentic Pakistani food, adding to Missoula’s food and cultural diversity, you can expect the listed rewards.</p>
<p>For any donations received from outside of Missoula area and if you cannot visit us when we're open, we will do our best to get your T-shirts mailed to you as soon we are able to. Also, if and when you're in Missoula, please come say hi and we will take care of you the only way we know- Pakistani hospitality style. For catering donations, we can certainly schedule a date where you will be in Missoula and would like to take advantage of that perk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Risks and Challenges</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Obviously, there is always a risk of failure, and to be honest, that risk is part of the reason why I have shied away from this endeavor until now. But I believe now is the time to make my dream a reality – now is the time for Missoula to experience authentic Pakistani food that is rich in flavor, made with love, and warms the soul.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During these extraordinary times in which we find ourselves, I understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially to this project. However, I would be very thankful for your support, encouragement, and patronage when we do open. I hope the people of Missoula are as excited as Megan and I are for this project, and I hope you will show your support by opening your hearts and your wallets to make this a success and help us add something new to your dining options!</p>

<p>We’re the company who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world. We want to make some amazing upgrades to our SousVide Supreme that will elevate the sous vide cooking experience to a whole new level.</p>

<p>The new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will have a similar look and feel to the iconic original SousVide Supreme, but with some innovative upgrades that will make it not only the most convenient sous vide machine to use, but the most advanced at-home sous vide machine there is. The Touch+ will include ingenious features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Responsive Touch Technology</b> – The new Touch+ has a control screen that you can navigate even with wet fingers. When your hands get wet from cooking—as they most surely will do—no problem! The new Touch+ will still respond perfectly. You can easily change the temperature, set the timer, or power it on or off.</li>
<li>
<b>A Clear View Lid</b> - SousVide Supreme users have never had to struggle with using ping-pong balls or aluminum foil tents or other extreme measures to keep in the heat. Our patented lid handled that beautifully. But now, that lid is fashioned of a single piece of molded clear plastic to let you see what’s going on, without lifting the lid and wasting valuable heat. All you have to do is look inside.</li>
<li>
<b>Energy Efficiency </b>- The Touch+ retains the energy efficient, cool-touch double-wall insulation of the original, so the water stays hot, but the machine stays cool to the touch. Once at temperature, the Touch+ uses only about the energy of a 20W light bulb. Safer for kids; better for the environment.</li>
<li>I<b>ntegrated Wifi</b> - You can control your Touch+ from anywhere with the newly integrated wifi. You can start and set your machine right from your phone and have the water bath at temperature and ready to go by the time you get home!</li>
<li>

<p>Sous vide? We’re glad you asked. The words literally mean “under vacuum” in French and they describe a cooking technique, first developed in France  in the 1970’s by Chef Georges Paulus; it relies on precise temperature control rather than great skill and perfect timing to achieve chef-worthy results. Food is vacuum-sealed and immersed in a precisely heated water bath to cook gently and perfectly. When you cook sous vide, your food develops deep flavors and textures that no other cooking method can duplicate.</p>
<p>While the term sous vide means “under vacuum”, you might just as well define it as “stunningly simple” especially when you use the Sous Vide Supreme Touch+. The sous vide cooking process boils down to three steps:</p>

<p><b>1. Season</b> - Season foods with your favorite herbs or spices.</p>
<p> <b>2. Seal</b> - Vacuum seal food in a food-grade cooking pouch.</p>
<p><b>3. Sous Vide</b> - Drop the sealed packages into the SousVide Supreme. No need for office clips, extra pots, Styrofoam coolers or ping-pong balls. The water oven does most of the work. Just set it and walk away!</p>

<p>We are the original innovators, who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world and our patented technology is unique. SousVide Supreme's award-winning technology and product design features a PID-controlled edge-to-edge heating element that blankets the bottom of the water oven. A perforated convection plate generates thermal currents for even temperature distribution. Our patented lid contains heat for energy efficiency, contains steam to prevent evaporation, and even serves as a tray for transporting pouches from the water oven to the stove or grill. It’s also a sleek and beautiful and counter-worthy machine.</p>
<p>The natural thermal circulation created by the design works with the basic physical properties of water to evenly heat the water to the target temperature throughout the bath, from top to bottom and corner to corner, without the need for a circulating propeller or pump. The precise temperature control gently brings the food to its ideal doneness and cooks it perfectly from edge to edge. Once brought to temperature, the efficient heat transfer capacity in our enclosed, self-contained system uses only about the energy of a 20 watt light bulb to precisely maintain the target temperature for hours or even days.</p>

<p>It's time to ditch your ""science project"" and step up to a state-of-the-art, serious sous vide appliance. Unlike circulator sticks, there is no remembering to put a hot pad down so your pot doesn't burn your counter, connecting a circulator to a pot, using an office clip to fasten a flimsy plastic bag to the side, and then creating a lid out of ping pong balls or foil to keep the heat in. No need to set the alarm to remember to add water lest the pot boil dry.</p>
<p>The revolutionary SousVide Supreme Touch+ is an all-in-one cooking appliance that will make it easier for cooks—from beginners to top chefs—to consistently prepare gourmet quality food at home and have more time do the other things they really love.</p>

<h1>Advantages of Sous Vide Cooking</h1>
<p>It goes without saying that the sous vide cooking technique will make you the envy of your friends, but the benefits go far deeper than mere peer adulation and they all come down to three things: better nutrition, free time, and more money. Here’s what’s in it for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Perfectly cooked food every time.</b> No more undercooked or overcooked food. The precise temperature control gently brings food to its ideal serving temperature and holds it there, so it stays perfectly cooked and ready to serve when you are ready to eat. Even if you get distracted. Even if you’re held up in traffic. Even if your guests are an hour late!</li>
<li>
<b>Simple to do. </b>Everything you need is in the box. No assembly required. Just add water and get cooking! Dial in edge-to-edge perfection at the push of a button and cook gourmet quality meals in three simple steps: Season – Seal - Sous vide.</li>
<li>
<b>Healthful, more nutritious meals.</b> The sous vide pouch locks in the flavor and lets the food cook in its natural juices, retaining all the water-soluble vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Important nutrients aren’t boiled off or steamed away like in conventional cooking. And vacuum sealing also protects the delicate, healthful essential fats from damaging oxidation. What you cook not only tastes better, it actually is better.</li>
<li>
<b>Consistent, reproducible results.</b> Effortlessly cook food just the way you like it every time – perfectly cooked steak, juicy chicken, tender-crisp vegetables bursting with flavor. Once you discover your preferences, just dial them in again and again for the same results. It’s the secret of the world’s top chefs that lets them make fabulous dishes, consistently delicious, night after night, for diner after diner and now it can be yours, too.</li>
<li>
<b>Save money!</b> Sous vide cooking lets you turn inexpensive, but flavorful, cuts of meat into gourmet delights as tender as filet mignon. You’ll never ruin a good steak again. You can make your own infused spirits and syrups for retro cocktails instead of buying expensive ones off the shelf. The savings go on and on!</li>

<h1>10 Things You Didn't Know You Could Cook with a Sous Vide Supreme</h1>
<p>1.<b> Ricotta Cheese/Yogurt</b> - The precisely-controlled water temperature makes cheese and yogurt-making effortless. Because the bath is unstirred, you can make them right in the water oven basin without a pouch.</p>
<p>2. <b>Condiments</b> - Use your imagination to develop your own condiments! Grainy mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot dill pickles, pickled summer veggies, and more. </p>
<p>3. <b>Cheesecake</b> - An unstirred sous vide bath is already the perfect <i>bain marie</i> for cooking traditional oven recipes requiring a water cushion and constant temperatures, like cheesecake, crème brûlée, or flan! Using a SousVide Supreme eliminates the challenge (and danger) of sloshing hot water onto the floor when filling or removing a pan from a traditional oven.</p>
<p>4. <b>The perfect egg</b> - Just set the temperature and put eggs in their shells directly into the water bath to cook and BAM—perfect poached eggs! And best of all, they’ll hold just as perfectly cooked for hours!</p>
<p>5. <b>Soup stock</b> - Use an unstirred water bath to make luscious bone broth or stock right in the water bath basin—no pouch required—to use for homemade soup or just to drink for good health!</p>
<p>6. <b>Custards and ice cream base</b> - No need for constant stirring to keep from scorching your custard on a stovetop. With sous vide you’ll be able to make perfect custard for homemade ice cream, crème brûlée, or flan, just like a pro.</p>
<p>7. <b>Overnight oatmeal</b> - Drop a pouch of oatmeal into the water oven at bedtime and it will be ready when you wake up. Say goodbye to that ‘no time for breakfast I’m just grabbing coffee’ excuse as you’re running out the door for work in the morning!</p>
<p>8. <b>Epic Bloody Mary</b> - Use the sous vide technique to create the perfect pickled vegetables—asparagus, okra, or green beans – for an epic Bloody Mary! You can even infuse the horseradish right into vodka in a matter of hours in a water oven.</p>
<p>9. <b>Gourmet vinegar</b> - Precise cooking temperatures help to quickly transfer flavor from herbs, spices, and berries without holding your kitchen hostage with that vinegar smell!</p>
<p>10.<b> Infused alcohols and syrups</b> - Traditionally made limoncello takes weeks or months to make. With sous vide, that timeline drops to hours or in some cases even minutes! The gentle heat speeds up the process of transferring natural flavors to the alcohol, helping you create old school cocktails on short notice for an impromptu dinner party!</p>

<div data-id=""17601879""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1504127362/v5bk36ip1wdxozhy8bbj.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>It all started with a pork chop. We (The Drs. Eades, <i>pere</i> and <i>mere</i>) had arrived late to a medical meeting in Las Vegas and were extraordinarily tired and hungry. We ordered a double-cut pork chop off the room service menu (in truth, with some slight reservations, because you’d expect a room service chop to be dried out and overcooked.) But when we took a bite, it was like no pork chop we had ever eaten: juicy and perfectly cooked from edge to edge with a golden crust on the surface. Simply divine! We were so surprised, we asked at the dining room how it was cooked and they told us ‘sous vide’. We vowed to find a machine that would replicate that chop.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We know food and cooking. We’ve owned a restaurant, written and hosted a 26-episode PBS television cooking show, authored a NY Times best-selling diet book, as well as being nutritional experts and physicians by trade. But it was through our quest to recreate that perfect pork chop that we discovered our passion for sous vide cooking. </p>
<p>Our first stab at cooking sous vide at home involved a DIY makeshift contraption that consisted of a large stock pot, balanced over the gas burner atop a simmering ring from an old wok, with a candy thermometer hooked to the side. The two of us kept watching minute-by-minute, adding ice cubes or hot water as needed throughout the hour-long cooking process to keep the temperature steady. Suffice it to say it wasn’t the most convenient method, but it worked and the steak we cooked was delicious! </p>
<p>We were convinced we had to have more of this sous vide cooked food, but neither of us willing to stand over the pot with ice cubes for an hour, so we scoured the internet trying to find a home sous vide machine. To our dismay, we found that the only sous vide cooking machines on the market were made for industrial labs or commercial kitchens, and the least expensive device was around $1,500 to $2,000. At the time, there was no device for the home cook, so we set about to make one. We assembled a team of designers, manufacturers, and culinary professionals and launched our dream to develop the first home sous vide machine, our original SousVide Supreme water oven, and to fulfill our mission to bring sous vide cooking to our home and to the masses.</p>

<p>Help us take your sous vide cooking to the next level! Join us to become a part of the SousVide Supreme community!</p>
</div></div>","From the company that revolutionized cooking with the first at-home sous vide, the original SousVide Supreme, comes the next chapter in sous vide cooking.

With your help our new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will revolutionize sous vide cooking once again.

We’re the company who brought sous vide cooking to home kitchens around the world. We want to make some amazing upgrades to our SousVide Supreme that will elevate the sous vide cooking experience to a whole new level.

The new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will have a similar look and feel to the iconic original SousVide Supreme, but with some innovative upgrades that will make it not only the most convenient sous vide machine to use, but the most advanced at-home sous vide machine there is. The Touch+ will include ingenious features such as:


Responsive Touch Technology – The new Touch+ has a control screen that you can navigate even with wet fingers. When your hands get wet from cooking—as they most surely will do—no problem! The new Touch+ will still respond perfectly. You can easily change the temperature, set the timer, or power it on or off.

A Clear View Lid - SousVide Supreme users have never had to struggle with using ping-pong balls or aluminum foil tents or other extreme measures to keep in the heat. Our patented lid handled that beautifully. But now, that lid is fashioned of a single piece of molded clear plastic to let you see what’s going on, without lifting the lid and wasting valuable heat. All you have to do is look inside.

Energy Efficiency - The Touch+ retains the energy efficient, cool-touch double-wall insulation of the original, so the water stays hot, but the machine stays cool to the touch. Once at temperature, the Touch+ uses only about the energy of a 20W light bulb. Safer for kids; better for the environment.
Integrated Wifi - You can control your Touch+ from anywhere with the newly integrated wifi. You can start and set your machine right from your phone and have the water bath at temperature and ready to go by the time you get home!

A new state-of-the-art app - Connect with people who love cooking as much as you do. You can program your new Touch+ with recipes you find on social media, and then upload pictures of your finished dish to your favorite social platforms to show everyone how it all turned out!

Alexa compatibility - Unlike circulator sticks, the counter-worthy SousVide Supreme Touch+ is always ready to go! It’s there, sitting pretty on your countertop, right at home next to your espresso machine and with water already in it. All you have to do is tell Alexa to turn it on! You don’t even have to push a button.

It all started with a pork chop. We (The Drs. Eades, pere and mere) had arrived late to a medical meeting in Las Vegas and were extraordinarily tired and hungry. We ordered a double-cut pork chop off the room service menu (in truth, with some slight reservations, because you’d expect a room service chop to be dried out and overcooked.) But when we took a bite, it was like no pork chop we had ever eaten: juicy and perfectly cooked from edge to edge with a golden crust on the surface. Simply divine! We were so surprised, we asked at the dining room how it was cooked and they told us ‘sous vide’. We vowed to find a machine that would replicate that chop.


We know food and cooking. We’ve owned a restaurant, written and hosted a 26-episode PBS television cooking show, authored a NY Times best-selling diet book, as well as being nutritional experts and physicians by trade. But it was through our quest to recreate that perfect pork chop that we discovered our passion for sous vide cooking. 
Our first stab at cooking sous vide at home involved a DIY makeshift contraption that consisted of a large stock pot, balanced over the gas burner atop a simmering ring from an old wok, with a candy thermometer hooked to the side. The two of us kept watching minute-by-minute, adding ice cubes or hot water as needed throughout the hour-long cooking process to keep the temperature steady. Suffice it to say it wasn’t the most convenient method, but it worked and the steak we cooked was delicious! 
We were convinced we had to have more of this sous vide cooked food, but neither of us willing to stand over the pot with ice cubes for an hour, so we scoured the internet trying to find a home sous vide machine. To our dismay, we found that the only sous vide cooking machines on the market were made for industrial labs or commercial kitchens, and the least expensive device was around $1,500 to $2,000. At the time, there was no device for the home cook, so we set about to make one. We assembled a team of designers, manufacturers, and culinary professionals and launched our dream to develop the first home sous vide machine, our original SousVide Supreme water oven, and to fulfill our mission to bring sous vide cooking to our home and to the masses.

Our SousVide Supreme has received international acclaim - check out what others have said:

Timeline
We have been working on a redesign of the original SousVide Supreme since September 2016. We have built a physical prototype without the wifi capabilities.
Our next steps are to design and develop the application and wifi technology, including Alexa integration.
Our whole family is passionate about sous vide cooking. Our passion became a fledgling company that originated the home sous vide category and became the global market leader. Now we want to build on that dream to make sous vide cooking easier, sexier, and more fun! In short, we want to revolutionize sous vide cooking once again. Our new SousVide Supreme Touch+ will offer a simpler and more connected cooking experience for you and our whole global sous vide foodie community. The money that we raise will go toward the engineering, design, and development of the new hardware and software of the product.

<h3>About the Brewery</h3>
<p>Eluvium Brewing Company will be Weaverville's first tap room with an outdoor patio. We're on a mission to put session-style beers on the map. We don't think beer needs to be big on ABV to be big on flavor. With our beers, our goal is on bringing our community together and providing a place for people to gather, be social, and enjoy a pint. </p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502744032/k5o5vae5o0nyazyjcnc4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hey! We're Jon and Shea, the founders and owners of Eluvium Brewing Company and as you may have guessed, we love beer! We also love the awesome community of Weaverville and everything this great, little town has to offer. Shea is a North Carolina Native, born and raised in Sylva, and Jon is originally from Ohio and decided to settle down in the Asheville area almost two and a half years ago after years of nomadding around. Now, we not only call Weaverville our home but, home to Eluvium brewing company.</p>
<h3>What is Eluvium?</h3>
<p>Picking a name for a brewery is tough. Since we didn't think Varner Brewing Company was very catchy, we decided to look to history to help us find a name. North Carolina is rich in history and one thing that caught our attention was that North Carolina had its own gold rush. In fact, the North Carolina gold rush predates the California gold rush by almost 50 years. According to most accounts, it all started at Reed's Mine in Carbarrus County, North Carolina when a 12-year-old boy discovered a 17-pound gold nugget while out fishing one day. North Carolina went on to be the leading producer of gold in the country until the discovery in California in 1849. People even had more faith in coins from the Bechtler Mint, North Carolinas premier mint, than that of the U.S. Government mints.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with Eluvium? Well, eluvium or eluvial gold placer deposits are gold deposits that derive from in place weathering where the surrounding soil and sediment is washed away leaving the rich heavy gold deposits behind. These deposits are typically closer to the source where you would find the larger gold nuggets.  </p>
<p>So, in our own little quest for gold, or in our case, gold medal worthy beer, we chose to call ourselves Eluvium Brewing Company. And we want to make beer that people not only enjoy drinking but, beer that our supporters and community can call their own. We hope you can stop in and claim your beer soon!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help for our final push to opening. With all of the delays to finishing the brewery construction it has really become a burden financially and our credit cards can only go so far. While we have and will continue to do as much of the work as we can ourselves we've put a lot of money into our build out and we're driving on but, contractors are expensive. The money we raise with this campaign will go towards the final build out costs, pint glasses and tap room supplies, and first batch ingredients for our beers.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As in any adventure, there are plenty of hurdles and challenges we all face, opening a brewery is definitely no exception. This becomes especially challenging when you take on the venture of opening a brewery with just two people. The various permits at almost every level of government, construction, building inspections, sourcing equipment, sourcing ingredients, and all of that is before you can even brew a single barrel of beer! All of these can add delays and push our opening back and delays cost money.</p>
<p>We have already acquired our Federal Brewer's Notice which is typically a big hang up for a new brewery. Unfortunately, we can't get the others until the building is ready and inspected (which this campaign will help us do!). Building delays have not only pushed back our time line but, have taken a huge toll on our bank account. Finance costs, loan payments, equipment leasing, and contractor payments add up fast. And then of the unexpected expenses are another battle. We are doing our best to predict every little expense, down to the ounce of hops, but, you never can predict everything.</p>
<p>We're putting everything we have into this brewery, just the two of us. We've opted against investors because we don't want to have to answer to anyone but our beer drinking supporters. Because of this dedication to you and the beer we must stretch our resources as far as they can go and not be afraid to reach out for help when we need it. Fortunately, Weaverville is a great community and we've had a lot of help from our friends. Now we just need your help to push us across the finish line and help us get our doors open so we can start pouring pints to supporters like you!</p>

</div></div>","About the Brewery
Eluvium Brewing Company will be Weaverville's first tap room with an outdoor patio. We're on a mission to put session-style beers on the map. We don't think beer needs to be big on ABV to be big on flavor. With our beers, our goal is on bringing our community together and providing a place for people to gather, be social, and enjoy a pint. 
Who we are

Hey! We're Jon and Shea, the founders and owners of Eluvium Brewing Company and as you may have guessed, we love beer! We also love the awesome community of Weaverville and everything this great, little town has to offer. Shea is a North Carolina Native, born and raised in Sylva, and Jon is originally from Ohio and decided to settle down in the Asheville area almost two and a half years ago after years of nomadding around. Now, we not only call Weaverville our home but, home to Eluvium brewing company.
What is Eluvium?
Picking a name for a brewery is tough. Since we didn't think Varner Brewing Company was very catchy, we decided to look to history to help us find a name. North Carolina is rich in history and one thing that caught our attention was that North Carolina had its own gold rush. In fact, the North Carolina gold rush predates the California gold rush by almost 50 years. According to most accounts, it all started at Reed's Mine in Carbarrus County, North Carolina when a 12-year-old boy discovered a 17-pound gold nugget while out fishing one day. North Carolina went on to be the leading producer of gold in the country until the discovery in California in 1849. People even had more faith in coins from the Bechtler Mint, North Carolinas premier mint, than that of the U.S. Government mints.
What does this have to do with Eluvium? Well, eluvium or eluvial gold placer deposits are gold deposits that derive from in place weathering where the surrounding soil and sediment is washed away leaving the rich heavy gold deposits behind. These deposits are typically closer to the source where you would find the larger gold nuggets.  
So, in our own little quest for gold, or in our case, gold medal worthy beer, we chose to call ourselves Eluvium Brewing Company. And we want to make beer that people not only enjoy drinking but, beer that our supporters and community can call their own. We hope you can stop in and claim your beer soon!

What We Need & What You Get
We need your help for our final push to opening. With all of the delays to finishing the brewery construction it has really become a burden financially and our credit cards can only go so far. While we have and will continue to do as much of the work as we can ourselves we've put a lot of money into our build out and we're driving on but, contractors are expensive. The money we raise with this campaign will go towards the final build out costs, pint glasses and tap room supplies, and first batch ingredients for our beers. We've come a long way since this adventure started and your support will get us across the finish line and open our doors so we can share our joy of beer with you! Here are a few pics of where we're at and where we've been with the brewery.

</div> <p>Hi!  My name is Christian.  I was born in 1972.  I became vegan in 1997.  eden-a vegan cafe came to life in 2008 in Downtown Scranton, PA.  With your help, eden-a vegan cafe's Storybook, Vegan Guidebook and Cookbook will be created and published NOW!  </p>
<p>In my almost 18 years of veganism, I have learned so much from so many.  I have taken everything I have learned and spent my life sharing it with others.  The opportunities I have had to help others with their health, their compassionate journey towards veganism, and simply helping people learn about all things vegan and how they can incorporate them into their life has been a blessing that I am truly grateful for and I embrace any and every chance to promote a better way of living! </p>

<br/><p>The opportunities that have come through eden-a vegan cafe have been amazing.  Of course we have been able to serve 100% vegan food to so, so, so many people, the majority of whom are not vegan or vegetarian, and we have been able to open so many eyes and hearts by way of the belly!  The cafe has also opened doors for me to speak to so many groups about all things vegan, from elementary students to high school students, colleges and universities, church groups, large corporations, small businesses, health clubs and many other organizations.  It's been a wonderful experience.  I have appeared many times on a local lifestyle show ""PA LIVE!"" doing cooking segments and talking about vegan foods, and did a cooking demo for a ""Vegan Thanksgiving 101"" at the Scranton Cultural Center that was very well attended and also televised.  </p>
<p>I want to share the story of my journey and the story of eden with all of you, and incorporate that into the eden cookbook that so many folks have been asking me to put out for a few years now.  We have 6 years of recipes from eden-a vegan cafe, 18 years of recipes from me personally, a wonderful story to tell about how I came to veganism and how eden came to be, and also so much vegan info and knowledge, advice, tips and tricks to share with everyone through this three part book!!    All of us at eden believe in sharing everything that is good with everyone, so it is time to share our story, our knowledge and our recipes, with everyone!  </p>

<h2>WHO IS ROOTED DELIGHTS?</h2>
<p>Greetings Rooted Family!! My name is Janay Jones, founder of Rooted Delights, a local vegan cheez and cuisine company. When I became vegan in 2016, the hardest thing to give up was cheese. It was something that I loved, but it didn't quite love me. I knew if I was struggling, then others had to be too! This is when Rooted Delights was created! With a lot of late nights, trials and errors, and lots of tears, we finally perfected our first product, 'Mild Cheddah Cheez'. Shortly after the release of our ‘Cheddah’, we began working on a mozzarella style cheese which we call our 'Creamy Mozzah Cheez'. With the continuous rise and awareness of veganism, we are hoping to shift minds and take this local vegan cheez company to the next level.</p>

<p>With dairy farms contributing to the slaughter of more than 245,000 dairy cows per year, this vile industry where animals are neglected, caged, and abused is far from humane. The sole purpose of cows milk is to turn a 65-pound calf into a 700 pound cow as fast as possible, dairy milk isn't intended for us to consume. No other species of the planet consumes the milk of another species, except humans. Not only that, but a whopping 75% of the people of the planet are lactose intolerant, wow! In the US, 750 million pus cells are allowed in every liter of milk, in some countries the amount of pus allowed is limitless.

<h2> </h2>
<p>Business is growing rapidly, forcing us to scale to the next level. We have been approached by major retail grocers and restaurants but with our limited shared kitchen space and residential style equipment, we aren't able to mass produce and keep up with the demand. But with your help, we can purchase commercial equipment and secure a building space for our own co-packing facility. By funding Rooted Delights, you are not only helping us with the purchase of equipment and space, but also helping us with the production of more vegan cheez flavors! We plan on releasing our locally loved and over anticipated  'O-Queso' along with pepper jack, swiss, and smoked gouda cheez wheels.</p>

<h2><strong>Risk &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Some major challenges we have faced throughout our journey thus far is mass production. We have not successfully been able to mass produce the cheez at a fast enough pace to keep up with the demand.  We have looked at co-packing and manufacturing facilities, however majority of these spaces also produce or may contain eggs, nuts, soy and wheat all on the same equipment which is a huge risk for cross contamination. Our goal is to scale this business but we also want to keep our products consistent and completely allergen free. Due to the high demand, we would like to allocate our day to day tasks so that we can focus on marketing, networking and expansion. This too has become a challenge since we aren't able to produce more product, however if we were, it would bring in more revenue to benefit, develop and expand our team. Even though we are faced with these challenges and risks, we know we can overcome majority of these problems with proper funding and space to maintain a quality grade product in an allergen free environment.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We need approximately $47,000 USD to take our business to the next level! Below is a breakdown to where your funding will go. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Equipment</u> - We need large commercial blenders, refrigerators, racks, molds, shredders and slicers which cost around $20,000.00. With this equipment we can produce at a much faster speed and adequately distribute all over the U.S. </li>
<li>
<u>Space</u>- We have looked at countless small buildings to call home but with the overhead fees being so expensive we have struggled with currently committing to an actual facility.  We would love the opportunity to eventually create our own co-packing facility right here in Richmond, VA. However in our development stages, we would feel more comfortable beginning our journey with a trial facility until finding the perfect home to build our business.  We anticipate leasing a facility to average approximately $15,000 for a year.</li>
<li>
<u>Marketing, Research &amp; Development</u> - In order to get the word out, it is vital to hire and partner with a team of people that can promote and engage others from all over the world regarding our brand and to help increase revenue. We plan on utilizing our early adopters to assist with our target audience and assist with expanding our market.  We also plan to improve our shelf life so that our cheez can be enjoyed with longevity. We have found the perfect Marketing team to partner with, however it will cost approximately $10,000 to get started.</li>
<li>
<u>Product Design &amp; Packaging</u>- With releasing more products we will need to hire a team who can assist in developing quality packaging designs and materials that can be sustainable and environmentally friendly yet sturdy. This may cost our team approximately $2,000-$3,000. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p>I love almond butter. I’ve probably tried every almond butter brand out there, but I had never found one that I quite loved. Some are almost flavorless while others are way too sugary and oily. And the brands that offer exciting flavors are filled with too many unnatural ingredients and artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the summer of 2020. In the midst of quarantine and Corona lockdowns, I decided to take on a project: create the perfect nut butter – one that is delicious and fun yet also nutritious. I took out my parents’ Cuisinart food processor, started grinding (no pun intended), and Made By Blu was born.</p>
<p>Four months and two food processors later, I have now created the most unique nut butters out there, including flavors like S’mores Almond Butter and Animal Cracker Crunch Cashew Butter. I decided my creation was simply too good to keep to myself. I started selling locally to friends and family, and eventually expanded to selling nationwide via Instagram and my website (MadeByBlu.com). Operating as a one-woman show out of Cleveland, Made By Blu generated over $8,000 in sales and reached the hands of over 200 customers in just three short months.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606330506/xf2y6urte7rgqbuxoroo.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our customers<strong> love</strong> us. In fact, some customers even re-ordered SIX times in the span of three months, but don’t take my word for it…hear it from them!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606277867/www3joqlmnh5efuive5s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>I want everyone to feel this passionate about Made By Blu and try just how delicious our nut butters are, but we need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What is Made By Blu?</strong></h2>
<p>This delicious nut butter spread is unlike any other almond butter or cashew butter on the market. Most brands are either too bland and boring or too artificial and unhealthy. Made By Blu combines the best of both worlds, creating nut butters that consist of transparent, nutritious ingredients in the base product and then mixing in fun and exciting add-ins.</p>
<p>Other competing brands are filled with unnatural, unhealthy, and unnecessary ingredients, such as whey protein, palm oil, and xylitol sweetener (how do you even pronounce that?!). Some of these competitors can’t even legally call themselves nut butters as their products are made of only 45% nuts…imposters! Not Made By Blu though! Each Made By Blu nut butter is carefully crafted with your well-being and taste buds in mind. For example, our Animal Cracker Crunch Almond Butter only consists of almonds, a drizzle of honey, a dash of vanilla extract, and crushed up pieces of your favorite childhood snack – frosted animal crackers.</p>
<p>We aim to eventually certify each Made By Blu spread as gluten-free and non-GMO.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606278011/bkbhn0bpfovkpt5o8ooh.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Made By Blu nut butters are a great source of vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, and healthy fats with a side of FUN. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be boring. With Made By Blu you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread it on toast</li>
<li>Eat it on top of yogurt or oatmeal</li>
<li>Drizzle it on pancakes</li>
<li>Blend it into smoothies</li>
<li>Bake it into cookies, breads, and muffins</li>
<li>Make fun treats with it</li>
<li>Eat it by the spoonful!</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless with Made By Blu! No matter how you choose to enjoy it, it will leave you 100% satisfied and coming back for seconds…or even thirds.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606279523/yxu4xfvkmg8gmakkvhl6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Made By Blu is a viable business. We have a plan for manufacturing and fulfillment, and now all we need is your donations to start production! While we may experience some logistical challenges and certain nuances during this first round of production, by working with a professional co-packer, if any issue happens to arise, we have plans in place to mitigate and minimize any potential disruptions.</p>
<p>As a shelf-stable product, shipping Made By Blu nut butters is not risky. The Made By Blu team is dedicated to ensuring that each customer receives their chosen perk. In the case of any unexpected delay, we will certainly keep you updated and informed. No matter what, we promise that our bakers will receive their jars of Made by Blu as soon as they are ready.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>Where You Come In</strong></h2>
<p>Launching a new food startup is not easy, but we are determined to see this through. With your help and support, we will be able to finance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recipe testing to perfect the current Made By Blu recipe</li>
<li>Ingredient sourcing</li>
<li>Nutritional analysis</li>
<li>Water Activity Level Testing to ensure shelf-life stability</li>
<li>Creating FDA compliant packaging</li>
</ul>
<p>This behind the scenes stuff may seem boring, but it is critical in getting Made By Blu off the ground. Before we officially launch our first Made By Blu nut butter, we want to make sure that it is crafted to perfection. That means we are working hard to perfect the taste, the flavor, the ingredients, the certifications, the nutrition facts  - everything! We want our customers to fall in love with Made By Blu!</p>

<h2><strong>About Fiona</strong></h2>
<p>I have always had this go-getter attitude, so when I told my parents that I wanted to turn this summer hobby of mine into a real business, they were not surprised in the slightest.</p>
<p>In all honestly, being a full-time business student at Washington University in St. Louis and starting up my own company all at the same time has not been easy, but I’m confident that it will be 100% worth it. As a young female, I’ve realized that most of us are far too consumed with our diets. Over the last few years, I’ve come to understand just how important it is to find a balance between nourishment and enjoyment. There have been periods of my life where I’ve gone too far on either side of the spectrum – either eating only fruits, veggies, and lean proteins (BORINGGG!) or eating solely junk food and sweets (Was I asking for a sugar crash!?). After much experimentation and soul-searching, I realized that being too far on either side of the spectrum is neither a sustainable nor healthy lifestyle. What I had been looking for all along was balance.</p>
<p>My love for nut butters coupled with this new-found realization of mine ultimately led to the creation of Made By Blu Nut Butters. I wanted to create a nut butter that truly encapsulated this idea of balance. In my opinion, I achieved just that – with each Made By Blu nut butter containing both nourishing ingredients and indulgent mix-ins! Maybe I won’t change the world with my go-getter attitude, but I might be onto something when it comes to the nut butter industry.</p>

I took out my parents’ Cuisinart food processor, started grinding (no pun intended), and Made By Blu was born.
Four months and two food processors later, I have now created the most unique nut butters out there, including flavors like S’mores Almond Butter and Animal Cracker Crunch Cashew Butter. I decided my creation was simply too good to keep to myself. I started selling locally to friends and family, and eventually expanded to selling nationwide via Instagram and my website (MadeByBlu.com). Operating as a one-woman show out of Cleveland, Made By Blu generated over $8,000 in sales and reached the hands of over 200 customers in just three short months.

 
Our customers love us. In fact, some customers even re-ordered SIX times in the span of three months, but don’t take my word for it…hear it from them!


 
I want everyone to feel this passionate about Made By Blu and try just how delicious our nut butters are, but we need your help.
 
What is Made By Blu?
This delicious nut butter spread is unlike any other almond butter or cashew butter on the market. Most brands are either too bland and boring or too artificial and unhealthy. Made By Blu combines the best of both worlds, creating nut butters that consist of transparent, nutritious ingredients in the base product and then mixing in fun and exciting add-ins.
Other competing brands are filled with unnatural, unhealthy, and unnecessary ingredients, such as whey protein, palm oil, and xylitol sweetener (how do you even pronounce that?!). Some of these competitors can’t even legally call themselves nut butters as their products are made of only 45% nuts…imposters! Not Made By Blu though! Each Made By Blu nut butter is carefully crafted with your well-being and taste buds in mind. For example, our Animal Cracker Crunch Almond Butter only consists of almonds, a drizzle of honey, a dash of vanilla extract, and crushed up pieces of your favorite childhood snack – frosted animal crackers.
We aim to eventually certify each Made By Blu spread as gluten-free and non-GMO.


Made By Blu nut butters are a great source of vitamin E, magnesium, potassium, and healthy fats with a side of FUN. Eating healthy doesn’t have to be boring. With Made By Blu you can:

Spread it on toast
Eat it on top of yogurt or oatmeal
Drizzle it on pancakes
Blend it into smoothies
Bake it into cookies, breads, and muffins
Make fun treats with it
Eat it by the spoonful!

The possibilities are endless with Made By Blu! No matter how you choose to enjoy it, it will leave you 100% satisfied and coming back for seconds…or even thirds.

 

Risks & Challenges
Made By Blu is a viable business. We have a plan for manufacturing and fulfillment, and now all we need is your donations to start production! While we may experience some logistical challenges and certain nuances during this first round of production, by working with a professional co-packer, if any issue happens to arise, we have plans in place to mitigate and minimize any potential disruptions.
As a shelf-stable product, shipping Made By Blu nut butters is not risky. The Made By Blu team is dedicated to ensuring that each customer receives their chosen perk. In the case of any unexpected delay, we will certainly keep you updated and informed. No matter what, we promise that our bakers will receive their jars of Made by Blu as soon as they are ready.
 

Where You Come In
Launching a new food startup is not easy, but we are determined to see this through. With your help and support, we will be able to finance:

Recipe testing to perfect the current Made By Blu recipe
Ingredient sourcing
Nutritional analysis
Water Activity Level Testing to ensure shelf-life stability
Creating FDA compliant packaging

This behind the scenes stuff may seem boring, but it is critical in getting Made By Blu off the ground. Before we officially launch our first Made By Blu nut butter, we want to make sure that it is crafted to perfection. That means we are working hard to perfect the taste, the flavor, the ingredients, the certifications, the nutrition facts  - everything! We want our customers to fall in love with Made By Blu!
 
About Fiona
I have always had this go-getter attitude, so when I told my parents that I wanted to turn this summer hobby of mine into a real business, they were not surprised in the slightest.
In all honestly, being a full-time business student at Washington University in St. Louis and starting up my own company all at the same time has not been easy, but I’m confident that it will be 100% worth it. As a young female, I’ve realized that most of us are far too consumed with our diets. Over the last few years, I’ve come to understand just how important it is to find a balance between nourishment and enjoyment. There have been periods of my life where I’ve gone too far on either side of the spectrum – either eating only fruits, veggies, and lean proteins (BORINGGG!) or eating solely junk food and sweets (Was I asking for a sugar crash!?). After much experimentation and soul-searching, I realized that being too far on either side of the spectrum is neither a sustainable nor healthy lifestyle. What I had been looking for all along was balance.
My love for nut butters coupled with this new-found realization of mine ultimately led to the creation of Made By Blu Nut Butters. I wanted to create a nut butter that truly encapsulated this idea of balance. In my opinion, I achieved just that – with each Made By Blu nut butter containing both nourishing ingredients and indulgent mix-ins! Maybe I won’t change the world with my go-getter attitude, but I might be onto something when it comes to the nut butter industry.

<p>We want to thank you so much for taking the time to check out our kickstarter.</p>
<p>My name is Rob Cox , I am the Founder and President of RIMIT. People ask me all the time, ""How did you come up with this idea?"" The honest truth is, one day in August 2018, I woke up at 3am and the exact vision of what RIMIT is today was in my head. My guess would be after years of suffering from drinking Caesars from a can without rimmer, the universe worked its magic and gave me the solution to my problem. </p>
<p>Although my background had been in the Landscaping industry for the previous 15 years, I had always been an entrepreneur, owning  businesses in different categories such as a Real estate Investing in Canada and Nicaragua, Granite Counter Tops and few others so I knew extensive research was needed to determine if we should pursue the idea of RIMIT. We quickly realized there may just be a high demand for RIMIT. The problem that we solved with RIIMIT wasn’t just so that consumers could now add rimmer to there canned cocktails but they could now enjoy a fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. And they can do this without their lips having to come in contact with germ covered cans.</p>
<p>But RIMIT was just the beginning. We quickly discovered that there was another problem that we needed to solve. In order to be able to enjoy a fully rimmed cocktail anywhere, anytime in just seconds, the lime juice and rimmer needs to be readily available. It just takes too much time and makes too much mess to have to get out the bowls, rimmer, lime juice and pour them into the bowls just to rim up a couple of cocktails. Then once your done, you now have rimmer and lime juice that both go to waste and you have dishes to do.</p>
<p>The Solution was The RIMIT Kit. Our patent pending 2 in 1 compact, leak-proof rimmer kit allows you to rim up your cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. </p>
<p>The idea of The RIMIT Kit was born just a couple months after RIMIT but The RIMIT Kit needed about 18 months of R&amp;D to get it just perfect. The original thought of The RIMIT Kit would be a small compact 2 in 1 rimmer kit that could fit in your pocket and would only be compatible with the RIMIT. After 18 months of R&amp;D, it was clear that we had to make it just big enough to be compatible with any standard household drinking glass and of course, RIMIT. But it still had to be compact, leak-proof and easily transportable. Not like the standard bar top rimmer trays. So we ended up with this! </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our patent and Trade Mark pending products both RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit were invented to provide more convenience and a quicker solution for preparing fully rimmed cocktails anywhere, anytime in just seconds. All of our products are Made with FDA approved polypropylene, they are BPA Free, Dish Washer Friendly, Recyclable but more importantly they are Reusable. We encourage our customers to wash and reuse our products to minimize waste.</p>
<p>The RIMIT Kit comes with 130 Grams of co-branded Lucky’s Rim Job Rimmer. All you have to do is add 1 ounce of lime juice to the lime juice compartment. The RIMIT Kit can be easily transported via cooler bags, back packs, purses ect. It loves to be stored in the fridge to keep the lime juice fresh. </p>
<p>In todays busy world, there never seems to be enough time in a day. To us, it makes more sense to spend less time preparing cocktails and creating dishes and spend more time enjoying your favorite cocktails with friends and family.</p>
<p>So whether your looking to enjoy a Caesar, Michelada, Margarita, Bloody Mary at home, at the cottage, the beach, camping, golfing or backyard get togethers, RIMIT and The RIMIT Kit allows you to conveniently enjoy fully rimmed cocktails in just seconds.</p>
<p>We officially launched RIMIT in August 2019 and sales plus co-branded partnerships have taken off for us including a collaboration with Mott’s Clamato Caesar’s. Now it is time to introduce The RIMIT Kit. We have already selected our Manufacturer and our moulds are currently being fabricated. We are on schedule to be in full production by the middle of August this year and now we need your help to get our first manufacturing run off the ground so please back this campaign so we can launch The RIMIT Kit and Elevate your cocktail experience.</p>
<p>With the help of the Kickstarter community, we will launch not only The RIMIT Kit, but also a company that designs and manufactures products that empower you to create unforgettable experiences.</p>

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>As you can see on the timeline, we have been working on this product for more than a year, and have already completed the design / development and have moved forward on the process of creating all the molds, fixtures, and processes needed for mass production. <br/> <br/>Here are a few risks and challenges that we can think of:  </p>
<p>Product Manufacturing Delays  </p>
<p>We’ve produced a small run of samples and we feel confident that a large production order will be successful; however, it is common that factories can have unforeseen setbacks. We plan to stay in constant communication with our manufacturer including working on-site to resolve any challenges that may arise.  </p>
<p>Shipping Delays  </p>
<p>As with any manufactured good, delays can happen -- a typhoon can hit, or a pallet can get stuck in a shipyard. We’ve padded our schedule to accommodate some changes, but will let our backers know immediately if we foresee any updates to the timeline for delivery.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Drip Drop Drink is a coffee bar located in Downtown Muskegon, Michigan. We specialize in handcrafted coffee beverages using high-quality, ethically-sourced coffee beans. We believe the coffee should be the star of the show so we keep all the fancy flavors and syrups to a minimum. You could say that we're coffee focused.</p>
<p>We have been serving Downtown Muskegon for nearly 5 years from our little 200 square foot shop. With the downtown finally starting to grow we have been given the opportunity to open a shop in another building - a much bigger space that we wont have to share with several other businesses. That means that we can really dial-in the coffee experience for each and every one of our customers. </p>
<p>Our plan is to offer our customers a few breakfast options beyond just pastries. We may even do a little light lunch offering. Rest assured though as our main focus will continue to be to offer the very best coffee around - something that we will never change here at Drip Drop Drink.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $25,000 or more. This cost will help cover the purchase of additional equipment (which includes but is not limited to a new espresso machine, a convection oven, new furniture and fixtures) and build-out costs associated with a new space (electrical, plumbing).</p>
<p>We have a wide array of perks available for all levels of supporters. From coffee to t-shirts to unique classes and experiences.</p>
<p>We chose flexible funding because even if we don't reach 100% our goal, every dollar counts! We estimate the entire project will surpass the $40,000 mark but the campaign goal of $25,000 is what we need to get into the space and operating.  If we don't reach our goal through this campaign we will still strive to find other affordable avenues to generate enough funds to make the new space a reality. </p>

</div><div>
<p>A coffee shop is so much more than a place you can go to get your caffeine fix. It is a place for you to feel welcome, a place for you to be comfortable, it is a place to meet your friends for coffee or make new ones over coffee. We want Drip Drop Drink to be your place.</p>
<p>We need your help to succeed. Your contribution to this campaign is invaluable. Whether you give monetarily or just choose to share on your social media pages, you are helping to make Drip Drop Drink a community place for many years to come. That means the world to us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We launched Drip Drop Drink in Downtown Muskegon before there was much reason to come downtown. Our first winter was tough and had us questioning whether we made the right decision. It hasn't always been smooth sailing but nearly five years later you have helped prove that Downtown Muskegon is the perfect choice for a specialty coffee shop and we are grateful for your continued support.</p>
<p>Now we find ourselves needing to expand and change (ever so slightly) to meet the demands of a growing downtown. We love our neighbors at the Russell Block building but it's time for our own space. We have shown that we have the determination and the tenacity to face challenges and overcome them.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that some of you aren't able to contribute financially but please consider making a solid effort to help us spread the word.

<p>#FEEDING NIGERIANS FROM STARVATION AND AVERT  FAMINE.</p>
<p>The World should Intervene Now in Nigeria's Food Crisis. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;'>It is true that Nigerians are hungry and starving, due to shortages and high prices of food, arising from past neglect of agriculture.Urgent interventions are thus needed to avert famine in Nigeria, the African nation of over 170 million people.</span></p>
<p>     A short and long term solution is to develop the country's agriculture, to INCREASE FOOD SUPPLIES to feed the nation and avert a humanitarian disaster.</p>
<p>     My name is Henry, the Promoter of BANKOLE LAOTAN FARMS in Ibadan,Nigeria. The farm has 100 acres of land, to grow corn, rice and cassava, which are staple foods eaten all over Nigeria.</p>

#FEEDING NIGERIANS FROM STARVATION AND AVERT  FAMINE.
The World should Intervene Now in Nigeria's Food Crisis. It is true that Nigerians are hungry and starving, due to shortages and high prices of food, arising from past neglect of agriculture.Urgent interventions are thus needed to avert famine in Nigeria, the African nation of over 170 million people.
     A short and long term solution is to develop the country's agriculture, to INCREASE FOOD SUPPLIES to feed the nation and avert a humanitarian disaster.
     My name is Henry, the Promoter of BANKOLE LAOTAN FARMS in Ibadan,Nigeria. The farm has 100 acres of land, to grow corn, rice and cassava, which are staple foods eaten all over Nigeria.
    I appeal to the humane peoples of the world to support Bankole Laotan Farms with their financial contributions, to invest in COMMERCIAL/ MECHANIZED Farming and grow food crops, to increase supplies and reduce the shortage-induced high prices of foods in Nigeria. Bankole Laotan Farms needs $US 32,000 to  realize this project.

<h2>About me...</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Maria Rotella and I am the owner and operator of Maria Eliana’s Cakes!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563244407/qvu7brke1o4jpsdjyrxj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’ve been making custom cakes and desserts for families and loved ones in Syracuse for over 10 years. Thanks to my many repeat customers I’ve been able to build up my portfolio, make new connections and have flexible time to spend with my two kids. I have always been known as a worker.  From retail to waitressing, working for big corporations to small businesses I’ve truly done it all. My passion has always been desserts and the food industry. I studied and received a degree in Baking and Pastry Arts. After many long years of practicing and perfecting my skills and learning from others, I am finally able to take the leap and open a storefront. I want my space to be welcoming and inviting for all who come in to grab a quick bite with friends or family. </p>
<p>I have grown up here in Syracuse NY. I have loved to bake since I was eight. As elementary school kids, my friends and I would go to College For Kids at O.C.C and each pick a class we wanted to take, from book writing to tie-dyeing classes we tried it all. I remember one friend picked a baking class and that’s when it began for me. We learned how to do the basic frosting of cupcakes, how to make cookies and some of the science of baking. That was it, I was in love.  After camp was over, I would lock my entire family out of our kitchen to bake and make a floury mess of my mother's very tidy kitchen.  When my mother had enough of that, she would send me to my aunt's house down the street where together we would bake new creations while keeping to our roots of boxed brownies and ‘Trading Spaces’ Wednesdays. We would sit on her porch tasting our creations and talk about the future. I knew I wanted to make desserts for a living, I would tell her I wanted to move to the most glamorous place I knew of at the time, NYC, and never get married or have children and open in a bakery. I told her when I made it big she would have to come to visit me and paint a picture on my wall. Well I never made it to NYC, and I have two amazing kids who are my world. My amazing rock, my helper, and biggest fan my Aunt Missy has been gone for 3 years and I’m not sure I’ll ever be the same. I want to make her proud of me and I want to finally get out there and stop working 3 jobs at a time and do what I really love. </p>
<h2>
<u>2018 My Year of Change</u> </h2>
<p>I met and fell hard for my partner one very unexpected day. She has opened my eyes to a whole world of acceptance love and understanding but most importantly <strong>sustainability</strong>. My Nessie is very much an environmentalist who has taught me so much about how to help save our planet more than I knew. I have followed in her footsteps to try to be as zero waste as I can be. I strive to not use single-use plastic products such as cups, straws, forks, spoons, knives and plates. We shop at the farmers market instead of the store where we can pick our produce and not wrapped in plastic. I honestly never realized how much plastic I use on a day to day basis and I knew it was bad, but never understood to the degree how serious the issue is in regards to our planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the biggest goal for my business is to be as eco- friendly and as plastic free as possible.  I want to mainly recycle and compost any waste over throwing things into the trash that will end up in a landfill. I also want to give back to the town I love by donating leftover food to the many people in our community who go without food. Cafe Pastel will be  a safe space for anyone who may need it. I want to make a positive change to Syracuse in any way that I can. </p>
<p>I am looking into Indiegogo as a way to offset the already growing expense. I hope to have things up and running by October 2019. With a location that is perfect for me and construction already underway the expenses of opening a coffee shop are a lot more than I thought!</p>
<h2>
<u>My Vision</u> </h2>
<p>My hope for Cafe Pastel is to be a welcoming and safe environment for all individuals. I have spent time on my menu and I am looking forward to working with vendors around Syracuse to provide you the best options to start your day. I have a few vendors in mind but am waiting to announce them all so you definitely want to stay tuned!  I want to use all my time and energy on the desserts side of the business so using trusted Syracuse favorites for breakfast allows me to do that! I already use the freshest ingredients in my baking and that won't be changing. </p>
<p>I really want to be more involved with is our local community. One way I hope to contribute will be by donating my leftover food. There are several places in our town to drop off food to those who may need it most. Hunger in our area is a huge issue that needs to be resolved. While it may not be resolved this week or next I want to help. </p>
<p>I will be going plastic free. What good is getting rid of the straws if we still have the plastic cups, cutlery and containers? I will be using alternative products that are better for our earth. Bamboo cutlery, to-go cardboard boxes instead of plastic, and paper bags. </p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><u>What we need: </u></h2> <p> <u><strong>New Oven</strong></u> $4,200- Now that I’m in a bigger space I need a bigger oven! A convection oven is more efficient than a regular home oven. Things cook faster so they don’t have to be in the oven as long. They also heat more evenly than a regular oven so there are no “hot spots” </p> <p><u><strong>Espresso Machine</strong></u> $8,000  - Did you know that espresso machines can cost anywhere from $7000 - 20,000, I definitely didn't when I decided to expand my bakery idea to a cafe. I’m really happy to have met and befriend Maria Metthe of Salt City Coffee. She has helped me get together the costs of the coffee side of this business. I am going into this smart and getting a really awesome machine without breaking the bank. This price doesn’t include the cost of a grinder, brewer, decaf equipment, nitro equipment, pour over, kettles for hot water, honestly it goes on. Thanks girl for opening my eyes to the coffee world and steering me in the right direction. </p> <p><strong><u>Commercial Mixer</u></strong> $1,700 - For the past 10 years my 5-quart little red mixer has been a champ. I’ve used it for everything! With a growing business I need something much bigger. For example; making one small tiered cake to feed 30 people from start to finish required me to make batter 2 times. It required me to make frosting anywhere from 3 or 4 times. That’s 6 times starting over from scratch (kinda like this indiegogo campaign) to get a final product. Not only was it a long process but it hasn't been the best use of my time and energy. A commercial mixer will allow me to get everything done faster and more efficiently.</p> <p><strong><u>Custom Wooden Bar</u></strong> $2,300 - Craig Donnelly is a rock star. (Definitely look up his work on IG- @donnellydesigns315) I will be working with him to make a wooden bar for patrons to sit at and hang out. I love to support all the local talent that Syracuse has to offer. I am really happy I got to know him and his family through the “fruit lady” as my children referred to her I can’t wait to see what he has in store for the cafe. </p> <p><strong><u>Furniture</u></strong> $3,700 - Along with many soon to be patrons donating tables and chairs to re-purpose we need some basic staple furniture for out guests. We have been looking all over the Greater Syracuse area for tables and chairs to flip and reuse. This really helps our budget immensely. </p> <p><strong><u>Grease Trap</u></strong> $1,500 - Gross I know. In brief, this little plumbing device helps trap most greases and solids before they enter the waste water disposal system. We’ve spent many years and a LOT of money to clean up Onondaga Lake. Now the county doesn’t mess around with business that could potentially ruin that hard work, and I get it. I am really fortunate that I am not a full fledged restaurant and don’t need a huge box that can cost up to $9,000. But with cooking breakfast sandwiches *cough cough dat bacon* I need a small one to keep our environment free of the gross grease and crap. </p> <p>If by any chance I happen to go over my proposed capital I would not only be so grateful, thankful, blessed, shocked, happy, on cloud 9 I would also be able to take my dream a bit farther. I would use the money wisely. I have so many big ticket items I need to purchase to get this dream started. I would love to get a storefront sign you can see from the highway to get more people to see I am here. I would get more of the equipment I need to get started like freezers, and a fridge.

<h2><u>The Impact</u></h2> <p>This project is really important to me. Not only on a “Hey look mom I made it” level but for the environment contribution I hope to make.

I have been actively working on this dream since April and I have my location secure. I will be opening in Township 5 with an opening date tentatively for the middle of October. Not only is this a prime location for what I want but I know what it’s like to work there. I love knowing I'll be 10 steps away from friends who have been supportive from the get-go. From the Movie Tavern where people can stop in for dessert or before a date. From apartments and Medical offices where people may need a pick me up in the afternoon. All these things make me confident in my decision that this is a perfect location. The only setbacks I am nervous about is the time it takes to build out. I don’t want to miss out on every bakers busy season. The Holidays. I really hope to stick to this timeline and open in the fall. </p>

</div></div>","About me...
Hello! My name is Maria Rotella and I am the owner and operator of Maria Eliana’s Cakes!

I’ve been making custom cakes and desserts for families and loved ones in Syracuse for over 10 years. Thanks to my many repeat customers I’ve been able to build up my portfolio, make new connections and have flexible time to spend with my two kids. I have always been known as a worker.  From retail to waitressing, working for big corporations to small businesses I’ve truly done it all. My passion has always been desserts and the food industry. I studied and received a degree in Baking and Pastry Arts. After many long years of practicing and perfecting my skills and learning from others, I am finally able to take the leap and open a storefront. I want my space to be welcoming and inviting for all who come in to grab a quick bite with friends or family. 
I have grown up here in Syracuse NY. I have loved to bake since I was eight. As elementary school kids, my friends and I would go to College For Kids at O.C.C and each pick a class we wanted to take, from book writing to tie-dyeing classes we tried it all. I remember one friend picked a baking class and that’s when it began for me. We learned how to do the basic frosting of cupcakes, how to make cookies and some of the science of baking. That was it, I was in love.  After camp was over, I would lock my entire family out of our kitchen to bake and make a floury mess of my mother's very tidy kitchen.  When my mother had enough of that, she would send me to my aunt's house down the street where together we would bake new creations while keeping to our roots of boxed brownies and ‘Trading Spaces’ Wednesdays. We would sit on her porch tasting our creations and talk about the future. I knew I wanted to make desserts for a living, I would tell her I wanted to move to the most glamorous place I knew of at the time, NYC, and never get married or have children and open in a bakery. I told her when I made it big she would have to come to visit me and paint a picture on my wall. Well I never made it to NYC, and I have two amazing kids who are my world. My amazing rock, my helper, and biggest fan my Aunt Missy has been gone for 3 years and I’m not sure I’ll ever be the same. I want to make her proud of me and I want to finally get out there and stop working 3 jobs at a time and do what I really love. 

2018 My Year of Change 
I met and fell hard for my partner one very unexpected day. She has opened my eyes to a whole world of acceptance love and understanding but most importantly sustainability. My Nessie is very much an environmentalist who has taught me so much about how to help save our planet more than I knew. I have followed in her footsteps to try to be as zero waste as I can be. I strive to not use single-use plastic products such as cups, straws, forks, spoons, knives and plates. We shop at the farmers market instead of the store where we can pick our produce and not wrapped in plastic. I honestly never realized how much plastic I use on a day to day basis and I knew it was bad, but never understood to the degree how serious the issue is in regards to our planet.
 
One of the biggest goal for my business is to be as eco- friendly and as plastic free as possible.  I want to mainly recycle and compost any waste over throwing things into the trash that will end up in a landfill. I also want to give back to the town I love by donating leftover food to the many people in our community who go without food. Cafe Pastel will be  a safe space for anyone who may need it. I want to make a positive change to Syracuse in any way that I can. 
I am looking into Indiegogo as a way to offset the already growing expense. I hope to have things up and running by October 2019. With a location that is perfect for me and construction already underway the expenses of opening a coffee shop are a lot more than I thought!

My Vision 
My hope for Cafe Pastel is to be a welcoming and safe environment for all individuals. I have spent time on my menu and I am looking forward to working with vendors around Syracuse to provide you the best options to start your day. I have a few vendors in mind but am waiting to announce them all so you definitely want to stay tuned!  I want to use all my time and energy on the desserts side of the business so using trusted Syracuse favorites for breakfast allows me to do that! I already use the freshest ingredients in my baking and that won't be changing. 
I really want to be more involved with is our local community. One way I hope to contribute will be by donating my leftover food. There are several places in our town to drop off food to those who may need it most. Hunger in our area is a huge issue that needs to be resolved. While it may not be resolved this week or next I want to help. 
I will be going plastic free. What good is getting rid of the straws if we still have the plastic cups, cutlery and containers? I will be using alternative products that are better for our earth. Bamboo cutlery, to-go cardboard boxes instead of plastic, and paper bags. 
 
 


 
What we need:   New Oven $4,200- Now that I’m in a bigger space I need a bigger oven! A convection oven is more efficient than a regular home oven. Things cook faster so they don’t have to be in the oven as long. They also heat more evenly than a regular oven so there are no “hot spots”  Espresso Machine $8,000  - Did you know that espresso machines can cost anywhere from $7000 - 20,000, I definitely didn't when I decided to expand my bakery idea to a cafe. I’m really happy to have met and befriend Maria Metthe of Salt City Coffee. She has helped me get together the costs of the coffee side of this business. I am going into this smart and getting a really awesome machine without breaking the bank. This price doesn’t include the cost of a grinder, brewer, decaf equipment, nitro equipment, pour over, kettles for hot water, honestly it goes on. Thanks girl for opening my eyes to the coffee world and steering me in the right direction.  Commercial Mixer $1,700 - For the past 10 years my 5-quart little red mixer has been a champ. I’ve used it for everything! With a growing business I need something much bigger. For example; making one small tiered cake to feed 30 people from start to finish required me to make batter 2 times. It required me to make frosting anywhere from 3 or 4 times. That’s 6 times starting over from scratch (kinda like this indiegogo campaign) to get a final product. Not only was it a long process but it hasn't been the best use of my time and energy. A commercial mixer will allow me to get everything done faster and more efficiently. Custom Wooden Bar $2,300 - Craig Donnelly is a rock star. (Definitely look up his work on IG- @donnellydesigns315) I will be working with him to make a wooden bar for patrons to sit at and hang out. I love to support all the local talent that Syracuse has to offer. I am really happy I got to know him and his family through the “fruit lady” as my children referred to her I can’t wait to see what he has in store for the cafe.  Furniture $3,700 - Along with many soon to be patrons donating tables and chairs to re-purpose we need some basic staple furniture for out guests. We have been looking all over the Greater Syracuse area for tables and chairs to flip and reuse. This really helps our budget immensely.  Grease Trap $1,500 - Gross I know. In brief, this little plumbing device helps trap most greases and solids before they enter the waste water disposal system. We’ve spent many years and a LOT of money to clean up Onondaga Lake. Now the county doesn’t mess around with business that could potentially ruin that hard work, and I get it. I am really fortunate that I am not a full fledged restaurant and don’t need a huge box that can cost up to $9,000. But with cooking breakfast sandwiches *cough cough dat bacon* I need a small one to keep our environment free of the gross grease and crap.  If by any chance I happen to go over my proposed capital I would not only be so grateful, thankful, blessed, shocked, happy, on cloud 9 I would also be able to take my dream a bit farther. I would use the money wisely. I have so many big ticket items I need to purchase to get this dream started. I would love to get a storefront sign you can see from the highway to get more people to see I am here. I would get more of the equipment I need to get started like freezers, and a fridge. It would help me start to pay off the hefty loan I am taking to start my dream. Any monetary contributions 100% go to all the things I need to getting this going!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Beyla Meadery was born out of dreams and a love of creating. We make traditional, historically-inspired and unique mead and ciders that are influenced by past traditions, the seasons and from our own imaginations. </p>
<p>William the mead maker started making mead around 23 years ago. The only mead available at that time was a very sweet mead you got at Renaissance festivals. William worked at a craft brewery and had been a home brewer for sometime. With his vast knowledge and skill special mead and ciders were born.</p>
<p>These delicious creations were well-loved by friends and family. Down the road contests were entered and awards were won.</p>
<p>We create great meads and ciders using fresh local ingredients like quality honey and organic apples. This is the foundation that we build on. Unique mead and ciders are born by adding different spices, fruits, and botanicals. Special varieties of honey are used as well and are expressed in wonderful flavors. All of these come together in an orchestration to create a special product that clearly reflects our love for mead and cider.</p>

<p>Ivan Chai naturally carries 16 amino acids and a significant amount of macronutrients such as potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphorus. It is rich in vitamins B and C.</p>
<p>Ivan Chai is celebrated for its anti-inflammatory properties, so it is recommended for people with gastritis, colitis, gastric ulcers, and flatulence.</p>
<p>The bioflavonoids in Ivan Chai increase activity of antioxidant enzymes in the small intestines, liver, lungs, and the small bowel, which makes Ivan Chai an effective natural detoxifier. A concentrated brew of Ivan Chai remedies food or alcohol poisoning. </p>

<p>Because Ivan Chai contains the oenothein B, it was shown to have healing effects on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP) and prostatic cancer when used as a complementary supplement.</p>

<p>Oz'NBones has brought bangin' southern barbecue up north to Colchester, CT. Run by Chris &amp; Diane Ozmun. We specialize in authentic and artisan barbecue. Everything is made from scratch using only the finest ingredients including  our barbecue sauces and our own award winning dry rub.  We think it's too good not to share - in fact,  our barbecue rub placed second in the National Barbecue News ""Rubs of Honor"" competition in the Fall of 2017.   Oz'NBones BBQ was voted 2nd Runner Up in Hartford Magazine's ""BEST OF"" Awards in Spring of 2019 and 2nd Place in the CTNOW ""Best of Awards"" in June. An amazing feat considering Oz'NBones Food Truck was only established last year. </p>
<p>Our  own homemade barbecue sauces are no joke, either. We've got our  original sauce, a sweet and tangy Kansas City style sauce. Then there's  our sweet Maple Bourbon, made with superior bourbon and organic Grade A  robust maple syrup from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont.  Finally, our  spicy Chipotle Sriracha infused with chipotle peppers and original  sriracha sauce has got a little kick and a lot of flavor.  Because  they're unlike any other sauces out there, we've been told countless  times we need to spread the love -  that's why we're going to have our  rub and sauces commercially bottled and sold at local stores so that  people can enjoy them at home. It's no small task - bottling and  ingredients have to be of the highest quality and making the first run  happen takes a lot of bacon, so-to-speak.</p>
<p>OzNBones  isn't just something we do for fun (although we'll admit that's a big  part of it) - we're serious about our barbecue.  That's why you'll find  our food truck located at the corner of Broadway and Clark Lane in  Colchester serving up our tasty meats and sides, when we aren't catering  or providing food truck service at private events. </p>
<p>The  demand for Oz'NBones has been nothing short of amazing - we've been in  business since April 2017 and have been smoking' the whole time.  Business has  grown out of Chris’ passion for cooking and especially for cooking  authentic southern BBQ. We fell in love with BBQ when visiting Chris’  older brother while he was stationed in the Army in Tennessee over 20  years ago. Chris learned the craft of smoking and barbecue, and has been  perfecting his recipes since then.  All of our recipes are his own  original creations, and everything is made from scratch using fresh  ingredients.  Some say he's a bit obsessed; we won't argue with that.</p>
<p>Chris  spent his high school, college and grad school years working in  restaurants and in the food industry. He started as a bus boy then  worked as a waiter, bartender, and a cook/chef.  He took a brief haitus  from the culinary world to have a successful career in school  administration, but once he got that out of his system it was back to  the barbecue.</p>
<p>Oz'NBones  caters for graduation parties, birthday parties, rehearsal dinners,  weddings, and many other events. We provide our food truck at several  different food festivals, concerts, microbreweries, and much more.  With  your help, we'll continue to grow and expand, and share our home-grown flavors with more barbecue enthusiasts like you.  </p>

<h2><strong>Capital Chicken and Waffles is Expanding</strong></h2>
<p>Capital Chicken and Waffles is the area’s premier chicken and waffles food truck and we have been serving the nation’s capital since January 2013 The truck brings the classic combo of chicken and waffles, to a city that was desperate for a taste of the South.</p>
<p>We also cater for many events such as weddings, parties, private functions and many more. We have since grown to work many big events in and around Washington, DC.</p>
<p>We are family owned and operated and have been featured on Fox5, NFL Network and in Black Enterprise.</p>

Capital Chicken and Waffles is the area’s premier chicken and waffles food truck and we have been serving the nation’s capital since January 2013 The truck brings the classic combo of chicken and waffles, to a city that was desperate for a taste of the South.
We also cater for many events such as weddings, parties, private functions and many more. We have since grown to work many big events in and around Washington, DC.
We are family owned and operated and have been featured on Fox5, NFL Network and in Black Enterprise.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Offbeat Brewery is run by me, Michelle Shipman - head brewer, sales, marketing, deliveries, bar person, the works!  It was established here in Crewe in 2010 and changes were made to the site in 2016 incorporating a bar with the brewery kit alongside rather than in a separate business unit.  I've been brewing for 11 years, previously at the Failford Inn, Ayrshire, and have a wall of certificates and awards to my name.  I'm passionate about beer, brewing and the community that I love being a part of.</p>
<p>It sounds dramatic but saving the drainage will save the brewery.  </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The total repair bill is looking at around £7000 of which I've got about £2000 so far and some of the local bands that play in the bar are looking at a fundraising acoustic music event on 7th October to help us out.  We're hoping to meet the shortfall here through crowd funding on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Everyone who makes a contribution to Offbeat Brewery will get recognition on the website  as well as my undying gratitude. You will get first dibs on special events and opportunities at the brewery. You will have access to  a special, limited edition 'thank you' brew that nobody else will be able to get their hands on - it'll probably have a snazzier name by the time its brewed!</p>
<p>For larger contributions, there are T-shirts, beer subscriptions, brewing experiences, parties - and beer. See the list on the column on the right for details.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Offbeat has built up a great following in Crewe and a small place in the brewing community, I love being involved in events round the town, my heart belongs here, I can't imagine doing anything else.  We're giving you a chance to be a part of this, to support the brewery and see it continue.  Are you one of the hundreds of people who visit #FirstyFriday and love the bands, beers and some how having a great night drinking in a car park?  Don't lose it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've always been really open about things at Offbeat Brewery, it's a bit of a roller coaster at times but I'm determined to pull through this, get through the scary bits for the highs, thrills and good times again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know financial donations aren't always possible, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help by getting the word out about this fundraising campaign. Please share the link to this page with friends or anyone you think might want to contribute - every little bit counts, even if all you do is read or leave a comment. </p>

Soon, we are planning to use the remaining Spirulina to make more products. <strong>They will have an extra income</strong> and you will have a product that comes from a Rural Spirulina Farm. We are planning to give training and also a harvesting system with one of the items of the rewards. Below you can find a video of how they grow Spirulina!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h3>
<p>As all the good stories, this also starts at the basement, in this case, in a laboratory located in the basement of a Research Institute, back in 2010. When Gibrán was studying  the <strong>production of natural compounds</strong> during his Ph.D. program at Tec de Monterrey, he recognized the potential of microalgae as natural source of antioxidants, omegas and proteins. At the same time, Sara was studying her MSc. at Tec de Monterrey and both decided to join their knowledge. They both have been at Arizona State University (USA), Wageningen University (The Netherlands), and in Leuven University (Belgium). In total, <strong>more than 3.5 years</strong> in the most prestigous universitites on this field.</p>

Our Healthy Family
Since we really care about your health and we want to make a huge impact on the way we take care of your health, we are working together with Dietitians, Healthcoaches, Chefs, Health Influencers, Juice Bars, Natural shops, Food companies and Cosmetic companies. Step by step, our products will be accompanied by the expertise of these Health Leaders to make a big change in our nutrition. You can have a glance at them below!

Our Collaborations
We work with national and international universities and research centers to develop our products, but also with different companies and with our government!

 
Our Social Cause
It is very important for us to generate a huge impact in Mexico, not only by improving your Health, but also by supporting people with needs. In this sense, we are planning a collaboration with Rural Spirulina Farmers in San Luis Potosi. The institution in charge of this project is Desarrollo Rural de San Luis Pototsí A.C. They are growing Spirulina to enrich their food and to enrich their nutrition. Soon, we are planning to use the remaining Spirulina to make more products. They will have an extra income and you will have a product that comes from a Rural Spirulina Farm. We are planning to give training and also a harvesting system with one of the items of the rewards. Below you can find a video of how they grow Spirulina!
 

Use of Funding
We will use the money we collect for different purposes. Of course we will produce your reward, that comes first. In second place, we will buy some equipment we need to increase the production capacity we have now. Thirdly, we will make an awsome marketing strategy to change the way we see Health. And finally, we will buy some supplies for our facilities for the production of these superfoods!

 
Our Story
As all the good stories, this also starts at the basement, in this case, in a laboratory located in the basement of a Research Institute, back in 2010. When Gibrán was studying  the production of natural compounds during his Ph.D. program at Tec de Monterrey, he recognized the potential of microalgae as natural source of antioxidants, omegas and proteins. At the same time, Sara was studying her MSc. at Tec de Monterrey and both decided to join their knowledge. They both have been at Arizona State University (USA), Wageningen University (The Netherlands), and in Leuven University (Belgium). In total, more than 3.5 years in the most prestigous universitites on this field.


Our Awards
During this time, our Innovation & Technology has been recognized by 5 different Awards: Genera Monterrey 2011 (by Pase Usted), Hacerlo Mejor 2011 (by CIDAC), Sustainability Innovation Student Challenge Award 2013 (by The Dow Chemical Company), Green Business Award 2013 (by Sustainability Global Institute), and Top 15 Most Innovative Companies (by The Pitch).

<p>In head brewer Bill Bartman, software engineer Joel Bartman, and construction managers Aaron and Brian Franks, we have a quartet of highly skilled professionals whose areas of expertise cover all the key areas for this project.</p>
<p>With these skilled individuals and many friends, we’ve begun the remodel of a beautiful 100+ year-old building — the Lebanon Gem Theater — which has a fascinating history: a storied past dating back to before 1910 when it was host to live vaudeville entertainment and silent movies. We’d like to return the “Gem” to its original grandeur.  Up front, we have the pub and kitchen. In the middle is the perfect small-batch brewing area. And the back third is what time has left of the theater: seating with a stage for karaoke, live music and entertainment, big screen movies and sports. </p>
<p>But to realize this grand adventure, we need your help! Here’s how to be a Founder/Sponsor and get some sweet perks. Check these out. You may choose one or mix and match.</p>
<p><strong> $10/year – Brewality</strong> (For a heightened sense of beer-reality.) Beer has a quality of wonderfulness — a summation of artistic and technical brilliance in liquid form. Help us realize this great adventure of making awesome beer, hearty food, and returning the Gem Theater to its glory. You’ll receive pride in helping launch Barsideous, a Barsideous sticker and a THANK YOU on all our social media platforms. We appreciate all the help we can get, and will show that by giving you a custom vinyl decal. Put it on your car, on your refrigerator, or anywhere else you want to proclaim your support of local craft beer! Not only will we be grateful, but the next time we brew, we will say something like, ""Hey! Remember when [your name here] threw us a few bucks to help get this started? That was rad!"" And we’ll give you a high-five (also available in firm handshake and fist bump).</p>
<p> <strong>$25/year – The Pride and the Passion</strong> (Craft beer is wonderful, mystical, complex and creative.) The Pride and the Passion is a 1957 film starring Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra and Sophia Loren. At Barsideous we craft beer with passion, create food with pride. Show your pride and passion for craft beer and food by wearing your First Edition Barsideous T-shirt. You’ll receive that T-shirt plus all the Brewality swag. Wear your shirt with pride, knowing that you're helping bring great beer to an amazing local market! And it’s so comfy, too!</p>
<p><strong> $50/year — King Gambrinus Birthday Club</strong>  (April 11 is this renowned beer drinker’s birthday. Let’s celebrate!) You receive one free pint of your choice every month on the date of your birthday plus happy-hour-priced pints all day on April 11. Oh, and a Barsideous sticker.</p>
<p><strong>$100/year — The Ben Franklin </strong>(“Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy.” — Benjamin Franklin) And so do we, so don’t worry, be happy. Let us treat you to happy hour pints all day long, one day a week every week. And receive a set of genuine Barsideous pint glasses that give you two 16-ounce glasses of classy drinking pleasure. These glasses are versatile and can stand up to Imperial Stouts and Double IPAs without blinking. You will be the coolest looking guy or gal at the party sipping delicious beverages in these beautiful glasses! Includes the Pride and Passion and Brewality swag.</p>
<p><strong>$200/year – The W.C. Fields</strong> (“Everybody has to believe in something...I believe I'll have another drink.” — W.C. Fields) We believe in teasing the palate and pleasing the purse. Have another on us. You’ll receive a genuine Barsideous pint glass that lives at the brewpub and is magically filled once a week, plus the Barsideous First Edition T-shirt and sticker. Your pint awaits…</p>
<p><strong>$275/year — The Bridge</strong>  - (A love of craft beer and food, a sense of fellowship, and a belief in community.) Join the Barsideous Family bridging connections to our community. Because we belong to a world community, it’s a part of the Barsideous mission to bridge connections with our community through service and donations. With this sponsorship, we donate a portion to a local charity. Help us help our community. Receive the Barsideous gift pack of a growler — first fill on us — and 2 Barsideous pint glasses, 2 First Edition T-shirts, once-a-week 20% discounted growler fills and $1 off pints, plus King Gambrinus Birthday Club membership. In addition, for every regular growler fill, $2 will be donated to charity and $1 for every regular pint.</p>
<p><strong>$300/year – The Bogart </strong>(“The problem with the world is that everyone is a few drinks behind.” — Humphrey Bogart) Time to catch up. What better way than with happy hour prices all day, every day, and all the W.C. Fields swag – all of it.</p>
<p><strong>$350/year – The Barsideous Beer EvangAlelist </strong>(Saving souls one pint at a time.) Invite a friend to enjoy a delicious pint of craft beer with you. You’ll receive a set of the W.C. Fields swag for you and a set for your friend. Twice as much fun! T-shirts can be all the same or any of the different designs —you choose.</p>
<p><strong>$375/year – The Saint Arnold Patron</strong> (Patron Saint of hop pickers and Belgian brewers.) Gotta love those Belgian beers and hop pickers. You get all of The Bridge, and 20% off all additional growler fills, merchandise purchased and all ticketed events in the theater.</p>
<p><strong>$450/year — The Barsideous Fellowship</strong> (Truly an amazing, serendipitous beer-wonderful world.) The range of qualities that beer displays is truly dazzling. That’s one of the things that makes our relationship to beer so compelling — no matter how schooled we become, there is always more to discover. And so, as a Fellowship sponsor, you’ll discover and receive all of the St. Arnold swag, PLUS, we all know “Winter is Coming.” Never fear, we’ve got you and Jon Snow covered! Whether braving the elements in Winterfell or the Willamette Valley, you and a friend will stay warm and toasty in your soft and comfy Barsideous zip-up hoodie sweatshirts. Cool people like yourself need a way to keep warm. Perfect for outdoor beer festivals, camping, and long walks on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>$650/year – The Dude</strong> (“Buy a man a beer and he’ll waste an hour. Teach a man to brew and he’ll waste a lifetime.”) Be the Dude. The ultimate brewery experience! You and a friend will join us in the brewery to help design a recipe, brew the beer, name it, take it through our in-house and Founder's Club tasting panels and follow it through introduction into our tasting room! We will even host you and 10 friends in a private tasting party before we put the beer on tap, and if the beer is as cool as you are for backing us, we will scale it up and give you all the well-deserved credit. Plus 2 Limited Edition hoodie sweatshirts, 2 Barsideous gift packs (includes our pint glass and one growler), and 2  quarter kegs brewed by you for that special event – wedding, New Year’s party, etc. We can't wait to work with you!</p>
<p><strong>$750/year – Barsideous Founders Club -</strong> (“Pizza alone won’t fill the emptiness of your soul …. You’ll also need beer.”) What a wonderful show of support! This short list of 15 distinguished people will receive EXCLUSIVE 1-year membership into our Mug Club.

At the end of the year, you get to take your mug home! Membership definitely has its privileges.</p>
<p><strong>BUT WAIT! - Have a Seat </strong>— literally! With this additional perk, you sponsor one of our barstools. The seat will have a plaque reading, “generously donated by [your name here].” Come in and enjoy a pint on your personalized seat!    </p>
<p><strong>$1,000/year – The Siduri Romance</strong> (Siduri — the Babylonian Goddess of Beer.) Beer has a language all her own, and she gives up her secrets only if you approach her the right way. Treat her with respect and gaze deeply into her amber, bubbling depths; if you listen very carefully, she will speak volumes to you. So we offer you the ultimate romance package. We have four beautiful 3-barrel fermentors. According to federal licensing, they need names. For breweries, fermentors are somewhere between children and sports cars, so names are a crucial part of making amazing beer in them. Like naming a comet after that “special someone” or marking a special date, you'll get to pick a name (with minimal restrictions) and we will engrave it into your tank. ""Larry, Moe Curley,"" ""R2-D2, C-3PO,"" “Lucyale."" Get creative!!! Every day when we walk through the brewhouse and see your tank, we will think of you and give thanks for your generosity! And so will the thousands of people a year who’ll see it! … PLUS you’ll get The Backstage Pass: You and your sweetie and up to 4 other couples of your choice (or 10 folks) will enjoy a private tour of our facility with our head brewer, a dinner for 10 afterward and a special commemorative Barsideous pint glass and T-shirt for each guest. You and your special someone then receive 20% off all ticketed theater events plus happy hour beer and food prices for those events.</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Startup breweries are labor and capital intensive, and our plan is to avoid any commercial debt. We’ve done our due diligence researching every possible roadblock we can think of but, as with any new business, unforeseen expenses and delays could be a challenge. October 2017 is our tentative opening and we’re working towards that goal in every spare moment. Lots of great people are behind us — and we hope to include you in that merry band! We pledge to keep all our Founders informed of our progress. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>CSB - Community Supported Brewing</strong> (CSB) is like Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). We need you to support your local micro — as beer customers we need to make our choices carefully. We can surrender our dough to some vast industrial conglomerate, or we can help support a dedicated brewing entrepreneur who’s a part of our community, who is crazy for good stuff — just like you — and who isn’t trying to water it down to utter blandness. Buying genuine microbrew isn’t just a matter of being nice — it’s self-interest. If we don’t support them, they’ll be gone, and then what will our choices be like?  Consider who you’re giving your money to. Turn your friends on to the pleasures of craft beer — it matters.</p>
<p>Barsideous Brewing is one of a handful of CSBs. We see it as a “bridge brewpub,” bridging connections to you and our Community. A gathering place that draws people in with handcrafted beer and hearty food that invites great conversation with friends. Quality beer is part of a lifestyle that values the experience of living, of making every moment an adventure, every taste worth tasting. </p>
<p>In the same way that CSA was created to help our neighborhood farmers and ranchers fund the hard work of growing our food, your subscription to our CSB helps us brew artisanal, locally-sourced, unique small-batch beers, which in turn helps us support local farmers by buying their hops and barley, fruits, vegetables and meats. </p>
<p>Barsideous Brewing sprang from a passionate desire to save our planet from bland industrialized products, to salvage the authentic flavors of the world’s great beers, and restore the artistry in the making of this beloved beverage. </p>
<p>Farm to table, grain to glass — at Barsideous every beer tells a story about its agricultural roots, its historical context.</p>
<p>At Barsideous our goal is nothing less than keeping beer, a 12,000-year-old cultural treasure of humanity, from slipping into a coma of mechanized industrial anonymity.</p>
<p>At Barsideous we are passionate about the flavor of great beer — brewing up fresh, character-filled beers of all strengths, shades and sensibilities. </p>

<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p>I am Luca<strong> </strong>and <strong>I have a dream</strong>: bring to your home the best wines that Italy has to offer, helping small and medium size wineries to keep the tradition of Italian wine alive.</p>
<p>Among our team of 4 we share a couple of things: passion for wine and for working together.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512951463/amoqdyruyr55zkmhqwvs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We understood how much passion and devotion lie behind wine and we realized that those are the stories that we want to know in order to deeply appreciate what we drink. </p>
<p>To offer rare and high qualities wines we decided to rely on the experts we’ve met – great connoisseurs of wine culture – and to their fantastic knowledge. </p>
<p>We designed Sommelier Wine Box to surprise you with a 3-wines Box per month, selected by a different sommelier each month, according with a special theme. Two Boxes will be available: “Enthusiast” and “Expert”, both with high quality wines, diversified by price. </p>
<p>In order to achieve our goal, we need to create a digital community that engages and promotes the small Italian enterprises that cannot compete in the mass market.</p>
<p><i><strong>Do you want to be part of this dream supporting Sommelier Wine Box?</strong></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512826827/asaozaeq2xfh0iasinvs.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Winemakers</h3>
<p>In Italy there are about 10,000 wine companies and around 1,300 wineries for a 72,300 hectares under vine. Several of those winemakers produce small quantities of excellent wine and dedicate their life since their passion leaves them no alternatives. Their work on the vineyards preserves secrets and traditions kept within wineries for generations and hidden in their wine.</p>
<p>For not being in the mass market many winemakers struggle to survive, with Sommelier Wine Box we want to support them while spreading their stories and unique products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512861108/rdkps1fltnf6lbt2tn6x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What this opportunity involves</h3>

</div></div>","Hey there!
I am Luca and I have a dream: bring to your home the best wines that Italy has to offer, helping small and medium size wineries to keep the tradition of Italian wine alive.
Among our team of 4 we share a couple of things: passion for wine and for working together.

We understood how much passion and devotion lie behind wine and we realized that those are the stories that we want to know in order to deeply appreciate what we drink. 
To offer rare and high qualities wines we decided to rely on the experts we’ve met – great connoisseurs of wine culture – and to their fantastic knowledge. 
We designed Sommelier Wine Box to surprise you with a 3-wines Box per month, selected by a different sommelier each month, according with a special theme. Two Boxes will be available: “Enthusiast” and “Expert”, both with high quality wines, diversified by price. 
In order to achieve our goal, we need to create a digital community that engages and promotes the small Italian enterprises that cannot compete in the mass market.
Do you want to be part of this dream supporting Sommelier Wine Box?


Winemakers
In Italy there are about 10,000 wine companies and around 1,300 wineries for a 72,300 hectares under vine. Several of those winemakers produce small quantities of excellent wine and dedicate their life since their passion leaves them no alternatives. Their work on the vineyards preserves secrets and traditions kept within wineries for generations and hidden in their wine.
For not being in the mass market many winemakers struggle to survive, with Sommelier Wine Box we want to support them while spreading their stories and unique products.


What this opportunity involves
With Sommelier Wine Box you’ll get a 3-wine box per month while entering in direct contact with small and special Italian winemakers, discovering their lives and stories. In those wines you’ll find wine producers’ work and character - a slice of Italy will come to your home, with all fragrances, colors and secrets of the region.
But that’s not all! Buying Sommelier Wine Box you’ll be concretely supporting those small and excellent winemakers, who have wine as a reason to live.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I grew up in Novato and always had a passion for great hospitality and delicious food. I have lived around the country and traveled to different parts of the World, but Novato is where I have wanted to be. Working in the restaurant industry gave me the passion and drive to want to open my own restaurant. Craft &amp; Vintage comes from that passion. I love places that exude warm hospitality and want that in Novato. I love trying new things when it comes to food and libations. I want to offer that to others as well. We want to give you the opportunity to try an awesome craft beer from New England or an amazing wine from Croatia. Our delicious cuisine is going to be farm to table, using locally sourced meats, cheeses, vegetables, etc. We want you to not be limited to one dish while you are out eating. Come out with friends and order 5 things to share. Hang out for an hour before you head to a movie or hang out for four hours with your friends or family laughing and having a great time. That is what Craft &amp; Vintage is all about. Come and Enjoy!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000. When we raise this money, we will be able to finally secure a lease and move forward with construction and opening the doors. </p>
<p>We are offering wonderful perks to all those who contribute to our campaign. They include brand specific swag as well as delicious meals and fun events. </p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal of $10,000, we will using the money towards our lease when we are able to get a business loan to get the remaining amount. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Opening a restaurant is always very risky. Will I get enough money to pay for the overhead costs? Will I find the right people for the right positions? Will everything be completed in time? What if? These are all things that scare me and I question on a daily basis. I have the education and experience to make this passion of mine become a reality and will work through the obstacles that come my way with the support of my friends and family. The money will come. I just know that enough people believe in my project and abilities that it will happen. It may not happen in the time frame that I originally hoped for, but I know it will happen. I also know that I will find the right people to work at Craft &amp; Vintage. I already have a great core started and believe that they have the same vision for the restaurant as I do.

<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>
<p>As you've probably guessed by our name, we serve delicious vegan junk food. Our focus is on taste and recreating classic junk food that's 100% cruelty free.  We have been following a vegan lifestyle for five years now with a passion and enthusiasm but the one thing that we have missed was a decent junk food fix!  We made it our mission to create the perfect vegan fast food and we are convinced that we have done that. <br/>You will never need to worry about cross contamination or being served animal products by mistake as there will not be any in our premises.<br/>We will be offering all our classics from our pop-up menus, along with several new additions which you are going to love!<br/> <br/><strong>What We Have Achieved So Far</strong></p>
<p>We created vegan junk food for ourselves in our own home but the feedback we received from our family and friends suggested to us that there could be a genuine need in the market for a vegan takeaway. We thought a great way to test how well Greazy Vegan would do and to get feedback on what people thought of our food, would be to hold a pop up event. We spoke to the owner of a local Pontcanna pub and they let us take over their kitchen on a Sunday evening. We instantly had a great response to the event, with all 100 places being booked within days. Every pop-up we held after that followed suit, and a couple of events were fully booked within hours of announcing the dates! We had such amazing feedback about our menu, perhaps expectedly from fellow vegans but also from their meat eating friends. These pop ups were more successful than we ever hoped they would be.  Due to demand and people desperate to taste our food, we quickly gained a waiting list of over 800 people!! At this point we decided we needed a permanent home.<br/>Since then, we have featured on many several local, national and international media outlets, with support and interest from around the globe. We have been genuinely surprised and overwhelmed by the best wishes we've received and in particular from people we've never met - we are totally and utterly committed to make Greazy Vegan a success.<br/> <br/><strong>What We Want To Achieve</strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about animals, their welfare and our environment.  We want to create a takeaway restaurant that is simple, inviting and 100% cruelty free.  We want Greazy Vegan to be accessible to people of all ages, and to appeal to vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters. We hope to show people that you don't have to miss out on your favourite junk food when you give up animal products.</p>
<p>Our plan is to open a vegan takeaway in a central Cardiff, UK location as it would be more accessible to potential customers. We aim to create a simple, bright and welcoming restaurant that can appeal to everyone. We believe that our proposed site will benefit from being opposite the castle as tourists will be able to easily find us too.<br/> In due course, we also plan on using Deliveroo delivery service.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>After having to make an ethical choice with our main investor, we are now looking to raise the rest of the funding to complete the work and to open our restaurant as soon as possible. We are passionate about being 100% vegan and aim to be the market leader of veganism in Cardiff; we will not compromise on this vision. We have had to take the difficult decision to part company with our main investor as they were not able to commit to the 100% vegan standards that we aspire to. This was a difficult but ethical decision and as a result we are now looking for crowdfunding to take the next steps in the Greazy vegan journey.<br/>Having invested our own time and funds to date, we now require additional funding to get the business open. The funding would be used for;<br/>⦁ Fit out costs (kitchen equipment fixtures and fittings), decoration<br/>⦁ Costs of initial stock of food, packaging<br/>⦁  Launch costs of branding and some advertising</p>
<p>Finally, if you are unable to donate, we would be very grateful if you could share this with your friends and followers to get the word out there!</p>

We have been genuinely surprised and overwhelmed by the best wishes we've received and in particular from people we've never met - we are totally and utterly committed to make Greazy Vegan a success. What We Want To Achieve
We are passionate about animals, their welfare and our environment.  We want to create a takeaway restaurant that is simple, inviting and 100% cruelty free.  We want Greazy Vegan to be accessible to people of all ages, and to appeal to vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters. We hope to show people that you don't have to miss out on your favourite junk food when you give up animal products.
Our plan is to open a vegan takeaway in a central Cardiff, UK location as it would be more accessible to potential customers. We aim to create a simple, bright and welcoming restaurant that can appeal to everyone. We believe that our proposed site will benefit from being opposite the castle as tourists will be able to easily find us too. In due course, we also plan on using Deliveroo delivery service.
What We Need
After having to make an ethical choice with our main investor, we are now looking to raise the rest of the funding to complete the work and to open our restaurant as soon as possible. We are passionate about being 100% vegan and aim to be the market leader of veganism in Cardiff; we will not compromise on this vision. We have had to take the difficult decision to part company with our main investor as they were not able to commit to the 100% vegan standards that we aspire to. This was a difficult but ethical decision and as a result we are now looking for crowdfunding to take the next steps in the Greazy vegan journey.Having invested our own time and funds to date, we now require additional funding to get the business open. The funding would be used for;⦁ Fit out costs (kitchen equipment fixtures and fittings), decoration⦁ Costs of initial stock of food, packaging⦁  Launch costs of branding and some advertising
Finally, if you are unable to donate, we would be very grateful if you could share this with your friends and followers to get the word out there!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're just a few local boys trying to make good beer for good folks.</p>
<ul>
<li>We at Edgewise Eight pride ourselves on making delicious beer. Over the years we've honed our skills by brewing hundreds of times and competing in some of the nation's largest beer competitions. The feedback we've gotten has allowed us to hone our brews down to something we feel is both delicious and accessible and with over 20 awards under our belts we feel like we're justified in trying to make a product for the people of Weatherford. Our unofficial motto is ""beer is meant to be drank"" and we strive to achieve the highest levels of drinkability in our beer.</li>
<li>We started this campaign as not only a way to raise money but also to foster a community. Beer halls have served as meeting grounds for good times for hundreds of years and we want to bring that experience to Weatherford.</li>
<li>Your contributions will go towards helping fund Weatherford's first brewery in living memory. We're very excited at this prospect and hope you'll help us with this journey.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>While a tasty brew may only set you back a few bucks, the equipment and infrastructure needed to produce it requires substantial funding. All proceeds will be going toward the purchase of a brew system, fermenters, a bar, glassware, ingredients, etc.</li>
<li>We hope that our perks go beyond the normal funding rewards of something like this. We tried to keep everything reasonably priced but still able to help us reach our goals.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our final goals then we do still intend on having a party and giving out beer and merch that was purchased to all those who believed in us enough to contribute.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your donations would help in a tremendous way.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to make our brewpub the most inviting place to go in Weatherford. Contributions will help to make that experience even better buy helping us buy more and better amenities (we'd love to have a beer garden for example).</li>
<li>We'd love to be able to share our beer with the world, but especially with our local community. Your contributions can help make that happen.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The costs of opening a brewery are many. There's always the chance that we won't reach our financial goals. Here's what we're doing to mitigate that risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are actively seeking investors outside of this crowdfunding source to ensure we can get all the funding we need.</li>
<li>We're also speaking with local officials and industry leaders in the area to get tips and advice so we don't fail.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially but would still like to help then we always appreciate recommendations to your friends, loved ones, people you know, or even random strangers you run into every day.</p>
<h3>The Fine Print</h3>
<ul>
<li>While we appreciate everyone's enthusiasm we will not be awarding any rewards containing alcohol vouchers to anyone under the age of 21.</li>
<li>To help keep costs down we are not currently planning on shipping any of the rewards. You're coming in to have a beer anyway, right? We'll send out vouchers that you can redeem whenever you choose to come in. If that's not possible for you then please let us know and we'll see what can be done.</li>
<li>Unfortunately we don't have actual pictures of the rewards yet (we're working on it). Everything shown is at least equivalent/similar to what will be given out though and we'll update the site as we get the actual photos.</li>

<h3>Why Zuzu's is Asking for Your Support</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Tim Smith. Right now and for the last couple of years I have been Zuzu's Bakery. I make interesting, delicious and nutritious bread. There is more demand for it than I am currently able to produce. While customers browse and munch our produce, they also browse our gallery space, pitched to showcase local artists for affordable hanging fees.</p>
<p><br/>Zuzu’s Bakery is the result of my 54 years of real world experiences, named after my late daughter Zuzu. Parenting my very disabled little girl took us through times when I had to decide whether to spend money on healthcare or food. </p>
<p><br/>I was lucky, I had some support and was able to work. So, I only had to make this financial call occasionally. Many people have much less luck. Many people have to live day-to-day with such financial and decisions. This isn’t right.</p>
<p><br/>Zu’ and I had a good, fun, active and happy life. Zuzu’s Bakery is fuelled by the lessons I learned through that beautiful period of parenthood and my relationship with Zu'. Lessons about love, about nutrition, and about not having much money in a world where good, nutritious food costs, are present in every aspect of the business. Zuzu's Bakery works, and we’d like your help to continue.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zuzu's is based in Malton, North Yorkshire, which has a mixed demographic ranging from the very wealthy to the very poor. We want to sell our food to our community and – ‘Bread by Mail’ – beyond it</li>
<li>Zuzu's bakery will use the money that you contribute to continue selling our food  at realistic prices. By this we mean '<strong>realistic for all abilities to pay'</strong>
</li>
<li>How do we do this? We sell our food to people who can afford our high quality produce at a price reflecting the time, skill, and high quality ingredients. This allows us to subsidise the same delicious, nutritious, interesting food for<i> people who can't normally afford it for themselves and their children</i>. </li>
<li>We want to make more, to sell more, to more people</li>
<li>At 54 years old, with a wealth of experience in catering and other spheres of life, I know this approach to making and selling food and nutrition works. It is grounded in reality; Zuzu’s has already proven it is not a pipe dream nor a phase for the business to move through to open more shops and ""make a name"" with. <i><strong>This is the business. This is Zuzu's Bakery's heart and soul</strong></i>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need from You</h3>
<p>All the lovely plans in the world come to dust, however, if some realism in the form of money isn't included. Living with Zu' made me a very hard-visioned realist. So, let's get to where you, your support and your money come in.<br/><br/>Zuzu's is looking to raise up to (or beyond) £25,000. This will enable me to provide good bread to a wide range of pockets – including people who cannot afford nutritious food to feed themselves or their families. We intend to use the money to achieve at least some of this: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Escape the Catch-22 </strong>of needing an additional oven and one more person in order to expand production while at the same time needing to expand production to employ and additional person and oven</li>
<li>
<strong>Employ one more person</strong> (Debra by name - who is already working for the bakery on a voluntary basis) to look after the shop and to organise events such as our ongoing gallery of Art by Women. We charge our artists no hanging fee and only take a small commission on any sales to support Zuzu's Bakery. Debra has been essential in getting Zuzu's to where we are now. We think she deserves more than our love and a loaf a day</li>
<li>
<strong>Cover the next two quarters of rent</strong> so we can purchase good quality ingredients to make good quality bread.<i> That's £7k all on its own</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Buy an additional oven with at least 70 loaf capacity</strong>. This will enable me to make more bread, faster. Kind of essential to providing it to more people. That's in the region of £4k</li>
<li>
<strong>Buy an big sign for the front of the building to attract more customers.</strong> Signage is important, it is also highly regulated by our landlord. We need a good sign that faces out and is supported by smaller hanging signs that face up and down the road. That's around £400 — or - let us know if you fancy making one!</li>
<li>
<strong>Lay down a new bakery floor</strong> and refit the currently derelict staff changing room (<i>a massive 4 foot wide by 8 foot long</i>)</li>
</ul>

<p>At Zuzu's, Debra and I want to make delicious, nutritious and interesting food for people who can afford to pay for quality produce in order for us to pay ourselves and to subsidise those people who can't. Here's how we make this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>We already provide at least one ‘Wonky Bread Day’ per week. We sell two or three day old bread at a heavy discount or even for free to people who want and need it. We like to make this is regular, daily experience</li>
<li>Zuzu's would like to expand to provide ‘Bread by Mail’ so we can use the Internet to expand our reach, our method and our message of ""Bread for All – Zero Waste""</li>
<li>All of the items – and yes, the cash we need to get them – will contribute to these plans</li>

<li>
<strong>Then the bakery floor collapsed</strong>; three of the ovens I bought died and had to be replaced; the gas, electricity supplies required upgrades; so did the extraction - this is now fixed, legally compliant and unexplodey.

<li><p>Then a bunch of family issues involving dementia and cancer (yup... you couldn't write it) meant I had to stop work in order to help with life. Rent still needed paying at the bakery </p></li>
<li><p>All this meant that money ran short</p></li>
<li><p>I kept going. Making and selling bread. And, with the help of good friends, tiling, building, plumbing and more</p></li>
<li><p>Then Debra arrived and made life 100% easier. We sold bread. We made more bread. We sold more bread. Simple but not quite enough. We are making money but we need to make more bread (and money) to see us through to Christmas</p></li>
<li><p>We want to keep going. We’re dedicated. We're working all hours possible while maintaining quality, vision, our integrity and a sense of humour. </p></li>

<h3>We're two dudes who want to share their love of food with everyone.</h3>
<p>We're two guys who love LA and show it through our passion for our food! With a combined experience of over 14 years in the food industry, we're finally ready to expand the Johnny Pacific brand to the greater Los Angeles area! We've worked hard to build good will within our Canoga Park / West San Fernando Valley community and we take pride in serving up our house made fillings and sauces, hand folded empanadas, and refreshing agua refrescos! Our goal has always been to bring the best tasting empanadas to the greater Los Angeles area (and beyond) and by helping fund Johnny Pacific LA, not only will you become a part of a 14 year old pipe dream to expand beyond the San Fernando Valley, but you also will get some exclusive, once in a lifetime kind of perks from a REALLY good empanada spot in Downtown Los Angeles (don't believe us, see what our friends on YELP have to say).</p>
<p>So, how can you be a part of Johnny Pacific's history in the making? We're looking to raise $50,000 ​to complete the build out of our space in Chinatown's newest food hall, POTLUCK! We're going to use this money for build-out and necessary equipment.</p>
<p>We thank you for checking out our page and we look forward to serving you in the future!</p>

</div><p>Thank you very much for sharing your valuable time with KOCHI. </p><p>TASTING IS BELIEVING~!! </p></div>","I am craving for Exotic (but authentic) Korean Chicken sauce, Are YOU? 

Our Co-founder has a passion for food & his unique background (born & raised in S. Korea but living in US for more than half of his life) keeps leading to launch this new sauce that can fulfill both sides of culture  

KOCHI sauce (Korean Chicken) can make Anyone enjoys Tasty Hot & Sweet Korean Style chicken at anytime anywhere.  

If you LIKE Fried Chicken, we will make you to LOVE it !!
 
Why is it good?

Very First & the Only authentic Korean Chicken Sauce. (you wouldn't find anything like this: unless you go to some special Korean chicken restaurants) 

""Convenience doesn't need to sacrifice great taste"".



Here is what we need

We need funds to make this happens! (funds will cover includes, but not limited to)
Minimum Production cost (Perfect recipe is ready by R&D now~)
Packaging & Marketing cost


When we reach out the Goal (funds), we will surely consider for ""Thank you"" expression to those who help us. (could be small/memorable gift, discount, and more)
If we somehow don't reach out to the goal, still the fund will be fully used for production.



Risks & Challenges
Since this is a new sauce, lack of brand-recognition would be the weakness. (Well,  eventually ""Taste speaks louder than any word"", we believe) 

We are working on developing another New Great Sauce for meat & having more SKU will bring some power to be recognized by food-lovers 
Aggressive marketing activities (SNS, media, etc) will be following to promote & present.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is John Thomas.   I have been a teacher for the past 17 years and a competitive BBQ Pit-master since 2014.  In 2018, I moved back to my home state of Montana after 20+ years in Virginia with my wife and family.  We moved home to be closer to my parents and sister.  While in Virginia, my best friend and I competed 2 or 3 times a year in BBQ Competitions.  While we were strictly amateurs, it was fun to go up against the power house BBQ teams such as Jack's Old South, Cool Smoke, and Aporkcalypse Now.  When we got to Montana I decided 1.  I would continue to compete in BBQ Competitions and 2. I wanted to teach my high school students the art of smoking meats competitively. </p>
<p>That first year we did not have a lot of members, but it created a nice foundation for this year.  This year, with more advertising and a lot of BBQ, our numbers have swelled to 15 members.  Every other week - in an attempt to practice for competition BBQ, I make up some BBQ treats for the club and we feast on pulled pork, St Louis Ribs, BBQ Beans and Mac N Cheese, beef short ribs, or whatever I have been practicing on.  We discuss rubs and sauces and regional style of BBQ.  My hope is to have the kids compete against each other in a BBQ competition before the end of the school year.</p>
<p>As a teacher, it became clear that our community has a lot of people in need.   It hit home when I found out one of my wife's students and her family were living at the homeless shelter.  I decided we should help out the community if we can.  I approached our group  about raising food for the shelter.  They decided we should spend a couple weekends this spring (once it warms up a bit) smoking some BBQ for the people in the shelter.  It is the perfect opportunity for them to work on their skills, but also help people in need.</p>
<p>I hope to raise money to pay for the shelter, but also to keep feeding my students in an attempt to teach them various styles of BBQ.   My wife and I are both teachers. We do not make a lot of money, but we enjoy BBQ and love to share it with friends, family and of course my students.  This will continue whether our goal is accomplished or not.</p>
<p>By donating to this cause you will be supporting the education of students in the art of BBQ skills and possibly a future in the food service industry, the teaching of charitable work for those kids and the donation of food to those less fortunate.    I look forward to working with the kids this spring and hope you can be part of this wonderful experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Donations will help pay for the meats, wood and supplies for producing BBQ.  </p>
<p>Feeding my kids BBQ twice a month - showing them different types of BBQ styles costs between $50-75 each time.  </p>
<p>Feeding the homeless will  cost around $125  each time we do it, which should feed about 50 people.  I would like to bring food to the shelter 3 or 4 times during the spring.  More if possible.  </p>
<p>If you choose to help, you can earn various perks for your donations from Bengal BBQ recipes to BBQ Club T-shirts, to BBQ meals.  Hopefully these will inspire you to donate.</p>
<p>Now, if we do not reach our goal - 100% of the donations will still be used to offset costs.  The primary goal for this campaign is to feed the kids and the homeless.  No matter what - I will continue to feed my students BBQ as part of their learning and we will donating to the shelter this spring either way.  You can help pay with your donations and help.  If we reach our goal - all other funds will be used to continue to feed the homeless shelter.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your donation helps feed the homeless in Helena.</li>
<li>Your donation helps teach high school students skills that they can use once they leave school and provide them with valuable work experience, learning teamwork, philanthropy and responsibility.</li>
<li>Please help me teach these kids how to BBQ and help others by doing it.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is really a low risk and high reward campaign.  I will continue to bring food for my students twice a month and introduce them to various BBQ styles.  Before we decided to raise funds, the students and I both agreed that we would buy whatever meats we were cooking for the shelter ourselves.  If we don't raise enough money - we will do it by ourselves.  And I am more than happy to continue cooking for my students - but it would be nice to have some help.</p>

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>I have worked for many years in Restaurants, 5 Star Hotels and catering events in London, Paris, NYC, Vancouver and Toronto. I have been train in silver service, offering Service excellence. </p>
<p>Recently while working an at home dinner for a catering company I saw that the other servers did not know how to approach the client, they were so use to working large events that the 5 star service the client wanted they simply could not do. They were not trained to know how to give great service. I created Festa Fete to focus on training and giving the service needed.</p>
<p>Every hostess/host  would like to enjoy their party, talk with their guests and know that all the little details that matters to them will be done.  And after the event they want to go to bed knowing the next morning they will not be cleaning all day. Our Party Assistants will make it happen. ""We have got you"". </p>
<p>Festa Fete is Party Party in Italian and French. Well trained, 5 star servers able to manage small events in homes and offices.  </p>
<p>Funding will allow Festa Fete vision to expand using the technology of today to drive the growth of the company with the creation of the App.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Festa Fete is currently a word of mouth business, slowly building clientele and training staff to offer</p>
<p>service excellence. We would like to grow and expand and therefore need funding. To do so we have</p>
<p>created the phases we will be following over the next 6 months.</p>
<p>Phase 1 - </p>
<p> Create training manual,  uniform designs, equipment, tool. </p>
<p>Advertising , legal and increase branding          - $50,000</p>
<p>Phase 2-</p>
<p>Creation of the App</p>

<p>Phase 3-</p>
<p>Merchandise online sales                                        - $50,000</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Most good ideas die because there is no funding. Your donation will help our brand become international. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All new businesses will have challenges, finding clients and the right staff. Making sure that legal rights and protections are in place for property, staff and clients. Safety. Not rushing too quickly to accept work,. Finding the right staff and making sure they are trained and ready. Having enough funds and anticipating possible financial set backs..</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell your friends, family, coworkers. All your social media. We are not looking for you to give so much but if a few people give $10 and then tell their friends, social media followers and do so and so on. Suddenly a little idea will become a reality and you will be walking pass a Festa fete server on their way to a party and recognize the logo on their equipment bag and know you helped make it happen!! All it took was $5, $10, $100 and telling others.</p>

<p>Mola Foods prides itself on creating tastes and flavors from around the world. The company uses recipes that have survived from a rich heritage and have been passed down from generation to generation. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>At Last, ready-to-use culture in a bottle</strong></p>
<p>Our vision is to change the food industry and become the kitchen staple in every household with our culture in a bottle. Mola products are made from real natural ingredients without any added preservatives.</p>
<p>Mola Foods produces what we believe to be an iconic line of spices, sauces, and condiments derived from a variety of authentic African recipes. We control the quality of the ingredients that go into our products as well as the mixing and packaging process. This contrasts with our competition who focus on mass-market goals rather than authentic, heritage-based recipes.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: we create a culture in a bottle. This means that with each use of the assorted flavors, customers can feel like they have been transported to a new country. </p>
<p>The company’s end goal is to continue to create new flavors, satisfy each customer’s craving for something packed with flavor and to become an essential item in kitchens all over the world—all the while maintaining an affordable value.</p>

<p>Meet Jeannette Bryant <strong>founder</strong> of Mola Foods, Inc. Cameroonian born. She offers spice blends and chili relishes inspired by exotic locations and exciting cooking styles like Morocco, Ethiopia, India and more. “We hope to create awareness about a revolutionary way of adding spices into cooking and bringing life to dishes,” Bryant said. I started Mola Foods as a way to help people experience the culture and inspire them to use more spices when cooking. We create what I call culture in a bottle by mixing all the spices used by each country in one bottle. In turn, we create flavor profiles that people are able to use and create delicious meals as they get transported to each cultural destination.</p>

Meet Jeannette Bryant founder of Mola Foods, Inc. Cameroonian born. She offers spice blends and chili relishes inspired by exotic locations and exciting cooking styles like Morocco, Ethiopia, India and more. “We hope to create awareness about a revolutionary way of adding spices into cooking and bringing life to dishes,” Bryant said. I started Mola Foods as a way to help people experience the culture and inspire them to use more spices when cooking. We create what I call culture in a bottle by mixing all the spices used by each country in one bottle. In turn, we create flavor profiles that people are able to use and create delicious meals as they get transported to each cultural destination.

<p></p><p></p><p><b>THE BREW HA</b></p>
<p>Banjo Cold Brew Coffee™ is a slow-brewed coffee, hand-crafted by steeping our specialty-grade beans in cold filtered water for nearly 24 hours; thus producing a more flavorful, more caffeinated, and less acidic drink (as compared to auto-drip hot coffee or espresso). All-natural with nothing artificial (see the amazingly short ingredients list). Banjo is awesome straight out of the refrigerated bottle, “on the rocks”, or “fine-tuned” to your liking.  It’s even delicious when heated!</p>
<p>Our delectable cold brew comes in two flavors: Original and Sweetened. Banjo is bottled in 32oz recyclable, amber glass howlers for the fridge with a single serve bottle soon to follow. Launching in Atlanta this Spring; we plan to strategically expand nationwide as we grow!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Technically, a group of goats is called a Tribe. Eloise, Cocoa, Dee, Pearl, Penelope, Bee, Thelma, Ella, Rosey, Tippy, Dorothy, Ellen, Ponyo, Bonni, Tiny, Tink, Eve, Ellie, Brownie, Beyonce, Pepper, Penny, Rizzo, Beauty, Princess, Paprika, and a few yet to be named doelings along with the Hall Family, all live on the beautiful property that is Razzbourne Farms in Rockbridge County. In 2014, Emily Hall founded the micro goat dairy and creamery with her husband, CJ, which allowed her to pursue her passion and stay home with their two children. Did we mention they moved the dairy and creamery to their new property in Kerrs Creek in 2017? A lot of obstacles were met and defeated. Just take a look for yourself:</p>

<p><i>The entire Razzbourne Farms creamery placed on the completed pad by a 19-year-old employee of Helmuth Builders (Halloween 2017).</i></p>
<p>Razzbourne Farms has produced fresh CHEVRE weekly and delivered one day fresh to local retailers and restaurants.  The micro goat dairy and creamery's bloomy rind cheeses, KICK ASH and LUCY ROUGE, can be found in downtown Lexington restaurants and small groceries in the area. Emily, the cheesemaker, found herself experimenting at the new property and the results have concluded with semi-hard cheeses bathed in local Rockbridge Vineyard wine or Halcyon Days cider. She hopes to add a beer washed cheese, a brie type cheese, and goat feta. Each Razzbourne Farms product is hand made and in very small batches. This tribute to the terrior that is Rockbridge County is one of a kind.</p>

<h3>What They Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Space for Affinage</p>
<p>Temperature and humidity play a role but SPACE is the main issue. The many deep freezers have become inadequate for the type of raw milk aged cheese Razzbourne Farms wants to produce. This campaign will help fund the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cheese Cave Building</li>
<li>Excavation &amp; Utilities</li>
<li>Interior<ul>
<li>Locally milled reclaimed Ash shelving best suited for affinage (aging)</li>
<li>Wall and floor resurfacing</li>
<li>Thermostat and humidity control</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equipment &amp; Supplies</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fees &amp; Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>*Any additional funds raised will go toward perimeter fence building because with goats, there is ALWAYS fence to build.</p>
<p>*Razzbourne Farms will still plan on building the cave, it will just take MUCH longer.</p>
<p>*All perks will be received whether the campaign is funded in full or not.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If this campaign is successful Razzbourne Farms will have so much more to offer. Excavation and construction will begin immediately with plans to put the first batch of raw milk cheese in the new cave in March of 2020. If the campaign does not reach the goal, the funds raised will go toward the prefabricated building that will house cheese in the future.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Razzbourne Farms has always sold wholesale to promote local business. With the help of some amazing neighbors, they have been able to have a storefront close to home which will be utilized more in 2020. Private cheese tastings are available at predetermined locations by appointment only. Please JoinTheTribe on social media @razzbournefarms to stay up to date on new adventures!</p>
<p>Some facts for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Razzbourne Farms is the only micro goat dairy and creamery in Rockbridge County.</li>
<li>They produce small but delectable batches of farmstead, artisan cheese.</li>
<li>The protein structure and lower levels of lactose of goat cheese make it a better choice for people with an intolerance to cow's milk.</li>
<li>Razzbourne Farms strives to produce a healthy product that everyone will enjoy. Goat cheese is a low-calorie product at just 75 calories per ounce.</li>
<li>Goat's milk is richer in essential nutrients vitamin A, vitamin B, riboflavin, calcium, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium.</li>
<li>Since they're smaller than cows, they require less space and less food. Goats can also survive in places where other dairy animals literally can't: They're opportunistic foragers who happily munch on a wide variety of plants that other ruminants won't eat, like desert scrub, weeds, trees, shrubs, and aromatic herbs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The emerging micro goat dairy and creamery has never had a sophisticated cheese cave and there are expected obstacles to arise but that has never stopped them before.</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing small, handcrafted batches of cheese does possess a quantity issue but Razzbourne Farms has always chosen quality over quantity.</li>
<li>Razzbourne Farms will take risks with new recipes and creating new products but how awesome is that!?</li>
<li>Affinage is a new concept for the micro goat dairy and creamery since it has only focused on fresh and ripened cheese until now.</li>

Technically, a group of goats is called a Tribe. Eloise, Cocoa, Dee, Pearl, Penelope, Bee, Thelma, Ella, Rosey, Tippy, Dorothy, Ellen, Ponyo, Bonni, Tiny, Tink, Eve, Ellie, Brownie, Beyonce, Pepper, Penny, Rizzo, Beauty, Princess, Paprika, and a few yet to be named doelings along with the Hall Family, all live on the beautiful property that is Razzbourne Farms in Rockbridge County. In 2014, Emily Hall founded the micro goat dairy and creamery with her husband, CJ, which allowed her to pursue her passion and stay home with their two children. Did we mention they moved the dairy and creamery to their new property in Kerrs Creek in 2017? A lot of obstacles were met and defeated. Just take a look for yourself:

Pre Excavation of building pad and moving the building from Fairfield.

Pad excavation complete!

The entire Razzbourne Farms creamery placed on the completed pad by a 19-year-old employee of Helmuth Builders (Halloween 2017).
Razzbourne Farms has produced fresh CHEVRE weekly and delivered one day fresh to local retailers and restaurants.  The micro goat dairy and creamery's bloomy rind cheeses, KICK ASH and LUCY ROUGE, can be found in downtown Lexington restaurants and small groceries in the area. Emily, the cheesemaker, found herself experimenting at the new property and the results have concluded with semi-hard cheeses bathed in local Rockbridge Vineyard wine or Halcyon Days cider. She hopes to add a beer washed cheese, a brie type cheese, and goat feta. Each Razzbourne Farms product is hand made and in very small batches. This tribute to the terrior that is Rockbridge County is one of a kind.

What They Need & What You Get
Space for Affinage
Temperature and humidity play a role but SPACE is the main issue. The many deep freezers have become inadequate for the type of raw milk aged cheese Razzbourne Farms wants to produce. This campaign will help fund the following:

The Cheese Cave Building
Excavation & Utilities
Interior
Locally milled reclaimed Ash shelving best suited for affinage (aging)
Wall and floor resurfacing
Thermostat and humidity control


Equipment & Supplies
Indiegogo Fees & Marketing

*Any additional funds raised will go toward perimeter fence building because with goats, there is ALWAYS fence to build.
*Razzbourne Farms will still plan on building the cave, it will just take MUCH longer.
*All perks will be received whether the campaign is funded in full or not.
 
If this campaign is successful Razzbourne Farms will have so much more to offer. Excavation and construction will begin immediately with plans to put the first batch of raw milk cheese in the new cave in March of 2020. If the campaign does not reach the goal, the funds raised will go toward the prefabricated building that will house cheese in the future.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<ul>
<li>Smokin' Angels Q is a food truck in the making. The name comes from my dad and grandfather who both introduced me to BBQ done by smoking; they are my angels.  I am Dorian Barr, a seasoned Nationally Registered Paramedic, that has been honing my skills at cooking and smoking meats since the age of 8 with my dad and grandfather. I am a simple man of few words with a dream to start my passion in life. </li>
<li>This campaign will allow my dream and passion for cooking and feeding people to come to fruition. With this I will be able to bring a whole new dining experience to my community and surrounding communities. </li>
<li>The ability to start this food truck will not only change my life, but, the lives of my family and community. As an owner of a locally owned and operated business this opportunity will allow the company to give back. As a first responder, giving back has been a part of my life for 28  years. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding for the entire project $186,400. For the campaign I am asking for the seed money of $100,000, which will secure the SBA loan for the rest of the cost and allow for the purchase of the start up foods, seasonings, wood, and serving products. </li>
<li>Perks! Everyone loves a perk! As a contributor you will receive a car decal.  A contribution of $50 you will receive a Smokin' Angels Q T-Shirt.

At the $1000 level a day with the chef to include how to select, prep, smoke, and pull the BBQ; This will be a local experience and the contributor would provide transportation to the food truck.  Should you feel lead to contribute $10,000 or more a catered dinner of all of the specialties of Smokin' Angels Q to feed 20. This will be offered once the food truck is running and able to travel within 500 miles of the local area here in South Carolina.</li>
<li>Should the goal not be met to allow Smokin' Angels Q to receive the loan from the SBA (Small Business Administration) the contributions will be held for a period of 6 months in order to run a second campaign to meet goals. After that 6 months if the goals have not been achieved contributions will be returned. </li>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any new venture there are risks and challenges. With a food truck that is a completely new and untested platform in this area, we perceive our risks are the short term excitement and turning that into long term customers and longevity on the whole. Our challenges include keeping pace with demand, keeping the products quality the same each time, and over coming any possible saturation of the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hurdles come and are meant to be overcome, as a Paramedic, I was taught to improvise, adapt, and overcome. I have the help of other proven restaurants to rely on for advice and guidance. I have a CPA who keeps all of the fiances on track. </li>
<li>I work with local purveyors of foods to keep supply available. The ability to be mobile and go to festivals and street fairs as well as advertising will assist in making and keeping customers as well as keeping Smokin' Angels Q current.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>Hello. We are Laurel Cook and Antonio Bonilla, owners of Spirit Bar.

<p>       Spirit Bar is a return to the original use of alcohol and spirits as medicine and connection to the land. Spirit Bar infusions and bitters can be used as herbal remedies and as a simple way to make a complex cocktail with less ingredients. Through sourcing local spirits and herbs we strive to support local farmers and distillers. Our infusions educate our customers on the history of alcohol as a vehicle for plant medicine. Our goal is to bring intention back to imbibement.</p>
<p>We are minority business owners raising money to get our company off the ground. Portland is a town where small businesses thrive, but only a small percentage are minority owned. After working in the service industry for at least a decade each, we are prepared to make our own way with an idea we care about deeply. </p>
<p>For over two years we have been developing recipes, educating ourselves in herbal medicine, and creating a buzz though tasting parties. Our local market is eagerly awaiting our products. Your contribution will help us turn this dream into a reality. </p>

<h3>Why We're Different</h3>
<p>We realize as cocktail enthusiasts that your local liquor store already has a whole shelf of flavored vodkas and traditional bitters. We feel that our products are unique enough to stand out. Spirit Bar infusions aren't created from artificial flavorings and don't contain added sugar. They are an exciting option for those with mature palates who are ready for something new and exciting.</p>

That’s the reaction we’ve gotten so far from the previews of our new coffeehouse space, as well as from those who have already tasted and/or ordered our in-house roasted coffee! Vibe Coffeehouse &amp; Café is about 80% ready to open its doors, but we realize now, we need a bit more help to truly make our space and our business the place that our community deserves. That’s why we’ve opened this campaign to raise funds to assist with the remaining start-up costs, so that the anticipation (ours and those awaiting our opening) toward opening our doors, can make way for actually opening. This coffeehouse, coming soon to the heart of downtown Lima, Ohio (as well as via our online store) will truly be an amazing space where all can come to enjoy the relaxed, urban, industrial space fit for a modernizing, growing, downtown! As you get into the holiday spirit, please consider help us get there! We’ll make it worth your while!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p><p>Vibe Coffeehouse &amp; Café is opening in the heart of downtown Lima with the intention of being the community’s chosen space to come to relax, socialize, or work, all while being exposed to world cultures and people over a delicious, locally roasted cup of coffee or other beverages and/or small food items. We will provide a unique, comfortable, and cool atmosphere, where learning also occurs, by utilizing the globally universal love of coffee (and tea), to expose the community to world cultures and people. We source our green coffee beans from responsible wholesales, distributors, farms, and cooperatives; and we specialize in African origin coffees, but we also have coffees from all over the world. Our focus on African coffees will be unique to the area, and we will utilize the owners direct connections to the Continent, to make sure we have the best, quality, and delicious African coffees available! Equally important, we roast our own coffee in-house, treating them gently and with care, so that you get fresh, flavorful coffee like you’ve never had before!</p><p> </p><p>The Coffeehouse was started by Carlton McLellan, a lover of coffeehouses as places for social engagement, relaxation, reflection, and inspiration. Joining Carlton in this dream, is long-time friend, William “Bill” Steward, who shares the commitment to the community and the wonderful things the coffeehouse can do for and in the community.</p><p> </p><p>Carton has spent time in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of coffeehouses on four of the world’s seven continents (and he hopes to do so on the remaining three continents that he has yet to visit) and he has enjoyed great coffees and diverse and engaging people and atmospheres in everyone one. He's recently spent a lot of time on the African continent, and as such, he's discovered a love of African coffees that he'll bring to Vibe and the community! This love and appreciation for the coffeehouse as a space, as well as for the coffee (and other beverages and foods served) itself, will be evident in Vibe’s space. Vibe, located in a large, remodeled, yet comfortable warehouse space, will invite the community in to enjoy “The Place, the Space, the Taste!”</p><p> </p><p>We tried to get the space ready using our own resources, and some great support from a couple of small business lending sources. After overcoming some hiccups along the way, we are as committed as ever to getting the space ready to open, and we are about 80% there. With your help, you can push us over the to! </p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><ul><li>Vibe Coffeehouse &amp; Café isn’t looking for charity…we’re looking for support from, and partnership with the community we seek to serve – our hometown community and lovers of great coffee and coffeehouses. We’re looking for you to donate/invest in us as we prepare to invest in you! For your support, you will not only have the satisfaction of knowing you have helped bring a vibrant, relaxing, and cool community space to downtown Lima, but you’ll also be rewarded with some amazing perks! Our perk structure is tiered and each tier builds off the previous one, so the more you donate/invest the more you get in return.  For instance, at the mid-range level ($200) you receive 1 pound of Vibe Roasted Coffee (single origin), a Vibe Family Member decal, a coupon for your first drink free in Vibe (drink of your choice, once we open), 15% Off Online Orders for Six Months, 15% Off In-House Orders, every Monday and Wednesday, for Six Months, and a Vibe Coffeehouse &amp; Café T-Shirt. The more you donate/invest, the better and better the great perks get! </li></ul><p> </p><ul>
<li>Vibe Coffeehouse &amp; Café is hoping to raise <strong><u>$25,000</u></strong> to help with start-up costs. Start-up costs include the following:<ul>

That’s the reaction we’ve gotten so far from the previews of our new coffeehouse space, as well as from those who have already tasted and/or ordered our in-house roasted coffee! Vibe Coffeehouse & Café is about 80% ready to open its doors, but we realize now, we need a bit more help to truly make our space and our business the place that our community deserves. That’s why we’ve opened this campaign to raise funds to assist with the remaining start-up costs, so that the anticipation (ours and those awaiting our opening) toward opening our doors, can make way for actually opening. This coffeehouse, coming soon to the heart of downtown Lima, Ohio (as well as via our online store) will truly be an amazing space where all can come to enjoy the relaxed, urban, industrial space fit for a modernizing, growing, downtown! As you get into the holiday spirit, please consider help us get there! We’ll make it worth your while! Short SummaryVibe Coffeehouse & Café is opening in the heart of downtown Lima with the intention of being the community’s chosen space to come to relax, socialize, or work, all while being exposed to world cultures and people over a delicious, locally roasted cup of coffee or other beverages and/or small food items. We will provide a unique, comfortable, and cool atmosphere, where learning also occurs, by utilizing the globally universal love of coffee (and tea), to expose the community to world cultures and people. We source our green coffee beans from responsible wholesales, distributors, farms, and cooperatives; and we specialize in African origin coffees, but we also have coffees from all over the world. Our focus on African coffees will be unique to the area, and we will utilize the owners direct connections to the Continent, to make sure we have the best, quality, and delicious African coffees available! Equally important, we roast our own coffee in-house, treating them gently and with care, so that you get fresh, flavorful coffee like you’ve never had before! The Coffeehouse was started by Carlton McLellan, a lover of coffeehouses as places for social engagement, relaxation, reflection, and inspiration. Joining Carlton in this dream, is long-time friend, William “Bill” Steward, who shares the commitment to the community and the wonderful things the coffeehouse can do for and in the community. Carton has spent time in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of coffeehouses on four of the world’s seven continents (and he hopes to do so on the remaining three continents that he has yet to visit) and he has enjoyed great coffees and diverse and engaging people and atmospheres in everyone one. He's recently spent a lot of time on the African continent, and as such, he's discovered a love of African coffees that he'll bring to Vibe and the community! This love and appreciation for the coffeehouse as a space, as well as for the coffee (and other beverages and foods served) itself, will be evident in Vibe’s space. Vibe, located in a large, remodeled, yet comfortable warehouse space, will invite the community in to enjoy “The Place, the Space, the Taste!” We tried to get the space ready using our own resources, and some great support from a couple of small business lending sources. After overcoming some hiccups along the way, we are as committed as ever to getting the space ready to open, and we are about 80% there. With your help, you can push us over the to!  What We Need & What You GetVibe Coffeehouse & Café isn’t looking for charity…we’re looking for support from, and partnership with the community we seek to serve – our hometown community and lovers of great coffee and coffeehouses. We’re looking for you to donate/invest in us as we prepare to invest in you! For your support, you will not only have the satisfaction of knowing you have helped bring a vibrant, relaxing, and cool community space to downtown Lima, but you’ll also be rewarded with some amazing perks! Our perk structure is tiered and each tier builds off the previous one, so the more you donate/invest the more you get in return.  For instance, at the mid-range level ($200) you receive 1 pound of Vibe Roasted Coffee (single origin), a Vibe Family Member decal, a coupon for your first drink free in Vibe (drink of your choice, once we open), 15% Off Online Orders for Six Months, 15% Off In-House Orders, every Monday and Wednesday, for Six Months, and a Vibe Coffeehouse & Café T-Shirt. The more you donate/invest, the better and better the great perks get!  
Vibe Coffeehouse & Café is hoping to raise $25,000 to help with start-up costs. Start-up costs include the following:
Cost associated with the leased space (rent, utilities, etc.)
Completion of renovations in the space including:
Instillation of updated electrical, HVAC, and plumbing systems and infrastructure
Point of sales system
Drive-Thru window resources (menu board, communications system, etc.)


Two weeks of operating costs (inventory, wages, etc.)
Soft Opening Community Preview Event


Even if Vibe Coffeehouse & Café does not reach our goal of $25,000 by the target date, the raised funds will still go towards the previously mentioned items. Whatever we don't raise through this campaign, we will continue to seek out ways to raise the needed funds to get the space open and ready to serve the community!

<h3><strong>But that purity is being challenged</strong></h3>
<p>Syrups from starch are being added to honey. These syrups have none of the richness of natural honey. None of the flavour and character – none of why people call honey “the nectar of the gods”</p>
<p><strong>It's time to stop this. People deserve to know what they are eating</strong></p>
<p>We are Jerry and Peter Awram, long-time beekeepers.  Jerry starting in 1956 and his son, Peter, grew up in the business. We’ve spent countless days searching for queens, splitting hives and pulling honey. We know bees and we know honey. </p>

<p>Real honey is like wine. It differs depending on the flowers the bees visit, the time of year and the weather.  All these combine to give a delectable flavour that can't be matched. People should be able to taste the sharp flavour of honey from Maple trees, the light taste of Fireweed and the pungency of Buckwheat. </p>
<p><strong>Starch Syrups have none of the richness of honey</strong></p>
<p>For well over a decade now, honey adulteration has been increasing at an alarming rate. The biggest food fraud case in history involved fraud in honey of over $80 million in 2010, but it didn't stop anything. Honey fraud has been getting worse since then.  Some countries have more than doubled the amount of honey they export with no increase in hive numbers. This is while hive yields in North and South America and Europe have declined. </p>
<h3>The numbers don't add up. The data show that up to 40% more honey is being sold than is being made by bees.</h3>

<h3>There is a new technology that allows detection of these Starch Syrups</h3>
<p>Magnetic Resonance is one of the most powerful analytical methods available today. MRI machines in hospitals use the same technology to image people's bodies.

<p>Our Honey Screener is a research quality Magnetic Resonance capable of examining a wide range of materials.

<p>Magnetic Resonance uses a super-conducting magnet to ""ring"" the honey sample like a bell - or a whole orchestra. Then you listen to the ""sound"" or resonance that comes back. Honey sounds like a rich symphony, while starch syrup is like the annoying buzz of the alarm clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Us: WELCOME! You have entered THE SURENTO FAMILY CAMPAIGN! We are- one rock-star mom and one art-king dad with a three-sibling-offspring-ring and one grand-baby-little-lady. </p>
<p>After lifetimes of playing the cards we were dealt (so-to-speak) we have decided to quit playing games and start a doughnut business! </p>
<p>You: Um what?</p>
<p>Us: DOUGHNUT BUSINESS!</p>
<p>You: Why?</p>
<p>Us: The idea came about one sunny morning on our way to the springs. We moved to North Central Florida almost 10 years ago to be closer to the rock-star mom’s family, Fort White, FL to be exact. Only to discover that one of the LARGEST aquifers (underground water supply) in the world lives right here! So as you may guess, tourists come from all over the world to visit the area to scuba dive, kayak, stand up paddle board, and float on tubes;) The latter happens to be the most popular activity and we live just a 5 minute drive from the most popular tube rental place around! </p>
<p>You: Oh yeah?</p>
<p>Us: Yeah! (see above video)</p>
<p>We started going tubing a lot and (of course) brought snacks and drinks with us every time. (You need some sustenance in the great outdoorsy swampy wilderness.) Those of you who know the art-king dad (Shooter) know that he LOVES SWEETS, well we all do but he especially, and we also all love COFFEE (who doesn’t).  NO ONE is selling snacks or drinks at these prime locations where an average of 1800 people a day are coming through. </p>
<p>You: Woah ! That's a lot.</p>
<p>Us: I know right?</p>
<p>Shooter has witnessed the success of mini donut stands at bike rallies all over the country while vending his airbrushed artwork. These guys were racking up big bucks on these tasty little things, SOOOOOOO we talked to the tube rental owners and a few locals and we all decided it would be a GREAT idea to open a mini doughnut and coffee stand!!!! That way you can come get your tubes and on your way to the water enjoy a sweet, fresh made snack!!</p>
<p>You: How would you go about doing that?</p>
<p>Us: By gathering together a community of supportive art and doughnut lovers and raising the funds needed to get this thing going! </p>

<h3>Deadline Brewing Project</h3>
<p>Hi there.  My name is Jason.  I'm co-owner of Deadline Brewing Project in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  We are a start-up craft brewery located a block from the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500858276/mcxr4kukdi9brg9rerny.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm the goofy looking one on the right.  My wife Erica is in the center.  Erica and I are TV news people here in the area.  </p>
<p>There on the left is Darrell, our head brewer.  Darrell is a former brewer for another local brewery and has won numerous awards in local and state beer competitions.</p>
<p>Darrell is also a former newspaper reporter.  When we sat back and thought about what we'd like to name the brewery it was a no brainer:  Deadline.  You'll see that news theme sprinkled in our brewery and beer names. You might even see a pattern with the perk levels! </p>
<p>Now we find ourselves literally under deadline.  Our goal is to provide our customers with an experience that will keep them coming back for more.  </p>
<p>We decided to start this campaign to help get us over the hump.  We are trying to fund this brewery by ourselves.  We could have gone out and gotten some financial backers,  but we didn't want to do that.  We really wanted to make this thing work on our own.</p>
<p>For the most part we have reached our goal, but we are a bit short.  With your help, we can live out our dream and get to brewing.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Another $15,000 would go a looooong way.  Over the past 8 months we've been renovating two parcels which make up 2,000 square feet.  We've been doing most of the work ourselves and there has been a lot of money going out and nothing coming in.</p>
<p>Here's what the place looked like before we took over in December:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500859305/j0c0sixcz6sg3nmrhnat.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And here is what it looks like today:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500859555/hodppabxskamamjinvt7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We think we are a month away from opening, but as you can see there are still things we need to buy.  That includes tables and bar stools for starters.  We haven't purchased cash registers.  And yes, we have the brewing equipment, but we haven't bought kegs.  All of this adds up very quickly.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Deadline Brewing Project
Hi there.  My name is Jason.  I'm co-owner of Deadline Brewing Project in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  We are a start-up craft brewery located a block from the Chesapeake Bay.
 

 
I'm the goofy looking one on the right.  My wife Erica is in the center.  Erica and I are TV news people here in the area.  
There on the left is Darrell, our head brewer.  Darrell is a former brewer for another local brewery and has won numerous awards in local and state beer competitions.
Darrell is also a former newspaper reporter.  When we sat back and thought about what we'd like to name the brewery it was a no brainer:  Deadline.  You'll see that news theme sprinkled in our brewery and beer names. You might even see a pattern with the perk levels! 
Now we find ourselves literally under deadline.  Our goal is to provide our customers with an experience that will keep them coming back for more.  
We decided to start this campaign to help get us over the hump.  We are trying to fund this brewery by ourselves.  We could have gone out and gotten some financial backers,  but we didn't want to do that.  We really wanted to make this thing work on our own.
For the most part we have reached our goal, but we are a bit short.  With your help, we can live out our dream and get to brewing.
What We Need & What You Get

Another $15,000 would go a looooong way.  Over the past 8 months we've been renovating two parcels which make up 2,000 square feet.  We've been doing most of the work ourselves and there has been a lot of money going out and nothing coming in.
Here's what the place looked like before we took over in December:

 
And here is what it looks like today:

 
We think we are a month away from opening, but as you can see there are still things we need to buy.  That includes tables and bar stools for starters.  We haven't purchased cash registers.  And yes, we have the brewing equipment, but we haven't bought kegs.  All of this adds up very quickly.
Our goal is make unique craft beer.  We plan to use a lot of fresh fruits to give each one the flavor that beer deserves.
As you'll see, we are offering several unique perks for contributing.   Of course we have t-shirts and stickers and koozies,  but how about getting to brew with Darrell for the day.  He looks like a fun guy to hang with.  A gig where drinking on the job is encouraged!!!
If that's not your thing, how about being forever immortalized with beer named after YOU.  You might even enjoy sipping on that brew at private party for you and your closest friends.
Every little bit helps and we really just appreciate the fact that you've read up to this point.  Even if we don't reach our goal it will definitely help us get closer to getting the doors open.  
If you can't contribute, no worries.  How about letting your friends know!  We hope they'll be just as excited as we are.

<h3>The Little Urban Story</h3>
<p>    We are Chad Urban and Bobby Little, we have a combined experience of 20 years working in the restaurant industry. Bob grew up working in deli’s &amp; steakhouses in Kentucky. Chef Bob took this love for the hospitality industry, went to culinary school and found his way into the Michelin Star kitchens of California and New York. Chef Chad, grew up bouncing around the Midwest, finally landing on Cape Cod, MA. He grew up working in his dads factory &amp; doing odd jobs from construction to dishwashing on a military base. He learned to enjoy hard work and working with his hands, following in his dads footsteps to open his own business he enrolled in the Culinary Institute of America. After school he moved to Manhattan and began working in Michelin star kitchens.</p>

<p>    This campaign is to help us create a collaborative restaurant that is based on our personal experiences growing up and cooking in professional kitchens. It has been our dream to create a restaurant and own our own business since we met. It is our goal to build an environment that is positive, fun and that benefits our employees. After working for years in kitchens and restaurants across the city and country. It is easy to see that employees are not always the most appreciated. We want to change that, we want to give our employees insurance, higher wages, benefits, paid time off &amp; educational trips. We want to give back to the community with monthly charity dinners, that benefit a local or national cause. With this restaurant it is not only our vision to create a successful business, but to give back. </p>
<p>    The magnitude of your support, is beyond words. We could never fully express how much your contribution would mean to us. Because that support would make our dreams come true. </p>
<h3>Fundraising Goal</h3>
</div><div><p>Our goal is to get $50,000 to get the keys for a beautiful restaurant space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. Starting a restaurant is not cheap, making the dining room come to life will take some elbow grease, time and materials. Equipment is another story, our top priority is to invest in equipment that is durable. We do not need the fanciest tools on the market, but we need the most reliable. To execute the type of cuisine we want to serve, we will need an array of ovens for baking, roasting and braising, a grill to bring freshness and depth to our vegetables and a workhorse of a stove that will keep the kitchen running hot and smooth. Gathering small tools will be essential as well spatulas to flip some sizzling meats, tongs to rotate the vegetables on the grill, whisks to whip up some lavish mousses &amp; strainers for our rich soups.</p></div><div>
<h3>Little Urban Mission</h3>
<p>We have been working and running successful restaurants collectively for 20 years. Now we cannot wait to bring Little Urban Food &amp; Drinks to life! For the past 3 years we have been living and socializing in Williamsburg, we realized its missing something… a restaurant that is built around serving the neighborhood, reminiscent of the restaurants we grew up knowing &amp; loving. The Little Urban culture will be to invest in our employees as well as our community. To create a family that extends beyond work &amp; that cultivates a strong neighborhood bond.</p>
<p>We want to invite people to help our movement &amp; in return get some gear, discounts and experiences that will help us get the keys to our new restaurant. </p>
<h3>The Start</h3>
<p>Running a restaurant is hard, factor in New York and it can be intense! Together we have opened over half a dozen restaurants, with that cumulative experience, we know the amount of hard-work and dedication it takes to open and operate a restaurant smoothly. It is because of that experience,  that we are ready to get started on our own project. </p>

Of course, you are!VURRITO™ will be Rhode Island’s first, whole-food, plant-based, Mexican-Inspired food truck. Sourcing fresh, local, and 100% vegan ingredients. Oh, and did we mention? We’re here to change how New England eats! Lets face it. You're probably thinking about food right now. Food is an extremely important part of our lives. Food is much more than just getting nutrients into our body (If we even get that!). Food is a meal, a date, a business meeting, a casual encounter, a way to recharge, a reason to spend time with an old friend, a way to break up the workday, a way to take that much-needed moment to yourself.Here's the problem. With our increasingly busy schedules we rarely have time for a healthy delicious meal. The current “quick and easy” options are not good for us and we know it. They leave us feeling sick and unsatisfied. Most of us grab the nearest, cheapest, and quickest thing we can find only to realize later that you end up tired, drained and ready to call it quits.

<p>  We are passionate about building community in honest and tangible ways.One of those ways is to bring local business people together to work in ways that make things better for everyone.. The talent that Kristi and I bring to this commitment is customer service, and by using this ability in support of local farmers we have built a reputation of serving excellent products in a friendly manner to the people of Carrollton. For us the next step in working with our local farmers is to expand the market for their goods which is currently bottle-necked. It is important to expand the market so that our farmers can spend more of their time doing what they love and less time marketing and delivering their goods. This new venture will also open the market up to more of our neighbors to enjoy fresh local food. For 18 years our local donut maker had the best spot in Carrollton, its at the corner of 2 highways with 2 entrances where 30,000 people drive by everyday. No one was expecting him to close down so we weren’t prepared with capital when it happened, but we believe in what we’re doing, took a leap of faith, and signed the contract. Now we have less than a month to buy the equipment and get the place fixed up. The donut maker is selling his equipment and building to us at a very good price so that he doesn’t have to move it. We have given him 20% of his asking price, and he has given us a month to raise the rest of the money which is where this campaign comes in. We need to get enough to do some renovations, get a few more pieces of equipment, and cover start-up costs. We need great employees and want to pay a good wage while keeping our prices as low as possible.  This is good for everybody. It will be much easier to do all of this if we don’t have to borrow any money. We are asking for the bare minimum to get open, but if we get more, we will put it to good use for improvements like installing central air and inside seating.</p>
<p>We love to share perks so check them out. If you can’t contribute please share the campaign far and wide.</p>

With the help of my mom, we bought 200 cookies the previous night, and along with my dad, we created a stand in front of our driveway. </p><p>The next morning, I was up bright and early, ready for the excitement of the day to begin. So many people came by to my stand and absolutely loved this go-getter, entrepreneurial spirit of mine! I was overjoyed with the amount of love and support I had received from our community, and from that day on, I knew I wanted to bake my own cookies EVERY SINGLE DAY and share them with our neighborhood, city, state, country, even the world, to put a smile on a face, to make someone’s day a little brighter.</p><p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540911458/h1hmhcy1mcbxkbh1uv9e.png"" src=""""/>                                   </p><p>Now granted, since I was 8 that was not possible, as I had to go to school the following Monday! However, I sat down with my parents and we created a plan to grow the idea of Jordan’s Cookies and expand it into concept, and in the future, a fully-functioning business. </p><p>In 2008, when I was 8 years old, Jordan’s Cookies was born. I partnered with a family friend who had experience in catering to help us get the business off the ground. We worked on flavors, packaging, and delivery with her original recipe. Our then partner realized that she wanted to retire from the food business, so we were left with having to re-establish the brand independently. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540911574/fq4p5f7vnuzheniicxad.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>With the help of my mom, and countless days of trial-and-error, we established what is known as our Original and Signature Jordan’s Cookies Cookie Dough. </p><p><strong>YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH</strong></p><p>Over the next few years, we had marginal success by selling small orders of cookies in my neighborhood and to family friends while still managing school and extracurricular activities. </p><p>Around this time, my grandmother who has since past away, was battling various forms of cancer. As a family, we have always been tied to service, giving back, and helping others, and we donated 10% of the proceeds of every single order to the “Susan G. Komen Foundation for Cancer Research” further cultivating our slogan, “Where Sweetness Makes a Difference”. </p><p>I also created a nonprofit organization called “Change for Cures” where students in local schools would compete between classrooms to see who could raise the most money in a given period of time. The classroom that raised the most amount of money received a Cookies and Milk Party sponsored by Jordan’s Cookies. </p><p>Making additional steps towards growth, in 2013 we established our first fully functioning e-commerce website that drastically improved and expanded our brand to a national level. As we continued to grow and expand, we have moved out of the driveway and are currently renting space in a commercial kitchen facility—a great blessing by a friend and fellow baking mentor—where we have a team of volunteers who help us bake and package every order. </p><p><strong>AWARDS AND PRESS</strong></p><p>As business grew exponentially, there we’re many nights of baking until 3 am and waking up for school at 5 am, but I managed to make it work. We’ve served thousands of people, won several local and international awards, have spoken to a variety of audiences, and have been able to work with countless companies including Williams-Sonoma, FedEx and ReMax, just to name a few. I currently serve as the Teen Entrepreneur of the year for the Gwinnett County Public School System in Georgia, the most diverse in the Southeast with over 900,000 residents.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540913607/vyfz2zvn5baxyzorl9qb.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540914017/vygfpu1ngftgbsk4xhfz.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">FUNDING UTILIZATION</span></strong></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Now, lets talk about our plan of action for future growth.

This means, that we have to bulk all orders, regardless of when they are placed online, into one mass ship day.</p><p>As a brand, it is our main priority to care for our customers as we would want to be cared for by the brands we love and support. Through our own warehouse facility, we would have the freedom to process orders everyday of the week, providing an overall better experience for our customers.</p><p>Once we have the funds to open the facility, we would need the equipment for operation.

The application process is open to all, and from the many deserving candidates, we will select a few to award.</p><p> </p><p>The JC Intensives, an annual 3-4 day retreat, selects 10 students (with up to 2 guests) who have started the beginning phases of running a company. From meeting some dynamic business leaders to forming a network with the other kids, we will provide information that can be put into practice on their own for the future. </p><p> </p><p>The Workshop Conferences, a yearly Forum event where thousands of students, primarily from lower income communities, will have the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship and the possibilities of forming their own company. A full day event, we will provide 3 meals, snacks, and a fun activity. With guest speakers, breakout groups, a Q &amp; A session, plus teaching them how to turn their interests and talents into a business, the children will begin to view lives and futures from a different perspective.</p><p> </p><p><strong>IN CLOSING</strong></p><p>That being said, I cannot do this alone.

With the help of my mom, we bought 200 cookies the previous night, and along with my dad, we created a stand in front of our driveway. The next morning, I was up bright and early, ready for the excitement of the day to begin. So many people came by to my stand and absolutely loved this go-getter, entrepreneurial spirit of mine! I was overjoyed with the amount of love and support I had received from our community, and from that day on, I knew I wanted to bake my own cookies EVERY SINGLE DAY and share them with our neighborhood, city, state, country, even the world, to put a smile on a face, to make someone’s day a little brighter.                                     Now granted, since I was 8 that was not possible, as I had to go to school the following Monday! However, I sat down with my parents and we created a plan to grow the idea of Jordan’s Cookies and expand it into concept, and in the future, a fully-functioning business. In 2008, when I was 8 years old, Jordan’s Cookies was born. I partnered with a family friend who had experience in catering to help us get the business off the ground. We worked on flavors, packaging, and delivery with her original recipe. Our then partner realized that she wanted to retire from the food business, so we were left with having to re-establish the brand independently. With the help of my mom, and countless days of trial-and-error, we established what is known as our Original and Signature Jordan’s Cookies Cookie Dough. YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTHOver the next few years, we had marginal success by selling small orders of cookies in my neighborhood and to family friends while still managing school and extracurricular activities. Around this time, my grandmother who has since past away, was battling various forms of cancer. As a family, we have always been tied to service, giving back, and helping others, and we donated 10% of the proceeds of every single order to the “Susan G. Komen Foundation for Cancer Research” further cultivating our slogan, “Where Sweetness Makes a Difference”. I also created a nonprofit organization called “Change for Cures” where students in local schools would compete between classrooms to see who could raise the most money in a given period of time. The classroom that raised the most amount of money received a Cookies and Milk Party sponsored by Jordan’s Cookies. Making additional steps towards growth, in 2013 we established our first fully functioning e-commerce website that drastically improved and expanded our brand to a national level. As we continued to grow and expand, we have moved out of the driveway and are currently renting space in a commercial kitchen facility—a great blessing by a friend and fellow baking mentor—where we have a team of volunteers who help us bake and package every order. AWARDS AND PRESSAs business grew exponentially, there we’re many nights of baking until 3 am and waking up for school at 5 am, but I managed to make it work. We’ve served thousands of people, won several local and international awards, have spoken to a variety of audiences, and have been able to work with countless companies including Williams-Sonoma, FedEx and ReMax, just to name a few. I currently serve as the Teen Entrepreneur of the year for the Gwinnett County Public School System in Georgia, the most diverse in the Southeast with over 900,000 residents.FUNDING UTILIZATIONNow, lets talk about our plan of action for future growth. We are so very thankful for the opportunity to share the commercial kitchen facility we are currently operating in, however as we continue to grow and expand, we realize that for maximum efficiency it is necessary for us to operate within our own facility.Currently, Jordan’s Cookies is solely an online business, and upon fulfilling orders, we are only available to bake, package, and ship once a week in the shared space. This means, that we have to bulk all orders, regardless of when they are placed online, into one mass ship day.As a brand, it is our main priority to care for our customers as we would want to be cared for by the brands we love and support. Through our own warehouse facility, we would have the freedom to process orders everyday of the week, providing an overall better experience for our customers.Once we have the funds to open the facility, we would need the equipment for operation. Down below is a list of all items necessary to instill in the bakery: Equipment, Utility, Supplies, Packaging, Ingredients, and Salary Pay. The Jordan Johnson FoundationThe Jordan Johnson Foundation, established in 2018 by Teen Entrepreneur Jordan Johnson, works to uplift and provide support for the youth in their beginning entrepreneurial journeys. There are 3 main components to the Foundation: Scholarship Funds, The JC Intensives, and The Workshop Conferences. Yearly, the Foundation plans to donate Scholarships to various high school seniors around the country, who plan to pursue a degree in a business/entrepreneurial venture. The application process is open to all, and from the many deserving candidates, we will select a few to award. The JC Intensives, an annual 3-4 day retreat, selects 10 students (with up to 2 guests) who have started the beginning phases of running a company. From meeting some dynamic business leaders to forming a network with the other kids, we will provide information that can be put into practice on their own for the future.  The Workshop Conferences, a yearly Forum event where thousands of students, primarily from lower income communities, will have the opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship and the possibilities of forming their own company. A full day event, we will provide 3 meals, snacks, and a fun activity. With guest speakers, breakout groups, a Q & A session, plus teaching them how to turn their interests and talents into a business, the children will begin to view lives and futures from a different perspective. IN CLOSINGThat being said, I cannot do this alone. With the help of you, my dreams can be made possible. To be in this situation is humbling and I am extremely thankful for those that have helped me get to the position I am in now. This is not simply my business, anyone and everyone who has contributed to the JC brand in all ways possible is a blessing in my life, and plays a vital role in the future growth of Jordan's Cookies.I push myself to be the best that I can be, to achieve the impossible, for those that believe in me, for those that look up to me, for the future generations.As the CEO and Founder of Jordan’s Cookies from a young age, I have learned that you never know what could come if you do not try, the answer will always be no if you do not ask, and you cannot succeed if you do not start with something.I can assure you that I am passionate, able, capable, and will do everything in my power to build, grow, and expand this business towards success.

An invention of mine was once chosen one of the 100 most significant products developed in the world! This is better!And, I love chocolate chip cookies!Chocolate chips are ""America's cookies!"" I grew up on great chocolate chip cookies back in the Woodstock era, before the large corporations morphed them into cardboard tasting masses of over-sweet dough, inferior chocolate, synthesized oils, and unhealthy sweeteners. My chocolate chip cookies are my legacy and a great big ""thank you"" to AMERICA, the high point of my career. Call me old fashioned BUTOver the recent past a few large corporations and investment banks have quietly scooped-up virtually all of the developing brands of quality, chocolate chip cookies. They bought distribution, and once their initial business model was fulfilled.. they dropped the hammer, degraded the product and sold-out the American public.  I hate that.Corners are cut and quality is compromised. The brands are milked and the American public is bilked. This has happened repeatedly.I'd go to the store and buy cookies that used to be amazing. I'd open the package and notice the cookies looked a little different. I bite in and that's when the betrayal hits. They've sold me out!Americans should NOT be sold-out.  Giving you what you deserve!Our homemade-style cookies are natural and made with only the highest quality ingredients REAL butter, FRESH eggs, Madagascar vanilla and the FINEST, Belgian chocolate. Space-age technologyOur proprietary technology (developed first for the U.S. space program) allows our cookies to retain their ""just baked"" freshness without the use of synthesized oils, preservatives or chemical ANYTHING!  But the story doesn't end there. We learned how to bake them in massive scale and provide them at a price that can compete with all the lesser quality, commodity cookies!The Results......from Kevin Smith (filmmaker, actor, podcaster) “The cookies are really good. I may even go on record to say they ARE the best chocolate chip cookies I’ve ever had. And when you open the box, you fall down a rabbit hole of Bart’s life...” How We're The BestWe don’t believe in gluttony or tricking people into eating beyond what makes them feel comfortable - so our cookies are bite-size, naturally, deliciously portion controlled, so to speak.I'm not a television personality and I'm not a spokesman but, people love our cookies so much that on several occasions I sold over 2 million cookies on QVC in under 8 minutes! Shark Tank & Bad Advice Contrary to Shark Tank advice, high quality food products are NEVER outsourced to co-packers!  That's why we bake every cookie in-house and all of our cookie-makers have been with us for the full life of this 7-year-old company. And many worked with us in our previous family business. We're a family and a team and we take great pride in baking The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies In The World!  Why Indiegogo Now? A few weeks ago the building where we make the cookies was put up for sale without prior notice.

It's short for Tsubasa. I used to eat a lot of meat and dairy, but a series of health issues led me to a plant-based diet. I was in my early 30's and was willing to try anything.

So I started seeking out plant-based snacks and instant soups that I could enjoy with my busy schedule. I was horrified to find that all the instant soups I tried tasted terrible, and many were made with highly processed ingredients of unknown origins. This ignited a fire in me, and led me to find my true calling: creating delicious plant-based soups made from clean and traceable ingredients! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585549159/k4jvppirkt149tcwhlmj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>WHAT'S SPECIAL?</strong></p><p>Following my Japanese roots, I began making soups with Japanese miso, an ancient paste made from fermented soybeans which is packed with natural probiotics and enzymes.  The miso used in Tsubi Soup has been made by the same family since the 1800's Edo period. Instead of using seafood for the dashi — a fundamental stock in Japanese cuisine that adds depth and savory flavor — I created the umami essence using wild seaweed and shiitake mushrooms.
