<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Paranormal Magic is a passion project that has been picked up by a television production company! However we soon realized that in order to bring our vision to the screen we have to produce the show ourselves!  With so many fans of magic and horror we don't want this show watered down!</p>

<li>This Campaign is so important to our team because I have wanted to do this for years also I'm  a creator for four other television magicians who you all know.  By producing the television series without hollywood watering down subject matter and style you the viewer will see pure magic, mind reading and see exactly what the artist has wanted to show the world! .</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding will be used for paying for camera crew also major actors not as secret helpers but as Victims lol ! Netflix is very specific on the equipment used in filming its shows we have to use Netflix approved camers.  We have to pay for each location also the celebrities that will appear on the show.  The show will start with a short horror film that requires a makeup artist, actors and film crew: we have J Anthony Kosar 2 time winner of SyFy's hit television show FACE OFF as our makeup artist!.  Also Paranormal Magic will require a PR company employed full time!  Having a PR firm will ensure that the word is out before Paranormal Magic is on television, this includes Magazine write ups, appearances on Jimmy Fallon, Ellen and local news shows!</li>
<li>T-shirts, Blu Rays and producer credits on the show are just some of our perks!</li>
<li>As stated before some funds go to PR, paying for locations, new magic apparatus, paying celebrities for appearances, music licences, air fare, hotels, television crews and so on.</li>

They struggle to maintain the Detroit landmark while big-money developers gobble up the city around them.

However, the series is not without joy and laugh-out-loud humor.

It is appalling to me that this issue is still unknown to most people, and I know this episode will help to bring the awareness it needs.Lastly, this project is giving work to musical theater writers for which I know we are all extremely grateful, especially during a pandemic. It is such a privilege not only to work but to get to work in your chosen field. It has helped to restore a sense of purpose and dignity.""Natalie Rebecca Lovejoycomposer/lyricist

<h3>In Nero: Black Girls in Rome</h3>
<p>Have you ever toyed with the idea of just tossing everything you own in storage, throwing caution to the wind, and starting over somewhere new?</p>
<p>In Nero: Black Girls in Rome is a fiction web series loosely based on the creator's experience of taking a huge leap of faith and moving abroad to Italy after suffering a broken heart.</p>
<p>I'm Tamara--said creator. I also write children's books, curate for artists, and generally do what I like and enjoy in life. It's been a long, windy road, but I believe this web series will provide an entertaining and inspiring as well as fresh perspective on the creative existence as well as the treasures that await when we just get comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I never really set out to film enough footage for a first season. But that's how the creative process works, isn't it? It's unexpected and addictive! What was supposed to be a pilot episode is now just shy of sufficient content for seven or eight short episodes. We (the crew) are just looking for funding to add a few necessary scenes to ensure the series pops the way it should and to ensure stellar post-production. Making stuff ain't cheap, ya'll, and this series was mostly self-funded and powered by favors from a host of incredibly gracious and talented people (painters, filmmakers, actors, musicians &amp; more).</p>
<p>Check out the trailer for the web series here--</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">As the creator of Black Girls in Rome, I believe that this project is timely and necessary. I think that Black and Italian cultures, curiously enough, have something in common as far as how they're portrayed in the media--mainstream outlets rarely (if ever) get the two cultures right. I mean, from over-exaggerated accents to stereotyped roles, Black folks and Italians can't seem to catch a break when it comes to how they're shown in shows. This series provides an interesting and authentic glimpse into Italian life from an ethnic expat's perspective, and captures just a bit of the whimsy and wonder that the eternal city and its inhabitants have to offer.</p>
<p>The cast and crew filmed in three continents and several cities. From NYC to Rome to Morocco, this web series displays mobility and the beauty of naturally occurring cultural exchanges amongst true friends. </p>
<p>Finally, to be honest, I'm not a professional actress. I decided to execute this web series to make good on a bet with myself. After losing my sister and only sibling to cancer in March of 2014, I decided that I would give myself permission to thrive. I am committed to doing all the things that pop into my mind as good ideas. I made the decision to be fearless and to do the work that I feel needs to be done. The thought of a bunch of people seeing me do something that I'd never done before with no formal training (see: write a scripted series, direct it, produce it, act in it) terrified the **** outta me...and that's precisely why I did it. My life has taught me in the last couple of years that if you just push past the fear, only treasures lie on the other side of the obstacles.</p>
<p>We've all got these great ideas, I believe--ideas that are persistently knocking on our imagination's door gently requesting permission to be pulled into reality through us. </p>
<p>In Nero: Black Girls in Rome is one of those gentle ideas, and we're right on the cusp of having a finished product that can be shared and discussed around the globe. We're asking for some assistance in the final stretch, and thank you for considering throwing your support behind the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Check out the perks for this campaign because they really are incredible.</p>
<p>It's my opinion that high art is funding high art with this indiegogo project, and there's something for everyone in the perks.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise at least $10,000--but oh, what we could do with a bit more! With the funding, the more you have, the more you can do. So even once filming is complete or editing is all wrapped up, there's still so much work to do that requires significant financial resources. Meeting and exceeding our goal would allow us to put resources into making sure as many eyes as possible see the web series, through advertisements and other campaigns. We'd also love to submit to festivals as well as hold screenings.</p>
<p>So, I figure $10,000 is an attainable goal. Theoretically all we need is 100 friends to donate $100, or 200 friends to donate $50, and we're all set.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier in the campaign, making quality stuff isn't cheap. And once filming is a wrap, production is far from over. Scoring, color correction, laborious editing, voiceovers, submitting to festivals, looking for distributors and more are all expenses to consider.</p>
<p>We understand the amount we're looking to raise is significant, and we believe the perks listed warrant the amount we seek to obtain. From chiseled stone to a dress specifically designed for this project to masterpieces painted by a renowned Italian artist, we hope to have provided perks that are as unique as the In Nero: Black Girls in Rome project itself.</p>
<p>Check out the image gallery to view the perks. They're gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>There's no such thing as a little bit of help with a project like this. Every single cent counts--every gesture, and every kind and motivating word means the world. Every dollar has a huge impact. I've put so much into In Nero: Black Girls in Rome and its development and so have countless other creatives who believed in the project from the very beginning. So if you find it to be a project worth your time and generosity, you're joining a family of creatives here who believe that this web series can really make a difference for viewers.</p>
<p>As we like to say in Texas, this isn't my first time at the rodeo. I've done a few crowd funding campaigns successfully in the past. In fact, my first children's book, The Ghanaian Goldilocks, which is award-winning, (I've published eight to date) was funded via crowd funding. You can trust that your donation is going to be used in the ways described above to assist in producing an incredible web series that you can be proud you were a part of creating.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's an old Italian proverb that says, ""Tra dire e fare c'e di mezzo il mare."" Loosely translated that means the sea lies between saying you're going to do something and actually doing it. Even though we've completed most of the filming for the series, there are still some challenges to overcome. Sticking to a strict timeline for editing can be a bit difficult. We're shooting to launch the series in the summer, so that really leaves a couple of months for the last bit of shooting and all the post production to be executed. However, I'm confident that everything can be completed in a timely manner.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Like what this campaign is about? PLeAsE--Make like Bob Marley and pass it on!</p>
<p>Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, email, smoke signals--whatever works!</p>
<p>We'd love and appreciate your support.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here's the thing. Animation is expensive, which is probably the reason you don't see much of it in Australia. We plan to keep the entire production in Australia, so the bottom line is the majority of the funds will be channeled into illustration and animation production costs. And Animators and Illustrators do not qualify for the Governments new $4/hr ‘internship’ scheme. We do this for fun, but our partners do this for a living so we need to pay them. See the graph below for a top-line budget breakdown.</p>

Aussie Gen Y'ers and Millennial's are both generations of Young Adults raised on American adult animated comedies, there's not a single one among us that couldn't riff a Simpsons quote – ""DENTAL PLAN!"" We believe Australian adult animation is grossly underrepresented on both TV and Online. This is something we want to change, and with your help we'll give it a red hot go!

 

Schooled! is an Australian adult animated comedy project by Ryan Clayton, Jess Wheeler and Tim O'Shea, that aims to independently fund and produce a 7 minute pilot, with the help of collaborators from Indiegogo. And, like most great adult animated series, it’s a bit fucked up. We love Rick & Morty. We love Archer. We love Bojack Horseman. But we want to bring some Australian flavour to the Adult Swim-esque world of balls-to-the-wall animated shows.

Here's the thing. Animation is expensive, which is probably the reason you don't see much of it in Australia. We plan to keep the entire production in Australia, so the bottom line is the majority of the funds will be channeled into illustration and animation production costs. And Animators and Illustrators do not qualify for the Governments new $4/hr ‘internship’ scheme. We do this for fun, but our partners do this for a living so we need to pay them. See the graph below for a top-line budget breakdown.
 

Because we've opted for flexible funding, regardless of how much funding we receive, we'll still be distributing it in the same way, it just means a higher quality production for each division.
 


Thanks for lending us your eyes and ears! We hope our pitch has excited you as much as it excites us and has inspired you to open your heart... but mostly your wallet. If it is the later, thank you in advance from the bottom of our ass... is that the saying?! You're a bloody legend! 

Q:  Don't you actually have to be funny to create a sitcom?
A:  Well, we haven't seen this explicitly stated in any of the rule books yet, so we're just going to keep pretending until we get busted. Shhhhhh!!!
Q:  If Alex Williamson, Nick Boshier and David Quirk say no, can I audition for a role?
A:  Let's be honest, they're probably all going to say no, so... we'll pretty much take anything we can get. That and the fact there's heaps of other roles to fill. If you fancy yourself as a bit of a voice talent pick a character(s), and send your audition to us here. 
Q:  When do I receive my Prizes & Rewards?
A:  Hold your bloody horses. We've listed the Estimated Delivery date for each perk in the item description, but just so you know they won't be ordered until the campaign is completed so we can minimise wastage. Also, sometimes delays in production happen, but we'll notify you if this is the case.
Q: Can I upgrade to another Perk?
A: Unfortunately not through Indiegogo if you've already contributed, but we recommend simply donating the difference and contacting Ryan Clayton directly. He loves a sneaky DM.
Q: What if I forgot to add postage to my order?
A: It should be added automatically at checkout. If not, similar to the procedure for Perk upgrades, organise a separate payment with Ryan Clayton directly so we can actually ship you your order.
Q:  Why can I only use PayPal to make my contribution?
A:  This is an Indiegogo thing, but it's basically to do with ease of handling Aussie dollars. You can read more about it here. It's no biggie though, you can still use your credit card to pay without creating an account. If our Mum's can do it, so can you. Just follow the prompts at checkout.
Q:  Can I claim my contribution back on tax?
A:  That all depends how 'creative' your accountant is. The short answer is no. Because we're not a charity and we're offering goods in exchange for your contribution, we don't qualify to issue tax deductible gift receipts. But consider how great it will feel knowing you've helped bring an original Aussie adult animation to life, better than any tax return we've had.
Q:  What are you guys going to do with all this money?
A:  Strippers and cocaine mostly. For whatever is left, see our Production Budget Breakdown on the main page. Regardless of how much  funding we receive, we'll still be distributing it in the same way, it just means a higher quality production for each division and we can extend the length of our bender.
Q:  So is this money to produce the entire series?
A:  We wish it was that cheap to create an entire series. This amount is to fund a 7 minute pilot which we will make available to everyone (eventually) on YouTube and Facebook and then pitch it to production companies.
Q:  Why don't you just apply for a Government film grant or something?
A:  Do you really think the Government would trust Tim with money? We actually would have, but because we've only got ads under our belts, we don't qualify. You have to already be credited on a film or short. The irony is we make films and shorts for a living... just in an advertisingy-30-seconds-at-a-time-type-cram-the-product-in sort of way. 
Q:  Why could you afford a slick crowdfunding video but not a measly 7 minute animation?
A:  Are we on trial here or what? Jeez. When you have generous friends who happen to be directors, cinematographers, producers, editors, writers and art directors who love an idea, amazing things can happen... and if you weepily beg them, they pity you and then are forced to work for free. Most of us are doing this for fun, but the craftspeople who will be physically creating the show do this for a living. They have to pay for equipment, staff and studio hire. And that ain't cheap.
Q:  Why don't you just pay for it yourself?
A:  Righto money bags! Settle down. Some of us still have HECS debts and enjoy the odd smashed avocado latte every now and then. The fact is we are all paying for it in one way or another. Some are contributing large sums of cold hard cash. Some are donating many hours of their time and expertise. But we're still a few goon sacks short of a punch party, and what better way to build an engaged audience in the process than through a crowdfunding campaign.
Q:  If I pay to have a character created in my likeness will they appear in the pilot?
A:  Yep. Sure will. There is a big Beer Pong Championship party scene which your character will appear in. We promise not to kill you off for at least 2, maybe even 3 episodes.
Q:  Do you really have a Cayman Islands account? Is that where my money is going?
A:  Well, not under the aliases we used in the video. We're not stupid. Where possible all dollars raised will stay on Australian shores to go towards production of the Animation and sorting out those sweet-sweet prizes & incentives. 

Q:  Did you draw the characters yourself?
A:  We wish. That's the handy work of the uber talented illustrator Simon Childerhouse and in the case of the storyboards, Sacha Bryning. We need funding to unleash these two further to bring this thing to life with the help of our Animation Director Cameron Gough.
Q:  Can Ryan please create a finger painting for me?
A:  Ryan will probably do anything for contributions. Well, not anything... let's keep it to fingerprinting until things get desperate. Hit us up on Facebook if you have a special request and we'll put him to work. 
Q:  Can I ask another question not listed here?
A:  Yeah mate. Just hit us up on our email here or access our media kit here.",26.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Charity Shop</h3>
<p>As this is will be our last production we ever make at westminster we would like to go out with a bang. We've spent time writing a great script that we're all extremely proud of and are working hard in order to do it justice. It's a great idea, a great concept and really showcases who we've become throughout our three year degree. Together we have made a number of productions but none like this. With your help we are guaranteed to make this dream a reality. Any donation is a step towards achieving our goal so if you can and if you believe in us as much as we believe in ourselves then please help us get there. Please help us make this production look as authentic and professional as it possibly can.</p>

<p>We are hoping to raise £500 to cover the cost of our actors and extras travel, printing, refreshments for cast and supporting cast, costumes, props and set design.<br/>Depending on the amount you donate, contributors will receive a credited thanks at the end of our programme, a 'The Charity Shop' poster signed by the writers and cast, exclusive behind the scenes digital images, a 'The Charity Shop' T-Shirt or a ' The Charity Shop' Thank You card signed by the crew and producers.</p>

Just because we are students doesn't mean that we are less capable of creating something great and worth backing. We are talented and hard working and work just as hard as people in the industry. Sometimes even harder as we have less resources and less access.

<p>This is a great point, and we would be happy to see you donate directly to any charity that helps those who are less fortunate or in need.  <i>Our thought process is this.. </i>To facilitate real change you have to change the <i>CULTURE</i> of society as a whole.  To share and enable a mind to what is possible, especially at a young age, can be the change that can do this.</p>
<p>For example: Your x-donation to y-charity may help temporarily, but changing the perspective of a young mind, and possibly an entire generation, through a collective creative effort can be a positive change for  a lifetime.  In addition bringing the conversation, whether online or in person, to the table about xyz-charity can expand the efforts and awareness of everyone connected around you.  So <i>10%</i> may seem like a modest piece of the pie, but we're looking at the big picture.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome, thank you for visiting us!​

We are glad to be sharing our campaign with you.   So let's get straight into the potatoes of what we're doing here.   As you might suspect by now.. we are making an animated cartoon series and we want to bring you along for the ride.  We are putting our efforts together to create the first episode (pilot episode).  We will use this along with concept art, story descriptions, and the campaign results to pitch to networks in hopes to create a full season for TV or Web.  We believe in this project and hope to have you on board too!
 
'Best Friends! With Fuzzy & Kazoo'

This is the story of 2 furry best friends who live on a Sanctuary Farm.  Where they spend their days making new friends and going on fantastic adventures.  They can go wherever their imagination takes them.  Through their encounters on the Farm they meet creatures in need of a new home who come from all walks of life, but there is one reoccurring trait we see.  Compassion, understanding, and a respect for everyone even if they are different or unfamiliar.  
 
What we have so far.. 

Story bible. check.   Pilot episode script. check  Strange voices. checkWeird, lovable, and hilarious characters. check check check.

Speaking of strange voices.  Here are some voice samples from the characters in our project. Enjoy a listen...

 
What we need...
It’s quite simple.  We are seeking Funding and an Audience.  We would be so grateful for any monetary support you can offer in our project and campaign.  If you would like to go far and beyond we would be happy if you would share our project and link with your family, friends and extended contacts.  Want to donate just $1, or any amount,  you can click 'Back It' and enter any number. 
How will the funds be used?... 

 
All money raised will go directly into production of our cartoon series as well as the campaign necessities outlined above.  This will allow us to hire the necessary artists and animators to create the cartoon series.  Donation to charities (explained below)... Plus studio space and other important production requirements, like coffee.  Lots and lots of coffee.  
Well, that didn't seem so complicated. Are you ready to open your hearts and wallets to our lofty project? Yes? Maybe? Hmmm...  should i tell you a bit more about the other aspects of the campaign first? 
 
Help us so we can help others.

Seems simple, but how does that work?  End of the day we want to create a kids cartoon series that takes us into a world all it's own.  With characters, imagination, adventures, and most importantly life lessons.  But, we realize we have a chance to do something bigger than put our creative ideas in stone.  At the end of the campaign we will donate 10% of all funds to various charities including but not limited to.. sanctuary farms, animal rescues, wildlife rehabilitation centers.   We will be transparent in this announcement post campaign and we think it will be a great opportunity to bring even more awareness to these facilities and their causes. 
How will you decide on what each charity gets?
We ask that You the donor state which charity group you'd like to sponsor. Simply write a comment after you support our campaign and which charity you choose.  If you can provide their social media link and/or government issued EIN # this would be appreciated.   If you can't decide or prefer, we can help direct your donation to various charities.  If you have a charity close to your heart that's outside of furry creatures, please do.  Kindness is kindness any way you give it.  
Need to find a charity's EIN#? Check here on the IRS site... https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/mainSearch.do;jsessionid=ZmL8lbddQW3ReXs01LZdeMaTRomdZl0BvtukP446.-?mainSearchChoice=pub78&dispatchMethod=selectSearch

 
Why don't I just donate directly to the charity to give them 100% of my gift?
This is a great point, and we would be happy to see you donate directly to any charity that helps those who are less fortunate or in need.  Our thought process is this.. To facilitate real change you have to change the CULTURE of society as a whole.  To share and enable a mind to what is possible, especially at a young age, can be the change that can do this.
For example: Your x-donation to y-charity may help temporarily, but changing the perspective of a young mind, and possibly an entire generation, through a collective creative effort can be a positive change for  a lifetime.  In addition bringing the conversation, whether online or in person, to the table about xyz-charity can expand the efforts and awareness of everyone connected around you.  So 10% may seem like a modest piece of the pie, but we're looking at the big picture.

Even Better.. We have many great production rewards.  Copies of the original pilot script, autographed art work from the creator, exclusive behind the scenes videos, and personalized voice memos from Fuzzy & Kazoo. These are just to name a few.
The WOW stuff... join in on a live google video chat, ask the creator questions about the story, production, or anything Best Friends! related.   Want to be invited to the early release, plus a meet and greet in person?  Join us for our live screening in nyc.  Want to help create a character for the show?  We're all ears.  These are just some of the super duper rewards for being a part of our project from day 1. 
In Addition... We also have more rewards in the works that will be announced later in the campaign.  They will be free additions or possible upgrades.  We haven't decided yet.  It's just so hard to keep things a secret!  Also look out for future SUPER rewards for our biggest SUPER-DUPER supporters and fans!


Creating positive change through the arts.
We understand the influence and power of visual arts.  We remember the tv shows, films, and childhood pop culture that shaped our youth minds.  Sure it may not define who you are today, but it most likely is a big part of your earliest memories. With this in mind, help us create a cartoon series that not only entertains, but brings fundamental values to the message of every episode.  Who said compassion, empathy, and acceptance can't be part of popular culture?  Whether your best friend is human or animal (or somewhere in-between), everyone could use a Fuzzy to their Kazoo. 

What happens to the funds if our goal isn't met?

This is a reality that we hope to avoid, but as with all creative fundraising, it's difficult to gauge the interest until the campaign has launched.  In the instance we do not meet our production funding goals, we can still move forward.  As planned, we will pitch the concept to potential networks.  If we are close, we will use our own funds to finish the pilot episode.  If it is a stretch and we fall flat in our fundraising we will do our best to create short scenes to show what our series is about.  Quality over quantity.  Every dollar counts and helps even if our goal isn't met. 
What if we exceed our fundraising goal?
Excellent!  We would be so ecstatic.  10% will still go to charity donation. While the remainder will go to future expenses of expanding our Best Friends! universe. Hiring additional writers, artists, voice over talent and animators to develop more episodes.  When the time comes Stretch Goals will be added.  We would love to independently create and release our own series.  This is what we DREAM of!

<h3><u>Who We Are:</u></h3>
<p>Little Engine Pictures is a great company and team who is passionate about showcasing issues that affect young adults today by creating content that brings the real-life scenarios into a fantasy world. Little Engine Pictures want to show that the issues that make people feel like outcasts are actually shared by plenty of people, and is more the norm than some may originally assume. We hope to create this new norm through its breakout hit ‘The Annex’. We plan to make the topics that are considered taboo in mainstream television into every episode and cover topics of mental health, sexuality, gender identity, race and diversity.<br/><br/>An extremely important aspect of television to us is representation. As content creators, we see the stereotypical straight white couples we, as a society, are constantly shining a spotlight on, and want more diversity. To us, it is extremely important that not only do we cover different controversial and uncomfortable for some topics but also that we have a representation of those topics constantly on our show.<br/><br/>The idea of authenticity is also important to us, which is why we will be making sure that we cast every person who plays an identity on screen is a person who actually identifies as that label in real life. We would never want to have a whitewashed cast or not accurately portray them. We never want to be offensive to our audience or not accurately represent them. That is why we are making sure our writers do research on identities of our characters that they might not identify with.  Overall, it is our goal to create content that every person can see themselves in, whether that be in terms of race, sexuality, gender, or mental illness, we want audiences to view our content and feel represented in an accurate and true way.<br/> </p> <h3><u>Story Synopsis:</u></h3>
<p>The Annex follows Samantha Cooper, a pansexual, depression and anxiety-ridden 19-year-old, small town girl trying to live out her dream. Desperate to make it as an actress, Sam leaves her small town and moves to Toronto. Sam provides the excitement and spontaneity of trying to follow a dream, with the hustle and bustle of big city living. Alone with limited funds and not that many friends; Sam posts an advertisement on Kijiji for two roommates.  Sam’s life turns upside down when she realizes her two new roommates have feelings for her, and she has feelings for both of them. Sam struggles as she navigates her new home, new city, mental health and love life.</p> <h3><u>Where The Funds Will Go:</u></h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kunmi Ogunsola. I'm a filmmaker based in Manchester, UK. My last project was a short film that I wrote and directed titled: Sunflower. It is a film that highlights the effects of positive affirmation and effective communication in families. The film was received very well at both our Manchester &amp; London screenings with a review by The Nubian Times. </p>
<p><strong><i>""From its contents to the beauty in its mis-en-scene, the short film is a must see"" - The Nubian Times</i></strong></p>
<p>I've always been interested in using my projects as an opportunity to dialogue about social issues. As my sophomore solo project, <strong>Millennials</strong> is a perfect mix of social commentary and entertainment.  This web series is the culmination of conversations i've had with a few of my friends reviewing the commonality and uniqueness in all our struggles as young adults in today's world. I created this show to reflect the shared experience of millennials: our triumphs and failures, our love and heartbreak, our collective desire for all round fulfilment and our rollercoaster journey to self discovery. I truly believe this show could be an outlet for many people, to see their varied idiosyncrasies reflected in the fictional characters I've created. </p>
<p>Contributing to this series would mean that you are joining me as co-creators for a show we can truly call ours.  A series that doesn't shy away from highlighting the socially sensitive, often marginalised topics such as mental illness, rape &amp; consent, race relations in the workplace, and a few others.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Funding </h3>
<p>We're looking to raise £3,000 and this will go towards the following:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Casting</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Set Design</li>
<li>Licences </li>
<li>Filming and Lighting Equipment Hire</li>
<li>Locations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Production </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Principle Photography</li>
<li>Sound Capture</li>
<li>Catering</li>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Public Liability Insurance </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post Production</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Sound Design</li>
<li>Sound Production</li>
<li>Colour Grading</li>
<li>Music/ Score</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Marketing </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Artwork / Graphic Design</li>
<li>Social Media Paid Advertisement</li>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Press Release</li>
<li>Press Junket </li>
<li>Cast Interviews</li>
<li>Cast Photoshoot</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced Screening</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Venue Hire</li>
<li>Videography</li>
<li>Refreshments</li>
<li>PA</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see there's a lot of work that goes into a production of this scale. Ideally our budget should be about £7 to £8,000 but Kunmi is very resourceful and will absorb a  lot of the costs.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Perks</h2>
<p>We have some fantastic perks associated with your contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>£5</strong>  you get social media shout out from us</li>
<li>
<strong>£10</strong> you get private exclusive online viewing of Sunflower, my short film. Its not out anywhere else</li>
<li>
<strong>£25 </strong>you get a signed <strong>poster</strong> from the cast</li>
<li>
<strong>£50</strong> you get to be an <strong>extra</strong> or put someone forth to be an extra</li>
<li>
<strong>£75</strong> you get a <strong>ticket</strong> to the Millennials Advanced Screening</li>
<li>
<strong>£100 </strong>you get a <strong>VIP ticket</strong> to the Millennials Advanced Screening with a private meet and greet &amp; photo opportunity with the cast</li>
<li>
<strong>£150</strong> You get your <strong>name in</strong> <strong>Credits </strong>as a sponsor</li>
<li>
<strong>£200</strong> You get to <strong>Name A Character</strong> in the series</li>
<li>
<strong>£250</strong> You get a <strong>Speaking Role </strong>in the series, or you could put someone forth.</li>
<li>
<strong>£500</strong> You get to become an <strong>Executive Producer</strong> of the show, joining the ranks of Weruche Opia herself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</strong></p>
<p>We would probably extend our production timeline to buy time to find other was of raising our goal budget. We would probably also make some changes to suit the actual budget we are able to raise. The show must go on! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>

My name is Kunmi Ogunsola. I'm a filmmaker based in Manchester, UK. My last project was a short film that I wrote and directed titled: Sunflower. It is a film that highlights the effects of positive affirmation and effective communication in families. The film was received very well at both our Manchester & London screenings with a review by The Nubian Times. 
""From its contents to the beauty in its mis-en-scene, the short film is a must see"" - The Nubian Times
I've always been interested in using my projects as an opportunity to dialogue about social issues. As my sophomore solo project, Millennials is a perfect mix of social commentary and entertainment.  This web series is the culmination of conversations i've had with a few of my friends reviewing the commonality and uniqueness in all our struggles as young adults in today's world. I created this show to reflect the shared experience of millennials: our triumphs and failures, our love and heartbreak, our collective desire for all round fulfilment and our rollercoaster journey to self discovery. I truly believe this show could be an outlet for many people, to see their varied idiosyncrasies reflected in the fictional characters I've created. 
Contributing to this series would mean that you are joining me as co-creators for a show we can truly call ours.  A series that doesn't shy away from highlighting the socially sensitive, often marginalised topics such as mental illness, rape & consent, race relations in the workplace, and a few others.
 

Why We Need Funding 
We're looking to raise £3,000 and this will go towards the following:
Pre-Production

Casting
Costumes
Set Design
Licences 
Filming and Lighting Equipment Hire
Locations

Production 

Principle Photography
Sound Capture
Catering
Transport
Public Liability Insurance 

Post Production

Editing
Sound Design
Sound Production
Colour Grading
Music/ Score

Marketing 

Artwork / Graphic Design
Social Media Paid Advertisement
Web Design
Press Release
Press Junket 
Cast Interviews
Cast Photoshoot

Advanced Screening

Venue Hire
Videography
Refreshments
PA

As you can see there's a lot of work that goes into a production of this scale. Ideally our budget should be about £7 to £8,000 but Kunmi is very resourceful and will absorb a  lot of the costs.
 
Perks
We have some fantastic perks associated with your contributions.

For £5  you get social media shout out from us

£10 you get private exclusive online viewing of Sunflower, my short film. Its not out anywhere else

£25 you get a signed poster from the cast

£50 you get to be an extra or put someone forth to be an extra

£75 you get a ticket to the Millennials Advanced Screening

£100 you get a VIP ticket to the Millennials Advanced Screening with a private meet and greet & photo opportunity with the cast

£150 You get your name in Credits as a sponsor

£200 You get to Name A Character in the series

£250 You get a Speaking Role in the series, or you could put someone forth.

£500 You get to become an Executive Producer of the show, joining the ranks of Weruche Opia herself

What happens if we don't reach our goal?
We would probably extend our production timeline to buy time to find other was of raising our goal budget. We would probably also make some changes to suit the actual budget we are able to raise. The show must go on! 
 

Your Impact
As mentioned earlier, the series looks to highlight some important issues, for instance mental illness, particularly within the black community. We believe film and television are platforms that spark conversation and change. We are already looking to partner with some charities and provide our viewers who might struggle with any of these issues with the charity's contact information. A helpline number could be the difference in saving someone's life.

Risks & Challenges
Some of the risks & challenges we anticipate include: not raising our goal budget, (where required) acquiring permits for locations to shoot, getting the right actors and crew, on-set accidents or damages to gear, etc. 
However, we believe we are tenacious and could be creative in solving some of these issue.

we've already explained our plan of action if we dont raise the goal budget
if we can't get permits, we'll become more resourceful and find free locations to shoot
Kunmi is going to be working with our actors to bring our their best on screen
We already budgeted for Employer's and Public Liability Insurance, should there be any accidents. Prevention is however better than cure, so we will cultivate a healthy and safe working set for all present.

<p>I grew up on Mad Magazine and Calvin &amp; Hobbes and Star Trek and the Simpsons and I learned that entertainment can reveal the human condition while also satirizing it and placing it in unfamiliar scenarios, because the truth shines through no matter the context it's put in. I grew up on music too, and I learned that the best way to get an emotional response is to write about things that evoke the strongest emotions in yourself. And when I grew up I saw shows like Girls and Master of None and I learned that TV is absolutely the best place to convey what life is REALLY like and the realities of being young in a world that has changed faster than at any point in history and yet is home to the realities that have been common to people throughout history. And then I got the opportunity to make a show of my own and I put all of that together and the best name for it was <i>peopleWatching</i>.</p>

<p>And I wrote a bunch of young characters who are all secretly half me and half fiction and who embody the kind of fundamental contradictions that we all have but are so often simplified in the shows we watch— characters like the musician who has fright everywhere except the stage, and the pervy feminist cool nerd, and the right-wing progressive girl, and the stripper with the 180 IQ who doesn't do it for the money, she just likes being naked in front of people even though she hates being objectified, and even if those characters aren't literally realistic they say something about the world in their descriptions.</p>
<p>And I tried to say something about what it's like to be a person by presenting those characters in self-contained stories that each explore a single idea using dialogue-heavy scenes that still find ways to be visually dynamic...</p>

<p>And I wrote an episode about how depression is like an entity that keeps tricking you into self-hatred because that's how it feels to me, and I wrote an episode about a guy struggling to write to his favorite teacher because that's what I was doing at the time, and I wrote an episode about a woman hoping there's some kind of scientifically derived afterlife in the future because she can't deal with all the tragedy and death in the world, and I wrote it because that was the way I felt all throughout 2016 and I needed to process those feelings and as an artist the best raw material to work with is whatever you feel strongest about. It's an infinitely deep well too—trying to explain what it's like to be a person is easily the world's longest conversation...</p>
<p>I also wrote an episode about a Non-Religious Confessional Booth where people confess their inner secrets and then discover that they're nowhere near as alone or different as they think they are, and I wrote it because to me that's what art IS—it's being yourself and then showing the world and then being stunned when a bunch of people put their hands up and say, “hey, me too!” All the better when you can do that using tight narratives with satisfying endings, and distinctive characters that give it all an emotional core, and the limitless potential of animation that allows for the kind of variety  that would otherwise be impossible.</p>

<p>Our show, Vivors, is about a community of people from different walks of life who have come together to tell their stories, to share their strength, hope, and belief that WE can change the future for the better.</p>
<p>Last year Vivors was scheduled to be part of Basilica Hudson’s NEA Grant, “Hudson As Muse,” but was canceled due to the Covid Pandemic. </p>

<p>Please help us realize our dream. The Hudson As Muse NEA Grant is not sufficient to cover our expenses and we need to raise additional funds. Our goal is to raise $5500 which will allow us to pay our cast and crew plus cover technical expenses for six weeks of virtual pre-production and one month of onsite filming in June.</p>
<p>Any donation amount is welcome. If you can't donate, you can still help us by spreading the word about our project. We thank you for your support. </p>

<p>The entire project will cost $40,000 USD, however, we are breaking up this project into smaller goals.

<p>Whether you come from the Caribbean and are dreaming of home, or are just a fan of great animation, we hope you will decide to help us on this ground-breaking project animated from Trinidad and Tobago!</p>
<p>Support this project and choose the reward you desire. We have rewards in various tiers, which will include early access to the episode on Youtube, high quality download links for the episode, access to preliminary production material, associate producers’ credits and Skype chats with the production crew!</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Kevin Bhall and I’m the lead animator from Scraps Animation in Trinidad. We’re working on an animated web series called Scraps! 
Scraps is a lavishly animated and illustrated web-series featuring endearing kid-friendly characters and uniquely Caribbean settings.
                               It stars the titular character, Scraps, a lovable scamp of a stray cat who lives in the fish market of a coastal Caribbean village, and the exciting adventures (and misadventures) he has with the inhabitants there, both human and animal.

<p>The reason I'm creating this series is because of the serious lack of accurate, relatable, or open representation of asexuality in media, and especially for people of color. In general, there's also just a huge question mark that still floats overhead the topic of asexuality, which demands the spread of awareness. So this series is here to continue that dialogue and to help people understand what asexuality is, how we view the world, and to understand that each person's experience as an asexual (or someone sitting on the spectrum) varies from one person to the next. Overall,  it is a show that will not only further the already lacking visibility of asexual characters in mainstream media, but highlight other sexual and romantic spectrums that are often not discussed candidly. </p>
<p>The show revolves around two women who come from very different walks of life, and have different perspectives, yet at the same time are so similar in the way that they have to face societies judgments for their lack of sexuality or hypersexualitiy. As women, and especially women of color coming from very traditional cultures there are certain roles and ways of behaving and looking that they’re expected to adhere to. But just like many of the modern women of today, they break away from those expectation and allow themselves to experience continuous growth as they enter new stages of life and self-realization.</p>

<p>The majority of the funds will be spent on paying our actors, locations, food &amp; craft services, and even travel expenses for some of out cast who are commuting from out of state. But the budget doesn’t stop there! We also need the funds to secure equipment that we don’t already have access to, wardrobe, and POSSIBLY even post-production so that we can ensure we can provide you the best possible quality sound design and music! Overall, literally EVERY penny helps in trying to provide the best possible show for you guys on a small budget. </p>

<p>Our cast and crew are filled with diverse people who are INCREDIBLY talented women,  people of color, and LGBTQA individuals. For the sake of authenticity and representation I’ve always believed it’s important to tell stories and create teams and cast that can personally identify with the story being told in some aspect or another.  </p>

<strong>Maya</strong> (Khiana Sizemore) <p>is an asexual who’s straightforward and sassy. However, as she has to deal with the persistent societal pressures to date and be sexually active she finds it harder and harder to be comfortable in her own skin. At times, it seems the only place she can be herself is online, or with her friends, but, when she’s not busy building up her online social presence, she’s working as an intern for a small production house.  </p>

<p><strong>Jasmine</strong> is an incredibly strong, independent, woman who – quite literally – “don’t need no man”. She’s an aromantic sex-positive pansexual who is a programmer by day and a writer by night. Not the type for commitment, she’s a woman who boldly embraces the freedom to express her own sexuality whenever and with whomever she pleases – carrying herself with confidence and allure, often against criticism from her family and the unwelcome opinions of men.   </p>
<p><strong>Jared </strong>(Andrew Reid) is Maya’s closest guy friend, who she meets at an asexual meetup. He doesn’t necessarily like labels but he identifies as queer. Overall, Jared is a chill free-spirit who brings out the sort of geeky enthusiastic side in Maya when they bond over common interests.   </p>

</div></div>","The reason I'm creating this series is because of the serious lack of accurate, relatable, or open representation of asexuality in media, and especially for people of color. In general, there's also just a huge question mark that still floats overhead the topic of asexuality, which demands the spread of awareness. So this series is here to continue that dialogue and to help people understand what asexuality is, how we view the world, and to understand that each person's experience as an asexual (or someone sitting on the spectrum) varies from one person to the next. Overall,  it is a show that will not only further the already lacking visibility of asexual characters in mainstream media, but highlight other sexual and romantic spectrums that are often not discussed candidly. 
The show revolves around two women who come from very different walks of life, and have different perspectives, yet at the same time are so similar in the way that they have to face societies judgments for their lack of sexuality or hypersexualitiy. As women, and especially women of color coming from very traditional cultures there are certain roles and ways of behaving and looking that they’re expected to adhere to. But just like many of the modern women of today, they break away from those expectation and allow themselves to experience continuous growth as they enter new stages of life and self-realization.
 


The majority of the funds will be spent on paying our actors, locations, food & craft services, and even travel expenses for some of out cast who are commuting from out of state. But the budget doesn’t stop there! We also need the funds to secure equipment that we don’t already have access to, wardrobe, and POSSIBLY even post-production so that we can ensure we can provide you the best possible quality sound design and music! Overall, literally EVERY penny helps in trying to provide the best possible show for you guys on a small budget. 

 

Besides receiving the opportunity to support underprivileged and unrepresented voices and stories, you will get my enthusiastic and overwhelming GRATITUDE, merch merch merch (more perks to come), first and/or bts access, credits, the opportunity to CREATE……A CHARACTER (how cool is that), and of course be an amazing awesome producer of the web series who will get to come to the premiere! 

 

Our cast and crew are filled with diverse people who are INCREDIBLY talented women,  people of color, and LGBTQA individuals. For the sake of authenticity and representation I’ve always believed it’s important to tell stories and create teams and cast that can personally identify with the story being told in some aspect or another.

C A S T

Maya (Khiana Sizemore) is an asexual who’s straightforward and sassy. However, as she has to deal with the persistent societal pressures to date and be sexually active she finds it harder and harder to be comfortable in her own skin. At times, it seems the only place she can be herself is online, or with her friends, but, when she’s not busy building up her online social presence, she’s working as an intern for a small production house.  


Jasmine is an incredibly strong, independent, woman who – quite literally – “don’t need no man”. She’s an aromantic sex-positive pansexual who is a programmer by day and a writer by night. Not the type for commitment, she’s a woman who boldly embraces the freedom to express her own sexuality whenever and with whomever she pleases – carrying herself with confidence and allure, often against criticism from her family and the unwelcome opinions of men.   
Jared (Andrew Reid) is Maya’s closest guy friend, who she meets at an asexual meetup. He doesn’t necessarily like labels but he identifies as queer. Overall, Jared is a chill free-spirit who brings out the sort of geeky enthusiastic side in Maya when they bond over common interests.   

 
 

As with everything in life there will be risks and challenges that we face in the creation of this project. We’re shooting most of it in the winter so….❄️Brrrrr❄️. We expect to face unpredictable weather conditions, and potential shifts in shooting schedules. But we’re fully prepared and equipped to take on these possible challenges and will make sure you guys get to enjoy the experience of watching this show by the end of 2018!
 


I am so very thankful for all forms of contribution you decide to make, whether it’s by donating, spreading the word, etc. Whatever it is. Thank. You. For all your support! 
And if you want to think of other ways you can support other than by donation, and you happen to be incredibly gifted in something or want to offer some form of in kind service we’d be so so so grateful and welcome you to reach out to us at idgafwebseries@gmail.com .

<p>Hi! My name is Becca Beberaggi and I am a NYC based writer, actress, and comedian. I'm so happy to announce that I will be shooting a 5 part series called ""B-Sides"" this winter, co- directed by Jonah Levine! The story centers around a native New Yorker named B (No relation to me at all!) as she takes on day to day life in Brooklyn, NY. You might ask ""Becca, why should I care about that?"" and I would reply, ""I don't know. I can't read minds"" but I will say this. All my life I have desperately wanted to tell stories through my lens as a woman of color and share them with you! I have always used the phrases like ""I want to be the female version of so and so"" or ""I want to be the brown version of this successful white person"". I hate these phrases and I'm ready to just tell the stories I'm dying to tell. For example: Ever cried so hard you got your period? Me too. Ever been talked at and not talked to. Me too. Every wanted your life to be a silent film? Me too! </p>
<p>I have finally found an awesome team to help me bring these dumb ideas come to life! AlI I need is a little bit of help so that I can pay everyone for their hard work. This includes food, location rentals, more food, coffee, food, and last but not least funds to pay my incredible crew and actors. </p>
<p>I promise to make you laugh and I'll try not to make you uncomfortable, regardless I hope you join me :)</p>

</div></div>","A second series!?
YES! The characters of Forward Slash/Jobs (the entire Series One can be seen for FREE on Amazon Prime here) are back by popular demand for a brand new adventure at Maxus and Berns in another six episodes of awkward, British comedy!
Professionalism on Set
Professional interviewer Joseph Pecker (Murphy Rhodes) finds himself out of work and out of luck as we follow his attempts to get his life back on track and his office back from Robert Hampton (Andrew Games), the new resident interviewer. Everyone's favourite cleaner/receptionist combo of Glenn James (James Kemp) and Jane Melia (Laura Cotter) return, too, along with delivery guy Hermes (Leonidas Pan) and the hand puppet fella Mr. Broonshoon with Mr. Flizzy (Sean Bradshaw and Sean Bradshaw's hand respectively) - but there's new faces, too.
Trying to catch Glenn's nose while he's staring into space.
The series has been completely filmed from start to finish, but in typical Murphy Rhodes style, he's paid for the whole thing with his bank overdraft. And he needs your help!
We don't know who's copying who any more.
Full transparency, here's a breakdown of the costs:

Crew expenses (travel from North Wales to Liverpool and back over six days + travel between stations in Liverpool): £141.30
Printing costs (callsheets, script excerpts, posters, photographs for set): £16.30
Canva subscription for two months (poster creation, all graphic design needs, social media covers/images): £22.00
Props (1 x pack of five cigars = £6.15, 2 x pints of lager = £7.60, 1 x pack of 50 envelopes = £4.99, 1 x First class stamp = £0.70, 2 x Belts - £5.00, 2 x red bic pens = £1.58, 1 x Memo block of post-it notes = £3.99, 1 x Clipboard = £3.49, 1 x pack of white chalk = £1.49, 1 x Portfolio = £3.49, 1 x Door name plate = £8.15, 1 x Desk name plate = £5.60, 1 x Pair of Sunglasses = £4.39): £56.62
Refreshments on set (tea/coffee, snacks, milk for six days filming and with us using as little as possible): £25.22
Social media marketing (we want as many eyes to see our hard work as possible, and sometimes you have to pay for people to look! This will be mostly Facebook ads, but not limited to): £100
Premiere Night in Liverpool (we don't expect you to pay for our drinks, but the cast and crew will all be invited to watch the final series in a small venue in the centre of Liverpool before the series is released. It's a reward for all of their hard work, and this amount just covers the cost of the venue hire): £50.00
Indiegogo Charge for Transacting in GBP: £25

This all comes to £436.44, but with the fees that indiegogo attach and the processing fees per transaction (they take a percentage of whatever we earn), we've put our goal up to £500.
We just wanted to prove we were filming this in Liverpool. Still managed to miss the Liver Birds by about an inch.
The series release date is set as 1st November 2019, so only a couple of months until you can watch, what we consider to be, a second series that's 1000 times superior to it's predecessor!
If you can't donate, you can help in other ways! Either give this project a share on your Facebook, Twitter or whatever social media you find yourself on (don't know what the kids are using these days. Is Habbo still a thing?). You can also give our pages a like:

The scene we shot where the girl was half plant. Sort of a low budget Poison Ivy. The character, not the species of flora.

<h3>On The Fringe</h3>
<p>With the rise in access to information through the internet, we've seen a rise in awareness about the vast number of communities and identities that exist different from our own. Unfortunately, much of the screen time given to these communities is created with the members as the butt of a joke. Whether that's depicting Furries as deranged sex maniacs, or stereotyping Adult Babies as weird dudes who can't find girlfriends, much of this content is created with the intent to entertain through <u>laughing at</u> those who are different from ourselves.</p>
<p>As a member of the LGBTQ community myself, I've seen firsthand how harmful this type of stereotyping and ""othering"" can be to someone who already feels that they are different from the norm.</p>
<p>The goal of this series is to create entertaining and educational content, without making a spectacle of those living alternative lifestyles. In each episode, I will not only sit down and interview members of various fringe communities and identities, but spend time in each community, doing my best to literally walk a day in their shoes. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This is my first full production docuseries, a project larger than anything I have undertaken before, and I want to do it well. That's why I need your support. I am so excited to be able to hire an incredible crew (videographer, editor, production assistant), but it is a lot to take on financially.</p>
<p>Even so, I think that these fringe communities deserve fair representation, and that this series will help those who feel different or ""not enough"". And of course, as with all my content, I want to create something that brings people together through entertainment and laughter!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I plan to create 6 episodes for this first season, and have estimated a budget of $1200 per episode. I've added $300 to give room to fulfill rewards, and that's where the goal of $7500 comes from!</p>
<p>Here's how the money will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring and paying a videographer</li>
<li>Hiring and paying an editor</li>
<li>Hiring and paying a production assistant (*hopefully*)</li>
<li>Paying for travel costs</li>
<li>Funding in-video props and equipment</li>
<li>Designing series branding</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of the neat perks you can get your hands on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive behind-the-scenes content</li>
<li>Be the first to receive On The Fringe merch - signed!</li>
<li>Get your name in the official credits</li>
<li>Know that you are supporting an independent creator wanting to use her platform to spread some awareness</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute financially, there are other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign to your social media. The more eyes we get on it, the more likely we are to reach our goal! Indiegogo has some great sharing tools to make this easy.</li>
<li>Follow me on Instagram to stay up to date on this project!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><p>I want to say thank you up front for all your support. I can't wait to get started on creating this thing!</p></div>","On The Fringe

Even so, I think that these fringe communities deserve fair representation, and that this series will help those who feel different or ""not enough"". And of course, as with all my content, I want to create something that brings people together through entertainment and laughter!
 

What We Need & What You Get
I plan to create 6 episodes for this first season, and have estimated a budget of $1200 per episode. I've added $300 to give room to fulfill rewards, and that's where the goal of $7500 comes from!
Here's how the money will be used:

Hiring and paying a videographer
Hiring and paying an editor
Hiring and paying a production assistant (*hopefully*)
Paying for travel costs
Funding in-video props and equipment
Designing series branding

 
Some of the neat perks you can get your hands on:

Exclusive behind-the-scenes content
Be the first to receive On The Fringe merch - signed!
Get your name in the official credits
Know that you are supporting an independent creator wanting to use her platform to spread some awareness

 
Other Ways You Can Help

If you aren't able to contribute financially, there are other ways you can help:

Share this campaign to your social media. The more eyes we get on it, the more likely we are to reach our goal! Indiegogo has some great sharing tools to make this easy.
Follow me on Instagram to stay up to date on this project!

 
I want to say thank you up front for all your support. I can't wait to get started on creating this thing!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This series celebrates everything about the black culture; from the African society to the thoughts and frustrations of Black Americans. It explores the history of slavery and racism, the power and beauty of black people and the preservation of their identity. For instance, our lead character, HELEN, comes from a long line of BLACK DRUIDS who were once slaves of the Lockharts (a very notorious family of vampires and witches). Today in ""post racial America"", the tensions between these supernatural factions still exists, creating a conflict between a white supernatural world, and a supernatural world of colour. </p>
<p>To have a BLACK FEMALE lead and a majority black cast in a young adult fantasy will be ground breaking. Helen's story is more than just her being in love with the son of her former master, it is representative of the messy and complex vision of black womanhood. It is our hope that EVERY black woman out there will see their lives reflected back at them. through Helen; her frustrations of a lifetime of discrimination from the Lockhart Vampires, which has resulted in subconscious self loathing. These frustrations and insecurities appear in many forms such as straightening and bleaching her hair blonde in order to fit into today's ""beauty standards"".</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need extra money?</h3>
<p>Working with practical effects, stunts, period settings etc takes a big jump. We made a trailer with absolutely no budget (for a student project), it turned out okay. This time, we sat down, and discussed how we can improve our craft. Because if we are going to tell this deep and personal story, we have to do it right. But doing it right means more money (to hire experienced crew and good gear), but unfortunately, this isn't realistic for the budget we have. So this is why we need your help. Anything that you can give and/or do will be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>All funds raised will go towards completing production, post production and every other expense incurred during the production of this series. </p>
<p>Here's what your funds will cover:</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCTION:</strong> Experienced cast and crew, equipment rentals (lighting, cameras, sound, vans, stunt equipment, insurance, medics, locations and period props).</p>
<p><strong>POST PRODUCTION: </strong>Editing and visual effects.</p>
<p><strong>The series will be available on youtube for everyone to watch.</strong> <strong>NO PROFIT will be made from the series.</strong></p>
<p>Everyone who donates will receive updates and production information. We will be giving away some of the props used during filming i.e. period clothing (that we don't need anymore), daggers and stakes, grimoires, posters,  jewellery and so much more!</p>

<h3>WHO am I and WHY this project</h3>
<p>My name is Ina and I am the writer/director of ""Homies,"" a web series project. I've been a filmmaker and a TV production professional for about 4 years.</p>
<p>Last year, I began to visualize a web series. One that would explore different experiences of relationships that my friends and I have come to experience - with people who looked like us.</p>
<p>As a Filipino immigrant and a queer woman, I wanted to create stories that feature Filipino queer women - ones that I rarely see in media. I also wanted to give a stage to others who are people of color and in the lgbtq+ spectrum. Many times these groups are portrayed by their struggles: their coming out stories and their stories of oppression. While these are important experiences, the media ignores other aspects of their lives - ones that end up being told by people who look and act nothing like them.</p>
<p>The Homies web series aims to normalize our stories within society.</p>
<h3>WHAT is Homies</h3>
<p>""Homies"" will be a web series of 4-stand-alone episodes. (Maybe more if things go well) Each episode has different characters and has a different theme, all featuring queer-identifying people and people of color. </p>
<p><u>Brief Description</u></p>
<p>1st EP: Two best friends navigate their friends-with-benefits relationship</p>
<p>2nd EP: A couple enjoys their last day before a long-distance relationship</p>
<p>3rd EP: A homeless couple tries to get clean and get off the streets together</p>
<p>4th EP: A middle-aged couple look back on the start of their relationship</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHEN do you see the product</h3>
<p>The FIRST EPISODE has already been produced and is being submitted to film festivals this year. It has already been included in a few film festivals!</p>
<p>Our aim is to produce the next three episodes early next year with a Summer release. We want to take the rest of the year to raise our goal of $10,000.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHERE does the money go towards</h3>
<p>The Cast and Crew! Everything is about them!! We want to pay everyone for their hard work and we want to make sure they have enough to eat. Equipment rentals and location fees are the least of our worries. </p>
<p>(For the 1st episode, the cast and crew worked pro bono and that production still cost me $2,000! )</p>
</div><div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Concord Pictures, currently entering our last year at Ryerson University. </p>
<p>Our team consists of Victoria Salituro (Producer), Connor Martin (Director), Chloe Hazard (Assistant Director), Alexandru Titu (D.O.P), Sarah Hurst (Marketing Lead) and Jayda Mangat (Social Media Lead). </p>
<p>""Faces of Resilience"" is a passion project created by our director Connor Martin who is Six Nations of the Grand River, from the Mohawk Nation and a member of the Bear clan. </p>
<p>Each Episode of ""Faces of Resilience"" will follow the story of a successful Indigenous leader and how their background, family, and community contributed to their path. This project is incredibly important to us because we see the lack of representation for successful Indigenous people and the abundance of negative representation there is. </p>
<p>Our goal is to inspire and lift the spirits of Indigenous youth by showing them Indigenous figures to look up to and to see what each and every one of them is capable of. </p>
<p>If we are able to achieve our goal of $7000, it is our mission to execute ""Faces of Resilience"" in the most true and authentic way possible; as well as reach as many Indigenous youths as possible. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding goal is $7000. </p>
<p>This funding will go towards rental equipment, travel expenses, editing softwares, as well as food for our crew. </p>
<p>For our incredible donors, we have some amazing perks! These Include; a limited ""Faces of Resilience"" sticker for donations of $30+, tickets to our premiere event for donations of $50+, free downloadable versions of the docu-series for donations of $80+ and lastly YOUR name in the credits for donations of $120+. </p>
<p>If we are unsuccessful in reaching our funding goal of $7000, all of the funds which we are able to raise will still go towards this project. It is our goal to make this happen and we will continue to crowdfund until we can. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will be made possible by each and every individual who contributes to this campaign. </p>
<p>""Faces of Resilience"" is a valuable series because of the message it conveys. The message of hope, perseverance, and determination. All qualities which are not only valuable to Indigenous youth, but everybody. </p>
<p>Our director, Connor Martin, has experience working for the ""Creative Native"" and has first-hand experience working with Indigenous youth. Additionally, our Director of Photography, Alexandru has had years of experience filming projects of this calibre- so we can also guarantee that ""Faces of Resilience"" won't just have incredible stories- but incredibly beautiful cinematography to match.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Executing a docu-series of this magnitude will come with its challenges. We are planning to work with three separate individuals who come from completely different upbringings, which means several locations to film at. </p>
<p>We are fully prepared to make decisions about these filming locations and other obstacles that will be thrown in our direction. If need be, we have back-up locations for our interviews and footage. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Lifties is an indie comedy web series and the first of its kind to originate from the Midwest. The series follows the crew of Mt. Schole, Minnesota as they struggle through the ski season and deal with a shell shocked head of ski patrol, a soulless city council bureaucrat, and the occasional moose encounter. There are currently three episodes available for free streaming online.  </p>
<p>In order to continue the series, donations from viewers and sponsors are vital! The series has the potential to become the next Letterkenny, Trailer Park Boys...but it needs support to make it as great as it can possibly be. </p>
<p>We are asking for your support to help create the first-ever viral live-action web series to come from the Midwest! Help us revitalize snowboard/alpine culture and showcase the creative talent that our region has to offer, and finally to prove that the best creations don't have to come from a studio lot in Los Angeles. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our current goal to produce the rest of Lifties Season 1 is a minimum of $500.  Your contribution will go towards funding the production and nothing else. </p>
<p>We are currently offering Lifties merchandise including custom travel mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and hats as perks for your support.</p>
<p>The creators of the series are not taking a paycheck. Even if we are unable to reach the $500 goal we will use what we do raise to help offset the costs of production. Your money will go towards hiring crew members and cast, catering for the production, equipment, and licensing, merchendise, and advertisement. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In order for us to elevate the series to the professional quality it deserves, we need your financial support. Your donation will go towards creating something that has never been done before in the Midwest or snowboard industry. </p>
<p>Our first two episodes were made on almost a zero-dollar budget with most of the costs being paid out of pocket by the creators themselves. If we can accomplish that with almost nothing just imagine what we can do with your help!</p>
<p>We are not wealthy, trust-fund creatives, we are ordinary people with a passion for art and storytelling. Help us tell our story and the story of midwest snowboarding!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that COVID-19 has made things financially difficult for everyone this year.  Running a production during uncertain times presents a lot of unique challenges, but we are well tasked to mitigate these risks with safe, COVID conscious sets, and a tight budget to ensure not a cent of your donation is wasted. </p>
<p>Our production team includes experienced filmmakers who have handled far greater amounts of money on feature-length projects. Your donation is in good hands. If you are interested in learning more about our budget breakdown and how the money you donate will be used feel free to reach out!</p>

Our current goal to produce the rest of Lifties Season 1 is a minimum of $500.  Your contribution will go towards funding the production and nothing else. 
We are currently offering Lifties merchandise including custom travel mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and hats as perks for your support.
The creators of the series are not taking a paycheck. Even if we are unable to reach the $500 goal we will use what we do raise to help offset the costs of production. Your money will go towards hiring crew members and cast, catering for the production, equipment, and licensing, merchendise, and advertisement. 

The Impact
In order for us to elevate the series to the professional quality it deserves, we need your financial support. Your donation will go towards creating something that has never been done before in the Midwest or snowboard industry. 
Our first two episodes were made on almost a zero-dollar budget with most of the costs being paid out of pocket by the creators themselves. If we can accomplish that with almost nothing just imagine what we can do with your help!
We are not wealthy, trust-fund creatives, we are ordinary people with a passion for art and storytelling. Help us tell our story and the story of midwest snowboarding!

Risks & Challenges
We understand that COVID-19 has made things financially difficult for everyone this year.  Running a production during uncertain times presents a lot of unique challenges, but we are well tasked to mitigate these risks with safe, COVID conscious sets, and a tight budget to ensure not a cent of your donation is wasted. 
Our production team includes experienced filmmakers who have handled far greater amounts of money on feature-length projects. Your donation is in good hands. If you are interested in learning more about our budget breakdown and how the money you donate will be used feel free to reach out!

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Conservative Indian patriarch Amol Tyagi allows college friend Akash Malhotra and his family to stay for a few days at his house before they move across the country. The two families find themselves at odds due to their conflicting worldviews, all the more complicated by an inconvenient secret Akash is hiding. </span></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Story</span></h3>
<h3><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">In the 90s, there was <i>Friends</i> and <i>Seinfeld</i>. More recently, there was <i>The Office</i>. And they were all... amazing. </span></font></h3>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">Not simply because they were funny, but because they related to a particular tone that everyone had towards their daily lives. Friends was for the feel-good crowd while Seinfeld was for the sarcastic- regardless, we all had a Joey, Ross, Rachel, George, and sometimes even, a Kramer in our lives. </span></font></p>
<p>What about the Indians? Where was the show like that for them?</p>
<p>To be honest, it's not a question many of us even considered. Why would we? We had Bollywood, with its larger than life heroes, and the feel-good drama that they brought to our families.</p>
<p>Plus, who ever heard of an Indian sitcom? ""First focus on studies. Your grades- that is real joke.""</p>

Conservative Indian patriarch Amol Tyagi allows college friend Akash Malhotra and his family to stay for a few days at his house before they move across the country. The two families find themselves at odds due to their conflicting worldviews, all the more complicated by an inconvenient secret Akash is hiding. 
 

Our Story
In the 90s, there was Friends and Seinfeld. More recently, there was The Office. And they were all... amazing. 
Not simply because they were funny, but because they related to a particular tone that everyone had towards their daily lives. Friends was for the feel-good crowd while Seinfeld was for the sarcastic- regardless, we all had a Joey, Ross, Rachel, George, and sometimes even, a Kramer in our lives. 
What about the Indians? Where was the show like that for them?
To be honest, it's not a question many of us even considered. Why would we? We had Bollywood, with its larger than life heroes, and the feel-good drama that they brought to our families.
Plus, who ever heard of an Indian sitcom? ""First focus on studies. Your grades- that is real joke.""
Everyone's likely heard the occasional roast from their parents, the judgmental vibe a family friend gave when they did something remotely  ""controversial"", and faced the stresses it means to be an Indian-American growing up today. In fact, we have a meme group dedicated to this shared experience - Subtle Curry Traits -The Facebook Group. 
So when a family friend asked us, ""Why don't you make an Indian sitcom"", the question was baffling. We laugh at everything our community says and thus, and nonetheless we embrace it. But a public comedy? What would our parents say?? Would they let us watch this ""garbage""? 
That's when it hit, we had to make this show. We had to take this shared experience we have, and show the most honest portrayal of it, one where no one had a filter. They were just being themselves, living their daily lives, being the memes they are and experience. Because they're us. And we're them. 
The Office meets an Indian-American household. The satire our community needs. For the demand that definitely exists.

<h3>Who I Am &amp; Why Am I So Passionate About Recovery Unplugged!</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Amy Leigh McCorkle, an award winning, bestselling author, blogger, screenwriter and filmmaker. I have published 27 books, 3 of them non-fiction detailing my journey from diagnosis with bipolar to 11x Amazon Bestseller, including the international bestselling memoir Letters to Daniel. The award nominated Something to Believe In (a part how to/part memoir on how to thrive creatively while coping with serious mental illness). And the behind to scenes memoir on the Making of Letters to Daniel, the feature film adapted from the memoir of the same name.</p>
<p>In 2014 my producing partner and I established Healing Hands Entertainment. Since then we have written 34+ award winning scripts and 23 award winning films, including Letters to Daniel, which I directed.</p>
<p>Recovery Unplugged is an extension of that film's legacy about and on my life. Recovery Unplugged seeks to demystify and destigmatize mental illness by interviewing celebrities and putting a recognizable face to it. And recognizing independent artists who are beating the odds and succeeding, and providing them with a leg up in their chosen field. Be it filmmaking, acting, publishing, screenwriting, ect.</p>
<p>Everyone at Healing Hands Entertainment believes in order to change the landscape of mental health awareness you have to be willing to think outside the box and we and the rest of the team believe Recovery Unplugged is just the way to do it! This is a highly personal project to me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 21 years ago and although the journey was arduous, my strongest purpose in life is to shine a light for others struggling to let them know they are not alone. And that there is hope, there is healing, and that there is recovery.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to film this pilot and make it the most beautiful and effective that it can we've broken the budget down to $3,000. That will cover the basics, such as sound cards, video cards, the need to rent some lighting equipment, transportation and housing costs, location costs, crew payment, wardrobe, make-up, and catering and the editor. It all goes towards making the show as impactful as it can be.</p>
<p>That's what we get. What do you get you ask?</p>
<p>Some of the awesome perks include a shoutout on social media. Sponsorship, you make a set donation and you and your project get a plug DURING the pilot episode! Another perk, a special thank credit at the end of the show! And there's even a perk to be a guest on the show should the show get picked-up by a network for distribution! Not to mention an IMBD co-producer credit which will get you a private zoom screening with the producer, director, and stars of Letters to Daniel!</p>
<p>ALL FUNDS go directly to the production of the television pilot. This show WILL tape, God and corona willing in February 2021. And a private zoom screening of the finished product will held for ALL donors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Recovery Unplugged is important to me because it allows me to give back a community that has given me so much over the past 21 years. The mental health community has provided me with proper treatment (albeit after a rocky start) and support as I grew into my stability. I feel it is important to the world, is because though people are more open now there is still a tremendous amount of stigma in this world and it keeps the people who need it from getting help. A show like this would let them know they are not alone and would let them know where to get help.</p>
<p>As I've mentioned I've directed 23 films. With Black Gold, Letters to Daniel:Breakdown to Bestseller, Something to Believe In and Broken all receiving distribution. The Letters to Daniel feature film is being screened for distributors, investors, and producers, in September and already has an offer of distribution from ParablesTV.</p>
<p>1 in 5 people will be diagnosed with a mental health crisis in their lifetime. Close to 50 million people are currently diagnosed with a serious mental illness in the United States. A show like this is needed to not only open up the dialogue on mental health further, but to start to create change in how we address the mentally ill population as a whole.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Shooting and launching a TV Talk Show takes money, time, and connections. You usually  need a platform. And usually when people think of platforms people think of Kelly Ripa, Kelly Clarkson, Oprah Winfrey, Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz.</p>
<p>Since 2013 Letters to Daniel has been a popular blog, a bestselling memoir, an award winning documentary, spawned a behind the scenes memoir, as well as an award nominated how to memoir, and award winning feature film. Recovery Unplugged continues in that legacy and I am uniquely qualified to do it because of my successful recovery journey which includes a successful career which started in February of 2011. Since which I have won 111 awards across my body of work.</p>
<p>I plan on tackling the above challenges by utilizing my skills for making the most of a microbudget. Assembling a crack team of producers, crew, and post production team by drawing from amazing pool of filmmaker friends I have amassed during my career.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't give monetarily, I encourage you to vocally support the Recover Unplugged mission by using the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

By Sonya Jenkins</p><p>With the Coronavirus Pandemic shutting down the film industry for a while and many actors not knowing when they'd work again, I wanted to continue bringing forth creative content that afforded actors a chance to showcase their talent, even when they were social distancing. I also wanted to continue with my first filmmaking initiative - ""Shayla's Catch"" film project - and celebrate our 1-year Anniversary on Amazon Prime Video., Sharing the backstory of ""Shayla's Catch"" seemed like the best option for me to continue creating, so within weeks of getting the idea to relaunch the ""Shayla's Catch"" initiative (with prequels), I successfully birthed my first self-taped web series. ""Before The Catch"" was released via YouTube (via Sonya's Spotlight) and FilmFreeway.com October 15, 2020. Each actor in ""Before The Catch"" was responsible for self-taping their own scene and given a deadline to send the director their scene back - approximately one week. I only provided the actors with sides (script) and a few details. Hence, 10 out of 13 actors I approached got their scenes back to me within a few days, and ""Shayla's Catch Prequel"" was born - ""Before The Catch."" On November 16 ""Shayla's Catch Prequel"" premiered on Amazpm Prime Video. You can check out the first episode here:  <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Catching-Feelings/dp/B08NL83PY6/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/Catching-Feelings/dp/B08...</a>.</p><p>Synopsis:</p><p> ""Before The Catch,"" the melodrama prequel to ""Shayla's Catch"" film, introduces viewers to the lifestyle of Calvin CK Moore, a wealthy NFL star wide receiver, played by Oshea Russell. The football journey and the intimate life of CK Moore is lavish and complicated. He often brags, ""The more they see me, the more they want me,"" but is put to the test as he juggles multiple women, who all claim him as their man. CK's main girl, Mia Falana, played by Amina Buddafly,  has to come to terms with whether she should hang on to her playboy boyfriend or give him a dose of his own medicine. The story presents many questions about faithfulness and loyalty - even down to CK's cousin Dexter Moore (Isaiah Lucas) who always watches out for (and sometimes lies for) his popular football star cousin, CK. ""Before The Catch"" also introduces Shayla Lucas (played by Kyleigh Campbell in the prequel) who is seeking an ultimate catch.  In ""Before The Catch"" viewers will also meet lovebirds, Steve and Tacara, Shayla's mom, Connie, Shayla's aunt Sydney, Deidra (a designer who owns her own boutique), Epiphany (an NFL owner's daughter), and her soon-to-be mentor, Claire Jones (played by me), who often advises her son, Diego Jones, in his own relationship dilemmas. The ""Before The Catch"" prequels will be less than 20 minute each - giving glimpses into the lives of each character - leading up to ""Shayla's Catch.""</p><p> </p><p>Director's Statement:</p><p>The process of preparing for ""Shayla's Catch,"" the film, began before it even became a book, but when my nephew, a former college football player at Arizona State University, had a football game in Los Angeles against the USC Trojans in 2018, I scheduled a Table Read the next day. It went so well, that I had actors calling me to be a part of the project. I scheduled another Table Read and knew exactly who I should choose as Lead and Supporting actors. My first Shayla in ""Shayla's Catch"" is the daughter of Super Bowl Champion and former Wider Receiver of the Chicago Bears and L.A. Raiders (and the fastest man in the world in his age group) Willie Gault. I knew that Shakari Gault would be a good fit for the role of Shayla based on her acting ability (I had viewed some of her work), her knowledge about the football life and her beauty. </p><p><br/>The two tables reads and auditions, and my already promoting SHAYLA'S CATCH (the novel), garnered so much attention that people began texting and calling me (out of the blue) to ask if they could be a part of the project. Many offered something in return - their location (if they weren't actors) or wardrobe. But my actors auditioned for and earned their roles. </p><p>I am so proud of my cast and the way we all came together. If I didn't choose them through an audition, I saw their work in film projects or on stage. I also took referrals. In short, I have the best cast I could ever dream of having. I wanted to wait out for Michael B. Jordan as CK Moore,  a character who is flamboyant and cocky (yes, I dream big), but I figured forging ahead with the actors I had at hand was to my best interest. </p><p>I wanted ""Shayla's Catch"" and ""Before The Catch"" prequel to get to the core of what it's really like to date or marry a man of stature, who has prowess and money. The twists and turns will sometimes have viewers on an emotional roller-coaster, and at other times, the audience will feel a sense of romance and enlightenment. I present to you, ""Before The Catch,"" the prequel for ""Shayla's Catch.""</p><p>Your contribution as an Angel Investor to keep this project going - from production to pitching - would be greatly appreciate. Please check back for the breakdown of what is needed.</p><p>You can also contribute via $GoSJ via CashApp - the personal CashApp of Sonya Jenkins. Each $200 or more contributor will get a walk-on (2 line) role in ""Before The Catch"" prequel. </p><p>Thanks, in advance.<br/>Sonya Jenkins <br/>Producer/Director/Writer</p><p> </p></div>","Summary""SHAYLA'S CATCH""  REBOOT - The Prequels.

He often brags, ""The more they see me, the more they want me,"" but is put to the test as he juggles multiple women, who all claim him as their man. CK's main girl, Mia Falana, played by Amina Buddafly,  has to come to terms with whether she should hang on to her playboy boyfriend or give him a dose of his own medicine. The story presents many questions about faithfulness and loyalty - even down to CK's cousin Dexter Moore (Isaiah Lucas) who always watches out for (and sometimes lies for) his popular football star cousin, CK. ""Before The Catch"" also introduces Shayla Lucas (played by Kyleigh Campbell in the prequel) who is seeking an ultimate catch.  In ""Before The Catch"" viewers will also meet lovebirds, Steve and Tacara, Shayla's mom, Connie, Shayla's aunt Sydney, Deidra (a designer who owns her own boutique), Epiphany (an NFL owner's daughter), and her soon-to-be mentor, Claire Jones (played by me), who often advises her son, Diego Jones, in his own relationship dilemmas. The ""Before The Catch"" prequels will be less than 20 minute each - giving glimpses into the lives of each character - leading up to ""Shayla's Catch."" Director's Statement:The process of preparing for ""Shayla's Catch,"" the film, began before it even became a book, but when my nephew, a former college football player at Arizona State University, had a football game in Los Angeles against the USC Trojans in 2018, I scheduled a Table Read the next day. It went so well, that I had actors calling me to be a part of the project. I scheduled another Table Read and knew exactly who I should choose as Lead and Supporting actors. My first Shayla in ""Shayla's Catch"" is the daughter of Super Bowl Champion and former Wider Receiver of the Chicago Bears and L.A. Raiders (and the fastest man in the world in his age group) Willie Gault. I knew that Shakari Gault would be a good fit for the role of Shayla based on her acting ability (I had viewed some of her work), her knowledge about the football life and her beauty. The two tables reads and auditions, and my already promoting SHAYLA'S CATCH (the novel), garnered so much attention that people began texting and calling me (out of the blue) to ask if they could be a part of the project. Many offered something in return - their location (if they weren't actors) or wardrobe. But my actors auditioned for and earned their roles. I am so proud of my cast and the way we all came together. If I didn't choose them through an audition, I saw their work in film projects or on stage. I also took referrals. In short, I have the best cast I could ever dream of having. I wanted to wait out for Michael B. Jordan as CK Moore,  a character who is flamboyant and cocky (yes, I dream big), but I figured forging ahead with the actors I had at hand was to my best interest. I wanted ""Shayla's Catch"" and ""Before The Catch"" prequel to get to the core of what it's really like to date or marry a man of stature, who has prowess and money. The twists and turns will sometimes have viewers on an emotional roller-coaster, and at other times, the audience will feel a sense of romance and enlightenment. I present to you, ""Before The Catch,"" the prequel for ""Shayla's Catch.""Your contribution as an Angel Investor to keep this project going - from production to pitching - would be greatly appreciate. Please check back for the breakdown of what is needed.You can also contribute via $GoSJ via CashApp - the personal CashApp of Sonya Jenkins. Each $200 or more contributor will get a walk-on (2 line) role in ""Before The Catch"" prequel. Thanks, in advance.Sonya Jenkins Producer/Director/Writer",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to present a different perspective on the Asian Americans’ experiences. Asian Americans are usually categorized as the ones who are the most accomplished, efficient, and put-together. Not only does this project challenge that viewpoint, but it also helps relieve the pressure to be perfect off of many Asian Americans’ shoulders.</p>
<p>Additionally, this project reveals another intersectionality: the black bi-sexual female nerd who is still learning how to accept herself for who she is. The show takes pride in developing characters that are unique, as well as learning how to validate themselves. We open the doors for discussion on identity, relationships, friendships, college pressure, and our loyalty to uphold the family’s expectations.</p>

In order to make this web series the best as it can be, we have to prepare to transport our cast and crew, as well as equipment, efficiently and safely.  With a goal to avoid any issues during production, we have to properly prepare for any risks and challenges in order to make this film the best it can be.

<p>Let me introduce you to my new docuseries, Travel Queen ❤️;</p>
<p>Travel Queen will focus on volunteering for various altruistic organizations while also traveling on a budget as a single woman. It will highlight various subjects such as safety, gratitude, mental &amp; physical health, and the amazingly rewarding experience that is volunteering. <br/>The series will also explore whatever shenanigans I get myself into as a sideshow and burlesque performer, and enthusiastic extrovert, as well as exploring the amazing connections that can be made when traveling and the transformative experiences one goes through.</p>
<p>It will be raw. <br/>It will be honest. <br/>It will not be overproduced.</p>
<p>I feel like this series may be especially pertinent due to our current political environment here in the US. It's been so hard for me and so many other people I know to just sit back and watch the craziness. There's only so much we can do, and it varies for each of us. I hope that this series can help shine a light on the fact that there are other ways we can help, too. And that you don't need to be independently wealthy to travel and have amazing experiences, while simultaneously helping out the animals, the planet, or your fellow human.</p>
<p>In order to get Travel Queen off the ground I am looking to raise $35,000.  The money will be used to cover travel, crew, equipment, production, and post production costs in order to be able to complete filming in Thailand at an elephant sanctuary and return to the States to do post production, after which I intend to use the footage to pitch the show in order to get it picked up as a regular series.</p>
<p>Don't forget, if you can't donate, PLEASE share!  I want to get the word out about Travel Queen so I can make this happen, and you have the power to help me do it!</p>
<p>The show will be dedicated to the memories of Erin Briana O'Brien and of my father, Gerrit de Beer. (Therefore I'm gonna have to make sure the production we've got in the works kicks as much butt as possible). <br/>Thank you to everyone that believes in me. I'm so grateful to everyone that's been there for me over the past few years. They were some of the toughest I've ever had to live through but<br/>I've come out ravenous for life on the other side and I can't wait to sink my teeth into this exciting new adventure. <br/>This is just the beginning...<br/>❤️<br/>- Reina</p>

<p>Some small town folks from a farming community in Central California have masqueraded themselves into the Big City to show them that AWESOME TALENT can be found everywhere. Several residents from Hanford/Visalia area have quickly established themselves as formidable opponents in the Hunger Games that is Hollywood. A Talent Manager, A Filmmaker, Two Actresses, An Actor, Four brilliant boy wonders and a darling diva are making waves. Represented by some top agencies and management, booking roles on their FIRST AUDITIONS and staying humble to their roots.</p>
<p>That is how COMMUNITY THEATER was inspired. Our common thread is the admiration we have for the training and source of entertainment we received at our local struggling, Play Houses. Now that we are in the door, its time time to give back to our community and film a legitimate web series in our home towns and pay homage to the awesome and mostly crazy folks that bring theater to life and teach our children performance art, when the school system cannot. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5482790/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Kasey Atkins</strong></a> is a recent Film School Graduate. For several years he has been producing short features, documentaries and spec commercials. When his wife <strong>Christa</strong> found representation in Los Angeles, along with his nephew <strong>Wyatt Danger Schmitt</strong>. They decided to team up with other local child actors from the area that are also pursuing a career in Hollywood. This Pilot Presentation hopes to gain popularity and investments to carry on a full 12 episode season. Each webisode will be approximately 10 minutes. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In a rural area like Kings/Tulare County (3 hours North of Los Angeles) there is not a lot of opportunity for performance art, certainly not film. Most anyone who wants to perform does so at  their local Community Theater, which we are blessed to have a few of. Drama programs are cut all around the country and these outlets allow kids to learn performance art education hands-on and discover their inner talents. The several children in this series all started on the small stage locally and were discovered and encouraged by their teachers to pursue a dream of professional acting in Hollywood. Each of them have defied the odds very early and have found success that is building a career and future for them. </p>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>A local worn out but not forgotten community theatre is on the brink of being bought out to a pair of greedy real estate developers. Somehow Less Moore, the altruistic theater director must collaborate with his friends and oddball kids who never leave the Theater to create a plan, a play and a promise.</p>
<p>Aren't You <u>DYING</u> To Know What Will Happen?</p>

<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><u>The Message</u></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">While ""Community Theater"" will poke fun at the various characters you might run into on the small stage it carries some <u>very important underlying messages</u>. </p>
<ol>
<li> <strong>Arts Education is vitally important to our youth.</strong> California has slashed the budget for such programs and no such opportunity could exist without the amazing leaders in the community that donate their time to run non-profit community theaters and youth drama programs. By showcasing the tireless efforts of the community theater members and the kids whose inner diva was about to burst, we shed light on a sect of your community volunteer efforts you may not have been aware of and hope you will seek out a local theater to patronage. </li>
<li>
<strong>Theater is NOT a dying art form</strong>. For decades there is ongoing speculation that theater is a dying art form, especially in our media obsessed culture. While it is hard for local community theaters to get butts in the seats and keep the lights on, there is renewed energy in today's youth that are in need of an artistic sanctuary to express themselves. The kids find a strong love for plays and musicals and ditch their peers suggestions of pop music for show tunes. In recent years Broadway has had a renaissance of modern and compelling theater that crossed cultural and socio-economic barriers like<strong> Hamilton</strong> and <strong>Book of Mormon</strong>. Keeping the youth engaged in theater assures its survival and promises another generation that will shake NYC up and create even more cutting edge productions. </li>

<h2>Why We Need You?</h2>
<h3>Here is how <u><strong>$2000</strong></u> in donations will just begin to help us in getting this to your media screens:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A  required minimum insurance policy is needed to not only protect the actors but the venues we will shoot in as well. Quotes received range from <strong>$1600 to $2000 </strong>for a weekend shoot.</li>
<li>Our union performer receives a standard ""day rate""  plus possible overtime upwards of <strong>$200</strong>
</li>
<li>Since everyone else (volunteer cast and crew) is working for peanuts, we must provide them with <u>FOOD</u>. A craft service budget for the weekend can cost at least<strong> $150</strong> for a cast and crew of over 20.</li>
<li>Some Audio and Video Equipment will be rented and insured costing a fee of more than <strong>$300</strong>
</li>
<li>Post-Production and Marketing efforts can range from at least <strong>$250</strong>
</li>
<li><u>That puts us at a minimum of<strong> $2500 </strong>for producing just the Pilot !</u></li>

<p>UNBOXING is a web-series born out of the trending unboxing videos on YouTube with a dark twist. The concept was originally pitched at Melbourne Webfest 2019 which saw creator, Mitchell Holland, win the ABC iView Pitch competition, sending him to Marseille France for a writers room experience with LA industry professionals. Since then, a six part series has been written, a team of collaborative creators collected, actors auditioned and a funding video shot just in time for COVID to sweep the world and bring everything to a grinding halt. </p>
<p>But excitement around UNBOXING still exists! We know the strength UNBOXING has. It has received glowing reviews at table reads, won development awards and is just in need of funding to help bring it to life.</p>
</div><div>

<p>We want you to know your contribution is integral next step to having UNBOXING come to life. By contibuting it will be you who has made this possible. We are looking at a minimum goal of $45,000AUD to cover the costs of creating this project. This amount will help to pay our talented crew and actors, cover location hire, post production, marketing and catering. Whilst any spill over funds will pad us with insurance around any unexpected surprises, further script development for seasons 2 and 3, and a percentage donation to a men's mental health foundation.</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p><i>phase two</i> is a piece exploring what it's like being a <strong>twentysomething </strong>living in London - and what a mess it is. Your best friend might as well be your phone because let's face it, you never actually have the time, or the money to see the people you want to hang out with face to face.</p>
<p>Hashing out the plot of each episode was surprisingly easy when we started development, because we are our own audience. Our friends, social media circles, the media we were consuming all seemed to be telling different chapters of the same story. We saw that and we put that into <i>phase two</i>.</p>
<p>For the past<strong> four months</strong> the web series has been self funded, from hiring equipment to renting locations and feeding the cast, but in order to get it finished we need help.</p>
<h3><strong>Sassy Jam</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571652556/elp7juorj4ztfkqe2sbj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The brains of the operation, Satema is the ultimate producer, able to juggle multiple tasks without dropping the ball. Working within the Television industry she has picked up numerous skills when it comes to <strong>running the ship on a production</strong>. Able to shoot, edit, and corral - we're still looking to find something she can't do backwards and blindfolded.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571652591/tvdgzod76telrielabyl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jen is the story teller, penning new idea's, developing characters and storylines to shock, relate and admire, she also spends a lot of time laughing at her own jokes. Also working in the <strong>Television industry</strong>, she is able to flip from creative to administrator; organising shoots, scheduling cast and crew, and then flip back again to direct and shoot.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>£2000</p>
<p>The amount we are asking for is going <strong>towards our edit</strong>. We have seven completed episodes, and though we have basic editing skills, we don't want this to be the place where all our hard work falls short.</p>
<p>Every episode has its own tone and style and the editor we hire needs to be able to picture cut, colour grade, add visual effects, as well as sound edit all seven episodes - all of this comes approximately to the <strong>length of a short film</strong>. </p>
<p>Such a large job, requires us getting someone in who knows their stuff, will treat our project as something other than a quick patch job, and as such will be able to guide <i>phase two</i> to being the best version of itself.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you donate £1 you have our gratitude for supporting us on this! Upwards of this there are <strong>a range of perks </strong>for helping us on this journey from a shout out on our social media, first look at the pilot episode before it goes out on YouTube, to the chance for one lucky person to become an Executive Producer in the series. </p>

<p>This web series is the second of three projects planned for us in 2019. We started with a play towards the beginning of the year and hope to end with a short film.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
phase two is a piece exploring what it's like being a twentysomething living in London - and what a mess it is. Your best friend might as well be your phone because let's face it, you never actually have the time, or the money to see the people you want to hang out with face to face.
Hashing out the plot of each episode was surprisingly easy when we started development, because we are our own audience. Our friends, social media circles, the media we were consuming all seemed to be telling different chapters of the same story. We saw that and we put that into phase two.
For the past four months the web series has been self funded, from hiring equipment to renting locations and feeding the cast, but in order to get it finished we need help.
Sassy Jam

The brains of the operation, Satema is the ultimate producer, able to juggle multiple tasks without dropping the ball. Working within the Television industry she has picked up numerous skills when it comes to running the ship on a production. Able to shoot, edit, and corral - we're still looking to find something she can't do backwards and blindfolded. 

Jen is the story teller, penning new idea's, developing characters and storylines to shock, relate and admire, she also spends a lot of time laughing at her own jokes. Also working in the Television industry, she is able to flip from creative to administrator; organising shoots, scheduling cast and crew, and then flip back again to direct and shoot.

What We Need
£2000
The amount we are asking for is going towards our edit. We have seven completed episodes, and though we have basic editing skills, we don't want this to be the place where all our hard work falls short.
Every episode has its own tone and style and the editor we hire needs to be able to picture cut, colour grade, add visual effects, as well as sound edit all seven episodes - all of this comes approximately to the length of a short film. 
Such a large job, requires us getting someone in who knows their stuff, will treat our project as something other than a quick patch job, and as such will be able to guide phase two to being the best version of itself.
What You Get
Even if you donate £1 you have our gratitude for supporting us on this! Upwards of this there are a range of perks for helping us on this journey from a shout out on our social media, first look at the pilot episode before it goes out on YouTube, to the chance for one lucky person to become an Executive Producer in the series. 

The Impact

This web series is the second of three projects planned for us in 2019. We started with a play towards the beginning of the year and hope to end with a short film.
phase two is the biggest project of the three and we want to show that it's possible to set your mind on a seemingly insurmountable task - get up, make a plan, execute, conquer and repeat.
Though we are of course two women of colour, and the characters we've created follow suit: that doesn't mean our stories focus solely on race. 
It was important for us to create something that showed people of colour go through the exact same highs and hardships as the people around them with some of our storylines focusing on: mental health, relationships, dating and the heavy reliance of technology in keeping friendships alive.
phase two is universally relatable and at its core creates a community.

Challenges 
Getting to this point has been far from easy. We have been completely self-funded and were navigating sourcing locations, actors, unexpected drop outs, and coming up with a suitable day to film that fits with seven peoples schedules whilst having demanding full time jobs.
But we got here and we are thrilled!
Our biggest challenge right now is time. Ideally we want the edit to be completed by December 2019 so we can shift focus and work on promoting the series for its debut. As outlined above that requires finding an editor who can take on this large job. This requires them committing to an editing schedule that may have awkward timings, as it fits around our jobs and the other related bits and pieces that needs to be done to get phase two ready for launch.
So far with all the roadblocks that have tried to derail us, we have managed to find create solutions and make sacrifices in order to keep going. It's that mentality that has gotten us to where we are now and will help us to overcome.

Other Ways You Can Help

We are working on growing a following for Sassy Jam Productions, and so we would really appreciate your follows and your positivity.
When we start promoting in preparation for the launch we want to get phase two out to as many pairs of eyes as possible, so we would love your likes and retweets on Twitter (@SassyJam01) as well as your reposting on Instagram (@SassyJamProductions)!

<h2>Making TV Fun Again!</h2>
<p>Thanks for visiting our campaign. Vegas the Network is a new, innovating Cable TV, satellite, and streaming channel dedicated to bringing you entertainment from Las Vegas 24 hours a day, 7 days a week! Not a travel channel with host-driven segments...because...that would be boring! Rather Vegas the Network will be a fun, energetic lifestyle and entertainment channel. Think of us as a faster-paced and interactive combination of Viceland, E!, VH-1, and Comedy Central.</p>
<p>Our company and group are storytellers and entertainers, and it bothers us how boring TV has become with few shows to watch, and then once you find something, you binge ten episodes in three days and it's over until next season.</p>
<p>So, our team of independent filmmakers along with interesting and unique characters of Las Vegas are teaming up to create a new Cable TV and streaming network, dedicated to having fun, and blurring the line with social media and 100% focused on Las Vegas.</p>
<p>We want to create more original content than another other network, and integrate you into the shows when you visit Las Vegas. And, when you are back home, we want to keep you connected and entertained until you can come back to visit us again.</p>
<p>Our campaign in the first step in our equity fund-raising process that will provide the capital to launch the network. It will also lay a solid foundation for marketing, allowing us to create the first revenue for the network!</p>
<p>Your contribution to Vegas the Network is your opportunity to have a voice in the creation of the entertainment you consume, and when you are in Las Vegas, will give you the opportunity to be part of the cast!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Campaign Overview</h3>
<p>Our campaign has three objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>Raise $7,750.00 to finish legal work needed to setup our corporation and prepare preferred stock offering for investors</li>
<li>Raise $5,000.00 for our initial marketing push to create revenue from advertisers who will ultimately fund the network long term</li>
<li>Get your feedback</li>
</ol>
<p>We are planning to offer preferred stock through a crowdfunding platform, so we are asking donors to NOT contribute any more than $250.00 at this stage. If you want to contribute more, wait for the equity offering where you'll be able to buy a piece of the company, not just a perk!</p>
<p>Speaking of perks, on this first campaign, they are going to be pretty weak. Since we're a new company, we'll provide first edition logo swag for you. None of the core crew or creators have any swag yet, so you'll be first! Items will include resort and Vegas themed swag.</p>
<p>Since there is a chance we may not get to the finish line with a national launch, we are not offering perks that involve screen credits or on-camera appearances at this time. Our next campaign will contain those perks along with specifics about what shows you could appear on, if you aren't too shy!</p>
<p>In the crazy situation that we don't hit our total goal, we'll utilize the funds raised for the marketing and legal purposes outlined above. </p>

<h3>By Indie Filmmakers, for Indie Filmmakers</h3>
<p>On the surface, Vegas the Network is all about an interactive network where the audience becomes the cast, and people are entertained. Below the surface, Vegas the Network is a media incubator with the goal to create jobs in Southern Nevada in the film sector, and to allow creative storytellers to bypass the huge media gatekeepers who dominate the world of Cable TV. This will allow us create and deliver better entertainment, and more of it.</p>
<p>Our diverse Indie film making team includes business development professionals, writers, cinematographers, sound techs, camera operators, lighting pros, and many other accomplished crew members.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Reality Check</h3>
<p>Any creative endeavor that counts on advertising to survive is risky business, so we have to be realistic that there are likely challenges ahead. There is a chance that we could fail to get out of the starting gate if we fail to attract enough investment.</p>
<p>Due to our hard work and the credibility of our team, we are confident we will overcome the challenges ahead to create the most original, unique entertainment network and deliver on making TV fun again.</p>
<p>Our strategic approach to using the Indie film community for our crew, involving Las Vegas tourists and convention goers in our shows, and being creative as we engineer show concepts, we will be able to produce more content at a lower cost than any other network.</p>
<p>The more content for less money will allow us to produce more original content than any other network, and by integrating our social media conscious audience into the shows themselves, we'll be able to drive ratings beyond would our budget would predict.</p>
<p>We've already figured out the cost to launch the network in up to 30 million homes, engaged the production talent we need to start, and created the first 50 show concepts, forged the critical business relationships we need. We're ready to start production in June and look forward to launch this fall.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We made the above video on our phones to give you an idea of our humour and some of the issues we have had.  We can then make something you can all be proud of with the right resources!  We promise!</p>
<p>Initially we did have a producer, equipment and location, however the producer decided to change direction taking the location and equipment with him!  Thankfully someone donated rehearsal space for our workshops, Mark had some costumes, and Stacha volunteered her time at the location in the crowd -funder video in order to pay for it.  So it felt all was not lost!</p>
<p>Stacha Hicks, Actor and Filmmaker, (<a href=""http://www.StachaHicks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.StachaHicks.com</a>) creator of the series  explains  a few things below:</p>
<p>'I had the idea for this series shortly after I left film school.  But I had no real idea how to pitch for television, or how to work in television then.  I made films.  They were very different disciplines at that time.   And I was doing okay making films. Several years on however, finds me working as an actor (with a bit of writing on the side) and for the most part loving it. However there are less roles for women once you enter your thirties, and most of them do not reflect the diverse, weird and wonderful women that are part of our lives. It hurt to see us so poorly reflected in a medium that I have loved and given a great deal too.  Frustrated creatively I ventured into stand up as a way to create and perform work that I found both challenging and exciting.  I could write, book and perform my own act!!  Who knew!!'</p>
<p>On the Stand Up circuit I met Sheila Holdsworth (a comedian and a professional viola player) and Mark Coltman (also a comedian ,TV Presenter, Theatre Director).  I loved Mark's ability to rise to a challenge.  Both had warm likeable styles and were great improvisers.  It was in meeting them that I realised it was time for Murder and Maime the series.  We started work.  </p>
<p>We actively sought out others who were keen to create something different, something that they really believed in. Workshops have begun and the actors cast.  I write around the actors, we workshop and then I write.  Its a real ensemble piece and I am very excited to be bring comedians and actors together to learn from each other and create something unique to them.</p>
<p>Other than Sheila and Mark, I am pleased that we have following talented people attached to the project:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $20,000 to launch WoMTV and buy the WoMRadio Channel on BlogTalkRadio. The funds would be used to purchase 3-4 GoPro360 cameras, 6 LAV microphones, hiring 2-3 photographers to film, edit and mount each TV episode, all travel expenses for location filming on both the east and west coast, sponsoring small businesses who don't have the funds to have their voice heard, and adding social media advertising for their segments. Any and all donations are gratefully accepted, and perks begin at $150+.</p>
<p>What makes the WoMMedia Network unique is that we are focused on sharing mompreneurs - the new businesswoman - finding the balance between building a business and raising a family, as well as women in business who, like us, have grown from home-based to an office where now others are working with them. The journey is a remarkable one and WoM looks to empower, encourage, inspire and educate as we share the wisdom of women, in business and in life.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $20,000.00 the first $4,000.00 we raise will purchase our cameras and microphones and editing software, as well as incorporating the Word of Mom Media Network. The next $6,000.00 will help pay our film crew and cover our expenses when filming. $2,500.00 will enable us to purchase WoMRadio Channel on BTR - which gives us 4 live banners and a video on our show page for our advertisers.  The rest goes towards buying computers and recording equipment specific to podcasting and 12 months to rent a small studio to record. Once we accomplish all that, we want to offer production and administrative staff for both TV and Radio, a salary. With your help - we can make that happen!</p>

<p>Revisiting my memories about this great season, along with learning and sharing the memories of the team members, coaches, and the community, is why I'm doing this project.  As the student videographer for three years, I got to share many of the experiences the team did, and yet, when starting to do research, began to realize I had missed - or forgotten - a lot as well.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Six friends in a share house, juggle the pressures of work, bills and relationships. Each week the gang tackle new drama in the household on their path to adulthood.</p>
<p>The unsuspecting leader of the pack (that no one asked for), ANDII VAN HOULER has less sense than even the great onion eater - Tony Abbott. Like him, he works long, hard and absent mindedly at a car garage managed by his lazy but abusive UNCLE JIMMY. With Andiis five friends one of whom is his best friend and ex who are seeing each other behind his back, they are set to turn not only their lives but the lives of Melbourne upside down.</p>
<p>We wrote and made this show so people can relate to the everyday things we may go through in life. What it's like to be broke working hard, going on a date from hell, how boys and girls see things differently and no matter what we are struggling with we can always count on our family/friends.</p>
<p>The splash and buzz that the idea of the show on its own has created has been phenomenal. This show was created to put a comedic spin on the drama, stresses and problems we may face in our life. For people to have that relatability with it, when they watch it they sit there and point and say 'Yes, I've been through that'. Or 'I have a friend like that', and 'my first love was like that'.</p>
<p>Production companies have been contacted, and if we can raise the cash they will produce the show for streaming sites such as Netflix and Starz.</p>
<h3>Social Media Marketing Strategy</h3>
<p>1 - A dedicated videographer/photographer will create with our actors, pre-written skits and content that is exclusive for social media purposes.</p>
<p>2 - Our guest stars &amp; featured extras will be selected from a combination of Melbourne actors, models &amp; social media influencers that will assist with the marketing efforts of the show - similar to Fat Pizza with guest spots ft Kamahl, Angry Anderson etc.</p>
<p>3 - Utilising our fashion &amp; location partners, we will do exclusive photoshoots and cross promotion to help promote our TV show via their social media platforms, whilst promoting their brand via the show. This will not only save money but also gain an audience in Melbourne.</p>
<p>4 - We plan to create a Facebook community called TWTBAF that the showrunners &amp; actors will actively engage with our fans via. We will distribute exclusive content that way as well as get our audiences feedback.</p>
<h3>TWBAF Story</h3>
<p>Six friends in a share house, juggle the pressures of work, bills and relationships. Each week, the gang tackle a new drama in the household on their path to adulthood.</p>
<p>The unsuspecting leader of the pack (that no one asked for), ANDII VAN HOULER (21) has less sense than even the great onion eater - Tony Abbott. Like him, he works long, hard &amp; absent mindedly at a car garage, managed by his lazy, but abusive uncle UNCLE JIMMY LEAFRON (39). Working side by side with his friends CHAN &amp; GEOFFREY, they earn their pay and the scorn of many dissatisfied customers.</p>
<p>GEOFFERY HOLMES (22), is Andii’s partner in crime. He is a stereotypical African-Australian who wants to live the Scarface lifestyle, but is only a sickie away from the Centrelink lifestyle. He portrays himself as an African-American, with a deep love of rap and sport. Geoffrey and Andii like to think of themselves as God’s gift to women, but even they are no match for…</p>
<p>MIRELLA TARTINI (21) - A high maintenance Melbourne girl (an ex flame of Andii’s) with a new guy &amp; matching handbag each week. ‘No’ is a word that isn’t in her vocabulary, neither is ‘frugal’. She is a highly volatile drama queen, and serves as the catalyst in the group and the reason for all the drama.</p>
<p>But the father of the household is Andii’s other best friend SIMON BLACK (24), an aspiring Gynecologist from an old money, well educated family. Well dressed, he is a consummate gentleman who is drawn to Mirella, which creates tension between upholding the bro code &amp; listening to his heart.</p>
<p>One person who doesn’t care for the bro code is SOPHIA PRETTI (21) - a innocent &amp; sweet gobstopper of a girl, with a shady, psychotic centre that you’ll crack your jaw over. She doesn’t let any man stand over her, but if the right one came along she’d be by his side… digging a shallow grave. She serves as the mother of the house - if the mother were Kathy Bates from Misery.</p>
<p>Without a father or a mother though is CHAN CHAN (24.5), who is a mix between a Wog and an Fresh of the Boat Asian. He is the house sheep who is left with all the dirty work, but always aspires for more. His arc revolves around finding his real birth parents, whilst dodging the immigration office &amp; surviving through life with the only friends he has ever really known.<br/><br/>Together, we journey through their adventures in an episodic format, and whilst the dramas affect them, they can always rely on their friends because… that’s what the boys are for. .</p>
<h2>Meet the Characters</h2>
<h3>Andii Van Houler </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552474672/gfok3u4pjdxtwnkej9wd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>ANDII VAN HOULER(21) thinks life is one large rainbow lollipop sugar coated in love and legos. His short attention span to anything often gets him into a lot of trouble or in very sticky awkward situations.</p>
<p>By day Andii works at a car garage which is riddled with dissatisfied customers, confusing Connect Four games, a lazy, abusive boss (who happens to be his Uncle) and the burning remains of customer tyres, set alight to cook his lunch. Food is constantly on Andii’s mind - and if he isn’t eating, he is waiting to eat, or begging Simon to cook him something, or or buying Mirella cook books and cooking utensils or stealing Chan’s Mi Goreng for lunch.</p>
<p>But his love life is like his underwear - holes everywhere, changes everyday and completely covered in sh*t. Andii has recently split with ex Mirella, who remain friends. However now his best friend Simon has an interest in her - which makes Andii think.. does he want her back?</p>
<h3>Geoffery Holmes</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552474855/q29js4eczdavfzgtcgle.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>GEOFFERY HOLMES(22) takes the word gangsta to a whole new level - the next level. With Ambitionz Az A Ridah, he wants to become the next Tupac, but struggles to buy a 6 Pack.</p>
<p>His smooth &amp; confident personality creates his mindset of ‘God’s gift to women’ - which hides his deep need for substance, love and companionship with his on again, off again, girlfriend Tanisha. His arc will see whether he changes and his relationship survives.<br/><br/>Handicapped by his inability to read or write, Geoffrey makes up for it by being the coolest kid on the block (again to his detriment)</p>
<p>Geoffery takes it a day at a time, with his best mate Andii, coming in late, making up excuses, being plain lazy &amp; also shirking any violent encounters or responsibility.</p>
<h3>Mirella Tartini</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552474916/ztd8zswademkvza9fccs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>MIRELLA TARTINI(20) A high maintenance, alpha bitch who wears a new handbag, with a matching leash (that happens to be attached to a guy) every week.  ‘No’ is a word that isn’t in her vocabulary, along with frugal. She is a highly volatile drama queen, and serves as the catalyst in the group and the reason for all the drama.</p>
<p>With catch-phrases like, ‘I don’t call guys, they call me’; Mirella is a girl that expects a great amount - and learns throughout adulthood, that what you want, isn’t always want you need.  </p>
<p>Her relationship with relationships is insecure - being unsatisfied with a hot man, or as a single woman. After moving on from the Andii due to immaturity, she now wants a ‘real man’ casting her eye onto Simon. Yet all of her old tricks don’t work</p>
<p>Mirella is unemployed, living off the contributions of others. Soon she will be forced to understand the value of independence and rely on herself to fix her own problems.</p>
<h3>Simon Black</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552474968/d7dayrk4un4nubrnkjc1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SIMON BLACK (23) is a well educated, wealthy, consummate gentleman, almost living the life his parents dreamed for him - as a gynecologist.</p>
<p>Simon believes in dressing to impress, even formal in his bedroom attire. A natural &amp; responsible leader, this weighs heavy on his mind as he obsesses &amp; stresses over pleasing others and doing the right thing.<br/><br/>Simon’s greatest chore is babysitting his best friend Andii, who often sabotages the stability in the household due to his stupidity. Simon’s friendship to Andii comes at a detriment to his own happiness &amp; ambition…</p>
<p>Which conflicts with his own morality.  He will struggle whether to be a loyal friend and ignore Mirella (Andii’s ex) or be an adult and listen to his heart.</p>
<h3>Uncle Jimmy</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552474981/vzoofdcstsacpk1tivrb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>JIMMY LEAFRON(39), is a wild drunk, who is the antithesis of a self made man. Having inherited the family garage, he coasts on the back of others - whilst mooching all he can.<br/><br/>No need to put the Batman symbol in the sky, if the word ‘free’ is uttered, then you can be sure that Uncle Jimmy will be there, carting off the last of the goods.<br/><br/>As Andii’s Uncle, he serves as the only role model Andii (an already unstable human being) has ever known. Despite appearances, Jimmy genuinely cares for his nephew and will soon bail out the gang when they need it the most.<br/><br/>But until then, you can find Uncle Jimmy getting rejected from girl to girl (like a midget playing 1 on 1 against Dikembo Mutombo), down at the local pub if he hasn't passed out already at the garage.</p>
<h3>Sophia Pretti</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552475001/gttnrymci5gfg0zjx3kl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SOPHIA PRETTI(21) is both the most innocent girl you’ll have ever met - and the most murderously suspicious. Forever with an airtight alibi to get her out of a jam, Sophia has one foot firmly in the past, holding her back from really living with purpose &amp; freedom.</p>
<p>Sophia’s big passion is set firmly in designing clothes and creating art projects - yet struggles to find meaningful and sustainable work.</p>
<p>A believer in monogamy (even when her man doesn’t know it) and traditional gender roles, Sophia doesn’t live life as a pushover - yet her aversion to Tinder &amp; modern dating norms, leaves her love life drier than the Sahara desert.</p>
<p>Sophia’s past ends up catching up with her in the first season which hurts her standing in the group and raises questions - what has she been involved in, and what is she capable of?  </p>
<h3>Chan Chan</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552475013/zwnnru1mzm22ehcrkqkn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>CHAN CHAN (24.5) おはよう ございます is a misunderstood orphan, who needs friendship more than air (and mi goreng).</p>
<p>An Asian of some kind, Chan is disconnected from his heritage, having been raised by Greek parents. He desperately wants to find his birth parents (and avoid ASIO).</p>
<p>Chan lives on a steady diet of cocaine &amp; hookers, mainly by following them on Instagram due to his lack of social confidence.</p>
<p>A prideful man, Chan sees the power of hard work, but is easily manipulated by his friends for their own gain.</p>
<p>Identifying heavily with Bruce Lee, Chan sees himself to be a kung fu master - which might be the most physically harmful &amp; casually racist stereotype he has internalised about himself.</p>
<h3>Episode 1 : Pilot</h3>
<p>Andii wreaks havoc at the mechanic shop; whilst the house erupts in chaos over who will the dishes, forcing a trial judged by an uninvited guest - who abuses his power over the gang. A love triangle is formed.</p>
<h3>Partners</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Six friends in a share house, juggle the pressures of work, bills and relationships. Each week the gang tackle new drama in the household on their path to adulthood.
The unsuspecting leader of the pack (that no one asked for), ANDII VAN HOULER has less sense than even the great onion eater - Tony Abbott. Like him, he works long, hard and absent mindedly at a car garage managed by his lazy but abusive UNCLE JIMMY. With Andiis five friends one of whom is his best friend and ex who are seeing each other behind his back, they are set to turn not only their lives but the lives of Melbourne upside down.
We wrote and made this show so people can relate to the everyday things we may go through in life. What it's like to be broke working hard, going on a date from hell, how boys and girls see things differently and no matter what we are struggling with we can always count on our family/friends.
The splash and buzz that the idea of the show on its own has created has been phenomenal. This show was created to put a comedic spin on the drama, stresses and problems we may face in our life. For people to have that relatability with it, when they watch it they sit there and point and say 'Yes, I've been through that'. Or 'I have a friend like that', and 'my first love was like that'.
Production companies have been contacted, and if we can raise the cash they will produce the show for streaming sites such as Netflix and Starz.
Social Media Marketing Strategy
1 - A dedicated videographer/photographer will create with our actors, pre-written skits and content that is exclusive for social media purposes.
2 - Our guest stars & featured extras will be selected from a combination of Melbourne actors, models & social media influencers that will assist with the marketing efforts of the show - similar to Fat Pizza with guest spots ft Kamahl, Angry Anderson etc.
3 - Utilising our fashion & location partners, we will do exclusive photoshoots and cross promotion to help promote our TV show via their social media platforms, whilst promoting their brand via the show. This will not only save money but also gain an audience in Melbourne.
4 - We plan to create a Facebook community called TWTBAF that the showrunners & actors will actively engage with our fans via. We will distribute exclusive content that way as well as get our audiences feedback.
TWBAF Story
Six friends in a share house, juggle the pressures of work, bills and relationships. Each week, the gang tackle a new drama in the household on their path to adulthood.
The unsuspecting leader of the pack (that no one asked for), ANDII VAN HOULER (21) has less sense than even the great onion eater - Tony Abbott. Like him, he works long, hard & absent mindedly at a car garage, managed by his lazy, but abusive uncle UNCLE JIMMY LEAFRON (39). Working side by side with his friends CHAN & GEOFFREY, they earn their pay and the scorn of many dissatisfied customers.
GEOFFERY HOLMES (22), is Andii’s partner in crime. He is a stereotypical African-Australian who wants to live the Scarface lifestyle, but is only a sickie away from the Centrelink lifestyle. He portrays himself as an African-American, with a deep love of rap and sport. Geoffrey and Andii like to think of themselves as God’s gift to women, but even they are no match for…
MIRELLA TARTINI (21) - A high maintenance Melbourne girl (an ex flame of Andii’s) with a new guy & matching handbag each week. ‘No’ is a word that isn’t in her vocabulary, neither is ‘frugal’. She is a highly volatile drama queen, and serves as the catalyst in the group and the reason for all the drama.
But the father of the household is Andii’s other best friend SIMON BLACK (24), an aspiring Gynecologist from an old money, well educated family. Well dressed, he is a consummate gentleman who is drawn to Mirella, which creates tension between upholding the bro code & listening to his heart.
One person who doesn’t care for the bro code is SOPHIA PRETTI (21) - a innocent & sweet gobstopper of a girl, with a shady, psychotic centre that you’ll crack your jaw over. She doesn’t let any man stand over her, but if the right one came along she’d be by his side… digging a shallow grave. She serves as the mother of the house - if the mother were Kathy Bates from Misery.
Without a father or a mother though is CHAN CHAN (24.5), who is a mix between a Wog and an Fresh of the Boat Asian. He is the house sheep who is left with all the dirty work, but always aspires for more. His arc revolves around finding his real birth parents, whilst dodging the immigration office & surviving through life with the only friends he has ever really known.Together, we journey through their adventures in an episodic format, and whilst the dramas affect them, they can always rely on their friends because… that’s what the boys are for. .
Meet the Characters
Andii Van Houler 

ANDII VAN HOULER(21) thinks life is one large rainbow lollipop sugar coated in love and legos. His short attention span to anything often gets him into a lot of trouble or in very sticky awkward situations.
By day Andii works at a car garage which is riddled with dissatisfied customers, confusing Connect Four games, a lazy, abusive boss (who happens to be his Uncle) and the burning remains of customer tyres, set alight to cook his lunch. Food is constantly on Andii’s mind - and if he isn’t eating, he is waiting to eat, or begging Simon to cook him something, or or buying Mirella cook books and cooking utensils or stealing Chan’s Mi Goreng for lunch.
But his love life is like his underwear - holes everywhere, changes everyday and completely covered in sh*t. Andii has recently split with ex Mirella, who remain friends. However now his best friend Simon has an interest in her - which makes Andii think.. does he want her back?
Geoffery Holmes

GEOFFERY HOLMES(22) takes the word gangsta to a whole new level - the next level. With Ambitionz Az A Ridah, he wants to become the next Tupac, but struggles to buy a 6 Pack.
His smooth & confident personality creates his mindset of ‘God’s gift to women’ - which hides his deep need for substance, love and companionship with his on again, off again, girlfriend Tanisha. His arc will see whether he changes and his relationship survives.Handicapped by his inability to read or write, Geoffrey makes up for it by being the coolest kid on the block (again to his detriment)
Geoffery takes it a day at a time, with his best mate Andii, coming in late, making up excuses, being plain lazy & also shirking any violent encounters or responsibility.
Mirella Tartini

MIRELLA TARTINI(20) A high maintenance, alpha bitch who wears a new handbag, with a matching leash (that happens to be attached to a guy) every week.  ‘No’ is a word that isn’t in her vocabulary, along with frugal. She is a highly volatile drama queen, and serves as the catalyst in the group and the reason for all the drama.
With catch-phrases like, ‘I don’t call guys, they call me’; Mirella is a girl that expects a great amount - and learns throughout adulthood, that what you want, isn’t always want you need.  
Her relationship with relationships is insecure - being unsatisfied with a hot man, or as a single woman. After moving on from the Andii due to immaturity, she now wants a ‘real man’ casting her eye onto Simon. Yet all of her old tricks don’t work
Mirella is unemployed, living off the contributions of others. Soon she will be forced to understand the value of independence and rely on herself to fix her own problems.
Simon Black

SIMON BLACK (23) is a well educated, wealthy, consummate gentleman, almost living the life his parents dreamed for him - as a gynecologist.
Simon believes in dressing to impress, even formal in his bedroom attire. A natural & responsible leader, this weighs heavy on his mind as he obsesses & stresses over pleasing others and doing the right thing.Simon’s greatest chore is babysitting his best friend Andii, who often sabotages the stability in the household due to his stupidity. Simon’s friendship to Andii comes at a detriment to his own happiness & ambition…
Which conflicts with his own morality.  He will struggle whether to be a loyal friend and ignore Mirella (Andii’s ex) or be an adult and listen to his heart.
Uncle Jimmy

JIMMY LEAFRON(39), is a wild drunk, who is the antithesis of a self made man. Having inherited the family garage, he coasts on the back of others - whilst mooching all he can.No need to put the Batman symbol in the sky, if the word ‘free’ is uttered, then you can be sure that Uncle Jimmy will be there, carting off the last of the goods.As Andii’s Uncle, he serves as the only role model Andii (an already unstable human being) has ever known. Despite appearances, Jimmy genuinely cares for his nephew and will soon bail out the gang when they need it the most.But until then, you can find Uncle Jimmy getting rejected from girl to girl (like a midget playing 1 on 1 against Dikembo Mutombo), down at the local pub if he hasn't passed out already at the garage.
Sophia Pretti

SOPHIA PRETTI(21) is both the most innocent girl you’ll have ever met - and the most murderously suspicious. Forever with an airtight alibi to get her out of a jam, Sophia has one foot firmly in the past, holding her back from really living with purpose & freedom.
Sophia’s big passion is set firmly in designing clothes and creating art projects - yet struggles to find meaningful and sustainable work.
A believer in monogamy (even when her man doesn’t know it) and traditional gender roles, Sophia doesn’t live life as a pushover - yet her aversion to Tinder & modern dating norms, leaves her love life drier than the Sahara desert.
Sophia’s past ends up catching up with her in the first season which hurts her standing in the group and raises questions - what has she been involved in, and what is she capable of?  
Chan Chan

CHAN CHAN (24.5) おはよう ございます is a misunderstood orphan, who needs friendship more than air (and mi goreng).
An Asian of some kind, Chan is disconnected from his heritage, having been raised by Greek parents. He desperately wants to find his birth parents (and avoid ASIO).
Chan lives on a steady diet of cocaine & hookers, mainly by following them on Instagram due to his lack of social confidence.
A prideful man, Chan sees the power of hard work, but is easily manipulated by his friends for their own gain.
Identifying heavily with Bruce Lee, Chan sees himself to be a kung fu master - which might be the most physically harmful & casually racist stereotype he has internalised about himself.
Episode 1 : Pilot
Andii wreaks havoc at the mechanic shop; whilst the house erupts in chaos over who will the dishes, forcing a trial judged by an uninvited guest - who abuses his power over the gang. A love triangle is formed.

<h3>Take Two</h3>
<p>Last year, myself (Gabriel Fowler) and my two closest friends (Alex Desjardin and Andrew Cohen) produced a five-episode season of an original web series titled, Art Less. We laughed, we cried, we fell in love with the show, and now we want to do it all over again.

<p>Obviously, we want to make more episodes, and a lot of you share that hope too. Luckily, we have plans to film a new and rebranded Art Less, including a total of six new episodes.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our budget includes feeding our crew for 10 days in July and  12 days in August, and once you factor in insurance, equipment rentals, post-production and promotional costs, etc. the budget is upwards of $3,000 all on a student budget. The point is, we need every dime we can get and rest assured, we will not be paying ourselves (everyone involved is volunteering their time and skills).</p>
<p>Here's what we need:</p>
<p>-Buying/renting equipment, especially a sound recorder, higher quality microphone, and a BLIMP Windshield, in order to make the dialogue/sound of the show as clear as possible. </p>
<p>-Craft services for our crew. Not a bag of off-brand Fritos and the half-eaten box of Ritz Crackers that our Moms have in the cupboard</p>
<p>-Insurance, so that we are able to film at local businesses, city-owned property, etc. with permission so we don't get arrested whilst filming.</p>
<p>-Post Production editors, foley artists, and voice over work for two new characters. </p>

<p>We hope to deliver a second season that improves in every way of that of the first season and that will make you laugh, cry and most importantly have a good time. </p>
<p>In short, the more money that is donated, the higher the production value of the series will be. If we don't reach our entire goal, whatever funds we do raise will go towards production.</p>

<h3>Hello, there </h3>
<p>Greetings and felicitations! My name is Eric VanDruff and with nearly 200 completed projects under my belt in areas such as commercials, promos, music videos, documentaries, live performances, international films, etc., I am excited to share with you my newest project, Technical Difficulties, a situation comedy series. This project is close to my heart because many of the stories are based off of me and two of my friends, Philip and Tyler, who co-created this show. We hope with your participation, we will bring to life a comedy series worthy of your support and we hope you will laugh and enjoy the show as much as we enjoyed laughing and creating it! To see my film work, please visit my site <a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/vp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vimeo.com/vp</a>. Also, please visit our Technical Difficulties: <u><a href=""https://fb.me/TDTVseries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://fb.me/TDTVseries</a></u></p>
<h3><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Story </strong></h3>
<p>Long Beach, CA. It may not be as glamorous as Hollywood, or as cozy as Orange County, but it’s right in the epicenter of the greatest region in the world. It’s the Jan Brady of metro Los Angeles. Well, with better boobs and no braces. So, like season four Jan? </p>
<p>Regardless, this glossed over city of nearly 500,000 people needs news that’s local! Who’s to provide this niche content, you ask? Leave it to <i>Around &amp; About Long Beach News</i>, the show-within-a-show run out of the Digital Media Center of a second-rate community college. This series follows <i>AALB'</i>s student producers, reporters, and the small faculty that oversees their misadventures. </p>
<p>This series, while satirical in its portrayal of broadcast news, still maintains a sense of realism by focusing closely on its characters---a group of diverse students who are all experiencing young-adulthood and transitioning into the professional world, as well as long-tenured professors and staff members who also face great conflicts, challenges, and decisions. </p>
<p>The situations our characters find themselves in and their flawed attempts at overcoming their shortcomings heightens the comedy and makes the lessons resonate more strongly.</p>
<h3><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Proof of Concept</strong></h3>
<p>Our end game, of course, is to make Technical Difficulties a long-running episodic series. Whether that's producing a full Pilot and subsequent episodes in-house or pitching the series to networks, we must first prove to them, and most importantly, YOU, that this concept has all the necessary elements to entertain audiences. Thus, we are producing a modest 5-minute (approx.) medley of scenes from our season one scripts that will allow you to meet our characters and get a feel for the show. </p>

<h3>HOLY WOW!</h3>
<p>Our first season, all 12 episodes, went LIVE on Youtube over the 2017 holidays! They were largely self-funded by its creator, Mike Dreyden along with generous donations from family, friends and fans like you. Thank you so much for your contributions.</p>
<p>We've accomplished so much over the last two years. First we became a <strong><a href=""http://www.brooklynwebfest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brooklyn Web Fest</a></strong> Official Selection and invited to premiere at the 2016 festival. In so doing, we received <strong>FOUR award nominations. PREMIERE SERIES AWARD, EMERGING VOICES AWARD, MADE IN NY AWARD and AUDIENCE AWARD</strong>. We were blown away and honored. Thank you BWF!</p>
<p>In December 2017 we received word that we were an Official Selection of <a href=""http://www.qflixphilly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>qFLIX Philadelphia</strong></a> and screened 3 episodes at the March 2018 festival. This past summer we also received word we were a <a href=""http://www.qflixworcester.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>qFLIX Worcester</strong></a> Official Selection AND Centerpiece Selection!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>On Sunday, October 14, 2018 we WON the</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>SWAG GALORE!</strong></h3>
<p>We want to step it up for our second season and reward the cast and crew with more than just ""copy, credit and meals.""  The entire team continue their tireless efforts to bring our show to the screen and we would like to better show our appreciation. Here's how you can help...</p>
<p>It takes a decent amount of money for a production like ours. From renting equipment, paying for locations, transportation, licensing music, post production costs, basic operating expenses, and of course lunch. It all adds up. We certainly hope you can find it in your hearts and your pocket books to back us.</p>

<p>There are a number of locations we are eager to book and you get to be a part of the process. Our VIPs will have first dibs in choosing and backing each location. Here's your chance to have a hand in designing the look of the show. Two lucky backers will be randomly chosen to attend the shoot at the location they back.</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES</strong></h3>
<p>It all started 5 years ago when I decided to write my memoir. I was in a transitional space emotionally and living situation. After a break up that devastated me, then couch surfing until I found a place I could afford, I moved into an SRO in Chelsea. The memoir was put on the back burner after I read an article in Backstage where artists, after dealing with rejection after rejection started creating opportunities for themselves. That's when it hit me. I am sitting on years of experiences only I have, obviously, and I could tell that story about, a story about leaving my 10 year real estate career, working in fitness then jumping cannon ball style into gay New York City nightlife and porn. I still can't believe I did that and that it went so far.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">~ Mike Dreyden</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549238729/slnypc7l5agye5icgl5v.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>THE CAST</strong></h3>
<p>THE GANG'S ALL HERE! Mike Dreyden (Available Light, This Side of Heaven, Child of the 70s, LAST CALL), along with actors Michael Vaccaro (Child of the 70s) and Robert Maisonett (AS IS, Latin Lives), Mair Heller, Bianca Leigh (The Nap, Hurricane Bianca), Clifford Ray Berry (How To Make It Big), Moe Bertran (House of Mayhem), John Dylan DeLaTorre (People You Know) and Matthew Montelongo (Daniel's Husband, West 40s) are all returning to their roles and round out this amazing group of actors.</p>
<h3><strong>CHECK THIS OUT!</strong></h3>
<p>Season 1 has been a great success! We have 141 Youtube subscribers and growing. Watch time by our Youtube subscribers is up 25% and up 76% by non subscribers, with over 7 thousand views here in the US, Canada, UK, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Australia. We also get fan mail from around the world too! We have 661 Facebook Likes and Followers and that is growing.</p>
<p>We need YOUR help to continue to grow and continue the next part this adventure. We are still a completely independent production. We don't have a big time studio or partner to help cover post production costs, so we still have to raise our production budget by April 25th or we won't be able to film this summer. $20,000 will allow us to produce a 9 episode season, and we have some exciting stretch goals planned if we pass our goal!</p>
<h3><strong>GUEST STARS &amp; CAMEOS</strong></h3>

<p><strong><a href=""https://stareable.com/explore"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">STAREABLE</a></strong> is a platform creating connections for web series creators with audiences who care about independent content, between filmmakers and their peers, and with traditional television looking for the next great voice.</p>
<p>LAST CALL has had a page on Stareable.com for a while now. We've connected with many talented creators from around the world. Recently we've become a top ranked series on the platform. Thanks to all of fans! We're honored!<strong> CLICK IMAGE!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>RISKS and CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p>Making a low budget series like LAST CALL (as compared to a lot of studio projects) brings many challenges. We learned this while shooting our first two episode, from losing locations to having actors drop out to having equipment break down, you have to be able to roll with the punches. We learned a lot of new lessons too, as we continue to create our first season, including the fact that some Indiegogo pledges don't ultimately go through if they are declined by the backer's bank--so make sure to verify your payment method will go through if you're interested in one of our higher level rewards!</p>
<p>With only our tenacity, AND YOU, our FAMILY AND FRIENDS backing us, you have a hand in us continuing our track record of producing a quality, award winning show on a shoestring budget. We love making the series and we are confident we can make a spectacular second season!</p>
<p>A note about the perks: This campaign we have special, one of a kind perks only <strong>OUR backers</strong> will receive. Delivery dates are only estimates and are subject to change-- but don't worry, Mike Dreyden will keep you updated! Some rewards also contain multiple availability dates for digital vs. physical delivery.</p>
<p>The VIP S2 Launch Party and Wrap Party will be held in New York City. We cannot provide transportation or accommodations, but we can promise it'll be all kinds of AMAZING!</p>
<p>There may be additional paperwork required to fulfill some rewards, such as producing credits or appearances on camera. This is for both your protection and ours!</p>

THANK YOU!
Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who donated to make our first season a reality! With your help, we were able to make a full season of 12 episodes! Now, we are getting ready to continue Leo's quest to opening his own bar!

HOLY WOW!
Our first season, all 12 episodes, went LIVE on Youtube over the 2017 holidays! They were largely self-funded by its creator, Mike Dreyden along with generous donations from family, friends and fans like you. Thank you so much for your contributions.
We've accomplished so much over the last two years. First we became a Brooklyn Web Fest Official Selection and invited to premiere at the 2016 festival. In so doing, we received FOUR award nominations. PREMIERE SERIES AWARD, EMERGING VOICES AWARD, MADE IN NY AWARD and AUDIENCE AWARD. We were blown away and honored. Thank you BWF!
In December 2017 we received word that we were an Official Selection of qFLIX Philadelphia and screened 3 episodes at the March 2018 festival. This past summer we also received word we were a qFLIX Worcester Official Selection AND Centerpiece Selection!
On Sunday, October 14, 2018 we WON the
qFLIX Worcester Audience Award in New Media!

SWAG GALORE!
We want to step it up for our second season and reward the cast and crew with more than just ""copy, credit and meals.""  The entire team continue their tireless efforts to bring our show to the screen and we would like to better show our appreciation. Here's how you can help...
It takes a decent amount of money for a production like ours. From renting equipment, paying for locations, transportation, licensing music, post production costs, basic operating expenses, and of course lunch. It all adds up. We certainly hope you can find it in your hearts and your pocket books to back us.

There are a number of locations we are eager to book and you get to be a part of the process. Our VIPs will have first dibs in choosing and backing each location. Here's your chance to have a hand in designing the look of the show. Two lucky backers will be randomly chosen to attend the shoot at the location they back.
EXCLUSIVE PASSES TO ALL OF OUR PARTIES!

We can't wait for you to join us and celebrate!

ABOUT THE SERIES
It all started 5 years ago when I decided to write my memoir. I was in a transitional space emotionally and living situation. After a break up that devastated me, then couch surfing until I found a place I could afford, I moved into an SRO in Chelsea. The memoir was put on the back burner after I read an article in Backstage where artists, after dealing with rejection after rejection started creating opportunities for themselves. That's when it hit me. I am sitting on years of experiences only I have, obviously, and I could tell that story about, a story about leaving my 10 year real estate career, working in fitness then jumping cannon ball style into gay New York City nightlife and porn. I still can't believe I did that and that it went so far.
~ Mike Dreyden

THE CAST
THE GANG'S ALL HERE! Mike Dreyden (Available Light, This Side of Heaven, Child of the 70s, LAST CALL), along with actors Michael Vaccaro (Child of the 70s) and Robert Maisonett (AS IS, Latin Lives), Mair Heller, Bianca Leigh (The Nap, Hurricane Bianca), Clifford Ray Berry (How To Make It Big), Moe Bertran (House of Mayhem), John Dylan DeLaTorre (People You Know) and Matthew Montelongo (Daniel's Husband, West 40s) are all returning to their roles and round out this amazing group of actors.
CHECK THIS OUT!
Season 1 has been a great success! We have 141 Youtube subscribers and growing. Watch time by our Youtube subscribers is up 25% and up 76% by non subscribers, with over 7 thousand views here in the US, Canada, UK, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Australia. We also get fan mail from around the world too! We have 661 Facebook Likes and Followers and that is growing.
We need YOUR help to continue to grow and continue the next part this adventure. We are still a completely independent production. We don't have a big time studio or partner to help cover post production costs, so we still have to raise our production budget by April 25th or we won't be able to film this summer. $20,000 will allow us to produce a 9 episode season, and we have some exciting stretch goals planned if we pass our goal!

AWESOMENESS!
STAREABLE is a platform creating connections for web series creators with audiences who care about independent content, between filmmakers and their peers, and with traditional television looking for the next great voice.
LAST CALL has had a page on Stareable.com for a while now. We've connected with many talented creators from around the world. Recently we've become a top ranked series on the platform. Thanks to all of fans! We're honored! CLICK IMAGE!

RISKS and CHALLENGES
Making a low budget series like LAST CALL (as compared to a lot of studio projects) brings many challenges. We learned this while shooting our first two episode, from losing locations to having actors drop out to having equipment break down, you have to be able to roll with the punches. We learned a lot of new lessons too, as we continue to create our first season, including the fact that some Indiegogo pledges don't ultimately go through if they are declined by the backer's bank--so make sure to verify your payment method will go through if you're interested in one of our higher level rewards!
With only our tenacity, AND YOU, our FAMILY AND FRIENDS backing us, you have a hand in us continuing our track record of producing a quality, award winning show on a shoestring budget. We love making the series and we are confident we can make a spectacular second season!
A note about the perks: This campaign we have special, one of a kind perks only OUR backers will receive. Delivery dates are only estimates and are subject to change-- but don't worry, Mike Dreyden will keep you updated! Some rewards also contain multiple availability dates for digital vs. physical delivery.
The VIP S2 Launch Party and Wrap Party will be held in New York City. We cannot provide transportation or accommodations, but we can promise it'll be all kinds of AMAZING!
There may be additional paperwork required to fulfill some rewards, such as producing credits or appearances on camera. This is for both your protection and ours!
Other Ways You Can Help
Now, we know some people just can't contribute, and we understand this. Here's another way you can help.
Our BIGGEST CHALLENGE is making sure that enough people hear about the NEW CAMPAIGN so that we can make our goal! Social media algorithms are not our friend. Email us today and we will send you our CAMPAIGN BADGES for you to share.

<p>Bald is more than just a passion project, it is the heart of soul of 2 Brown Girls Productions. We've put countless hours, sweat, lots of tears and so much of our hearts into this series. It is a semi-autobiographical series written by Dre about a woman whose foundation is rocked after being diagnosed with Alopecia, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss, which in Sonja's case is full body hair loss. We meet Sonja a year after being diagnosed and we watch her desperately trying to get her shit together but she can't catch a break. She lost her hair, she lost her job, she's about her to lose her friends and she might just lose her damn mind. Dre has taken real-life experiences that are incredibly personal to her and has found the humor in them. She has written a series that deals with universal issues like body image, insecurities, the bond between women and dating all while staying true to her story and her experience. </p>
<p>This series is important to us because it's personal, it's forcing us out of our comfort zone and it's said that some of the best work happens when you push yourself to uncomfortable place, [<i>Hello, uncomfortable zone!]  </i>it's a universal story that many people can relate to and it finally showcases different, unique stories and beautiful people of all colors, sizes, and backgrounds. This webseries is the epitome of 2 Brown Girls Productions and truly showcasing everything that is important to us but we can't make this without you.

<p>We have already filmed a teaser of the season one of ""Bald"" but we're ready to take it to the next level and film all of season one! After shooting the trailer we quickly learned it's not going to be easy to film season one BUT, we believe it takes a village to make a project like this and in order to make Bald a reality, we need you! Our goal is to raise $20,000 to hire a crew, equipment rental, feeding cast and crew and editing. Below is a detailed breakdown of exactly what your backing would go towards. </p>

<li>
<strong>Hiring a Crew: </strong>We need to hire a director, the director of photographer, grip + electric, sound person, editor, producers, production managers, production assistants and every role in between. We strongly believe that everyone deserves to get paid for their time and we want to be able to properly compensate our crew.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paying our Cast: </strong>Actors deserved to be paid and we want to make sure the talented group of actors we've cast in this webseries is compensated for all their work!</li>

<li>
<strong>Food: </strong>Our cast and crew have to eat and we would love to offer them healthy options that fit everyone's dietary needs.</li>

<p>Bald is all-encompassing. We all have perceived flaws that can sometimes hinder our relationships, change how we see the world and can be a block in finding our best self. Your support of this project is more than helping to raise funds so we can film the series. It’s about embracing those things we think are flaws. We know first hand what it feels like to be represented and to see yourself in a film or show and we want to be able to give that to other people. Bald is a project that we believe is important and can shed light on issues like alopecia, how women of color deal with hair/hair loss, the power and strength in female friendships. We think it's time stories like this get to shine and we would be honored if we could be the storytellers. </p>

<p>Hello to all of you who are reading us now! We are Bojana (23) and Milos (24). Attention (now, you will face a bunch of boring text) do not say later that we didn’t warn you.</p>
<p>But let’s go back to us- we finished the Faculty of Culture and Media. Since then we worked in our country as a Journalists for some period. Also, on our room wall you can find certificates in the field of public speaking, and acting.</p>
<p>Now I know that you think that we are some kind of brother and sister or boyfriend and girlfriend, but the real fact is that we are none of that. We really hate each other. The only thing we have in common is this crazy idea to implement our innovational project into action.</p>

Nakon toga smo radili jedno vreme kao novinari. Imamo sertifikate u oblasti javnog govorništva i glume. </i></p><p><i>Znamo da ste pomislili na to, ali ne, nismo brat i sestra, niti momak i devojka, zapravo mrzimo jedno drugo.

In the beginning of the venture hosts of this show will have only 25 euros each and they have certain time limit to get to their destination. The main goal is to exit from the current comfortable position into the unexpected way of life.</p><p>The accent of this show is based on not so typical handling, tearing down stereotypes and prejudice of everyday life, through our uncommon actions we will try to inspire you with our humor and will. Meeting new people and their life stories are just passing actions of each episode, in which we wont be afraid to go and think outside the box and overcome our worst fears. Along the way, we will try to earn money by doing creative things so that we have enough money to survive. The dynamism and unpredictability of this show we will maintain through everyday activity along the way. They will provide a fun aspect of this show which is one of the most important things.</p><p> </p><p><i>Švorc je putopisna emisija, zabavno-edukativnog karaktera, zasnovana na putovanjima dvoje mladih ljudi koji kreću na put modernog hodočašća.

Voditelji ove emisije sa sobom od finansijskih sredstava nose samo po 25 eura i imaju zadatak da za određeni vremenski rok stignu do zadate destinacije. Glavni cilj je izlazak iz dosadašnjih komfornih pozicija  i stupanje u sferu nepoznatog.</i></p><p><i>Akcenat emisije je na atipičnim snalaženjima, razbijanju stereotipa i predrasuda svakodnevnice, kroz naše nesvakidašnje akcije nastojaćemo da svojim humorom i voljom inspirišemo i vas.

We are Bojana (23) and Milos (24). Attention (now, you will face a bunch of boring text) do not say later that we didn’t warn you.
But let’s go back to us- we finished the Faculty of Culture and Media. Since then we worked in our country as a Journalists for some period. Also, on our room wall you can find certificates in the field of public speaking, and acting.
Now I know that you think that we are some kind of brother and sister or boyfriend and girlfriend, but the real fact is that we are none of that. We really hate each other. The only thing we have in common is this crazy idea to implement our innovational project into action.
 Pozdrav za sve vas koji nas trenutno gledate! Mi smo Bojana (23) i Milos (24), Upozorenje (susrešćete se sa gomilom dosadnog teksta) čisto da ne kažete posle da vas nismo upozorili . Dakle, završili smo fakultet za kulturu i medije. Nakon toga smo radili jedno vreme kao novinari. Imamo sertifikate u oblasti javnog govorništva i glume. Znamo da ste pomislili na to, ali ne, nismo brat i sestra, niti momak i devojka, zapravo mrzimo jedno drugo. Zajednička stvar zbog koje smo ovde jeste taj korak da sprovedemo nasu ludačku ideju u delo.  Svorc (Broke)  is a travelogue show, grounded on elements of entertainment and education. Svorc is based on expeditions of two young people that are going on a journey of modern pilgrimage. Relying primarily on the humanity of unknown people, hosts of this show are going on a journey passing through the cities around the world,using hitchhike methods as the only way of transport , a tent to crash in, and their possibilities for finding a place to sleep in.. In the beginning of the venture hosts of this show will have only 25 euros each and they have certain time limit to get to their destination. The main goal is to exit from the current comfortable position into the unexpected way of life.The accent of this show is based on not so typical handling, tearing down stereotypes and prejudice of everyday life, through our uncommon actions we will try to inspire you with our humor and will. Meeting new people and their life stories are just passing actions of each episode, in which we wont be afraid to go and think outside the box and overcome our worst fears. Along the way, we will try to earn money by doing creative things so that we have enough money to survive. The dynamism and unpredictability of this show we will maintain through everyday activity along the way. They will provide a fun aspect of this show which is one of the most important things. Švorc je putopisna emisija, zabavno-edukativnog karaktera, zasnovana na putovanjima dvoje mladih ljudi koji kreću na put modernog hodočašća. Oslanjajući se pre svega na humanost njima nepoznatih osoba, akteri emisije kreću u avanturu prolazeći kroz Evropske (svetske) gradove, koristeći auto stop kao osnovno transportno sredstvo, šator za spavanje, i svoje sposobnosti za pronalazak prenoćišta. Voditelji ove emisije sa sobom od finansijskih sredstava nose samo po 25 eura i imaju zadatak da za određeni vremenski rok stignu do zadate destinacije. Glavni cilj je izlazak iz dosadašnjih komfornih pozicija  i stupanje u sferu nepoznatog.Akcenat emisije je na atipičnim snalaženjima, razbijanju stereotipa i predrasuda svakodnevnice, kroz naše nesvakidašnje akcije nastojaćemo da svojim humorom i voljom inspirišemo i vas. Upoznavanje sa novim ljudima i njihovim životnim pričama samo su usputne stanice svake epizode, u kojima se necemo libiti da prevaziđemo zacrtane granice i prebrodimo sve svoje strahove. Usput, pokusacemo da zaradimo novac na  kreativne načine kako bismo imali za osnovne potrebe. Dinamičnost i nepredvidivost emisije održavaćemo kroz svakodnevne aktivnosti na putu. One će doprineti polju zabave koji je neizostavan deo ovog projekta.On the road activities:
Cringe-is a jar with tasks that the TV host couple will carry around with themselves throughout the whole trip, and which will contain little pieces of paper with written unpleasant tasks and public fears which will be written along the way. With certain task it will be concluded which of the hosts will draw out the paper and then try to fulfill the task.
Trying to make money on public places and other locations on as many different and interesting ways possible, without begging for money.
Meeting new people and their way of life, showing different cultures and unusual ways of thinking.
Every different transporter ( a person who will drive us ) will have an assignment to tell an interesting story about the situation it has found itself in.
Finding as cheap as possible food sources which will fulfill basic daily needs for food and water.
Showing the cities night life
„Catch the moment“ is an activity in which the host will visit the landmark of the city; on the given location, the people behind the small screens will have the oportunity to enjoy the surroundings while Milos and Bojana will try to bring to life the historical and cultural meaning of the object or landscape. They will emphasize the present as a one dimension where the past will be seen and the future loomed, and the moment of joy as the only parameter for a positive vibe.
 Life without rules, boundaries, patterns and convictions at which people live by, are things that inspire us to give an example of a positive way of thinking. We will try to tear down the prejudice and prove that the potential poverty of life cant be the excuse for not proceeding with your dreams and wishes.Život bez granica, pravila, ubeđenja i šablona po kojima čovek živi, su stvari koje nas inspirišu da kroz prikaz kreiranja sopstvene realnosti damo primer pozitivnog načina razmišljanja.

<p>We need money for a state of the art editor, sound editor, colour grader and for some distribution costs. We have worked so hard on this project for such a long time. We have both sunk meagre savings into the project. We just need a last little leg up to get this baby finished! </p>
<p>We wrote this project for us as women. We were sick of the held back, beige versions of women so often displayed in film and TV. We want the real deal. The real funny, good, bad, and otherwise.

<p>My mother always told me: “you may not be the smartest, maybe not the most handsome, but dammit you’re great at writing opening lines.” </p>
<p>As a Brooklyn College student, we’re given the opportunity (forced) to work on dozens of different student films over four years. Each of these shoots taught me about how film operates, and about what not to do on a set. I’ve worked with some incredibly talented people, some have become close friends whom I plan on working with for the rest of my life. Others, ehh, not so much. </p>
<p>Luckily for us, this isn’t just a student project. I’m fortunate to have a handful of professors here at Brooklyn College that believe in me. After a VERY rough pitch of Camp GetRight, I was approached by a professor about the Rosen Fellowship. One semester, two sleepless nights, and three rigorous interviews later, I was one of two film projects awarded funding. It wasn’t just money put behind this project, it was complete trust in my abilities, my team, and my passion. </p>
<p>Your contribution to continue to bring this project to life means so much to me and to my creative team. Even though I had the idea for this web series, it isn’t mine anymore. I chose to write this project with four remarkably talented writers. I trust my cinematographer and producer with my life. The crew are all so excited to work on this project with me, for free, and that blind passion isn’t something I’ve come across on other film sets. </p>
<p>Your donations go an incredibly long way. The money we’ve won to put this project on only barely covers the price of equipment, and we’ve got lots of mouths to feed. Our two biggest costs will end up being transportation and food. The entire cast and crew agreed to work for free because they love the script, the project, and the message. Each donation, in any amount, gives us the opportunity to shoot all of the pages we’ve already written. </p>
<p>Anyone who donates to our campaign, in any amount, will receive a huge thank you in our credits and a video from the cast and crew with our thanks. Check out all the other awesome perks you'll receive if you donate certain amounts! And...if you singlehandedly fund our entire campaign, I’ll marry you. Seriously, try me. I’m not kidding. Oh, and you can also have the calendar. </p>
<p>This project stands for what we can do as filmmakers. It’s our way of saying “Hey! Here we are, this is what we can do, please hire us.” This is our resume, business card, and our LinkedIn profile (we also have those too). This is our way of showing off what we have to contribute to the golden age of TV. </p>

<h3>THE SUMmary OF ALL FEARS</h3>
<p><strong>MISTER SANDMAN</strong> is a series of spooky bedtime stories for big kids.</p>
<p>Each episode tells the tale of some unspeakable horror that has been made manifest by the architect of our very dreams.  His goal is not to kill, but to conjure up intense emotions in his victims so that he may feast! He's not a cruel creature; he simply feeds on the fear that drips from so many stupefied souls. But sometimes, just sometimes, the fearsome nightly phantom is famished… and he goes a little too far.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>BRING ME A DREAM</h3>
<p>We are seeking <strong>$11,000</strong> to produce <strong>5 episodes</strong> of <i>Mister Sandman: Nightmares Manifest</i>.</p>
<p>Your support will go ""all on screen"", as they say. This means that every cent we raise will be put directly into the production costs of the show, such as: actors' fees, equipment, location fees and insurance, post-production costs, VFX, etc. </p>
<p>We know that we already have the beginnings of something SPOOKTACULAR,  evidenced by the work we did on our first teaser short. The camera gear and light &amp; grip package we used on that first ""episode"" really delivered and we have a highly skilled crew behind it all, who are also our long-time creative collective/dream-team.</p>
<p>If you've seen the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU35GLfpTBE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Teaser Episode</a>, the high quality we achieved with it was on a similar-sized ultra-indie budget. And the audience reaction has been tremendous, with around <strong>150,000 views</strong> on YouTube, <strong>1000's of likes</strong>, fantastic fan comments, and even some surreal <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0oMv8mQ44s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reaction videos</a></strong>!</p>
<p>Then there's the fan theories...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533285023/nmyvito5ie74ox3mpb3f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One of those isn't too far off the mark! But you'll have to support our project and help us get it made to find out which one I mean.</p>
<p>=)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>PARANORMAL PERKS</h3>
<p>What? You thought we were asking for money for nothing? What do you think this is, Hollywood?</p>
<p>Lucky for you and your wallet, we have some AMAZING perks lined up to help make contributing to MISTER SANDMAN worth even more than the experience of being scared speechless alone. We're going to give you the chance to get your hands on <strong>Spooky Swag</strong>, like some of the more unique items/props from the set, and a membership to the <strong>Iron Flamingo Army,</strong> with behind-the-scenes access during the making of the series. AND we will be releasing surprise perks along the way, including some hard-to-find, hand-made<strong> Mister Sandman Gear</strong>, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>PS - For a sneak peek at the perks that are percolating, check out <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/chadcosten"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our director's Patreon page</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>MANIFESTATIONS</h3>
<p>If you've read this far, you've probably guessed by now that your <strong>support is vital</strong> in helping us bring this series of MISTER SANDMAN episodes to life! </p>
<p>Our previous flight of dark fantasy -<strong> <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ca/movie/death-wish/id407659276"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Death Wish</a></strong> (a film we also crowdfunded here on Indiegogo), went on to play at numerous festivals, win some awards (Audience Choice Award, Vancouver Short Film Festival; Best Actress, Burbank International Film Festival), and get distribution on <strong><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ca/movie/death-wish/id407659276"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iTunes</a>, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Death-Wish-Emma-Karwandy/dp/B00EQA8JIK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon</a> </strong>and <strong>ShortsTV</strong>. And, for a short time, it was even HUGE in Japan!</p>
<p>So it feels pretty exciting to wade back into the dark, murky, monster-filled water and... well, hopefully not die. We just need a little boost from all of you to help make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>MONSTER MOVIES ARE EASY TO MAKE, RIGHT?</h3>
<p>Ummmmm...? Let me see... Death, Taxes, Newborn Baby, Feral Cat, Divorce, MOVIES.</p>

</div></div>","THE SUMmary OF ALL FEARS
MISTER SANDMAN is a series of spooky bedtime stories for big kids.
Each episode tells the tale of some unspeakable horror that has been made manifest by the architect of our very dreams.  His goal is not to kill, but to conjure up intense emotions in his victims so that he may feast! He's not a cruel creature; he simply feeds on the fear that drips from so many stupefied souls. But sometimes, just sometimes, the fearsome nightly phantom is famished… and he goes a little too far.
 

BRING ME A DREAM
We are seeking $11,000 to produce 5 episodes of Mister Sandman: Nightmares Manifest.
Your support will go ""all on screen"", as they say. This means that every cent we raise will be put directly into the production costs of the show, such as: actors' fees, equipment, location fees and insurance, post-production costs, VFX, etc. 
We know that we already have the beginnings of something SPOOKTACULAR,  evidenced by the work we did on our first teaser short. The camera gear and light & grip package we used on that first ""episode"" really delivered and we have a highly skilled crew behind it all, who are also our long-time creative collective/dream-team.
If you've seen the Teaser Episode, the high quality we achieved with it was on a similar-sized ultra-indie budget. And the audience reaction has been tremendous, with around 150,000 views on YouTube, 1000's of likes, fantastic fan comments, and even some surreal reaction videos!
Then there's the fan theories...

One of those isn't too far off the mark! But you'll have to support our project and help us get it made to find out which one I mean.
=)
 
PARANORMAL PERKS
What? You thought we were asking for money for nothing? What do you think this is, Hollywood?
Lucky for you and your wallet, we have some AMAZING perks lined up to help make contributing to MISTER SANDMAN worth even more than the experience of being scared speechless alone. We're going to give you the chance to get your hands on Spooky Swag, like some of the more unique items/props from the set, and a membership to the Iron Flamingo Army, with behind-the-scenes access during the making of the series. AND we will be releasing surprise perks along the way, including some hard-to-find, hand-made Mister Sandman Gear, so stay tuned!
PS - For a sneak peek at the perks that are percolating, check out our director's Patreon page.
 

MANIFESTATIONS
If you've read this far, you've probably guessed by now that your support is vital in helping us bring this series of MISTER SANDMAN episodes to life! 
Our previous flight of dark fantasy - Death Wish (a film we also crowdfunded here on Indiegogo), went on to play at numerous festivals, win some awards (Audience Choice Award, Vancouver Short Film Festival; Best Actress, Burbank International Film Festival), and get distribution on iTunes, Amazon and ShortsTV. And, for a short time, it was even HUGE in Japan!
So it feels pretty exciting to wade back into the dark, murky, monster-filled water and... well, hopefully not die. We just need a little boost from all of you to help make it happen!
 

MONSTER MOVIES ARE EASY TO MAKE, RIGHT?
Ummmmm...? Let me see... Death, Taxes, Newborn Baby, Feral Cat, Divorce, MOVIES.
Nope. Movies are a NIGHTMARE to produce. But produce them we shall, because we LOVE them and we know that YOU love to be scared and horrified by them too!
But one of the biggest challenges in producing any piece of art, especially as entertainment, is finding an audience. Fortunately, we cast a devious spell to lure Crypt TV into our dark domain, and they are eager to distribute the remainder of the Mister Sandman series.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I grew up as the youngest of three kids. I am 10 &amp; 8 years younger than my older siblings and so to  entertain myself, I would write and act out my own stories. I knew exactly what I have always wanted to do with my life before I even knew what it was called. Starting my Junior year of college, I began writing and producing my own screenplays. With every screenplay I have learned something new. I am very proud of the lessons and trials that came as I learned this craft because it has truly made me a better writer and filmmaker for it.</p>
<p>Fate stepped in when I met Iesah Hunter, a fellow writer and one of my closest friends. She came up with a fascinating concept in 'Toll Booth'  and I was able to develop the idea into a drama series format. For season two, we have both had a role in writing screenplays. Toll Booth season 2 is just the start of what is to be a wild and amazing ride.</p>
<p>Toll Booth is about paying the tolls in our lives to get what we want and need. Nothing is for free and everything worth having is at a price. The residents of WaterView will continue to pay tolls for the life they want and sometimes it comes with more than they bargained for.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to finish this film, we need a little extra support. Filmmaking is an expensive art form, did I mention that?  Here's what we need to finish the film:</p>
<p>Director of Photography/Color Correction - we have to pay the pros to make it look good - $2800</p>
<p>Gaffer  - $1400</p>
<p>Sound and Final Mix - $1000</p>
<p>Music -$100</p>
<p>Cast and Additional Crew (Make-up, Production Assistance) - - $3700</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't meet our entire goal, the likelihood of the show gaining the attention of networks, producers and web series festivals goes down tremendously. Since festivals are where new filmmakers careers are made, this is especially important in the grand scheme of things. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>1) Your contribution gets us one step closer to fulfilling our dream by making the best possible television series we can make.</p>
<p>2) We need more shows that includes the underrepresented and the oppressed. The kind of episodes we are filming this year for Toll Booth will lift people up, make them cry while entertaining them. </p>
<p>3) I have made several short films. I have written several features and recently a TV pilot. The dream all started with episodic TV. I am ready to bring that vision to life and produce solid episodes of Toll Booth this season that our growing audience can enjoy.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are asking for 1,000 dollars. I have already put a lot of my own money into this passion project. Many props and some costume elements have already been purchased. We still need money to pay for the theme song. The costumes for the monsters and villains still need to be made. I would also like to provide food and drinks for the cast and crew since many of them are working for free. We already have camera equipment and editing software from previous projects, but we do need another editor for digital effects. I will be making no personal profit off of this project. It will be available on YouTube for your viewing pleasure.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first risk is, of course, not raising enough money. Another challenge is that I have very little experience with digital effects and will need to bring on a reliable effects editor.

<h3>Synopsis<strong> </strong>
</h3>
<p>Warlocks are the most powerful magical creatures, and the most powerful Warlocks are those in control of the three sacred amulets.</p>
<p>Around the first campfires of this dawning age, stories were whispered of a majestic, but lost City. The City of West River, beautiful beating heart of the ancient world.</p>
<p>To keep peace in this world, and protect the Holy City, three crystals were endowed with tremendous power. These crystals were of the truest blue, hardened in the sacred flames. The crystals in turn were mounted into three encrypted amulets, one went to the Elves, one to the Warlocks, and one to the High King, (ruler of West River).</p>
<p>During the ensuing centuries, protected by the amulets, the noble city prospered and became a sanctuary for mystical creatures of every shape and kind.</p>
<p>Sadly however, great power and great wealth, inevitably engender great jealousy and great envy. Eventually a Cloaked and Evil Force assassinated the High King, stole his amulet, and slipped into the endless night. During the ensuing chaos the other amulets were also secreted away, and the long years of unending Darkness began -- a period of confusion, crime and war, desperation and desolation. A hell on Earth.</p>
<p>Over time the remaining guardians were decimated... and the great city was locked down. West River was a frightened, besieged place, a power no longer. Sadly, keeping evil out, also meant keeping out progress, hope and heroes. There were rumours of course, rumours that told of dreams and prophesies.... possible ways in, possible ways out. Unless the three amulets are recovered and restored to their rightful place however, there is little real hope for the future.</p>
<p>During this desperate time, when hope was a threadbare thing our hero appears. A comet slices the sky. Portents shift. And an orphan is left at the City gates. Blue Flame follows James Dowling as he comes of age, a young man of unique and surprising gifts.</p>
<p>Initially a reluctant hero, James is something of a screw-up, a con-man, a trickster, and riddled with self-doubt. Happily however, guided by a ghostly soul James begins to see, and he joins in the fight for the light as he does so, more and more of his unique powers are revealed. Still, life is never easy... in a world fraught with magical demons, dragons, evil warlocks, and an almost insurmountable darkness James is soon locked in an almost daily life and death struggle.</p>

<h3>We Love Food</h3>
<p>And who doesn't? Dine &amp; Dish Nation is a show for the everyday foodie. You don't have to be a culinary expert or have a refined palate to know when something is simply yummy! Season One has left a great taste with our viewers and we are excited to be filming Season Two!</p>
<ul>
<li>Dine &amp; Dish Nation was founded by Kam Carman, a local television and radio personality with more than 25 years of media experience. Moved by her passion for food and the Detroit area, she decided to start a show that highlights both. Since our premier in September 2018, the show has gained more and more viewers, and our social media feeds and website are beginning to flourish, as well. We consistently have thousands of viewers tuning into our show each week.</li>
<li>One of the greatest things about Dine &amp; Dish Nation is that it showcases every day, local people. Each episode features a fresh panel of three community “foodies” discussing three distinct dining establishments while chatting about local culture.</li>
<li>Help us continue to bring this rich program to the Detroit area by contributing to our campaign, and we'll show our thanks by sending you a gift! </li>
<li>Together we can capture the resurgence of Detroit and all the great restaurants the area has to offer! </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548358459/h6j3taijfyea6tonnsqe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why The Campaign?</h3>
<p>Creating a television show is very costly! As much as we love and support our community we need our community to do the same for us. We are an independent production company that paired with Detroit Public Television to broadcast our show to you, which means we receive no funding from PBS. But, like them, we’re dependent on contributions from viewers like you. </p>
<ul>
<li>We don't expect our viewers to fully fund us, that's why we also have sponsors. But to truly make the best show we can, every dollar we can get helps. Each donation will go directly toward our cost of bringing this show to you!</li>
<li>We've compiled an exciting lineup of gifts to show you how much we appreciate your donation. As we are foodies, we have set up these levels to reflect a five-course meal. This is the first time we are offering any merchandise for the show, and once this campaign ends, we don't know if or when we will again. This may be your only chance to get some of these items!</li>
<li>To learn more about each ""perk"" click on the side picture to expand it's description.</li>
<li>Your support, no matter the amount, helps us to keep bringing quality programming to every home in the Detroit area. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*IMPORTANT* </strong>Since we broadcast through Detroit Public Television we are REQUIRED by the FCC to list ALL  the names of those who donate to us during the show credits. If you choose to donate anonymously here, your name will still appear in our credits.</p>

<h3>We Love Our Community (The Impact)</h3>
<p>We hear it all the time when we're out filming. People who run or work at restaurants and live in Detroit, talk to us about how even just 5 years ago, many of the streets were lifeless. People didn't come out to dine let alone even walk around. But now... Detroit is having its renaissance and we want to capture it! The restaurant scene is growing quickly and we aim to highlight those bringing new business to The D and those who have held their ground through the tougher times. It's America's comeback kid and this city deserves its time in the spotlight!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Sixty-five percent of shows in our genre get canceled their first season. We've made it to Season Two thanks to our loyal viewers! But while we've already gotten ""off the ground,"" we need help with additional funds to continue to deliver for the community! Every little bit helps! </p>

And who doesn't? Dine & Dish Nation is a show for the everyday foodie. You don't have to be a culinary expert or have a refined palate to know when something is simply yummy! Season One has left a great taste with our viewers and we are excited to be filming Season Two!

Dine & Dish Nation was founded by Kam Carman, a local television and radio personality with more than 25 years of media experience. Moved by her passion for food and the Detroit area, she decided to start a show that highlights both. Since our premier in September 2018, the show has gained more and more viewers, and our social media feeds and website are beginning to flourish, as well. We consistently have thousands of viewers tuning into our show each week.
One of the greatest things about Dine & Dish Nation is that it showcases every day, local people. Each episode features a fresh panel of three community “foodies” discussing three distinct dining establishments while chatting about local culture.
Help us continue to bring this rich program to the Detroit area by contributing to our campaign, and we'll show our thanks by sending you a gift! 
Together we can capture the resurgence of Detroit and all the great restaurants the area has to offer! 



Why The Campaign?
Creating a television show is very costly! As much as we love and support our community we need our community to do the same for us. We are an independent production company that paired with Detroit Public Television to broadcast our show to you, which means we receive no funding from PBS. But, like them, we’re dependent on contributions from viewers like you. 

We don't expect our viewers to fully fund us, that's why we also have sponsors. But to truly make the best show we can, every dollar we can get helps. Each donation will go directly toward our cost of bringing this show to you!
We've compiled an exciting lineup of gifts to show you how much we appreciate your donation. As we are foodies, we have set up these levels to reflect a five-course meal. This is the first time we are offering any merchandise for the show, and once this campaign ends, we don't know if or when we will again. This may be your only chance to get some of these items!
To learn more about each ""perk"" click on the side picture to expand it's description.
Your support, no matter the amount, helps us to keep bringing quality programming to every home in the Detroit area. 

*IMPORTANT* Since we broadcast through Detroit Public Television we are REQUIRED by the FCC to list ALL  the names of those who donate to us during the show credits. If you choose to donate anonymously here, your name will still appear in our credits.


We Love Our Community (The Impact)
We hear it all the time when we're out filming. People who run or work at restaurants and live in Detroit, talk to us about how even just 5 years ago, many of the streets were lifeless. People didn't come out to dine let alone even walk around. But now... Detroit is having its renaissance and we want to capture it! The restaurant scene is growing quickly and we aim to highlight those bringing new business to The D and those who have held their ground through the tougher times. It's America's comeback kid and this city deserves its time in the spotlight!

Risks & Challenges
Sixty-five percent of shows in our genre get canceled their first season. We've made it to Season Two thanks to our loyal viewers! But while we've already gotten ""off the ground,"" we need help with additional funds to continue to deliver for the community! Every little bit helps!

<h3>About the Series</h3>
<p>When media outlets talk about Chicago, they either mention gun violence, political corruption, or the frigid weather. Such narratives impact young people in this city that either instills fear or pessimism over a brighter future. Chicago has a host of problems, but activism runs deep in this city’s history.</p>
<p>As proud Chicago filmmakers, examining the hardships and triumphs of citizens who molded Chicago and actively learning from their experiences is our focus. Whether they fought for workers rights, cultivated communities for their people, or transformed the artistic landscape, this city consists of defiant people who challenged the status quo. Young Chicagoans should not only possess pride in their city, but feel empowered to transform their communities, and the world.</p>
<p>Your support for this series will allow us to tell the people’s story to a massive online audience and facilitate outreach screenings at schools and community centers. The web series format is an effective tool for lasting change and we’d like you to participate in this effort with us.</p>

<h2>LOGLINE</h2>
<p>In coping with bipolar disorder, Malcolm crafts the newest comic book superhero “ManicMan!”  with the help of his small-town friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MISSION</h3>
<p>I want to spread awareness for bipolar disorder in a fun way that will not be triggering or harmful to the community. I want people to see us, know us, and I want people who are like us to feel comfortable sharing who they are (as long as they feel safe doing so). People with bipolar are just human, and they cannot fight this battle alone; they need a support system, and Malcolm’s friends are the perfect example of a support system. Maybe they don’t always do what’s best for him, but they are constantly working on learning more about the illness and adjusting themselves to help Malcolm get better, even if that just means making sure he gets up in the morning. </p>
<p>Lavender Blackbird's mission has always been to tell the stories that need to be told, that provoke real human emotion and real global change. It is part of our mission to provide visibility and representation to minority groups, especially people of color in the LGBTQ community. With an ensemble cast made up of diverse characters with different backgrounds, sharing stories from the Asian-American population as well as the Queer community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>GENRE</h3>
<p>This is a comedy-drama hybrid, kind of like Schitt’s Creek or Parks and Recreation meets Breaking Bad. It’s dark and deals with really scary topics sometimes, but it isn’t meant to send your heart palpitating. It’s meant to teach you while still putting a smile on your face. The point is to show how crazy of a life a life with bipolar can be. From climbing out your window because your friend didn’t say goodnight to looking down from a tall building to staying up until eight in the morning working on that project that you said you’d put down to scheduling thirty-three meetings on the same Monday you have work and dinner with the folks. Impulsive actions, impulsive shopping, and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>STRUCTURE</h3>
<p>In true Bipolar fashion, the series will jump back and forth between Malcolm’s mania and depression in five episodes of unpredictability. Each episode will start with a scene from the fictional comic, Manic Man, as the cold open. The series will mostly follow Malcolm and his three best friends who help him cope.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>IMPACT BREAKDOWN</h2>
<p>General breakdown of where your money would go:</p>
<ul>
<li>10% for locations and art department.</li>
<li>40% for cast and crew compensation.</li>
<li>50% for camera, sound, and lighting gear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Donors of any amount will receive a link to the LIVE workshop on March 28, 2021 at 7:00 pm CST.</p>

In Season 2 we are going to be bringing you longer episodes! Currently, we are green light for four 15 minute episodes with a possibility of more...but we need your help.   In producing and building the world of NarcoLeap, the KGP Films team have applied for grants and funding from all possible sources in order to bring you the high-quality sci-fi production via YouTube and HighBall TV. Now, we have tapped out every avenue possible, so this is why we are turning to our fans and the Indiegogo community for support in making Season 2 possible.  Due to the ongoing pandemic and COVID-19 related production regulations, the KGP team now require more funding than previously expected to cover personal protection equipment (PPE) for cast and crew members. These extra costs include hiring extra cleaners, purchasing more hand sanitizer and cleaning products, renting more space and tents to abide by social distancing rules, and supplying crew members with full suits and gowns as per regulations. A health safety officer is also required on-site to ensure compliance.  In 2018, YVR Screen Scene called NarcoLeap “the sci-fi escape that the world needs right now”. Looking back in 2020, given what is going on around the world, NarcoLeap Season 2 is perhaps the sci-fi escape that the world needs more than ever before.  To our fans: we appreciate you, and your continued support. We want to give you the opportunity to be more involved in the production of NarcoLeap and get insider access to how Season 2 is created.  We want this web series to inspire you to find your own inner superpower, grow into your own skin, and find your place in the world.     Chelsey ReistChelsey Reist graduated from Capilano University with a degree in acting for the stage and screen. She got her start as the host of the internationally broadcast travel series, Discovering Great Towns. Chelsey’s TV credits include a recurring role on The 100 (CW), as well as roles in Aftermath (Syfy/Space), Psych (USA Network), Cedar Cove (Hallmark) and The Tomorrow People (CW).  Chelsey feature film work includes the lead role in No Tell Motel, which appeared in the Cannes Film Festival. Chelsey is also a trained dancer of sixteen years. Madison SmithFrom a young age, Madison always wanted to be an actor, but instead he decided to attend college on a baseball scholarship and pursue a marketing career. After a few years feeling he was on an incorrect path, Madison followed his dream to get involved in acting, and packed up his bags, left Kelowna, B.C for Vancouver, and enrolled in Vancouver’s Academy of Dramatic Arts.After graduating from the academy in 2011, Madison quickly began booking numerous roles and has appeared in Netflix's The Order and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina The CW’s Riverdale, Supergirl, and Supernatural, CBS’ Salvation, and SyFy’s Aftermath. Austin EckhertAustin Eckert is originally from Regina, SK. Following high school, he attended the Canadian College of Performing Arts in Victoria, BC.

(WCT), many Bard of the Beach productions and more. His television credits include Supernatural, The Flash, Batwoman (CW), Project Bluebook (History), Narcoleap (Telus/CBC), Colony (USA), The Magicians (SyFy).  Aleks PaunovicActing came to Aleks while he was onstage in his hometown playing in a heavy metal band, his livelihood since he was 16. Remarkably the role offered was one completely against type as it was that of Roddy McDowall's butler in the 1994 TV movie Heads. Now bitten with the acting bug, Aleks combined his athleticism from his lifetime of boxing and turned it into a very busy career as a stunt actor.Since coming to Vancouver Aleks has built an amazing resume with over 100 credits. When you meet Aleks, or you watch him perform these difficult roles, you just know that with all of that leading man charisma there's star power in this man and that you will be seeing a lot more of Aleks Paunovic. Nicole OliverNicole Lyn Oliver was born in Ottawa, Ontario. She has a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from York University, a Masters Degree in Communication from Royal Roads University, and additional training from the British American Drama Academy in Oxford and London.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Lifties is an indie comedy web series and the first of its kind to originate from the Midwest. The series follows the crew of Mt. Schole, Minnesota as they struggle through the ski season and deal with a shell shocked head of ski patrol, a soulless city council bureaucrat, and the occasional moose encounter. There are currently two episodes available for free online.  </li>
<li>In order to continue the series, donations from viewers and sponsors are vital! The series has the potential to become the next Letterkenny, Trailer Park Boys...but it needs support to make it as great as it can possibly be. </li>
<li>We are asking for your support to help create the first-ever viral live-action web series to come from the Midwest! Help us revitalize snowboard/alpine culture and showcase the creative talent that our region has to offer, and finally to prove that the best creations don't have to come from a studio lot in Los Angeles. </li>

Lifties is an indie comedy web series and the first of its kind to originate from the Midwest. The series follows the crew of Mt. Schole, Minnesota as they struggle through the ski season and deal with a shell shocked head of ski patrol, a soulless city council bureaucrat, and the occasional moose encounter. There are currently two episodes available for free online.  
In order to continue the series, donations from viewers and sponsors are vital! The series has the potential to become the next Letterkenny, Trailer Park Boys...but it needs support to make it as great as it can possibly be. 
We are asking for your support to help create the first-ever viral live-action web series to come from the Midwest! Help us revitalize snowboard/alpine culture and showcase the creative talent that our region has to offer, and finally to prove that the best creations don't have to come from a studio lot in Los Angeles. 

What We Need & What You Get

Our current goal to produce Lifties Episode 3 is $1500.  Your contribution will go towards funding the production and nothing else. 
We are currently offering Lifties merchandise including custom travel mugs, stickers, t-shirts, and hats as perks for your support.
The creators of the series are not taking a paycheck. Even if we are unable to reach the $1500 goal we will use what we do raise to help offset the costs of production. Your money will go towards hiring crew members and cast, catering for the production, equipment, and licensing.

<p>Hola, somos el equipo de  Akasha Productions, una productora audiovisual donde buscamos registrar a través de nuestros lentes; todo atibo de conciencia en este mundo donde somos bombardeados constantemente con mensajes de odio y desconexión con nuestra esencia, hemos decidido crear un programa de Tv que constara de dieciseis capítulos llamado Legado; El retorno</p>
<p>En esta primera entrega buscamos grabar las manifestaciones, culturales, ecoturisticas y espirituales de la cultura Piaora en El Autana en la Amazonia Venezolana. Los piaroas son una comunidad indígena que habita en esta región, son guardianes de una sabiduría ancestral que guardan un mensaje de sencillez y amor a la humanidad</p>
<p>  Las comunidades Piaroas son un baluarte importante y un pilar de la humanidad. Con tu ayuda estas fomentando a la creación de conciencia, a mostrar un mensaje de unión a una antigua tradición, a ser parte de una comunidad que informa de manera diferente los ativos de la humanidad. Te invitamos a ser parte de la solución de una difusión masiva de esperanza. </p>
<p>Se parte del llamado del espíritu de conexión que anida en cada uno de nosotros, se la luz que enciende el ánfora de salvación en los corazones de la humanidad que pide paz, </p>
<p> En nuestro viaje visitaremos el cerro Autana, mejor conocido como el cerro de las almas o el árbol de la vida por los Piaoras. Ubicado en el Amazonas Venezolano haremos el recorrido en medio de la selva, capturando la hermosa fauna y flora del origen del pulmón más grande de Latinoamérica. El rescate de la biodiversidad mostrando la conexión de nuestra naturaleza interior con la imponente manifestación de la naturaleza del mundo.</p>
<p>Conoceremos a fondo la cultura de los Piaroas, sus tradiciones impulsando al mundo a conocer nuevas tierras y rescatar su legado y practicarlo en nuestro día a día. Mostrando el chamanismo inherente en su linaje, caza, pesca y demás formas de vida de su comunidad</p>
<p>La falta de recursos monetarios debido a la situación económica de Venezuela no nos permite poder trasladarnos por nuestros propios medios es por eso que recurrimos a ti para poder cumplir nuestro objetivo</p>
<p> Nos destacamos en ser positivos y con muchas ganas de realizar más proyectos que ayuden a concientizar a la humanidad, a promover cambios positivos que ayuden a la evolución y a la armonía global</p>
<p>Necesitamos de ti y tu aporte económico el cual nos permitirá costear:</p>
<p>               .-Transporte (son 2 dias de viaje desde nuestra ciudad hasta Puerto Ayacucho que es la ciudad mas cercana a la comunidad Piaroa)</p>
<p>               .-Guias especializado en la selva Amazonica (indispensable pues son doce horas desde la ciudad más cercana hasta el punto de conexión con la comunidad indígena en canoa)</p>

<p><strong>INSPIRATION</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the success of recent comedy web series that have found large followings and then transitioned to Cable and Streaming platforms, three comedy writers were reflecting on their own struggles of attempting to sell a show, get staffed, or noticed, or vaguely acknowledged. When they were considering applying to the HBO Diversity Program, they found themselves stymied in determining who was actually, in fact, eligible (Their conclusion: White men – no. Women – yes. Gays and the handicapped – surprisingly only yes if they were also a minority or a woman.) They decided to stop crying and start laughing – thus was born <i>Adversity</i>.</p>
<p><strong>SERIES LOGLINE</strong></p>
<p>Eight writers in a TV network diversity program, designed to cater to PC culture, compete for a staff position while being led by a racist, washed-up exec left over from the days before cable.</p>
<p><strong>A WEB SERIES ABOUT DIVERSITY (FEATURING A DIVERSE CAST AND CREW)</strong></p>
<p><i>Adversity</i> is a web series about diversity starring a cast that is 66% people of color and almost half female. To date, the crew is 73% women and 55% people of color. It's not hard to be an inclusive project, even if Hollywood seems to think otherwise. We're excited to give people of all types the opportunity to excel. This project is about diversity in every way!</p>
<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>
<p>This offbeat, shameless comedy follows the lives of eight diverse writers vying for a staff writer position on a television series at United Broadcasting Station (UBS), a once-prominent, but now-declining dinosaur network.</p>
<p>Morty Fischbein, network executive in charge of multiple Emmy-winning shows from the  1970's and 1980's, has finally been demoted down to Head of the Diversity Writing Program, as the UBS legal team fights the many lawsuits filed against him for discrimination and sexual harassment. His new position disappoints the diverse writing mentees, who expected anyone but an old white racist guy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they’re in for an even bigger shock when the final mentee arrives – a seemingly straight, seemingly white, seemingly male writer. But the original seven mentees scheme to figure out how this white guy got in, and at least it takes their minds off of the disaster program they find themselves trapped in.</p>
<p>As the series progresses, the writers become a kind of dysfunctional family, with all the positive <i>and</i> negative aspects that implies.</p>
<p><b>WE'RE GIVING BACK 5% TO CHARITY</b></p>
<p>We want to support organizations that support diversity. That's why we will be donating 5% of <i>Adversity</i>'s net profits to five charities and organizations that help both support diversity and protect equal treatment for all:</p>
<p>Anti-Defamation League<br/>GLAAD<br/>Human Rights Campaign<br/>NAACP<br/>National Diversity Council</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>Making a web series can be an awesome, collaborative, fulfilling endeavor. But, it also costs money. Every episode takes a lot of effort, a lot of time and a lot of people to make it happen. We firmly believe these creative and skilled people from the actors to the set designer, from lighting to sound, from the costume designer to the makeup artist, from the director to the cinematographer to the editor deserve to be compensated.</p>
<p>Your generous support will be used to help us pay for our 12-member cast, all crew positions, equipment rentals, insurance, locations, permits, transportation, food for the cast and crew, music, and post-production services, as well as festival fees. We greatly appreciate donations of any amount.</p>
<p><i>Adversity</i> is an independent production and everyone on our team has full-time jobs in the industry, but for this very amazing project, they are volunteering their services, even giving up paid jobs to get this series made. We are humbly grateful for their contributions. To date, this project has been self-financed by our Producers and is only being made possible through the incredibly generous support of our many collaborators, friends, partners, and now your donations. </p>
<p><strong>OUR CAST</strong></p>
<p>We’ve spent a long time casting and have found a very talented, wonderful ensemble cast. You’ll be given the chance to meet many of the actors further down the page.</p>
<p><strong>OUR CREW</strong></p>
<p>Our goal has been to find a diverse crew, as well as achieve a crew ratio of 50/50  women and men. It’s shaping up to be that and even more, and not because we’re trying very hard. It just turns out that there are a lot of very qualified women and minorities in the entertainment industry who are very eager to work on a show that promotes diversity, both onscreen and behind the scenes.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>As with any creative endeavor, there will always be unforeseen challenges and obstacles. </p>
<p>We are attempting to shoot ten episodes – with a final combined running time equivalent to that of a feature film – in twenty days. That's twenty days where anything can happen. Whether you're an indie production or studio-backed blockbuster, mistakes are bound to happen. Which is to say, there are some things that we can’t even anticipate at this moment that will certainly require us to use a contingency portion of our funds to fix the problem and make it go away!</p>
<p><strong>NO MONEY? NO PROBLEM! OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</strong></p>
<p>Support us by SPREADING THE WORD! More eyes mean more opportunity for us to share our project, and for us that's a big win. Blog about this fundraising effort, Facebook it, Snapchat it, Tweet about it, and e-mail your friends using the share tool, asking them to consider pledging, posting on their Facebook pages, and, soon enough, watching <i>Adversity</i>.</p>
<p><strong>PERKS: DANESE DESIGNS</strong></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce our newest sponsor, Danese Designs. Danese Designs has given us the opportunity to say a special thanks to some of you exceptional, generous individuals. Danese Designs produces necklaces with a personal touch and history combined with a high-end luxury feel. A few of these will be the perks given back to some of our sponsors who find themselves in the enviable position of being able to donate a bit more than the average person.</p>
<p>What makes Danese Designs different: Danese’s inspiration is rooted in her love of the ocean and her passion for the environment and wildlife. Danese uses only the finest natural gemstones from around the world. In each piece, she incorporates as many natural raw materials as she can. Holding the belief that, when you take raw materials directly from Mother Earth, it is important to give something back. <i>Adversity</i> will donate 1% from each qualifying purchase to the following ecological charities: Greenpeace Fund and the Ocean Conservancy.</p>

He once produced a short film for a 48-hour festival with only himself and a dog (and the dog’s owner’s voiceover, sent from the other side of the U.S.).

<p>San Francisco, 1968, with an audience mainly of flower children...hippies from the Haight district...my dad took me to a screening of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>...lots of smoke in rows 1 through 3...slowly wafting our way. My dad was kind of a ""square""...but I respected him. I watched him throughout the screening for his reactions. During the ""hallucinatory"" part of the film - entitled <i>Infinity and beyond</i> - I saw him...he was awestruck. What I thought was, ""How did this director, Stanley Kubrick, get all those scenes filmed in space?"" It was real...and I was hooked.</p>
<p>I wanted to Direct. Super 8 film was my first tool. I created with stop-motion animation - people as ""cars"" driving down real streets. People flying across the screen - without wires. Killer green pumpkins escaping the law. An epic remake of <i>Spartacus</i>.</p>
<p>All on Super 8mm. It was my canvas. I've worked for many great filmmakers. Listening to them and watching them work.</p>
<p>This led me to a collaboration with a great animator, Henry Selick (of Tim Burton's <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i>)...for which we won a Clio Award for an MTV top-of-the-hour station ID,<i> Insect</i>, which I photographed. I learned a lot from Henry. Mostly about patience, and belief in one's vision.</p>

</div></div>","INSPIRATION
Inspired by the success of recent comedy web series that have found large followings and then transitioned to Cable and Streaming platforms, three comedy writers were reflecting on their own struggles of attempting to sell a show, get staffed, or noticed, or vaguely acknowledged. When they were considering applying to the HBO Diversity Program, they found themselves stymied in determining who was actually, in fact, eligible (Their conclusion: White men – no. Women – yes. Gays and the handicapped – surprisingly only yes if they were also a minority or a woman.) They decided to stop crying and start laughing – thus was born Adversity.
SERIES LOGLINE
Eight writers in a TV network diversity program, designed to cater to PC culture, compete for a staff position while being led by a racist, washed-up exec left over from the days before cable.
A WEB SERIES ABOUT DIVERSITY (FEATURING A DIVERSE CAST AND CREW)
Adversity is a web series about diversity starring a cast that is 66% people of color and almost half female. To date, the crew is 73% women and 55% people of color. It's not hard to be an inclusive project, even if Hollywood seems to think otherwise. We're excited to give people of all types the opportunity to excel. This project is about diversity in every way!
STORY
This offbeat, shameless comedy follows the lives of eight diverse writers vying for a staff writer position on a television series at United Broadcasting Station (UBS), a once-prominent, but now-declining dinosaur network.
Morty Fischbein, network executive in charge of multiple Emmy-winning shows from the  1970's and 1980's, has finally been demoted down to Head of the Diversity Writing Program, as the UBS legal team fights the many lawsuits filed against him for discrimination and sexual harassment. His new position disappoints the diverse writing mentees, who expected anyone but an old white racist guy.
Unfortunately, they’re in for an even bigger shock when the final mentee arrives – a seemingly straight, seemingly white, seemingly male writer. But the original seven mentees scheme to figure out how this white guy got in, and at least it takes their minds off of the disaster program they find themselves trapped in.
As the series progresses, the writers become a kind of dysfunctional family, with all the positive and negative aspects that implies.
WE'RE GIVING BACK 5% TO CHARITY
We want to support organizations that support diversity. That's why we will be donating 5% of Adversity's net profits to five charities and organizations that help both support diversity and protect equal treatment for all:
Anti-Defamation LeagueGLAADHuman Rights CampaignNAACPNational Diversity Council
WHAT WE NEED
Making a web series can be an awesome, collaborative, fulfilling endeavor. But, it also costs money. Every episode takes a lot of effort, a lot of time and a lot of people to make it happen. We firmly believe these creative and skilled people from the actors to the set designer, from lighting to sound, from the costume designer to the makeup artist, from the director to the cinematographer to the editor deserve to be compensated.
Your generous support will be used to help us pay for our 12-member cast, all crew positions, equipment rentals, insurance, locations, permits, transportation, food for the cast and crew, music, and post-production services, as well as festival fees. We greatly appreciate donations of any amount.
Adversity is an independent production and everyone on our team has full-time jobs in the industry, but for this very amazing project, they are volunteering their services, even giving up paid jobs to get this series made. We are humbly grateful for their contributions. To date, this project has been self-financed by our Producers and is only being made possible through the incredibly generous support of our many collaborators, friends, partners, and now your donations. 
OUR CAST
We’ve spent a long time casting and have found a very talented, wonderful ensemble cast. You’ll be given the chance to meet many of the actors further down the page.
OUR CREW
Our goal has been to find a diverse crew, as well as achieve a crew ratio of 50/50  women and men. It’s shaping up to be that and even more, and not because we’re trying very hard. It just turns out that there are a lot of very qualified women and minorities in the entertainment industry who are very eager to work on a show that promotes diversity, both onscreen and behind the scenes.
RISKS & CHALLENGES
As with any creative endeavor, there will always be unforeseen challenges and obstacles. 
We are attempting to shoot ten episodes – with a final combined running time equivalent to that of a feature film – in twenty days. That's twenty days where anything can happen. Whether you're an indie production or studio-backed blockbuster, mistakes are bound to happen. Which is to say, there are some things that we can’t even anticipate at this moment that will certainly require us to use a contingency portion of our funds to fix the problem and make it go away!
NO MONEY? NO PROBLEM! OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:
Support us by SPREADING THE WORD! More eyes mean more opportunity for us to share our project, and for us that's a big win. Blog about this fundraising effort, Facebook it, Snapchat it, Tweet about it, and e-mail your friends using the share tool, asking them to consider pledging, posting on their Facebook pages, and, soon enough, watching Adversity.
PERKS: DANESE DESIGNS
We are pleased to announce our newest sponsor, Danese Designs. Danese Designs has given us the opportunity to say a special thanks to some of you exceptional, generous individuals. Danese Designs produces necklaces with a personal touch and history combined with a high-end luxury feel. A few of these will be the perks given back to some of our sponsors who find themselves in the enviable position of being able to donate a bit more than the average person.
What makes Danese Designs different: Danese’s inspiration is rooted in her love of the ocean and her passion for the environment and wildlife. Danese uses only the finest natural gemstones from around the world. In each piece, she incorporates as many natural raw materials as she can. Holding the belief that, when you take raw materials directly from Mother Earth, it is important to give something back. Adversity will donate 1% from each qualifying purchase to the following ecological charities: Greenpeace Fund and the Ocean Conservancy.

Nida Khurshid

Nida Khurshid was born in Lahore, Pakistan, and raised predominantly by her mother Naheed Yousaf, a school teacher and jewelry designer. Nida is of Pakistani, Irish and Indian ancestry, and grew up in a small farm town, East Bernard, Texas. She is fluent in Urdu and Hindi. She started modeling at 18 years old, her first gig being a contestant on Tyra Banks' America's Next Top Model. After returning from filming, she continued pursuing her journalism major at the University of Houston, but after a couple years, she decided to concentrate on becoming a model and actress. She moved to Los Angeles and got her acting career started when executive producer of American Crime, John Ridley, cast her in a recurring guest star role in his pilot, Presence. After shooting that, she was cast in another ABC pilot as well as roles on Nickelodeon and Fox, and modeled in several modeling campaigns.
Nida will transform into Farah Nejem, a transgender Dari-speaking Afghani who wears a brilliant purple burqa, but only when it serves her.

Matt McHugh 

Matt is from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He moved to Los Angeles from Mumbai, India, for a girl, but, when that tanked within the month, he stayed for all the other girls (spoiler alert: He doesn't date (further: ...not by choice...)). He actually stayed for the writing. Before the memory of that girl was even cold, he and his writing partner had written a sitcom script that would eventually make the finals of the prestigious Austin Film Festival.
When he realized how useless that was, Matt decided that, to get his stuff made, he'd have to do it all - write, act, produce. So, here he is, doing all three on Adversity.
Matt will act as Chad Chironna III, who dresses like a homeless frat boy going hiking in Runyon Canyon. Chad writes raunchy kegger farce, faith-based fidelity horror, and stop-motion anime musicals.
Nick Riggall

Nicholas has been in over 27 indie film projects, multiple web-series, commercials, and has been an avid student of multiple voiceover, scene study, audition technique, and improv classes blah blah blah blah…This is Nick. He loves acting and is grateful for the opportunity it has given him to explore himself and aspects of life he may never directly experience. He is really looking forward to seeing a few films he's been in (Mensch, American Muscle, The Murder Man) go to festivals, and to film his upcoming projects, Untrafficked and Adversity. He lives in LA, walks his Doxie-Pin, Royce, and rides his motorcycle to as many auditions as he can. Want to know more? http://nicholasriggall.com
Nick is set to play Sean Donati, a straight-laced, well-to-do law student who's just screaming to rebel. He’s Jessica’s fiancé, but he may be gay, but he also may just be scared of commitment...and a bit bi-curious.
Jonathan Konishi

Jonathan is an actor living in Los Angeles. He is excited to be a part of Adversity. He has starred in numerous commercials, television shows, short films, voiceover projects, music videos, theater shows, and comedy clubs.

His hobbies include improv-ing at UCB, watching WWE, eating at curry houses, and dancing at EDC.
Jonathan will bring to glorious life Hiro Masuki, a hipster who wears fine European slim-cut suits and clunky-framed glasses and who runs the UBS TV network. Hiro has an MBA from Fordham but doesn’t even watch TV. 
OUR TEAM
Producers/Writers, Director, DP, Line Producer, Casting Director
Matt McHugh - (Producer/Writer/Actor) - http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6515885/

Matt has co-created, written, co-directed, acted in, and edited another web series, Sibling Rivalry. (Here, he is obligated to state that it was originally his sister’s idea.) He looks forward to this upcoming web series, as he will have other people to chip in. However, he has to buy them lunch, which is a pain. He once produced a short film for a 48-hour festival with only himself and a dog (and the dog’s owner’s voiceover, sent from the other side of the U.S.). Now that he thinks about it, he realizes that he had to feed the dog, so, he supposes this won’t be too different.
A script he co-wrote about an alcoholic high school football coach who accidentally becomes a life coach was a finalist in the Austin Film Festival.
His shoulder made a cameo in the pilot episode of a Bollywood soap opera. It was cancelled during its first season.
He suspects he may have accomplished one other thing, but he can’t recall it as of the time of this writing.

DL Fairbanks - (Director) -  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0493464/

San Francisco, 1968, with an audience mainly of flower children...hippies from the Haight district...my dad took me to a screening of 2001: A Space Odyssey...lots of smoke in rows 1 through 3...slowly wafting our way. My dad was kind of a ""square""...but I respected him. I watched him throughout the screening for his reactions. During the ""hallucinatory"" part of the film - entitled Infinity and beyond - I saw him...he was awestruck. What I thought was, ""How did this director, Stanley Kubrick, get all those scenes filmed in space?"" It was real...and I was hooked.
I wanted to Direct. Super 8 film was my first tool. I created with stop-motion animation - people as ""cars"" driving down real streets. People flying across the screen - without wires. Killer green pumpkins escaping the law. An epic remake of Spartacus.
All on Super 8mm. It was my canvas. I've worked for many great filmmakers. Listening to them and watching them work.
This led me to a collaboration with a great animator, Henry Selick (of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas)...for which we won a Clio Award for an MTV top-of-the-hour station ID, Insect, which I photographed. I learned a lot from Henry. Mostly about patience, and belief in one's vision.
30 years later, my dream continues...I am honored to direct Adversity! Thank you all for contributing to our cause!

I ask that you kindly donate as little as $25 to our campaign so that we can produce 10 episodes.WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO TO HELP?If you want to support ""RELATIONSHIP"" but don't feel that you can contribute financially you can help tremendously by FOLLOWING AND LIKING ALL OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES.IG: www.Instagram.com/RelationshipDramaSeriesFacebook: www.Facbook.com/RelationshipDramaSeriesTwitter: www.twitter.com/Relationshipds You can also become an Official ""RELATIONSHIP AMBASSADOR""How can you do that? Help spread the word to the WORLD/ all your NETWORK!You can create a video informing your friends/family/network to follow our youtube channel and to follow our social media pages.Remember to hashtag us so we can see it:   #RelationshipDramaSeries & #DolphyProductionsMOST IMPORTANTLY, subscribe to www.Youtube.com/DolphyProductions as that's the only place the show will be aired (until we get a great network deal!...

<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>My name is Michaela P. Shelton and I am starting this campaign to raise money for season 2 of my web series, Reckless Behavior The Series. I am the creator, director, producer, writer and star of this series. </p>
<p> The web series will share the story of Michaela Holloway, a post college black millennial and aspiring writer, who navigates through life attempting to find herself and avoid reckless behavior. The web series is loosely based on my life and its purpose is to create something for us and by us that promotes the beauty and culture of the Bay Area. Its dual purpose is to bring to life my Reckless Behavior lifestyle blog series that was created four years ago. I am very passionate about creating relateable content and after the success of my self funded first season, I am hoping to continue contributing to black storytelling and inspiring as many people as I can. Through my web series, I have given opportunities to aspiring actors, up and coming musical artists and promoted a number of black owned businesses.</p>
<p>Reckless Behavior The Series has been mentioned on popular Bay Area radio station 106.1 KMEL, it has been featured on many blogs and podcasts and it has been selected for viewing at the 2020 Pan African Film and Arts Festival, the largest and most prestigious black film festival in America.</p>
<p>Please donate if you can! I would really appreciate it :).</p>
<p>Here is a link to season 1 episodes:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>                                                            CROSSOVER<br/>                         A 13 x 42 minute supernatural teen drama tv serial. </p>
<p>            “When the goddess comes hunting. Find the mother..... mother nature”</p>
<p>          When a teenage girl’s ancestry threatens to devastate everyone she holds <br/>       dear. Trinity and her friends become dangerously enthralled in an age old feud in <br/>        a supernatural quest to unearth the truth.</p>
<p>Jessica Fay is a multi award winning film maker from the North West U.K. At just 13 years old she put pen to paper on the pilot episode of ""CrossOver"". A year on she has written a 13 episode series complete with Tv bible and pitch documents. <br/>Jessica has been actively meeting with commissioner's, working with professionals in relation to her script and receiving invaluable support from seasoned industry pro's.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The time has come to make a sizzle reel to add to her pitch. The cost of this is approximately £3500. We are seeking help with raising £1500 which will go directly towards paying for our talented cast's travel, accommodation, aswell as location hire and food with Jessica funding the remainder.</p>
<p>We are offering professional photoshoots as perks, so if you are an actor in need of headshots or a family wanting to update your albums please consider helping us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If the sizzle reel has the desired effect you will be supporting Tv history. A teenage girl having her show brought to life. It may sound like a pipe dream but Jessica has proven herself time and time again, being recognised at festivals all over the world. </p>
<p>A direct quote taken from an industry professional on her pilot script</p>
<p>""; take it from me: you can write. I read hundreds of scripts a year and this pilot is well above average. I believe in you as a writer. And as you are on a level with many adult writers out there, I am going to treat your script as I would an adult's because you deserve it. You don't need special treatment.""</p>
<p>The fact that the writer of the above is a script consultant on iconic shows such as Harry Potter and Star Wars pushes Jessica even more in her quest to bring this to the screen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is that you support Jessica and CrossOver is never commissioned. I suppose you only fail when you stop trying. That is not something Jessica is planning on and I will be here to support her every step of the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share, please send the campaign link to your friends and family. Please talk about CrossOver and help create a buzz. Please visit the Sparkle &amp; Shine social media pages and say hi. Check out the Sparkle &amp; Shine Production page on IMDb.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is K. Lullaby (Kristen Acruz) and I am an English major and Personality and Social Psychology minor at San Diego State University. I have always had such a deep passion for storytelling and film making, which has sparked my motivation to pursue this particular story ""for real."" </p>
<p>My web series, ""<strong>Housemates</strong>,"" is about a group of college students from completely different backgrounds, learning how to live with one another and support each other through the many hardships that college students go through nowadays. This project is important to me because it highlights difficult topics such as sexuality, finances, immigration backgrounds and more, and though it is in a comedic tone, the purpose of this series is to show that students with different life stories can support each other and live together, as well as show audiences that their struggles are seen, valid and represented.</p>
<p>With stylistic inspiration from the television shows The Office, Friends, Superstore and Brooklyn 99, this web series is definitely the one to keep funded. Your contribution allows Lullaby Cinematics to hold a solid location, have sturdy and consistent props, and provide food for the actors and crew for the hard work they will be doing during the lengthy film dates. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In specifics, we will need funding in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location Fees</li>
<li>Catering for Cast &amp; Crew</li>
<li>Props/Production Design</li>
<li>Printing costs toward scripts and contracts</li>
<li>Transportation Reimbursement</li>
<li>Equipment Repair (just in case)</li>
<li>Possible team merchandise </li>
<li>Post-Production</li>
</ul>
<p>If you contribute to the following prices, you may receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>$ Your name in the ""Sponsors"" section of the credits</li>
<li>$ Access link to episode before it's released</li>
<li>$ Exclusive behind the scenes footage</li>
<li>$ Exclusive production vlogs</li>
<li>$ Exclusive photo prints of cast and stills from the set</li>
<li>$ Social media shoutout</li>
<li>$ Special representation in an episode</li>
<li>$ Personalized Thank You from the producers</li>
<li>$ Credit as an Associate Producer</li>
</ul>
<p>***If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds will go towards food and small props for the actors, crew, and set. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I have mentioned before, this series is valuable because it showcases many students with different backgrounds coming together to live with one another, and offers representation for each and many. Yes, it is a comedy and yes, these issues may not be the loudest piece of information in the room, but the actors do their best to portray dynamic differences between each character, to display the realities of many college students today. This show represents the following backgrounds: emotionally unavailable parents, Asian-American culture, adoption, LGBTQ+ struggles, financial struggles, atheism, Christianity, agnosticism, young pregnancies, etc. The goal of this project is to represent these backgrounds in a setting that is fun, comedic, accepting and inclusive, and to display how living with different people should really be like. </p>
<p>I have always believed that even through different views, backgrounds, and beliefs, love surpasses all. This is the show to prove it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some risks and challenges for this project would be the fact that we are all students. Some of us are working full-time jobs, others are attending school, and some are doing both. We are all trying to make this project happen with clashing schedules, difficult lives and different priorities. However, we are all determined to push through it as we have been these past few months. </p>
<p>Our efforts have been nothing but successful ever since the project began, and we are all very professional towards each other, being respectful and careful of everyone's time and feelings. The fact that we are all still here, fighting for this project to happen, says more than enough about this group of people, and frankly, I could never ask for a better team. </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p>I know that monetary contributions are not for everyone, but that does not mean you are incapable of helping! If you may, please share this project anywhere that you believe will help us out. Also, we are strong believers of prayer, so please keep the safety and financial provision for our team in your prayers (and if you don't pray, please do send positive vibes). </p><p>Remember to use Indiegogo share tools and thank you so much for your contribution. </p></div>","Short Summary

The Adventures of Indiana James is a web series produced by Thomas Pimentel and TNT LTD. PRODUCTIONS. This action/adventure/parroty (NOT A TYPO), spoofs The Indiana Jones films while telling an original storyline wrapped around the music and influences of Jimmy Buffett. Truly a one of a kind experience, Indiana James tips its fedora to some of the greatest films ever made including Young Frankenstein, Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, The Blues Brothers, Airplane and many more. An action/comedy with a cast of hundreds.</p><p>Coming to Vimeo in 2017. Join us for the adventure. You'll be sorry that you did. Thank you and Phinz up!</p><p>We are seeking completion funds to complete this highly anticipated web series, The Adventures of Indiana James. Notable people from the entertainment world including Jimmy Buffett and Frank Marshall, the producer of Indiana Jones, have seen rough cuts of our project and are waiting for us to complete it. Our production is also a part of a documentary titled, Parrot Heads, that will be coming out in January of 2017 that is also produced by Mailboat Records. Our goal is to have the web series stream on Vimeo when the project is completed. We knew that making a parroty (get it, parroty instead of parody!) of the Indiana Jones movies would be popular since the films have been so successful all over the world.</p><p> </p><p>“All About the Show”</p><p>Dr. Indiana James is a professor at The New England University of Mixology and is a favorite among the student body for his dedication to Mixology and adventures around the world.</p><p>The web series Chapters will be less than 30 minutes each and will be streamed on Vimeo in high quality HD with, premium sound mixing and original music by composer, T.J.

The similarities between Buffett and Indiana Jones are pretty amazing and weaving the two genres was actually quite easy once we got started.

The Adventures of Indiana James is a web series produced by Thomas Pimentel and TNT LTD. PRODUCTIONS. This action/adventure/parroty (NOT A TYPO), spoofs The Indiana Jones films while telling an original storyline wrapped around the music and influences of Jimmy Buffett. Truly a one of a kind experience, Indiana James tips its fedora to some of the greatest films ever made including Young Frankenstein, Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, The Blues Brothers, Airplane and many more. An action/comedy with a cast of hundreds.Coming to Vimeo in 2017. Join us for the adventure. You'll be sorry that you did. Thank you and Phinz up!We are seeking completion funds to complete this highly anticipated web series, The Adventures of Indiana James. Notable people from the entertainment world including Jimmy Buffett and Frank Marshall, the producer of Indiana Jones, have seen rough cuts of our project and are waiting for us to complete it. Our production is also a part of a documentary titled, Parrot Heads, that will be coming out in January of 2017 that is also produced by Mailboat Records. Our goal is to have the web series stream on Vimeo when the project is completed. We knew that making a parroty (get it, parroty instead of parody!) of the Indiana Jones movies would be popular since the films have been so successful all over the world. “All About the Show”Dr. Indiana James is a professor at The New England University of Mixology and is a favorite among the student body for his dedication to Mixology and adventures around the world.The web series Chapters will be less than 30 minutes each and will be streamed on Vimeo in high quality HD with, premium sound mixing and original music by composer, T.J. Kross.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4581550/?ref_=fn_al_...Our cast includes - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951148/)Thomas Pimentel starring as Indiana Jameshttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1582660/Jimmy Walker-Pearson starring as Dr. Marcus Dennyhttp://m.imdb.com/name/nm2800506/Christina Rondano starring as Marion Greatwoodshttp://www.take12tom.com/indianajamescast.htmlMichael LoPresti as Captain Jack Ticketscalperhttp://www.take12tom.com/indianajamescast.htmlWe knew however that it would be risky to incorporate the Jimmy Buffett twist but since I am a lifelong Parrot Head and Indy fan, it made sense to me. The similarities between Buffett and Indiana Jones are pretty amazing and weaving the two genres was actually quite easy once we got started. The web series is done in the style of the old Mel Brooks movies, Airplane, and Naked Gun. The jokes and action are not forced but instead come naturally and move our story along. You can also expect to see a few song and dance numbers along the way. We recreated all of the set pieces from the original Raiders of the Lost Ark film.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Blackveil Entertainment and its inaugural project, <i>Foreman, </i>were developed with the goal of giving individuals who might otherwise struggle to break into the industry a fighting chance. Our founder, Jillian Miles, is an Autistic trans woman, and a staunch believer in the cause of social justice - knowing that her chosen field might not be kind to her, she decided it was her responsibility to launch projects that would showcase her skills and the skills of like-minded individuals, especially those from marginalised groups.</p>
<p>This campaign hopes to fund <i>Foreman'</i>s first and second serials - the first, <i>Nirvi</i>, introduces our lead (played by Sonera Angel) and our Doctor (Ms. Miles herself), as well as Nirvi's ex-boyfriend, trans man Alex Starling. This inaugural two-part story explores concepts as wide-ranging as drug abuse, the need to belong, the journey from self-interest to self-sacrifice, and much more besides - all filtered through a heady sci-fi lens.</p>
<p>The second serial, <i>Predator, Pray</i>, explores the far future of the human race, sending the Doctor and Nirvi to Eschaton, hub of super-religion 'the Faith'. There, they encounter the Witness and come under attack by wasp-like aliens and their dangerous superweapon, the Raston Warrior Robot.</p>
<p>With your help, we can get the ball rolling on what promises to be a long and colourful career for Blackveil - we have several more projects in the pipeline and it is our sincere hope that <i>Foreman</i> will help boost our profile and showcase what our talented team can really do.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set a modest budget of £10,000 for our first two stories, much of which will go towards our film equipment and props, costume, and locations. While it is difficult to estimate the precise costs of creating our creatures and effects, we <i>do</i> know that our choice of camera and lenses will come to £4906. The remaining £5303 will help cover rent on our TARDIS set and otherwise pay for the costs of developing the project - we already own a wide array of fantastic camera equipment, we just don't have the camera or lenses!</p>
<p>However, knowing that transparency is important, we will make sure to update regularly with the quotes and estimated costs of our concept art, costume development, prop and location costs.</p>
<p>We'll be offering a range of weird and wonderful perks, including prop replicas, concept art, meet-n-greets, signed scripts, cameos and credits, and much more besides!</p>
<p>Were the campaign to make less than we hope, we will scale back and shoot the pilot alone, and work from there on successive launches, campaigns and similar to continue producing the series. If the minimum of £4697 to cover our equipment costs isn't met, we will rent and hire as needed to shoot the pilot, until successive campaigns can cover the cost of purchase - and if we don't make enough to meet our higher tier rewards, we will negotiate refunding and reimbursement as soon as possible.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>FOREMAN is a fan-produced series and is not authorised by the BBC nor it's licensees. It is a not-for-profit production and all proceeds from the crowdfunding initiative will be utilised in the production itself. The possibility remains that Foreman will face a legal challenge and be forced to cease production, at which point crowdfunding will be discontinued and all backers will be refunded their last payment where possible.​</i></p>
<p>Beyond this, there are always huge hurdles to producing the quality of visual and narrative we want - scheduling, design, construction and the like. But we've already met many challenges head-on and delivered. Our astonishing TARDIS, TARDIS set, and other sundry props and designs have all been delivered by a minimal, hard-working team.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Beyond pitching in to the campaign, it's absolutely possible for you - yes, you in the back - to get involved with <i>Foreman </i>and other Blackveil projects anytime.

<h2>All about the Project!</h2>
<p>___________________________________________</p>
<h3><i><strong>The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison. Which would you choose?</strong></i></h3>
<p>We all know at least one person suffering from a chronic disease and that number is growing. The rates of autism, diabetes, arthritis and auto immune conditions have sky rocketed in the last decade. A student of mine told me 6 of her family members currently have cancer! They live in the Canadian countryside surrounded by farms that are heavily sprayed with toxic pesticides. This is not normal.</p>
<p>People don't know how good it feels to feel good. To be able to sleep soundly at night and wake up in the morning and be full of energy and not need coffee. To feel energized and light in your step.</p>
<h3><strong>Let food be thy medicine and medicine thy food. It's a lot simpler than you think.</strong></h3>
<p>Choosing a plant-based, whole foods diet can be the single biggest environmental impact we make as an individual. Even more than if you decided to walk everywhere for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>The vision for the TV series is to show how simple whole, plant-based foods can heal the body and correct nutrient imbalances within us all while guiding us towards a happier, healthier self. We will rediscover, uncover and raise awareness about the plant-based lifestyle and how it can greatly impact our nutrition, health, and sustainability of our beautiful planet.</p>
<p>We plan to make this happen next spring, summer and fall while traveling cross Canada in a small home (tiny house/RV/camper van). Heal and Ignite Across Canada needs help to turn this vision into fruition. I'm looking at gathering $35,000 to get things started, which is 10% of our budget - the other 90% will come from grants dedicated to providing new and original Canadian content on TV.</p>
<p>My team and I are applying for a large grant via TELUS Fund. TELUS Fund provides funding to exceptional content that tells stories, engages, and enlightens the audience on their health choices. Their ultimate goal is to promote health and well-being of Canadians and to improve the quality of their lives. As an applicant, one of the things they require is to have a portion of the project funded, and proof of support from the community.</p>
<p>Heal and Ignite Across Canada already has 15 experts on board, from chefs to best-selling authors, doctors to athletes, healers, dieticians and naturopaths. We also have a broadcaster already! This means it will air on television! (This is one of the hardest things to secure and we've already accomplished it!)</p>
<p>Furthermore, those who contribute to the campaign will make up the community of individuals who advocate the benefits of this lifestyle, and believe that this project takes the necessary steps towards creating a healthier, happier Canada.</p>
<p>Should the funds we gather not reach the targeted amount, we will still pursue the project. In effect, the TELUS Fund’s grant amount will likely be reduced equivalent to what we’ve raised and we will re-evaluate the budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to share with everyone that the key to good health and long life is not a drug that is yet to be discovered or an extreme surgery and neither the next big fad diet. What we need in terms of nutrition, are the most power-packed whole foods that could be growing right in our own backyards. I want to promote an adventurous, mindful, sustainable, and nourishing modern lifestyle to the world.</p>
<p>But I can only do so much, and I need all the help I can get to reach more people and get the word out. TELUS Fund shares this objective, and I hope that you do, too.

___________________________________________
The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison. Which would you choose?
We all know at least one person suffering from a chronic disease and that number is growing. The rates of autism, diabetes, arthritis and auto immune conditions have sky rocketed in the last decade. A student of mine told me 6 of her family members currently have cancer! They live in the Canadian countryside surrounded by farms that are heavily sprayed with toxic pesticides. This is not normal.
People don't know how good it feels to feel good. To be able to sleep soundly at night and wake up in the morning and be full of energy and not need coffee. To feel energized and light in your step.
Let food be thy medicine and medicine thy food. It's a lot simpler than you think.
Choosing a plant-based, whole foods diet can be the single biggest environmental impact we make as an individual. Even more than if you decided to walk everywhere for the rest of your life.
The vision for the TV series is to show how simple whole, plant-based foods can heal the body and correct nutrient imbalances within us all while guiding us towards a happier, healthier self. We will rediscover, uncover and raise awareness about the plant-based lifestyle and how it can greatly impact our nutrition, health, and sustainability of our beautiful planet.
We plan to make this happen next spring, summer and fall while traveling cross Canada in a small home (tiny house/RV/camper van). Heal and Ignite Across Canada needs help to turn this vision into fruition. I'm looking at gathering $35,000 to get things started, which is 10% of our budget - the other 90% will come from grants dedicated to providing new and original Canadian content on TV.
My team and I are applying for a large grant via TELUS Fund. TELUS Fund provides funding to exceptional content that tells stories, engages, and enlightens the audience on their health choices. Their ultimate goal is to promote health and well-being of Canadians and to improve the quality of their lives. As an applicant, one of the things they require is to have a portion of the project funded, and proof of support from the community.
Heal and Ignite Across Canada already has 15 experts on board, from chefs to best-selling authors, doctors to athletes, healers, dieticians and naturopaths. We also have a broadcaster already! This means it will air on television! (This is one of the hardest things to secure and we've already accomplished it!)
Furthermore, those who contribute to the campaign will make up the community of individuals who advocate the benefits of this lifestyle, and believe that this project takes the necessary steps towards creating a healthier, happier Canada.
Should the funds we gather not reach the targeted amount, we will still pursue the project. In effect, the TELUS Fund’s grant amount will likely be reduced equivalent to what we’ve raised and we will re-evaluate the budget.

The Impact
I want to share with everyone that the key to good health and long life is not a drug that is yet to be discovered or an extreme surgery and neither the next big fad diet. What we need in terms of nutrition, are the most power-packed whole foods that could be growing right in our own backyards. I want to promote an adventurous, mindful, sustainable, and nourishing modern lifestyle to the world.
But I can only do so much, and I need all the help I can get to reach more people and get the word out. TELUS Fund shares this objective, and I hope that you do, too. With the afflictions that we face daily, chronic diseases and illnesses in children and adults – it is only logical that we do what we can to protect each other, the planet we live on, its creatures and our resources.
Support this campaign any way you can by contributing or sharing with your friends and family on social media. There are also many perks of contributing which make great holiday gifts!

Your support will contribute to the tipping point of consumer education, by empowering Canadians to take back their health and heal themselves with whole foods.
This TV series is just one project of many that I have been involved in over the years.

<h2>What is the Zomb Squad?</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome to the Post Post-Apocalypse!</strong> Mankind has survived the Zombie Wars! The undead threat has been greatly reduced with the introduction of the “Z” Vaccine. Everything is now as it once was: working schools, busy streets, stocked stores. There is, however, one significant exception: the occasional stray zombie’s<strong> <i>still gotta eat! </i></strong></p>
<p>For <i>SGT. JAKE ROMERO</i><strong>,</strong> and his unconventional team of hardened zombie hunters, this means business has just come back to life! Once heroes, who helped saved mankind from the brink of extinction during the Zombie Apocalypse, Jake and his<strong> Zomb Squad </strong>have now become nothing more than glorified animal control officers in keeping the living dead off the city streets. Whether it be an underground zombie fight ring, or a stray ambler locked in Annie May Sheffler's laundry shack, the <strong>Zomb Squad </strong>is here to clean up the mess!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494708860/wn12rnlzepedquwawyso.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i></strong> is an improvised comedy/horror scripted episodic program masquerading as a reality tv show that follows the <i><u>Post</u> <u>Mortem</u> <u>Subdual</u> <u>and</u> <u>Acquisitions</u> <u>Unit</u>,</i> or <strong>Zomb Squad</strong>, as its more popularly known. The show pays tribute to all the iconic zombie classics that have come before <strong>(<i>WALKING DEAD</i>, <i>NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD</i>)</strong>, while taking the piss out of a market oversaturated with zombie culture in the hilarious stylings of <strong><i>RENO 911</i></strong>. The series is set after the zombie apocalypse and generates laughs with everything from gross out humor to satirizing the politically correct nature of our times. <i><strong><u>This ain't your typical zombie storytelling!</u></strong></i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What The Hell Are We Doing Here?</h3>
<p>To put it simply, we need your help. We are seeking funding for <strong><u>3</u></strong> episodes of the <strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i></strong> web series.<strong> </strong>As you know, to do it right, making a television show, film or web series is a costly endeavor, and while we here at <strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i></strong> have access to talent, crew and equipment, and a plethora of great ideas, we are all blue collar artists working in the entertainment industry and barely scraping by at times. But this is what we love. And the thing we need most, the thing we have the least access to, is funding. <i>That’s where you come in, Oh IndieGoGoer.</i></p>
<p>A few years ago, I spent years trying to get a feature film produced. The script was original, funny and unique and we came close a few times, but the funding always fell thru in the end. I put the project back in the drawer and spent the next year shaking my head trying to figure out how to get work produced. I began to write scripts for an original television show and pitched it to producers with the same result. And then,<u><i> I read something in the back of a tv pilot scriptwriting book that I will never forget</i></u><strong>. </strong>Now, I’m paraphrasing, because its been awhile, but it read something like this: <strong>‘You don’t have the clout to take a script and put it on a producers desk and get it produced. That takes time. You may never get there, but if you don’t try, you’ll never know’. </strong>Now I know that was supposed to be uplifting, but what I saw instead was,<i> <u><strong>‘You don’t have the clout’</strong></u></i> and <i><u><strong>‘You may never get there…’</strong></u></i> and for a guy like me, who loves what I do and the ability to create, the thought that I may never get there or have the clout to make great entertainment, well, it just made me feel dejected. So, I tried to figure out how to gain the clout. And you do that thru the power of the people! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494716393/ca8dj2lyli1zu7jxnbih.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The most important reason to use Indiegogo, is because I know that throughout this community, there are <i>passionate</i>, <i>stalwart</i> and <i>powerful individuals</i> who are likeminded and who understand the creative urge, and who will help support an organized, creative and well thought out effort to do so. <u><i>So, what the hell ARE we doing here?</i></u> Glad you asked! We’ve decided to cut out the middle man and appeal to you, the audience, to give us the clout we need to get the job done. It ain’t rocket science, and it may be just funny lil zombies, but <strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i> </strong>is an opportunity to take charge of our own careers and make fun, entertaining content that people can get behind!<i> I don’t have the clout to put my script on a producers table and get it made,</i><strong> </strong><i>but collectively, </i><strong><i><u>“WE” </u></i></strong><i>do!</i></p>

<h3>The (Twisted?) Minds Behind The Zomb Squad!</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>CHRISTIAN STOKES</strong> is the creator, head writer, co-director, co-producer of <strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i></strong> and will play the role of <i>Sgt. Jake Romero</i>. Christian just returned from touring the US, Canada and Europe last year as the Performance Director for <strong><i>MARVEL UNIVERSE LIVE</i></strong>, the biggest arena stunt show of its kind, featuring the <i>Avengers, Spider-Man, Wolverine</i> and many, many more! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494711839/degy09hdm4doqd8rlky7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

He was one of the mutated inbred brothers for the ‘<i>8 Films To Die For</i>’ feature, <strong><i>LAKE DEAD</i></strong>. He has done stunt work for such shows as <strong><i>ALIAS, NO ORDINARY FAMILY</i>, </strong>and stunt double to series regular<strong> Zac Orth </strong>on the popular NBC tv show,<strong> <i>REVOLUTION</i>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TODD E. BRALEY</strong> is the other half of the Dynamic Duo that will co-produce and co-direct the <strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i>.</strong> Braley is a prolific writer and indie filmmaker that lives in Grand Junction, Colorado, with over<strong> <u>800</u> </strong><i>various projects</i>, <i>ranging from films to commercials,</i> under his belt. </p>

<p>Todd is the kind of filmmaker that has an idea, puts a group of driven individuals together and gets it done. His most recent works include <strong><i>THE CONFESSION, RAIN, MISFIT, KILL SHOW</i> </strong>and the web series<strong> <i>SURVIVING THE UNDEAD</i>.</strong></p>

<p><i> Todd just returned from Los Angeles where he directed the video for the first single off the new album from the legendary rock and roll band,</i> <strong><i>Great White</i>. </strong>Todd's professionalism, hard work and inspiration are glowing examples of why he is such an essential part of the team.

<p><i><strong>Jake is the leader of the Squad.</strong> He is one part Rick Grimes from the Walking Dead, one part Dog the Bounty Hunter, and one part Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty. Romero is a decisive leader, particularly when engaging the undead and he’s been doing it for a long time. He tends to put himself in danger because he has a sense of invulnerability and predestination. Used to date Vasquez once upon an apocalypse. He is the tie that binds them all together.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>JESSE “GAF” COOTS</strong> (Jesse Van Swol)</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494711914/uyiiqs8f1jodh1dufm9x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Gaf is a gay man trapped in a hairy heterosexual’s bear man body. </strong>Somewhat overweight. His homosexuality is non-chalant.  His bitching and constant state of defeatism is not. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop and knows the next apocalypse is right around the corner. Probably rabid alpacas or some other horror or another. Sometimes allows his daughter, Brittany, to join the team on missions for extra credit.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>GRIFFON COOTS </strong>(Cody Evans-Gan)</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494711961/orvthbr5wr7o9mmzsptv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Grif is Gaf’s younger brother, and is the best zombie tracker there has ever been.</strong> In fact, he eats like a zombie, sleeps like a zombie and breathes like a zombie. In other words, for all intents and purposes, he is pretty much a zombie. Except he ain’t. He doesn’t speak much. Silent but deadly. And, Yep! You guessed it. He smells horrible.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>MARVIN MARVINS</strong> (TBD)</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494709827/sedrqum8ixsjrz95i1ue.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Marvin is a poor man’s Dave Chapelle. </strong>Wiry and quick. Cries alot. On the Squad serving  out his community service. He’d rather be ANY place else. Funny in a crackhead sort of way. Has a thing for Gaf’s daughter Brittany. May be the only thing keeping him from running away screaming. And Griffon makes him nervous…a poopy pants kind of nervous!</i></p>
<p><i><strong>BERTHA </strong>(Heather Carson)</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494711988/voblxdlsw92b0x4rzbm3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Bertha is a big boned man hater and master interrogator.</strong> She is always in a bad Moo-Moo and in a worse mood. Woke up on the wrong side of bed every single morning. Enjoys whacking men and zombies alike with her bowling ball filled ditty bag! Kind of has the sweets for Griffon, but probably because he keeps his mouth shut. </i></p>
<p><i>Here are a few words from Bertha herself! (Actress Heather Carson)</i></p>

<p><i><strong>Vasquez is in great shape and built for combat! </strong>She makes Sarah Connor look like a Sunday school teacher. She is militant and knows how to use every weapon in the book. She can take you out quicker than you can say, “Wanna Netflix and chill?” Bad ass and in control. Hand grenade in one hand and a can of whoop ass in the other. She is to zombies what Rambo was to commies! Yeah, she’s the real muscle of the team!</i></p>

<p><i><strong>Texas Tim is an OG Zombie Hunter.</strong> Tim is wheelchair bound because he cut off both legs after being bitten by a zombie because he didn’t care for needles! No zombie vaccines for Tim! He is the Chuck Norris of the Post-Post Apocalypse! WWTTD! “What Would Texas Tim Do?” The man is a legend. A true cowboys and tough as nails. Likes to play guitar and fire off his shotgun. Some people tell he used to be a famous country and western singer before the world went to hell.</i></p>

<h3>What Happens To All That Cash?</h3>
<p><i>I know! <u><strong>$20,000 </strong></u>sure sounds like a lot of cash to me, too!</i> But, believe it or not, for what we are attempting, that figure is on the <i>shallow end of the cemetery</i> when it comes to producing network quality content. And don’t get us wrong! <i>We aim to try to get this show picked up by a network or streaming service at the end of the day, so every dollar counts when it comes to production value.</i> <i>We want to make sure ‘low budget’ isn’t equated with ‘low quality’. </i></p>
<p>This is<strong> Phase 1 </strong>of the funding for <strong><i>ZOMB SQUAD</i>.</strong> In this initial crowdfunding campaign, we are trying to <i>find the funds to physically produce the project.</i> <i>This includes travel, production, equipment, SFX, etc.</i> <u><strong>At this time, cast and crew are working for free.</strong> </u><i>Now, being a professional, <u>I believe in paying an honest dollar for an honest day’s work.</u> So, <strong>Phase 2 </strong>will be geared <strong>specifically to pay cast and crew.</strong></i> Finally, <strong>Phase 3 </strong>will begin after shooting is complete in August and will go towards <i><u>post-production on the series.</u></i> <i>The overall budget from <u><strong>all three phases </strong></u>of fundraising will be<strong> </strong><u><strong>$50,000.</strong></u></i></p>
<p>In <strong>Phase 1,</strong> we will need to build out our illegal zombie fighting ring location, purchase or create props and wardrobe, rent offices and space for<i> The Kennel</i> (<strong>Zomb Squad HQ</strong>), as well as convert vehicles into lean mean Zombie Apocalypse Fightin’ Machines! And, because we are keeping crew and production prices down by shooting in Grand Junction, CO and using my co-producer <strong>Todd Braley’s </strong>team of filmmakers, <i>we will spend the majority of our <u><strong>Phase 1</strong> </u>money on</i><u><i> transporting talent into the Colorado wilds and making sure they are housed and well fed.</i></u></p>
<p>The breakdown for <strong>Phase 1</strong> is as follows:</p>

</div></div>","What is the Zomb Squad?
Welcome to the Post Post-Apocalypse! Mankind has survived the Zombie Wars! The undead threat has been greatly reduced with the introduction of the “Z” Vaccine. Everything is now as it once was: working schools, busy streets, stocked stores. There is, however, one significant exception: the occasional stray zombie’s still gotta eat! 
For SGT. JAKE ROMERO, and his unconventional team of hardened zombie hunters, this means business has just come back to life! Once heroes, who helped saved mankind from the brink of extinction during the Zombie Apocalypse, Jake and his Zomb Squad have now become nothing more than glorified animal control officers in keeping the living dead off the city streets. Whether it be an underground zombie fight ring, or a stray ambler locked in Annie May Sheffler's laundry shack, the Zomb Squad is here to clean up the mess!

ZOMB SQUAD is an improvised comedy/horror scripted episodic program masquerading as a reality tv show that follows the Post Mortem Subdual and Acquisitions Unit, or Zomb Squad, as its more popularly known. The show pays tribute to all the iconic zombie classics that have come before (WALKING DEAD, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD), while taking the piss out of a market oversaturated with zombie culture in the hilarious stylings of RENO 911. The series is set after the zombie apocalypse and generates laughs with everything from gross out humor to satirizing the politically correct nature of our times. This ain't your typical zombie storytelling!
 
What The Hell Are We Doing Here?
To put it simply, we need your help. We are seeking funding for 3 episodes of the ZOMB SQUAD web series. As you know, to do it right, making a television show, film or web series is a costly endeavor, and while we here at ZOMB SQUAD have access to talent, crew and equipment, and a plethora of great ideas, we are all blue collar artists working in the entertainment industry and barely scraping by at times. But this is what we love. And the thing we need most, the thing we have the least access to, is funding. That’s where you come in, Oh IndieGoGoer.
A few years ago, I spent years trying to get a feature film produced. The script was original, funny and unique and we came close a few times, but the funding always fell thru in the end. I put the project back in the drawer and spent the next year shaking my head trying to figure out how to get work produced. I began to write scripts for an original television show and pitched it to producers with the same result. And then, I read something in the back of a tv pilot scriptwriting book that I will never forget. Now, I’m paraphrasing, because its been awhile, but it read something like this: ‘You don’t have the clout to take a script and put it on a producers desk and get it produced. That takes time. You may never get there, but if you don’t try, you’ll never know’. Now I know that was supposed to be uplifting, but what I saw instead was, ‘You don’t have the clout’ and ‘You may never get there…’ and for a guy like me, who loves what I do and the ability to create, the thought that I may never get there or have the clout to make great entertainment, well, it just made me feel dejected. So, I tried to figure out how to gain the clout. And you do that thru the power of the people! 

The most important reason to use Indiegogo, is because I know that throughout this community, there are passionate, stalwart and powerful individuals who are likeminded and who understand the creative urge, and who will help support an organized, creative and well thought out effort to do so. So, what the hell ARE we doing here? Glad you asked! We’ve decided to cut out the middle man and appeal to you, the audience, to give us the clout we need to get the job done. It ain’t rocket science, and it may be just funny lil zombies, but ZOMB SQUAD is an opportunity to take charge of our own careers and make fun, entertaining content that people can get behind! I don’t have the clout to put my script on a producers table and get it made, but collectively, “WE” do!
 
The (Twisted?) Minds Behind The Zomb Squad!

CHRISTIAN STOKES is the creator, head writer, co-director, co-producer of ZOMB SQUAD and will play the role of Sgt. Jake Romero. Christian just returned from touring the US, Canada and Europe last year as the Performance Director for MARVEL UNIVERSE LIVE, the biggest arena stunt show of its kind, featuring the Avengers, Spider-Man, Wolverine and many, many more! 

Christian is no stranger to film and tv, having acted in ESCAPE PLAN with Sylvester Stallone, MONSTER with Charlize Theron, and BERNIE with Matthew McConaughey, just to name a few. He was one of the mutated inbred brothers for the ‘8 Films To Die For’ feature, LAKE DEAD. He has done stunt work for such shows as ALIAS, NO ORDINARY FAMILY, and stunt double to series regular Zac Orth on the popular NBC tv show, REVOLUTION.
See Christian's IMDb page here: http://www.imdb.me/christianstokes
TODD E. BRALEY is the other half of the Dynamic Duo that will co-produce and co-direct the ZOMB SQUAD. Braley is a prolific writer and indie filmmaker that lives in Grand Junction, Colorado, with over 800 various projects, ranging from films to commercials, under his belt. 

Todd is the kind of filmmaker that has an idea, puts a group of driven individuals together and gets it done. His most recent works include THE CONFESSION, RAIN, MISFIT, KILL SHOW and the web series SURVIVING THE UNDEAD.

 Todd just returned from Los Angeles where he directed the video for the first single off the new album from the legendary rock and roll band, Great White. Todd's professionalism, hard work and inspiration are glowing examples of why he is such an essential part of the team. He doesn’t just talk the talk, more importantly, he walks the walk!

Take a look at Todd's Great White music video for the single, ""Big Time"": https://youtu.be/lkDa3spwZJI
 

Who’s Who in the Zomb Squad!
*all character sketches courtesy of illustrator Carlton H. Hoyles.
SGT. JAKE ROMERO (Christian Stokes)

Jake is the leader of the Squad. He is one part Rick Grimes from the Walking Dead, one part Dog the Bounty Hunter, and one part Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty. Romero is a decisive leader, particularly when engaging the undead and he’s been doing it for a long time. He tends to put himself in danger because he has a sense of invulnerability and predestination. Used to date Vasquez once upon an apocalypse. He is the tie that binds them all together.
JESSE “GAF” COOTS (Jesse Van Swol)

Gaf is a gay man trapped in a hairy heterosexual’s bear man body. Somewhat overweight. His homosexuality is non-chalant.  His bitching and constant state of defeatism is not. Always waiting for the other shoe to drop and knows the next apocalypse is right around the corner. Probably rabid alpacas or some other horror or another. Sometimes allows his daughter, Brittany, to join the team on missions for extra credit.
GRIFFON COOTS (Cody Evans-Gan)

Grif is Gaf’s younger brother, and is the best zombie tracker there has ever been. In fact, he eats like a zombie, sleeps like a zombie and breathes like a zombie. In other words, for all intents and purposes, he is pretty much a zombie. Except he ain’t. He doesn’t speak much. Silent but deadly. And, Yep! You guessed it. He smells horrible.
MARVIN MARVINS (TBD)

Marvin is a poor man’s Dave Chapelle. Wiry and quick. Cries alot. On the Squad serving  out his community service. He’d rather be ANY place else. Funny in a crackhead sort of way. Has a thing for Gaf’s daughter Brittany. May be the only thing keeping him from running away screaming. And Griffon makes him nervous…a poopy pants kind of nervous!
BERTHA (Heather Carson)

Bertha is a big boned man hater and master interrogator. She is always in a bad Moo-Moo and in a worse mood. Woke up on the wrong side of bed every single morning. Enjoys whacking men and zombies alike with her bowling ball filled ditty bag! Kind of has the sweets for Griffon, but probably because he keeps his mouth shut. 
Here are a few words from Bertha herself! (Actress Heather Carson)

VASQUEZ (TBD)

Vasquez is in great shape and built for combat! She makes Sarah Connor look like a Sunday school teacher. She is militant and knows how to use every weapon in the book. She can take you out quicker than you can say, “Wanna Netflix and chill?” Bad ass and in control. Hand grenade in one hand and a can of whoop ass in the other. She is to zombies what Rambo was to commies! Yeah, she’s the real muscle of the team!
‘TEXAS’ TIMMY MACK (TBD)

Texas Tim is an OG Zombie Hunter. Tim is wheelchair bound because he cut off both legs after being bitten by a zombie because he didn’t care for needles! No zombie vaccines for Tim! He is the Chuck Norris of the Post-Post Apocalypse! WWTTD! “What Would Texas Tim Do?” The man is a legend. A true cowboys and tough as nails. Likes to play guitar and fire off his shotgun. Some people tell he used to be a famous country and western singer before the world went to hell.

How Can I Join The Squad?
Simple. Take a look at the Top Right of this page at all of our cool and interesting Perks and the dollar amount attached to each. You see something you like, please invest. Because that’s what you are: Investors. And not only will you invest and contribute to the ZOMB SQUAD, but, hey, we get to give something back to you for your investment! We have tried to put our heads together to come up with some cool and unique perks for our backers. And know that every dollar you invest goes into breathing life…or unlife, if you will…into creating the ZOMB SQUAD! 
How much should you invest? Only invest what you can freely give. We have different investment levels and rewards for both individuals and sponsoring corporations. You can only afford $10? Great! That just bought our printer paper for our Zombie Extra release forms. $25? You just helped us buy Sgt. Romero’s bloodstained cowboy hat! $100? You made our SFX guy happy by buying his prosthetics for the celebrity zombies in Episode 3, “Celebrity Zombie Deathmatch!” How bout $1000? Now the Squad gets to chase zombies in style because you just rented their ride for a week, the converted Ice Cream/Ambulance known as ‘Little Boy’, complete with ice cream music serenade! 

If you can’t support us with dollars, we understand! We have been starving artists more than once in our career. If that’s the case, then please get behind us instead with your enthusiasm and moral support. Share us with friends and family and groups on Facebook and Twitter, Instagram and Tinder, and Snapchat and Tumblr…Hmm, I said Tinder didn’t I? Must have been my subconscious showing! Start conversations and mention us around the water cooler and comic shops, in the comic-cons and on those Tinder dates. Let people know how to find us! Get it on til the break of dawn and spread the word! Any and all support, monetary or otherwise, is welcome!

 
What Happens To All That Cash?
I know! $20,000 sure sounds like a lot of cash to me, too! But, believe it or not, for what we are attempting, that figure is on the shallow end of the cemetery when it comes to producing network quality content. And don’t get us wrong! We aim to try to get this show picked up by a network or streaming service at the end of the day, so every dollar counts when it comes to production value. We want to make sure ‘low budget’ isn’t equated with ‘low quality’. 
This is Phase 1 of the funding for ZOMB SQUAD. In this initial crowdfunding campaign, we are trying to find the funds to physically produce the project. This includes travel, production, equipment, SFX, etc. At this time, cast and crew are working for free. Now, being a professional, I believe in paying an honest dollar for an honest day’s work. So, Phase 2 will be geared specifically to pay cast and crew. Finally, Phase 3 will begin after shooting is complete in August and will go towards post-production on the series. The overall budget from all three phases of fundraising will be $50,000.
In Phase 1, we will need to build out our illegal zombie fighting ring location, purchase or create props and wardrobe, rent offices and space for The Kennel (Zomb Squad HQ), as well as convert vehicles into lean mean Zombie Apocalypse Fightin’ Machines! And, because we are keeping crew and production prices down by shooting in Grand Junction, CO and using my co-producer Todd Braley’s team of filmmakers, we will spend the majority of our Phase 1 money on transporting talent into the Colorado wilds and making sure they are housed and well fed.
The breakdown for Phase 1 is as follows:

 
How The Hell Are We Gonna Get To $20K?
It’s not as crazy as you might think! It looks a little something like this!
If we have 100 people invest $25.
50 people invest $50
50 people invest $100
10 people invest $500
5 people invest $1000…
=
$20,000
Phase 1 Complete! We make ZOMB SQUAD and you get some SWAG!!!

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>10 to 6 is, at it's core, an honest portrayal of London life for young people fresh out of education. This particular story features Alex and Becca, two aspiring actors with high expectations and low motivation levels. Our first series explores their first few weeks in the big city, showing us the ups and downs (but mostly downs) of their first attempt at ""adulting.""</p>
<p>My name is Cameron O'Ware, and I'm an acting student from Northampton. 10 to 6 is my first venture into writing, producing and directing (no pressure then) so I am extremely passionate about making this series something beautiful.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows this industry knows how hard it can be to break into, and for all of us involved in 10 to 6, this is us breaking in and leaving our mark - and that's why we need your help!</p>
<p>This is our beginning. This will be just the first project to come from this group of talented, passionate people. It's going to be something special - and you can be a part of that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Are We Asking For?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, making a show is expensive. We've sat down to work out costs and we've come up with £1500 as the bare minimum we need to crowdfund to make this series a reality. That money will go towards;</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment Purchase/Hire - to make it beautiful!</li>
<li>Location Shooting Costs - to make it interesting!</li>
<li>Payment/Travel Costs for Cast &amp; Crew - to make it fair!</li>
<li>Promotion &amp; Advertising - to get it seen!</li>
</ul>
<p>Rest assured we're not just relying on you to cover these costs - we'll also be doing our own fundraising on the side of this campaign which we'll be sure to keep you updated on, so do keep checking back!</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the perks we're offering at the side of this page - who wouldn't want our faces hanging on their bedroom walls!?</p>
<ul></ul>

</div></div>","The Story
10 to 6 is, at it's core, an honest portrayal of London life for young people fresh out of education. This particular story features Alex and Becca, two aspiring actors with high expectations and low motivation levels. Our first series explores their first few weeks in the big city, showing us the ups and downs (but mostly downs) of their first attempt at ""adulting.""
My name is Cameron O'Ware, and I'm an acting student from Northampton. 10 to 6 is my first venture into writing, producing and directing (no pressure then) so I am extremely passionate about making this series something beautiful.
Anyone who knows this industry knows how hard it can be to break into, and for all of us involved in 10 to 6, this is us breaking in and leaving our mark - and that's why we need your help!
This is our beginning. This will be just the first project to come from this group of talented, passionate people. It's going to be something special - and you can be a part of that!

What Are We Asking For?
Unfortunately, making a show is expensive. We've sat down to work out costs and we've come up with £1500 as the bare minimum we need to crowdfund to make this series a reality. That money will go towards;

Equipment Purchase/Hire - to make it beautiful!
Location Shooting Costs - to make it interesting!
Payment/Travel Costs for Cast & Crew - to make it fair!
Promotion & Advertising - to get it seen!

Rest assured we're not just relying on you to cover these costs - we'll also be doing our own fundraising on the side of this campaign which we'll be sure to keep you updated on, so do keep checking back!
Be sure to check out the perks we're offering at the side of this page - who wouldn't want our faces hanging on their bedroom walls!?

<h3>ABOUT PLAIN SIGHT</h3>
<p>PLAIN SIGHT is a dramatic  television series set in Trinidad &amp; Tobago.  Based on the complex relationship between two highly motivated, bright, and ambitious characters that grew up together, only to become arch rivals, since one became a ruthless mafia leader and the other a shrewd forensic scientist/ detective. Both are fighting for what is best for their community, but obviously one’s method is lawful and the other’s is not. They are both in their early 30s. The Mafia leader is James, who has been disillusioned by government policies, sociological prejudice and economic inequalities. Through James we are introduced to a cast of characters that straddle several socio-economic groups.<br/><br/>The detective, Sarah, is a highly educated woman who won a scholarship straight out of high school for a prestigious university in North America. After a tumultuous childhood and some prodding from her father, she left Trinidad and barely looked back. She left Trinidad to further her studies abroad and was snatched up by a foreign CSI and was well on her way to success when she receives a phone call from Trinidad that her sister has been murdered. From that moment, the focus of her life shifts forever and puts her on a direct collision course with James.<br/><br/>The series as a whole, works toward the dramatic climax when Sarah eventually comes face to face with her emotional connection with James, and her sense of morality and justice. As they focus intensely on each other, the people in both their lives must live in the here and now - against the backdrop of a seemingly idyllic island where danger lurks just beneath the surface, and criminals hide in plain sight.</p>

<h3>WHERE WE'RE AT</h3>
<p>We have been actively working on fundraising and production of Plain Sight for over three years. In terms of the specifics, here’s where we’re at:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have almost completed casting the pilot – we will have to make a few last minute replacements as we lost Winston Duke to the Marvel Universe and are on the lookout for a new Police Commissioner (like our country!).</li>
<li>We have plotted out the entire first season with storyline for the next 5 seasons, recognising that these stories are fluid and can change with time and circumstances.</li>
<li>We have completed production on half of the pilot with six more days of shooting to be completed before we move on to editing and scoring.</li>
<li>We have secured partial funding from two large organisations and have been pledged funding by two companies.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED and WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>We need to raise enough money to complete production on the pilot episode of Plain Sight so that we can shop it to the international market. <strong>Our target for this Indiegogo campaign is $35,000 or more.</strong></p>
<p>We have put together what we hope you’ll find to be a great selection of perks and benefits for you, our backers, from streaming links to our hit series, <strong>Westwood Park</strong> to merchandise, acting lessons and walk-on parts in the pilot!  </p>
<p>In addition to the perks currently listed, we will be adding special one-off perks throughout the campaign, so do keep checking back in with us!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The IMPACT</h3>
<p>I have been working on <strong>Plain Sight</strong> for several years now: in terms of developing the story-arc for the series, scripting the pilot, casting the pilot and crewing up, plus extensive fundraising over a period of years. I began shooting the pilot episode in late 2016, but soon hit a major stumbling block: one of my confirmed funders withdrew half its funding after we had completed several days of filming and all our pre-production, which made it impossible to complete production on the pilot. Needless to say this was a devastating blow.<br/><br/>We have been meeting with potential funding partners who will commit to funding the series once we can produce a full pilot. In addition, we already have a distributor in place to sell the series on the international market, but he is unable to do so without at least the pilot episode in hand. So, not wanting to lose him, we have to act now to make sure that the pilot is completed and ready to be sold. So I’ve dusted myself off and am determined to finish the pilot so that it can be shopped regionally and internationally.<br/><br/><i>This is why we must do this crowdfunding campaign now!</i> With your help, we hope to raise US$35,000 or more so that we can work towards completing the pilot and getting it in the hands of our distributor. Ultimately, we need to raise US$100,000 to complete the pilot, so every penny we can get through Indiegogo is a crucial step towards achieving this and we are absolutely determined!  We also believe that hitting our goal on Indiegogo will be an invaluable morale boost to continue pushing to make our fundraising target.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even with a pilot, there is no guarantee that the series will be picked up for production and distribution. However, what I know for sure is that <strong>without a pilot, there is no way that Plain Sight is going to get anywhere</strong>! I also know that I am deeply committed to this project which, when it is made, will be the first dramatic series to  be made in Trinidad in over 10 years!<br/><br/>My experience with <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377287/?ref_=nm_knf_t1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Westwood Park</strong></a> – a series which is now 20 years old and is the most successful Caribbean drama ever made – has taught me that there are large and varied audiences for drama series, and the life of a series is long! Also, having worked in this industry for 30 years now, I know how to pull this off and am certain of my ability to do so well. I continue to push to overcome hurdles with this series, and I'm so grateful for any support you give.  </p>
