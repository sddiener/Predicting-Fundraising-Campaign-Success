Who we are
Angkor Hospital
for Children (AHC) is a non-profit pediatric teaching hospital working in
cooperation with the Cambodian Government to provide free, quality care to
impoverished children in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Since 1999, AHC has provided over 1,000,000 medical treatments, education to thousands of Cambodian health
workers and prevention training to thousands of families. 
What we need 
Our 'show some
heart' campaign aims to raise US$70,000 to provide surgery to 3,900 children, including 43 heart surgery patients, during September to December 2013. All money raised will go directly towards the costs of life-changing operations.
In 2010, thanks to strong relationships with surgical teams in Australia, Singapore, Italy and the
US, AHC began its Open Heart Surgery Program. Prior to this, there were limited options available for poor families with children who suffered from heart disease in Cambodia. Not only do the visiting teams perform complex heart surgeries,
they train our surgeons so that ultimately our Cambodian heart team will be able to perform
these operations unaided. 
AHC is a non-profit organisation that relies on donations from people around the world. We realise our goal is big, but we also think peoples' hearts are big. Especially international supporters, like you. 

Impact 

Currently, we have 1,500 heart patients on our waiting list. By helping raise US$70,000, you will allow AHC to continue to provide life-saving surgery to children from poor families, who without your help may die.
So far in 2013 we have performed 7,871 surgeries.  The impact a minor operation can have on a child is huge - but the impact a heart operation can have is endless. They enable our patients to have a happy and healthy life, allowing them to do the simplest of things like play with friends or go to school . Most importantly they enable our patients to live. 
Support
 Support can also come in many ways like donating money, planning a fundraising event, or sharing news to help spread the word.  On December 1, 2013 we even have lovely supporters from around the world running in the Angkor Wat International Half Marathon as part of 'Team Heart'. Show some heart and donate today to change a child's life.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE MARCH FOR THE CURE – ANN’S ANGELS RAISING MONEY FOR THE PURPLE STRIDE FOUNDATION</h3>
<p>My brother, sister-in-law and I would first like to thank anyone who has taken the time to log onto this campaign, as it's purpose is not only to raise money to the PURPLE STRIDE PANCREATIC CANCER ACTION NETWORK, but most importantly, to RAISE AWARENESS for pancreatic cancer. </p>
<p>PURPOSE: TO RAISE A TOTAL OF $5,000.00 ($3,000 through this website and $2,000 through team Ann’s Angel’s through the Purple Stride Foundation) FOR PANCREATIC CANCER AND PRESENT A CHECK IN THE NAME OF ANN’S ANGELS TO THE PURPLE STRIDE PANCREATIC CANCER ACTION NETWORK SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2012 AT THE BANKATLANTIC CENTER IN SOUTH FLORIDA.<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> ALL FUNDS  COLLECTED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE WILL BE DONATED TO THE PURPLE STRIDE FOUNDATION</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After browsing many other very worthy campaigns in the health section on this site, it is more apparent than ever that we can make a difference and people want to help!! As you can imagine, cancer affects not only the patient, but everyone around them as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE'RE HERE</strong></p>
<p>Our mother was recently diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and the process has been difficult for not only her, but the people who love and care for her. If you don’t know our mother, we can tell you one thing; SHE IS A FIGHTER. Through all the surgeries, doctors’ appointments, treatments, etc., she has maintained a powerful will that goes without parallel. Not to mention, since diagnosed, our mother has elected to be a participant to FIND A CURE FOR PANCREATIC CANCER by engaging in additional medical testing to help find a CURE.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we have put our minds together and decided “if she can do it, so can we!” And so, here we are; myself, my brother and my sister-in-law making a statement that if a Stage IV cancer patient can make a difference for the future, we can do better.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HERE’S HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p>We have started a team, “ANN’S ANGELS” for the PURPLE STRIDE PANCREATIC CANCER ACTION NETWORK SOUTH FLORIDA PANCREATIC CANCER WALK which will take place on SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2012 AT THE BANKATLANTIC CENTER.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p> Hello Indiegogo!</p>
<p><em><strong>About Me</strong></em></p>
<p>  My name is Adam Poland, and I am a 22 year-old college student that currently lives in the small town of Mount Vernon, Texas. I was born on June 17, 1991 in Garland, Texas. I lived there until 2000, when I moved to Mount Vernon, along with my family. All through grade-school, I had an unusual obsession with cars. Everything I read, dreamt, and talked was cars. I put the idea that cars were too expensive into my head, and instead tried sports like skateboarding, BMX-ing, and football throughout my school years. None of these really appealed to me, however. When I graduated high school, I decided that I wanted to do something with cars for the rest of my life. After struggling to find a degree that was right for me for a few years, I decided to become an auto mechanic. As a result, I am attending school as an automotive technician, and will be graduating in May, 2014. I currently have a 4.0 GPA in the field, and will hopefully be graduating with honors. After graduating, I plan on finishing my mechanical engineering degree.</p>
<p><em><strong>From Beginning to End</strong></em></p>
<p>  In 2007, I became involved with a group called The Drivers Edge (<a href=""http://www.thedriversedge.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thedriversedge.net/</a>), a high performance driving school based out of Mount Vernon. My best friend since sixth grade, Trevor Zimmerman, connected me with this group through his mom, who had married the owner of the company. I began driving with The Drivers Edge, and every instructor that I had told me that I had natural talent behind the wheel of a car. I brushed these comments off and jokingly stated that, ""Video games helped I guess."".</p>
<p>  I continued driving with The Drivers Edge, and continually heard these same comments. I finally started to take notice, as did my parents. We decided as a family that it was time to take our first steps into club racing.</p>
<p>  It turns out that getting into club racing was not nearly as easy as one may think. We were given the run-around by multiple people, and were mislead many times. We finally came into contact with a woman named Shannon, who helped us find our way into SCCA Club Racing (Sports Car Club of America,<a href=""http://www.scca.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.scca.com/</a> ).</p>
<p>  2010 rolls around, and we find ourselves at the licensing event at Texas World Speedway for my club racing license in the middle of July. We were dumbfounded as to what we were doing, but were helped along by many of the very friendly people within the world of motorsports. This licensing event consisted of multiple practice races and classroom sessions. After a very hot and tiring weekend, I had my SCCA Club Racing license in my hand, and we had decided that we were going to race in the Spec Miata series of SCCA under the team name of Eastex Motorsports, in a 1991 Mazda Miata.</p>
<p>  The 2010/2011 season was very rough for us, as we were still learning the sport and figuring out how everything worked. I figured out that the competition was very fierce, and that my skills needed further honing that what I had initially thought. I had a few top ten finishes during this season, and fought hard the whole way. Regardless, I ended the season with enough points to compete in the 2011 SCCA National Runoffs at Road America.</p>
<p>  The Runoffs were a completely different story than the National and Regional races I had been attending, and I would be racing them in a new-to-me car, a 1999 Mazda Miata. After learning the car over the week of being at the track, I ended up with a qualifying position of twenty-first. It was not what I was hoping, but I was happy nonetheless. I kept a solid pace, and ended up finishing in tenth place. A top ten finish at my first ever national championship was a big deal to me and my team.</p>
<p>  We went into the 2012 season with much more confidence than we had in the previous season, and we went in ready to go. After multiple team meetings, we decided that we would race with both SCCA and NASA (National Auto Sport Association, <a href=""http://www.nasaproracing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nasaproracing.com/</a>), with the latter being out preference.  We had formed a team by this point that consisted of myself, my mom (Kathy Poland), my dad (Tim Poland), my sister (Leah Poland), and my friend Trevor Zimmerman. Midway through this season, I met a girl who was brought into the team, as we started dating. Her name is Lindsey Davis. This season ended up being a very good season for us, as I ended up third in overall points, and third in the Teen Mazda Challenge.</p>
<p>  The 2013 season is underway, and it is the best yet. My skills, as well as the teams, have increased dramatically, and we are all still together. I have won multiple races this season thus far, and won the Teen Mazda Challenge for the Texas region with a full sweep in points. I am currently third in overall points, but am going for first, as there are still two races left, and the points are close. We plan on attending the NASA National Championship on September 7th.</p>
<p>  <em><strong>Teen Mazda Challenge</strong></em> </p>
<p>  You may have noticed that I mentioned the Teen Mazda Challenge a couple of times, and may be wondering what it is. It is a program that was developed by Mazda for ""teens"" aged 13-22 that gives them an opportunity to make it into the pro ranks. A winner from each NASA region is chosen to compete in a specialized event that is worth $75,000 for them to put toward pro racing in the Playboy MX-5 Cup Series (<a href=""http://www.mx-5cup.com/2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mx-5cup.com/2012/</a>).</p>
<p>  <em><strong>The Next Goal/Proposal</strong></em>   </p>

About Me
  My name is Adam Poland, and I am a 22 year-old college student that currently lives in the small town of Mount Vernon, Texas. I was born on June 17, 1991 in Garland, Texas. I lived there until 2000, when I moved to Mount Vernon, along with my family. All through grade-school, I had an unusual obsession with cars. Everything I read, dreamt, and talked was cars. I put the idea that cars were too expensive into my head, and instead tried sports like skateboarding, BMX-ing, and football throughout my school years. None of these really appealed to me, however. When I graduated high school, I decided that I wanted to do something with cars for the rest of my life. After struggling to find a degree that was right for me for a few years, I decided to become an auto mechanic. As a result, I am attending school as an automotive technician, and will be graduating in May, 2014. I currently have a 4.0 GPA in the field, and will hopefully be graduating with honors. After graduating, I plan on finishing my mechanical engineering degree.
From Beginning to End
  In 2007, I became involved with a group called The Drivers Edge (http://www.thedriversedge.net/), a high performance driving school based out of Mount Vernon. My best friend since sixth grade, Trevor Zimmerman, connected me with this group through his mom, who had married the owner of the company. I began driving with The Drivers Edge, and every instructor that I had told me that I had natural talent behind the wheel of a car. I brushed these comments off and jokingly stated that, ""Video games helped I guess."".
  I continued driving with The Drivers Edge, and continually heard these same comments. I finally started to take notice, as did my parents. We decided as a family that it was time to take our first steps into club racing.
  It turns out that getting into club racing was not nearly as easy as one may think. We were given the run-around by multiple people, and were mislead many times. We finally came into contact with a woman named Shannon, who helped us find our way into SCCA Club Racing (Sports Car Club of America,http://www.scca.com/ ).
  2010 rolls around, and we find ourselves at the licensing event at Texas World Speedway for my club racing license in the middle of July. We were dumbfounded as to what we were doing, but were helped along by many of the very friendly people within the world of motorsports. This licensing event consisted of multiple practice races and classroom sessions. After a very hot and tiring weekend, I had my SCCA Club Racing license in my hand, and we had decided that we were going to race in the Spec Miata series of SCCA under the team name of Eastex Motorsports, in a 1991 Mazda Miata.
  The 2010/2011 season was very rough for us, as we were still learning the sport and figuring out how everything worked. I figured out that the competition was very fierce, and that my skills needed further honing that what I had initially thought. I had a few top ten finishes during this season, and fought hard the whole way. Regardless, I ended the season with enough points to compete in the 2011 SCCA National Runoffs at Road America.
  The Runoffs were a completely different story than the National and Regional races I had been attending, and I would be racing them in a new-to-me car, a 1999 Mazda Miata. After learning the car over the week of being at the track, I ended up with a qualifying position of twenty-first. It was not what I was hoping, but I was happy nonetheless. I kept a solid pace, and ended up finishing in tenth place. A top ten finish at my first ever national championship was a big deal to me and my team.
  We went into the 2012 season with much more confidence than we had in the previous season, and we went in ready to go. After multiple team meetings, we decided that we would race with both SCCA and NASA (National Auto Sport Association, http://www.nasaproracing.com/), with the latter being out preference.  We had formed a team by this point that consisted of myself, my mom (Kathy Poland), my dad (Tim Poland), my sister (Leah Poland), and my friend Trevor Zimmerman. Midway through this season, I met a girl who was brought into the team, as we started dating. Her name is Lindsey Davis. This season ended up being a very good season for us, as I ended up third in overall points, and third in the Teen Mazda Challenge.
  The 2013 season is underway, and it is the best yet. My skills, as well as the teams, have increased dramatically, and we are all still together. I have won multiple races this season thus far, and won the Teen Mazda Challenge for the Texas region with a full sweep in points. I am currently third in overall points, but am going for first, as there are still two races left, and the points are close. We plan on attending the NASA National Championship on September 7th.
  Teen Mazda Challenge 
  You may have noticed that I mentioned the Teen Mazda Challenge a couple of times, and may be wondering what it is. It is a program that was developed by Mazda for ""teens"" aged 13-22 that gives them an opportunity to make it into the pro ranks. A winner from each NASA region is chosen to compete in a specialized event that is worth $75,000 for them to put toward pro racing in the Playboy MX-5 Cup Series (http://www.mx-5cup.com/2012/).
  The Next Goal/Proposal   
  Even though I won the Teen Mazda Challenge, I am still trying to figure out which way to go, and I am leaning towards Pirelli World Challenge (PWC,http://www.world-challenge.com/ ) versus the MX-5 Cup if I can fund it. I believe that this would be a great series to go with for me and my team, as there is national televised coverage of the international series on NBC Sports Network, versus none with the MX-5 Cup. PWC is a much more expensive series than the MX-5 Cup, but the recognition we would get as a team would be so much more.
  The car we are looking into running is a 2012 Mazda MX-5 in the Touring Car class. A typical season in Pirelli World Challenge costs around $400,000 for everything for a full year. I am sending out sponsorship proposals to companies and trying to raise money to be able to afford it. I've always believed that if you put your mind to it, you can do it. 
  World Challenge Vision offers a marketing sponsorship package thst includes the following:
- One set of four PWC Pirelli Racing Slicks
-90 seconds of in car coverage
-90 seconds of NBCSports/WCTV televised broadcast coverage
-One four color full page ad in the World Challenge Fan Guide

-Custom hi resolution 27"" x 20"" print of the years action shots for driver/team or sponsor

<p>In December 2011 Ariella was diagnosed with Lyme disease.  This was after 13 years of unexplained illnesses and misdiagnoses.  One main illness brought this whole thing to a head.  In August 2011 Ariella had a Laparoscopy and it was discovered she had a very large cyst on her left Fallopian Tube.  It was removed and things were supposed to get better.  Ariella did not get better as she started her senior year in September.  She became more sick and there were days when she could not stand, walk or hold a pencil.  The pain was unbearable for her.  She had extreme joint/muscle pain, heart palpitations, twitching muscles, extreme headaches, numbness, poor balance, burning and stabbing sensations throughout her body, and many more symptoms.  She missed many days of school.  Fortunately Ariella's Algebra teacher knew of Lyme disease and insisted that Ariella get tested.  It turned out that Ariella did have Lyme disease. </p>
<p><strong>About Lyme Disease</strong></p>
<p>This was all very confusing, frustrating and scary.  To find out that there were 2 types of Lyme disease (acute and chronic) and that only acute was recognized by the IDSA (Infectious Diseases Society of America).  Due to the IDSA Guidelines, Chronic Lyme or Late Stage Lyme is not recognized by the medical community and is dismissed.  It all comes down to medical establishments being corrupted by corporate interests and being linked with big pharma and insurance companies.  You can watch the documentary ""Under Our Skin"" and learn more.  Acute Lyme is treated with a short course of antibiotics but if it isnt caught, it becomes a whole different story.  A deadly bacterium that takes over the whole body.  It's often compared to Syphilis due to the spirochete form.  Lyme spreads throughout the entire body and has the capacity to hide from antibiotic treatments, your own antibodies and immune system.  It goes into your heart, eyes, joints and brain and protects itself with a shield (bio-film). </p>
<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately there are many supplements and herbs that can help break down this bio-film while being treated with aggressive antibiotic therapy.  We did find a naturopath who is Lyme literate and he has been treating Ariella with antibiotics for almost 10 months now.  The other part of the treatment is many supplements.  One of the supplements help break down the bio-film so the antibiotics have a better chance at killing the Lyme bacteria.  She takes probiotics to help her fight Candida from long term antibiotic use, and many other supplements to help replace important vitamins and minerals that are depleted while on antibiotics.  </p>
<p>These supplements cost about $400 a month and they are not covered by insurance.  We do not have the money for these supplements anymore and we have depleted all of our financial resources.  Your help is greatly needed in this situation.  We are trying to keep her from having a PICC line (tubing that goes in the arm and travels to just above the heart)  This is for intravenous antibiotics.  If we can continue the supplements with the oral antibiotics, we have a better chance at beating this.  </p>
<p>I am very proud to say that Ariella did graduate from high school while battling this horrible disease.  Watching my daughter walk across that stage was one of the happiest moments in my life.  It took a lot of help and understanding from her teachers but she did it.  We appreciate any help we can get so this beautiful and talented young lady can get on with her life and do the wonderful things that she was intended to do.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just cant make a financial contribution and we completely understand this.  There are other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about this campaign to help Ariella continue treatment.</li>
<li>Be aware of ticks when you are out and about.  Be very vigilant and if you are bitten by a tick, get treated immediately.</li>
<li>Educate yourself about Lyme disease so that you may help others.  You never know when you might be able to help someone. If Ariella's Algebra teacher had never told Ariella to get tested for Lyme we would still be trying to figure out what was wrong with her.</li>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR WHY?</span></strong></p>
<p>I believe we are fortunate, when if at some point in our lives we realize, that we have been given an opportunity to serve a higher purpose. We at <strong>Build-Win 4 Life</strong> feel we have been given just such an opportunity! Over one million Americans will die from Cardio Vascular disease in the next 12 months. That is like a tragic 9/11 happening each and every day!</p>
<p>What was shocking to me as we researched this project was: 1) Cardiovascular disease is the # 1 cause of death in America 2) More women than men die each year from Cardiovascular disease 3) Female deaths from Cardiovascular disease dwarf all other causes of death (including breast cancer) and 4) Deaths from Cardiovascular disease are greater than the NEXT 9 LEADING causes of death in America <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">COMBINED!</span></strong>  The sad part is it doesn't have to be that way! The amino acid L-Arginine when taken in combination with other anti-oxidants and vitamins is proven to increase Nitric Oxide (<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span>) in our blood stream. Dr. Louis Ignarro won the 1998 Nobel Prize for medicine for his ground breaking research of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span> in our system. His research determined that sufficient <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span> can prevent and even reverse hardening of the arteries, elevated cholesterol levels and hyper-tension (high blood pressure) among many other health benefits.</p>
<p>Folks, let’s stop believing that the pharmaceutical industry has a<strong> “pill for every ill”</strong>. In most cases, engineered drugs only ""mask"" the symptoms and never address the CAUSE. <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NOTE:</span></strong> We don't recommend stopping any medications, we encourage supplementing with this amazing product, then when your symptoms are improved, your Doctor will likely ask how and then suggest that you no longer need your blood pressure and/or cholesterol medications! It is documented to have happened tens of thousands of times! Your contribution large or small will go a long way towards helping us improve people’s health!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR PRODUCT</span></strong></p>
<p>Our daily supplement was formulated by Dr. Harry Elwardt. Dr. Elwardt is a Naturopathic Doctor, Master Herbalist, Certified Nutritional Counselor, PhD in Health and Nutrition and the author of “Let’s Stop The # 1 Killer of Americans Today!”.</p>
<p>Over 84,000 medically published, peer reviewed, independent clinical tests dating back over 30 years have proven that L-Arginine converts to Nitric Oxide in our blood vessels and increased Nitric Oxide will help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Blood Pressure</li>
<li>Lower Cholesterol</li>
<li>Improve Diabetes</li>
<li>Improve Sexual Function</li>
<li>Reduce Blood Clots&amp; Strokes</li>
<li>Improve Wound Healing</li>
<li>Improve Kidney Function</li>
<li>Improve Memory</li>
<li>Improve Sleep</li>
<li>Increase Energy</li>
</ul><p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">It is a pretty safe bet that most all of us see ourselves on that list somewhere.</span></strong></p>
<p>Please take a moment to review the attached document; “22 Reasons to Supplement with Arginine”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHO NEEDS TO SUPPLEMENT?</span></strong></p>
<p>While proteins help our bodies naturally produce Nitric Oxide (<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span>), with the nutrient deficient food chain that is now our reality, the body simply does not produce enough <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span> to provide all of the amazing benefits that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span> provides.           L-Arginine taken as a daily supplement, boosts our body’s production of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">NO</span>. Cardiovascular symptoms and diabetes are showing up in our population, more and more, at alarmingly young ages. We believe that almost everyone in America over the age of 20 should be supplementing with L-Arginine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">CONSUMER AWARENESS</span></strong></p>
<p>While Build-Win4Life is certainly not the only company marketing this type of product, it is our intent to be the largest messenger for this product and its health benefits. Our customers quickly become passionate about supplementing with Arginine and begin to tell everyone they know and love. It is this passion that will help us to reach a massive market. Our customers can, and most do, become Preferred Customers and couple their passion with an income (through our Referral Rewards Program). This combined with the fact that we believe we are the best priced, most nutritionally packed product available today will drive our success!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">YOUR CONTRIBUTION</span></strong></p>
<p>We need to finish some upgrades to our website and our sales tracking software. We also need to create and print additional marketing materials and we desire to re-stock inventory at a volume purchase to allow us to reduce our per unit cost. With our current and projected member/sales growth we feel that this cash infusion will give us the solid foundation necessary to carry our message of good health and improved wealth to the masses!</p>

Dr. Louis Ignarro won the 1998 Nobel Prize for medicine for his ground breaking research of NO in our system. His research determined that sufficient NO can prevent and even reverse hardening of the arteries, elevated cholesterol levels and hyper-tension (high blood pressure) among many other health benefits.
Folks, let’s stop believing that the pharmaceutical industry has a “pill for every ill”. In most cases, engineered drugs only ""mask"" the symptoms and never address the CAUSE. NOTE: We don't recommend stopping any medications, we encourage supplementing with this amazing product, then when your symptoms are improved, your Doctor will likely ask how and then suggest that you no longer need your blood pressure and/or cholesterol medications! It is documented to have happened tens of thousands of times! Your contribution large or small will go a long way towards helping us improve people’s health!
 
OUR PRODUCT
Our daily supplement was formulated by Dr. Harry Elwardt. Dr. Elwardt is a Naturopathic Doctor, Master Herbalist, Certified Nutritional Counselor, PhD in Health and Nutrition and the author of “Let’s Stop The # 1 Killer of Americans Today!”.
Over 84,000 medically published, peer reviewed, independent clinical tests dating back over 30 years have proven that L-Arginine converts to Nitric Oxide in our blood vessels and increased Nitric Oxide will help:

Lower Blood Pressure
Lower Cholesterol
Improve Diabetes
Improve Sexual Function
Reduce Blood Clots& Strokes
Improve Wound Healing
Improve Kidney Function
Improve Memory
Improve Sleep
Increase Energy
It is a pretty safe bet that most all of us see ourselves on that list somewhere.
Please take a moment to review the attached document; “22 Reasons to Supplement with Arginine”.
 
WHO NEEDS TO SUPPLEMENT?
While proteins help our bodies naturally produce Nitric Oxide (NO), with the nutrient deficient food chain that is now our reality, the body simply does not produce enough NO to provide all of the amazing benefits that NO provides.           L-Arginine taken as a daily supplement, boosts our body’s production of NO. Cardiovascular symptoms and diabetes are showing up in our population, more and more, at alarmingly young ages. We believe that almost everyone in America over the age of 20 should be supplementing with L-Arginine.
 
CONSUMER AWARENESS
While Build-Win4Life is certainly not the only company marketing this type of product, it is our intent to be the largest messenger for this product and its health benefits. Our customers quickly become passionate about supplementing with Arginine and begin to tell everyone they know and love. It is this passion that will help us to reach a massive market. Our customers can, and most do, become Preferred Customers and couple their passion with an income (through our Referral Rewards Program). This combined with the fact that we believe we are the best priced, most nutritionally packed product available today will drive our success!
YOUR CONTRIBUTION
We need to finish some upgrades to our website and our sales tracking software. We also need to create and print additional marketing materials and we desire to re-stock inventory at a volume purchase to allow us to reduce our per unit cost. With our current and projected member/sales growth we feel that this cash infusion will give us the solid foundation necessary to carry our message of good health and improved wealth to the masses!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>

<p>But the best part of running is going to races and feeling a sense of comradery I've longed for my whole life (maybe from being an only child). But races are EXPENSIVE.

<p>Eric and I discovered over the years, we should have met numerous times but the fates decided we weren’t supposed to be together until 2004. Our first date was one I will never forget, Eric took me to the driving range. He nestles behind me in order to show me how to swing the club and in true “caveman” style he hit me over the head.

<p>We knew from the very beginning children were our future but we had a cloud of doubt hanging over our heads.

But we were optimistic, we knew it would happen.</p>
<p>November 13, 2010 Eric and I tied the knot and made the executive decision to seek medical help for my infertility, immediately. We had saved some money over the years, thinking we would only need to take a pill or two and we would have our baby. No such luck, after a year of fertility treatments, ranging from Clomid to injectables, we still were not able to conceive. It was devastating to the both of us. We had been so confident that we would overcome the odds that failure never even crossed our minds.</p>
<p>The next step is IVF, the doctor has told us that I am a great candidate for it but as we all know, this procedure is pretty expensive. I understand times are fiscally rough for everyone and we thank you so much for even considering helping us.</p>

Our History
Camping became a cornerstone of YMCA programming in 1885 when the YMCA started Camp Dudley, America’s first known summer camp program, at Orange Lake, N.Y. The nation’s longest continually operating camp, its aim was to provide children with a positive developmental experience through making new friends, building confidence and growing in self-reliance.
In 1957, the Camp Orange opened its second location, Camp Isis, a day camp companion for children too young to participate in sleep-away camp at the original site down the road in Walden, NY. In the 1960’s the camp was renamed to become Camp Robbins. YMCA’s Camp Robbins has continued to grow and serve tens of thousands of families from Orange, Dutchess, Ulster and surrounding counties.
From its historic beginnings to today, Camp Robbins and the YMCA of Dutchess and Eastern Orange have been dedicated to working side-by-side with our neighbors to make sure that everyone, regardless of age, income or background, has the opportunity to learn, grow and thrive. 
The YMCA of Dutchess and Eastern Orange has been listening and responding to our communities’ most critical social needs for 160 years. Whether developing skills or emotional well-being through education and training, welcoming and connecting diverse demographic populations, or building healthier communities by building collaborations, the Y fosters the care and respect all people need and deserve.
The YMCA will rebuild at Camp Robbins so that future generations can learn the core values that we believe are vital to empowering their future - Caring, Honesty, Respect and Responsibility  helping them to be caring and competent adults who are positive contributors to their community.
We humbly ask for your assistance in helping us to do so.
While we know that insurance will cover a good deal of the expense, there are upgrades to the building - to ensure that it will need the current and future needs for camp and the community- that will not be covered. Every dollar we raise in support of rebuilding will help enhance the services we can provide.
How your gift changes lives
Each year, thousands of children's lives are impacted as a result of Camp Robbins and its programs. Here are just a few examples from the past summer:
•One little boy with severe autism who wasn’t communicating verbally with anyone except his family, was speaking to campers and staff by the end of the season. 
 •A young girl who cried inconsolably the first day of camp because her parents were leaving her then cried the last day because she had to leave camp and go back to school. 
 •For three years, one young camper could not overcome her fear of climbing the high ropes despite repeated attempts every summer. This summer, with the support and encouragement of camp staff, she made it all the way through the course. She told the staff, “Now I know I can do anything if I just keep trying.” 
These moments are just a small glimpse of the big things that can happen in a child’s life because of your support. And that is why we, on behalf of the children we serve and their families, are grateful for your generosity.
Donors like you help make our camp programs possible, ensuring that these kids have an enriching summer experience that focus on four core values: Caring, Honesty, Respect and Responsibility.

Ilyen például a Crohn-betegség, a szklerózis multiplex, daganatos betegségek, de sokak szenvedését szüntettük már meg a Jinjutsu segítségével, akik lelki gondokkal, cukorbetegséggel, gerincproblémákkal fordultak hozzánk. <b>Gyakorlatilag a legtöbb fizikai és lelki betegség gyógyítható a Jinjutsu által.</b> Módszerünkkel állatokat is kezeltünk már sikerrel.

<b>Betegeinket adományért kezeljük</b>, mert szeretnénk, hogy a Jinjutsu általi gyógyulás mindenki számára elérhető legyen. Ugyanakkor legtöbb betegünk nem tud kezelésenként akkora adományt adni, amelyből gyógyítóink szerény megélhetése és a kezelőhely fenntartása biztosított lenne. A hozzánk fordulók sokszor munkanélküliek, rokkantnyugdíjasok, vagy olyan
 súlyos betegek, akik megtakarításaikat orvosokra, gyógyszerekre 
költötték. Ezért <b>jelképesen száz kezelés árát szeretnénk ebben a kampányban összegyűjteni, amelyből a rászoruló betegek adományait egészítjük ki.</b> Statisztikáink szerint egy beteg átlagosan 20 kezelés után gyógyul meg, így ez a száz kezelés öt rászoruló beteg gyógyulását jelenti. <br/><br/>Hihetetlen öröm látni, amikor valaki egy kezelést követően csillogó szemmel kel fel, vagy amikor beszámol apró javulásokról, a fájdalom csökkenéséről, új dolgokról, amit véghezvitt. Látni, ahogyan napról napra kisimul az arca és szemeibe visszaköltözik az élet. <b>Minden kezelés alatt apró csodák történnek.</b> Mi szeretnénk, hogy ez továbbra is bárki számára elérhető legyen Budapesten, és megköszönünk minden hozzájárulást ehhez! :)<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1408206/files/20150423022503-Szondi_utca_esemeny.jpg?1429781103"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h2>Mire költjük a pénzt?<br/>
</h2>Most körülbelül 400 ezer Ft-ot 
szeretnénk összegyűjteni, amelyet gyógyítóink megélhetésére, 
kezelőhelyeink fenntartására és a Közösség adminisztratív költségeire 
(bankköltség, könyvelő, fordítás japánról, stb.) szeretnénk költeni. 
Főállású gyógyítóink egy hónapban körülbelül 170 ezer forintból 
él(né)nek meg, a kezelőhelyek költségeit is beleszámítva. A kezelésekért
 adományként kapott összeg ennél alacsonyabb, így ezt fogjuk 
kiegészíteni a most gyűjtött összeggel, így biztosítva, hogy a Jinjutsu 
folyamatosan elérhető maradjon a budapestiek számára, gyógyítóink 
továbbra is főállásban a betegekkel foglalkozhassanak. <br/><br/>Az 
indiegogo lehetővé teszi, hogy akkor is megkapjuk a gyűjtött pénzt, ha 
nem érjük el a célként kitűzött összeget (bár ez esetben magasabb jutalékot von le). <b>Minden támogatást a 
betegkezelésre és az adminisztratív költségekre fogunk fordítani.</b><br/><br/>Támogatóinknak
 szeretnénk ajándékokkal kedveskedni, amelyeket az oldal jobb oldalán 
választhatnak ki. Az ajándékokat május és június folyamán kézbesítjük. <b>Minden támogatónk hozzáférést kap egy bloghoz, amelyben napi munkánkról, az apró csodákról írunk. </b>Május 31-én, a kampányunk utolsó hetében egy pikniket is tartunk, amire szeretettel várunk minden (leendő) támogatót. Itt megismerkedhettek gyógyítóinkkal, feltehetitek kérdéseiteket. A pontos, időpontot, helyszínt később tesszük közzé.<br/><br/><h2>Részletek</h2>
<p>Főállású gyógyítónk jobban fizető állásaikat hagyták ott azért, hogy teljes munkaidőben csak a Jinjutsuval foglalkozhassanak. Mivel egy kezelés körülbelül másfél órás, és egy súlyos betegnek akár napi szinten is szüksége lehet a kezelésre, munka mellett nehéz is lenne több beteget kezelni. Nekünk ez lett az életünk, minden nehézség mellett sokkal fontosabb az a szépség, amikor valaki egyszerűen <b>jobban lesz</b>. Bármilyen értelemben. Megkönnyebbül, csökkennek a fájdalmai, javul a mozgása, ki tud mondani valamit, helyreáll az emésztése, megnyugszik. Békésebben távozik tőlünk, és ezt a békét viszi magával a világban.</p>

Korábban buddhista egyházként működtünk, jogosultak voltunk az egyházaknak felajánlható 1% gyűjtésére, ám a jelenlegi kormány megfosztott ezektől a jogainktól és jelenleg csak civil szervezetként gyűjthetjük a felajánlásokat, amivel a korábban gyűjtött összegek töredéke érhető csak el. Ezért kell más finanszírozási formákat keresnünk, hogy kiegészítsük betegeink adományait. Strasbourgban pert indítottunk a kormány ellen egyházi jogaink visszaállítása érdekében, amely eredményeképpen kártérítést ítélt meg nekünk az Európai Bíróság. Ám ennek összegéről nekünk kell megegyeznünk a kormánnyal, kifizetése még sokáig elhúzódhat. Az állam azóta is sok módon nehezíti meg a dolgunkat, legutóbb a közhasznú státuszától is megfosztotta egyesületünket, és a kártérítési perben sem tárgyaltak velünk korrekten. Ez nagyon sok plusz feladatot ró gyógyítóinkra, sőt, még külföldön élő Tanítóinkra is, és rányomja a bélyegét Közösségünk működésére.<br/><br/>Gyógyítóink számára a Jinjutsu szellemi út is, amelyen Tanítóink segítenek minket. Azt tanultuk, hogy <b>minden nehézség egyben lehetőség a fejlődésre</b>, minden, a Közösért tett erőfeszítés visszatér hozzánk, jobbá válhatunk általuk. Így próbáljuk a jelen helyzetet is lehetőségnek tekinteni, próbálunk a magunk részéről mindent megtenni, hogy a betegkezelést fent tudjuk tartani, és erőfeszítéseink által jobb gyógyítókká válhassunk.<br/><br/><b>Kérünk, ha szeretnéd támogatni munkánkat, ha szeretnéd, hogy ez a gyönyörű módszer továbbra is elérhető legyen a betegek számára Budapesten, akkor támogass minket.</b><br/><br/><h2>Technikai részletek</h2>

healing""), which can help attain<b>full recovery even from
conditions that are normally regarded as incurable</b>. These
include Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, tumors, etc. We have also been
able to end the suffering of many who sought our help with psychological issues,
diabetes, or spinal problems. <b>In fact,
most psychological or physical illnesses can be healed with the help of Jinjutsu.</b>
We have also treated animals successfully using this method. </p>
<p>We treat patients in return for donations
because we would like healing by Jinjutsu to be available to everybody.
However, most of our patients are unable to give for each treatment a donation
big enough to ensure even a modest livelihood for our healers and to maintain
the treating centers. Many of our patients are without a job, on disability
pension, or severely ill, having spent their savings on doctors and
medications. We have therefore launched this campaign aiming to collect enough money
<b>to symbolically cover the costs of a
hundred treatments, which we would use to supplement donations from patients in
need.</b> According to our statistics, it takes 20 treatments for a patient to be
healed on average, so this hundred treatments would mean the recovery of five
needy persons.</p>
<p>It is incredibly pleasing to see somebody get
up from the treating table with glittering eyes, or to hear them tell about small
improvements in their condition, the easing of their pain, or things they have
done that they couldn’t before; to see their faces smoothing out day by day and
life returning into their eyes. <b>Tiny
miracles happen during every treatment.</b> We would like this to remain
available to every one in Budapest and will be thankful for every <span>penny donated towards
this aim. </span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h2><b>What will we spend the money on?<br/>
</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>We are aiming to raise 400,000 forints to cover
the livelihood of our healers, the maintenance of our treatment centers, and
the administrative costs of our community (banking and bookkeeping expenses,
translations from Japanese, etc). Our healers (would) need about 170,000
forints a month each to support themselves and the treatment centers. The money
we collect from patient donations is less than that and would therefore be
supplemented with the funds raised, thus ensuring that Jinjutsu continues to be
available to Budapest residents and that our healers can treat patients on a
full-time basis.</p>
<p>Indiegogo enables us to receive the money
raised even if we the sum collected is less than the target (although in this
case a higher fee will be deducted). <b>All
funds donated will be spent on treating patients and administrative costs.</b> </p>
<p>Our donors will be presented with gifts (perks)
that they can select on the right hand side of the page. The gifts will be
delivered in May and June. <b>Every contributor receives access to our blog in which we write about our daily work, the everyday miracles.</b> On May 31st, in the last week of the campaign, we
will be holding a picnic to which all (would-be) supporters will be welcome. It
will give you a chance to meet us healers and ask any questions you may have.
The exact time and place will be announced later on.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h2><b>Details</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Our full-time healers have left better-paid
jobs to practice Jinjutsu on a full-time basis. Since a treatment session lasts
about one and a half hours and severely ill patients may need a session every
day, it would be difficult to treat several patients a day while holding
another job. Healing has become our life: despite every difficulty, it’s much
more important for us to see the beauty of ill people getting simply <b>better</b>, in any sense of the word. They
are relieved, they are able to speak out, their pain is eased, they walk more
easily, their digestion is back to normal, they are calmer. They are more
peaceful when they leave, and they spread this peace in the world.</p>
<p>It would be great for us to be able to focus on
healing all day, but our community is small and we can’t afford to pay professionals.
Hence, we healers deal with the official and financial affairs of the community,
arrange internet presentations and take care of most administrative matters
ourselves.</p>
<p><b>Unfortunately, our activity is being made increasingly difficult in
Hungary nowadays: </b>we need to spend more and more time running to
offices, making phone calls, negotiating. In the past, we used to operate as a
Buddhist chuch and were so entitled to collect so-called ˝1 %˝ Personal Income
Tax donations as a church, but the current govenrment has deprived us of the
church status and, hence, this right. As a result, we can only receive such
donations as an NGO, whereby only a fraction of the sum previously gathered is achievable
because there are much more NGO’s in Hungary competing for these donations than
churches. Hence the need to seek alternative sources of funding to supplement
our patients’ donations. We have started a lawsuit against the government in
Strasbourg in order to have our church status restored, which we have won: the
Strasbourg court has awarded compensation to us. The amount of the compensation,
however, is? yet to be determined through a series of negotiations with the
government, so it may take quite a while before they are paid. The government
has been finding other ways to make our life more difficult ever since: it has also
stripped us of our public benefit organization status, and has not been fair and
decent towards us during the negotiations either. This has imposed many extra
tasks on our healers and even our Teachers living abroad, and left its mark on
the operation of our Community. </p>
<p>To our healers, Jinjutsu is also a spiritual path,
on which our Teachers help us along. We have been taught that <b>every difficulty presents an opportunity
for us to grow</b>, and that every effort made for the Community returns to us
and makes us better. We therefore try to consider the current situation as such
an opportunity and to do everything we can to continue treating patients and to
become, through these efforts, better healers.</p>
<p><b>If you would like to aid our work and help this beautiful way of healing
continue to be available to the patients in Budapest, please support us. </b></p>

</div><br/></div>","(Please scroll down for English version.)Közösségünk 2008 óta kezel betegeket a Jinjutsu nevű japán módszerrel, amellyel akár gyógyíthatatlannak tekintett betegségek esetén is elérhető a teljes gyógyulás. Ilyen például a Crohn-betegség, a szklerózis multiplex, daganatos betegségek, de sokak szenvedését szüntettük már meg a Jinjutsu segítségével, akik lelki gondokkal, cukorbetegséggel, gerincproblémákkal fordultak hozzánk. Gyakorlatilag a legtöbb fizikai és lelki betegség gyógyítható a Jinjutsu által. Módszerünkkel állatokat is kezeltünk már sikerrel. Néhány esetismertetésünket itt találod (görgess egy kicsit lejjebb a konkrét esetekért!), statisztikáink összefoglalóját pedig itt.

Betegeinket adományért kezeljük, mert szeretnénk, hogy a Jinjutsu általi gyógyulás mindenki számára elérhető legyen. Ugyanakkor legtöbb betegünk nem tud kezelésenként akkora adományt adni, amelyből gyógyítóink szerény megélhetése és a kezelőhely fenntartása biztosított lenne. A hozzánk fordulók sokszor munkanélküliek, rokkantnyugdíjasok, vagy olyan
 súlyos betegek, akik megtakarításaikat orvosokra, gyógyszerekre 
költötték. Ezért jelképesen száz kezelés árát szeretnénk ebben a kampányban összegyűjteni, amelyből a rászoruló betegek adományait egészítjük ki. Statisztikáink szerint egy beteg átlagosan 20 kezelés után gyógyul meg, így ez a száz kezelés öt rászoruló beteg gyógyulását jelenti. Hihetetlen öröm látni, amikor valaki egy kezelést követően csillogó szemmel kel fel, vagy amikor beszámol apró javulásokról, a fájdalom csökkenéséről, új dolgokról, amit véghezvitt. Látni, ahogyan napról napra kisimul az arca és szemeibe visszaköltözik az élet. Minden kezelés alatt apró csodák történnek. Mi szeretnénk, hogy ez továbbra is bárki számára elérhető legyen Budapesten, és megköszönünk minden hozzájárulást ehhez! :)
Mire költjük a pénzt?
Most körülbelül 400 ezer Ft-ot 
szeretnénk összegyűjteni, amelyet gyógyítóink megélhetésére, 
kezelőhelyeink fenntartására és a Közösség adminisztratív költségeire 
(bankköltség, könyvelő, fordítás japánról, stb.) szeretnénk költeni. 
Főállású gyógyítóink egy hónapban körülbelül 170 ezer forintból 
él(né)nek meg, a kezelőhelyek költségeit is beleszámítva. A kezelésekért
 adományként kapott összeg ennél alacsonyabb, így ezt fogjuk 
kiegészíteni a most gyűjtött összeggel, így biztosítva, hogy a Jinjutsu 
folyamatosan elérhető maradjon a budapestiek számára, gyógyítóink 
továbbra is főállásban a betegekkel foglalkozhassanak. Az 
indiegogo lehetővé teszi, hogy akkor is megkapjuk a gyűjtött pénzt, ha 
nem érjük el a célként kitűzött összeget (bár ez esetben magasabb jutalékot von le). Minden támogatást a 
betegkezelésre és az adminisztratív költségekre fogunk fordítani.Támogatóinknak
 szeretnénk ajándékokkal kedveskedni, amelyeket az oldal jobb oldalán 
választhatnak ki. Az ajándékokat május és június folyamán kézbesítjük. Minden támogatónk hozzáférést kap egy bloghoz, amelyben napi munkánkról, az apró csodákról írunk. Május 31-én, a kampányunk utolsó hetében egy pikniket is tartunk, amire szeretettel várunk minden (leendő) támogatót. Itt megismerkedhettek gyógyítóinkkal, feltehetitek kérdéseiteket. A pontos, időpontot, helyszínt később tesszük közzé.Részletek
Főállású gyógyítónk jobban fizető állásaikat hagyták ott azért, hogy teljes munkaidőben csak a Jinjutsuval foglalkozhassanak. Mivel egy kezelés körülbelül másfél órás, és egy súlyos betegnek akár napi szinten is szüksége lehet a kezelésre, munka mellett nehéz is lenne több beteget kezelni. Nekünk ez lett az életünk, minden nehézség mellett sokkal fontosabb az a szépség, amikor valaki egyszerűen jobban lesz. Bármilyen értelemben. Megkönnyebbül, csökkennek a fájdalmai, javul a mozgása, ki tud mondani valamit, helyreáll az emésztése, megnyugszik. Békésebben távozik tőlünk, és ezt a békét viszi magával a világban.

Jó lenne csak a gyógyításra koncentrálni egész nap, de közösségünk kicsi, és nincs pénzünk szakembereket megfizetni, így a hivatalos ügyeket, a pénzügyeket, az internetes megjelenéseket és a legtöbb adminisztrációt is mi, gyógyítók intézzük. Sajnos ma Magyarországon egyre inkább megnehezítik a tevékenységünket, egyre többet kell hivatalokba szaladgálnunk, telefonálgatnunk, tárgyalnunk. Korábban buddhista egyházként működtünk, jogosultak voltunk az egyházaknak felajánlható 1% gyűjtésére, ám a jelenlegi kormány megfosztott ezektől a jogainktól és jelenleg csak civil szervezetként gyűjthetjük a felajánlásokat, amivel a korábban gyűjtött összegek töredéke érhető csak el. Ezért kell más finanszírozási formákat keresnünk, hogy kiegészítsük betegeink adományait. Strasbourgban pert indítottunk a kormány ellen egyházi jogaink visszaállítása érdekében, amely eredményeképpen kártérítést ítélt meg nekünk az Európai Bíróság. Ám ennek összegéről nekünk kell megegyeznünk a kormánnyal, kifizetése még sokáig elhúzódhat. Az állam azóta is sok módon nehezíti meg a dolgunkat, legutóbb a közhasznú státuszától is megfosztotta egyesületünket, és a kártérítési perben sem tárgyaltak velünk korrekten. Ez nagyon sok plusz feladatot ró gyógyítóinkra, sőt, még külföldön élő Tanítóinkra is, és rányomja a bélyegét Közösségünk működésére.Gyógyítóink számára a Jinjutsu szellemi út is, amelyen Tanítóink segítenek minket. Azt tanultuk, hogy minden nehézség egyben lehetőség a fejlődésre, minden, a Közösért tett erőfeszítés visszatér hozzánk, jobbá válhatunk általuk. Így próbáljuk a jelen helyzetet is lehetőségnek tekinteni, próbálunk a magunk részéről mindent megtenni, hogy a betegkezelést fent tudjuk tartani, és erőfeszítéseink által jobb gyógyítókká válhassunk.Kérünk, ha szeretnéd támogatni munkánkat, ha szeretnéd, hogy ez a gyönyörű módszer továbbra is elérhető legyen a betegek számára Budapesten, akkor támogass minket.Technikai részletek
Az
 indiegogo oldalán bárki hozzájárulhat betegeink gyógyulásához, 
bármekkora összeggel, elektronikus fizetés útján. Mivel forintban ezen 
az oldalon nem lehet 
gyűjteni, euróban adtuk meg az adományok összegét. Egy euró körülbelül 
300 forintot ér, ezzel lehet számolni. Ha jobb oldalon a ""Contribute 
now"" feliratú nagy rózsaszín gombot választod, máris átirányít az 
adományozási oldalra. Az adományozáshoz be kell jelentkezned, de ezt megteheted facebook profiloddal is. Ha ajándékot is szeretnél választani, akkor itt az
 ""Add perk"" feliratra kell kattintani, kiválasztani a megfelelő összeget
 és a ""Continue to payment"" gombot megnyomni. Ezt követően az adatok 
ellenőrzése után a ""Go to PayPal"" gomb megnyomása átirányít a PayPal 
oldalára, ahol jobb oldalon választható a PayPal számlával való fizetés,
 illetve lentebb a bankkártyával történő fizetés. Az oldalak részletes leírását itt találod.

Gym Bundle: 1 Initial Personal Training session with Janine or one of Park Fitness' awesome trainers + 50% off 1 month Gym membership!

The Impact
This gym is for local members of the community.  I believe it's extremely important to have a gym in close proximity to your home to make attending on a regular basis possible. With your help, I can bring this dream to life! I plan to open the doors at the end of September.
Risks & Challenges
 We have already signed the lease and  have been working on getting open! There are a thousand little stressors and unforeseen things that arise. Making any contribution big or small is greatly appreciated to soften the blow.
Having years of experience  as a successful self employed personal trainer and 2.5 years of owning a  fitness studio, I'm confident I have the resilience, sound business plan and proper support network to overcome any hurdle that will arise.

Other Ways You Can Help

One of my biggest challenges is getting the word out there about the new gym! If you're really excited about this gym and you aren't in a position to donate, just sharing this post and spreading the word to others is greatly appreciated!
Please send this link to your friends that might be interested in supporting my dream gym!

Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

<h3>Operation: Get Better, Jen!</h3>
<p>Over the last year or so, I've gotten to befriend a wonderful person, Jen. As I've gotten to know her, I've come to find out she has a myriad of health problems, coupled with high medical bills. Some friends and I have decided to raise some money for her, even if it's just a bit, to help with things like physical therapy and medication. If we could, we'd love to raise the $30,000 it would cost to help her cover her spinal surgery. But for now, we'll hope to start with enough to make her daily life a little less painful.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here<strong>'s a story from Jen about her situation</strong>
</h3>
<p>I suppose I could set up the story as a ""once upon a time"" ordeals but there doesn't seem to be a time where the things just became bad.<br/><br/>My sister and I were really lucky to live with adopted parents who loved us as much as ours did. We never thought of ourselves as adopted or not their blood children. We were always their children despite any problems that might of happened. Neither of us asked them about our birth parents because we were happy and content with the people that loved us so much.<br/><br/>We had many a problems, my sister and I. We wouldn't get along or, she would blame things on me like broken artifacts or spilled milk. Her being 7 years older than me helped her since she had a broader view of the circumstance and I was still rather confused on why they were angry. <br/><br/>She ran away, did drugs, stole money from us, continuously came back only to run away again and drained my parents of their money and living because they loved her. They wanted her to get better. We all did.<br/><br/>Then one day, the phone call came that said she was found dead. From there, her cremation and ceremony took about seven thousand dollars to do. I think that's when all the trouble began.<br/><br/>After Kristy's death, I went on with life ad the remains of trying to get over a broken heart from my boyfriend and I breaking up due to communication problems and the fact that I was too emotional over her loss. He couldn't and didn't understand why I was so sad but that could of been my fault as well.<br/><br/>I was able to go to a College called Palomar in San Marcos California. I really liked the school. It was nice, the teachers were nice and I got to meet five friends who would then be apart of something we never dreamed of.<br/><br/>On a lovely April day, the five of us decide to get in a car and go to one of the near by parks in hopes of studying and getting some of our Japanese homework finished for a final coming up. We never made it to the park.<br/><br/>I'm still fuzzy on the details since I was instantly knocked out but, the driver was trying to show off changing lanes far too quickly and ended up losing control of the car and flipped us over about six times until we finally came to rest at the train tracks outside our school. [<a href=""http://images.plurk.com/d4e2a5007e451a60d0468a25ab9f283e.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Image of the wreckage.</a>]<br/><br/>While we were all rushed to the hospital, it felt like I had nothing too wrong with me. After the accident I went on with life as normal. Got a job, kept going to school, moved in with my new boyfriend[a survivor of our car crash] and things seemed great. I kept having small pains in my back but since I was never X-Rayed or MRI-ed after the car crash like I should of been, I never knew there was a developing problem.<br/><br/>A couple of years go by and the back pains are getting worse. I had to quit that job from pain and moved back home to help parents with payments on the house or else they'd lose it.  I tried to get another job locally where I am but as I was there one day, leaning over the counter to read up on something, I felt the first severe pain.<br/><br/>I couldn't lift myself up. I was leaned over and my spine would not allow me to lean up at all. It felt locked in place and while my boss asked me to come over for a moment I just winced, smiled and nodded and tried my best to go over there despite the pain. I couldn't push myself up completely but I tried.  <br/><br/>I worked there for about a week. Every night I would come home in tears because of my spine. I tried to just shake it off and go back the next day only to have a repeat of the previous where my back would lock up and I'd be immobile for a good five minutes. Because of that I had to quit there. My parents and my boyfriend didn't want me to have to continuously come home in tears. <br/><br/>The back aches got worse and gradually worse. I didn't have money to get insurance so I had spent most of my time going to a free clinic where I was simply given tramadol and flexeril, muscle relaxers. However, Tramadol is a narcotic drug. I've been on it for about 3 years. Because of that, if I go 15 hours without a tramadol I have severe withdraw attacks. <br/><br/>The medicine helps but knowing I have to be on a clock schedule for the medicine felt kind of like a downer for me. One night I was out of them and while sleep wasn't easy, I did get some rest. However, my boyfriend noticed my body was acting strange. I would have to twist and turn and lash my arms out and about because they were so tense from the narcotic. I would smash my shoulder in to the closet door and twist my arm around as if I were attempting to break it. All of that would go away once I had my medicine though. And the medicine DID help a lot. It still does. I'm still on it as of now.<br/><br/>Happiness came in the form of a hobby known as Cosplay. I had made some horns for my Ragnarok Online costumes but apparently they were a hit and a friend off-handedly suggested I tried making the Homestuck Troll Horns. Not wanting to step on toes, I asked the creator, Andrew Hussie for permission first. Within about 30 minutes of asking, he wrote back and told me that it was great! He'd be happy for me to which I thought was extra nice of him. That May, I was able to sell them at Fanime-Con and we made a nice deal of money.<br/><br/>Since then, Andrew allowed me to sell under his Copyright. I was able to do the Cosplay troll horns for those who commissioned me. The money I had set aside that would only be used once their commissions were mailed out, were used for my day to day life. Eating, medication, doctor visits[ Free clinics charged a fee of 35$ per visit] and to help my parents with their life. However, because of the kind of stress that came with it, I'd have to shrug off all the negative comments and anger people would send my way saying that I was cheating Andrew or doing illegal activity. <br/><br/>Thankfully, a day came where my hopes were answered. After being turned away from every insurance group a group in California known as PCIP finally took me in. They take in those with per-excisting medical conditions. However, the price for every month is 140$. That's still a little much for someone who has no job.<br/><br/>However, I was able to finally get seen by a doctor who then referred me to a physical therapist. I was able to do hydro therapy which felt wonderful but every. EVERY. session is 80$. Again, as someone with no job, 80$ was a lot per-visit. <br/><br/>The day came where I was finally able to get my MRI to see what was going on in my spine. What they found has put me in a set back.<br/><br/>At the base of my spine I have two disks that are crushed together, pinching the nerves of my spinal cord that makes sitting, standing, laying, anything uncomfortable. I have to constantly be careful of how I move and how I arrange myself. I can't walk for long or the pinching worsens. Near the top of my spine, I have bone spurs beginning to shoot out. For those who don't know, bone spurs are build ups of Calcium that begin to come out and look like spikes on my spine. <br/><br/>After that, the doctor perscriped pain therapy for aid before they have to take the drastic measures of spinal therapy. [It will be done they just want to do as little as possible.] Spinal repair could cost anything from eight thousand dollars to thirty thousand dollars with therapy afterwords. Needless to say I have a way to go before I can get that fixt.<br/><br/>My boyfriend got a job for us. He's been working really hard for the money he's earned and most of it goes to my parents so they're able to continue living in their house. Both are retired nearing their mid 70's and because they're in such bad shape they've contemplated going back in to the work field. My mom has gone to get an interview to be a pizza delivery person and that crushes me.  I don't want her out at night making deliveries to places she doesn't know. She's 4'9 and far more fragile than me. Dad does consulting work with a friend of his but that's about a thousand dollars every two months which goes away quickly with bills. <br/><br/>One day, getting on the on ramp to the freeway, out of nowhere it seemed, a semi-truck clipped the bumper of  my car and caught it. The car was then dragged along the left side of the semi-truck until it was turned to face towards oncoming traffic. The entire left part of the car had been utterly destroyed and the Semi-truck dragged it for about 4 blocks. [<a href=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7op0nj7fQ1qcpbpwo1_500.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Image 1 </a> <a href=""http://images.plurk.com/1860cafaf1c450e88c174924561f9a16.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Image 2 </a> ---images of my car.]<br/><br/>Since then, my car has been taken to the junk yard and stripped for parts. The Semi-truck is trying to say it was our fault and a settlement may not be reached until four to five months. This has left me without a car and without a car I've had to halt my pain therapy, physical therapy and I've since stopped doing the commissions for Homestuck Horns after a series of people told me to put a gun in my mouth or that when I get in a car crash next time, to actually do the world a favor and die. <br/><br/>Dad has since found out he's in the 75% chance of having a heart attack due to his genes. My grandmother had one in 1973 and I never got to meet her. She had clogged arteries that had resulted in such and now he's facing the same fate. He's doing what he can and we try and work on Wii Fit together even if I have to be extra careful sometimes.<br/><br/>We're still behind on payments for the house. I've begun selling off some of my possessions and so has my mother. She had taken my grandmother's wedding rings, designed by my grandfather to give to her, and has sold them to get money. She's also begun selling other things like necklaces and earrings my grandfather had given her. It kills me to see them selling their memories but in desperate times you do things, I suppose.<br/><br/>I'm trying to keep my head up. I'm trying to think better days will come but right now, it seems cheaper for a funeral than to keep going. I'll still do what I can, if not for myself then for the parents that took me in and raised me as their own.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What this means to us</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $1000, which should be good for a few physical therapy sessions, as well as help pay for her insurance. Anything more raised than that, and hopefully she'll be able to get more of the therapy, medication, tests, and procedures done she needs, and she can live a normal life.</p>

</div></div>","Operation: Get Better, Jen!
Over the last year or so, I've gotten to befriend a wonderful person, Jen. As I've gotten to know her, I've come to find out she has a myriad of health problems, coupled with high medical bills. Some friends and I have decided to raise some money for her, even if it's just a bit, to help with things like physical therapy and medication. If we could, we'd love to raise the $30,000 it would cost to help her cover her spinal surgery. But for now, we'll hope to start with enough to make her daily life a little less painful.
 
Here's a story from Jen about her situation

I suppose I could set up the story as a ""once upon a time"" ordeals but there doesn't seem to be a time where the things just became bad.My sister and I were really lucky to live with adopted parents who loved us as much as ours did. We never thought of ourselves as adopted or not their blood children. We were always their children despite any problems that might of happened. Neither of us asked them about our birth parents because we were happy and content with the people that loved us so much.We had many a problems, my sister and I. We wouldn't get along or, she would blame things on me like broken artifacts or spilled milk. Her being 7 years older than me helped her since she had a broader view of the circumstance and I was still rather confused on why they were angry. She ran away, did drugs, stole money from us, continuously came back only to run away again and drained my parents of their money and living because they loved her. They wanted her to get better. We all did.Then one day, the phone call came that said she was found dead. From there, her cremation and ceremony took about seven thousand dollars to do. I think that's when all the trouble began.After Kristy's death, I went on with life ad the remains of trying to get over a broken heart from my boyfriend and I breaking up due to communication problems and the fact that I was too emotional over her loss. He couldn't and didn't understand why I was so sad but that could of been my fault as well.I was able to go to a College called Palomar in San Marcos California. I really liked the school. It was nice, the teachers were nice and I got to meet five friends who would then be apart of something we never dreamed of.On a lovely April day, the five of us decide to get in a car and go to one of the near by parks in hopes of studying and getting some of our Japanese homework finished for a final coming up. We never made it to the park.I'm still fuzzy on the details since I was instantly knocked out but, the driver was trying to show off changing lanes far too quickly and ended up losing control of the car and flipped us over about six times until we finally came to rest at the train tracks outside our school.

<p>Bitmec is a digital health system that delivers quality, affordable medical care to underserved rural areas. The Bitmec system consists of three pillars that are connected through an interactive web portal: (i) patients located in rural communities; (ii) a network of itinerant community health workers; (iii) a network of remote doctors connected to the Bitmec portal.<br/><br/>Bitmec's network of health workers links patients living in communities without access to healthcare and a network of remote doctors. Bitmec's network of health workers links patients living in communities without access to healthcare and a network of remote doctors. During the first interaction between the Bitmec health worker and the patient, the health worker registers the patient in the Bitmec database, including demographic information, medical history and other relevant information. Once the registration is complete, the health worker enters the symptoms reported by the patient and takes vital signs. Once the health worker completes the information collection and symptom reporting steps, the health worker presses the send button and the platform sends the case to a remote doctor.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Doctor Network:</strong></p>
<p>A network of remote doctors assists patients through an embedded video system.  The network consists mainly of young doctors starting their careers who don’t have recurring patients and their own practice.</p>
<p>Each doctor connects to the Bitmec portal and prior to the start of the video consultation, the doctor has the opportunity to review the case. During the video consultation, the platform provides the doctor with applications to generate medical notes, medical prescriptions and laboratory orders.</p>
<p>WHO’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (""<strong>ICD</strong>""). The diagnoses feed a database and allow statistical analysis. The doctor's portal contains a calendar function and a patient database. The doctor can schedule an appointment and generate a referral to other doctors within Bitmec or a conventional health center.  Communication with the patient is carried out through SMS messages.</p>
<p>    </p>
<h3>Bitmec's Story</h3>
<p>It began with one of the founders (David) personal experience. After undergoing major back surgery and learning to walk again, a sense of purpose was born within him; trying to help others who have not been blessed with the opportunity he had of having access to the best medical care he could have ever hoped for.</p>
<p><br/>After deciding to move forward with this purpose, an incredible group of cofounders was born, all with the idea of wanting to bring change for those most in need. Through extensive research and understanding of the barriers that exist for rural communities in developing economies to access to quality medical care, the team created a solution that brings healthcare directly to the community.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Have Achieved</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570722975/tvqi9gsprnrgyvoiv60i.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently we are in the first phase of implementing our digital health system in marginalized areas of the population through 2 different focus points which are corporate and retail. So far we have focused our operational efforts in 6 different areas in Guatemala which are Quetzaltenango, San Marcos, Retalhuleu, Suchitepéquez, Jutiapa and Zacapa together with our strategic partner in the area who is a retailer chain in this part of the country. Our next step is to expand our focus directly in to communities, which is where we will invest the money raised through this campaign. We will focus on providing our health services to communities far away from urban centers which do not have access to medical care and thus have a huge need for an integral solution like Bitmec.</p>
<p>In a second phase, we are contemplating the idea of incorporating educative modules that will allow for the development of more human resources to offer our services.</p>
<p><strong>It is important to note that Bitmec not only focuses on the healthcare service it provides, it also impacts society by creating new jobs for local health practitioners who have the cultural and linguistical characteristics of the communities where we offer our services. Improving quality of life through more services, developing workforce and increasing monthly incomes for our team members in these communities helps prevent more people from migrating to look for a better life.</strong></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Help Us Give Medical Care To All!</span></h3>
<p>We are raising money in order to scale the amount of people Bitmec is able to impact. With your support, we would complete another 2,400 consultations as we will be able to hire more doctors and health promotores in order to scale the impact significantly. This benchmark will also help us understand even better our market.</p>

The Bitmec system consists of three pillars that are connected through an interactive web portal: (i) patients located in rural communities; (ii) a network of itinerant community health workers; (iii) a network of remote doctors connected to the Bitmec portal.Bitmec's network of health workers links patients living in communities without access to healthcare and a network of remote doctors. Bitmec's network of health workers links patients living in communities without access to healthcare and a network of remote doctors. During the first interaction between the Bitmec health worker and the patient, the health worker registers the patient in the Bitmec database, including demographic information, medical history and other relevant information. Once the registration is complete, the health worker enters the symptoms reported by the patient and takes vital signs. Once the health worker completes the information collection and symptom reporting steps, the health worker presses the send button and the platform sends the case to a remote doctor. 
Doctor Network:
A network of remote doctors assists patients through an embedded video system.  The network consists mainly of young doctors starting their careers who don’t have recurring patients and their own practice.
Each doctor connects to the Bitmec portal and prior to the start of the video consultation, the doctor has the opportunity to review the case. During the video consultation, the platform provides the doctor with applications to generate medical notes, medical prescriptions and laboratory orders.
WHO’s International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (""ICD""). The diagnoses feed a database and allow statistical analysis. The doctor's portal contains a calendar function and a patient database. The doctor can schedule an appointment and generate a referral to other doctors within Bitmec or a conventional health center.  Communication with the patient is carried out through SMS messages.
    
Bitmec's Story
It began with one of the founders (David) personal experience. After undergoing major back surgery and learning to walk again, a sense of purpose was born within him; trying to help others who have not been blessed with the opportunity he had of having access to the best medical care he could have ever hoped for.
After deciding to move forward with this purpose, an incredible group of cofounders was born, all with the idea of wanting to bring change for those most in need. Through extensive research and understanding of the barriers that exist for rural communities in developing economies to access to quality medical care, the team created a solution that brings healthcare directly to the community.
 

What We Have Achieved

 
The Impact
Currently we are in the first phase of implementing our digital health system in marginalized areas of the population through 2 different focus points which are corporate and retail. So far we have focused our operational efforts in 6 different areas in Guatemala which are Quetzaltenango, San Marcos, Retalhuleu, Suchitepéquez, Jutiapa and Zacapa together with our strategic partner in the area who is a retailer chain in this part of the country. Our next step is to expand our focus directly in to communities, which is where we will invest the money raised through this campaign. We will focus on providing our health services to communities far away from urban centers which do not have access to medical care and thus have a huge need for an integral solution like Bitmec.
In a second phase, we are contemplating the idea of incorporating educative modules that will allow for the development of more human resources to offer our services.
It is important to note that Bitmec not only focuses on the healthcare service it provides, it also impacts society by creating new jobs for local health practitioners who have the cultural and linguistical characteristics of the communities where we offer our services. Improving quality of life through more services, developing workforce and increasing monthly incomes for our team members in these communities helps prevent more people from migrating to look for a better life.
 

Help Us Give Medical Care To All!
We are raising money in order to scale the amount of people Bitmec is able to impact. With your support, we would complete another 2,400 consultations as we will be able to hire more doctors and health promotores in order to scale the impact significantly. This benchmark will also help us understand even better our market.

Funding Goal: $30,000 to achieve 2400 medical consultations.

If we don't reach our entire goal, funding received will be used for the consultations equal to the money achieved.

<p><span>We all have moods and personalities—but what about when we sleep? Is there such a thing as a sleep personality? Does your “sleep mood” at night affect your mood in the morning? How is who we are when we’re asleep connected to who we are during the day? Just like there is a personality type matrix called </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a><span>, can we invent a ""sleep personality"" type?</span></p>
<p>Welcome to project <strong>ZeeMee</strong>, brought to you by the team at <a href=""http://www.zansors.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zansors</a>. We hope you’ll join us in developing something totally cool and different—a “wearable” sensor that detects and gathers information about how people sleep. Smart and sophisticated from a technology point of view, yet simple to use and understand, <strong>ZeeMee</strong> taps into our fascination with the mystery of sleep and dreams—and the very real impact sleep has on our daily lives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep is something we all do – animals too! We spend much of our lives sleeping, yet in many ways it’s a mystery.</li>
<li>The way you sleep is meaningful. Even when you’re not dreaming, your sleep is full of patterns and signs.</li>
<li>Your sleep helps define who you are and how you behave every day. It’s part of your personality. It’s profoundly connected to your mood and your outlook.</li>
</ul><p>Do you remember mood rings? Well, Zansors wants to democratize our technology and create a fun, easy-to-use device that reports on your sleep in the morning—so you get a “sleep personality” score that you can talk about and compare with others. Are you a Green-2 (we call that Black Bear); Yellow-3 (Siamese House Cat) or are you a Red-4 or 5 (Sloth or Shark)?  See our matrix below for some of our other ""scores."" </p>
<p><strong>With your help, we can bring ZeeMee to life.</strong></p>
<p>We are a start-up based in Washington D.C called Zansors. A few of our Z-Crew superheros (<span>tech nerds who love to make/build)</span> key to this project are:  </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/558954/pictures/full/20121128232359-ProfilePic_Zansors_Teamv3.png?1354173843"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>The Z-Crew came together a year ago because we love technology and the mystery of sleep. We came up with the concept of</span><strong> ZeeMee</strong><span> because we were all curious about our own sleep personalities and figured other people would would be interested as well.  With that </span><strong>ZeeMee</strong><span> was born!</span></p>
<h1><strong>WHAT DOES IT DO</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ZeeMee</strong> is a wireless sleep patch powered by micro-sensors. It’s comfortable and easy to sleep with.</li>
<li>When you wake up, <strong>ZeeMee</strong> will tell you how you slept. It displays a color (green, yellow, or red) and a number (1 to 5).</li>
<li>The color is based on the way you breathed during the night.</li>
<li>The number is based your motion—how much you tossed and turned.</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""ZeeMee's color and number give a unique &quot;sleep personality&quot; - see the score table below"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/558953/pictures/full/20121128232321-20121127_WhatDoesItDo.png?1354173806"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZeeMee's color and number give a unique &quot;sleep personality&quot; - see the score table below""/></p>

<p>Knowing your sleep personality can be helpful for you and others: <em>Stay away from the Red-5!

Crunchwear: Zansors Wearable Sleep Sensor allows you to measure your ’sleep personality’
TechZone360: Zansors Creates New Sleep Patch that Measures Your Sleep Personality
We all have moods and personalities—but what about when we sleep? Is there such a thing as a sleep personality? Does your “sleep mood” at night affect your mood in the morning? How is who we are when we’re asleep connected to who we are during the day? Just like there is a personality type matrix called Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, can we invent a ""sleep personality"" type?
Welcome to project ZeeMee, brought to you by the team at Zansors. We hope you’ll join us in developing something totally cool and different—a “wearable” sensor that detects and gathers information about how people sleep. Smart and sophisticated from a technology point of view, yet simple to use and understand, ZeeMee taps into our fascination with the mystery of sleep and dreams—and the very real impact sleep has on our daily lives:

Sleep is something we all do – animals too! We spend much of our lives sleeping, yet in many ways it’s a mystery.
The way you sleep is meaningful. Even when you’re not dreaming, your sleep is full of patterns and signs.
Your sleep helps define who you are and how you behave every day. It’s part of your personality. It’s profoundly connected to your mood and your outlook.
Do you remember mood rings? Well, Zansors wants to democratize our technology and create a fun, easy-to-use device that reports on your sleep in the morning—so you get a “sleep personality” score that you can talk about and compare with others. Are you a Green-2 (we call that Black Bear); Yellow-3 (Siamese House Cat) or are you a Red-4 or 5 (Sloth or Shark)?  See our matrix below for some of our other ""scores."" 
With your help, we can bring ZeeMee to life.
We are a start-up based in Washington D.C called Zansors. A few of our Z-Crew superheros (tech nerds who love to make/build) key to this project are:  

The Z-Crew came together a year ago because we love technology and the mystery of sleep. We came up with the concept of ZeeMee because we were all curious about our own sleep personalities and figured other people would would be interested as well.  With that ZeeMee was born!
WHAT DOES IT DO


ZeeMee is a wireless sleep patch powered by micro-sensors. It’s comfortable and easy to sleep with.
When you wake up, ZeeMee will tell you how you slept. It displays a color (green, yellow, or red) and a number (1 to 5).
The color is based on the way you breathed during the night.
The number is based your motion—how much you tossed and turned.

ZeeMee's color and number give a unique ""sleep personality"" - see the score table below
Knowing your sleep personality can be helpful for you and others: Stay away from the Red-5! How is the Yellow-3 going to act around me? You will discover how your mood and temperament during sleep affects your day - and vice versa.  We've developed our own ""sleep personality"" type for you to compare for fun.

What unique sleep personality do you wake up to?
OUR VISION
Zansors builds high-quality, low-cost micro/nano sensor platforms. These sensors are the same ones in your car (air bag sensor, tire pressure sensors), iPhone, or Microsoft Kinect.
Our knowledge and expertise is not just in sensors, but also in both software analytics and design. We have an expert team exploring new ways to make technology platforms more creative, easy to use, and relevant to our daily lives.
ZeeMee represents the best of our technology married to the best of our creative thinking—a great way to bring innovation to unexpected places.  
KEY FEATURES


Simple and easy-to-use: You just wake up and look at the color and number readout for your sleep personality.

Super hardware technology inside: We packed 99 parts in a small space, including micro-controller, sensors, and battery.

Super software algorithms built inside: We have studied breathing and motion to build unique algorithms to give you your sleep personality score.

Small: The ZeeMee patch is 1.5 inch x 2.0 inch.

Comfortable: Feels hardly there, like a band-aid on your neck.

Rugged, but kind to your skin: We use special adhesives from our supplier that are used for band-aids or dermal patches.

Affordable: Our smart team found the ""special-sauce"" to democratize this technology.
HOW YOU CAN HELP
We need your help to produce the first batch of ZeeMee sensor patches and democratize the technology. Not only do we need your financial backing, but we need curious and technology savvy users ready and willing to explore their sleep personality using sensor technology.  We've done our homework too - we made physical prototypes and tested with our special software.

 Indiegogo community can complete the ZeeMee project!

In the above photos, you can see a physical prototype that was fabricated at our foundry and tested (while person sleeping). The size is small and can be attached to a specialized adhesive.
YOUR HELP WILL GET US TO THE FINISH LINE and ready for production with our beautiful, final design!  Here's what we have completed since March 2012:  

Developed the sleep score algorithms corresponding to colors and numbers based on breathing and motion patterns during sleep
Bill of materials for hardware components created
Electrical schematics completed
Embedded/firmware software completed
Prototype developed at a semiconductor foundry and professional testing conducted
Supply chain and logistics established - not in our garage but in a professional space
Identified the right adhesives by an expert firm in the space
Consulted with experts in sleep


With your pledge of $75 or more, you will be one of the first to explore this new world of sleep personality using sensor technology.    

WHAT YOU GET

Starting with a pledge of $75 or more you get the fully assembled wireless sensor patch called ZeeMee (see final version picture below).  You take the ZeeMee out of the box, press the button and have fun discovering your sleep personality using sensors.  
ZeeMee's Hardware
Classic:  If you support the CLASSIC, then there is only one piece and it'sZeeMee.  No other external parts besides some extra sticky pads so you have fresh one to use each night.  The Zansors team has put together 99 parts that go on the miniaturized PC board.  The hardware includes micro-controllers for software processing, semiconductor circuits, micro-sensors for measuring breathing and motion, and memory to store your sleep personality data.
Special Edition:  If you support the SPECIAL EDITION, then you will not only get the ZeeMee but you will get a special cord that allows for recharging.
ZeeMee's Size  
A picture is worth a thousand words. Need we say more?

ZeeMee wireless sensor patch - size comparison
ZeeMee's Software
All of the software is built inside the hardware.  If you support the CLASSIC, just stick it on and go to sleep. You do not have to download anything.  The software to measure breathing sounds and motion were developed by our Chief Data Science Officer who has a Ph.D. in biostatistics; he made the proprietary algorithms.  We also have an embedded/firmware software engineer to make sure the software works 100% with hardware. 
If you support the SPECIAL EDITION, you get a free app (sleep log) that will sync with your ZeeMee so you can read your sleep personality data real-time (second-by-second) like stock charts or sports stats. Our Information Architect guru and software developers are designing a beautiful experience for you.  The Z-team will post updates on this site on the progress of this app before the April delivery.  This very same team made the app called Sleep Champ based on University of Michigan research so we know how to make apps and get approval from Apple and Google.   
Specs


Size: 1.5 inch x 2.0 inch (2.5 cm x 5.0 cm); 0.1 inch (2.5 mm) thick

Weight:  0.1 ounces (4.0 grams)

Battery:  3 volts; coin battery that you can replace

However, the most common approaches are the Gravity method and the Waterfall method. Here is some more insight into the Waterfall:</div><div><br/></div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/80036058?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><h4>Why steel?<br/>
</h4><p>We use the same, high quality food grade stainless steel used every day by food and pharmaceutical makers. Stainless steel was developed not to leach any chemicals or corrode in even the harshest environments. It’s what hypodermic needles and most surgical tools are made of. Best of all, it is suited for high temperatures well beyond what a lighter flame can reach. The other main reasons we chose steel are these:</p><ul>
<li><p>Steel will not shatter. Throw it in your backpack, drop it on the ground. Back over it with your car. Besides being food-safe and sanitary, you will not need to replace it.</p></li>
<li><p>The weight of the Steel creates an airtight seal when dropped into a standard sized bottle without needing to thread anything. Thread sizes can vary widely. The Smoking Steel skips that inconvenience with an exacted shape, diameter, and weight.</p></li>
</ul><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/81034671"" title=""Don't Try This With Glass"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><h4>How hot does the piece get while in use?</h4><p>In our experience and from feedback through our beta testers, you need to take about 6 or 7 Gravities back to back (and we mean rapid-fire back to back) in order to get the piece even warm enough to notice. If that is something you are repeatedly doing, we should hang out sometime.</p><h4>Isn’t smoking out of a plastic bottle unhealthy?</h4><p>PET is very stable at the temperatures the Smoking Steel is meant to operate at. The thermal mass of the bowl keeps heat from the direct flame and cherry from reaching temperatures high enough to cause PET to give off gas or melt. Any smoke that's cool enough to put in your lungs is not going to be anywhere close to the temperatures that would affect PET. There is no difference between inhaling air or smoke (at room temp) out of a bottle and inhaling water or some other beverage out of a PET bottle.</p><p>Some people have probably had experiences with PET where it smelled like chemicals- this is because they got the PET hot enough to melt or burn. Don't burn PET and there isn't a problem. The Greeb is specially engineered to keep the heat away from the PET as opposed to old school methods that make it easy to melt the bottle with your lighter.</p><p>That said, smoking anything isn't exactly healthy. If you have concerns about some trace amount of nanites or some other chemical goblins getting into your smoke you may want to think about another form of consumption.</p><h4>Where are AC Greebs Products Manufactured?</h4><p>The AC Greebs Smoking Steel is an American product manufactured in Richmond, Virginia. As compared to many “high tech” smoking devices that are marketed as healthier or higher quality but are often made from questionable parts or materials overseas, our factory floor is about five minutes away from our front door and for us, quality control is job one. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/81216037"" title=""Make the most of the outdoors"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><h1>Testimonials</h1><p>Real feedback from real people.

The portable, durable, efficient bowl is easily cleaned, drops neatly in your pocket, and can be used in nearly any smoking context.Now we’re ready to share this classic design so you can make the most of wherever you are with a quick smoke break. We’re raising funds to expand AC’s design into a modular smoking system, all based around his first piece, the AC Greebs Smoking Steel. Machined from 304 stainless, the Smoking Steel turns bottles into efficient smoking devices. It travels easily, without the fear of broken glass. Its jetted airways create incredibly milky hits, while using a minimal amount of your precious herbs. The tapered shape seals airtight in most standard 2-liter and smaller bottles, yet it's easily removed. And because it's stainless, cleaning is a breeze. Just toss the Smoking Steel in a small container (we like film canisters, if you can find one) with some alcohol and salt, shake vigorously, and you're set to go. What We Need
When we started this project, our goal was to make something more effective than a socket melted through a bottle cap and more portable and durable than glass. We think the Smoking Steel is exactly that. Now, with your help, we can bring our larger vision to life. Your contributions will help us do two things.First, you can help us fill an order at a scale that becomes cost-efficient. Turning these out by hand is great for friends and family, but we want to share with everyone. Second, you can help us prototype a line of accessories to expand on the functionality of the Smoking Steel. Our first planned accessory is a pipe base to allow for bottle and water-free use of the bowl.
What You GetWhen you contribute, you can choose from our list of perks, including receiving one of the first Smoking Steels produced. We also have perks to beef up your wardrobe with an AC Greebs shirt and to share the joy of the Smoking Steel with friends. Most importantly, we can get your Smoking Steel to you in time to go under your Christmas trees. Donations can be made anonymously and perks will be shipped in a discreet box or envelope.Everyone who contributes will also receive a coupon for 15% off a purchase from the AC Greebs online store when we launch in 2014. Early supporters can get our Early Bird perks, which are limited in number and will ship in time for the holidays. Bring smiles to your loved ones' faces by donating early. With the go-anywhere, indestructible, quick-cleaning AC Greebs Smoking Steel we can turn corner stores to head shops. And it will happen with your support!Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do I use it?The Smoking Steel bowl is made to be versatile and modular, and as such your imagination is really the only limitation. However, the most common approaches are the Gravity method and the Waterfall method. Here is some more insight into the Waterfall:Why steel?
We use the same, high quality food grade stainless steel used every day by food and pharmaceutical makers. Stainless steel was developed not to leach any chemicals or corrode in even the harshest environments. It’s what hypodermic needles and most surgical tools are made of. Best of all, it is suited for high temperatures well beyond what a lighter flame can reach. The other main reasons we chose steel are these:
Steel will not shatter. Throw it in your backpack, drop it on the ground. Back over it with your car. Besides being food-safe and sanitary, you will not need to replace it.
The weight of the Steel creates an airtight seal when dropped into a standard sized bottle without needing to thread anything. Thread sizes can vary widely. The Smoking Steel skips that inconvenience with an exacted shape, diameter, and weight.
How hot does the piece get while in use?In our experience and from feedback through our beta testers, you need to take about 6 or 7 Gravities back to back (and we mean rapid-fire back to back) in order to get the piece even warm enough to notice. If that is something you are repeatedly doing, we should hang out sometime.Isn’t smoking out of a plastic bottle unhealthy?PET is very stable at the temperatures the Smoking Steel is meant to operate at. The thermal mass of the bowl keeps heat from the direct flame and cherry from reaching temperatures high enough to cause PET to give off gas or melt. Any smoke that's cool enough to put in your lungs is not going to be anywhere close to the temperatures that would affect PET. There is no difference between inhaling air or smoke (at room temp) out of a bottle and inhaling water or some other beverage out of a PET bottle.Some people have probably had experiences with PET where it smelled like chemicals- this is because they got the PET hot enough to melt or burn. Don't burn PET and there isn't a problem. The Greeb is specially engineered to keep the heat away from the PET as opposed to old school methods that make it easy to melt the bottle with your lighter.That said, smoking anything isn't exactly healthy. If you have concerns about some trace amount of nanites or some other chemical goblins getting into your smoke you may want to think about another form of consumption.Where are AC Greebs Products Manufactured?The AC Greebs Smoking Steel is an American product manufactured in Richmond, Virginia. As compared to many “high tech” smoking devices that are marketed as healthier or higher quality but are often made from questionable parts or materials overseas, our factory floor is about five minutes away from our front door and for us, quality control is job one. TestimonialsReal feedback from real people. Some names have been changed for privacy.""In Oregon we call them 'liters' 'waterfalls' and 'aqua lungs' for the most part.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we are looking for is help in paying for the chin augmentation- as it is not covered as it is considered cosmetic surgery. Dr. Reichman the dental surgeon has suggested that if we can raise or come up with the money- he can do both surgeries at one time- which would make life alot easier for Steven. For many years- he has always talked to me about how he looks and what he wants to look like- and as his mother- i want to make that possible for him. But this is where help comes in from other people as I am on disability and my funds are limited- I need to raise $2800.00 to help him get his chin implant. By any help we get- Steven and I will be grateful for the rest of our lives.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Steven is a great young man- and he has been with me since the day he was born- and his looks have never bothered me- i love him just the way he is- but this isnt about what mom wants- its about what Steven wants. I feel that if he finally can get this chin implant- he will feel more secure with who is as a man.</p>

<p>Faithful Fiagbedzi is a 13 year old girl from Ghana, Africa. Born with a deformity in her right hand, Faithful has been limited in her mobility for all of her life. At birth she was taken to 3 hospitals because her wrist was turned backwards but nobody mentioned that surgery was an option. Her parents have tried bringing her to numerous doctors in Africa but no one will take her case. The  African Government will not help because Faithful is a just one little girl and why should they care about her, right?</p>

<h3>A Miracle Waiting to Happen</h3>

<h4><span><b>What are Parkour Utah and EVOLV3 Movement?</b></span></h4>
<p>Parkour Utah (PKUT) is the largest organizer and promoter of the discipline of parkour in the state of Utah. We believe that parkour is the best and most engaging form of exercise for all ages. Our purpose is to provide a place for community interaction as well as professional instruction to individuals through classes, workshops, and events as well as growth in parkour and other similar movements.</p>
<p>Parkour Utah is a sister company to EVOLV3 Movement. The purpose of EVOLV3 Movement is to be a larger national and worldwide name for parkour.  EVOLV3 has three main purposes: Movement, Community, and Competition. EVOLV3 Movement is the name for the gyms, but they will be organized and run by Parkour Utah.</p>
<h4><b>Purpose of Our Campaign</b></h4>
<p>We are raising funds for parkour facilities across the State of Utah. We are opening the gyms in November 2013. Ultimately, our goal is to provide these gyms as locations for people of all movement disciplines to collaborate and practice what they do.</p>
<p>The gyms will be built even if we do not meet our goal from donations. The money we receive through our donors will be used to fund our initial building of structures. When you contribute you are helping us get the gyms rolling in the right direction, as well as investing in our awesome community. The initial build out will be primitive, but it will be a start for our awesome community. </p>
<p>Parkour Utah has already made a lot of developments in getting the gyms ready. We have made leaps to organize the community and organize parkour events. We have done research into building design and layout, and made the necessary steps into having our own space for the gyms. All we need now is some additional help from members in our community.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><b>Why Build Gyms?</b></h4>
<p>Here in Utah it is common that when the weather turns cold, traceurs (parkour practitioners) go into a ""winter hibernation."" Many traceurs either do not have the ability or the desire to train during these winter months. In addition, there can be security and liability issues in doing parkour. Parkour is about using your environment for movement. Thus, in doing it, we might use equipment or obstacles in a different way than intended. This is the case in many local gymnastic gyms, and on private or public property we visit.</p>
<p>An indoor facility will allow individuals of every experience level to train all year round, as well as allow practitioners a safe place to meet up as a community, have competitions, and allow additional levels of progress and growth which outdoor environments generally do not allow. In these gyms, we will provide class instruction (beginner to advanced), large workshops, open gym time, competitions, and opportunities for large group parties.</p>

<h4><b>Where Will The Gyms Be?</b></h4>
<p>We decided to start by building 2 smaller gym facilities in Utah to minimize the distance between local traceurs and the closest gym. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will be constructing one gym in Salt Lake County, and the other in Utah County. </span></p>

<h3>Quick Facts</h3>

<p>95%: The percent of diseases, treatments and medications covered by the Ghanaian National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)</p>
<p>300: The number of kids in Hodzo Ga, a rural Ghanaian village, without health insurance</p>
<p>$600: The cost of providing health insurance for all the children in Hodzo Ga for one year</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>My Synopsis</h3>
<p>For those of you who just stumbled upon this page, my name is Arienne and I have been volunteering in Ho, Ghana for the past 5 weeks. My experience here has been truly incredible; I have learned so much about cultural awareness, medicine, and healthcare in a developing nation. As a fourth year pre-med student studying public health and global poverty and practice at UC Berkeley, I have found my time here to be invaluable in validating my desire to do medical work abroad. </p>
<p>To read more about my experience in Ghana, check out: gildagoesglobal.wordpress.com</p>
<h3>Why Health Insurance</h3>
<p>The first patient I interacted with at the Municipal Hospital in Ho, Ghana opened my eyes to the problem of health insurance that is prevalent throughout the country. </p>
<p>When I met her, Erica, an 8 month old who had arrived at the hospital unconscious and seizing from severe malaria, was a healthy, laughing infant who had been discharged for over a week. However, because Erica did not have health insurance, and her mother did not have the money to pay the 250 cedi (about $170 US) hospital bill, Erica remained in the hospital for 3 weeks after she was discharged. During that time, she once again contracted malaria, a tragically common occurrence due to the large volume of both malaria patients and mosquitoes in the children’s ward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Erica’s story is a familiar one. Many children in Ghana, particularly in the rural villages, do not have health insurance. Terrified by daunting medical bills, parents are less willing to seek professional medical care for their children when they fall ill. They then rush them to the nearest hospital when they fall dangerously ill, as Erica did. Delaying professional care not only exponentially raises the cost of treatment, it also increases mortality.</p>
<p>Lack of health insurance should not be such a devastating problem in Ghana. Unlike the US, the Ghanaian government is the sole health insurance provider. Through the NHIS, it only costs 4 cedi, the equivalent of $2 US, to insure a child for one year. </p>
<p>During the time I have spent at the municipal hospital, at community clinics and at rural outreaches, I have continually felt helpless to make a concrete change. I cannot do emergency surgery to save a woman bleeding to death from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy; I cannot convince the hospital staff to isolate a woman suffering from TB so that she does not infect the HIV patients with whom she shares a room.</p>
<p>With your support, providing health insurance to children in need is something that I am able to do. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Providing health insurance to all the children in the rural village of Hodzo Ga will have a tremendous impact not only on the children themselves, but also on their families and community. Treating malaria, the most common illness during the rainy season, costs betewen 2-4 cedis ($1-2), depending on treatment location. On average, chlldren get malaria 5-6 times a year, making malaria treatment alone between 10-24 cedi ($5-12) a year.</p>
<p>Raising $600 will cover health insurance costs for one year for the uninsured children in Hodzo Ga. Although my initial goal is to raise $600, any additional money will be used to provide health insurance to children in other communities. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

$600: The cost of providing health insurance for all the children in Hodzo Ga for one year


My Synopsis
For those of you who just stumbled upon this page, my name is Arienne and I have been volunteering in Ho, Ghana for the past 5 weeks. My experience here has been truly incredible; I have learned so much about cultural awareness, medicine, and healthcare in a developing nation. As a fourth year pre-med student studying public health and global poverty and practice at UC Berkeley, I have found my time here to be invaluable in validating my desire to do medical work abroad. 
To read more about my experience in Ghana, check out: gildagoesglobal.wordpress.com
Why Health Insurance
The first patient I interacted with at the Municipal Hospital in Ho, Ghana opened my eyes to the problem of health insurance that is prevalent throughout the country. 
When I met her, Erica, an 8 month old who had arrived at the hospital unconscious and seizing from severe malaria, was a healthy, laughing infant who had been discharged for over a week. However, because Erica did not have health insurance, and her mother did not have the money to pay the 250 cedi (about $170 US) hospital bill, Erica remained in the hospital for 3 weeks after she was discharged. During that time, she once again contracted malaria, a tragically common occurrence due to the large volume of both malaria patients and mosquitoes in the children’s ward.
Unfortunately, Erica’s story is a familiar one. Many children in Ghana, particularly in the rural villages, do not have health insurance. Terrified by daunting medical bills, parents are less willing to seek professional medical care for their children when they fall ill. They then rush them to the nearest hospital when they fall dangerously ill, as Erica did. Delaying professional care not only exponentially raises the cost of treatment, it also increases mortality.
Lack of health insurance should not be such a devastating problem in Ghana. Unlike the US, the Ghanaian government is the sole health insurance provider. Through the NHIS, it only costs 4 cedi, the equivalent of $2 US, to insure a child for one year. 
During the time I have spent at the municipal hospital, at community clinics and at rural outreaches, I have continually felt helpless to make a concrete change. I cannot do emergency surgery to save a woman bleeding to death from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy; I cannot convince the hospital staff to isolate a woman suffering from TB so that she does not infect the HIV patients with whom she shares a room.
With your support, providing health insurance to children in need is something that I am able to do. 


The Impact
Providing health insurance to all the children in the rural village of Hodzo Ga will have a tremendous impact not only on the children themselves, but also on their families and community. Treating malaria, the most common illness during the rainy season, costs betewen 2-4 cedis ($1-2), depending on treatment location. On average, chlldren get malaria 5-6 times a year, making malaria treatment alone between 10-24 cedi ($5-12) a year.
Raising $600 will cover health insurance costs for one year for the uninsured children in Hodzo Ga. Although my initial goal is to raise $600, any additional money will be used to provide health insurance to children in other communities.

But such a celebrated moment dissolves into a distant, sorrowful memory in developing countries including Kenya, <strong>as many mothers lose their lives during delivery.</strong> According to the WHO’s 2008 Global Health Observatory report, maternal mortality ratio in developing countries is 200~1,000 per 100,000 live births. This is a spark difference to many developed countries (including the U.S and European countries) where the number incredibly shrinks to 20 per 100,000 live births. Developing countries’ high figure comes of low accessibility for mothers to hospitals, unsanitary environment, and low recognition of tacking a good care of mothers’ health.<strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>      / </strong><strong>Traditional Masai House</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Masai homes are very narrow with low ceiling. They are dark and smoky, as  people  open fire for cooking and heating. Windows are not installed, so that <span lang=""EN-US"" style="""">the natural</span> light is not penetrated well. Houses are held up with mud and cow dungs, which increases the risk of getting infected.</p>

<p>Inside dispensary (<span lang=""EN-US"" style="""">a clinic located in remote areas)</span>, there is only one bed for mother’s delivery-which is very unsanitary. Some dispensaries lack every basic device except for a scale and a hand blood pressure meter.</p>
 In Kajiado, where most Masai tribesmen reside in, <strong>mothers traditionally deliver a baby at home</strong> with no help from <span lang=""EN-US"" style="""">medical professionals.</span><strong>This culture heightens the risk of mothers and babies easily getting infected</strong>. Dispensaries are in no better condition. As there are insufficient quantities of medical equipment, mothers are not able to use them in time at emergency. 
<p> Since 2005, Kajiado has made substantial development with the help of a Korean NGO called ‘Good Hands’. However, there has not been any specialized projects regarding the healthcare of mothers, and their mortality during pregnancy and childbirth is being emphasized as a major issue. FREEMED is preceding MHI project in collaboration with Good Hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2. ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
<p align=""left""><strong>FREEMED deliver Childbirth Kit and Clinic service directly to mothers in Kenya</strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Small donation, huge difference.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>FREEMED’s Maternal Healthcare Initiative project is thoroughly planned with maternal mortality statistics and analysis. The project aims to <strong>1) enable mothers in high risks to recognize their physical condition in FREEMED Clinic</strong>, and <strong>2) avert infections from unhygienic environments and postpartum bleeding</strong> by manufacturing and distributing <strong>FREEMED Childbirth Kit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)  </strong>  <strong>FREEMED Clinic</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/225034/pictures/full/20120430180457-FREEMED_in_Kenya_3_FREEMED_clinic_1.JPG?1335834347"" src="""" style=""""/>   <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/225033/pictures/full/20120430180454-FREEMED_in_Kenya_3_FREEMED_clinic_2.JPG?1335834347"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Freemed Clinic is going to devices for mothers to have a regular self check-up during their 40 weeks of pregnancy. There will be 1) blood pressure monitor(for vital sign check), thermography scale, 2) blood glucose monitor, 3) urine stick (for proteinuria check), 4) tapeline (for height of fundus), 5) Doppler (for fetal heart rate). Mothers and nurses in Kajiado dispensaries will be able to use them after orientation via <span lang=""EN-US"" style="""">photo manuals.</span></p>
<p>With the help from professionals, FREEMED have designed a chart to classify the high-risk mothers. Seven check-up <span lang=""EN-US"" style="""">equipments</span> will help mothers to figure out whether they are in a high risk, and this chart makes sure of such a state. (If the mark lies on green, the mother’s status is normal, but if the mark lies on red, she is in an abnormal state.)</p>
<p><strong>The clinic will be installed in 30 sites of Kajiado dispensary</strong>, and enable mothers to have <strong>a regular self-check up for their health condition</strong>. The installed clinic will be taken care by localized NGOs to be run in a sound condition.</p>

<p>FREEMED Childbirth Kit is well designed with only necessary equipment for mothers to have a safe childbirth. The Kit includes aseptic cloth for midwives and various items to prevent massive bleeding during the childbirth. Each item can be used easily by mothers for its intuitive design. Illiterate mothers or midwives would have no difficulty to use the Kit, as every step is fully described in pictures.</p>
<p><strong>1000 Kits will be distributed to 30 different dispensaries in Kajiado, Kenya.</strong> FREEMED expects to save 2 out of 3 mothers in emergent conditions.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Introducing FREEMED &amp; The Sketch of MHI in Jan. 2012</strong></p>
<p>FREEMED is a leading independent organization dedicated to working with undergraduate and graduate students with their full creativity to make lasting change in the lives of medically challenged people. Under the organization’s vision “to fill a medical gap in secluded areas and create medical culture of novel ideas”, FREEMED members whom major in various fields in Korea are participating in three departments-Medical, Design, and Management-to eagerly plan and foster valuable projects.</p>
<p>Eight core members equipped with thorough medical knowledge have planned Maternal Healthcare Initiative project for last 12 months. As a first step, <strong>they visited Kajiado, Kenya to seek for its application from 26<sup>th</sup> of Jan. to 5<sup>th</sup> of Feb., 2012</strong>. After a detailed research of medical system and maternal health status in Kenya, MHI team members discussed valuable ideas with local health experts upon MHI project and its way forward. <strong>FREEMED and Kenya Kajiado Health Center have signed the MOU</strong>. Maternal Health Initiative project is with Good Hands(NGO), KOICA and Embassy of Republic of Korea in the Republic of Kenya.</p>

1. PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT Other Ways You Can Help
seven-year-old girl Maroho imagines how her mother would have looked like.
For Maroho, a little girl with no memories of her mother at all, this is all she 
can do. 
  
Is there anything more important than the birth of new life? But such a celebrated moment dissolves into a distant, sorrowful memory in developing countries including Kenya, as many mothers lose their lives during delivery. According to the WHO’s 2008 Global Health Observatory report, maternal mortality ratio in developing countries is 200~1,000 per 100,000 live births. This is a spark difference to many developed countries (including the U.S and European countries) where the number incredibly shrinks to 20 per 100,000 live births. Developing countries’ high figure comes of low accessibility for mothers to hospitals, unsanitary environment, and low recognition of tacking a good care of mothers’ health.
 

â–¶ Maternal index analyzes health, education and economic conditions for women and children in 164 countries
 
  
< Site selection > 


According to the Save the Children’s report “State of the World’s Mothers 2011”, the mother index of Kenya has ranked 140thout of 162 countries, and major indexes on maternal conditions has been constantly deteriorating in the recent five years. Also, relief activities in Kenya have been focusing on slum areas inside Nairobi. Therefore, FREEMED plans to carry out the MHI project in Kajiado district, which is about 180 kilometers off from Nairobi.
* Maternal condition analyzes health, education and economic conditions for women and children in 164 countries.
      
      / Traditional Masai House
Masai homes are very narrow with low ceiling. They are dark and smoky, as  people  open fire for cooking and heating. Windows are not installed, so that the natural light is not penetrated well. Houses are held up with mud and cow dungs, which increases the risk of getting infected.
     / Hygiene of in Kajiado Dispensarie 
Inside dispensary (a clinic located in remote areas), there is only one bed for mother’s delivery-which is very unsanitary. Some dispensaries lack every basic device except for a scale and a hand blood pressure meter.
 In Kajiado, where most Masai tribesmen reside in, mothers traditionally deliver a baby at home with no help from medical professionals.This culture heightens the risk of mothers and babies easily getting infected. Dispensaries are in no better condition. As there are insufficient quantities of medical equipment, mothers are not able to use them in time at emergency. 
 Since 2005, Kajiado has made substantial development with the help of a Korean NGO called ‘Good Hands’. However, there has not been any specialized projects regarding the healthcare of mothers, and their mortality during pregnancy and childbirth is being emphasized as a major issue. FREEMED is preceding MHI project in collaboration with Good Hands.
 
2. ABOUT THE PROJECT
FREEMED deliver Childbirth Kit and Clinic service directly to mothers in Kenya
Small donation, huge difference.
 
FREEMED’s Maternal Healthcare Initiative project is thoroughly planned with maternal mortality statistics and analysis. The project aims to 1) enable mothers in high risks to recognize their physical condition in FREEMED Clinic, and 2) avert infections from unhygienic environments and postpartum bleeding by manufacturing and distributing FREEMED Childbirth Kit.
1)    FREEMED Clinic
   
Freemed Clinic is going to devices for mothers to have a regular self check-up during their 40 weeks of pregnancy. There will be 1) blood pressure monitor(for vital sign check), thermography scale, 2) blood glucose monitor, 3) urine stick (for proteinuria check), 4) tapeline (for height of fundus), 5) Doppler (for fetal heart rate). Mothers and nurses in Kajiado dispensaries will be able to use them after orientation via photo manuals.
With the help from professionals, FREEMED have designed a chart to classify the high-risk mothers. Seven check-up equipments will help mothers to figure out whether they are in a high risk, and this chart makes sure of such a state. (If the mark lies on green, the mother’s status is normal, but if the mark lies on red, she is in an abnormal state.)
The clinic will be installed in 30 sites of Kajiado dispensary, and enable mothers to have a regular self-check up for their health condition. The installed clinic will be taken care by localized NGOs to be run in a sound condition.
 
2) FREEMED Childbirth Kit 
  
FREEMED Childbirth Kit is well designed with only necessary equipment for mothers to have a safe childbirth. The Kit includes aseptic cloth for midwives and various items to prevent massive bleeding during the childbirth. Each item can be used easily by mothers for its intuitive design. Illiterate mothers or midwives would have no difficulty to use the Kit, as every step is fully described in pictures.
1000 Kits will be distributed to 30 different dispensaries in Kajiado, Kenya. FREEMED expects to save 2 out of 3 mothers in emergent conditions.
 
3. Introducing FREEMED & The Sketch of MHI in Jan. 2012
FREEMED is a leading independent organization dedicated to working with undergraduate and graduate students with their full creativity to make lasting change in the lives of medically challenged people. Under the organization’s vision “to fill a medical gap in secluded areas and create medical culture of novel ideas”, FREEMED members whom major in various fields in Korea are participating in three departments-Medical, Design, and Management-to eagerly plan and foster valuable projects.
Eight core members equipped with thorough medical knowledge have planned Maternal Healthcare Initiative project for last 12 months. As a first step, they visited Kajiado, Kenya to seek for its application from 26th of Jan. to 5th of Feb., 2012. After a detailed research of medical system and maternal health status in Kenya, MHI team members discussed valuable ideas with local health experts upon MHI project and its way forward. FREEMED and Kenya Kajiado Health Center have signed the MOU. Maternal Health Initiative project is with Good Hands(NGO), KOICA and Embassy of Republic of Korea in the Republic of Kenya.

</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3>Our Story</h3>
Hi. I'm <a href=""http://cassiecohn.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cassie</a>, producer and director of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Flossophy 101</span> music video. In 2005, I brought my <a href=""http://catf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">regional theater background </a>and <a href=""http://www.conservationfilm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">non-profit film festival founding experience</a> across the country from West Virginia to Portland, Oregon to work with a <a href=""http://thirdrailrep.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""">start up theater group</a>, but I had ulterior motives. As an experimental video producer for many years, I sought out further education in film making. Over the last six years spent in Portland, Oregon, I was an equipment room intern at the <a href=""http://nwfilm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""">Northwest Film Center</a> for four years before eventually being on staff. I worked every possible motion picture production gig that I could handle to learn as much as I could while meeting collaborators along the way. Last year, a few of us who found ourselves working together often and well decided to create a formal collective, <a href=""http://jabberwockyproductions.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""">Jabberwocky Productions</a>. Since then, I've been seeking out work, as a producer/director, that has a positive impact on the community, features local talent on and off camera, and allows room for creativity at every step of the process.

<br/><br/>When I first met Dave (aka <a href=""http://www.vanoodles.com/home.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Van Oodles</a>) in September 2010, I responded to his music and loved his ideas, particularly the concept of the new album. His song creation process from conception to execution was similar to how I want to mold my film making process. I was so comfortable sharing creative ideas with him, that I walked away from our first meeting having offered to produce a music video for Van oodles' upcoming single ""Flossophy 101."" After our next meeting, we developed a script about a man (played by <a href=""http://www.vanoodles.com/home.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Van Oodles</a>) who comes home and falls asleep without brushing or flossing his teeth. Then, has a series of nightmares where he is chased down by <span class=""yiv1312889235agText"">Hal Itsosis</span>, Ginger Vitas and a gang of life-sized food particles. When he wakes up, he can't wait to floss. We shot the beginning of the video in November, but now need your help raising funds to complete the production.

<br/><br/>As For me, I am <a href=""http://www.vanoodles.com/home.cfm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Van Oodles</a>. I make conscious music for kids and families secretly designed to entertain adults. In addition to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Flossophy 101</span>, I also have other conscientious songs related to health and the environment, our existence and well being as people. A few examples of other songs on my upcoming album (May, 2011) are songs like: <i>Slow Food, I'm Just A Regular Guy</i> (about eating fiber), <i>Veggie Burger Dance, Garden Of Mine</i>, <i>Neti Pot</i>, as well as inspirational songs like <i>Count On Yourself and One Step At A Time.</i>
<br/><br/>As for the video <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Flossophy 101</span>, its true, only between 10-40% of people floss on a daily basis.  I Van Oodles have been flossing everyday since I was sixteen when I realized how weak my gums had become and how the dentist told me that in order to have healthy gums and clean strong teeth, I had to floss every night before bed.  Its also true that one third of your teeth cannot be cleaned by brushing alone and that other crucial 30% (the tooth surface in-between your teeth and below the gum line) is taken care of by flossing.  Flossing helps keep gums strong and breath smelling fresher. The bottom line is: the majority of people don't floss enough.   Fortunately a fun, quirky songwriting musician and performer by the way of Van Oodles wants to change that. The plan is to make a crazy, fun, entertaining and infectious video that will be released virally to the general public, circulated throughout the dental community as well as various networks like mother's clubs etc. and coincide with Van Oodles' conscious kids album release scheduled for mid May 2011. We want people to enjoy it, learn from it, and pass it on to friends and family and circulate it through their networks and communities. The intention and hope is that this video finds its way into the cracks of people's subconscious and eventually between their teeth and under their gum lines.

<h3>Impact</h3>
Something fun, creative and inviting like the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Flossophy 101</span> music video is just the thing to making learning a good time. For kids, the video will make daily flossing a chance for daily dancing, not a chore. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Flossophy 101</span> will lead to better understanding of the importance of flossing as well as make children and adults alike more aware of their own flossing habits.<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

We thought the worst you could hear is you need heart surgery.Well we were wrong. After a week in the hospital they did an xray and then a emergency CT scan. The doctor came in and said we have a incidential find Mr. Castro, you have Lung Cancer. Our lives came crashing down.  They sent him home to heal and to return in 5 weeks for more surgery. In late June a Pet Scan was performed and on July 1, 2011 he had a lobectomy (removal of left upper lung). He was diagnosed with third stage Lung Cancer. He went through 4 month of grueling chemo, which ended the week before Thanksgiving. We were thankful for his life and he was thankful for not losing his hair. Jan 2012 he went through radiation every day for 5 1/2 weeks. Toward the end of radiation he had breathing difficulty and violent coughing. Little did we know the radiation was making him sick. He was diagnosed with Radiation Pneumonitis. He was sick the whole month of March.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sam is a loving husband, father and grandfather. He is a kind and generous man liked by everyone. He is a truck driver for many years.  I hope one day he can return to the job he loves. We were in no way emotionally or financially ready for this process. I don't know anyone who is really ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We need &amp; What you get</p>
<p>Between 2 hospital stays, ICU stay, 2 surgeries, cancer care, chemo, multiple visits to the ER, unscheduled procedures due to infection, pain, radiation etc. He also had five days of infusion of antibiotic for pneumonia. He saw 5 specialists and multiple medications. The debt just keeps on growing.</p>
<p>I started this campaign to help raise $20,000. The money raised will go towards Doctor and Hospital bills. .</p>
<p>You can give whatever you can afford whether its $1 to $50, it will be appreciated and we will be very thankful for you support.</p>

<p> </p></div>","I am Eileen Castro and April 2011 my husband Sam age 55 was hospilized and underwent triple by-pass surgery. We thought the worst you could hear is you need heart surgery.Well we were wrong. After a week in the hospital they did an xray and then a emergency CT scan. The doctor came in and said we have a incidential find Mr. Castro, you have Lung Cancer. Our lives came crashing down.  They sent him home to heal and to return in 5 weeks for more surgery. In late June a Pet Scan was performed and on July 1, 2011 he had a lobectomy (removal of left upper lung). He was diagnosed with third stage Lung Cancer. He went through 4 month of grueling chemo, which ended the week before Thanksgiving. We were thankful for his life and he was thankful for not losing his hair. Jan 2012 he went through radiation every day for 5 1/2 weeks. Toward the end of radiation he had breathing difficulty and violent coughing. Little did we know the radiation was making him sick. He was diagnosed with Radiation Pneumonitis. He was sick the whole month of March.
 
The Impact
Sam is a loving husband, father and grandfather. He is a kind and generous man liked by everyone. He is a truck driver for many years.  I hope one day he can return to the job he loves. We were in no way emotionally or financially ready for this process. I don't know anyone who is really ready.
 
What We need & What you get
Between 2 hospital stays, ICU stay, 2 surgeries, cancer care, chemo, multiple visits to the ER, unscheduled procedures due to infection, pain, radiation etc. He also had five days of infusion of antibiotic for pneumonia. He saw 5 specialists and multiple medications. The debt just keeps on growing.
I started this campaign to help raise $20,000. The money raised will go towards Doctor and Hospital bills. .
You can give whatever you can afford whether its $1 to $50, it will be appreciated and we will be very thankful for you support.

<p>*Transcrandel Magnetic Stimulation *</p>
<p>I have researched and discovered an advanced break-through in the treatment <br/>of depression. Transcrandel Magnetic Stimulation or TMS. Which has been <br/>proven effective in treating otherwise ""treatment resistant depression.""</p>
<p>*Demon of Depression* <br/>* * <br/>My name is Beulah and I have suffered from major depression disorder most <br/>of my adult life and have been declared disabled because of it! I have <br/>tried just about every antidepressant on the market in the last 10 years. <br/>These medications have given me minimal or no relief.</p>
<p>*Depressing Diagnosis*</p>
<p>Therefore the psychiatrist have determined that I have ""treatment resistant <br/>depression"", obviously a very ""depressing diagnosis"" However I am <br/>determined to fight this dibiiltating condition and not give up!</p>
<p>*200 Of You Giving $10.00 *</p>
<p>Can make this happen for me! As this treatment is cost prohibitive, I only <br/>recieve limited disability income and my insurance will not cover it! I <br/>have consulted with The University of South Florida Mental Health Services <br/>where the TMS treatment is administered. They recommend an initial five <br/>treatments to see beneficial results. The cost is $2,000 per treatment at <br/>$10,000.00 total.  I only need you to give 2,000.00 to get me started,as I am seeking other sources for the rest.</p>
<p>So I am asking those of you who can, to help me to recieve the TMS <br/>treatment. Particularly those of you who have suffered with a depression <br/>disorder or know someone who has! This dibilitating disorder saps the <br/>brain of its victims and curtails an otherwise productive life. With your <br/>help I will be able to live my life fully again! Help care for my family <br/>and hopefully return to school to pursue an M.A. in social work.</p></div>","Hello Everyone!

<p>I have been working VERY hard this year creating an exciting new Power Yoga based class that is called Bootie Camp Yoga. This class is non-cardio, yet VERY challenging, &amp; safely targets those hard to get areas... the BUTT &amp; CORE; while emphasizing breath &amp; muscle control, balance, focus &amp; deep opening of the hips &amp; lower back.

<p>Bootie Camp Yoga is taking off so fast that I'm finding it extremely challenging to keep up with the pace of its growth (a good problem to have!). As you can see below, there has been tremendous growth in a very short period of time. I am ready to take this baby on FULL-Time, but need financial assistance to accomplish this, as I continue this journey and make Bootie Camp Yoga a household name. Many people making a small contribution can add up to enough to propel this to its potential. Take a look at my accomplishments in 2012 and then please consider becoming a part of something HUGE!</p>

<p>A few days ago, Bobby was diagnosed with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold%E2%80%93Chiari_malformation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arnold Chiari Malformation</a> after sudden onset of double vision and intense migraine pain. He spent hours in the ER getting MRI's only to be sent home with incorrect information.  The ER doctor misread the MRI and concluded that it was an ""all clear,"" but the next morning he was called with a different diagnosis...<br/><br/> The radiologist noticed right away, that Bobby had a rather drastic malformation of the cerebellum. The Chiari Malformation affects the cerebellum, damaging the brain by applied pressure from the skull as well as starving the brain of its protective spinal fluid. <br/><br/> Bobby's symptoms are snowballing rapidly since his diagnosis. His vision is impaired to the point of needing to wear an eye patch because of the damage done his right eye no longer works in unison with his left. This causes him to see everything in double, the double vision effects his depth perception, equilibrium, and hand eye coordination.  He has also begun having intense migraines, as well as physical tremors. <br/><br/> These symptoms would be awful and life altering for anyone. However, for a man who has spent his entire adult life working in a profession that requires sharp eyes and steady hands this is a catastrophe. Bobby is a tattoo artist, and a body piercer. And without his eyesight and coordination, there is no way for him to safely practice his trade. <br/><br/> The doctors can't tell us for sure whether or not he will ever regain full use of his eye. Even with treatment and surgery, the damage maybe too far gone. This leaves us with thousands of dollars in medical expenses from the surgery, and no guarantee that this will get better. <br/><br/> This is why we need your help. Family, friends, and total strangers are capable of changing what seems to be a no win situation into a miracle.<br/><br/> And that is what we need. A miracle...</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is where he needs your help.</strong></p>
<p>The medical expenses that will be tallied up by the cost of the surgery (potentially multiple surgeries) will easily stretch into the hundreds of thousands. Adding onto that medication costs, cost of living, food, rent, bills which because of his inability to work in this condition, are already beginning to pile up, financially this situation is impossible for a self-employed artist. </p>
<p>Medicaid is a possibility, though not a guarantee, but Medicaid won't help with everyday living expenses for what is, by necessity, an extremely long and painful process and recovery.<br/><br/> So far, simply by being diagnosed he has already accumulated nearly $10,000 in medial expenses. And this is just the beginning of the road... Bobby has a large family and many people that love him, but even with our numbers we can't do this alone. This is more than a physical impairment to him; this changes every aspect of his life.  <br/><br/> We are only hoping to raise enough to allow him to afford to live his life through this ordeal which is expected to last a year or more just with surgery and recovery time. Because of his symptoms he will not be able to take proper care of himself without quite a bit of help. And depending on the rate of his deterioration, we don't know what damage will be permanent and how much of his life he will be able to pick back up. For years, he has dreamed of owning his own tattoo studio however the doctors can’t tell us for sure if that dream has just been destroyed.<br/><br/> We have set this up with flexible funding, so even if our goal isn't met, we can still use every bit to help Bobby through this trying time. Even the smallest donation helps.<br/><br/><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>By donating to this campaign you will be helping to rebuild a life that may have been altered forever.  Some of the things that we will be offering as perks include thank you letters from Bobby and his loved ones, and updates throughout his treatment so you can see the positive impact you are having on not only Bobby, but the people that care about him. Also, t-shirts that we will be making, and signed photographs of Bobby and his family so that you can see all of the people who you have help with your donations.<br/><br/> Bobby has an extremely large, extremely close family, and when one of our group suffers, we all carry the strain...</p>

<p> </p></div>","Why we're here...
A few days ago, Bobby was diagnosed with an Arnold Chiari Malformation after sudden onset of double vision and intense migraine pain. He spent hours in the ER getting MRI's only to be sent home with incorrect information.  The ER doctor misread the MRI and concluded that it was an ""all clear,"" but the next morning he was called with a different diagnosis... The radiologist noticed right away, that Bobby had a rather drastic malformation of the cerebellum. The Chiari Malformation affects the cerebellum, damaging the brain by applied pressure from the skull as well as starving the brain of its protective spinal fluid.  Bobby's symptoms are snowballing rapidly since his diagnosis. His vision is impaired to the point of needing to wear an eye patch because of the damage done his right eye no longer works in unison with his left. This causes him to see everything in double, the double vision effects his depth perception, equilibrium, and hand eye coordination.  He has also begun having intense migraines, as well as physical tremors.  These symptoms would be awful and life altering for anyone. However, for a man who has spent his entire adult life working in a profession that requires sharp eyes and steady hands this is a catastrophe. Bobby is a tattoo artist, and a body piercer. And without his eyesight and coordination, there is no way for him to safely practice his trade.  The doctors can't tell us for sure whether or not he will ever regain full use of his eye. Even with treatment and surgery, the damage maybe too far gone. This leaves us with thousands of dollars in medical expenses from the surgery, and no guarantee that this will get better.  This is why we need your help. Family, friends, and total strangers are capable of changing what seems to be a no win situation into a miracle. And that is what we need. A miracle...
 
This is where he needs your help.
The medical expenses that will be tallied up by the cost of the surgery (potentially multiple surgeries) will easily stretch into the hundreds of thousands. Adding onto that medication costs, cost of living, food, rent, bills which because of his inability to work in this condition, are already beginning to pile up, financially this situation is impossible for a self-employed artist. 
Medicaid is a possibility, though not a guarantee, but Medicaid won't help with everyday living expenses for what is, by necessity, an extremely long and painful process and recovery. So far, simply by being diagnosed he has already accumulated nearly $10,000 in medial expenses. And this is just the beginning of the road... Bobby has a large family and many people that love him, but even with our numbers we can't do this alone. This is more than a physical impairment to him; this changes every aspect of his life.   We are only hoping to raise enough to allow him to afford to live his life through this ordeal which is expected to last a year or more just with surgery and recovery time. Because of his symptoms he will not be able to take proper care of himself without quite a bit of help. And depending on the rate of his deterioration, we don't know what damage will be permanent and how much of his life he will be able to pick back up. For years, he has dreamed of owning his own tattoo studio however the doctors can’t tell us for sure if that dream has just been destroyed. We have set this up with flexible funding, so even if our goal isn't met, we can still use every bit to help Bobby through this trying time. Even the smallest donation helps.What's in it for you?
By donating to this campaign you will be helping to rebuild a life that may have been altered forever.  Some of the things that we will be offering as perks include thank you letters from Bobby and his loved ones, and updates throughout his treatment so you can see the positive impact you are having on not only Bobby, but the people that care about him. Also, t-shirts that we will be making, and signed photographs of Bobby and his family so that you can see all of the people who you have help with your donations. Bobby has an extremely large, extremely close family, and when one of our group suffers, we all carry the strain...
 We understand that of course not everyone will be able to help financially. And that is absolutely fine. EVERYONE can do something; all it takes is sharing the link for the campaign and helping us to raise awareness by using the indigogo share tools. Tell your friends, tell your family, and tell complete strangers like we are... you can help change his life, with just a few kind words and a click of a button.

A smartphone otoscope for accurate diagnosis of ear disease with artificial intelligence
330 million people suffer from ear disease every year - most are children and unable to access accurate diagnosis for treatment.
hearScope - a revolutionary otoscope - significantly improves and alters access to preventative ear care.
 

 
 

Ear infection is one of the most common reasons why kids see a doctor and one of the main causes of hearing loss. If ear disease is not correctly diagnosed early, it can cause permanent hearing loss and even death. A shortage of health providers who can accurately diagnose ear disease is a major reason for these complications. 






To give the world an affordable, user-friendly health care solution that anyone can use as an assistive tool in the diagnosis of ear disease. Our vision is that parents will also be able to capture an image of their child’s eardrum using hearScope. 

 
hearScope's camera and optics allow high-quality video and image footage of the eardrum.

 
We are dedicated to ensuring that anybody can use our solution and that all the technical requirements are met.

Our aim was to have a simple, but functional design, that is compatible with smartphones. We started with a smartphone cover, but soon realized we needed an external device with its own light source and focus. We had to think of every detail of the shape, size, positioning, brightness and focal options. Through many iterations as well as feedback from experts and laypersons we finally aligned the design with our vision of ear health for everyone, everywhere.

A lightweight pen-shaped camera that ensures consistent lighting, exceptional focus and compatibility with most Android smartphones.







 

Promising to revolutionize access to ear care, award-winning hearScope has been developed by the hearX Group who specializes in providing world-first digital hearing health solutions. 

View hearScope images in the cloud on any computer connected to the internet. Share images with patients and colleagues. 

A clear view so you can make a more accurate diagnosis. 
You can now show your patient/parent what you’re seeing during and after examination. 
Variable magnification (1x – 200x). Zoom like never before – detail matters!

High-quality videos offer an unprecedented opportunity to store ear conditions for visual reference (not to mention the academic benefits!) 

 
Multiple specula included. Convenient range of specula included to fit ears of all sizes (ships with 2x 2mm; 2x 3mm; 2x 4mm).



We've successfully developed an Artificial Intelligence Neural Network focused on the diagnosis of outer and middle ear diseases.

I am a 61 year old disabled (person) pensioner
that suffered 6 heart attacks and 2 major heart operations between 2005 and

start a Bush Cottage Guest house to support my disability income. You can view pictures of my safari bush cottage on the gallery page. 
However with my daily disability needs,
medication and medical expenses growing every day I have realized that there
are thousands of disabled and elderly people worldwide that cannot afford a holiday in the African
bush among wild roaming animals nor do they have the opportunity to visit the

toilet and shower facilities, air conditioning, entertainment, transport, Splash Pool and a Professional overhaul of our website etc. We also want to acquire a game viewing vehicle with the necessary
modifications to handle the disabled and elderly . ( example of game viewing vehicle here below ) 

Most of the disabled and elderly person’s family
members are normal healthy people seeking accommodation and accompanying their
disabled family member or friend. I have in the past regrettably declined most

cottage is not wheelchair friendly for disabled persons.
I desperately need contributions (funds) to

<h3>I am opening my own massage clinic to help whole families, including children with special needs and I would love your help! Please and thank you!</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>We currently
live in a world where massage is viewed as a luxury for adults. Actually massage is beneficial for everyone
from premature infants to the elderly, from the fully abled to the disabled and
including those with autism.  We were all
made to enjoy nurturing touch.</span><br/></p>
<p>Massage
stimulates the growth and development of the brain in the very young and in
those with special needs. It also promotes bonding between a parent or
caregiver and a child, soothes the pain of muscle and nerve injuries, brings
comfort to cancer patients, relieves the feelings of stress in PTSD victims and
promotes a feeling of well being in all.</p>
<h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
<p>My name is
Susan Ray and I am a Licensed Massage Therapist. I am the single mother of 3 beautiful
young daughters, one of whom has special needs. I have seen first hand the
benefits of massage for my special needs daughter and her sisters.  I am passionate about helping those with
special needs no matter their age!</p>
<p>I am certified
in Swedish Massage, prenatal, pediatric and autism massage. I will soon be
taking a class with Tina Allen of the Liddle Kidz Foundation to become a
certified teacher of infant massage in order to run classes to teach parents
how to provide soothing touch for their infant. I have experience in working
with clients with sports injuries, sore muscles, arthritis, cancer and those
who just want to shed the tensions of the day. </p>
<p> I’ve been working at a corporate massage chain
but am limited in what I do as they do not work with children and that is my
driving goal. I am very successful where I work and have many clients who
request me and refer their friends to me. I love what I do!  I just want to do more.</p>
<h3><b>My Goal</b></h3>
<p>My vision is
to establish my own clinic where I can work with whole families including
children with special needs, as well as military veterans and others who may
experience PTSD disorders. I have taken a leap of faith and rented a building
to open my own clinic. It needs fresh paint, carpeting, office supplies and
business equipment.  With your financial
support I will be able to open a one of a kind clinic here in East Central
Illinois that provides services for all ages.</p>
<h3><b>The Details</b></h3>
<p>The name of
my business is Agape Hearts and Hands Massage.  Agape (uh-gop-eh) is a Greek word meaning
“unconditional love.”  Loving touch
promotes healing. </p>
<p> October 1, 2014 is my opening date.</p>
<p>I have a
network of professionals who will begin referring clients to me as soon as my
doors are open, including pediatricians, other physicians and nurses, a
military veteran who volunteers to help other veterans with PTSD issues, and
teachers, in addition to friends and family. </p>

<p>We need new carpet, fresh paint, an upgraded computer with
business software, filing cabinets, clipboards, charts for clients, copy paper,
chairs for the waiting room, a music system with soft, soothing music,
decorations for the rooms, and a small table and chairs for the children’s
corner with books and activities. Something I don’t need necessarily but would
love to have is a massage bed with adjustable hydraulic lift for raising and
lowering the clients to make massage easier and more comfortable.</p>
<p>What you get is a warm thank you from me and the other
therapists who will work with me, as well as the satisfaction of knowing that
you are helping special needs children and their families to have therapy that
promotes peace in their households which will assist with bonding and trust in
the families. You can be proud to be a donor to a business that will bring
relief from pain and healing to many from the very young to the elderly. You will be a part of something new and innovative, a trend setter. I will happily keep you informed on the progress of the company and success stories.</p>

<br/><p>The rate of disease and killer viruses around
the world has been increasing since time began. Every generation faces a new
outbreak and a new challenge in the world of human viruses and disease.
Everything from HIV, various forms of cancer and even Ebola have all taken
center stage causing huge distress, loss of lives and frustration within the
medical and healing professions. </p>
<p>Highly regarded Medical Researchers have reported
that Viruses and Bacteria have been mutating into organisms that are resistant
to all modern antibiotics; it would seem that humanity is fighting a losing
battle in the war no disease.</p>
<p><b><i>This Crowdfunding campaign has been launched to
fund research into </i></b><b>the properties of Silver Atoms.  Silver is already known to be <i>anti-viral and anti-bacterial</i> in nature,  no studies have ever been done on Atom Particle Colloidal Silver.  We believe that silver atoms will pave the way in the fight against the emergent strains of the most common viruses.  </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i> </i></b></p>

<h3><u>The Company</u></h3>
<p>GoldenGevity, a company that has been in research and
development of the properties of noble metals since 2005, has put this campaign
together. As a company we have operated in this space for over 10 years and <b>we are in possession of a
proprietary process that can produce atom particles in distilled water without
chemicals.</b></p>
<p>Early on the company carried out research on metals that were
anti cancerous and found that Silver, Platinum, Iridium and Ruthenium were used
to treat Cancer by Healthcare Professionals, and further research uncovered
that silver had been reported to kill well over 650 different viruses including
the HIV virus.</p>
<p><b><i>By testing the efficacy of Silver Atoms and other antioxidant metals, against
viruses and bacteria’s the company will be able to produce ""medical grade"",
colloidal silver atom products which are  already known to be anti-viral and anti-microbial in nature, for the
medical profession and consumers alike, which may lead into further studies on how to apply these products against stubborn viruses and bacteria of which some also cause cancer and other life taking illness's that are caused by stubborn viruses and bacteria.</i></b></p>

very important goals:</b><br/></p>
<p>1.)<span> 
</span>Carry out antimicrobial efficacy testing on 5 to 10 common
viruses</p>
<p>2.)<span> 
</span>Carry out antimicrobial efficacy testing on 5 to 10 common

<p>5.)<span> 
</span>Expand the production capacity of the company by securing
larger facilities, and update the corporate branding with web development and
marketing activities</p>
<p>Even small donations — $10, $25 or $50 — can add up to big
numbers if we all pull together. </p>
<p>Larger amounts like $100, $250 or $500 would help us get there
even faster and will get you your very own high quality Colloidal Silver
products that you can try out for yourself – check out our perks on the right</p>
<p>Won’t you donate what you can today and spread the word to your
family and friends?</p>
<p><b>GoldenGevity’s ground
breaking research will change the game. Lets work together to stop the
suffering – Donate Today!</b></p>
<p>The reasons we are planning this testing is
because part of the problem in developing effective solutions to some of the
most common viruses and bacteria lies in the way the medicines are <i>delivered</i>
into the human body.</p>

<p><b>For decades the standard for dispensing
medicines and even dietary supplements has been:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Micrograms</li>
<li>Milligrams </li>
</ul>
<p>These types of unit may contain trillions of <b><i>total
atoms content,</i></b> which means that they are huge and bulky and cannot be
absorbed by the body easily, nor can they penetrate a virus. The same applies to nano meter, or nano particles.</p>
<p>Viruses and Bacteria size can exceed 200 nm (nano-meters)
or more in size, making the solution very simple:</p>
<p><b><i>The production of single ATOM Particles of elements that are
known to be antiviral and antibacterial, such as Silver, Copper, Zinc, and others.</i></b></p>
<p>At GoldenGevity We have developed a process to
produce high parts per million (PPM) atom size particles of these metals
and other noble elements that by themselves are pure antioxidants in nature.</p>
<p>Because Atoms can seamlessly slide right into
the pathogens at the cellular level, they can produce astonishing, fast results
without any reported side effects. </p>
<p>It would appear that, the atom particle size
supplements are the answer to ever mutating antibiotic resistant strains,
providing for the first time, a real solution to modern medicinal problems. </p>
<p>We know that there is still a long way to go and
hopefully with your help we can complete our crucial testing and take a huge
step forward in the use of noble metals in the treatment of serious viruses and
disease. </p>

<p>As a company, GoldenGevity is a market leader
in the field of Colloidal noble element remedies. We started by selling
colloidal silver 3000 PPM, and as time progressed we added the other elements
and combination of elements.</p>
<p>We were the first to introduce Atom Particle sized Colloidal Silver that:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Have the absolute smallest particle size in the industry...Atoms</li>
<li>Have the Highest Parts Per Million that can be diluted downward.</li>
<li>Have Zero Chemical added from start to finish.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>We then added Gold, Iridium, Platinum, Rhodium, Ruthenium which are known to be pure antioxidants at the core of most plants, fruits, and vegetables, that may have anti cancerous properties and we continue to be #1 in atom particle production of trace mineral dietary supplements.<br/></p>
<h3><u>Noble Metals</u></h3>

<p></p>
<p>We are born with these metals and are found in the body
and when we are low on any of them we may become ill. Many of these noble
metals are also the core elements in natural in herbs and
plants that are often sold over the counter. </p>
<p>Noble Metals especially in atom-sized
particles are not heavy metals, heavy metals are considered to be toxic such as
Lead, Mercury, and others.</p>

<p>Nanotechnology has had a lot of
milestones when it comes to rapidly advancing the ability of humans to
manipulate and use materials at the Nano scale; For instance Nano scale
particles are being developed into mechanical “machines” that can be used for
many industrial and medical applications that are small enough to be tiny
robots that can be controlled externally. </p>
<p><b>But for medicinal and dietary supplement purposes they are quite slow in performance and too large to be assimilated by the human body.</b></p>
<p><span>Silver has antibacterial properties and is
currently being used in consumer products such as socks, washing machines, and
bandages, but still has setbacks since Nano particles can range from 8nm to
200nm and cannot penetrate the pathogens because they are millions if not
trillions of times larger than a single silver atom particle.</span></p>

metals at a size such as Nano particles, milligrams and micro-grams that cannot
penetrate the virus cells or be absorbed efficiently by the body. </p>
<p>GoldenGevity have developed
technology that allows the production of colloidal silver at 3000 particles per
million to well over 18,000 parts per million, and are at least 2,500,000 times
smaller than the smallest Nano particle and possibly billions of times smaller than the largest nano particles, possibly making their solutions thousands of times more effective in the
human body.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 



The rate of disease and killer viruses around
the world has been increasing since time began. Every generation faces a new
outbreak and a new challenge in the world of human viruses and disease.
Everything from HIV, various forms of cancer and even Ebola have all taken
center stage causing huge distress, loss of lives and frustration within the
medical and healing professions. 
Highly regarded Medical Researchers have reported
that Viruses and Bacteria have been mutating into organisms that are resistant
to all modern antibiotics; it would seem that humanity is fighting a losing
battle in the war no disease.
This Crowdfunding campaign has been launched to
fund research into the properties of Silver Atoms.  Silver is already known to be anti-viral and anti-bacterial in nature,  no studies have ever been done on Atom Particle Colloidal Silver.  We believe that silver atoms will pave the way in the fight against the emergent strains of the most common viruses.   

   




The Company
GoldenGevity, a company that has been in research and
development of the properties of noble metals since 2005, has put this campaign
together. As a company we have operated in this space for over 10 years and we are in possession of a
proprietary process that can produce atom particles in distilled water without
chemicals.
Early on the company carried out research on metals that were
anti cancerous and found that Silver, Platinum, Iridium and Ruthenium were used
to treat Cancer by Healthcare Professionals, and further research uncovered
that silver had been reported to kill well over 650 different viruses including
the HIV virus.
By testing the efficacy of Silver Atoms and other antioxidant metals, against
viruses and bacteria’s the company will be able to produce ""medical grade"",
colloidal silver atom products which are  already known to be anti-viral and anti-microbial in nature, for the
medical profession and consumers alike, which may lead into further studies on how to apply these products against stubborn viruses and bacteria of which some also cause cancer and other life taking illness's that are caused by stubborn viruses and bacteria.










This campaign will raise funds to achieve FIVE
very important goals:
1.) 
Carry out antimicrobial efficacy testing on 5 to 10 common
viruses
2.) 
Carry out antimicrobial efficacy testing on 5 to 10 common
bacteria.
3.) 
Carry out Time Analysis of effectiveness of the 10 common
Viruses and Bacteria.
4.)  Carry out
antimicrobial efficacy testing on HIV, Tuberculosis and Hepatitis along with the Time Analysis of effectiveness
of the HIV and Tuberculosis and Hepatitis viruses.
5.) 
Expand the production capacity of the company by securing
larger facilities, and update the corporate branding with web development and
marketing activities
Even small donations — $10, $25 or $50 — can add up to big
numbers if we all pull together. 
Larger amounts like $100, $250 or $500 would help us get there
even faster and will get you your very own high quality Colloidal Silver
products that you can try out for yourself – check out our perks on the right
Won’t you donate what you can today and spread the word to your
family and friends?
GoldenGevity’s ground
breaking research will change the game. Lets work together to stop the
suffering – Donate Today!
The reasons we are planning this testing is
because part of the problem in developing effective solutions to some of the
most common viruses and bacteria lies in the way the medicines are delivered
into the human body.

For decades the standard for dispensing
medicines and even dietary supplements has been:

Micrograms
Milligrams 

These types of unit may contain trillions of total
atoms content, which means that they are huge and bulky and cannot be
absorbed by the body easily, nor can they penetrate a virus. The same applies to nano meter, or nano particles.
Viruses and Bacteria size can exceed 200 nm (nano-meters)
or more in size, making the solution very simple:
The production of single ATOM Particles of elements that are
known to be antiviral and antibacterial, such as Silver, Copper, Zinc, and others.
At GoldenGevity We have developed a process to
produce high parts per million (PPM) atom size particles of these metals
and other noble elements that by themselves are pure antioxidants in nature.
Because Atoms can seamlessly slide right into
the pathogens at the cellular level, they can produce astonishing, fast results
without any reported side effects. 
It would appear that, the atom particle size
supplements are the answer to ever mutating antibiotic resistant strains,
providing for the first time, a real solution to modern medicinal problems. 
We know that there is still a long way to go and
hopefully with your help we can complete our crucial testing and take a huge
step forward in the use of noble metals in the treatment of serious viruses and
disease. 
Check
out the perks on the right and purchase your very own bottle of Colloidal
Silver and see what a difference it will make to your life – and the lives of
millions of others.




As a company, GoldenGevity is a market leader
in the field of Colloidal noble element remedies. We started by selling
colloidal silver 3000 PPM, and as time progressed we added the other elements
and combination of elements.
We were the first to introduce Atom Particle sized Colloidal Silver that:


Have the absolute smallest particle size in the industry...Atoms
Have the Highest Parts Per Million that can be diluted downward.
Have Zero Chemical added from start to finish.


We then added Gold, Iridium, Platinum, Rhodium, Ruthenium which are known to be pure antioxidants at the core of most plants, fruits, and vegetables, that may have anti cancerous properties and we continue to be #1 in atom particle production of trace mineral dietary supplements.
Noble Metals
In chemistry, the noble
metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion and
oxidation in moist air, as opposed to most base metals, the short list comprises:



Ruthenium

Rhodium
Palladium
Silver
Osmium
Iridium
Platinum
Gold.


We are born with these metals and are found in the body
and when we are low on any of them we may become ill. Many of these noble
metals are also the core elements in natural in herbs and
plants that are often sold over the counter. 
Noble Metals especially in atom-sized
particles are not heavy metals, heavy metals are considered to be toxic such as
Lead, Mercury, and others.


About Atoms vs Nanotechnology 

Its All about the Particle
size:




Nanotechnology has had a lot of
milestones when it comes to rapidly advancing the ability of humans to
manipulate and use materials at the Nano scale; For instance Nano scale
particles are being developed into mechanical “machines” that can be used for
many industrial and medical applications that are small enough to be tiny
robots that can be controlled externally. 
But for medicinal and dietary supplement purposes they are quite slow in performance and too large to be assimilated by the human body.
Silver has antibacterial properties and is
currently being used in consumer products such as socks, washing machines, and
bandages, but still has setbacks since Nano particles can range from 8nm to
200nm and cannot penetrate the pathogens because they are millions if not
trillions of times larger than a single silver atom particle.
GoldenGevity’s products

GoldenGevity produces the highest
quality atom sized particles of colloidal silver, gold, and other noble metal products that
can be used for anti-aging and for general health and well-being. 
Most uses of noble metals use the
metals at a size such as Nano particles, milligrams and micro-grams that cannot
penetrate the virus cells or be absorbed efficiently by the body. 
GoldenGevity have developed
technology that allows the production of colloidal silver at 3000 particles per
million to well over 18,000 parts per million, and are at least 2,500,000 times
smaller than the smallest Nano particle and possibly billions of times smaller than the largest nano particles, possibly making their solutions thousands of times more effective in the
human body.
GoldenGevity products are:


Pure
Powerful
Effective
Market
     leaders

Noble metal Products, in particular gold and silver Products,
are among the most extensively studied such-materials and have led to the
development of in-numerous techniques and methods for molecular diagnostics,
imaging, drug delivery and therapeutics. The inclusion of testing of ATOM
particles could have a huge impact on the health of the world’s population.
The world's growing
population demands increasing access to advanced healthcare treatments.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),
the global population will reach over 9 billion by 2050 with nearly 90% of the
world's people located in developing countries.
Biomedical technology is an evolving
field having enormous potential to positively impact the health care system,
through the development of treatments that can penetrate and disarm resistant
strains of viruses and bacteria.
Important biomedical applications of atom
particle technology that may have potential clinical applications include
targeted drug delivery, detection/diagnosis and imaging. 
Basic understanding of how atoms, the
building blocks of the body, interact with the cells and their biological
consequences are evolving, and Noble metal atoms such as gold, silver and Ruthenium
are particularly interesting due to their size and shape and anti-microbial,
and anti-oxidant properties. 






Furthermore, recent investigations are
demonstrating promising application of these atoms as self-therapeutics as
natural dietary supplements. 
To realize the potential promise of these
unique particles for future clinical translation, it is of utmost importance that
further efficacy testing be carried out. With the right level of testing we can
produce medical grade noble metal products that can provide a real solution in
the war on disease. 

Atom Particles and Cancer
Today, 1 in 2 males and 1 in 3 females in the
United States will develop cancer at some point during their lifetimes, and 1
in 4 males and 1 in 5 females in the United States will die from the disease. 
New methods for detection and treatment have
dramatically improved cancer care, however, improved detection and increasing
exposure to carcinogens has led to higher rates of cancer incidence, clinicians
and researchers have not balanced that increase with a similar decrease in
cancer mortality rates even though billions of dollars are poured in through
charity. This mismatch highlights a clear and urgent need for increasingly
potent and selective methods with which to detect and treat cancers at their
earliest stages. 

The unique and newly
discovered properties of noble metal atom particle colloids that may have anti cancerous properties may enhance the specificities
with which bio-medical agents are delivered, possibly complementing their efficacy or
diminishing unintended side effects.
The next waves of studies must include Atom
Particles since size is everything when it comes down to penetrating pathogens
and cancer causing free radicals.
Gold, silver and other noble metals such as
ruthenium afford a particularly unique set of physiological and optical
properties which can be leveraged in applications ranging from in vitro/vivo
therapeutics and drug delivery to imaging and diagnostics, surgical guidance,
and treatment monitoring.
All
of this evidence strongly suggests that the use of noble metals in products such
as colloidal silver atoms can be a great source of treatment against viruses
that are traditionally challenging and produce resistant strains. 
By
increasing our testing and efficacy research with the noble metals we will be
able to join forces with these medical professionals by providing products that
are proven to be effective in the fight against these viruses.

<p>To drink water regularly is a big challenge in
the day-to-day life. Fitkat will help you by calculating how much water you
need, tracking what you drink and gently reminding you when to drink. Your
Guardian and coach can also send you timely reminders to drink water if you
aren’t drinking enough water. These reminders can be a huge benefit to those of
us who regularly turn to soda or coffee/tea for hydration over water.</p>

HELLO TO FITKAT: A SMART BAND THAT TRACKS YOUR DAILY FITNESS PROGRESS AND AN
SOS DEVICE THAT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE




Fitkat
is the only smart band in the world that primarily aims to improve your
health, while keeping you connected to those who are closest to you. The Fitkat
coaches you to adopt a healthier fitness and eating habits. Fitkat not only helps
you stay alive, but it also lets you send and receive social media
alerts, and send out distress alerts to your friends and family if you
need help. With a double click on the SOS button your “Guardians” will receive
your real time location





The main aim of Fitkat is to provide everyone with a simple
and easy tool to use that works as an efficient and user-friendly fitness
tracker. However, we make sure that our product differs from other variations
on the market by giving you even more additions to improve and optimize your
fitness regime. 
The general problem for most people is the tracking of all of
the required changes and figures  that
tend to play a large part in getting fitter – it can all become a little bit
too much for some of us. Well, Fitkat condenses the most important attributes
and stats of the day into one easy-to-use system, making it easier than ever to
actually get fit. 






STAY FIT

Fitkat makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can
track your daily physical activity and review your stats with just a quick glance at your
wrist. Just like a personal trainer, Fitkat guides you to improved wellness by
constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and
your future needs.






STAY HYDRATED

To drink water regularly is a big challenge in
the day-to-day life. Fitkat will help you by calculating how much water you
need, tracking what you drink and gently reminding you when to drink. Your
Guardian and coach can also send you timely reminders to drink water if you
aren’t drinking enough water. These reminders can be a huge benefit to those of
us who regularly turn to soda or coffee/tea for hydration over water.


Benefits of drinking water for your fitness:
* It’s an effective method of combating stress and tiredness.
* Drinking enough water can clear up your skin.
* Drinking enough water can raise your fitness in just a few days.
* It’s beneficial to weight loss and the basic necessity of every professional diet.
* Drinking more water can relieve headaches.



STAY SAFE

Many times, when faced with personal threat, it becomes almost
impossible to take the smartphone out from your pocket or handbag, unlock it,
and send out an emergency message. In such situations, the Fitkat device could
make all the difference in broadcasting that crucial SMS with your location
data to loved ones, with a simple double click on the dedicated SOS button on
the Fitkat device.

<p><span><strong>FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGY IS A FIELD WHICH COULD RE-WRITE THE BOOKS ON THE UNDERSTANDING AND TREATMENT OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE. </strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Who I am and what I do:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Hi, I’m David B. Sullivan and I’m a board-certified chiropractic neurologist. You might have never heard about that term before, but we’ve been around for quite a while. Chiropractic Neurology is basically about understanding the human brain, how it works, why/how it gets diseased, and how to help make it better without using drugs or surgery. </span></p>
<p><strong>I am a founding member of the International Association of Functional Neurology and Rehabilitation (IAFNR). This is the organization that I intend to have my research published through. </strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.frcarrickresearchinstitute.org/memberread"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>International Assoc. of Functional Neurology and Rehabilitation</strong></a></p>
<p><span>Our field has been gaining a lot of exposure in the last few years through some high-profile stories in the news. This type of care was instrumental in the recovery of Pittsburgh Penguin’s star player, Sidney Crosby. It has also been featured on a recent segment of ABC News’ Nightline. This approach to the treatment of neurological disorders has the potential to revolutionize the standard model of care applied to people suffering with neurological diseases. There was even a documentary filmed recently about this type of care. Being a part of that movement, I too am passionate about advancing our understanding and scope, so that we can serve humanity at the highest level possible. </span></p>
<p><span>The founder of this movement, Dr. Frederick Robert Carrick has been quoted as saying: </span></p>
<p><strong>“What was once considered a miracle, is [now] a clinical expectation”</strong></p>
<p>I know first hand what he means by this. I, and my colleagues all around the world witness this each week in our clinics. People that have been suffering without hope are finally coming alive again, regaining function and getting back to normal living with functional neurology. </p>
<p><span><strong>What we’re doing and why it matters:</strong></span></p>
<p>Functional neurology is a way to optoimize brain function without the use of drugs or surgery. It is a revolutionary way to care for neurological illness and we are passionate and dedicated to expanding our reach to the patients who need it most. Our ongoing mission is to establish more evidence, support and understanding of exactly how these treatments work, how to apply them best, and how to get this understanding out to the rest of the scientific and healthcare world. </p>
<p><strong>We need your help in order to carry on this work, and bring this therapy to the rest of the world!! </strong></p>
<p><span>We are part of a movement dedicated toward advancing the science, understanding and knowledge of chronic neurological disease. As a whole, we are actively expanding our access to world-class research facilities, equipment and tools, but there is still a large grass roots effort behind this. In essence, clinics like ours are the front line in developing new ideas, hypotheses and approaches which then feed into larger research efforts. Because clinics like ours are 'in the trenches', we have a first-hand perspective on the conditions that real people live with and suffer with. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Here’s why we need funding and where it will go:</strong></span></p>

</div></div>","FUNCTIONAL NEUROLOGY IS A FIELD WHICH COULD RE-WRITE THE BOOKS ON THE UNDERSTANDING AND TREATMENT OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE. 
Who I am and what I do:
Hi, I’m David B. Sullivan and I’m a board-certified chiropractic neurologist. You might have never heard about that term before, but we’ve been around for quite a while. Chiropractic Neurology is basically about understanding the human brain, how it works, why/how it gets diseased, and how to help make it better without using drugs or surgery. 
I am a founding member of the International Association of Functional Neurology and Rehabilitation (IAFNR). This is the organization that I intend to have my research published through. 
International Assoc. of Functional Neurology and Rehabilitation
Our field has been gaining a lot of exposure in the last few years through some high-profile stories in the news. This type of care was instrumental in the recovery of Pittsburgh Penguin’s star player, Sidney Crosby. It has also been featured on a recent segment of ABC News’ Nightline. This approach to the treatment of neurological disorders has the potential to revolutionize the standard model of care applied to people suffering with neurological diseases. There was even a documentary filmed recently about this type of care. Being a part of that movement, I too am passionate about advancing our understanding and scope, so that we can serve humanity at the highest level possible. 
The founder of this movement, Dr. Frederick Robert Carrick has been quoted as saying: 
“What was once considered a miracle, is [now] a clinical expectation”
I know first hand what he means by this. I, and my colleagues all around the world witness this each week in our clinics. People that have been suffering without hope are finally coming alive again, regaining function and getting back to normal living with functional neurology. 
What we’re doing and why it matters:
Functional neurology is a way to optoimize brain function without the use of drugs or surgery. It is a revolutionary way to care for neurological illness and we are passionate and dedicated to expanding our reach to the patients who need it most. Our ongoing mission is to establish more evidence, support and understanding of exactly how these treatments work, how to apply them best, and how to get this understanding out to the rest of the scientific and healthcare world. 
We need your help in order to carry on this work, and bring this therapy to the rest of the world!! 
We are part of a movement dedicated toward advancing the science, understanding and knowledge of chronic neurological disease. As a whole, we are actively expanding our access to world-class research facilities, equipment and tools, but there is still a large grass roots effort behind this. In essence, clinics like ours are the front line in developing new ideas, hypotheses and approaches which then feed into larger research efforts. Because clinics like ours are 'in the trenches', we have a first-hand perspective on the conditions that real people live with and suffer with. 
Here’s why we need funding and where it will go:
Beyond the humanistic value in this work, research and publishing scientific research takes time, equipment and money. A fair bit of it actually. We are seeking funding of $25,000 in order to advance this effort. 
The funds we raise will go towards purchasing some more sensitive and sophisticated diagnostic, evaluation and treatment equipment to study these therapies in more depth. Our intention is to continue to research these tools so that we understand more completely, what is happening in the brain and why, and how we can use that knowledge for the greatest good of mankind. Our diagnostic equipment and data gathering needs will basically consist of:

Automatic blood pressure cuffs
Pulse oximeter and perfusion indicator
Video nystagmography system
A computer terminal to record video data with
Electric nerve-stimulator devices 
More sensitive scopes and instruments for evaluating nervous system function
Vestibular stimulation apparatus 

Here’s how you can take part in something HUGE:
You have the opportunity here, to be a part of something that could literally end the pain and suffering of millions of people across the world. Think about it- you’re donation to our cause could help end the conditions that thousands or millions of people live with every single day. Your donation could help make the difference between someone living well or suffering needlessly. 
We need your help to make this happen!!
To honor your contributions, we’ve selected a variety of perks to choose from. 
At the most basic level, you’ll receive our undying thanks and appreciation. Higher levels of donation will earn you more personalized thanks as well as some brain related activity books. The PDF version of our initial work will be offered to those who can donate in the mid-ranges, and it only get’s better from there. Subsequent higher levels of donations will earn perks such as being thanked publicly in the acknowledgements of the study, a hard-bound copy of the study, a DVD copy of “Hope Restored: Functional Neurology Serves Humanity”, and even a 1-year membership to the International Association of Functional Neurology and Rehabilitation which also includes 4 quarterly journals. 
If you cannot contribute financially at this time, we understand. But you could still help too!
In lieu of a financial donation, you could help us spread the word about our effort to others so that it might reach people who can. You can also spread the word about Functional Neurology and how this movement is quite literally re-writing the level of care possible for neurological disease. 
Please consider sharing this effort among your contacts, both online and in person. Every person who knows about it can help improve the health of millions of people around the world. If ever there was a chance for you to change the world, this is it. Our hope is that in the years to come, you will see this therapy emerge as a front-line treatment for neurological disease.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Story Time</strong><br/><br/>So, here's the deal. About a month and a half ago, I slipped (very slightly) in the shower, and suddenly I couldn't move my right leg or really stand up straight. It was excruciating. I barely made it out of the shower and into clothes. After laying down on my couch and realizing that I couldn't stand back up again, and feeling the pain get worse and worse, I let someone take me to the ER. I had no reflex in my right leg.</p>
<p>After an MRI, they determined that I had degenerative disc disease, and had herniated a disc in my spine (L4-L5), and had another disc that was getting close to doing the same (L3-L4). I was subsequently sent home with some painkillers and muscle relaxers, and set up with an appointment to see a spine surgeon at a neurospine clinic.</p>
<p>For about two weeks, I could barely get off my couch or walk around. Even painkillers and muscle relaxers and heating pads and ice packs couldn't alleviate the pain. While the injury got somewhat better (I can now walk around, at least) the pain is still incredibly persistent, and the functionality in my right leg (as well as my back) is greatly diminished. My foot will sometimes go entirely numb, and there are often jolts of aching pain down my leg, as well as the pain that is nearly always present in my back.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, I receieved an epidural steroid injection. They shot novacaine into my back, used an xray machine and injected dye to see better, and inserted a large needle filled with a steroid and an anasthetic into the nerve roots attached to my spine. The injection was extremely painful, and incapicitated me for several days. They kept telling me the pain would get worse before it would get better. Well, it did get worse, much worse, for about a week, and then went back to exactly the way it was before the injection.</p>
<p>I am recieving a second injection on Monday, August 6. After that injection, I have to wait two weeks (again, it gets worse before it gets better) and if that doesn't work, I will be referred to a pain management doctor. Surgery is the next step, but they want to wait a little while longer due to the fact that I'm only 22 years old. I also had one appointment with a physical therapist and was told that I should be in physical therapy 3 times a week, which I just couldn't afford.</p>
<p>This injury has been extremely painful and tedious, and extremely expensive. I am 22 years old, on my own, and currently unemployed.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>I really don't need $500 - that's just the minimum amount allowed to create a campaign. My biggest setbacks right now are being able to afford gas to get to all of these appointments, co-pays for the appointments (some are paid for by my parents, but they have almost entirely removed themselves from this situation), and prescription costs.</p>
<p>As of right now, I am not in physical therapy, because I just couldn't afford to make it there and back three times a week. I would really like to go back though, as it not only will help my currently injury, but it will also help prevent future injuries.</p>
<p>I have an injection scheduled on Monday the 6th, a follow-up two weeks later, and an appointment with a pain management specialist shortly after.</p>
<p>I really just want to do anything I can to get this taken care of. It's painful and debilitating, and I just want to be able to lead a more functional and less consistently painful life again.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
If you help me, it would mean the world to me. I've been trying to find work, but with the economy the way it is and having no degree, it's difficult to find work that would accomodate my physical condition right now.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
I swear, I don't just want your money! If you think you could help give me rides to appointments, give me some useful tips and pointers to other ways I can help myself, anything at all, it would be greatly appreciated. Things like food are also very appreciated. It's been hard to get by. <em>Also, any money recieved would be put on a visa gift card or something and used exclusively for health purposes!

<h3>Hi my name is Kristy Lockhart and my best friend has been diagnosed with Lyme Disease. It wasnt until this past year that finally she recieved a proper diagnosis after years of being told a different story every time in a medical visit. <br/>I wish to do everything I can to help her. This is a desperate plea to everybody to please help me financially get her back to the U.S.A for another round of treatment. <br/>In Canada proper testing and treatment are not available. The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late.<br/>The very first visit to the USA that day cost me $1500. Thanks to YOU and your generous donations I was able to provide this for Heather. Monthly treatment (not including her antibiotics) suggested from the lyme doctor is hundreds of dollars on potent specialized probiotics that have to be special ordered, certain vitamins and minerals, supplements as well as a very strict NO yeast/gluten/wheat/yeast/sugar diet. Everyday she has to also juice a variety of greens so her body can absorb the nutrients properly. One teaspoon of sugar/honey/sweetner/etc can suppress Heather's immune system for 6 hours. Also she recieves monthly treatment as well from a wonderful Lyme literate Naturopath.<br/><br/>4 years ago she had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photo shoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, becomes so fatigued far too quickly, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema and this past year she had to go on heart medication as this disease is affecting her heart now.<br/><br/>This woman means everything to me.  I can't put into words how much I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (<a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl</a>) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if her medical treatment is unable to continue.<br/><br/>Donating to this compaign will ensure proper medical care and treatment and lodging while undergoing this care. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1000 every little bit helps. Even if you have no $ to donate, please will you post this on various social networking tools to spread the word?<br/><br/>Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.<br/><br/>She left home at 15 and she has no blood relatives who can help her, and she hasn't worked for the last 3 years due to being so ill. I am a single woman and the ONLY person who has been helping her for years, please can you help me help her?<br/>There is a serious gap in Canada for testing and treatment of this horrible disease. Recently Elizabeth May (MP) introduced a new bill into parliament detailing how this disease should be dealt with.  Bill C-442 is the name of this bill and on May's website the petition to gather support to get this passed into law is available. Lets band together on this and get the treatment/education here in Canada!! This is good for the future, but my friend needs help IMMEDIATELY.<br/>My best friend, Heather, has seen 50 doctors in the last 4 years (including 3 neurosurgeons, infectious disease doctors, rheumetologists, dermotologists, neurologists) which she was left with no definitive answers as to the root cause of all her symptoms, until now. Lyme disease, if not detected in the early stages becomes chronic lyme and ends up attacking the heart, kidneys and liver.<br/><br/>We are givers and this is very hard to ask for help. To prove this, for certain denominations I will print and mail to you your choices from Heather's photography gallery. If you love wildlife and nature or creative works combining the beautiful female form with nature, you are sure to love Heather King's artwork. Side note: there are some pieces on her site which have a filter on them. Please know that nothing was done for shock value. Heather did darker work in her past as a release from brutal physical and sexual abuse.<br/>Please do not place an order through RedBubble as you will be charged for the prints and you have already generously donated to this campaign. Please use Redbubble as a gallery and email me directly what prints you would like.  Any questions or for a list of the prints you would like, please email me here lockhart_ottawa@hotmail.com<br/><br/><br/>I promise you if you were to meet Heather you would love her almost as much as I do.  I have never met another soul with such an enormous loving heart as hers.<br/>Please helps us<br/>love<br/>Kristy</h3>

<p>A dear friend of mine lost his 5 year old son in a terrible bath tub accident. The tragedy and pain of this horrific accident will be felt by his family for years to come. His family is on a fixed income and was certainly not preparing or saving for a funeral. Anything you can donate will go right to the family to help with all the expenses of putting there son to rest. Any funds raised over the ammount needed for funeral expenses will go to a scholarship fund in Canaans name. I will not be able to offer perks for this campaign as it has come out of the blue and is focused on helping a family in need. Anything you can donate will be a huge help. Thank you so much!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY is a <b>S</b>enior <b>A</b>mbient
<b>L</b>iving wellness tracker for keeping tabs on your loved ones recent activity
without any fuss or bother. An elderly parent (or grandparent) can go about
their day in a normal fashion and SALLY will automatically sense and learn
their routine. She is like a good Aunt! </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY's data can be reviewed on an Android or iOS
smartphone or tablet. Only a select circle of relatives or friends receive
real-time updates. The green light means that the individual activity
level for the past several days is constant. When there is a deviation (such as
no activity during a normal busy time or nightly frequent wake ups) an alert
goes out only to those who have access to their wellness status.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I have. My Mom, Shirley, inspired SALLY. What's the most
important thing that comes to YOUR MIND when you think about aging parents or
grandparents?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To us it is PEACE OF MIND. Knowing that 
they are A-Okay. Health and WELLNESS is what we are striving to achieve.
 First at home. Then the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My Mom does NOT want an intrusive device
 SPYING on her! I can't blame her. Shirley, we understand and we really 
do respect your independence.
SALLY is about as obtrusive as our logo. The BUTTERFLY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And we're not alone in liking Butterflies. One of the most
respected B-Corp's in the world - Care2 - shares our sentiments. But better
than that, they believe in what we are trying to accomplish, and that gives us
hope!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The ABC's of Indiegogo SALLY can be 
summed simply, (A) introduce SALLY into your parents life, (B) enhance 
SALLY with a cadre of FRIENDS (accessory products that make SALLY even 
better) and (C) expand SALLY beyond the crowd to the millions of elderly
 living in assisted care facilities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY does not interrupt your parent's 
(or grandparents's) independent lifestyle. There is nothing to learn. 
There are no monthly fees. A daily wellness profile is kept in the cloud
 and can be reviewed at your leisure.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434360284/i20hlxyua4lu0uui2ty4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Did you say there are no monthly 
fees? Yes, we did. And we wish to be crystal clear on this point. 
SALLY is NOT a subscription model. SALLY is a WYSIWYG (what you see is 
what you get) model. Plug her in and she goes to work. Bingo! No fees. 
Ever.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oh, and one more thing. SALLY will have FRIENDS in the future. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What are FRIENDS and what kind of 
FRIENDS will SALLY have? FRIENDS are products that work in 
conjunction with SALLY. Increasing WELLNESS is the name of their game. 
They watch over your family so you know they are safe. And only alert 
you when they sense something is wrong.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A key feature coming soon is voice 
messaging to notify your parents when they need to take action. A 
friendly reminder can make all the difference.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A sampling of the FRIENDS offered in the
 future includes a variety of products, Life-Band, Pill Dispenser, Blood
 Pressure, Weight Scale, Gas Detector, Respiration Monitor, Fire Alarm 
and more. For more information zoom down to the FAQ's section. But be 
sure to zoom back up!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our VISION is to establish SALLY, expand
 the Wellness Circle with FRIENDS and ultimately address the elderly 
seniors residing in Assisted Living Facilities. To achieve our VISION we
 must start with early success in a much smaller space. Those busy 
individuals who CARE enough to take action to increase WELLNESS with 
their aging parents. Without your support we cannot help the many 
seniors (everybody has parents) at home and at care facilities who could
 benefit from having SALLY in their life.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our goal is to start small. In the home. With products that keep your parents safe!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Good ideas
need to start where they have the chance to grow. They need care and
nourishment. Just like you did when you were small.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ideas and
products need to be time tested. If you care about creating long-term
value you need to enlist an army of dedicated people who really care. Apple could
never have been Apple without MacHeads. Providing technology is easy. Providing
wellness is hard. We need your help to get this right. This is not a geeky
gadget. This is real. And you would be helping to provide the maximum well
being to the greatest number of seniors. Now that's something we can all feel
good about.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our next step to achieving SALLY VISION 
is to add FRIENDS. Expanding wellness within the home environment. This 
will give us a platform to prove the efficacy of our VISION. Once proven
 we plan to expand way beyond a single home with your parents. SALLY 
wants to provide Wellness Care to the millions of adults living in 
various types of assisted  living and care facilities.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The primary places where people live besides their own home as they age are:</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With your help we can expand SALLY to 
reach Beyond the Crowd. For more information about our VISION to expand 
WELLNESS to Seniors everywhere, be sure to check out our SALLY Community
 - Let's Work Together section.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Together we can make SALLY stronger 
(better able to predict and keep senior adults healthy) with FRIENDS, 
and expansive (getting to everywhere seniors are, home or assisted 
living, with improved algorithms). Over time, as your SALLY Community 
grows, the ability to collect and analyze massive amounts of information
 that benefit every individual within the community becomes a reality. 
We believe in a better future. For your parents. For everyone's parents.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It takes a village to raise a child. It takes a community to care for the elderly.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We built SALLY for professionals on
 the go that want or need to be aware of their aging parents condition. 
The good news is that they live on their own. Independence is great. 
Hooray! We're all for it. But that can also be bad news. If something 
goes wrong. Sometimes all you need to see is the green screen on your 
smartphone or tablet for that peace of mind.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY is our first product aimed at 
improving senior lifestyles with simple yet effective products. Our team
 has successfully designed a variety of video and IoT products in the 
past. Leveraging our capability gives us a 99% chance of technical 
success on SALLY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We launched a successful Kickstarter 
campaign last autumn. The STACK Box was an IoT gateway that was 
comparable in complexity to SALLY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The use of funds is primarily for 
manufacturing costs to fulfill orders. The design and tooling 
specifications have already been made. If we don't succeed on raising 
the requisite amount we intend to introduce the product anyways. But if 
we do a successful rollout of SALLY on Indiegogo, then we plan a 
continuous rolling rollout of FRIENDS to enhance the value of SALLY.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The symbol of the butterfly conveys many
 meanings. The butterfly is loved and admired by the young and the old. 
Butterflies are delicate, they are the result of a transformation from a
 caterpillar to become something quite beautiful. With wings they have 
explored the world. In some ways, they represent ourselves as we age. 
Exploring and seeing much, but in the process becoming fragile.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Emulating the butterfly by providing 
products that promote wellness but never intrude on independence is our 
mission. Butterflies are free and inspiring.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So get behind SALLY now to accelerate 
the arrival of her FRIENDS. Just as you can never have too many good 
friends, the same hold's true with SALLY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY works fine without FRIENDS. But 
with FRIENDS she will be able to provide more wellness. But more than 
that, acting as companion devices to SALLY, her FRIENDS create a 
virtuous circle of wellness. The whole is greater than the sum of the 
parts. Things Fall Together. You can learn more about SALLY's FRIENDS in
 our FAQs section.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our longer-term goal is to keep 
expanding this Virtuous Circle with more and more FRIENDS for SALLY. 
When the network of people reaches a critical mass we will attain the 
virtual equivalent of a rocket lifting off from Earth to discover outer 
space. Suddenly everything changes. What do we mean by that? </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A good question. Fair enough.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To accurately pinpoint problems before 
they become manifest requires both quality and quantity of data. A 
variety of key markers along with proper algorithms can predict behavior
 quite accurately by analyzing data.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But there is a law of diminishing 
return. In addition to parsing massive amounts of data to create value. 
To keep making quantum leaps in wellness requires better quality of 
data. And that's where SALLY's FRIENDS come in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Early Detection (the other ED) can be the difference between life and death.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY the Wellness Tracker gathers data 
activity 24/7. She is a peace of mind device that is simple to setup. 
Just set SALLY down, plug her in let her go to work! The more data SALLY
 tracks the better she becomes at predicting problems before they become
 apparent, even to the person at risk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The more data SALLY tracks the better she becomes. All of the data is saved and stored securely. In both SALLY and the cloud.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What is the cloud? The cloud is a 
fancy name for a datacenter. For example, Amazon keeps and stores it's 
data about you on their own private cloud. You cannot view anyone else's
 information. This is the same thing except now you are in control of 
access to the data.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Only the approved circle of friends and 
family members can view it.  With the mobile app it can be viewed on a 
smartphone or tablet virtually anywhere.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With SALLY you can be on your way to a busy conference but still know that your parents or grandparents are safe and sound.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For seniors a change in ambient motion can be a sign of trouble ahead.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY sits on their bedroom dresser
 and simply learns the activity routine. Most of the time if 
the daily routine does not change then all is fine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY is not a medical device.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Hi, I'm SALLY, what would you like to know about me?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>My parents are old. They are put off by technology. How can I be sure they will like SALLY?</b><br/>Good question. Tell Mom and Dad that all they need to do is plug me in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Does SALLY stand for anything?</b><br/>Yes, I am a cute name for Senior Ambient Living.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What does a Senior Ambient Living device do?</b><br/>It
 is a device that tracks your parent’s motion as they walk by. The ideal
 place for SALLY to sit is on your parent’s dresser. She should sit at 
mid-height so she captures their torso. A green lights means the motion 
is normal. The light will turn amber and then red the further away from 
normal. The wellness tracker logs each day’s normal walking motion. This
 data is then sent to the cloud. From the cloud you can check the status
 of Mom (and/or Dad, or whomever).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Okay, SALLY is on the dresser at mid-height. But where exactly?</b><br/>SALLY
 works best when placed on the bedroom dresser with the sensor pointing 
to a high traffic area. Make sure SALLY is higher than any pet traffic. A
 wide angle view will produce the best results. Once you find the right 
position, do not move.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What if my parents don't have access to the internet?</b><br/>For
 parents in the USA that lack an online network at home we can propose 
FreedomPop 3G/4G free solution. SALLY uses minimal broadband bandwidth. 
Typical usage is less than ten mega-bytes a month.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Will SALLY really bring me peace of mind?</b><br/>Yes!
 Say you are on the go and have a business meeting to attend. By simply 
viewing a smartphone or tablet you can tell your parents status at a 
glance with the simplest of all symbols. A green dot lets you know 
everything is fine.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What if the dot is not green?</b><br/>If
 the dot is changing color towards red, then you know the wellness 
tracker is telling you that things are not normal. It could be something
 as simple as SALLY got jolted and is not viewing at the same angle. Or 
it could mean something more serious occurred.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Will SALLY contact me if the wellness tracker detects aberrant behavior?</b><br/>There
 will not be an
S.O.S. in SALLY. She is merely a tracker. An event, such as a fall, does
 not trigger an action for now. But one of SALLY’s future FRIENDS, the 
Life-Band (our next product) will send out an S.O.S. signal.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Does SALLY really have FRIENDS?</b><br/>Not
 yet. But we are cooking up a whole lot of ideas. We like to call them 
FRIENDS of SALLY. Any group of FRIENDS can work with SALLY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What will SALLY's FRIENDS do?</b><br/>SALLY
 works in the bedroom where she tracks your parent's daily ambient 
motion. Her FRIENDS will extend the range to the whole house and 
beyond. The basic idea is to extend wellness to many aspects of a 
person's life. Notification of a fall and proper pill medication are 
primary goals. Beyond that is a consistent way of monitoring healthy 
vital signs such as respiration, blood pressure and weight. The 
environment is then included into the mix, fire alarms and gas sensors. 
And more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Will SALLY have a lot of FRIENDS?</b><br/>That
 depends on you. For right now, there are enough FRIENDS on the drawing 
board that along with SALLY they could make up a baseball team. This is a
 good analogy too. Working together as a team, SALLY and her FRIENDS, 
will keep your parents and grandparents safe and sound. But again, to 
realize the DREAM requires help from all of you. Our ultimate VISION is 
to reach out to Assisted Living Facilities and extend the algorithm to 
Big Data analytics.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Can I choose to add only the FRIENDS that I want?</b><br/>Of
 course! To add any one or all of SALLY’s FRIENDS is a snap. SALLY is 
the queen butterfly who directs all of her FRIENDS data to the cloud.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>If I ask nicely, can you give me a sneak preview about SALLY's FRIENDS?</b><br/>Oh, all right. Since you read this far and have been ever so nice.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Future
 FRIENDS include a Life-Band (which triggers an S.O.S. when an event, 
such as a fall takes place). The Life-Band extends the range beyond the 
house or garden. All of SALLY's FRIENDS communicate to the cloud through
 SALLY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another
 FRIEND is the Pill Dispenser that ensures that all medications are 
taken in the right dosage and at the proper time. An audio notification 
alert is made when your parent is within range that now is the time to 
take their medicine. As we age, we tend to forget more easily. We 
believe that one day your Pill Dispenser will become Indispensable, as 
today are cars and TVs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A smart Blood Pressure device and a smart Weight Scale are other FRIENDS.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Respiration
 monitoring, Gas sensors (carbon monoxide) and Fire alarm are on the 
list. We welcome input suggestions from our Contributors!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY
 is the hub of a bicycle wheel and the number of spokes that can be 
added is only limited by the power of imagination. We love Power Laws!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Future FRIENDS from 3rd party partners may connect to SALLY as well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SALLY
 is FRIEND friendly! Feel free to contact us with ideas so we can work 
together. We suspect the best ideas will come from non-technical people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bring
 us your ideas. We will take care of the technology. And share the 
rewards. If SALLY succeeds we'll need to hire more caring and creative 
people.</p>
<p style=""height: 5px;""></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MANUFACTURING:
 New tooling to manufacture gadgets and ensure reliability is
expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. Manufacturing 
partners that you have a long history with is in our mind, necessary and
 prudent; only through experience can you establish trust.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
To minimize risk we're working with manufacturing partners that we have a
 long track record for quality, on-time delivery and reliability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As our wellness tracker SALLY gets geared up 
for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve 
the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine
 the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those 
suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. We try always to 
benefit of you the consumer and will let you know exactly how and why 
any changes are made.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">FULFILLMENT:
No
 matter how much thought, care and effort go into the planning of a 
product, we have learned through hands-on experience to always expect 
the unexpected. Murphy’s Law is alive and well in the world of 
manufacturing. Deadlines are missed, machines break and packages
get lost in the mail. Any mishap can cause serious delays.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">RISK
 MANAGEMENT: We
minimize the risk of one setback having a serious impact on our delivery
 schedule. Multiple suppliers with years of working together shoulder to
 shoulder mitigates any serious delay. Our manufacturing partners have 
known working experience with us to deliver excellent products without 
delay or sacrificing quality. Obstacles are met head-on and addressed by
 combining our internal knowledge with their external expertise with the
 goal of delighting our customers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Any
 pledge amount brings us one step closer to achieving our goal. Become 
part of the SALLY Community, first by checking us out, then by backing 
us and ultimately by becoming an active participant. Our wellness 
tracker SALLY is a living product that improves with age! We believe in a
 better future. Please help us get the word out about SALLY and THANK 
YOU for your assistance</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Partnering
 with us, together we can build a SALLY Community of people that want to

</div></div>","Who's Sally?


SALLY is a Senior Ambient
Living wellness tracker for keeping tabs on your loved ones recent activity
without any fuss or bother. An elderly parent (or grandparent) can go about
their day in a normal fashion and SALLY will automatically sense and learn
their routine. She is like a good Aunt! 
SALLY's data can be reviewed on an Android or iOS
smartphone or tablet. Only a select circle of relatives or friends receive
real-time updates. The green light means that the individual activity
level for the past several days is constant. When there is a deviation (such as
no activity during a normal busy time or nightly frequent wake ups) an alert
goes out only to those who have access to their wellness status.


I have. My Mom, Shirley, inspired SALLY. What's the most
important thing that comes to YOUR MIND when you think about aging parents or
grandparents?
To us it is PEACE OF MIND. Knowing that 
they are A-Okay. Health and WELLNESS is what we are striving to achieve.
 First at home. Then the world.
My Mom does NOT want an intrusive device
 SPYING on her! I can't blame her. Shirley, we understand and we really 
do respect your independence.
SALLY is about as obtrusive as our logo. The BUTTERFLY.
And we're not alone in liking Butterflies. One of the most
respected B-Corp's in the world - Care2 - shares our sentiments. But better
than that, they believe in what we are trying to accomplish, and that gives us
hope!






The ABC's of Indiegogo SALLY can be 
summed simply, (A) introduce SALLY into your parents life, (B) enhance 
SALLY with a cadre of FRIENDS (accessory products that make SALLY even 
better) and (C) expand SALLY beyond the crowd to the millions of elderly
 living in assisted care facilities.
SALLY does not interrupt your parent's 
(or grandparents's) independent lifestyle. There is nothing to learn. 
There are no monthly fees. A daily wellness profile is kept in the cloud
 and can be reviewed at your leisure.



Did you say there are no monthly 
fees? Yes, we did. And we wish to be crystal clear on this point. 
SALLY is NOT a subscription model. SALLY is a WYSIWYG (what you see is 
what you get) model. Plug her in and she goes to work. Bingo! No fees. 
Ever.
Oh, and one more thing. SALLY will have FRIENDS in the future. 
What are FRIENDS and what kind of 
FRIENDS will SALLY have? FRIENDS are products that work in 
conjunction with SALLY. Increasing WELLNESS is the name of their game. 
They watch over your family so you know they are safe. And only alert 
you when they sense something is wrong.
A key feature coming soon is voice 
messaging to notify your parents when they need to take action. A 
friendly reminder can make all the difference.






A sampling of the FRIENDS offered in the
 future includes a variety of products, Life-Band, Pill Dispenser, Blood
 Pressure, Weight Scale, Gas Detector, Respiration Monitor, Fire Alarm 
and more. For more information zoom down to the FAQ's section. But be 
sure to zoom back up!
Our VISION is to establish SALLY, expand
 the Wellness Circle with FRIENDS and ultimately address the elderly 
seniors residing in Assisted Living Facilities. To achieve our VISION we
 must start with early success in a much smaller space. Those busy 
individuals who CARE enough to take action to increase WELLNESS with 
their aging parents. Without your support we cannot help the many 
seniors (everybody has parents) at home and at care facilities who could
 benefit from having SALLY in their life.





Our goal is to start small. In the home. With products that keep your parents safe!
Good ideas
need to start where they have the chance to grow. They need care and
nourishment. Just like you did when you were small.
Ideas and
products need to be time tested. If you care about creating long-term
value you need to enlist an army of dedicated people who really care. Apple could
never have been Apple without MacHeads. Providing technology is easy. Providing
wellness is hard. We need your help to get this right. This is not a geeky
gadget. This is real. And you would be helping to provide the maximum well
being to the greatest number of seniors. Now that's something we can all feel
good about.


Our next step to achieving SALLY VISION 
is to add FRIENDS. Expanding wellness within the home environment. This 
will give us a platform to prove the efficacy of our VISION. Once proven
 we plan to expand way beyond a single home with your parents. SALLY 
wants to provide Wellness Care to the millions of adults living in 
various types of assisted  living and care facilities.
The primary places where people live besides their own home as they age are:







With your help we can expand SALLY to 
reach Beyond the Crowd. For more information about our VISION to expand 
WELLNESS to Seniors everywhere, be sure to check out our SALLY Community
 - Let's Work Together section.
Together we can make SALLY stronger 
(better able to predict and keep senior adults healthy) with FRIENDS, 
and expansive (getting to everywhere seniors are, home or assisted 
living, with improved algorithms). Over time, as your SALLY Community 
grows, the ability to collect and analyze massive amounts of information
 that benefit every individual within the community becomes a reality. 
We believe in a better future. For your parents. For everyone's parents.
It takes a village to raise a child. It takes a community to care for the elderly.
We built SALLY for professionals on
 the go that want or need to be aware of their aging parents condition. 
The good news is that they live on their own. Independence is great. 
Hooray! We're all for it. But that can also be bad news. If something 
goes wrong. Sometimes all you need to see is the green screen on your 
smartphone or tablet for that peace of mind.



All SALLY needs is a little love from you!
SALLY is our first product aimed at 
improving senior lifestyles with simple yet effective products. Our team
 has successfully designed a variety of video and IoT products in the 
past. Leveraging our capability gives us a 99% chance of technical 
success on SALLY.
We launched a successful Kickstarter 
campaign last autumn. The STACK Box was an IoT gateway that was 
comparable in complexity to SALLY.
The use of funds is primarily for 
manufacturing costs to fulfill orders. The design and tooling 
specifications have already been made. If we don't succeed on raising 
the requisite amount we intend to introduce the product anyways. But if 
we do a successful rollout of SALLY on Indiegogo, then we plan a 
continuous rolling rollout of FRIENDS to enhance the value of SALLY.

Why Did We Choose A Butterfly Logo?
The symbol of the butterfly conveys many
 meanings. The butterfly is loved and admired by the young and the old. 
Butterflies are delicate, they are the result of a transformation from a
 caterpillar to become something quite beautiful. With wings they have 
explored the world. In some ways, they represent ourselves as we age. 
Exploring and seeing much, but in the process becoming fragile.



Emulating the butterfly by providing 
products that promote wellness but never intrude on independence is our 
mission. Butterflies are free and inspiring.

We're Lighting Out For The Frontier and Taking our VISION with us!
So get behind SALLY now to accelerate 
the arrival of her FRIENDS. Just as you can never have too many good 
friends, the same hold's true with SALLY.
SALLY works fine without FRIENDS. But 
with FRIENDS she will be able to provide more wellness. But more than 
that, acting as companion devices to SALLY, her FRIENDS create a 
virtuous circle of wellness. The whole is greater than the sum of the 
parts. Things Fall Together. You can learn more about SALLY's FRIENDS in
 our FAQs section.
Our longer-term goal is to keep 
expanding this Virtuous Circle with more and more FRIENDS for SALLY. 
When the network of people reaches a critical mass we will attain the 
virtual equivalent of a rocket lifting off from Earth to discover outer 
space. Suddenly everything changes. What do we mean by that? 
A good question. Fair enough.
To accurately pinpoint problems before 
they become manifest requires both quality and quantity of data. A 
variety of key markers along with proper algorithms can predict behavior
 quite accurately by analyzing data.
But there is a law of diminishing 
return. In addition to parsing massive amounts of data to create value. 
To keep making quantum leaps in wellness requires better quality of 
data. And that's where SALLY's FRIENDS come in.
Early Detection (the other ED) can be the difference between life and death.




SALLY the Wellness Tracker gathers data 
activity 24/7. She is a peace of mind device that is simple to setup. 
Just set SALLY down, plug her in let her go to work! The more data SALLY
 tracks the better she becomes at predicting problems before they become
 apparent, even to the person at risk.
The more data SALLY tracks the better she becomes. All of the data is saved and stored securely. In both SALLY and the cloud.
What is the cloud? The cloud is a 
fancy name for a datacenter. For example, Amazon keeps and stores it's 
data about you on their own private cloud. You cannot view anyone else's
 information. This is the same thing except now you are in control of 
access to the data.
Only the approved circle of friends and 
family members can view it.  With the mobile app it can be viewed on a 
smartphone or tablet virtually anywhere.
With SALLY you can be on your way to a busy conference but still know that your parents or grandparents are safe and sound.
For seniors a change in ambient motion can be a sign of trouble ahead.
SALLY sits on their bedroom dresser
 and simply learns the activity routine. Most of the time if 
the daily routine does not change then all is fine.
SALLY is not a medical device.

board that along with SALLY they could make up a baseball team. This is a
 good analogy too. Working together as a team, SALLY and her FRIENDS, 
will keep your parents and grandparents safe and sound. But again, to 
realize the DREAM requires help from all of you. Our ultimate VISION is 
to reach out to Assisted Living Facilities and extend the algorithm to 
Big Data analytics.
Can I choose to add only the FRIENDS that I want?Of
 course! To add any one or all of SALLY’s FRIENDS is a snap. SALLY is 
the queen butterfly who directs all of her FRIENDS data to the cloud.
If I ask nicely, can you give me a sneak preview about SALLY's FRIENDS?Oh, all right. Since you read this far and have been ever so nice.
Future
 FRIENDS include a Life-Band (which triggers an S.O.S. when an event, 
such as a fall takes place). The Life-Band extends the range beyond the 
house or garden. All of SALLY's FRIENDS communicate to the cloud through
 SALLY.
Another
 FRIEND is the Pill Dispenser that ensures that all medications are 
taken in the right dosage and at the proper time. An audio notification 
alert is made when your parent is within range that now is the time to 
take their medicine. As we age, we tend to forget more easily. We 
believe that one day your Pill Dispenser will become Indispensable, as 
today are cars and TVs.
A smart Blood Pressure device and a smart Weight Scale are other FRIENDS.
Respiration
 monitoring, Gas sensors (carbon monoxide) and Fire alarm are on the 
list. We welcome input suggestions from our Contributors!
SALLY
 is the hub of a bicycle wheel and the number of spokes that can be 
added is only limited by the power of imagination. We love Power Laws!
Future FRIENDS from 3rd party partners may connect to SALLY as well.
SALLY
 is FRIEND friendly! Feel free to contact us with ideas so we can work 
together. We suspect the best ideas will come from non-technical people.
Bring
 us your ideas. We will take care of the technology. And share the 
rewards. If SALLY succeeds we'll need to hire more caring and creative 
people.

Risks & Challenges
MANUFACTURING:
 New tooling to manufacture gadgets and ensure reliability is
expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. Manufacturing 
partners that you have a long history with is in our mind, necessary and
 prudent; only through experience can you establish trust.

To minimize risk we're working with manufacturing partners that we have a
 long track record for quality, on-time delivery and reliability.

PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As our wellness tracker SALLY gets geared up 
for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve 
the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine
 the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those 
suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. We try always to 
benefit of you the consumer and will let you know exactly how and why 
any changes are made.
FULFILLMENT:
No
 matter how much thought, care and effort go into the planning of a 
product, we have learned through hands-on experience to always expect 
the unexpected. Murphy’s Law is alive and well in the world of 
manufacturing. Deadlines are missed, machines break and packages
get lost in the mail. Any mishap can cause serious delays.
RISK
 MANAGEMENT: We
minimize the risk of one setback having a serious impact on our delivery
 schedule. Multiple suppliers with years of working together shoulder to
 shoulder mitigates any serious delay. Our manufacturing partners have 
known working experience with us to deliver excellent products without 
delay or sacrificing quality. Obstacles are met head-on and addressed by
 combining our internal knowledge with their external expertise with the
 goal of delighting our customers.
Any
 pledge amount brings us one step closer to achieving our goal. Become 
part of the SALLY Community, first by checking us out, then by backing 
us and ultimately by becoming an active participant. Our wellness 
tracker SALLY is a living product that improves with age! We believe in a
 better future. Please help us get the word out about SALLY and THANK 
YOU for your assistance

Other Ways You Can Help
You can always contribute to a great cause by simply referring friends:

Step 1 - spread the word through your Facebook contacts
Step 2 - with a click your friends will be at our Indiegogo site
Step 3 - you can always reach SALLY at www.sallyiot.com
And that's all there is to it. Friends that have aging parents 
will thank you for it. You gave them the best gift they could ever have.
 Peace of Mind.


Thank You Everyone, We Really Appreciated Your Support!
Partnering
 with us, together we can build a SALLY Community of people that want to
 use technology for good. This project was conceived by the need to 
preserve Shirley's independence after the loss of her beloved husband, 
Chick.
Our goal is to make sure that all the Shirley's out
there in the world are living and loving life while all of their loved ones
know that they are safe and sound.


Keeping safe those they love. The peace of mind knowing
that there are no problems today or on the horizon. And when they do crop up,
as they invariably do, you are prepared to take action.
We want to send a special thank you to all of our
alpha-beta testers, guinea pigs, caring customers, wise advisors, trusty
mentors, close friends and loving family participants. Without you

Nextion is mainly applied to IoT or consumer electronics field. It is the best solution to replace the traditional LCD and LED Nixie tube.</p><p>This solution includes hardware part - a series of TFT boards and software part - Nextion editor.  Nextion TFT board uses only one serial port to do communicating. Let you get rid of the wiring trouble. We notice that most engineers spend much time in application development but get unpleasant results. In this situation, Nextion editor has mass components such as button, text, progress bar, slider, instrument panel etc. to enrich your interface design. And the drag-and-drop function ensures that you spend less time in programming, which will reduce your 99% development workloads. With the help of this WYSIWYG editor, GUI designing is a piece of cake.</p><p>We believe that your dozen days developing a complex HMI can be done in couple hours by using Nextion.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1401387/files/20150420235504-nextion43.jpg?1429599304"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h1>If You Are...</h1><p><b>Maker/Developer</b> – Worry about spending time in learning programming the TFT when you start to undertake an interactive interface design?

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<div>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use Nextion as a common TFT LCD?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. Nextion supports GUI commands including drawing a dot or a line, filling solid color, showing a picture etc. You can connect the MCU through UART, and let the MCU control Nextion via GUI commands.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is Nextion touchable?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. Nextion adopts resistive screen, supporting single-touch point, not support the multi-touch like capacitive screen. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the refresh rate of Nextion TFT boards?</strong></p>
<p>A: The refresh rate of Nextion 2.4” is controlled by GPU, the speed is 80ms per frame. The refresh rate of Nextion 4.3” is controlled by GPU and RGB buffer, the speed is 20ms per frame.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I ask you to customize the layout and location hole of Nextion TFT boards?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes. We provide custom Nextion. But only offer the customization of Nextion layout, location hole, and interface.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Q: Except 2.4” and 4.3”, what else screen size you provide?</strong></p>
<p>A: We now only provide 2.4 and 4.3 size. We will develop Nextion 2.8” and 3.2” if this project is very welcome on Indiegogo. If everything goes well, it is expected that they will be on the market in October. Before then, we only produce and sell Nextion 2.4” and 4.3”</p>
<p><strong>Q: How many OS does Nextion Editor support?</strong></p>
<p>A: Only Windows support now. If the crow-funding successes,  we will develop multi-platform

<p><strong>Summary of the Program</strong></p>
<p>The iRacing motorsport racing simulation is a popular and ultra realistic racing simulation with over 35 thousand active members living worldwide.  Simulated PC auto racing is an activity enjoyed by millions of players, and iRacing offers the most realistic auto racing experience found short of actually being on a real life race track.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it lacks an option which many who enjoy the service would want.  Heretofore, there has existed no option for some users who may want to monitor critical engine and other data on a screen separate from the one(s) displaying the racing which is not pricey or which requires another, external hardware device.  Moreover, some users actually cannot see their gauge displays for the reason that those with multiple screens may not be able to fit into them their car's virtual dashboard when the most realistic view settings are used.</p>
<p>The iRacing Data Display Unit, iRDDU for short, will give the iRacing enthusiast exactly what is lost under many circumstances...and it's FREE!  It will function on any monitor, and many sim racing fans have multiple monitors connected to their PC system.</p>
<p>We’re proud to have assembled a team of motivated, enthusiastic and EXPERIECNED programmers who have all the skills needed to make this program a reality.  Our collective sim racing experiences spans many decades.  Our lead developer was very active with creating a very popular program for Grand Prix Legends - iRacing's progenitor - and his program is even remaining in service with the most loyal GPL fans.</p>
<p>Paul Thurston developed GEM+ for Grand Prix Legends.  GEM+ was used at its height by more than 10,000 users – a time when sim racing started becoming popular and was a program which allowed Grand Prix Legends users virtually unlimited control over their software settings and parameters.  It not only made the title more efficient, but it also gave the fan base a tool with which they could enjoy their racing experience that much more fully.  GEM+ still remains in active service for some – many years later.</p>
<p>Paul’s role as the Executive Developer and lead programmer of the Data Display Unit for iRacing ensures that the program will deliver precisely as promised, and it’s his effort which has brought this project to reality.  Indeed there is no better man for the task.</p>
<p>Derek Speare Designs is a sim racing component manufacturer who has thousands of customers worldwide.  The DSD name is known by many sim racers to deliver quality, value and service unparalleled.  Derek Speare is the Program Facilitator and one of the Corporate Benefactors of the iRDDU effort.  Derek’s dedication to service is unmatched, and all who know him know he delivers.  Derek’s role in the project is not for compensation, and as a Corporate Benefactor, he has pledged his own funds as such to support the development process.</p>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo is an excellent venue for which to generate investment capital and exposure for the iRDDU.  The iRDDU will be freeware, and since programmers must be paid, there is every reason to ask for the community to support the development of it. </p>

<h2><span>SKINLUMINA</span></h2>
<p><b><i>Giving
YOU Control</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A
significant trend in the skin care and beauty market today is a high demand for
home use medical devices.  Both woman and
men alike want the convenience of a home-use medical device provided it can
offer the significant results associated with in-office medical
treatments.  Consumers want to be able to
use a device that can help them look their best for important moments in life:
a milestone birthday, a wedding, or a chic New Year’s Eve party.  Companies are scrambling to meet this demand
with more and more devices, but not all devices are created equal.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Microcurrents</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Microcurrent
devices deliver extremely small electrical currents typically through the
surface of the skin.  Applications for
microcurrents have been broad ranging from treating general pain and diabetic
neuropathies, a specific type of pain associated with diabetes, to treating
muscle and ligament injuries to cosmetic skin treatments.  For cosmetic skin treatments, microcurrents
can be used to tone facial muscles and manipulate cellular changes within the
skin which result in significant improvements in facial contours and reduce
fine lines and wrinkles.  Cosmetic office
procedures have been used for decades, but in the past 5 years, interest and
use of home-use microcurrent devices have increased significantly.  </span></p>
<p><b><i>Consumer
Demands</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We interviewed
dozens of men and women and we received consistent feedback from them.  They wanted to know that their device was
working but experienced minimal immediate satisfaction from the currently
available devices.  In some cases, the
people interviewed weren’t even sure if their device was turned on!  The solution to this challenge is to improve
the overall experience of using a device by providing new product modalities
that provide immediate, readily detectable actions that improve both the use-experience
and the benefits of microcurrent treatment. 
To accomplish this, AMD has created a microcurrent device with added
massaging and heating actions to increase the amount of microcurrents being
delivered while creating a pleasurable experience for the user.  For users with more sensitive skin lower
microcurrent power settings will be available, and for users with less
sensitive skin, they will be able to increase the microcurrent power.  Again, our goal is to delight our customers
and give them the power of microcurrent therapy in a home use device with
additional massaging and heating action to provide both a powerful treatment
and a pleasurable experience.</span></p>
<p><b><i>SkinLumina
Product Concept</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
SkinLumina Facial-Toning Anti-Wrinkle Device is specifically designed for
home-use.  It is a microcurrent facial toning system intended to address the aging process by a number of means that we believe will include firming and tightening skin and facial muscles while at the same time reducing fine lines and wrinkles. 
The device is balanced and ergonomically designed, it has unique
electrode configuration, and provides triple-action including: advanced
microcurrent, vibration and heating. 
Both US Provisional and International patent applications have been
filed.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">AMD
has completed development of a functional SkinLumina prototype, and users love
it.  We now need your help to
integrate all components into a stand-alone, easy-to-use, home-use device.  We have the product concept and the know-how,
we simply need your help to realize our device and make available.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<h2><span>Why Indiegogo? 
What will the money be used for?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">To this point AMD has worked with its industrial designer and engineer to develop the best consumer-focused, fully functional prototype device with a novel combination of product features intended for in home anti-wrinkle therapy, and we feel we have succeeded.  However, the next step will
require completion of the development of the device that will be easy to use
and cost-effective to manufacture, reliable and of high quality to meet and
exceed all manufacturing and regulatory standards.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are
asking for your contributions so that we can complete development and begin
manufacturing the Skin Lumina device.  We
will work to keep manufacturing and assembly within the USA.  Based on our previous work with our
consultants and contractors, we can complete development in about 1 year and we
can get our device into your hands soon after that.  In fact, our backers will be the first people
to receive our device in time for their next big life events!</span></p>

I have a strong passion for distance running and enjoy soaking in the beautiful San Diego weather during my runs! I am fundraising money to help pay for my airfare and hotel expenses to compete at the New Balance Track and Field Outdoor Nationals. My dad will also be joining me on this trip.  I will be racing the Freshman Mile there and look to compete at a very high level. As a freshman, I've managed to maintain a 4.5 gpa and I am involved in leadership organizations, ASB, and clubs. I am a strong believer that hard work pays off and I am blessed to be in the position I am today. At the race, I will be racing the top freshmen all around the nation and this gives me the opportunity to run to my best potential! </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Thus far, this year has been very successful and everything seems to be working out well.</span></font><font size=""3"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> Helping me get to Nationals would be so amazing because this has been a huge goal of mine since the beginning of the season.  I have looked at the costs of the airline tickets to go to Greensboro, North Carolina on June 13-15, which is where the national meet is, and I was stunned to see how expensive they are! I am trying to raise 2000 dollars, which will pay for my airplane tickets, hotel costs and rental car costs!

I have a strong passion for distance running and enjoy soaking in the beautiful San Diego weather during my runs! I am fundraising money to help pay for my airfare and hotel expenses to compete at the New Balance Track and Field Outdoor Nationals. My dad will also be joining me on this trip.  I will be racing the Freshman Mile there and look to compete at a very high level. As a freshman, I've managed to maintain a 4.5 gpa and I am involved in leadership organizations, ASB, and clubs. I am a strong believer that hard work pays off and I am blessed to be in the position I am today. At the race, I will be racing the top freshmen all around the nation and this gives me the opportunity to run to my best potential! Thus far, this year has been very successful and everything seems to be working out well. Helping me get to Nationals would be so amazing because this has been a huge goal of mine since the beginning of the season.  I have looked at the costs of the airline tickets to go to Greensboro, North Carolina on June 13-15, which is where the national meet is, and I was stunned to see how expensive they are! I am trying to raise 2000 dollars, which will pay for my airplane tickets, hotel costs and rental car costs! If I do not reach my fundraising goal, I will use the money that I have raised to offset the costs of the trip.  If I exceed my fundraising goal, I will put the excess in an account that my family and I will use for upcoming race expenses. I am very excited to compete at this race and see how I do against the best freshmen boys in the nation! Here is a link to the New Balance Outdoor Track and Field Nationals official site so you can see what the schedule of events are and past results, and read more about the whole event, and even watch my race live: http://www.nationalscholastic.org/nbon

My goals for this event are to be in contention of winning and being recognized by college coaches.

<p>A most effective way to rehydrate with more electrolytes and more essential vitamins that tastes great without the sugar, calories or caffeine with a mission to assist people in developing countries in need of clean water and to protect against dehydration to save lives.</p>
<p>What if we were to tell you that you can now enjoy a good tasting sports drink that is more effective than other sports drinks but also contains no sugar, no calories and no caffeine while also helping those in need by providing clean water, safe sanitation, protection against dehydration and saving lives?</p>
<p>Well that's exactly what REHYDRADE is about: The most effective sports drink developed by lab scientists and a football coach, experts in their fields that empower you to create change in the world by helping increase clean water access, safe sanitation and protection against dehydration.</p>
<p>How: REHYDRADE is tied to raising funds for inspiring water and rehydration charities that are committed to bring fresh and clean water while protecting against dehydration to the millions still in need around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Become Rehydrated and help others become rehydrated!</strong></p>
<p>Rehydrade is a sports drink with much more than a materialistic value. You can now drink an effective sports drink and make a life saving difference in a developing country!</p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>REHYDRADE LLC is tied to raising funds for inspiring, impactful water charities that are committed to rehydration by bringing fresh and clean water and oral rehydration to the millions still in need around the world.</p>
<p>By purchasing REHYDRADE during the INDIEGOGO campaign, a charity will receive funds in order to bring fresh and clean water to someone in need. The more you purchase, the more you become part of the change. It's as simple as that!</p>
<p>Charities with which we will be making contributions to are; charity water, the water project, defeat diarrhea and dehydration and the rehydration project.</p>
<p>When you buy REHYDRADE, funds will be given to these associated charities so that they may provide oral rehydration salts (ORS) to protect against diarrheal dehydration, which can cause death; to fund plastic latrine pans and outlet pipes so that families in Central Africa can have safe sanitation for families and provide funding for clean water projects as well.</p>
<p><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong></p>
<p>In most rural communities, women and young girls are responsible for walking to collect water for their families. Many times this water is not clean water. Building a water project nearby can give women the freedom to pursue an education or earn extra income. Act now!</p>
<p><strong>Once Upon a Time………</strong></p>
<p>REHYDRADE’s founder, Coach Zack Gottfried worked hot summers in West Virginia while training top flight athletes that later played in the National Football League. He worked with these top flight athletes who were working out in the hot summer sun, sweating profusely and not getting properly rehydrated from sports drinks on the market. The sports drinks they were drinking acted in reverse. In essence they were packed with sugar and calories, thus ADDING unnecessary sugar and calories. Zack thought that there has to be a better way. Zack never liked carbonated beverages, any of them, so he would only drink non carbonated beverages. The problem was that almost all of them contained sugar and calories. HE was drinking these sugary drinks and knew it was not good for his long term health. So he sought out to find a healthier, more effective non carbonated sports drink to rehydrate everyday people in need; outdoor workers, college students dehydrated from late night alcohol consumption, outdoor law enforcement, military, athletes, coal miners, those suffering from flu like symptoms or diarrhea. Zack participated early on in life to “give back” to others less fortunate. He raised funds as a youth for charities he believed in and donated his time to the underprivileged. SO he decided that when he had something that he could develop he wanted to do it to help someone else less fortunate. The dream and vision is about to come true. With the birth of REHYDRADE others less fortunate can realize a benefit too.</p>
<p><strong>REHYDRADE is the answer</strong></p>
<p><strong>After seven years of research and development, REHYDRADE is the overwhelming choice of consumers tested based on its effect and its taste. Its formula has been designed by a football coach and lab scientists who are experts at rehydration. The facts are simple. REHYDRADE is an effective sports drink with more electrolytes and essential soluble vitamins than any of the major sports drinks in the US market. Its test groups have selected it over all competition when compared directly for effect and taste. </strong></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Chace was diagnosed with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukaemia), a rare and agressive form of leukemia, on the 14th of March 2011, just 3 days before his second birthday. This brave and strong little boy has begun an unplanned journey which we are all<span class=""text_exposed_show""> here to support and help along the way.</span><span class=""text_exposed_show""></span></p>
</div><p> </p><p>Last week the once energetic and outdoor-loving youngster was meant to be 
undergoing a stem cell transplant, because a bone marrow match could not be 
found, but a relapse of the cancer meant he was rushed back to hospital for a 
final, intensive round of chemotherapy. Doctors have told the family they will have the results within three 
weeks and if Chace's condition hasn't improved enough for him to receive the 
stem cell transplant, there will be nothing more they can do. </p><p> </p><p>The Topperwien's need at least $90,000 – and a miracle.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without money 
and a place on an international drug trial Chace's chances of survival are slim. 
Doctors say if the latest round of chemotherapy doesn't work, he will need 
palliative care. But we aren't prepared to give up the fight. Parents Ryan and Keri are desperately fundraising for an emergency dash overseas and frantically 
searching the medical world to get Chace on a drug trial targeting his type of 
cancer – and we've got just three weeks to find one.</p>

<p>My name is Leah, and I am one of Amy's sisters. I am putting together this fund to try to raise money for baby Easton's medical expenses.  As many of you already know my little sister and her husband welcomed baby Easton into the world on August 23rd. He is a beautiful ray of sunshine with gorgeous brown hair! We are all so excited to have him in our lives!<span> He is a tiny little man, with perfect hands, perfect baby feet and the most adorable ears! We will all be beyond estactic when he gets to go home so we can devour him up with love. </span>Unfortunately, my nephew was born 8 wks early weighing only 3lb 7oz. Because of this he is going to be in the NICU for many weeks to come and the expenses are going to start adding up quite quickly. </p>
<p>As you all know Amy and Brandon have always been so generous to all of us! I can't count the times that I've talked to Amy about a fundraiser she is participating in, a cancer walk she is doing, a shower, wedding or birthday party that she is planning for one of her friends or family members. She is a wonderful sister and my best friend!  And Brandon, the amount of times I've heard about him dropping whatever he is doing to help his friends and family. He has always been a wonderful husband, friend, brother, son... Their selflessness and generosity to us goes on and on.</p>
<p>My sister and her husband have been there for so many of us without blinking an eye. I hope that you are thinking the same as me and it is our turn to help them. Please take the time to contribute to Easton's healthcare expenses fund. All of the money we raise will go to taking care of their hospital bills and expenses. Everyone knows how expensive it is to be in the hospital for a short time... Being in the NICU for weeks is going to cost a small fortune even with their health insurance. The last thing I want them worrying about are the hospital bills. They need to spend these next weeks  and months taking care of their little man! </p>
<p>Please spread the word to your friends and family so they can help contribute as well! Feel free to contact me as well.</p>

I've played basketball and football for my high school which I have really enjoyed. When I was playing football I noticed some kids with cleats that were old and falling apart, some even being held together by duct tape! Noticing this really hit home for me because I was fortunate enough to know how good it feels to have nice new cleats. I wanted to do something to help them but at the time didn't know how. This need eventually pushed me to start this charity Sports Glory. After talking with local coaches and athletic directors at many different schools they have expressed that they have many students who are in need. I have contacted local stores and they have agreed to give me large discounts on buying these cleats because they know that they will be going for a good cause!</p>
<p>     Now I just need more funds to be able to supply cleats to these student athletes. Normally cleats can run upwards of 80 to 100 dollars and this can be a burden on some families. Getting these student athletes cleats to play their sport will enable the family to use money they would otherwise have spent on cleats for something else they need like groceries or school supplies. Being on a high school football team positively impacts many kids by giving them the incentive and support they need to perform well and stay in school. All donations are going to a great cause and are greatly appreciated! </p>

Touched by the loving environment that they encountered at UEFTE, and inspired by the sister’s mission to educate the children, Our Lady of Lourdes Academy and LaSalle High School were moved to offer assistance. In 1998, an organization called the Miracle of Mindo was formed to help raise funds to support the work of La Chia. Since that time, more than $500,000 has been sent to help support UEFTE . </span></p>

<p><span class=""Normal"">Cystic fibrosis is an inherited chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system of about 30,000 children and adults in the United States (70,000 worldwide). A defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick, sticky mucus that:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class=""Normal"">clogs the lungs and leads to life-threatening lung infections; and</span></li>
<li><span class=""Normal"">obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down and absorb food.</span></li>

<p class=""mvm uiP fsm"">The Mauli Ola Foundation began as a group of surfers who banded together to introduce surfing as a natural treatment to people with cystic fibrosis.

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system of about 30,000 children and adults in the United States (70,000 worldwide). A defective gene and its protein product cause the body to produce unusually thick, sticky mucus that:

clogs the lungs and leads to life-threatening lung infections; and
obstructs the pancreas and stops natural enzymes from helping the body break down and absorb food.

Mauli Ola Foundation

The Mauli Ola Foundation began as a group of surfers who banded together to introduce surfing as a natural treatment to people with cystic fibrosis. Since 2007, Mauli Ola has taken nearly 1,000 CF patients surfing at nearly 100 Surf Experience Days and has now expanded it’s reach with hospital visits and other activities that touch the lives of kids with cancer and a variety of other health challenges. In 2010, MOF was awarded The Agent of Change Award by SURFER Magazine for its positive contributions and example to the surfing community.
The Mauli Ola Foundation (MOF) was organized to promote education, awareness of genetic diseases and to increase research for genetic disorders. The MOF raises funds to support programs for kids and adults with life-threatening illnesses and disabilities through social events such as music concerts, sports tournaments, galas, and other great events. We want to provide a direct and immediate option for children with genetic disorders an enjoyable and healthy way of life through natural treatments. Mauli Ola means ""Breath of Life"" in Hawaiian.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm a long-time occupational therapist and run a statewide wheelchair seating clinic that evaluates, fits, repairs and otherwise help hundreds of Kansans who are wheelchair enabled ( <a href=""http://www.srs.ks.gov/agency/KNI/Pages/SeatingClinic.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.srs.ks.gov/agency/KNI/Pages/SeatingC...</a> ). I am also fortunate to work at a residential facility, Kansas Neurological Institute in Habilitation Services, which not only fits wheelchairs for folks with profound developmental disabilities, we also provide a wide range of other assistive technologies that we adapt or build from scratch for folks living here. I've been asked by Dale Huffman, a Certified Rehab Technology Specialist, as part of his VIM* work in Peru, to come to Lima with him and a team of others to spend 10 days at Centro Ann Sullivan del Peru (CASP) to help Peruvian children and adults with disabilities who need wheelchairs, modifications on existing chairs, and in the process, teach local folks how to do these things themselves. The last time Dale and his team went to Lima to provide services, they were met with long lines of families needing help as well as many health professionals who wanted to learn what we know about wheelchair assessment, modification and repair so that they could bring this knowledge to their communities. Dale has asked me to come along to help him meet the overwhelming need in a country full of folks willing to learn and help themselves if given the opportunity.<br/></p>
</div><div>

<li>Visit people in their homes and help them make modifications that give them greater access.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Each member of the team needs to raise all his/her travel costs; room, board and ground transportation costs along the way; and funds for tools and equipment to donate to the Centro Ann Sullivan. The $2,000 we're requesting would be used as follows:</p>
<ul>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It is immensely difficult to sum up someone's life in a few paragraphs - especially someone like my mom. Since she was born, I don't know that she has ever let anyone down. It is simply a quality that is innate within her. She has the ability to bring out the very best in people. And for the past 56 years, she has been bringing out the best in her students, players, fellow teachers and staff members, friends, and especially her family. Melinda Mitchell has taught everything from biology and drivers education to coaching the track team and the cheerleading squad. She is certainly a jack of all trades. She is an educator, a coach, a team player, a wonderful chef, a dear friend to many, an awesome wife, and an even better mom. She does so much for every person she interacts with. She gives you her full attention and her word is a guarantee. She will get the job done and go above and beyond your expectations. </span><br/></p>
<p><b>My mom was diagnosed with cancer in her liver and lungs in May of 2014 </b>and since that day, its been a constant battle. Melanoma cancer will claim the lives of an estimated 9,710 people this year. But I refuse to believe that Melinda Mitchell will be one of those lives. </p>
<p>In her first round of treatments, my mom was administered the drug <a href=""http://www.yervoy.com/patient.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yervoy</a> once every three weeks. She received three of these treatments and after further tests, her cancer was ultimately unaffected by the medicine and had only grown exponentially since her diagnosis. Her doctor has since moved her treatments to the University of Florida where she is receiving a breakthrough medicine called <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary?cdrid=695789"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pembrolizmab</a>. The cost of travel to Florida for treatments over the next two years including the cost of gas and the price of staying in a hotel for one night every three weeks will be over $8,000 dollars. Her treatments have racked up hospital bills upwards of $100,000 dollars and those numbers continue to climb. My family needs your help. </p>

<p>Cancer is an interesting word in our society. It's almost taboo to speak of it although it is becoming a fairly common disease to face in our lifetime. Many believe cancer doesn't have a face. But they would be wrong. Cancer has many faces across the world and one of them is Melinda Mitchell's. She doesn't have to be alone in her battle. We want as many people as possible to join this fight and raise awareness of this disease.  If this campaign is able to save the life of my mom while also saving the lives of others by raising awareness of the signs, symptoms, and prevention of Melanoma cancer, then this project has gone above and beyond its expectations. </p>
<p>We hope that you join our story and become a part of the fight against Melanoma cancer. Melinda Mitchell has made a difference in so many other's lives and now is your chance to make a difference in hers. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">But, we are hopeful that we can do even more! Maybe, through the love of so many, we can pay for one of my mom's treatments, or perhaps pay off some of her hospital bills that continue to accumulate as we fight this disease.

<p><b>Let your room take care of you</b></p>
<p>Juvo works with the latest smart home devices to optimize your sleep. Connect to your <b>LIFX smart lights</b>, and it'll adjust your bedroom lighting to help you achieve your sleep goals. Red light in the evenings allows melatonin to be produced, making it easier for you to fall and stay asleep. Blue light in the mornings, even as you sleep, blocks melatonin production, putting you into a lighter sleep so you wake up feeling great. Here are some other things Juvo can do:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off your TV using a WeMo switch so you will not be woken up in the middle of the night to terrifying images of The Walking Dead.</li>
<li>Talk to your Nest learning thermostat to make you snug in the night, while making sure you won't wake up to a cold bathroom floor in the morning.</li>
<li>Automatically silence your Android phone when you fall alseep, and re-activate it when you wake up.</li>

</h3> <p>We are The Boxing Gym West Seattle, a boxing school taught by a featherweight with a big heart named Coach Lee. A year ago we were all strangers to each other; now we're a boxing family. We are a true reflection of the diversity that surrounds us. Our gym provides a home for those who seek to discover themselves through the sweet science. Students come from all walks of life-from the street to the college educated. The school has become a pillar on which they can rely. Our goal is to continue to enrich our neighborhood by offering unique learning opportunities and warm, welcoming community. </p>
<p> A couple of months ago we were training outdoors with no equipment. With overwhelming support from the community, some perseverance in pursuing a dream, and a shoe string budget, we finally found our new home. We are just about all settled in and just need a few finishing touches to make our home complete, starting with the Ring! This would give us a safe and appropriate space for sparring and the ability to take our practice to the next level. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The Investment for the Ring is $3000. <br/></p>
<p>Our additional stretch goals in order to make our gym more complete are:</p>
<p> Bag Hangers to be hung on either side of the ring $1300</p>
<p>Kettlebells for rad new classes that compliment our current class offering $1200</p>
<p>Mats for flooring $450</p>
<p>Speed Bag $250</p>
<p>Campaign fees are dependent on the amount we are able to raise, so some of this money will go to cover that expense.</p>
<p>If we do not raise the full amount for all of our goals, the money that is contributed will go toward purchasing each item of equipment in the order that they are listed, starting with the Ring.</p>

Our goal is to continue to enrich our neighborhood by offering unique learning opportunities and warm, welcoming community. 
 A couple of months ago we were training outdoors with no equipment. With overwhelming support from the community, some perseverance in pursuing a dream, and a shoe string budget, we finally found our new home. We are just about all settled in and just need a few finishing touches to make our home complete, starting with the Ring! This would give us a safe and appropriate space for sparring and the ability to take our practice to the next level.    
What We Need & What You Get The Investment for the Ring is $3000. 
Our additional stretch goals in order to make our gym more complete are:
 Bag Hangers to be hung on either side of the ring $1300
Kettlebells for rad new classes that compliment our current class offering $1200
Mats for flooring $450
Speed Bag $250
Campaign fees are dependent on the amount we are able to raise, so some of this money will go to cover that expense.
If we do not raise the full amount for all of our goals, the money that is contributed will go toward purchasing each item of equipment in the order that they are listed, starting with the Ring.
Perks:
$10 A ""thank you"" on our website
$25 A sticker of our logo 
$50 T-shirt of limited printing designed for this campaign
$100 Zip-up hoodie of limited printing for this campaign
$250 A specially scheduled Boxing Bootcamp, plus the shoutout, sticker, campaign t-shirt and campaign zip-up. You get to choose from one of two Saturday mornings. You are also welcome to gift this class.   The Impact Your support helps us to continue to come together in a positive way-for our physical, mental and spiritual well being. It also helps a local, veteran owned business continue to offer a service about which all involved are very passionate. Many of our neighbors have already expressed that our presence is a much needed breath of fresh air. 

    Other Ways You Can Help We realize that some people may not be in a position to make a monetary contribution. Please consider sharing this campaign with others through email and/or your social media sites. Every little bit helps. Thank you!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Evelyn is the personal fresh air guide that measures the air quality in your immediate surroundings all in real-time. By communicating with your smart phone Evelyn can warn you if air quality is low, direct you to areas with safer air and provide an overview of the quality of air you breathed in on any given day. Air pollution is estimated to cause 7 million premature
deaths each year around the world. Among the 6 common air pollutants, NO2
and O3 are mainly created by vehicles. Individuals who spend time on
or near major roadways can experience short-term NO2 exposure
considerably higher than others. Scientific evidence links short-term NO2 exposure – 30 minutes to 24 hours – with adverse respiratory effects including increased
respiratory symptoms in people with asthma. Also, patients with pre-existing
respiratory diseases could be at increased risk of adverse effects to ozone
exposure.Every country has air pollution monitoring agencies that can alert you if there is a severe air pollution risk. However, it is impossible for these agencies to warn each individual of the risks in their surroundings. Evelyn is the personal fresh air guide that can warn YOU of YOUR immediate surroundings and guide you to safer and cleaner air.   










Each bit of data sent by a member of the Evelyn Community will be synced to the Evelyn Air Quality Data System in order to create a comprehensive database that tracks real-time air pollution conditions. Synced with Google maps, you can monitor what air conditions are like anywhere in the world. When we have acquired enough data, the data system will also be capable of predictive analysis for future air conditions. It is through your help that the Evelyn Air Quality Data System will meet its world changing potential!

Have you ever- Felt sleepless every night? Wasted lots of time and money on insomnia treatment? Needed to get rid of the radiation from electronic devices? Our original objective was to develop a product to help family members and friends who were suffering from sleep problems. During our research, we made the decision to design the iWhale to foster a more natural way to a better night's sleep. We believe health-beneficial products should be in harmony with nature. They should also be user-friendly, simple to use and affordable.As we know, a relaxing spa treatment promotes a good night’s sleep. Our research indicates that human’s olfactory sense can send a signal to the limbic system, which controls emotions and higher mental functions. Also, many studies show that lavender essential oil can influence the length of Alpha-wave activity (relaxation) in our brains, relaxing people rapidly. The theory perfectly matches our respect of nature. With excitement, the idea of iWhale was born.We hope iWhale can deliver a happy and natural life style. With the power of essential oil released, iWhale will improve your sleep, your quality of life and your future outlook. Sleep impacts almost everything in your life. iWhale is an ultrasonic essential oil diffuser that releases an aromatic mist into the air and optimizes air composition to help you fall asleep fast. It not only improves your sleep quality, but also helps to rejuvenate your skin and boost your immune system. Start your day off perfectly after a good night's sleep ... feel energetic and look your best. The application of 3Mhz™ gives birth to the most delicate and highly absorbent essential oil. When iWhale is working, the frequency of its ultrasound vibration is millions of times per second. iWhale atomizes the water and essential oil into extremely fine mist particles in nanometer, which is smaller than 1/10 of the diameter of the pores of human skin. In this way, the mist can reach to the base of your skin and makes you look younger and more energetic. Relax with soothing essential oil aromas iWhale performs best with essential oils. For purity and maximum healthful benefits, we recommend essential oils verified by the International Fragrance Association (IFA), Aromatherapy Trade Council (ATC), National Oilheat Research Alliance (NORA), the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH), or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A qualified oil clearly shows its ingredients, origin and Latin name of the plant, company or factory, series number and pureness. Recommended essential oils for sleep and relaxation include:BACKGROUND: Several aromatherapy studies are published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI):“Readily available aromatherapy treatments appear to be effective and promote sleep. ” － Hwang E1, Shin S.<The effects of aromatherapy on sleep improvement: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.>""According to the study results, it can be concluded that the lavender fragrance had a beneficial effect on insomnia and depression in female college students. ""－Taehan Kanho Hakhoe Chi.<Effects of lavender aromatherapy on insomnia and depression in women college students>.""Lavender essential oil increased quality of sleep and reduced level of anxiety in patients with coronary artery disease.""－Karadag E1, Samancioglu S2, Ozden D3, Bakir E4.<Effects of aromatherapy on sleep quality and anxiety of patients.>""After 12 weeks of lavender aromatherapy, midlife women with insomnia have shown improvement in the quality of their sleep.""－ Li-Wei Chien, Su Li Cheng and Chi Feng Liu<The Effect of Lavender Aromatherapy on Autonomic Nervous System in Midlife Women with Insomnia>iWhale is the most eco-friendly ultrasonic aroma essential oil diffuser with the first adoption of 4.5W/5V low energy-consumption design. It gets the most energy out of the essential oil with minimal energy consumption. One kWh of electricity can drive iWhale continuously for as long as 220 hours.

Enjoy fresher aroma, fresher air, and better sleep with iWhale!New Level-Up Capacitive Water Detection -- Improve water purity from the origin.   Electromagnetic radiation from household products can have a negative effect on our health, including our sleep patterns. iWhale's 4.5W/5V low-energy consumption design releases minimal electro-magnetic radiation, making it safe to use around children and pregnant women.
