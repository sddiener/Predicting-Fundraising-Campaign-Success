<h3>Hi There...</h3>
<p>    I'm Maggie Lawson, visual artist and chef. My work is about healing, ancestry, and intergeneration trauma and wisdom. </p>
<p>This project and residency are allowing me to live and work in one of my homes, Cincinnati, Ohio (after 15 years living on the left coast!). This work will happen in partnership with a community-focused art gallery (<a href=""http://www.wavepoolgallery.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wavepoolgallery.org</a>) and collaboration with my parents, both Cincinnati residents.</p>
<p>It will also give me the opportunity to address agism and explore within my family and the Camp Washington community what positive aging looks and feels like. Together, we will uncover the inner and outer structures that are obstacles to an old age of growth and play.</p>
<p>I am taking 6 weeks away from work as a chef and funding this project that address something that impacts EVERYONE. To do this I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>This is what I need to make a 6 week residency &amp; solo exhibition possible:</p>
<p><strong>Project Budget</strong></p>
<p>video production (gear &amp; labor): $1,000</p>
<p>birthday card production: $700</p>
<p>public events: $500</p>
<p>airline ticket: $350</p>
<p>installation production budget: $600</p>
<p>indie gogo fees: $300</p>
<p>TOTAL $3,450</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>6 weeks as the Wave Pool Gallery Artist in Residence April 15-June 1, 2019 and a solo exhibition that opens May 8, 2019.</p>
<p>The project will offer a wide range of audiences an opportunity to reflect on their relationship to aging and agism. </p>
<p>       IN THE GALLERY</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A collaboration with University of Cincinnati printmaking students to print 400 birthday cards that contain positive messages about aging</p></li>
<li><p> An interactive birthday scene with cakes sporting custom messages made in partnership with a local baker</p></li>
<li><p> A series of video portraits of older people who were nominated as examples of healthy aging</p></li>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is ambitious in scope - the funding I need to be able to take 6 weeks off of my day job and to produce this work is actually greater than the money I'll be raising with this campaign. In addition to the stipend from Wave Pool, I have other income generation in place to earn additional funds. </p>
<p>This project is worth it to me! Over the last ten years I have produced many socially engaged projects through the contributions (in labor and money) of my community. This is the first one I get to do in my home state. I also am grateful for the skills and knowledge I gained by completing my Masters in Fine Arts at UC Berkeley in May 2018.</p>
<p>If you have any additional resources outside of this fundraising effort that you think could help please send them my way. Usually what it takes to get the job done is a mysterious confluence of the planned and serendipitous!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if it is not be the right moment to contribute financially</p>
<ul>
<li>Help get the word out and make some noise about my campaign--post on social media, and personally email friends and family that might be interested in supporting this kind of work (Indiegogo has a unique set of SHARE tools you can use to easily share with others)</li>
<li>Volunteer to help out in the kitchen at one of the dinners or for the opening or closing of the show</li>

<h2><strong>The Book of Paintings</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Alexandrina Karadjova - Acrista, I am a full-time artist and I am blessed to do what I love. A couple of years ago, after a decade devoted to soft pastels, I set a new professional provocation in front of me: to master the oils. To celebrate the successful transition, I decided to produce a new art catalog with a selection of my recent oil paintings. Now I’d like to share it with you. Here are some of my thoughts on art that you will find in my new catalog:</p>
<p><i>“…I’m watching as a painting grows in front of my eyes and I feel I’m alive. That sense of creation, streaming under my fingers, is incomparable, just as is the beginning of life. I’m blessed beyond ordinary. Here, a new day in front of me: to give it value, to give it meaning, to feel the complete - that is the will of the heart. To paint the hours, spread under my palms like a white canvas, with all the hues of passion. To embed it with emotion from the deep my heart. To leave the trace of me. To give away to the world the treads of beauty that make me.”</i><br/><br/><i>“… leading in all of my paintings is the story it tells. No subject can recreate more beautifully the deep and moving emotion other than the female figure. And if one can feel the story it tells he will be connected with it and he won’t need to have “understanding of art” to live that inmost emotion.”</i><br/><br/><i>“… In the world and times we live in, beauty is going to become a commodity more and more valuable and sought after. Fed up with information, our senses will more often yearn for the simple, incipient, meaningful and valuable experiences of the heart.”</i></p>
<h2><strong>The goal</strong></h2>
<p>My goal is set at 4300 USD. This sum will be used for production of 500 hardcover copies of the book. The catalog will only be made in hardcover.<br/><br/>The catalog is laid out, edited and ready for press.<br/><br/>Any extra funding goes into creating dust jackets for the catalog and printing more copies.<br/>        <br/>If I reach my goal I expect to release the book and ship out the copies and all other perks (Giclee Prints, Vouchers, etc.) to Indiegogo backers before Christmas time.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I want to make sure you're able to get copies of <i>Marvel at the Mystery</i> as Christmas gifts for friends and family this year, so I'm using this indiegogo page as a pre-order/sale/fundraiser hybrid. The book is hardcover, 48 full-color pages, and retails at $15,00, but you can order a copy for only $10! Just click on one of the perks to order copies. </p>
<p>Although Wisdom for the Heart (my father's radio ministry) is buying many books for their ministry and helping me fund the cost of printing, I need to raise funds for a reprint of <i>The Big Cat Spat</i>. That fable is probably my favorite published book so far, but it has been on backorder for over three months now. If this campaign is successful, I'll be able to reorder copies in time for Christmas.  </p>
<p>Also, remember that fifteen percent of proceeds goes to Carol Adams in Uganda who is helping to equip and educate orphaned children touched by aids and war. I've been partnering with her now for two years and have been blessed to see all that God continues to accomplish through that ministry. </p>
<p>All in all, thank you for your interest in my poetry and art and I pray this new devotional book serves as a blessing to your entire family this year. </p>

<p><b>Update!</b></p>
<p>Some of the pictures and videos are now up on the carousel bar above! Thanks to your support, over $4000 of the $4000 - $4500 needed for TCP's  National Drive, and $500 of that needed for its companion Traveling Art Exhibit have been raised to date through Indiegogo, private checks, and online donations on our website! Please keep spreading the word and keep the donations coming, everyone! Thank You.</p>
<p><b>The National Drive: The Traveling Art Exhibit and Presentations.</b></p>
<p>The Custody Project assists qualified mothers who can no longer provide the common necessities of life for their families, due to the cost of defending the custody or visitation of their children. In need of competent guidance, affordable attorneys, and financial assistance, services to aid them are almost nonexistent. For this reason, The Custody Project's National Drive will run from San Francisco through Washington D.C., stopping in communities and cities along the route to give presentations, display a traveling art exhibit, and share a short documentary. The Drive will raise awareness of the plight of the families we serve, showcasing the hardships experienced by mothers and their children in the United States as a result of custody issues, inadequate child support, the complications of the family court system, or the inability to afford counsel. These hardships include homelessness, hunger, instability, poverty, domestic violence, abuse, devastating career restrictions, educational setbacks, and legal decisions which endanger and destabilize them. The art exhibit will include photos, quotes, and writings, and may include artwork created by affected families, such as paintings, drawings, and quilts - detailing their struggles in their own words: for example, a photo of the empty backpack of a child whose mother cannot afford to buy school supplies because she has not received any child support; or the empty pill bottle of a mother who forgoes medical treatment for herself in order to put food on the table for her infant. Towards the end of The Drive, part of the art collection donated may be sold to generate additional funding for our families and to support the next National Drive. By joining with us, you help strengthen a nationwide community to facilitate change for these silenced families.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546839989/aqk2dhzj6v0fdmsjlrl5.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <p><b>The Custody Project and Its Impact </b><br/> </p>
<p>In accordance with its mission, ""to promote the general welfare, both directly and indirectly, of mothers and their children as a unit as related to care, custody, and visitation issues,"" The Custody Project has been assisting those who suffer amongst us, unrecognized and unsupported, since 1994. TCP responds by helping qualified mothers with legal costs when they are defending the custody and visitation of their children, and by providing funds for common necessities when legal expenses prevent it and they are unable.<br/><br/>Our grant program, Heart to Heart, has been operational for over nineteen years. Our revolving-door loan program helps when, as mothers repay their loans, the funds can be redistributed to new families in need. TCP has also assisted in other ways including telephone support, brief lectures, information exchange, and meeting with mothers.<b> </b></p>
<p>By way of example, The Custody Project assisted a mother whose two young girls went on a routine, summer visitation block of several weeks to their father. During this time, he took the girls to England, as he had done in previous years. But when September and the time for their return to school in the United States arrived, the girls were not returned. The mother sought help from the courts, the district attorney, regular attorneys, the police, child protective services, and by frantically reaching out to whatever resources and agencies she could find. Told by attorneys that it would cost a minimum of<b> </b>$20,000 - $30,000 to reverse the kidnapping and effect the return of her children, in anguish she suffered, as she did not have the money. Eight months went by. One day, she found us and explained her situation. The Custody Project contacted an attorney familiar with international abduction who stated she need only fill out a one page form. The document was sent to us and forwarded to the mother. Great Britain took the case and the children were returned within a month, for free. The mother placed her testimony on our web site and it can be viewed in its entirety and in her own words under our Services tab (see, <a href=""http://thecustodyproject.org/tipsformoms.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thecustodyproject.org/tipsformoms.php</a> and <a href=""http://thecustodyproject.org/supportlinks.php%29."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thecustodyproject.org/supportlinks.php). </a></p>
<p>Please visit our website to read other anonymous Case Excerpts detailing how TCP has helped families through the years (<a href=""http://thecustodyproject.org/caseexcerpts.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thecustodyproject.org/caseexcerpts.php</a>).  </p>
<p>Such mothers face difficult financial challenges and may barter their homes, vehicles, assets, savings, retirement, and valuables - if they have them - to hire attorneys and meet the court costs required to protect their children. When you spread the word and help share their stories, you lift mothers and children facing family courts today whose costs can include:</p>
<p>Mediators:  $0 - $400 - $700+ per report</p>
<p>Evaluators:  $1500 - $5000+</p>
<p>Expert Witnesses:  $50 - $500+ per hour</p>
<p>Attorneys:  $25 - $300+ per hour</p>
<p>Attorney Retainers:  $500 - 5,000+</p>
<p>Attorney Hours Required:  10 - 100 - 1000 - 10,000+</p>
<p>Other Fees $$$:  Court Filing Fees, Service of Process Fees, Deposition Fees, Transcription Fees, Visitation Fees, Investigative Fees, Paralegal Fees, Expert Consultation Fees, and More...</p>
<p>Crippling court costs demand mothers forego their mortgage or rent, their car payments, and  heating/electric/water/sewage/telephone/grocery bills. Having used funds for common necessities to pay the uncommon costs of law, they face economic disaster. Court hearings demand these mothers take time off from work and, unlike employers who understand and can provide flexible scheduling, unsupportive employers let them go. Some lose their homes, their cars, all of their savings, and still, it is not enough to cover the ongoing costs of court: the crises these mothers face to protect their children are all encompassing and devastating.  When you donate, you are making it possible for a family to have heat in the winter, to keep the homes they live in, to drive the cars they've got, to hire the attorneys needed, to cover court costs without risk to their jobs - and these are great gifts to our families. You keep them stable and secure and you protect children in great need of your help.</p>

<br/><b>What We Need</b>

<br/><b>Risks and Challenges </b>
</div><div>As the funding for The National Drive is almost fully secured, we are launching Phase II to raise the amount needed for the visuals for The Traveling Art Exhibit and Presentations. This step includes obtaining the materials to create the pictures, photographs, and remaining artwork to be displayed.

Once the artwork is created, a portable, collapsible, lightweight presentation assembly will be designed to highlight it. As sufficient funding comes along, work on the documentary will begin.

<br/><b>About Donna</b><br/><br/>The need for support for mothers and children affected by custody and visitation issues has been evident to Ms. Signorelli, founder of The Custody Project, since 1990. Representation by competent, compassionate attorneys familiar with the unique circumstances these families must be excised from is crucial, and it is financial support which secures representation when affordable options are otherwise unavailable to them. Such vital assistance means the difference between 18 years lived in peace and productivity versus years marred by danger, legal entanglements, and catastrophic educational, familial, and financial losses. In a nation of families where all lives matter, it is the difference between a family resting calm or floundering in chaos, between security or poverty, between going forward or going bankrupt, between life or losing their children to kidnapping, domestic violence, and death.</div><div><p>Thankfully, a loyal group has given their financial backing for years to forward her concern and help affected families through The Custody Project and, for these mothers and children a donor's compassion is their lifeline. But a broader effort for such families is needed. Envisioning periodic nationwide drives to raise awareness for their plight since 1992, she made her first national drive during the summer of 2008, personally paying the Drive's cost along with two friends. Now, she plans to Drive again and, to create a visual showcase to uplift these families, your help is needed. You can deliver hope, strengthen the hands of a concerned nationwide community, and build upon the nationwide call to action now needed for our mothers and children by giving voice to compassion.

Some of the pictures and videos are now up on the carousel bar above! Thanks to your support, over $4000 of the $4000 - $4500 needed for TCP's  National Drive, and $500 of that needed for its companion Traveling Art Exhibit have been raised to date through Indiegogo, private checks, and online donations on our website! Please keep spreading the word and keep the donations coming, everyone! Thank You.
The National Drive: The Traveling Art Exhibit and Presentations.
The Custody Project assists qualified mothers who can no longer provide the common necessities of life for their families, due to the cost of defending the custody or visitation of their children. In need of competent guidance, affordable attorneys, and financial assistance, services to aid them are almost nonexistent. For this reason, The Custody Project's National Drive will run from San Francisco through Washington D.C., stopping in communities and cities along the route to give presentations, display a traveling art exhibit, and share a short documentary. The Drive will raise awareness of the plight of the families we serve, showcasing the hardships experienced by mothers and their children in the United States as a result of custody issues, inadequate child support, the complications of the family court system, or the inability to afford counsel. These hardships include homelessness, hunger, instability, poverty, domestic violence, abuse, devastating career restrictions, educational setbacks, and legal decisions which endanger and destabilize them. The art exhibit will include photos, quotes, and writings, and may include artwork created by affected families, such as paintings, drawings, and quilts - detailing their struggles in their own words: for example, a photo of the empty backpack of a child whose mother cannot afford to buy school supplies because she has not received any child support; or the empty pill bottle of a mother who forgoes medical treatment for herself in order to put food on the table for her infant. Towards the end of The Drive, part of the art collection donated may be sold to generate additional funding for our families and to support the next National Drive. By joining with us, you help strengthen a nationwide community to facilitate change for these silenced families.
 The Custody Project and Its Impact  
In accordance with its mission, ""to promote the general welfare, both directly and indirectly, of mothers and their children as a unit as related to care, custody, and visitation issues,"" The Custody Project has been assisting those who suffer amongst us, unrecognized and unsupported, since 1994. TCP responds by helping qualified mothers with legal costs when they are defending the custody and visitation of their children, and by providing funds for common necessities when legal expenses prevent it and they are unable.Our grant program, Heart to Heart, has been operational for over nineteen years. Our revolving-door loan program helps when, as mothers repay their loans, the funds can be redistributed to new families in need. TCP has also assisted in other ways including telephone support, brief lectures, information exchange, and meeting with mothers. 
By way of example, The Custody Project assisted a mother whose two young girls went on a routine, summer visitation block of several weeks to their father. During this time, he took the girls to England, as he had done in previous years. But when September and the time for their return to school in the United States arrived, the girls were not returned. The mother sought help from the courts, the district attorney, regular attorneys, the police, child protective services, and by frantically reaching out to whatever resources and agencies she could find. Told by attorneys that it would cost a minimum of $20,000 - $30,000 to reverse the kidnapping and effect the return of her children, in anguish she suffered, as she did not have the money. Eight months went by. One day, she found us and explained her situation. The Custody Project contacted an attorney familiar with international abduction who stated she need only fill out a one page form. The document was sent to us and forwarded to the mother. Great Britain took the case and the children were returned within a month, for free. The mother placed her testimony on our web site and it can be viewed in its entirety and in her own words under our Services tab (see, http://thecustodyproject.org/tipsformoms.php and http://thecustodyproject.org/supportlinks.php). 
Please visit our website to read other anonymous Case Excerpts detailing how TCP has helped families through the years (http://thecustodyproject.org/caseexcerpts.php).  
Such mothers face difficult financial challenges and may barter their homes, vehicles, assets, savings, retirement, and valuables - if they have them - to hire attorneys and meet the court costs required to protect their children. When you spread the word and help share their stories, you lift mothers and children facing family courts today whose costs can include:
Mediators:  $0 - $400 - $700+ per report
Evaluators:  $1500 - $5000+
Expert Witnesses:  $50 - $500+ per hour
Attorneys:  $25 - $300+ per hour
Attorney Retainers:  $500 - 5,000+
Attorney Hours Required:  10 - 100 - 1000 - 10,000+
Other Fees $$$:  Court Filing Fees, Service of Process Fees, Deposition Fees, Transcription Fees, Visitation Fees, Investigative Fees, Paralegal Fees, Expert Consultation Fees, and More...
Crippling court costs demand mothers forego their mortgage or rent, their car payments, and  heating/electric/water/sewage/telephone/grocery bills. Having used funds for common necessities to pay the uncommon costs of law, they face economic disaster. Court hearings demand these mothers take time off from work and, unlike employers who understand and can provide flexible scheduling, unsupportive employers let them go. Some lose their homes, their cars, all of their savings, and still, it is not enough to cover the ongoing costs of court: the crises these mothers face to protect their children are all encompassing and devastating.  When you donate, you are making it possible for a family to have heat in the winter, to keep the homes they live in, to drive the cars they've got, to hire the attorneys needed, to cover court costs without risk to their jobs - and these are great gifts to our families. You keep them stable and secure and you protect children in great need of your help.

</div></div>","Hello! I am Anna Horvath, graduate designer at CSM, London. My travelling project got accepted to the Games for Change Festival in New York and we would like to take it to Art Cologne 2015 too. The aim is to collect £6000 , which would allow us to take the installation to at least the first 2 locations. If we can raise more than that, we will expand the locations of the tour, and  thus the opportunities to participate!                                   What is 'Art tag'?'Art Tag, materialising values' is a critique on the valuation of contemporary art in the form of a game-based art installation.                                 Who can play?
ANYBODY CAN PARTICIPATE! It is a role-playing, strategy game where you have to be an artist!The game can be played with your own art work or with art pieces from well-know artists. 
     What is the aim of the game?
You just have to act as an artist and persuade the participants of the art world to buy your art.  Simple. However, for this you need to take some necessary steps, such as education, exhibition, media coverage, etc. while maintaining your living. Not that easy, right?
Where is it going to be played?The game takes place at art fairs and across unique locations of the contemporary art world. 



What is the outcome?
A fun entertainment where you don't know who is involved in the game and who isn't! At the end, an art installation will express the quantity
 of  the winners and the losers. There won't be any differences between 
their artworks, however it will show how the circumstances - like 
financial background, social networks and institutions - influence the 
artist's carrier in today's prestige-based society. 
So, you will create the results of this game in the form of a thought-provoking installation.Who are we?A team of young creatives working on the fields of art and design internationally. The project directed by Anna Horvath who is graduating at MA Narrative Environments from Central Saint Martins, University of Arts, London. What is the return of your support?We will return your generosity with Art tag products, like badges, postcards, bags and toolkits. We will indicate your names on our installations around the world and your gallery, magazine or art piece can be part of the video game!What is the aim of the game?The game stands on 2 levels. Firstly it aims to be a teaching device for young artists by showing how the market works, and it offers alternatives in their career rise... Secondly, it is a critical commentary on the manipulative and elitist character of the art market, and it aims to highlight the artist's position in the recession in terms of funds, tuition fees and housing in cultural hubs.If you also think that contemporary art valuation is an unpredictible labirynth...
If you wish to raise awareness in this topic...

<div>
<p><b>WROUGHT </b>is a Sheffield-based performance festival with an exclusive focus on one-to-one performance (i.e. a unique one performer, one audience dynamic) and intimate audience experience, brought together by co-producers, Erin Revell and Moe Shoji. </p>
<p>We launched WROUGHT: A One-to-One Performance Festival in October 2014 in response to the lack of a live art and fringe performance scene in Sheffield, and a passion for one-to-one performance. Over two days, WROUGHT 2014 showcased the work of 19 artists and 1 documenter-in-residence. It allowed both established and local, emerging artists to bring their unique practice to the audiences of Sheffield. And, thanks to all the support from the artists, volunteers and audience members, the inaugural festival was a huge success. </p>
<p>It was the first festival of its kind in Sheffield, and the first venture of its size for us. As festival producers, we learned so much: we learned that there is an audience for one-to-one in Sheffield, we learned that this type of performance can be thrilling and moving and potentially life-changing, and we learned enough to know that if we were to do it again, it could be even better. And so this year, we are determined to produce WROUGHT 2015, but we need your support.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Last year, we were generously supported by Arts Council England and Masie Glass Fund of the University of Sheffield. This year again, we are applying for a funding from Arts Council England, but we need to raise 10% of the total amount we are asking for before the application is made. We have money from last year's ticket sales, some support from the University, and as co-producers, we are investing £200 respectively, but we still fall £550 short of what we are aiming for. We would like to ask for your support to make it possible for us to apply for ACE funding and to deliver WROUGHT 2015 in October 2015.</p>
<p>The minimum pledge starts from £10 - please consider this as pre-booking your ticket for this year's festival. The festival ticket will cost £10 (the same as last year) and you will get an audience experience for 3 performance pieces with 1 ticket. <b>All investors will get early access to the tickets</b> and with an event that is likely to sell out fast, this is a great opportunity. </p>
<p>Any money you donate for us will be a part of 10% we require for ACE funding application and it will be used for either:</p> <ul> <li>Documentation. We are planning to have 2 documenters in different media, to document the festival in a creative manner. The final product will be available for you to access.</li> <li>Supporting volunteers' work.

<p>Here is the key information for WROUGHT 2015:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dates: 9th - 11th October 2015</li>
<li>Venue: the Hide (S3 1AA) </li>
<li>Artists: 22 artists + 2 documenters</li>
<li>Free Events: Launch party (Fri 9th Oct), Festival evening party with DJ (Sat 10th Oct), Post-festival Discussion (Sun 11th Oct), Reflective Panel Discussion (on w/c 19th Oct, tbc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful features that are staying the same: WROUGHT will continue to use the Hide as its main hub. However, the performances will spill out across the city of Sheffield -- in the streets, shop-fronts and supermarkets. The line-up is based on the strong network of artists we have built. We will continue to have an open-call for emerging artists based in and around Sheffield in the spirit of supporting the developing local talent.</p>
<p>There are some new developments as well: This year, we have Soraya Nabipour (Sad Siren Theatre) to support the co-producers as an assistant producer.

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Your support is very valuable and it will enable us to apply for ACE funding scheme.

I have never left my passion for combining my art and political topics. I am a versatile artist, whether collaborating with visual artists, composers, musicians, performance artists or dancers. I have accomplished a rich and diverse performance network including: MPA-B,  APAB and most recently have performed at Die Akademie der Kunste, Hebbel-am-Ufer and won the jury prize for 100 grad festival 2015. - </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">For more about me check out my website: </span><a href=""http://www.katieleedunbar.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.katieleedunbar.de</a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/common-to-usa/katieleedunbar.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></a><div>
<br/><div>
<p>This campaign is about gaining the funds to be able to bring COMMON to another continent, LA - USA. COMMON is a performance series inspired by first-hand experience. It is at the same time an autobiographical reflection and a social political research. I started collecting material from the unemployment situation in the ex-coal mining region of the Northeast of England where my family comes from and I ended up dealing with the issues of post-industrial societies. What I show is a personal story, yet it is universally, common. In this solo performance series I use text, sound, coal, bike-wheels, film and dance to piece together the end of my father's life and the economical and political system around it.</p>
<p>My aim is to draw a link between all the post-industrial communities around the world, by pointing to a pattern of lack of value of the human life that was invested in our different mining/industrial areas around the world. Communities that powered centuries of industrial development are often left to rot after the land and the people are used up. My plan is to draw these links by creating a web of exchange, starting in LA, USA. </p>

<div>Check out the Perks you get! They are all designed so that you can see the work you are supporting me producing while I am in LA. For the first 10 people who donate - I will personally call to thank you. For 30 Euros or more you will get a live stream performance while I am in LA. Donations over 100 Euro you will get a free pass for my performances in 2016. And donating between 10 and 30 euro means you will get a selection of photographs of the work I am producing while in LA.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have already saved around 1500 EUR of my own money and have applied for various travel and research grants in Berlin and the UK.  Some I didn't get, some I am still waiting to hear from. For me to be able to accept the residency in December, I need the money quicker than any government funding could get it to me. But, I will not let money get in the way of me being able to make smart professional and creative moves. Originally I was invited to take part in the three months residency at <a href=""http://www.eastsideinternational.com/air%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eastside International</a> and I have already cut that down to one month so that I am sure I can find sufficient funds. I am practical and have spent my life working hard and making a little money go a long way. Therefore whatever amount of money I get, even if it's below the amount I am asking for I will make it work - that's a tried and tested fact. And if the unbelievable happens and I get more money that I am asking for - you can be sure that it will go into the continuation of COMMON - and drawing the map of post industrial communities, next on my map will be the UK. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have any spare cash - I get it, trust me - Help me out by sending this campaign to friends and family that might be interested in donating. Or simply share it on any of your social networks.  If I get 110 people who donate 30 EUR then I will have met my goal and will be able to continue working on COMMON and will be able to bring it to the US. Together I think we know 110 people with 30 EUR to support me and my art, right? Back me, write lovely comments or do any other supporting thing you can think of! </p>

</div></div>","COMMON to LA 
I was born as a direct result of the miners’ strikes in the 1980s in the north of England. I studied at University of Falmouth (B.A. Honours) and at Esalen Institute Big Sur, California. I have travelled considerably and for the past five years my base has been Berlin. I have never left my passion for combining my art and political topics. I am a versatile artist, whether collaborating with visual artists, composers, musicians, performance artists or dancers. I have accomplished a rich and diverse performance network including: MPA-B,  APAB and most recently have performed at Die Akademie der Kunste, Hebbel-am-Ufer and won the jury prize for 100 grad festival 2015. - For more about me check out my website: www.katieleedunbar.de

This campaign is about gaining the funds to be able to bring COMMON to another continent, LA - USA. COMMON is a performance series inspired by first-hand experience. It is at the same time an autobiographical reflection and a social political research. I started collecting material from the unemployment situation in the ex-coal mining region of the Northeast of England where my family comes from and I ended up dealing with the issues of post-industrial societies. What I show is a personal story, yet it is universally, common. In this solo performance series I use text, sound, coal, bike-wheels, film and dance to piece together the end of my father's life and the economical and political system around it.
My aim is to draw a link between all the post-industrial communities around the world, by pointing to a pattern of lack of value of the human life that was invested in our different mining/industrial areas around the world. Communities that powered centuries of industrial development are often left to rot after the land and the people are used up. My plan is to draw these links by creating a web of exchange, starting in LA, USA. 
Eastside International has invited me to bring COMMON to LA and take part in their residency program. This is the perfect opportunity to start drawing my map of disparity - LA has a huge gap between rich and poor. The city has a long standing history in the performing Arts. LA is a great place for me to show my work and make connections with performance Artists, making these contacts will strengthen my career.  Most of all, I will be able to expand my audience and more people will be able to hear this very important largely untold story.

<p>Augmented
Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are growing fast with demand from various
industries sectors like education, professional trainings, marketing and many
more. Individually, both already played crucial roles in changing the future of
human interactions with information’s using the latest’s technology and
gadgets. However, combining both will revolutionize the way we look at how 3D
registered graphics combined and interact in the real world. Reviewing the

<p><strong>Hey art lovers of all varieties,</strong><br/><br/>Thank you for stopping by and supporting the arts, and our team! As artists, we often work on commissioned projects and rarely have the time, or resources, to create our passion projects. <br/><br/>We are a three person team of body painters and acrobats, collaborating to create living art and bring some joy, beauty, and wonder into this world we all live in. This summer, we are headed to the World Bodypainting Festival again! Let me introduce the team and tell you about our project.<br/><br/>The amazing body painter on our team is Moona Weaner (Hyun Yong Jin). Moona, born in South Korea, now from Los Angeles, started her art journey with sculpting as a young adult. In college she enrolled in a beauty art institute and fell in love with drawing, body painting, and makeup. Since 2010 she has participated in numerous international body painting competitions and has won 5 championships. She is also a sought after educator at many global universities and academies. You can see her work in various prints, ads, and broadcastings around the world.<br/><br/>Tony Schott, one of our amazing acrobats, from Atlanta, GA started his training in gymnastics at a young age. This led to many state and national titles in both gymnastics and competitive cheerleading, both as the athlete and a coach. His professional focus switched to circus arts 7 years ago and he now showcases his creative athleticism, and fabricating expertise, with his co-owned, performance design company, The Off Centered Project.<br/><br/>And hi, I am Kristina Guede, the other half of the acrobatic duo, co-owner, creative director of TheOCP. I have been a dancer since I can remember, finding a focus in classical ballet. That is what led me to Atlanta from Illinois. I have been a freelance artist for 15 years in various roles from runway modeling, ballet, circus variety acts, costume design, body paint modeling and so much more. Life is never dull, and that's how I like it.<br/><br/>Together, our team has won two, 1st Place titles, and one, 2nd Place title at Living Art America, a North American Bodypaint Championship (1st) and IMATS Atlanta (1st &amp; 2nd). We have collaborated on SPFX makeup demos for beauty schools in South Korea, created live visual sensations for audiences unplugging from technology, and have stayed up countless nights working on handmade prosthetics/costuming for various competitions. But most importantly we have created a worldwide friendship through art that creates positive conversation and bewilders the mind.<br/><br/>The end result is always magical but the work put in is not for the faint of heart. Plasters, silicones, latex, clay, paints, and so much more is needed to create the appliances we need for this masterpiece. Hours are spent life casting, sculpting, pouring moulds, creating bald caps, practicing the paint on the body, not to mention traveling with this stuff (watching us get on a plane is often hysterical). The whole process is a science really. Not to mention the hours of training in the gym with our acrobatic coaches we do to keep our bodies in tune and bringing the art to life in the most unique ways we possibly can.<br/><br/>This summer, our team is reuniting to compete at the World Bodypainting Festival in Klagenfurt, Austria!!! We are taking on the Team category, where the paint and the presentation are to be judged as one, SPFX Makeup, AND the SPFX Bodypainting categories. The themes are fun and out of this world. We can't wait to show you what is brewing.<br/><br/>This is why we need your help!<br/><br/>Our plane tickets and apartment are covered but we could use your support to help offset cost of materials, mentioned above, and, if anything is left over, to help fill the fridge while we are there.</p>
<p>Why do we do these projects/competitions? Well, simply put, to gain recognition. Unfortunately we live in a who's who world and titles help us to get the bigger and better jobs to be able to support our platforms and continue to be thriving artists. Not only do the body paint artists benefit, we as models have a chance to win model awards, plus our team category being a collective assessment helps us all, if we win of course. All we can do is our best, but your support helps take the stress off of the financials of the project and allows us to focus on the art.<br/><br/>Your support means the world to us. We can't do this without the people who support us. We look forward to sharing our artistic journey with you. <br/><br/>xoxo,<br/>Kristina, Moona, &amp; Tony</p>
</div></div>","Hey art lovers of all varieties,Thank you for stopping by and supporting the arts, and our team! As artists, we often work on commissioned projects and rarely have the time, or resources, to create our passion projects. We are a three person team of body painters and acrobats, collaborating to create living art and bring some joy, beauty, and wonder into this world we all live in. This summer, we are headed to the World Bodypainting Festival again! Let me introduce the team and tell you about our project.The amazing body painter on our team is Moona Weaner (Hyun Yong Jin). Moona, born in South Korea, now from Los Angeles, started her art journey with sculpting as a young adult. In college she enrolled in a beauty art institute and fell in love with drawing, body painting, and makeup. Since 2010 she has participated in numerous international body painting competitions and has won 5 championships. She is also a sought after educator at many global universities and academies. You can see her work in various prints, ads, and broadcastings around the world.Tony Schott, one of our amazing acrobats, from Atlanta, GA started his training in gymnastics at a young age. This led to many state and national titles in both gymnastics and competitive cheerleading, both as the athlete and a coach. His professional focus switched to circus arts 7 years ago and he now showcases his creative athleticism, and fabricating expertise, with his co-owned, performance design company, The Off Centered Project.And hi, I am Kristina Guede, the other half of the acrobatic duo, co-owner, creative director of TheOCP. I have been a dancer since I can remember, finding a focus in classical ballet. That is what led me to Atlanta from Illinois. I have been a freelance artist for 15 years in various roles from runway modeling, ballet, circus variety acts, costume design, body paint modeling and so much more.

<p>I am a student a the University of Arizona in Tucson. For my senior capstone project, I am creating a field guide to share my love for the Sonoran Desert. This is a book illustrated, designed, and written by me. It's very easy to read, there are 50+ large, color illustrations of plants, animals, and fungi, some are desert icons and some you didn't even know existed! It's small, so it's perfect to carry on a hike. I have poured my heart into every aspect of this book and I would love for it to actually get printed!</p>
<p>So printing is a funny thing, for one of these 150-page books to get printed it's about $200 (in nice paper and perfect bound stitching) but for 25 books each one breaks down to about $22. I can't quite afford to print just one, so why not print a bunch and spread the love?  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need at least 10 people to buy a book at 40 dollars each in order to make printing this worthwhile. If 10 people contribute $40 each one will get a book mailed (or delivered if you're nearby) along with a personalized note of thank you. </p>
<p>If more than 10 people buy a book, thus making the cost of each book go down, you'll get a book, a handwritten note of thanks, and some stickers of the plants and animals you see in the book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You can use this book to learn about the world, encourage you to go outside, teach your kids about animals or simply look at the pretty pictures!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book is ready to print already, so it's up to your donation to make it a reality.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! This book is great for anyone young or old, experienced hiker or city dweller. </p>

<p>Hello world,</p>
<p>We are Rossen and Nenko. We're from Bulgaria, the two and only members of ""Badge"". From one year ago, we have been living in the poorest Roma ghetto on the Balkans. it's called ""Sunrise"" or in Bulgarian ""Izgrev"", popularly known as ""Stolipininovo"". ""Sunrise"" for over 20 years has been depicted as the worst and most morally degraded living district in Bulgaria, where things such as prostitution, drug-dealing, murder and rape are nothing unordinary. Our goal is to coach some local kids. We record, together with a few local youngsters with GoPro cameras, everyday situations in the ghetto. The manufactured videos we upload to our youtube channelhttps://<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuaSW33X9IO-D_-7UQcTcJA/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube.com/channel/UCuaSW33X9IO-D_-7UQcTcJ...</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>During this process, the Roma youngsters are taught how to film, how to edit, how to work with sound, how to use social media and without being too intrusive, teach them history of cinema and afterwards we will let them carry on the same challenge we've taken upon with them, finding new students of their own. The letter..maybe is too long or maybe too short..but from previous bad experiences with so-called ""big"" instiutions - the conflict is that their accent has always been on the differences. How a group of people want to adapt or readjust the others around them according to their values. We want to put an accent on the ""sameness"" so that we wouldn't be bothered by our differences. We invite you to follow the fruits of our adventures on our YouTube channel.</p>

<p><u><strong>SHORT SUMMARY</strong></u></p>
<p>We are a group of students currently in our 3<sup>rd</sup> year of the BA(Architecture) in the Department of Architecture at the National University of Singapore (NUS). We’ve been given the to opportunity to realise a hypothetical light installation after submitting the proposal for the I Light Student Award over the July 2018 Summer break. We are seeking your help to help fund this 6 months-in-the-making project that will be displayed at the annual I Light Singapore: Bicentennial Edition at the Marina Bay. Your support will help cover additional construction and material costs, as well as general administrative tasks such as setting up of the installation before the start of the lights festival.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>OUR TEAM</u></strong></p>
<p>Designers: Bryan Joseph Cadag_ Loo Quan Le_ Zulkarnain Mohd Zin</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>THE DESIGN</u></strong></p>
<p><i>_Why the Singapore Stone?_</i></p>
<p>Seeing how we’ve all at one stage of our local education here in Singapore have been made aware of the story of Badang and the Singapore Stone as a part of the local folklore stories- with Singapore serving as the geographical context- we decided to use this as a starting off point after deliberating what the theme of I Light 2019, Bicentennial Edition- <i>Bridges </i><i>of Time-</i> means to us. We wanted a subject matter that was familiar, yet not fully understood by Singaporeans. Those stories were always told light-heartedly, with the pretence to take it with a pinch of salt, since it lacked physical evidence (aside from the Sejarah Melayu). However, the Singapore Stone was a tangible vestige of the past; it is one of the 12 ‘preserved’ National Treasures that precedes the 1819 founding date, yet not fully due to historical circumstances</p>
<p>*refer to the excerpt <i>Design Excerpt </i>for the stone’s timeline</p>
<p><i>_The Installation_</i></p>
<p>The installation is the interpretation of the various states of the Singapore Stone’s existence; it is an interpretation of what was, what it is, and what it could have been (if it was not destroyed). 52 pedestals of various heights are scattered within an approximately 8m by 5m area, with 51 ‘rock fragments’ being placed a top each pedestal. 1 pedestal is left intentionally empty, as a sort of ‘reservation’ and hinting to the only piece of the Singapore Stone that we still have, currently being kept in the National Museum of Singapore. From the front of the installation, the varying heights of the ‘rock fragments’ will lend to the visual recreation of our assumption of what the original Singapore Stone could have looked like before its destruction. However, as the gaze of the viewer shifts as he circumscribes the installation, it slowly disintegrates and shifts into it’s a sort of time- warped, “exploded” form, referencing to its destruction in 1843. To further emphasize on the state of explosion, the fragments will light up in an orchestrated fashion, so that it radiates from the “empty pedestal”, slowly cascading to the rest of the installation, like a pulse. This will help animate the explosive nature of the installation</p>
<p>The pedestals are made of mild steel, while the ‘rock fragments’ are recreated out of perforated wiremesh, folded and warped to recreate an ephemeral take on a generic rock form. This material choice would allow for the ‘rock fragments’ to be illuminated internally.</p>
<p>*Do read the excerpt <i>Design Concept </i>portion of our proposal for further explanation on the thought process, with relevant renders and diagrams. Be mindful that certain physical aspects of the installation have changed such as scale and dimensions due to site restriction, though intent and concept and general form have remained unaffected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET </u></strong></p>
<p>After receiving the design budget from the festival organisers and sponsorships, we are still short of $10 000 USD of the estimated construction fees. The additional fund will be used to cover the equipment that we were not able to retrieve from the sponsorship, as well as to cover hidden costs such as initial storage, transport, setting up, tearing down and administrative tasks. <strong>This is where your support comes in!</strong></p>
<p>For every donation tier reached (Silver, Gold, Platinum and Premium), the names of the sponsors will be etched and placed prominently as the 1<sup>st</sup> floor tile of the platform holding the installation; you will be a part of physical manifestation of the installation!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>THE IMPACT </u></strong></p>

We are a group of students currently in our 3rd year of the BA(Architecture) in the Department of Architecture at the National University of Singapore (NUS). We’ve been given the to opportunity to realise a hypothetical light installation after submitting the proposal for the I Light Student Award over the July 2018 Summer break. We are seeking your help to help fund this 6 months-in-the-making project that will be displayed at the annual I Light Singapore: Bicentennial Edition at the Marina Bay. Your support will help cover additional construction and material costs, as well as general administrative tasks such as setting up of the installation before the start of the lights festival.
 
OUR TEAM
Designers: Bryan Joseph Cadag_ Loo Quan Le_ Zulkarnain Mohd Zin
 
THE DESIGN
_Why the Singapore Stone?_
Seeing how we’ve all at one stage of our local education here in Singapore have been made aware of the story of Badang and the Singapore Stone as a part of the local folklore stories- with Singapore serving as the geographical context- we decided to use this as a starting off point after deliberating what the theme of I Light 2019, Bicentennial Edition- Bridges of Time- means to us. We wanted a subject matter that was familiar, yet not fully understood by Singaporeans. Those stories were always told light-heartedly, with the pretence to take it with a pinch of salt, since it lacked physical evidence (aside from the Sejarah Melayu). However, the Singapore Stone was a tangible vestige of the past; it is one of the 12 ‘preserved’ National Treasures that precedes the 1819 founding date, yet not fully due to historical circumstances
*refer to the excerpt Design Excerpt for the stone’s timeline
_The Installation_
The installation is the interpretation of the various states of the Singapore Stone’s existence; it is an interpretation of what was, what it is, and what it could have been (if it was not destroyed). 52 pedestals of various heights are scattered within an approximately 8m by 5m area, with 51 ‘rock fragments’ being placed a top each pedestal. 1 pedestal is left intentionally empty, as a sort of ‘reservation’ and hinting to the only piece of the Singapore Stone that we still have, currently being kept in the National Museum of Singapore. From the front of the installation, the varying heights of the ‘rock fragments’ will lend to the visual recreation of our assumption of what the original Singapore Stone could have looked like before its destruction. However, as the gaze of the viewer shifts as he circumscribes the installation, it slowly disintegrates and shifts into it’s a sort of time- warped, “exploded” form, referencing to its destruction in 1843. To further emphasize on the state of explosion, the fragments will light up in an orchestrated fashion, so that it radiates from the “empty pedestal”, slowly cascading to the rest of the installation, like a pulse. This will help animate the explosive nature of the installation
The pedestals are made of mild steel, while the ‘rock fragments’ are recreated out of perforated wiremesh, folded and warped to recreate an ephemeral take on a generic rock form. This material choice would allow for the ‘rock fragments’ to be illuminated internally.
*Do read the excerpt Design Concept portion of our proposal for further explanation on the thought process, with relevant renders and diagrams. Be mindful that certain physical aspects of the installation have changed such as scale and dimensions due to site restriction, though intent and concept and general form have remained unaffected.
 
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET 
After receiving the design budget from the festival organisers and sponsorships, we are still short of $10 000 USD of the estimated construction fees. The additional fund will be used to cover the equipment that we were not able to retrieve from the sponsorship, as well as to cover hidden costs such as initial storage, transport, setting up, tearing down and administrative tasks. This is where your support comes in!
For every donation tier reached (Silver, Gold, Platinum and Premium), the names of the sponsors will be etched and placed prominently as the 1st floor tile of the platform holding the installation; you will be a part of physical manifestation of the installation!
 
THE IMPACT 
The installation aims to raise awareness of Singapore’s 700 years of history and before. Singapore’s earliest historical event tends to be essentialised and relegated to Sir Stamford Raffles’ arrival in 1819. However,  Malay folklores such as Sang Nila Utama and Badang serve as glimpses to an earlier past, though lacking in tangible evidences.  We want to shed light and give exposure to a national treasure that has played ‘carafe’ in many historical events and texts; to an object that connects a past before Singapore's modern founding to the present, where it currently resides in the National Museum. It places Singapore in a bigger geographical picture, and not just materialised and made significant in 1819. It also aims to incite interest within Singaporeans to explore on their own country’s past that is not common knowledge or readily accessible.
Any donation or sponsorship, regardless of amount, will go a long way in helping fund this project. For us, to see a summer side project turn to an actual realised installation on such a significant event is a humbling experience and truly exciting as we near the set-up dates. We sincerely invite you to be a part of this project by extending a hand to fulfil the vision we have imagined!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Fortunately, we have a space and already own some of the major equipment needed for our studio, including a kiln and two wheels. Here are the essentials for setting up a successful and productive studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insulation for the garage door and roof of the studio</li>
<li>A heater to keep the studio warm and toasty</li>
<li>A shed to store extra equipment, tools, and materials</li>
<li>Electrician to hook up the kiln properly</li>
<li>Kiln venting system</li>
<li>Kiln furniture, etc. (shelves, posts, cones, stilts)</li>
<li>Heavy duty tables</li>
<li>Glaze materials</li>
</ul>
<p>If we're able to meet our goal of $6000, we are more than happy to give back a little something to those who donated to our campaign. Think of it as a donation with a prize attached! Check out the incentives on the right-hand margin.</p>
<p>If we are able to surpass our goal, we will be able to purchase extra equipment, such as ware carts, photo/lighting equipment, and a hot box, among various other things.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As emerging artists, it is crucial to have a space to make our work. Without the essential items above, we would have no way of firing our work to the finished state. Renting a studio can cost anywhere from $150 (a low estimate) to $400 per month for ceramic artists in the Boston area. We would rather save our money and pour it into cultivating a space to grow on our own terms. A ceramics studio is a place for us to make our work, but it's also a venue to teach and immerse others in the creative process. We plan to host events, hold private one-on-one classes, and build with our local community of Everett, MA.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest risks we face is not gathering enough funding. If the campaign does not raise $6000, then it will take us a lot longer to build our studio.

<p>Since we own and are not renting the space, the risks associated with funding our campaign are pretty minimal. Once the kiln and ventilation are hooked up and the insulation is in place, the only things left to do are buy the rest of the necessary equipment and get the space ""studio ready,"" which will include cleaning, rearranging, and painting. Other than that, we're good to go!</p>

<h3><strong>FAQs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>What is a kiln?</strong></p>
<p>Like a super hot oven, we use kilns to fire our work. Without this piece of equipment, our ceramics could never be used because any water added would cause them to disintegrate. Typically, there are two firings within the process, the bisque and the glaze firing. A bisque expels the mechanical/chemical water within the piece and makes it porous/less brittle. After applying glaze, the final firing vitrifies the clay (making it non-porous and able to hold water) and creates that glassy surface!</p>
<p><strong>Why ""Dirty E"" Studios?</strong></p>
<p>""Dirty E"" is a nickname for Everett, MA. We like it because ""dirty"" has a double meaning--both for the name of the town and the messy making process. We tend to get more than a little dirty when we work...</p>
<p><strong>When will I receive my perk?</strong></p>
<p>You will receive your gift in March of 2018. We need enough time to set up the studio and settle in before we start making your pieces! Please note that the colors and style of the pieces will vary. Each piece is unique!</p>

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>I'm a paper sculptor/illustrator, and I'm looking to raise $5500 to help me work on putting together a children's book illustration portfolio. My goal is to have a minimum of twelve new, portfolio-worthy paper sculptures completed by January 2013*.</p>
<p>*Looks like it might be closer to mid-February, updates on progress to come soon! (edited 11/29/2012)</p>
<p>In 2006, I quit my office job to focus on my paper sculpting.  Since then, I've sold art online. The online market quickly shifted the direction of my work away from portfolio-type pieces - since I am usually working to cover bills and rent and such, I've been unable to focus on making larger, more detailed works that would take a long time to find a buyer.</p>
<p>Recently, I was lucky enough to be offered representation by a great literary agent, <a href=""http://www.andreabrownlit.com/deals_sonnack.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kelly Sonnack</a> at the <a href=""http://www.andreabrownlit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrea Brown Literary Agency</a>. So now, all that's holding me back is not having the perfect portfolio. With your help, that last obstacle can finally be overcome!</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>My goal is to end up with a great portfolio to show to children's book publishers. Right now, because of of the direction online selling has moved my work, I mostly have small sculptures with a single character and little to no background/environment. I need to create detailed pieces with expressive characters interacting believably with each other and their environments. I also want to have some examples of the same character(s) doing different things to show my ability to keep a character looking the same throughout an entire series of illustrations.</p>
<p>Some of the things you'll see in the finished portfolio are: expressive characters with detailed costumes, children interacting with colorful creatures, antrhopomorhic animal characters, fantasy castles and dragons and more (and cats, of course)!</p>
<p>I'll post regular updates with pictures to show the progress of the portfolio.</p>
<h3>The Long Version</h3>
<p>When I was 5 or 6, I got a copy of ""Tales of Magic and Make Believe"", a wonderfully illustrated book of short fantasy tales.  From that day, I knew I wanted to illustrate children's books (though at the time I think I just thought of them as ""books"").</p>
<p>During my final year at RIT (where I earned my BFA in Illustration in 2002), I was introduced to paper sculpture around the middle of the year. It quickly became my favorite medium/technique.  Since it came so late in my college career, I didn't graduate with the portfolio I wanted to show to publishers, as I didn't have but a few paper sculptures.</p>
<p>My plan was to put together a portfolio and then work on getting some book deals, but things didn't work out exactly as planned. For a few years I worked an office job and didn't have much time to work on paper sculptures. </p>
<p>In 2006, I quit that job to focus on my paper sculpting.  Since then, I've sold art online. The online market quickly shifted the direction of my work away from portfolio-type pieces - since I am usually working to cover rent and bills and such, I'm unable to focus on making larger, more detailed works that would take a long time to find a buyer.</p>
<p>Recently, I was lucky enough to be offered representation by a great literary agent, <a href=""http://www.andreabrownlit.com/deals_sonnack.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kelly Sonnack</a> at the <a href=""http://www.andreabrownlit.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrea Brown Literary Agency</a>. So now, all that's holding me back is not having the perfect portfolio!</p>

The Plan
My goal is to end up with a great portfolio to show to children's book publishers. Right now, because of of the direction online selling has moved my work, I mostly have small sculptures with a single character and little to no background/environment. I need to create detailed pieces with expressive characters interacting believably with each other and their environments. I also want to have some examples of the same character(s) doing different things to show my ability to keep a character looking the same throughout an entire series of illustrations.
Some of the things you'll see in the finished portfolio are: expressive characters with detailed costumes, children interacting with colorful creatures, antrhopomorhic animal characters, fantasy castles and dragons and more (and cats, of course)!
I'll post regular updates with pictures to show the progress of the portfolio.
The Long Version
When I was 5 or 6, I got a copy of ""Tales of Magic and Make Believe"", a wonderfully illustrated book of short fantasy tales.  From that day, I knew I wanted to illustrate children's books (though at the time I think I just thought of them as ""books"").
During my final year at RIT (where I earned my BFA in Illustration in 2002), I was introduced to paper sculpture around the middle of the year. It quickly became my favorite medium/technique.  Since it came so late in my college career, I didn't graduate with the portfolio I wanted to show to publishers, as I didn't have but a few paper sculptures.
My plan was to put together a portfolio and then work on getting some book deals, but things didn't work out exactly as planned. For a few years I worked an office job and didn't have much time to work on paper sculptures. 
In 2006, I quit that job to focus on my paper sculpting.  Since then, I've sold art online. The online market quickly shifted the direction of my work away from portfolio-type pieces - since I am usually working to cover rent and bills and such, I'm unable to focus on making larger, more detailed works that would take a long time to find a buyer.
Recently, I was lucky enough to be offered representation by a great literary agent, Kelly Sonnack at the Andrea Brown Literary Agency. So now, all that's holding me back is not having the perfect portfolio!

I’ve been teaching it in Tokyo, where I’ve lived for 14 years. I love it here. My students, the Japanese, the food; love it. <br/>But I don’t just teach capoeira. I spread Afro-Brazilian and Latin culture and dance through presentations (I received a Masters in Brazilian culture from Waseda University, Tokyo) and via collaborations with Brazilian artists living in Japan. <br/>Last year, my family, friends and students took part in the Asakusa Samba Carnival, Tokyo, one of the largest events of its kind in the world – 500,000 people attended! Trust me when I say, the Japanese just love Brazilian culture. <br/><br/><strong>So what’s the challenge?</strong><br/>Japan is great. But they do things a little bit differently over here. Take non-profit organizations　(NPOs); they hardly exist here. If they do, they don’t get a lot of help from the state (no tax breaks or grants) and ordinary people don’t really think about them too much either. <br/>But I ran my Capoeira Zoador Academy (Zoador) as an NPO. Through Zoador, I teach, I visit elementary schools and present classes on Afro-Brazilian music, dance and culture.<br/>Since the economic downturn of the last few years and the 3/11, 2011 Earthquake in Japan, however, NPOs like mine have had a rough time of it. Student numbers are down and cultural events are fewer.<br/>But I live in the Land of the Rising Sun, as Japan is called. And I live by my own motto: live, love, play capoeira! So hope is back in 2013, and Zoador is here to let it breath once again in Japan. <br/><br/><strong>Here’s the Plan.</strong><br/>The 1st Brazilian Culture &amp; Arts Congress (September 14th to 15th 2013).<br/>Basically, we will invite 12 passionate Brazilian artists, including capoeira masters and dance legends, to Yokohama, a beautiful port city and one of the most international places in Japan, right next to Tokyo.<br/><br/>We’re already 50% into the planning: our guests have been contacted and they have agreed to come, some of them even offering to reduce their usual fees for us. A 1,800 person venue has been kindly donated to us – the Yokohama Country and Athletics Club (It’s amazing how asking politely can produce results).<br/><br/><strong>What you can expect to see at the event?</strong><br/>There’s a whole schedule of amazing events we have planned. This is a very short list. Apart from capoeira workshops (of course) by leading mestres (master), we will have: <br/><br/>Carnival style samba dance, samba de Roda, Afro Brazilian Dance, Bossa Nova, and other forms of Brazilian Culture, Guitar, choro, Orchestra of Brazilian Music and creativity, Samba Show techniques, Guitar, Drums and Afro-Brazilian Rhythms, Vocals, Samba dance, Orixás dance, Percussion from Bahia, Cavaquinho, flute and saxophone…</p>

For that, we are trying to fundraise: US$17,200 include Indigogo fees<br/><br/><strong>Let me break it down</strong><br/>Cost to get them here and daily expenses. Remember this is really cheap for<br/>Japan (Tokyo-Yokohama Area).<br/>Costs to Hotel, food, and get them around my wonderful city for 5 nights.<br/>Business hotel (Cheap) ¥7,000 a night, back and forth from the airport, meals,<br/>to event and back = ¥47,310 about US$512. per person. So multiplied by 12<br/>artists US$6,144 for everybody. Flights are the other stickler, about ¥935,000 for<br/>all of them! About US$10,136 to get them here and back to their loved ones....<br/>Total: ¥1,502,720 or US$16,280 plus fees equals US$17,200.00<br/><br/>With your kind donation, however large or small, I’m sure we can reach our target.<br/><br/>Whether or not you contribute financially, we would really appreciate your help in spreading the word about our indiegogo campaign.

<div>The only problem is I don't have enough money to pay for the plane ticket and hotel costs. So I've decided to try out an <strong><em>IndieGoGo</em></strong><em> </em>campaign to try and raise the money.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need:</h3>
I'll need roughly $1000 to pay for these things:</div>
<div>   ○ Roundtrip plane ticket from Atlanta, GA to Baltimore, MD</div>
<div>   ○ Hotel costs for three nights</div>
<div>   ○ Food for three days of being at the convention</div>
<div>   ○ Free shirt buttons to pass out to bronies</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get:</h3>
Aside from being able to see me at the convention, you'll have a chance to claim these rewards when you donate:</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• $5 - Printable thank you card emailed to you (signed by FlamingoRich)</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• $25 - The above rewards, plus access to <strong>exclusive artwork and material</strong> related to FlamingoRich's <strong>next production</strong>
</div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• $50 - The above rewards, plus an <strong>exclusive Double Rainboom T-Shirt</strong> and access to <strong>recorded workshops on animation</strong> normally only accessible by FlamingoRich's crew. (These workshops cover things like storyboarding, backgrounds, vector art, character design, and more.)<strong><br/></strong>• $200 - <strong>ULTIMATE BRONY PACKAGE: </strong>The above rewards, plus access to all <strong>305 shots</strong> of <em>Double Rainboom</em> in the form of <strong>.FLA &amp; .AE files</strong>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
The Brony fandom is a fantastic and exhilarating thing, where the impossible can become possible. I created <em>Double Rainboom</em> in order to prove that when we band together, we can surpass society's limitations and create the same kind of entertainment that brought us all together in the first place! I'm hoping that by appearing at Bronycon and talking about my experiences, I can help inspire the community to aim ever higher and achieve greater and more marvelous works of art.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute any money to this campaign but still wish to help out, then you can do one (or all) of the following:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">○ Tell your friends! Link this campaign on your twitters, your tumblrs, and your facebooks.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">○ Use IndieGoGo's share tools to help spread the word!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">○ Email EqD at <a href=""mailto:submit@equestriadaily.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">submit@equestriadaily.com </a>and tell them about this! If we can get this campaign on their front page then it'll bring in tens of thousands of viewers.</p>
</div></div>","Howdy Everypony!
My name is Zachary Rich, but you might all know me better by my online persona: FlamingoRich. I'm the writer & director of Double Rainboom, a fanmade episode of My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic. The episode was released on March 30th of this year, and so far has gathered nearly 4 million views on YouTube!
 
In case you haven't seen it yet, you can check it out up above - or through visiting the film's official website at http://www.doublerainboom.com

 
Anyways, I've been invited to host a screening and Q&A panel on the film at Bronycon 2013 - taking place in Baltimore, Maryland from August 2nd to 4th. To learn more about the convention, head on over to their main site at http://www.bronycon.org/

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Troy and I am a digital and traditional artist and photographer.<br/>I spend most of my time working on all sorts of art using a variety of programs but this is partially because I can't get a regular job.</p>
<p>I have a number of disorders and illnesses, the prominent one being a biorythm disorder that does not allow a regular job because I sleep on different times every day and trying to fight it causes migraines, fevers and a ton of stress.</p>
<p>The only means of generating an income I have is my art, but, my laptop is as close to it's end as it can be. It's old and worn-down, it is in fact broken in half and only barely working, held together by tape.</p>
<p>This is where I'll need your help, my laptop struggles with even the simplest programs at this point and makes art impossible to make. You'll help me get a solid new laptop ready for the work I wish to deliver my commissioners and fans. It really will give me not only hope for the future, but you'll give me an actual future to continue to work up into.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I will need is a (more than) decent laptop that can handle any and every program I need. This includes things like Photoshop, rendering software, 3D modeling software and video editing.</p>
<p>What will you get? Well apart from a truly sincere thank you I can hand you my art and give you special rights to existing art, or, for the bigger donators I will personalize my art just for you and finally for the top perks I can make art just for you from scratch! There will be a variety of art types so I can hopefully return the favor of donating to everyone. Patience may be required considering my laptop's state, but I hope it'll manage alright until I reach my goal.</p>
<p><em>*I will use your funding name and post an image unless you contact me with the name you'd like me to use.</em></p>
<p>Each and every penny will go towards the laptop and resources I need for my art. This is not a campaign to help me, it is a campaign to help me help myself. You will give me the oppertunity to improve and hopefully fix my life and allow me to give something back to the world in the form of art.</p>
<p>Even if the goal is not reached every euro will be used for a new laptop should I find one that fits my needs and if not than it will be put aside until I have enough to purchase it. So even if the goal is not reached, the money's purpose will remain the same until it can be used for it's goal.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is somewhat of a desperate last shot at trying to get a new laptop, I don't personally enjoy taking donations but this way I can still give something back. You will help me truly change my life and give me an honest shot at trying to live a normal life despite a bunch of problems hindering that.</p>
<p>Since making art is my current only means to generate income it is important that I continue to be able to create it. I'm not the best artist, but I will never be able to live up to my potential if I can't continue to create and improve the art I could never live without.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute there is a number of ways you can still help me.<br/>You can check out and share my art and let others know about my campaign.<br/>I would be happy if even ONE more person knows and enjoys my art so even if you can't contribute in the form of money, I will always want people to share and enjoy my art, even giving you opinion on it or points to improve will help me as an artist.</p>
<p>So if you can't contribute, share! It'll help me out a lot.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone in advance and for taking the time to read all the way down to the end.</p>

inspirational person, Mrs. Godwin. Mrs. Godwin taught speech and theater, and
she said I had talent. I had never been good at anything, in fact one year; I
revived the ""most improved"" award in three separate activities.  But when I started performing, writing, and
creating, I felt unstoppable. All the things wrong with my life disappeared if
only for a short while. Mrs. Godwin told me I could do anything, and I believed
her. As it happens, I went to college, let life get in the way, and forgot all
about creating, and the fact that ""I could do anything"".  Then I had my daughter Bella. She woke me up,
made me use my imagination, and create once more. The Imagineerium is my dream,
it is a place where children can come and create anything their little minds
can dream up. It's also a place where adults can come to reclaim their
creativity, and to remember what it is like to use their imaginations. With the
help of this campaign, we hope to have a permanent home for The Imagineerium.
We will offer imaginative programs, in which we will bring in experts on
various mediums to help teach art forms of all kinds, including;</b></p>
<p><b>* </b><b>Girls
nights out</b><b>:
where women of all ages can come, paint, craft, write, or whatever creative
experience strikes their fancy. </b></p>
<p><b>*</b><b>Date
nights</b><b>:
where couples can come get to know one another, and learn how each one creates,
and just have fun, whether it be having a paint fight, working together to
create a cooperative project. </b></p>
<p><b>*</b><b>Family
nights/days:</b><b>
where families can come work together to create projects for their homes, or
just have fun painting, creating, or learning more about each's creative
process. </b></p>
<p><b>*</b><b>Children’s
workshops: </b><b>This
is where kids from the ages of 2-10 can come and create projects using various
mediums. </b></p>
<p><b>*</b><b>Children
/ Adult Birthday Parties: </b><b>These
are customizable events that will run the gambit of creativity. Everything from
a Classy painting event to a wild paint throwing, food fighting free for all;
and that’s just the adult parties. </b></p>
<p><b>  The Imagineerium is a dream, and right
now it’s in need of a home. With your help, we would like to find a home, a
space for people to gather and create. The funds gathered from this campaign
will go towards costs of renting a space for 6 months to a year (depending on
costs). If more funds are raised that we need for a space, they will be put
towards payment of talented local artists who will be helping with our

place any funds received into a high interest savings account until our goal is

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Friendly Falcons and Their Friend the Snake is the collaboration 
of artists Jeffrey Kurosaki and Tara Pelletier. Inspired by what they 
deem as life’s magnificent and miniature grandeurs, they create 
multi-layered narratives with sculpture, drawing, music and performance.
 Their work is like riding a wave of primary colors and absurdity with 
an undercurrent of melancholy and whimsy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In November 2010, The Friendly Falcons will be undertaking a [five]-country tour, performing their “nomadic artwork,” The Cactus Duet. They will visit Denmark, Germany, France, The Netherlands, and England. The project is a theatrical set that fits into a suitcase and will be put together onsite to tell a story with music and kinetic sculpture.  The conceptual underpinnings, design, and form of the work will reflect contemplations on nomadism and wandering.  It is an exercise in engineering and editing, as we will bring only what we can carry and use found objects alongside intuitive building techniques to customize each show based on the site and resources.  Through song and performance a story will emerge using brief moments and disparate events. It is a fracturing of the linear tale, wherein the parts accumulate one by one to create an overall sense and environment rather than a concrete narrative. The music in the show is written as our musical duo, The Hawk is a Lonely Hunter.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Concurrently, we are leading a workshop at Funen Academy of Fine Arts in Odense, Denmark, called Nomad as Art.  In the workshop, students will be asked to make a formal or functional artwork that explores the history and ideology of nomadism. We will bookend our tour with our workshop in Denmark, so that we will meet with students before we perform and then after all of our traveling and performances. We love that we will be doing what we are teaching and aim to ""report back"" to the students, and speak of our own experiences on the road. It would be wonderful to have footage of the different environments and contexts that we experience to share.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also plan to undertake a US tour, through this project we will learn valuable tools and lessons for planning that tour. It will also enable us to promote that tour through documentation of our past experience.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Three quarters of this money will go to a video camera and a tripod to document our tour. We would like to record every show we do, so that we can come back and share it with our community and plan our next tour (see above). With the remaining quarter of the money, we will purchase public transportation tickets, cab rides to and from airports (we are carrying a big suitcase), and electrical conversion devices for each country. We are offering different perks to those that can offer donations. Our own handmade soap and postcards from the road. Also, we are working with a friend, Laura Fisk, to make screen-printed posters. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are booking venues in all of those countries until the last moment- we are 
hoping to perform as many times and at as many different types of venues
 as possible. We are open to music spaces, galleries, people's homes, 
bars, seaside docks, hot air balloons, and inside various large animal's
 stomachs. If you know of something, please get in touch!<br/></p>

<p><b>""Find your voice,""</b> they tell me. What they're not
prepared to hear is that I <i>have </i>found
my voice. It's just covered in blood and broken teeth.</p>
<p>My life had a bleak outlook from the beginning. Endless piles
of garbage. Old food encrusted on plates, harboring colonies of flies.
Cockroaches. More cockroaches. Suicide. Heroin overdoses. Incest. More suicide.
Just to scratch the surface.</p>
<p>I've told these stories to friends, psychiatrists, and
suicide prevention people, and their response is the same.</p>
<p>""You should write a book.""</p>
<p>Therein lies the objective of this campaign. <i>Psychoanalysis (Session 1)</i>, an image
compilation book, was my first literary ""self-help"" experiment. The
project turned out beautifully, but having to personally fund its publication, production
output was minimal and expensive. My next volume, <i>Psychoanalysis, Session 2</i>, will expand my autobiographical
endeavors in the same vein as its predecessor. This time around, however, I am
furthering the scope of the project. That is where I need your help.</p>
<p>The campaign goal is $1000. I will continue printing copies
of my first and second volumes whether that figure is met or not, but in the
event of the former, production will be much less expensive and the outreach
will be magnified.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this isn't an aim for personal
profit, but a chance to channel anguish into raw creation, catharsis, and
healing, and for others to identify with those same experiences. If you or
someone you know has battled the throes of depression or self-harm, you know
how imperative it is to find your voice--however seemingly tarnished--and to <i>just create.</i> </p>
<p>In support of this notion, a $10 donation will enable me to
send you a <i>Psychoanalysis </i>volume of
your choosing. A $20 donation allows me to send you both. Of course, every
contribution, great and small, is highly appreciated. Understandably, a passionate
person may be tight on funds. If a donation just isn't feasible right now, you
can still be a tremendous help to this project by using the Indiegogo share
tools.</p>
<p>However sizeable this campaign's success, there will be more
projects to come. There will be a <i>Confessions</i>
book, which can be summed up by all those times you think to yourself,
""(*INSERT EXPLATIVE*), did I <i>really </i>just

wherein there will be a variety of campaigns to fund projects like the <i>Psychoanalysis</i> books, and much more. I

My name is Louis Dodd and I'm a composer and artist from the UK.

</div><div>I wanted to do something a bit different and interesting, so I made the portraits on Photoshop and they are made entirely out of triangles. Each triangle was individually drawn and coloured, and each portrait took around 2-3 days to complete.</div><div>

</div><div>
<span>The professional advantages of studying at this school are tremendous, with many of its students going on to win Oscars, BAFTAs and work on some of the biggest blockbusters out there!

Being able to attend this school would be life changing, however without the funds to get started this may not be possible. </span>
<br/>
<br/>
</div><div><h3>So, what exactly would I be using your money for?</h3></div>
<br/>
<div>Well, as I said above I'm looking to use the money from this campaign to fund a couple of months of rent and bills when I move from Liverpool to Beaconsfield in January 2015. I have been looking at property renting prices for several weeks now, and £500 per month is pretty much standard (which is almost double what I paid for my last flat) so already this is a big financial blow!</div><div>After looking at my past financial outgoings, I figured that I can probably cover utility bills and food for about £250 per month, which is cutting it pretty fine, but is more than manageable (4 years of being a student teaches you how to be poor :P).</div><div>The third and final financial problem is that almost every property that I have looked at is unfurnished, meaning I'm going to have to buy a bed, a desk and chair, some kitchen utensils etc. This is likely to come to almost £500 after actually getting all of my stuff to Beaconsfield.</div><div>So just to break that down for anyone who fell asleep whilst reading (I need to stop ranting!)</div><div style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px;"">
<b>Rent</b> - £500 per month</div><div>
<span style=""font-size: 15.5555562973022px; background-color: initial;""><b>B</b></span><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""><b>ills/Food</b> - £250 per month</span><br/>
</div><div>
<b>Furniture</b> - £500</div><div>
<b>Total of first two months</b> - £2000</div><div>
<br/>
<h3>Enough of the boring stuff, what do YOU get?</h3>
<br/>
<div>Well, I have created quite a large variety of perks which I am hoping you will like! All 4 portrait designs are available on T-shirts, Hoodies, Sweatshirts and even as prints in 3 different sizes! <b>Perks are offered</b> for contributions of £5 and upwards, however anything donated is greatly appreciated :).</div>
<div>I have tried to keep the prices as reasonable as possible, taking into account the cost of buying merchandise, printing and postage. Remember these designs are completely unique and cannot be purchased anywhere else. Treat yourself or someone you know to an early Christmas present - you know you deserve it! </div>
<br/>
<div>
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<br/>
<div>To be completely honest, none! If you like the designs and would like to have it as a print or to wear, then you'll be getting a quality product and donating to what I think is a very good and honest cause. All money raised is reserved purely to pay for amenities, not for personal enjoyment, and I thank anyone who is kind enough to help out in anyway that they can!</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h3>Can't contribute?</h3>
<br/>
<div>That's fine! I'm grateful that you looked at my page and if you would like to help, but can't donate, then sharing this page would help me massively. The more people who see it, the better!</div>

<div>So, that's basically it! If you have read this far, thank you so much for taking the time out to do so, and to any one who donates or shares the page a massive thank you and I hope you like your rewards!</div>

Welcome to my Indiegogo Page!
My name is Louis Dodd and I'm a composer and artist from the UK. Since 2011 I have worked on over 40 short films, episodes and games for companies such as the BBC, as well as companies based in the UK, USA, Bermuda, Bulgaria, Serbia and Istanbul. I have set up this campaign to help me fund my time studying Composition for Film and Television at the National FIlm and Television School. As I have always loved art, I decided to make some designs which would be printed and sold as posters, T-Shirts, Hoodies and Sweatshirts. The designs available are of Walter White (Breaking Bad), Dexter, Nucky Thompson (Boardwalk Empire) and Daenerys Targaryen (Game of Thrones). 
I wanted to do something a bit different and interesting, so I made the portraits on Photoshop and they are made entirely out of triangles. Each triangle was individually drawn and coloured, and each portrait took around 2-3 days to complete.

Recently, after over 6 months of interviews and applications, I was accepted into the prestigious National Film and Television School based in Beaconsfield. This was recently voted the World's best Film School, and as you can imagine is an absolutely incredible opportunity for anyone. I was so happy to find out I had been offered a place, and was lucky enough to find funding to pay half of my fees and shall be taking out a loan for the other half (which is really not cheap at all!). Although all of this has worked out well so far, I am still in need of money to actually move 200 miles away from home and live in a new town for the next two years. Of course, I will be looking for work as soon as I start the course but this campaign is to help me get started by funding a couple of months' rent and bills whilst I look for a part time job. 



The professional advantages of studying at this school are tremendous, with many of its students going on to win Oscars, BAFTAs and work on some of the biggest blockbusters out there! Not only do the students do well, but most of the staff are active in the film industry right now, so the teaching doesn't get much better. Being able to attend this school would be life changing, however without the funds to get started this may not be possible. 


So, what exactly would I be using your money for?

Well, as I said above I'm looking to use the money from this campaign to fund a couple of months of rent and bills when I move from Liverpool to Beaconsfield in January 2015. I have been looking at property renting prices for several weeks now, and £500 per month is pretty much standard (which is almost double what I paid for my last flat) so already this is a big financial blow!After looking at my past financial outgoings, I figured that I can probably cover utility bills and food for about £250 per month, which is cutting it pretty fine, but is more than manageable (4 years of being a student teaches you how to be poor :P).The third and final financial problem is that almost every property that I have looked at is unfurnished, meaning I'm going to have to buy a bed, a desk and chair, some kitchen utensils etc. This is likely to come to almost £500 after actually getting all of my stuff to Beaconsfield.So just to break that down for anyone who fell asleep whilst reading (I need to stop ranting!)
Rent - £500 per month
Bills/Food - £250 per month

Furniture - £500

Enough of the boring stuff, what do YOU get?

<p>Drawing from the 10 principles and influenced by the artistic
culture of Burning Man, Dragon Burn is an event where we celebrate art, music,
performances, workshops and other imaginative creative outlets in a safe
environment where you can be yourself!  Dragon Burn is scheduled to take
place May 27-29, 2016.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help fund various art pieces, workshops, and
transportation necessary to make Dragon Burn 2016 a reality.  We will need
to allocate appropriate funds to workshop collaborators, buy building
materials, and transport these pieces to the event site in Anji Forest,
Zhejiang Province, China.</p>
<p>****ART PROJECTS: YOUR PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION**** </p>
<p>In 2016, we have decided to bring a radical idea to Dragon Burn
– make admission ticket cheaper and then ask the attendees to become patrons of
the artists participating in this year’s Dragon Burn.  This opportunity
will allow people and event goers to fund a project they are most interested
in.  So far we have these projects committed:</p>
<p>A Full Roller Disco</p>
<p>Tinsel Town 2.0</p>
<p>The Christmas Bar Project</p>
<p>The Garden of Eden</p>
<p>Shanghai's Most Premier Body Paint Artist</p>
<p>The Shalanaya Experience</p>
<p>****BETTER EXPERIENCES****</p>
<p>By choosing which art you would like to contribute to, not only
will your experience at Dragon burn be more fulfilling, but you will also be
able to make a great connection with an artist you may not have been able to
contact before. You will also have a common bond with fellow attendees by
discussing which projects were your favorite and perhaps brainstorming ideas
for the future.</p>
<p>****WE""RE CRAZY, WE KNOW IT, WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU****</p>
<p>We are aware that this concept is much more different that any
other event that you may have been to, but we continue to push the boundaries
to give YOU, the participant of Dragon Burn, more of an opportunity to love the
event and feel like a contributing member as opposed to just an on-looker or
spectator.  Burning Man proves every year that crowd funding is the best
way to get the art you love to the burn, and now, we think it's time for you to
get that wonderful experience. </p>
<p>****EFFIGY****</p>
<p>This year’s effigy was designed by Nick Li.  Nick is
working as a product engineer and he is currently based in Shanghai,
China.  The effigy will be a 3.6m long dragon that will stand a little
over 2m tall at its highest point from the ground.  The dragon will be
made of wood that will use dado cuts to interlock the pieces together, and if
necessary, glue will be used to further solidify the structure.</p>
<p>We plan to do a test build as soon as possible before the
event.  The effigy team is currently planning to build the structure into
large sections, and then store the sections until the week of the event. 
The pieces along with other artwork will be loaded onto a truck and then
transported to the site the week of the event.</p>
<p>Potential Problems: Though ultimately hook screws and cables
might not be necessary, we are preparing that the dragon may not be stable
enough on the uneven floor at the venue site.  We are thinking of making a
base or fastening it down with cables.  We are currently working out these
issues.</p>
<p>Your contributions mainly go towards:</p>
<p>-Materials (wood, glue, hook screws, and cables/wires)</p>
<p>-CNC Mill Fabrication</p>
<p>-Storage</p>
<p>-Transport</p>
<p>Don't forget to submit your own art project or workshop or
volunteer application!</p>

to allocate appropriate funds to workshop collaborators, buy building
materials, and transport these pieces to the event site in Anji Forest,
Zhejiang Province, China.
****ART PROJECTS: YOUR PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION**** 
In 2016, we have decided to bring a radical idea to Dragon Burn
– make admission ticket cheaper and then ask the attendees to become patrons of
the artists participating in this year’s Dragon Burn.  This opportunity
will allow people and event goers to fund a project they are most interested
in.  So far we have these projects committed:
A Full Roller Disco
Tinsel Town 2.0
The Christmas Bar Project
The Garden of Eden
Shanghai's Most Premier Body Paint Artist
The Shalanaya Experience
****BETTER EXPERIENCES****
By choosing which art you would like to contribute to, not only
will your experience at Dragon burn be more fulfilling, but you will also be
able to make a great connection with an artist you may not have been able to
contact before. You will also have a common bond with fellow attendees by
discussing which projects were your favorite and perhaps brainstorming ideas
for the future.
****WE""RE CRAZY, WE KNOW IT, WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU****
We are aware that this concept is much more different that any
other event that you may have been to, but we continue to push the boundaries
to give YOU, the participant of Dragon Burn, more of an opportunity to love the
event and feel like a contributing member as opposed to just an on-looker or
spectator.  Burning Man proves every year that crowd funding is the best
way to get the art you love to the burn, and now, we think it's time for you to
get that wonderful experience. 
****EFFIGY****
This year’s effigy was designed by Nick Li.  Nick is
working as a product engineer and he is currently based in Shanghai,
China.  The effigy will be a 3.6m long dragon that will stand a little
over 2m tall at its highest point from the ground.  The dragon will be
made of wood that will use dado cuts to interlock the pieces together, and if
necessary, glue will be used to further solidify the structure.
We plan to do a test build as soon as possible before the
event.  The effigy team is currently planning to build the structure into
large sections, and then store the sections until the week of the event. 
The pieces along with other artwork will be loaded onto a truck and then
transported to the site the week of the event.
Potential Problems: Though ultimately hook screws and cables
might not be necessary, we are preparing that the dragon may not be stable
enough on the uneven floor at the venue site.  We are thinking of making a
base or fastening it down with cables.  We are currently working out these
issues.
Your contributions mainly go towards:
-Materials (wood, glue, hook screws, and cables/wires)
-CNC Mill Fabrication
-Storage
-Transport
Don't forget to submit your own art project or workshop or
volunteer application!

Here are some basic effects you can accomplish using The Butterfly Playing Cards:IMPOSSIBLE DIVINATIONThe cards are shuffled by a spectator and the spectator selects one without you looking. The card is retrieved and the cards are immediately shuffled by the spectator. All without you looking. You take the cards back and without looking at the faces or spreading the cards in any way, you know instantly what card it was.KNOWING THE MISSING CARDThe cards are shuffled by a spectator, taken behind their back, they take one from anywhere in the deck and hide it in their back pocket. Nobody, including the spectator, knows the identity of the card. They shuffle the cards again and give them back to you. You'll know the identity of the card in seconds without looking at the faces of the cards or spreading the deck in any way.CUTTING TO ANY CARD CALLED FORThe cards are shuffled by a spectator. They name any card they want and you are able to cut to that card without spreading the cards in any way.AND MANY MORE...Imagine being able to perform feats only possible using a memorized deck, but with a shuffled deck of cards. The Butterfly Playing Cards enable you to see the positions of all the cards in a shuffled deck.I developed the system for my own professional use.It is simple, logical, fast to read and easy to learn.I can't wait until magicians all over the world get their own Butterfly Playing Cards, begin exploring their capabilities and start coming up with new ways to use them.STRETCH GOALS300% RED - UNLOCKED!!!Every backer will be getting a BackerKit survey in early January, where you’ll be able to specify how many BLUE decks and how many RED decks you want.325% INTERIOR BOX DESIGN - UNLOCKED!!!There will be a butterfly pattern all over the interior of the tuck case. 350% UNMARKED BUTTERFLY PLAYING CARDS - UNLOCKED!!!

We will also print the exact same decks - only with no markings.


An unmarked deck gets very handy for that one spectator who is determined to find anything sneaky about the cards at all costs. If you switch the marked deck for the unmarked one, he doesn’t stand a chance.
You can also take any card from the marked deck and put it in the unmarked deck as an ultimate key card. Combining these two decks opens a new door to another room full of possibilities.
You can play card games with these. Or it is more fair to play card games with these.
You can give them to a non-magician friend as a gift.

The unmarked decks will be available in both red and blue and you'll be able to choose them through BackerKit. Every backer will be getting a BackerKit survey in early January, where you’ll be able to specify how many unmarked BLUE decks and how many unmarked RED decks you want.
  THE SECRET OF THE BUTTERFLIESbook and e-bookEvery pledge comes with a link to an online document describing the marking system and the way it works. You will be able to perform the effects presented on the videos once you understand the system.The Secret of The Butterflies book includes deep analysis of the effects and describes alternative handlings. There is a chapter on the history of the marking principles, additional routines, tips on spectator management and more. DESIGNThe cards were designed with two main goals in mind.
They have to be complex and irregular enough to disguise the markings.
They have to be pretty enough to justify their use over a more common deck of playing cards.
I sent the concept of butterflies on a floral pattern to my friend Stefan Eriksson. Stefan is a designer and a brilliant magician whom I met at the Stockholm University of Dance and Circus, where we both studied magic.We have made two different custom jokers and the ace of spades that are true to the overall theme of the back design. The rest of the deck has standard US faces as it is primarily intended for magic.QUALITYThe overall quality of the finished product is my highest priority so I talked to the major manufacturers of custom playing cards to find out which one can offer the best quality paper-stock, the best quality control and has the most forward thinking attitude.Cartamundi has it all under the roof of their mother factory in Turnhout, Belgium.Their new card stock is soft, the finishing feels amazing, and it is very durable. And their quality control is so strict, that any deck containing even a single card that is off-cut for more than 0,5 mm gets discarded.I visited the factory twice in the past year.

I
am a Berlin based painter interested in showing my art work to a broader
audience. I want to participate on an art fair in Berlin September 2014, called „BERLINER
LISTE“. This art fair allows you directly as an artist to show your work,
meanwhile most other art fairs are restricted to galleries. However art fairs
are most important to make a contact to galleries, potential buyer and collectors, as I
did successfull in 2011 at the same art fair.Art Fairs are expensive
Cost example for a booth of 10 sqmRent 1.250,00 €Catalogue publication 1 page 185,00 €Marketing fee 340,00 €Electricity 130 €Additional light bulb 75 €Total inclucing 19% Taxes: 2356,20 €Cost example for a booth of 30 sqmRent 3.750,00 €Catalogue publication 1 page 185,00 €Marketing fee 960,00 €Electricity 130 €Additional light bulb 75 €Total inclucing 19% Taxes: 6092,80 €Additional costs for framing, advertising media.aproximately: 1000 €I will try to raise 7500 € the money for a 30sqm booth plus additional expenses, the size I had 2011. Then I can show my big paintings 200 x 150 cm. If less money comes in, I will rent a 10 sqm booth and show smaller art work.For a discout of 50% I will sell my art work for a limited period till may 19th, the end of the campaign!

<h3>external vs. internal reflection</h3>
<p>A 20x24 foot cabin-like structure covered in mirrors. The reflective surface enables viewers to immerse themselves within the reflections and achieve a feeling of one with the vicinity. The exterior will have 4 enclosed installations that can be viewed through peepholes.

<h3>comfort from home comes from within</h3>
<p>The word <em>home</em> embodies safety, a place of belonging, a bubble where our domestic affections are meant to be centered. From early childhood onwards we are continuously looking for this wholeness within the home. In a society like today's, most of these impressions are mere illusions; shattered notions that have been embedded by past generations, visual stimulation and a longing for connection. The Little House quenches this longing through connection with oneself, confirming that comfort from home comes from within. The Little House is a window into the multiple perspectives we have of our own selves. A way to connect with every view of you. A way to understand that home and wholeness come from within. </p>

<p>When I read about the theft of Kathleen's 1957 Les Paul, it saddened me. I've never been much a musician but I love music, and respect how difficult an art this is.  Stealing someone's cherished guitar is just about as low as you can go. <br/></p>
<p>Kathleen has used this guitar both locally and internationally to bring joy to so many fans. Her music has touched me deeply, and helped me through some tough
 times. Songs like Hockey Skates and Goodnight California 
make me smile every time I play them. I know I'm not alone. I don't know Kathleen personally and have never met her, but have enjoyed many of her unforgettable live shows (one at Folkfest in particular).<br/></p>
<p>Now's our chance to give back, and prove to her that the music community is a strong one. If just a small percentage of her fans give $10, we'll have more than enough to get her a replacement guitar (I've checked online and they're priced in the $5,000 US range).</p>
<p>If her guitar is found/returned, this campaign will be closed and all funds raised up to that point will be donated instead to the Ottawa Music Foundation. Another good cause I'm sure we can all get behind.<br/></p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your donations and shares. <br/></p>
<p>I'm giving Kathleen the last word on this (from Oh, Canada): <br/></p>

<h3>We are the Doyles. We believe in grassroots and global living!</h3>
<p>David and Deborah Doyle and their 10 children (biological and foster) believe in connections to one another, to community, to the world. We have purchased two buildings in Western Maine, called it the ultimate recycle, and now use one as an international hostel, licensed by Hostelling International. Our hostel is close to Sunday River Ski Resort, the White Mountains, the Appalachian Trail, the Androscoggin River, many lakes, swimming holes, trails, hikes and more.</p>
<p>We would like to purchase local art and furniture for the hostel to inspire our visitors and to encourage our local arts community. Hostelling is a unique and authentic way to travel. People eat together, share information and travel stories, and visitors intentionally try to learn. (Hosts learn as well, I can assure you!)</p>
<p>Hostellers explore culture as much as they explore places. Here in rural Maine, our geography/climate is wonderful and inspiring....mountains, lakes, forests, seasons. Our people are equally as inspiring...working, farming, playing, celebrating. Connecting our international guests to our community and our community to international guests is our small way of building relationships with impact.</p>
<h2><strong>As we know one another, we begin to see differences as special, exciting, even essential rather than, well...just different. We believe we can spark these connections further through travel partnered with art.</strong></h2>
<p>Hostelling keeps travel accessible to all people even in a difficult economy. One night for one person at our hostel is $25! You cook your own food here and we all share a common area for good conversation, share our stories with a cold beer on occasion. We'd love to add local art and furniture to the experience.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
Sara Hemeon of Elements Art Gallery, Bethel Maine, has agreed to help us with our purchases. We can start this project with just $10 and enjoy the fruits of connecting through art. If we surpass our goal we will use the funds to further beautify the hostel setting (lights, outdoor landscaping and gardens, a little paint, more paint, new flooring in the bathrooms). We love local craftsman and small businesses as much as we love our local artists!!!  At $5,000 all of our cosmetic and maintenance needs will be met.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We want you to know that we are willing (and that we do!) work hard to keep our vision for the hostel going. This month we spent $2,500 to upgrade our plumbing system. We hope to bring pellet stoves to the hostel this winter. We are putting this project out there because it always seems to get axed from the budget and we don't want to let it go. Philosophically, we are firm believers that both beauty for its own sake (art) and productivity (plumbing and heating) bring different yet incredible rewards to our being. Realistically, our children are always wanting to be fed three square! :) Sometimes we can only have one thing we hope for....when community comes together, we know we can have more. And so it is that our crowdfunding campaign is born.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Real relationships are grassroots - continuing connections can be global. Imagine that one family can contribute to that effort even in a small way by introducing one traveler at a time to our neighbors, our culture and our own lives! One of the few times you can say (and really mean!) ""It's all good!!!</div>

We are teaching 12 high school students in Kliptown the basics of documentary photography and visual literacy. The workshop was developed by an American photographer who is teaching, along with three dynamic young African photographers. Our four photography instructors will teach the kids, as well as take their own photos, documenting the process. <br/></p><p>Two exhibitions of the work created by our students and instructors are planned -- one exhibition in Pittsburgh and one in Soweto. We believe it is important  that our students have the opportunity to see their own work in a gallery setting:  an exhibition of the work of the Kliptown Photo Project is scheduled to open at <a href=""http://mashumiartprojects.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mashumi Art Projects</a> in Soweto on July 25th, 2014. </p><p>Our second exhibition, in Pittsburgh, USA, will open in 2015; this exhibition is intended to introduce Kliptown to our own hometown.</p><p>Prints of the photographs will be for sale at both exhibition sites. This is really the culmination of our vision -- the idea that not only will our students learn skills, but will themselves be the agents of change for their community. Proceeds from the sales of photographs, both in Soweto and in Pittsburgh, will go to the Kliptown Youth Program. In this way, our students raise money for their own community, rather than accepting a philanthropic gift. </p><p>We want to empower our students. We want our students to communicate visually through documentary photography. Our students will come away from this workshop able to use photography to become powerful voices for their community, to advocate for themselves, their families and their neighbors. We believe that learning photography is a way to foster creativity and connection. </p><p>You can connect with them by helping us fund exhibitions of their work. </p><p>With financial support from our donors, we have already been able to fund instructors and digital equipment which would otherwise be unavailable to the students. During the workshop, in addition to teaching basic photography skills and visual literacy, we are teaching our students how to publish their photos to blogs and websites. The cameras our donors have helped us to buy will remain with the <a href=""http://www.kliptownyouthprogram.org.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kliptown Youth Program</a> so they may continue this initiative when our workshop is completed.</p><p>By helping us fund these exhibits, you will allow the students to realize the full potential of their work, both economically and as social capital. They will get to see their work in a gallery setting. And others will get a window into their world. </p><p>You can help them generate funds for their community. </p><p>By donating to our project you will be helping the students from a neglected and impoverished community get started on a path to creativity, entrepreneurship, and advocacy. We are teaching them skills which will help them succeed in the modern South African economy and by supporting our venture you can be part of this process.<br/></p><p>All of us together—you as a donor, us as facilitators, the photography teachers, and the students—can all work together to develop a photography program at the <a href=""http://www.kliptownyouthprogram.org.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kliptown Youth Program</a>, which will empower everyone involved and generate funds for the Youth Program. This is a small program with a big impact and your support is crucial to its success. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>What Does Your Money Pay For?</h3><p></p><ul><li>
<strong>THE EXHIBITIONS</strong><br/>Two exhibitions are planned, one in Soweto and one in Pittsburgh. We will be showing the work of our students and also, some of the work of our instructors, who will be documenting the week-long workshop. Photographs will be for sale and the proceeds from any sale will go to the Kliptown Youth Program. Your donation will defray the cost of printing and mounting these shows. We are bringing the cameras for the students to use and when our workshop is complete, the cameras will remain in Kliptown, for continued use at the Kliptown Youth Program. In this way, your money is not a one-time gift. Our greatest hope is that the project will remain sustainable under the guidance of the staff at the KYP, and we will be working with them to ensure that this happens. One aim of our project is to train students so that they can set up an on-line gallery to continue to document their lives and share their stories with the world. </li></ul><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">How Does This Benefit Kliptown? </span><br/></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE KLIPTOWN YOUTH PROGRAM</strong><br/>After the week-long seminar, KYP will be mounting exhibitions of the work. Prints will be available for purchase. All proceeds from the sale of photographs will go to the Kliptown Youth Program, which runs meal programs, tutoring, athletics and arts programs for the youth of Kliptown. Read more about the <a href=""http://www.kliptownyouthprogram.org.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kliptown Youth Program</a>.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL SKILLS</strong><br/>During our week-long seminar, our students will learn the elements of photography, not the least of which is to build a comfort level simply using otherwise unavailable digital equipment. The students will learn some fundamentals of shooting interiors, photographing portraits, and capturing social issues.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DIGITAL CONTENT</strong><br/>We will also be teaching the students how to work on online platforms, to upload photographs and create web-pages so they may continue to share their world with the rest of the world.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>A PLATFORM FOR NEW STORYTELLERS</strong><br/>One of the purposes of the Kliptown Youth Program is to eradicate poverty of the mind, body and soul. The Photo Project has taken that as our mandate, as well. Beyond learning new marketable skills, beyond sharing their world with us, beyond raising money, our greatest hope is that our students will learn to value their own stories and know that their voices matter.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Why Kliptown? </h3><p></p><p>Kliptown is one of the original areas established during the 1903 relocation process, when the ruling British minority forcibly moved African and Indian mine workers to an area outside of Johannesburg. Kliptown is part of the much larger area of Soweto, and was originally known as Klipspruit (""klipspruit"" translates to ""rocky river"" in Afrikaans).

</p></div>","What Is the Kliptown Photography Project?The Kliptown Photography Project is dedicated to teaching documentary photography and creating opportunities for the high school students of Kliptown, South Africa, one of the oldest informal settlements in Soweto.We are running a photography workshop at the Kliptown Youth Program from June 30th through July 4th. We are teaching 12 high school students in Kliptown the basics of documentary photography and visual literacy. The workshop was developed by an American photographer who is teaching, along with three dynamic young African photographers. Our four photography instructors will teach the kids, as well as take their own photos, documenting the process. Two exhibitions of the work created by our students and instructors are planned -- one exhibition in Pittsburgh and one in Soweto. We believe it is important  that our students have the opportunity to see their own work in a gallery setting:  an exhibition of the work of the Kliptown Photo Project is scheduled to open at Mashumi Art Projects in Soweto on July 25th, 2014. Our second exhibition, in Pittsburgh, USA, will open in 2015; this exhibition is intended to introduce Kliptown to our own hometown.Prints of the photographs will be for sale at both exhibition sites. This is really the culmination of our vision -- the idea that not only will our students learn skills, but will themselves be the agents of change for their community. Proceeds from the sales of photographs, both in Soweto and in Pittsburgh, will go to the Kliptown Youth Program. In this way, our students raise money for their own community, rather than accepting a philanthropic gift. We want to empower our students. We want our students to communicate visually through documentary photography. Our students will come away from this workshop able to use photography to become powerful voices for their community, to advocate for themselves, their families and their neighbors. We believe that learning photography is a way to foster creativity and connection. You can connect with them by helping us fund exhibitions of their work. With financial support from our donors, we have already been able to fund instructors and digital equipment which would otherwise be unavailable to the students. During the workshop, in addition to teaching basic photography skills and visual literacy, we are teaching our students how to publish their photos to blogs and websites. The cameras our donors have helped us to buy will remain with the Kliptown Youth Program so they may continue this initiative when our workshop is completed.By helping us fund these exhibits, you will allow the students to realize the full potential of their work, both economically and as social capital. They will get to see their work in a gallery setting. And others will get a window into their world. You can help them generate funds for their community. By donating to our project you will be helping the students from a neglected and impoverished community get started on a path to creativity, entrepreneurship, and advocacy. We are teaching them skills which will help them succeed in the modern South African economy and by supporting our venture you can be part of this process.All of us together—you as a donor, us as facilitators, the photography teachers, and the students—can all work together to develop a photography program at the Kliptown Youth Program, which will empower everyone involved and generate funds for the Youth Program. This is a small program with a big impact and your support is crucial to its success. What Does Your Money Pay For?
THE EXHIBITIONSTwo exhibitions are planned, one in Soweto and one in Pittsburgh. We will be showing the work of our students and also, some of the work of our instructors, who will be documenting the week-long workshop. Photographs will be for sale and the proceeds from any sale will go to the Kliptown Youth Program. Your donation will defray the cost of printing and mounting these shows. We are bringing the cameras for the students to use and when our workshop is complete, the cameras will remain in Kliptown, for continued use at the Kliptown Youth Program. In this way, your money is not a one-time gift. Our greatest hope is that the project will remain sustainable under the guidance of the staff at the KYP, and we will be working with them to ensure that this happens. One aim of our project is to train students so that they can set up an on-line gallery to continue to document their lives and share their stories with the world. How Does This Benefit Kliptown? 

FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE KLIPTOWN YOUTH PROGRAMAfter the week-long seminar, KYP will be mounting exhibitions of the work. Prints will be available for purchase. All proceeds from the sale of photographs will go to the Kliptown Youth Program, which runs meal programs, tutoring, athletics and arts programs for the youth of Kliptown. Read more about the Kliptown Youth Program.

CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL SKILLSDuring our week-long seminar, our students will learn the elements of photography, not the least of which is to build a comfort level simply using otherwise unavailable digital equipment. The students will learn some fundamentals of shooting interiors, photographing portraits, and capturing social issues.

EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DIGITAL CONTENTWe will also be teaching the students how to work on online platforms, to upload photographs and create web-pages so they may continue to share their world with the rest of the world.

A PLATFORM FOR NEW STORYTELLERSOne of the purposes of the Kliptown Youth Program is to eradicate poverty of the mind, body and soul. The Photo Project has taken that as our mandate, as well. Beyond learning new marketable skills, beyond sharing their world with us, beyond raising money, our greatest hope is that our students will learn to value their own stories and know that their voices matter.
Why Kliptown? Kliptown is one of the original areas established during the 1903 relocation process, when the ruling British minority forcibly moved African and Indian mine workers to an area outside of Johannesburg. Kliptown is part of the much larger area of Soweto, and was originally known as Klipspruit (""klipspruit"" translates to ""rocky river"" in Afrikaans). The settlement was at that time nothing more than a squatters camp with the rocky river running through it. In post-apartheid South Africa, Kliptown itself has seen both major development and neglect. There have been over 1,000 units of affordable housing built near this site, yet there are also still 11 informal settlements or shantytowns in the area known as Kliptown. We are working in a large ""informal settlement,"" or shantytown, which has been in place since the 1940s. The settlement lacks basic municipal services (water, sewage, electricity, etc.) and struggles with issues of air pollution, illegal dumping, and water pollution. Families live with up to four generations in small homes made from corrugated tin, cardboard and other found materials.The students must leave the settlement to go to school.All residents must leave to obtain medical services and purchase food and goods.

Despite such conditions, the community has been supported by initiatives like the Kliptown Youth Program. We hope that the Kliptown Photography Project can help foster similar support and growth. What If We Raise More Money Than Our Goal?What if we exceed our goal? Well, that's a great problem to have. Very simply, any money not used to mount the exhibitions of the work goes straight to the Kliptown Youth Program. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't donate, but you want to help, let us know. You never know, we might find something for you to do. If you can't donate, or you can't donate much, one of the most helpful things you can do is promote this project.

Thank you guys SO SO SO much for helping me reach my goal of $800 only 10 days after starting this campaign! Since there are 15 days left, several people suggested I make a stretch goal for the remaining time, so I've been thinking of what I really need to help me with both my collection and my career.</div><div>
<b>My next stretch goal is to raise $1,400</b>. My grandma gave me her old sewing machine (the model itself is about 17 years old, and it seems to be a limited run model) back in my freshman year of high school, and it has served me well for the passed 8 years amicably. Unfortunately, the bobbin winder has since broken, the spool stopper is too loose (you can imagine how fun it is to have spools fly out at an alarming velocity while sewing), and it's hard to find compatible parts (specialized presser foots for different hems/zippers, needles, etc), I've been wanting to get a new home sewing machine this year, as well as investing in a home serger machine in the future, so I thought this would be the perfect goal to make. Thank you again to everyone who has contributed, liked, shared, or just wished me good luck on this venture!

Known as a stronghold during the 1979 revolution, the city has rebuilt itself over the last forty years to include over 100 murals of community expression.</strong></p><p>In partnership with ICAS/Juntos Adelante, the artists will complete original murals that showcase and encompass the hope and values of community, access to care and health for all. Imagine San Francisco's Mission District without its murals, or the Sistine Chapel without a ceiling. Murals breathe life and cultural heritage.  Without them public settings can be cold and mundane, and our stories and history can be lost.  The old government health center, Centro de Salud, had treasured murals that are now gone after the building was decommissioned. Currently, the new facility has been built and there is a desire for paintings to once again beautify and narrate the history of this vital center for the people of Esteli. </p><p>Projects like these are at the heart of ICAS/Juntos Adelante's mission to promote health and human rights through cross-cultural exchange. And your support goes a long way towards providing the materials needed to once again revive Esteli's canvas. Every contribution counts, whether it's enough for a paintbrush or the value of a completed panel.  </p><p></p><h3><i>Please take the time to donate today.</i></h3><p><b>Thank you for your support!</b></p><p></p><p><em><strong>Salud para Todos</strong></em><em><strong> (Health for All) Mural Project</strong></em></p><p>Esteli, a small city nestled in the Northern Highands of Nicaragua, is known for its leadership during the revolution and women’s rights movement, its fertile lands of coffee beans and tobacco plants, and its preservation of artistic traditions. Despite being the second poorest nation in the western hemisphere, Nicaragua is a country rich in artistic traditions including the use of murals to educate and inspire. For the last ten years, ICAS/Juntos Adelante has collaborated with local health activists, civic leaders, and local muralists in Esteli, Nicaragua. With your help we are excited to embark on our next project, <em>to sponsor and complete five murals</em> in the the Centro de Salud Government Health Center. We thrilled to report that two murals are already finished. </p><p><strong>About us</strong></p><p>Juntos Adelante’s mission is to promote health and human rights through sharing resources cross-culturally. Our goals are to encourage self-sustainability and act as liaisons by sharing resources found in abundance in the developed world, with developing nations that don’t have easy access to such opportunity. This particular region lacks material resources due to impoverishment but has an abundance of creativity, talent, expertise, innovation and resilience.</p><p>In Esteli, we specifically seek out innovative proposals from local leaders that are community-initiated grassroots projects that strengthen the health infrastructure, promote human rights, and are sustainable. Nicaraguans are the ones who identify the needs of the community, develop proposals, request funding, and carry out the implementation of projects. Our previous projects include: a free standing midwifery clinic, extensive donations of medical supplies to the public health system focused on maternal health, diabetes, HIV, and other leading health problems, a cervical cancer prevention program, an HIV-prevention mentoring project, and health and human rights murals. </p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Esteli has a rich tradition of telling its history and displaying its values through murals. There are over 100 murals within the city limits and two prominent professional muralist groups. These murals showcase political struggles and focus on social justice themes. They offer a visual pictorial of the challenges that face the community. Like many urban areas, the afflictions of poverty can be felt throughout the city: high teenage pregnancy rates, poor health and high morbidity, lack of access to clean water, to name a few. Positive solutions are often incorporated in the murals about how to overcome the challenges such as the need for a clean environment and fresh water, how to prevent HIV, and how to promote health and well-being through exercise, diet and healthy lifestyle and important health exams such as pap smears. The nuances of the murals are clearly understood by the locals but may go undetected by a foreigner; these include poetry from local artists, imagery of thriving crops, and inspiring war iconography that depict peace rather than revolution. </p><p>In 2008, Juntos Adelante was approached by Julio Moreno, who as a youth in the 80’s was selected to maintain the rich tradition of murals as a member of a group of professional artists. Today, he is the leader of a group that works locally, nationally and internationally. Julio is also committed to keeping young teenagers out of gangs and the illegal drug trade, and offers them a chance to participate in the mural process. </p><p>In Julio’s own words, the Colectivo de Muralistas is a “group of five main members who are committed to the rescue of our values, identity, culture and committed to social awareness through murals”. In developing a mural the group works with the community from start to finish including brainstorming ideas, draft sketches, educating others on the theme of the mural while painting, and the actual work of painting itself.

Known as a stronghold during the 1979 revolution, the city has rebuilt itself over the last forty years to include over 100 murals of community expression.In partnership with ICAS/Juntos Adelante, the artists will complete original murals that showcase and encompass the hope and values of community, access to care and health for all. Imagine San Francisco's Mission District without its murals, or the Sistine Chapel without a ceiling. Murals breathe life and cultural heritage.  Without them public settings can be cold and mundane, and our stories and history can be lost.  The old government health center, Centro de Salud, had treasured murals that are now gone after the building was decommissioned. Currently, the new facility has been built and there is a desire for paintings to once again beautify and narrate the history of this vital center for the people of Esteli. Projects like these are at the heart of ICAS/Juntos Adelante's mission to promote health and human rights through cross-cultural exchange. And your support goes a long way towards providing the materials needed to once again revive Esteli's canvas. Every contribution counts, whether it's enough for a paintbrush or the value of a completed panel.  Please take the time to donate today.Thank you for your support!Salud para Todos (Health for All) Mural ProjectEsteli, a small city nestled in the Northern Highands of Nicaragua, is known for its leadership during the revolution and women’s rights movement, its fertile lands of coffee beans and tobacco plants, and its preservation of artistic traditions. Despite being the second poorest nation in the western hemisphere, Nicaragua is a country rich in artistic traditions including the use of murals to educate and inspire. For the last ten years, ICAS/Juntos Adelante has collaborated with local health activists, civic leaders, and local muralists in Esteli, Nicaragua. With your help we are excited to embark on our next project, to sponsor and complete five murals in the the Centro de Salud Government Health Center. We thrilled to report that two murals are already finished. About usJuntos Adelante’s mission is to promote health and human rights through sharing resources cross-culturally. Our goals are to encourage self-sustainability and act as liaisons by sharing resources found in abundance in the developed world, with developing nations that don’t have easy access to such opportunity. This particular region lacks material resources due to impoverishment but has an abundance of creativity, talent, expertise, innovation and resilience.In Esteli, we specifically seek out innovative proposals from local leaders that are community-initiated grassroots projects that strengthen the health infrastructure, promote human rights, and are sustainable. Nicaraguans are the ones who identify the needs of the community, develop proposals, request funding, and carry out the implementation of projects. Our previous projects include: a free standing midwifery clinic, extensive donations of medical supplies to the public health system focused on maternal health, diabetes, HIV, and other leading health problems, a cervical cancer prevention program, an HIV-prevention mentoring project, and health and human rights murals. HistoryEsteli has a rich tradition of telling its history and displaying its values through murals. There are over 100 murals within the city limits and two prominent professional muralist groups. These murals showcase political struggles and focus on social justice themes. They offer a visual pictorial of the challenges that face the community. Like many urban areas, the afflictions of poverty can be felt throughout the city: high teenage pregnancy rates, poor health and high morbidity, lack of access to clean water, to name a few. Positive solutions are often incorporated in the murals about how to overcome the challenges such as the need for a clean environment and fresh water, how to prevent HIV, and how to promote health and well-being through exercise, diet and healthy lifestyle and important health exams such as pap smears. The nuances of the murals are clearly understood by the locals but may go undetected by a foreigner; these include poetry from local artists, imagery of thriving crops, and inspiring war iconography that depict peace rather than revolution. In 2008, Juntos Adelante was approached by Julio Moreno, who as a youth in the 80’s was selected to maintain the rich tradition of murals as a member of a group of professional artists. Today, he is the leader of a group that works locally, nationally and internationally. Julio is also committed to keeping young teenagers out of gangs and the illegal drug trade, and offers them a chance to participate in the mural process. In Julio’s own words, the Colectivo de Muralistas is a “group of five main members who are committed to the rescue of our values, identity, culture and committed to social awareness through murals”. In developing a mural the group works with the community from start to finish including brainstorming ideas, draft sketches, educating others on the theme of the mural while painting, and the actual work of painting itself. Originally, ICAS/Juntos Adelante brought the members of the Colectivo de Muralistas into active dialogue with local women’s health providers and activists to ensure inclusion of gender equality, and maternal and reproductive health topics in the murals. ICAS/Juntos Adelante has financially sponsored seven murals that promote gender equality and include cervical cancer prevention, adolescent wellness and pregnancy prevention, healthy families and communities. Every funded mural has been completed efficiently and within budget.Email Bethany Golden bngolden@yahoo.com for more information about the project or check out www.mamasclinic.org to see another one of our projects in Esteli. Together, we look forward to restoring this culturally rich art that portrays both history and the possibility of the future.Photo Gallery of past muralsCervical Cancer Prevention MuralThe making of the Cervical Cancer Precention Mural Adolescent Health MuralCasa Maternal MuralMuralistas at work",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>JESSE’S STORY:</b></p><b>
</b><p><span>  My name is Jesse Rising Crow McKinney.
I’m an artist with severe Cerebral Palsy. 
After surviving many hardships including divorce, homelessness, living
alone without my daughter, and several unsuccessful relationships, I gave up
trying to find someone to spend my life with. 
However, I had forgotten that my profile was still up on one disability
dating website.  On March 31, 2014
however, out of the blue, I received the following message and had no idea that
I was reading the words of my soul-mate!..</span></p>
<p>“Hi my name is Laura,
my email is ***** and my Skype is ***** I don't have yahoo messenger although. I
too have staff that come everyday for 12 hrs. but I can be left alone for a few
hrs. and am not looking for a caregiver either just someone who can except me
as I am cause I can't change it. LOL.”</p>
<p><span>  Laura is the woman that I have waited
my whole life to meet.  I know this
sounds cliché but it is TRUE!  I want to
spend the rest of my life with her. I love her. 
She brings joy to my heart and love to my life.  It is hard enough for non-disabled people to
find their soul-mate.  So imagine how
difficult it is for two people with CP to meet, be compatible, and navigable
the logistics of a relationship.  .Plus,
we live in two different states. 
Therefore, we’ve created this fundraiser in order to make it possible
for me to relocate from Williamsport, Pennsylvania to Portland, Maine.  So Laura &amp; I can live and sell  our paintings together in the Portland area. However, enough from me, let my sweet Laura
tell her side of the story. <br/></span></p><p><b><span>BE SURE TO WATCH BOTH OF OUR SHORT DOCUMENTARIES IN OUR GALLERY SECTION.<br/></span></b></p><b>
</b><p><b>LAURA’S STORY;</b></p><b>
</b><p>Back in March I joined a disabled
dating site and within three days I messaged a man with CP who caught my
attention and he wrote back to me right away. We hit it off right away. We both
have the same kind of Cerebral Palsy. We also have so much in common as far as
dreams and hopes for the future. So we Skyped every day most days for hours
non-stop and found out that we both have been in really bad relationships.
Although our pasts haven't been so good, we both believe that our future could
be beautiful and amazing. He came to visit me for five days in May and it was
the most wonderful time in my life. I never thought I could love someone so
completely and feel so safe, as I do with him. I truly believe that he is my
soul-mate. And I want to be with him for the rest of my life. When he left to
go home it about broke my heart. Because the time just went so fast. But we
both have a lot to work on because we want to live and start painting and selling our work together by the Holidays.
And in order to make this happen, Jesse has to move up here for 30 days before
he can qualify for any type of services, like Mainecare, and so we are working on
this fundraiser so that he will be able to pay out of his own pocket for the
thirty days.<span>  I am also asking my family
and friends to help out in any little way possible. It will cost Jesse about $3500.00
for the first month on his own. That is why we are doing a fundraiser. </span></p>
<p>With Jesse, I could truly be myself,
and not be shy or timid at all. This may be a little bit personal, but he was
the first man who ever truly made love to me, in every sense of the word. And
now I know what it means to be truly loved by a man. We laugh a lot, and our
sense of humor is pretty much the same- I'm not saying that we are complete
carbon copies of each other- we do have some differences. But I can't imagine
my life without him. </p>
<p>If you are able to contribute, please donate via this site.</p>

time, and we both appreciate any and all help that you can give us. </p>

<div>I am a senior at Evanston Township High School and this is an independent project I am executing through a class I take at school.  To me, poetry is a way of expression and creation that is easily attainable in everyday classrooms, but isn't necessarily given as that.  Many classrooms teach poetry as just another assignment, something you need a grade for, therefore kids don't really get the right outlook on it.  Poetry is about accessing your emotions and descriptive language to further your writing in general, which I believe to be something very important to all students.  I am publishing an anthology of poetry with works from myself and from the students I am working with everyday.  Together, we can create something that the students will work towards rather than getting a grade for it but for the purpose of producing poetry that means enough to them that they will want to publish them and show them to the world.  </div> </div> <div> <h3>How?</h3>
<div>I need at $600 to pay for the actual publication of the book, which should be released in the middle of May. It is this expensive because I am giving all of the students that offer their poetry a book of their very own, so that they may one day show that they have given an expression of themselves to the world. </div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why?</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>I chose this project because of my history with poetry and writing in general.  I have done a unit on poetry every single year during school, and every time I treated it just as another unit rather than what it actually was; I never gave it the power it deserved.  During my junior year I was asked to submit my work to student produced show called Writers Showcase, which I didn't think much of, but I submitted anyway.  A few months later a teacher of mine congratulated me on my piece being accepted.  I was confused but realized that the board of students that chose pieces had actually picked mine.  I had many friends in the show, so it was exciting to know that they would later perform my work.  Weeks went by, and I got compliments from everyone in the show telling me how it was their favorite act and how they had to decided to end the show with it because it was the best, which was extremely flattering, but I didn't really believe it.  When I finally got to see the show, I waited for my piece and, surprisingly, was sweating a lot; I was so nervous to see my work being performed.  After the show, I was so impressed with the performance and how well they had interpreted the material.  I heard mumbling among the audience saying things like ""that last one was lovely,"" ""I loved the last one,"" ""It was so cute,"" and many more things.  It was not just flattering but all of this made me realize the power of poetry and how it can be read and understood.  By writing my poetry and sharing it, there was am impact. I was affecting myself and the people the poetry was shared with.  This experience changed my whole outlook on poetry, so now I know to write and share as much as possible because it isn't just about me anymore.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>In this project there is a risk of not raising enough money to publish enough books for everyone that contributes and supports it.  I believe that, with enough contributors, it will be an easy challenge to overcome, but I need your help! I need as many donors as possible, so if you decide to donate, please share and pass this project along! Even if you are not able to support us with money, please share and pass this project along! The power of one impact can ripple into an earthquake of change, but we need to start the impact here.  Share on facebook, instagram, twitter, by email, text, snail mail, and whatever other forms of communication you would like. </p>

We deal with drug users and people with HIV/AIDS. A lot of these cases come from, or end up in prison. These subjects are very taboo in the cultural society that is here in Indonesia. Our main goal is to educate people and create awareness about the situation and reduce the enormous stigmatisation that makes these peoples lives very difficult inside and out of lock-up. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1300528/files/20150316173840-001.jpg?1426552720"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span>

<p>We have an ongoing art therapy project at a local prison. We encourage the inmates to express themselves through art and creativity to give them a voice in a medium and environment where that does not exist. Some of the drawings the inmates produce are very strong and clearly show the struggles they are going through. Albeit technical skill is sometimes lacking, the effort and symbology of the work produced is what matters. </p>
<p>We believe in giving people in need the means to help themselves instead of handouts. We believe that a change in mindset and habits can go a very long way in the quality of life for a lot of marginalised people here in Indonesia.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1300539/files/20150316174251-002.jpg?1426552971"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our project aims to create a stream of revenue to help our efforts at the fringe of this cultural taboo. We are going to make and sell T-shirts and prints with art that the prisoners make themselves. All of the revenue will go towards funding our rehabilitation centre. Funding different projects that involve improving the quality of life for prisoners, drug users, people with HIV/AIDS and to educate the general masses about various issues that are an outcome of nothing else but ignorance and poor education. </p>
<p>If these issues strike a cord with you please help us see our vision come to fruition. If you like art that is raw and has a very real struggle behind it this will be something for you! </p>
<p>We are going to keep it simple. The art will be available as prints or T-shirts. We are going to create a website about our project with an online store to process orders and to provide a vehicle for education and revenue.</p>

</div></div>","We work with an NGO in Bandung, West-Java named Rumah Cemara. We deal with drug users and people with HIV/AIDS. A lot of these cases come from, or end up in prison. These subjects are very taboo in the cultural society that is here in Indonesia. Our main goal is to educate people and create awareness about the situation and reduce the enormous stigmatisation that makes these peoples lives very difficult inside and out of lock-up. 

We have an ongoing art therapy project at a local prison. We encourage the inmates to express themselves through art and creativity to give them a voice in a medium and environment where that does not exist. Some of the drawings the inmates produce are very strong and clearly show the struggles they are going through. Albeit technical skill is sometimes lacking, the effort and symbology of the work produced is what matters. 
We believe in giving people in need the means to help themselves instead of handouts. We believe that a change in mindset and habits can go a very long way in the quality of life for a lot of marginalised people here in Indonesia.  

Our project aims to create a stream of revenue to help our efforts at the fringe of this cultural taboo. We are going to make and sell T-shirts and prints with art that the prisoners make themselves. All of the revenue will go towards funding our rehabilitation centre. Funding different projects that involve improving the quality of life for prisoners, drug users, people with HIV/AIDS and to educate the general masses about various issues that are an outcome of nothing else but ignorance and poor education. 
If these issues strike a cord with you please help us see our vision come to fruition. If you like art that is raw and has a very real struggle behind it this will be something for you! 
We are going to keep it simple. The art will be available as prints or T-shirts. We are going to create a website about our project with an online store to process orders and to provide a vehicle for education and revenue.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are an ad hoc group of La Peña Cultural Center community members who came together last summer to make sure that the mural at this much loved and respected cultural institution remains on its facade.  Newly painted and ready to withstand the test of time for another two decades we want to see a third rendition of the Song of Unity mural. </p>
<p>The mural's cultural significance and content transcends time and the figures on the mural which were once chosen to represent the hopes of so many Latin American expatriates, exiles and immigrants cannot simply be put aside for new symbols hence our commitment to work together to raise the funding needed to pay the artists and obtain the materials needed for the mural renewal.</p>
<p>The figures of Victor Jara, Pablo Neruda, Gabriela Mistral, Cesar Sandino, Arzobispo Romero, Malvina Reynolds, Woodie Guthrie, Cesar Chavez, Violeta Parra, and Paul Robeson currently on the mural will remain on its new and third rendition with new figures added as selected in a random drawing of pre-qualified community suggested figures on February 8th, 2013.</p>
<p>Musicians such as John Santos, Rafael Manriquez, Holly Near, Los Peludos and Lichi Fuentes have come out to show their support through benefit concerts at La Peña and our families have come out to show their support both through ticket sales as well as through volunteer work.</p>
<p>This new rendition of the Song of Unity honors the legacy of La Peña's history while adding new figures and is the first time that the community at large has participated in the selection of new additions and is the organizing body around the fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>Please help us raise funds to pay the artists for their incredible work and make the dream of renewing this historic landmark a reality. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While a lot of labor is being donated by different members of the community with people carting about boards, doing sound, graphic design, painting the boards with sealant, etc. just to get things done, we do need to raise funds to pay the artists honorarium and to pay for materials, removal of the old mural and installation of the new mural. </p>
<p>The original La Peña Cultural Center budget for this renewal was over 80,000 dollars because of our community involvement we've been able to reduce the overall number to 40,000 dollars of which 14,000 is already being supplied through a grant from the Fleishhacker foundation. As a group we need to raise 26,000 dollars which will be raised with the campaign as well as benefit concerts at La Peña Cultural Center and any other creative means people think of to raise awareness and funds.</p>
<p>We will be offering posters, mural t-shirts, cds and artist sketches to donors depending on the size of their gift and we will continue fundraising until we reach our goal.</p>
<p>We will be posting updates throughout the campaign to let you know where we are and hope you will come with us on this journey.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hello, and welcome to our Indiegogo Campaign!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Who We Are...<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are working professionals with a common interest in making art.  <br/></p>
<p>""Bricks and Clouds"" is a Visual Arts exhibition to showcase our artwork and to explore the idea of living out one's artistic goals alongside professional ones.  For most of us, this is a big first step toward becoming full-time artists.  We hope to inspire other art enthusiasts to pursue their creative interests, and thus contribute to Singapore's growing arts and cultural scene.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Exhibition Details</b></p>
<p><b>Venue: Claire Loves Gallery, 14 Lorong Telok (Boat Quay), Singapore 049027<br/></b></p>
<p><b>Opening Reception: Friday 25 April, 7.30pm</b></p>
<p><b><b>Dates: 25 April - 11 May, 2014 (closed on 27 April, 1 &amp; 4 May)<br/></b></b></p>
<p>All are welcome!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need...<br/>
</h3>
<p>In order to create a memorable and engaging experience for our audience, we will need a total of US$4,600.  This will be used to pay for the venue rent for one week, and the art installation fees.  In addition, we want to provide a selection of drinks for our audience during the opening reception.  Last but not least, we want to engage as many people as we can with beautifully designed posters, flyers and postcards. <br/></p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of our projected costs:<br/></p>
<p>Venue rental:                      $1,500</p>
<p>Installation costs:                $800</p>
<p>Publicity materials:              $800</p>
<p>Reception refreshments:     $1,500<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Should the exhibition cease to happen (touch wood!), we will find another venue and/or a new set of dates, and the funds already collected will still be used as mentioned above. No matter what, we will have this exhibition because it is something most of us have been wanting to do for a very long time, and so we won't give up without a fight!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What You Get... (The Perks!)<br/>
</h3>
<p>As you can see on the right, there are various perks we are offering, ranging from a Thank You card personally signed by each artist, to a postcard/greeting card set depicting an artwork from the show by each artist, to customized artworks and portraits. </p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Bricks” represent the practical foundations and structures that ensure one’s survivability in modern society, while “Clouds” represent one’s dreams and desires and contain an element of freedom and unpredictability.<span>  Conversely, “Clouds” can also be the blurry distractions that prevent one from seeing reality, represented by “Bricks”. </span></p>
<p>We seek to explore the opposing yet complimentary forces between thinking and feeling, between what’s logical and illogical, between analytical thinking and following one’s heart.  Our artwork aims to create a visual experience for our audience through paintings and illustrations in various traditional art mediums.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Participate...</h3>
<p>Share our campaign with your family, friends, and social media followers. We want to reach all who have a passion for creating art, but are hesitant about pursuing their dream of showcasing their work and their talents.</p>
<p>Come to the opening reception on Friday 25 April and meet us! We would love to meet you! And invite your friends, family and everyone you know to attend as well. Even if you can't make it to the opening, just come on one of the other days.</p>

<p></p></div>","Hello, and welcome to our Indiegogo Campaign!

Who We Are...

We are working professionals with a common interest in making art.  
""Bricks and Clouds"" is a Visual Arts exhibition to showcase our artwork and to explore the idea of living out one's artistic goals alongside professional ones.  For most of us, this is a big first step toward becoming full-time artists.  We hope to inspire other art enthusiasts to pursue their creative interests, and thus contribute to Singapore's growing arts and cultural scene.


Exhibition Details
Venue: Claire Loves Gallery, 14 Lorong Telok (Boat Quay), Singapore 049027
Opening Reception: Friday 25 April, 7.30pm
Dates: 25 April - 11 May, 2014 (closed on 27 April, 1 & 4 May)
All are welcome!

What We Need...

In order to create a memorable and engaging experience for our audience, we will need a total of US$4,600.  This will be used to pay for the venue rent for one week, and the art installation fees.  In addition, we want to provide a selection of drinks for our audience during the opening reception.  Last but not least, we want to engage as many people as we can with beautifully designed posters, flyers and postcards. 
Here is a breakdown of our projected costs:
Venue rental:                      $1,500
Installation costs:                $800
Publicity materials:              $800
Reception refreshments:     $1,500

Should the exhibition cease to happen (touch wood!), we will find another venue and/or a new set of dates, and the funds already collected will still be used as mentioned above. No matter what, we will have this exhibition because it is something most of us have been wanting to do for a very long time, and so we won't give up without a fight!

What You Get... (The Perks!)

As you can see on the right, there are various perks we are offering, ranging from a Thank You card personally signed by each artist, to a postcard/greeting card set depicting an artwork from the show by each artist, to customized artworks and portraits. 
Some of the postcard images:

<p>I want to make the ""Spanking Lounge"" a permanent part of Karaoke Burlesque, but to do so, KB needs to own some ""room dividers"" or ""pipe and drape"" to create the necessarily private space at our host venue Hamburger Mary's.</p>
<p>Also, I'd love to advertise in PQ Monthly for our big ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY PARTY in JUNE, and help make June's KB our biggest and best party so far. If the money is enough, perhaps the Portland Mercury as well.</p>
<p>Maybe with help, we could buy a headset mic for the event, so we don't always have to be figuring out how to get off our clothes with one hand when we are singing.</p>
<p>So, at the suggestion of many friends, I am doing my first experiment in ""crowd funding"" in hopes that all the Karaoke Burlesque PDX fans, Nikki Lev the Glitter Beast fans, and fans of all or hot performers (Tuaca, Miss M, Marla Jaine, Daemon, Danni St Athens, Shugatits, Lascivious Lenore and MANY MORE) will help us make these goals happen as quickly as possible.

<h3>Kurzbeschreibung</h3>
<span>Mein Name ist Ingo Lamb und ich bin ein Berliner Fotograf, der mit einer festen Brennweite ohne Blitz auf Berliner Partys und im alternativen und meist queeren Nachtleben unterwegs ist. Dabei entstehen oft Aufnahmen, die die Schönheit, die Lichter und vor allem die einmalige Stimmung der Berliner Clubs wiedergeben. Im alternativen Bereich können Berliner Clubbetreiber und viele Showacts leider selten überhaupt Gagen zahlen – dennoch wünsche ich mir sehr, meine Werke in naher Zukunft in einer Ausstellung zu sehen, denn nur so werden sie vielen Menschen auch außerhalb der virtuellen Welt zugänglich. <br/><br/>Crowdfunding ist für mich daher der Weg, die notwendige Unterstützung zu akquirieren, die ein solches Community-orientiertes Projekt benötigt. Die Produktionskosten dieser Ausstellung überschreiten momentan meine eigenen finanziellen Mittel. Das positive Feedback zu meinen Aufnahmen hat mich aber bestärkt, sie zur Basis meines Crowdfunding-Projektes zu machen. Neben einer Ausstellung möchte ich mit dem Anteil, der darüber hinausgeht, meine Fotoausrüstung aufstocken, um so noch viele funkelnde Momente einfangen zu können.<br/><br/>Wer mich nicht bereits kennt, findet mich bei Facebook unter dem Namen Ingo Lamb - dort poste ich viele der Bilder, ähnlich einem fotografischen Tagebuch. Manche Arbeiten an themenbezogenen Fotoshootings sind auch direkt auf Partys inspiriert worden. Professionalität und Leidenschaft fließen stets in meine Bilder und Schnappschüsse ein. Neben dem ästhetischen Faktor halte ich es aber gleichzeitig für wichtig, den auch in Berlin immer wieder vorkommenden Übergriffen gegen Queers mit meinen Bildern einen Gegenentwurf vorzuhalten, der die bunte Schönheit und die Vielfalt des queeren Nachtlebens zeigt. Meine Bilder werben für Toleranz und ein friedlicheres Miteinander, bei dem wir uns alle friedlich begegnen.<br/>Für Eure Unterstützung danke ich Euch bereits im Voraus.</span>

<p><span>Hello my name is Ingo Lamb and I am a Berlin-based photographer, who takes photos with a fixed focus lens and without flashlight. My heart belongs to all the shining places of the Berlin queer underground places and I just love those colours of the night, the locations, the atmosphere and the people having a great time at the party. However, most alternative promoters and show acts in Berlin usually can't pay much to nothing for taking pictures of their extravagant events and crews. <br/>Crowdfunding is thus the right way for me to seek support for my personal wish – that is, to have an exhibition of my own pictures – to let a wider audience enjoy Berlin's queer glamour. The production costs currently exceed my own financial means. Yet as I received so much positive feedback for my pictures, I decided to make them the basis of my crowdfunding-project. With any excessive funding I will stock up my photography equipment to capture even more and even richer moments.<br/><br/>If you don't know me yet, you can learn about my person and work on my Facebook profile (Ingo Lamb). This is also the place where you can see the photographic diary of my past party shootings. Sometimes I am also inspired for more ideas for special photo-shootings at just those partys. The last series were two shootings with queer adaptations of some of my alltime favourite movies. <br/>As a person I also see that there is a still lot of harrassment and violence against queer people even in my beloved home city. I hate it and if things like that happen in the capital, you might imagine its dimensions in smaller cities and rural areas. My aim is thus to fight also with my art against all those prejudices that are sadly a daily part of many queers throughout Germany. My exibition shows the contrary - the harmony and the beauty of queer life in Berlin – to encourage people to get out, to be active for the visible diversity of this city and not only to attend the colourful CSD once a year. From my photographer's point of view it's all the same: if a man and a woman, two men, two women or two queers are kissing passionately, if they feel it, it's their right to show it to everybody. My art aims to improve visibility and tolerance and to encourage everyone to live and meet peacefully together. <br/>I am truly grateful for all your support and hope the perks will get used a lot.</span></p>

<p>We're a group of Photography graduates from UCA Farnham who are going to be exhibiting work at the Truman Brewery as part of the Free Range show (taking place between the 20th and 25th June).</p>
<p>This show is funded entirely by us, and so we are looking for you to help us out with some extra money to help pay for it. This exhibition is, and has been so far, a lot of work and requires a lot of money which we have been working on raising, but any extra money from you would be extremely helpful and greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>This exhibition is very important to those involved as this is our way of getting ourselves into the Art world, so you would be helping many aspiring photographers move forward in their working lives.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>The money you donate will be going towards: publishing catalogues for the show; building materials, paint, etc. for setting up and preparing walls in the exhibition spaces; vans and drivers for transporting materials and the work to the gallery; refreshments for the opening night; publicising; etc.</p>
<p>This is all far too expensive for us to fund out of our own pockets, so your donations will make it easier for us to create the amazing exhibition we are striving for!</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>This exhibition will give us UCA photography graduates the opportunity for our work to be seen by a wider audience. This will improve our chances of employment and provide new and exciting opportunities for us all. The more exciting and professional we can make this exhibition, the more likely we are to draw influencial people in to see our work, so we need you to help us make this possible!</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Spreading the word about the exhibition is also vital, so please give our website a gander <a class=""_553k"" href=""http://www.folka.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://www.folka.co.uk/</a>and pass it on to others.

The money you donate will be going towards: publishing catalogues for the show; building materials, paint, etc. for setting up and preparing walls in the exhibition spaces; vans and drivers for transporting materials and the work to the gallery; refreshments for the opening night; publicising; etc.
This is all far too expensive for us to fund out of our own pockets, so your donations will make it easier for us to create the amazing exhibition we are striving for!
The Impact
This exhibition will give us UCA photography graduates the opportunity for our work to be seen by a wider audience. This will improve our chances of employment and provide new and exciting opportunities for us all. The more exciting and professional we can make this exhibition, the more likely we are to draw influencial people in to see our work, so we need you to help us make this possible!
Other Ways You Can Help
Spreading the word about the exhibition is also vital, so please give our website a gander http://www.folka.co.uk/and pass it on to others. You can also follow us on twitter @whatthefolkaThank you for your time and help and please donate!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This past fall, our project began with a week long intensive workshop involving us graduate students from the Sculpture Department of the Tyler School of Art and MFA students from the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm. The workshop involved lectures and panel discussion with artists and organizations engaging with America's industrial heritage, as well as excursions to significant sites along the Rust Belt including: the Steel Stacks, Bethlehem, the Global Dye Factory, Philadelphia, the Warhol Museum, the Lackawanna Coal Mine, Lackawanna, and the Mattress Factory, Pittsburg.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Sweden and beyond.</strong></p>
<p>This May, the project will continue and the same group of graduate students and professors will come together again to further our research and create an exhibition and publication of our investigation and artistic collaborations.<br/>For the first week, we will embark on a second intensive workshop exploring sites of Sweden's industrial heritage in and around Stockholm including: <br/>the Ironworks, World Heritage Site in Engelsberg<br/>Sweden's weapons industry town Grängesberg, and The Nobel Museum</p>
<p>We will then spend the remainder of our trip in Berslagen, home to the historic Stripa iron ore mine using the mine as a platform for artistic collaboration and further development of the ideas and plans initially conceived in Philadelphia.</p>
<p><br/>Our research and conversations will culminate in a collaborative art exhibition and presentation at the Royal Institute of Art, accompanied by a publication documenting the project and the art works that come out of it. <br/>In addition to the exhibition, we are also developing a program with the curator of the museum, Ing-Marie Nilsson-Tarkkanen, which will allow forindividual and collective work, lectures, seminars, and meetings with representatives from the local business community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>
<p>Organized by Karyn Olivier, Professor at the Sculpture Department, Tyler School of Art, Sigrid Sandstrom and Carl Johan Erikson, professors at the Royal Institute of Art, Stockholm, our team includes Tyler MFA Sculpture candidates Adam Brody, Dani Frid Rossi, Jebney Lewis, John Emison, Misha Wyllie and Theresa Sterner, and the Royal Institute MFA candidates Gustaf Londre, Hanna Jagare, Linnea Rygaard, Linus Spangberg, Lisa Gideonsson and Ulrika Lublin</p>
<p><br/><strong>Funding and Expenses:</strong></p>
<p>For the second part of this inter-cultural collaboration, thus far we have happily received support from the Tyler School of Art including a $400 Dean’s travel grant to partially cover airfare for each Tyler graduate, $945 Vice Provost’s arts fund grant to cover part of our expenses which include: <br/>$6,000 airfare<br/>$400 in-country travel<br/>$1,500 publication <br/>$1,000 exhibition materials</p>
<p>At this stage we still need support and funding for the publication, and getting there ofcourse!</p>
<p>As emerging artists working towards terminal degrees in our fields and entering into the global conversation on visual culture, we Tyler Sculpture students are so thrilled to share this project with you, and appreciate any support you can offer as we embark on this exciting international collaboration between institutions and individuals, hopefully the first of many to come!</p></div>","Part 1: Welcome to the Rust Belt

<p> </p>
<p> 3:00-5:00- Arts After School (Kindergarden to 5th grade)</p>
<p>“Arts After School” is the perfect after school activity. Students will begin the session by starting their homework from school.

Arts After School will often be led by a local artist and will feature daily projects such as improvisation, sculpting, found-object art, collage, playwriting, and much more. Snack will be included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Friday and Saturday</p>
<p>6:45-9:00- Live Shows (All ages welcome, Pre-kindergarten students should be accompanied by an adult)</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Everyone Is Welcome!</strong></p>
<p>The Rumpus Room is pleased to provide scholarships for families in need. Through the aid of fundraising events and community donors, we are committed to providing arts-enrichment for every child.

<p><strong>Who am I and what am I doing?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jeanette Jobson.  I am a visual artist, living on the northeast coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Being surrounded by water, it, and the creatures that swim and live in it strongly influence my work, either through paintings of water and boats or my work with gyotaku (fish printing).</p>
<p><strong><em><img alt=""Flounder"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i320/IslanderNL/Flounderyellow.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""January print - Flounder""/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Fishy Bits!</em></strong> is an extension of my previous work with fish, which is documented  visually through images, video and print in <a href=""http://jeanettejobson.com/page/2487/the-gyotaku-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Gyotaku Project</a> on my website. This series of relief print in 2013 will broaden my experience in the technical aspects of printmaking and provide exposure for others to the range of cold water marine fish that live in these northern and island waters.</p>
<p>Each month in 2013 I will produce an original print of a different fish found in local water, creating a series of twelve unique pieces.  Each print is developed from my original drawing which is transferred or drawn directly onto a piece of lino and hand carved using traditional techniques and tools. The design and production of twelve prints in this 2013 series will give an “up close and personal” view of twelve individual species of cold water marine fish.  While stylized, the prints produced are based on real fish and are original representational pieces of art.</p>
<p><img alt=""February print"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i320/IslanderNL/Febfishprint2sm.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""February - Hooked on You""/></p>
<p>I use a variety of Japanese washi papers for printing, as well as printmaking papers and specialty handmade papers. My preference is for Japanese papers for the quality of prints they produce and the tradition behind them. Oil based inks are used to print from the carved plates, providing a crisp image with a lasting archival footprint. Each print measures 4” x 6” and has a generous border to allow for signature, framing and showcasing the piece.   The choice of paper type and ink colours will be my choice and will vary in each print run. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do I Need?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, I am producing my prints without a printing press, relying on a simple baren or wooden spoon to adhere the ink to the paper’s surface and hand pull the prints.  While this does provide a quality print, it is more time intensive and consistency of print images is not reliable, with more rejected pieces and waste of resources.  It also limits my range of printmaking to relief prints only.</p>
<p>A printing press would allow me to achieve consistent print quality and expand my range of printmaking into etchings, as well as enabling me to share.  Your contribution to this project will allow me to purchase an entry level Jack Richeson Baby printing press to ensure a consistent printing quality, as well as enable the purchase of additional supplies of lino plates, professional cutting tools, inks and Japanese papers to complete the project at the professional level that I strive to deliver to all my collectors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My Promise to Deliver</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for considering this project for a contribution!</p></div>","Who am I and what am I doing?
My name is Jeanette Jobson.  I am a visual artist, living on the northeast coast of Newfoundland and Labrador.  Being surrounded by water, it, and the creatures that swim and live in it strongly influence my work, either through paintings of water and boats or my work with gyotaku (fish printing).

Fishy Bits! is an extension of my previous work with fish, which is documented  visually through images, video and print in The Gyotaku Project on my website. This series of relief print in 2013 will broaden my experience in the technical aspects of printmaking and provide exposure for others to the range of cold water marine fish that live in these northern and island waters.
Each month in 2013 I will produce an original print of a different fish found in local water, creating a series of twelve unique pieces.  Each print is developed from my original drawing which is transferred or drawn directly onto a piece of lino and hand carved using traditional techniques and tools. The design and production of twelve prints in this 2013 series will give an “up close and personal” view of twelve individual species of cold water marine fish.  While stylized, the prints produced are based on real fish and are original representational pieces of art.

I use a variety of Japanese washi papers for printing, as well as printmaking papers and specialty handmade papers. My preference is for Japanese papers for the quality of prints they produce and the tradition behind them. Oil based inks are used to print from the carved plates, providing a crisp image with a lasting archival footprint. Each print measures 4” x 6” and has a generous border to allow for signature, framing and showcasing the piece.   The choice of paper type and ink colours will be my choice and will vary in each print run. 
 
What do I Need?
Currently, I am producing my prints without a printing press, relying on a simple baren or wooden spoon to adhere the ink to the paper’s surface and hand pull the prints.  While this does provide a quality print, it is more time intensive and consistency of print images is not reliable, with more rejected pieces and waste of resources.  It also limits my range of printmaking to relief prints only.
A printing press would allow me to achieve consistent print quality and expand my range of printmaking into etchings, as well as enabling me to share.  Your contribution to this project will allow me to purchase an entry level Jack Richeson Baby printing press to ensure a consistent printing quality, as well as enable the purchase of additional supplies of lino plates, professional cutting tools, inks and Japanese papers to complete the project at the professional level that I strive to deliver to all my collectors.
 
My Promise to Deliver
I am committed to complete this project in 2013 and deliver all perks as promised, whether full funding is received or not. Two fish prints are complete and the March print is being carved, ready for printing and release on the 15th of the month. A short video on the carving of the March block can be seen here and more information in the form of photos of new prints and process video will be provided monthly as the project unfolds and new prints are released.
I completed a year long project on gyotaku in 2010-2011, funded through the Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council, successfully producing more than 40 original gyotaku prints from a variety of local fish as well as a book, The Gyotaku Project, documenting the process.

you for taking the time to read this brief explanation of my project!</b></i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>New
York has put tons of money in marketing the city to promote and keep
tourism!  One thing I am so surprised of is they haven’t used one
of the most historical things that are right in peoples faces every

<p><i><b>The
STATUES!  </b></i>
</p>
<p><i><b>They
are placed all over the city and have more history behind them them
most people know! </b></i>
</p>
<p> <i><b>As
early as the mid 1800's these statues have been a fixture of New York
city.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Well
with my photography I plan to capture that history.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>I
am going to combine history art and technology all in one book! So
let me explain!</b></i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>There
will be 3 Types books of Statues of New York!</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>How
the book will look.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>As
you go thru the pages you will see beautiful color and black and
white photos of all the statues! Underneath each photo will be a
brief description. The description will have the name of the statue
the name of the artist when it was built and a street crossing
(example 53 &amp;3)</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>also
it will have an index reference number like (A23) you will go to the
back of the book in the index area and look for that number and you
will see a 5 sentence paragraph about the history of that statues!</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>This
is how we combine ART and HISTORY together.</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Now
the TECHNOLOGY. There will be a QR scan code on the inside of the
book. When the customer scans this code it will pop up a pin point
map of all the statues  all over New York City. Now you can go visit!</b></i></p>

</div></div>","Statues
Of New York
By
Tommy Parker


Thank
you for taking the time to read this brief explanation of my project!


New
York has put tons of money in marketing the city to promote and keep
tourism!  One thing I am so surprised of is they haven’t used one
of the most historical things that are right in peoples faces every
single day.
The
STATUES!  

They
are placed all over the city and have more history behind them them
most people know! 

 As
early as the mid 1800's these statues have been a fixture of New York
city.
Well
with my photography I plan to capture that history.
I
am going to combine history art and technology all in one book! So
let me explain!


There
will be 3 Types books of Statues of New York!
How
the book will look.
As
you go thru the pages you will see beautiful color and black and
white photos of all the statues! Underneath each photo will be a
brief description. The description will have the name of the statue
the name of the artist when it was built and a street crossing
(example 53 &3)
also
it will have an index reference number like (A23) you will go to the
back of the book in the index area and look for that number and you
will see a 5 sentence paragraph about the history of that statues!
This
is how we combine ART and HISTORY together.
Now
the TECHNOLOGY. There will be a QR scan code on the inside of the
book. When the customer scans this code it will pop up a pin point
map of all the statues  all over New York City. Now you can go visit!












The
3 types of  Books




First
and most important book is the small least expensive travel book
edition!
This
is the book that will be in every gift shop airport library  book
store world wide..  this is the book that will be around for hundreds
and hundreds of years!  

Tourist
will love grabbing this book at all the stores 



Second
Book 

Now
this book is going to be your Large Traditional Coffee table book
edition 

this
book will have all the same stuff as the smaller book does but will
be the one sold more online and library’s and Barnes and Nobles
Amazon etc
this
will also be a large selling book but more for looks 



Third
Book
Now
this is the Special collectors edition book!
There
will only be 300 printed each one in black velvet covers engraved in
gold lettering with the title 

 each
book will be presented with a set of white gloves and one signed and
numbered print of one statue  



I
have hired on a historian for this book to work on the historical
content of this book Danny Ivetic 

I
am talking to 2 different publishing companies right now who are
guarantee me to be in Barnes and noble and over seas in Europe and
Asia 

also
amazon and gift stores all over NYC and beyond.  To help create a
best seller!

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is who we are: two transformative artists on the threshold of an important opportunity. Elijah Kane Chong has been accepted into the <a href=""http://swc.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182); text-decoration: none !important; cursor: pointer;""></a><a href=""http://swc.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Masters of Art Therapy and Counseling program at Southwestern College</a> in Santa Fe, New Mexico. This is an achievement he has been working towards over the past three years. This wondrous opportunity will allow him to transmute his personal work as an artist into a practice of healing. Joining him on this adventure, Aubrey Schwartz is a theatre mask designer and massage therapist who will utilize her time in Santa Fe expanding her knowledge of therapeutic techniques and modalities at the <a href=""http://www.santafeschoolofmassage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.santafeschoolofmassage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Santa Fe School of Massage</a> and the <a href=""http://www.whitecloudinstitute.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.whitecloudinstitute.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Cloud Institute</a>. Together we are on a mission of furthering our education and expanding our talents. This is our cause, to combine our efforts in the formation of a holistic healing practice that addresses the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of the client. Much work and energy remains to be put into achieving this goal, and we are committed and ready to follow through, but we are in need of some assistance in taking the next step and relocating from New Orleans to Santa Fe. Elijah's first semester at Southwestern College begins in January; the immediacy of this move and the help that we need is not lost on us.</p>
<p><b>The Gift of Giving</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">There is a growing and crucial need for mental health services in our global society.

</div></div>","Friends and Family, Friends of Family, Family of Friends,

Here is the truth of it. The Good Work and the Righteous Path is service unto others. Through the wisdom of the unity of all, we know that to render service and aid to others is an act of devotion to the deepest kernel of the self. This is our intention, to grow as individuals and achieve heights from which we can rightfully lend aid to those in need. 

This is who we are: two transformative artists on the threshold of an important opportunity. Elijah Kane Chong has been accepted into the Masters of Art Therapy and Counseling program at Southwestern College in Santa Fe, New Mexico. This is an achievement he has been working towards over the past three years. This wondrous opportunity will allow him to transmute his personal work as an artist into a practice of healing. Joining him on this adventure, Aubrey Schwartz is a theatre mask designer and massage therapist who will utilize her time in Santa Fe expanding her knowledge of therapeutic techniques and modalities at the Santa Fe School of Massage and the White Cloud Institute. Together we are on a mission of furthering our education and expanding our talents. This is our cause, to combine our efforts in the formation of a holistic healing practice that addresses the physical, mental, and spiritual needs of the client. Much work and energy remains to be put into achieving this goal, and we are committed and ready to follow through, but we are in need of some assistance in taking the next step and relocating from New Orleans to Santa Fe. Elijah's first semester at Southwestern College begins in January; the immediacy of this move and the help that we need is not lost on us.
The Gift of Giving
There is a growing and crucial need for mental health services in our global society. By supporting our cause, you will be helping one couple on their journey to fill that need. Your contribution will germinate into a blossoming practice of healing and will emanate with every individual who will be helped along the way. 





Every major move in life comes with costs and risks. In anticipation of this, we are initiating this campaign to help cover the expenses of relocating and starting a new chapter. We are hoping that with your kindest support we can raise enough money to ensure a stress free move. Any amount that you can help with is graciously appreciated and all contributions will be put forth to this transition.

We are energetic beings, forever grateful, who believe in the law of reciprocal exchange, which is why we aren't asking for your help for nothing in return.

The uniqueness of this film lends itself to an equally unique bundle of perks for donors. Please click on the ""Perks"" page of this campaign to learn more!

The Impact
We live in an incredibly technical and complicated time, where messages and images are sent and received immediately. Part of the charm of this film is the fact that it transports us to a much simpler and less complicated era. The team we have assembled has an uncanny ability to bring the 1930's to life, as evidenced in the powerful theatrical trailer attached to this campaign. Additionally, the importance and size of this film will generate many jobs for more talented people.

Risks & Challenges
Recreating the late 1930's presented unique and complex challenges for our talented production team. This became evident during the filming of the theatrical trailer. We've learned from this experience. We successfully produced and edited two and a half minutes of film and transported our audience to that era.

During the interview at the artist studio, he or she will take us through the process of how the art is created. This will give us a behind the scenes look at the wonder of art.</p><p>When the art is completed, ROAD ART GLLERY will take the actual art and the artist on the road, transforming to a live Art Show on wheels. Lisa, the featured artist and the art will help educate the audience on the process of creating art from its conception to the finished product.</p><p>Once the gallery on wheels has reached its destination is when the real drama begins. Through hidden cameras, and probing questions from Lisa, viewers will see and hear the true thoughts about the art and the artist.</p><p>The show is mobile, we will be able to travel to different states and locations such as rural towns, small cities, inner city schools, senior citizens homes, big and small events.

During the interview at the artist studio, he or she will take us through the process of how the art is created. This will give us a behind the scenes look at the wonder of art.When the art is completed, ROAD ART GLLERY will take the actual art and the artist on the road, transforming to a live Art Show on wheels. Lisa, the featured artist and the art will help educate the audience on the process of creating art from its conception to the finished product.Once the gallery on wheels has reached its destination is when the real drama begins. Through hidden cameras, and probing questions from Lisa, viewers will see and hear the true thoughts about the art and the artist.The show is mobile, we will be able to travel to different states and locations such as rural towns, small cities, inner city schools, senior citizens homes, big and small events. This will help introduce art to many locations where it would not normally be accessible.We believe ROAD ART GALLERY will be popular because first of all, virtually every home in the world has art in some form and we believe everyone yearns to be an artistic. We have many ideas that would make this show interesting and dramatic ie: Some shows will pit one artist against another. Some shows will pit the public against the art and the artist.

<p><b>I have begun perhaps the most rewarding photographic project of my life.</b></p>
<p>While working on assignments, producing marketing photographs in retirement communities I began to work with the many WWII Veterans who were residents. It was easy to spot these folks - many proudly wear ball caps, adorned with campaign medals and ribbons attached. Indeed, the beginning of this project started when a Veteran asked me to copy a picture he had of the airplane and crew he flew combat missions with, from bases in England. It was an emotional moment for me to realize I was talking to one of the airmen who flew some of the most dangerous combat missions of the war. These men and women are special to me. My father was a WWII veteran. He joined the Army Air Force as an airplane mechanic, repairing the B-29 Bombers in the South Pacific that brought the war to the Japanese home islands, and saved countless young lives.</p>
<p><b>Photographing these Veteran portraits at various locations around the country, has been my passion for the last two years. </b></p>
<p>I have photographed close to two hundred Veterans, with whatever items that have survived, (hats, medals, jackets and photos) but especially pictures of themselves - portraits, or other photographs taken during their time of service. As a result, I am developing an exhibit titled ""When we were young"". Pictures of the young person who went off to war, within a portrait of the senior who carries those memories with them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/15987/files/20130816104714-39c7c6264e3c1cd0f5642807fbd83b4d_large.jpg?1376675234"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Though military conflicts are generally defined by the political, economic, territorial causes and results - my intention of these portraits, is to show the the beating heart of the individual's military experience - memories that live with these people forever. The images and voices of rank and file Veterans have rarely been acknowledged or shared beyond intimates, many have related experiences they have never voiced before. I hope you will join me through Kickstarter to give significance to these individuals and their unique testament and perspective on their military service, and the opportunity to share that record with a larger audience. I have made a start and am hoping to continue to portray these individuals who have been sent in harms way. The portraits we have produced are amazing!<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/15989/files/20130816104739-d0010ed90bb338ff83bf522c43422a7b_large.jpg?1376675259"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My goal is to raise enough money to produce, print, and frame a total of 25 - 24x30 art prints/interviews to exhibit. Each portrait will be accompanied by a statement culled from my interviews with each veteran, about how their time of service affected their lives. Excerpts from their interviews will be printed and displayed beside their portrait. Some statements are light-hearted, and others are more poignant. These statements, alongside the portraits, will bring another dimension to the ""Individual"" who had to do-the-work of military operations and give the viewer a feeling of what is was like to ""walk in their shoes.""</p>
<p>The money raised will go toward the image processing (retouching, color-management, proofing, etc.) required for such large prints, the cost of printing, the framing, and crates for transporting the exhibition. Creating the presentation and preparing the images for traveling to larger venues is beyond my out of pocket budget. That is why I am putting this proposal before you on Kickstarter. As donation rewards, the prints and books offered will be my heart felt attempt to share my enthusiasm of this project with you.  Any money raised beyond the funding goal will be used for additional portrait shoots and to further the project.</p>

<p><strong>The context</strong></p>
<p>Ten years ago no one believed thay you'll be communicating more online through a portable screen, than in real life.

<p>The “crowd

producing Grand Mezcal La Escondida for you, It is more important to interact

<p>We anticipate start delivering our first and unique 2014 production of La Escondida in the first quarter of 2015. </p>

<p><b>Just how unique is La Escondida 2014?</b></p>
<p>FOR REAL! IT S UNIQUE. Our first production 2014 is only around 3000 liters of the best Mezcal you can have. This will be sold only during the crowd-mezcal passion campaign  in Partner with Indiegogo.  </p>

<p><b>Where will the

<p>Currently you will pick it up in Mexico City and Geneva, Switzerland.
However, during the course of this campaign we will visit probably most of the

pickup places will appear very soon and we will keep you updated how would you get your bottle.</p>
<p><b>Are you
shipping Mezcal direct in Europe, are you shipping my tote bag as well?</b></p>
<p>We are currently working on it but most probably yes. When your

<br/><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS
MEZCAL ?</b></p>
<p>Mezcal is a
Mexican spirit which is been around for more than 200 years. It is 100% handcrafted
from agave, a plant sometimes wrongly confused with cactus. One of the most
sophisticated spirits on the market, mezcal has given some connoisseurs a new perspective
on what it means to drink and eat.</p>
<p><b>So, tell me:
Is mezcal the same thing as tequila ?</b></p>
<p>No. That would
be like saying that grape juice is the same as wine. Although both are made from
the agave plant, the production process and variety of agave used to produce mezcal
are not the same as those used in the making of tequila. Another thing that
sets mezcal apart is its delicious, smooth smoky flavor.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Is mezcal
that cheap alcoholic drink I just bought in Mexico with the worm inside the
bottle?</b><br/></p>
<p>That
question has two answers: NOT TRUE! NOT TRUE! I remember watching a movie where
Antonio Banderas drank mezcal on some hacienda in the middle of nowhere while fighting
a bunch of bad guys. He managed to impress the ladies  by chugging the whole bottle and finally swallowing the
worm. That was probably the worst publicity the mezcal industry has had over the
past 40 years. Within the industry itself,  a lack of sector-wide rules and transparency made matters
even worse. The raw material, agave, needs at least five years before it is
ready for the mezcal distillation process. In addition, the ancestral production
methods are time-consuming and tedious, and many  years of experience are needed to gain full mastery of them.  Many years
ago, some “wanna-be” producers took advantage of the less-than-transparent
practices prevalent at the time and used the worm as a marketing ploy to sell something
they called mezcal, even though it really wasn’t. However, the industry has
seen some positive changes over the past 10 years, and today those of us who
are passionate about mezcal can’t wait to teach the rest of the world what
Grand Mezcal is really all about.</p>

buildings, and a play performed— in the middle of June— on a giant pile of
snow. Some pieces are designed for as few as 5 people at a time, with others
accommodating as many as 200. We are committed to presenting innovative,

</h3><b>            European effect on canvas by Artist - KAMAL NAYAN JAIMINI</b><br/><br/><p>   Reality with
philosophical effect is beautifully expressed in the paintings of Kamal Nayan Jaimini,
the rising Artist of modern age. He has made a place for himself as a torch-
bearer of the growing influence of philosophy in the world of modern Art
painting.</p>
<p>   Jaimini's pursuit of Art
started at the outset of his childhood as he was born in a cultured family
dedicated to Art. His father Shri Brajendra Sharan Sharma, who was educated at
the Rajsthan School of Art Jaipur, started training the boy at the early age of
two in sketch and memory drawing. Also in the absence of the father the child
used to play with colours and create some attractive paintings. At the age
of three, as a young child Kamal Nayan produced a lovely painting on the big
canvas and thus indicated that he would become a famous Artist in the
future. </p>
<p>    Thereafter Kamal Nayan
received training under Art teacher Shri Kripal Dutt Tripathi, Lord Hording
Scholar Gold Medalist.  Also, Shri Tripathi, the renowned sculptor and painter imparted
all comprehensive training to Kamal Nayan for the rest of his life. With this
valuable guidance of his worthy Guru, Kamal Nayan, supported by his hard work,
fixed his future destinations.</p>
<p>   The one remarkable
characteristic of Kamal Nayan Jaimini is the beautiful effect European Art. This
ornamentation is the gift of the renowned American Artist Sir Alfred Josef
Valerio who was associated with the well known European artists, namely Salvador
Dali, Andy Warhol, and Norman Rockwell.</p>
<p>     Kamal NayanJaimini is established as
a worthy modern painter out of enthusiastic hard work, by the blessing of God, and by inner talent. He
is respected especially for his philosophical paintings that are mostly in oil
colours. Also his paintings made out of textures in the mix media Art are
remarkable. It is most interesting to look into the philosophy of life in relation to the colour
combinations that makes the portraits lively.</p>
<p>    Commendable is the
portrait Art of Jaimini. He has portrayed a number of heroes -  especially
Hollywood star Julia Roberts, pop star Michael Jackson and the famous
journalist Khuswant Singh. The painting wizard Kamal Nayan Jaimini has proven
his command over Landscape, still life, and figurative composition equally
well.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/709261/files/20140710164814-KAMAL_painiting_1_AFS_099.JPG?1405036094"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>                                                                - $ 322.02 Dollars Canadian<br/>                                                                - $ 302.53 Dollars U.S.A.</p><p><br/></p><h3>                   THE VISION - by Jaimini Art<br/>

cards by knife strokes in oil colours. Kamal’s miniature work by oil colours
without brush in small cards, calls for direction and hard work. Among the
greeting cards created by him, main landscape and portrait are specially
popular of late.  His hand painted cards are getting more popular than printed ones

philosophical effect is beautifully expressed in the paintings of Kamal Nayan Jaimini,
the rising Artist of modern age. He has made a place for himself as a torch-
bearer of the growing influence of philosophy in the world of modern Art
painting.
   Jaimini's pursuit of Art
started at the outset of his childhood as he was born in a cultured family
dedicated to Art. His father Shri Brajendra Sharan Sharma, who was educated at
the Rajsthan School of Art Jaipur, started training the boy at the early age of
two in sketch and memory drawing. Also in the absence of the father the child
used to play with colours and create some attractive paintings. At the age
of three, as a young child Kamal Nayan produced a lovely painting on the big
canvas and thus indicated that he would become a famous Artist in the
future. 
    Thereafter Kamal Nayan
received training under Art teacher Shri Kripal Dutt Tripathi, Lord Hording
Scholar Gold Medalist.  Also, Shri Tripathi, the renowned sculptor and painter imparted
all comprehensive training to Kamal Nayan for the rest of his life. With this
valuable guidance of his worthy Guru, Kamal Nayan, supported by his hard work,
fixed his future destinations.
   The one remarkable
characteristic of Kamal Nayan Jaimini is the beautiful effect European Art. This
ornamentation is the gift of the renowned American Artist Sir Alfred Josef

Dali, Andy Warhol, and Norman Rockwell.

a worthy modern painter out of enthusiastic hard work, by the blessing of God, and by inner talent. He
is respected especially for his philosophical paintings that are mostly in oil
colours. Also his paintings made out of textures in the mix media Art are
remarkable. It is most interesting to look into the philosophy of life in relation to the colour
combinations that makes the portraits lively.
    Commendable is the
portrait Art of Jaimini. He has portrayed a number of heroes -  especially
Hollywood star Julia Roberts, pop star Michael Jackson and the famous
journalist Khuswant Singh. The painting wizard Kamal Nayan Jaimini has proven
his command over Landscape, still life, and figurative composition equally

    Portraits of fair sex speak for Kamal Nayan’s practice, deep insight, and perfect maturity. Philosophical effect in his
art can be possible only through extraordinary talent. Jaimini's philosophical
paintings are full of sublime beauty of the fair sex. The instinctive inclination
toward the opposite sex has been addressed in Jaimini's paintings.    Jaimini's philosophical
creation namely 'Yoga & Maya' has been appreciated by a of number of Art
critics in various art exhibitions.  Also, his knife - strokes painting,
'Krishna With Cow' has elicited praise. Worth mentioning is the name of Hollywood
movie star Madame Sasha Stuart who praised the above mentioned two paintings
during her last visit to India. Amongst other fans of Jamini's Art are the
British painter Alfred Josef Valerio, and Indian Art fans Harrywiz couple,
Chester and David, who have spoken highly of Jaimini’s Art.
    Creative
modern artist Kamal Nayan Jaimini has proven his excellence at big size canvas
and small size paintings. Equally well Jaimini's choice of knife strokes in the
greeting cards has also been appreciated. He has specially created greeting
cards by knife strokes in oil colours. Kamal’s miniature work by oil colours
without brush in small cards, calls for direction and hard work. Among the
greeting cards created by him, main landscape and portrait are specially
popular of late.  His hand painted cards are getting more popular than printed ones
in foreign countries and more and more in demand. Jaimini's Hollywood star
portrayed greeting cards are being increasingly liked abroad.card                                      ""Indian Landscape""   The elevated Art of Kamal Nayan
Jaimini,  and his expertise, is related to his multifold genius. It is worth mentioning,
that he holds seven Master Degrees in seven subjects under the Art faculty as
well as, Hindi, Urdu, English, Ancient Indian History, Philosophy, from Agra University,
and Post Graduate in Sanskrit from S.S.S. Varanasi, and Drawing & Painting
from Jiwaji University Gawalior.
  Jaimini was fond of calligraphy
since childhood and he continues the same. When he was studying in Urdu M.A., some of his paintings bear Urdu signatures along with those in Hindi and
English.
    According to Jaimini he
remembers the 6th January, 1987 for his meeting with the renowned painter Mr.
F.N. Souza, under the auspices of Triveni Kala Sangam, New Delhi - the face to face
exchange of ideas between a well known painter and a young one, was noteable.
Mr. Souza had seen in Kamal Nayan a famous Painting Artist of future.
    Painter Kamal Nayan
Jaimini says that Art is the easiest means to arrive at the Art of living which
he believes in converting the same to canvas.

The RIZE captivates childlike curiosity and amazement when people view it, and it makes for the ultimate distraction on your desk or centerpiece in your office.Even after interacting with these displays for years they still give me inspiration when I see them in action.The sculpture itself is also a feast for the eyes, created with a variety of different metals and finishes:Every square inch of the RIZE is hand crafted and museum worthy.It's also 100% made in the US, right here in our studio in Opelika, Alabama. We are also shipping anywhere in the US for FREE!This project has taken years of research to perfect, and now we even have colored ferrofluid available.  4 metallic color-shifting pigments are available: Gold

 
 Red-Orange Color Shift

 
 Blue-Purple Color Shift

 
 Purple-Pink Color Shift  Each RIZE also includes a powerful handheld N52 neodymium magnet.

 
 The handheld magnet also seperates into 2 smaller magnets for more interaction:

 
 My Background and InspirationHey I'm Matt, and I've been working with ferrofluid full time for the last 3 years. I have a degree in Electrical Engineering and have always enjoyed creating art. After surviving a plane crash I decided that life was too short to waste in a cubicle and that I would pursue my dream of inventing cool products full time. I like to blend science with art in my creations and my hope is that they will help inspire the next generation of thinkers and inventors!Pledge now and help me bring the RIZE to life!Thank you,Matt Robison",8.0,7,"1 Campaign

<h3>Here's The Deal</h3>
<p>I would like to explain what contributor's perks will be, explain a little bit about the touring mission itself, and how this is all interrelated:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a travelling saxophonist and beer blogger who couldn't be happier with my team of musicians and the national community we've come in contact with.</li>
<li>This calendar resembles community and a growth of love and life in a world struggling to stay together. Since the bus has broken down, we've had to cancel shows coming back home and we may miss Thanksgiving with the families. BUT...since the engine blew, the Arizona community has rallied together putting last minute shows together, and helping with rides and accommodations.  </li>
<li>Contributors will help put our nationally touring band back on the road and promote uplifting music/live entertainment changing people's days for the better a show at a time.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Follow me to the Perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Center needs $4,000 to put a new engine in the tour bus. George, the bus, has lost doors, cracked radiators, had coolant leaks, and broken down in the desert twice. He's very moody! HA HA</li>
<li>This year's perks are a triple threat:</li>
<li>--A sexy calendar for you to love 24/7 365 days a year</li>
<li>--Community Center's Current Album ""Horns &amp; Thorns""</li>
<li>--An exclusive release of Community Center's Newest Album with stickers and Pins</li>
<li>--A never before seen experimental holiday album for the Holiday Season</li>
<li>Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.</li>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>This Calendar has always been for fun, but this year there's a cause near and dear to my heart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution keeps me in your house when I can't be there. I miss my community every day I'm gone, but every day someone smiles or tears up during our shows, it's worth it. </li>
<li>We've run 3 successful campaigns and I'll do my darnedest to make a 4th, but I'll need your help.</li>
<li>I only have my desire to be a ham and my hairy chest to offer you, but by golly, you're going to love this calendar and many more for years to come.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This campaign comes from a place of extreme caution as I don't like asking for charity. I'd rather be helping someone out than asking for the help, but sometimes as hard as you fight, obstacles get in the way, and you need someone to lift you back up.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm hard working, tenacious, and unwilling to give up.</li>
<li>I will keep pushing the boundaries with the community back home, and listen to everyone's ideas to keep you getting a great calendar.</li>

<h2>Nobody Home</h2>
<p><strong>My name is Josef, I'm 17 years old and I was recently studying abroad, in Bristol, England. During my stay I created a photography project which mirrors my mental experience of being away from home. Now it's done and I have a great opportunity to exhibit my work in my hometown Gothenburg. I have gathered the project in this book which combines the photographies and texts from the project. I have managed to find a way to print the works for the exhibition but I lack funds for the printing of the book. I'm printing 50 copies.</strong></p>
<p>From the beginning the book was only supposed to be something that would make my work more real when I'm looking for places to exhibit. I would go to the place and show the the book and say that this is what I want to exhibit. But then after finishing the book I decided that it was something that I wanted to share with more people and something I wanted people to be able to bring home. The book contains four parts, including 3D pictures and multiple exposures. Most of the photographs are taken in Bristol.</p>
<p>Below is what's written on the back of the book. It's written by my teacher Mark Curtis back in Bristol and describes the content of the project as well as me and my stay in Bristol. When I was done with the whole project I wanted Mark to write something about it because it felt weird to describe my own work and I was sure that he would write something good.</p>
<p>''Josef came to our course a few weeks into the term, having found his own way through conventional post 16 education into our progressive little course run at the Engine shed in Bristol. The course is developmental and designed to support the immersion of our small group in commercial creative practice at the heart of the Bristol Temple Meads Enterprize Zone. An area defined to attract inward investment in our city in the sectors of Creative, High tech and Digital industry. Walking into our world as a highly creative and digitally aware young man Josef instantly found kindred spirits among the students and staff alike. He is a creative force who manages to challenge and beguile all that he meets and I’m convinced he will continue to do so. I was personally intrigued by this young man who has travelled at 16 to experience another culture without the generational understanding of our very uniquely Bristolian community. I love Bristol but it is not without its 21st century challenges. It is ethnically diverse yet unintegrated, culturally rich yet not inclusive, affluent yet impoverished. It’s a collection of villages that calls itself a city. For all its challenges, I love my city and would not live anywhere else. How can a young man from Sweden navigate the sensibilities that I have a 50 year relationship with, and what would Bristol make of him. In truth Bristol loves a creative free spirit. We are after all the home of Banksy, Brunel and Massive Attack and Josef already exhibits many of their pioneering qualities but he also saw his experience through the anguish and pressure that only a teenage boy alone without the close support of his family could. Love, Family, Freedom and yet a tremendous sense of dispossession and belonging elsewhere. Josef’s work has a haunting quality that combines the common and primal nuances from both Bristol and his home city of Gothenburg. His observations speak to all of us that have made this city our home, I recognise in his work the distance I saw when I first made the decision to settle and the conflict of feeling at home yet away. This is a twenty first century narrative that many migrant communities face across the world in our challenging global political climate. The need to belong when you emotionally reside elsewhere.      <i> This is a visceral story played out in the mind of a wonderfully engaging young man lost, occasionally physically, but more often emotionally, in our city.''</i></p>
