We try very hard to be as inclusive as possible and welcome women from every country, culture, religion and creed, </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What’s with the secrecy? </h3><p><br/>The idea of a secret society has been with us since the dawn of time. We thought it was time for a universal, secret girls club. When we founded the Sisterhood we wanted to make it exciting and fun and so added the ""Secret"" part. A community that starts off with secret symbols, can make us feel that we're part of something bigger than ourselves. And whenever there is a secret, let’s face it, everyone wants in on it. And that our ultimate aim, to get as many women and girls as possible into the Secret Sisterhood, supporting, uplifting and empowering one another. You can read more on our home page.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Are you a charity? </h3><p><br/>No, we are not. We are a social enterprise set up to run like a modern business that competes with every other business in offering beautiful things to wear and in the future other products, services and events.   However, where we are different is in that we are a profit-for-purpose company. We distribute ninety percent of our profits to women's charities to help end gender inequality. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other companies give 5% or 10% of their profits to charity. How do you give away 90%? </h3><p>It is core to our beliefs that as a social enterprise for purpose, we must be making an effective difference in the world. As soon as possible.  The Secret Sisterhood was not set up to make profits, it was set up to make a difference to women, all over the world. The massive contribution we make to charities is not a marketing trick to get more customers, it's the purpose of the business.  </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is a Founding Sister?</h3><p>We believe that Secret Sisterhood is built by everyday women in their local communities. We hope to enlist an army of Founding Sisters in every city and town on earth to help us grow the movement, so we can make real change. In order for this to happen, we have allocated the title 'Founding Sisters' to any woman who shows that extra support, by purchasing our Founding Sister jewellery, T-Shirts or $100 ""Grow the Sisterhood"" package. By purchasing our Founding Sister premium items, you are helping Secret Sisterhood grow while also showing you are committing to our cause.</p><p>Once you become a Founding Sister, Jacquie Love, the founder,  will get in contact with you and will go through our opportunities of how you can help spread the message of Sisterhood in your local area. You will also get an exclusive invite to join the Founding Sister Facebook Group online. There you will be able to help shape the successful future of the Secret Sisterhood. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What are the Sisterhood T-Shirts made from?</h3><p>Quality is very important to us so we have made sure each T-Shirt is made with beautiful quality materials. Each T-Shirt is made with 100% Cotton. Our Sisterhood T-Shirt logo is also embroidered with black cotton thread. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">I have ordered something. What next? </h3><p>Our campaign will run for 14 days. Once this has been completed we will get our beautiful T-Shirts made for each of you. If everything goes to plan, this will take 30 days. Once we receive the T-Shirts, we send them straight to you in our gorgeous Secret Sisterhood packaging. You should expect to receive your package late December/ early January. Please be patient with us, as we are a small team and our production lead times may change slightly, which is out of our control. If there is a delay to your order, we will let you know right away. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">I have a pre-sale or post-sales question.</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How do I contact you? </h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">You can email us on <strong>hey@secretsisterhood.com</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How much is shipping? Do you do international shipping?</h3><p>We offer free international shipping for all orders. Yes, that's right- free shipping EVERYWHERE!</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Do you offer exchanges or refunds? </h3><p>For unopened and unused items, we are happy to accept exchanges and refunds. You’ll have to post them back to us (we’re sorry, but we cant cover that cost) and your refund will be issued once your goods have passed inspection. For refunds, your payment will be reversed. Should your returned items not pass inspection because they’ve clearly been worn, we'll wash them and donate them to a woman in need or you can pay for shipping back to you.  We are prepared to exchange sizes or colours etc. on the condition that you pay the shipping cost both ways. So please insure you choose carefully the first time.  For both refunds and exchanges, you will need to notify us within 14 days of receiving your order. </p></div>","Secret Sisterhood is a women's movement that aims to empower, uplift and inspire women.Secret Sisterhood is founded upon the belief that if women and girls can come together, from all around the world, no matter their colour or creed, they can make a significant difference to help end gender inequality.

Then learning about social enterprises - businesses that are created to solve social problems - they decided to start a profit-for-purpose business that created beautiful products, services and events for women.And decided to distribute ninety percent of all profits, the Secret Sisterhood makes to women's charities. This allows charities to do what they do best -  the really hard fieldwork, while we, the founders, do what we hopefully do best, the social media, design and business stuff, thus creating a sustainable, win-win-win business for all.  Founding Sisters We want other passionate supporters of women's unity and Sisterhood to join us.  Currently, we are offering the Title of Founding Sister of the Secret Sisterhood to anyone who contributes a net amount of over $100 to help spread the word and grow the Secret Sisterhood.We want to build the group up to a million women worldwide, so we can have Secret Sisterhood gatherings in every major city and town, offering our Sisterhood love and support almost everywhere. You could be our next town or city community leader. This can be done by contributing $100 to grow the Sisterhood,  by purchasing our Founding Sister Secret Necklace on our website, by buying one of the Limited Edition Founding Sister T-Shirts and / or Packages as offered in our campaign.The 2017 Founding Sister T-Shirts look like the first-release Secret Sisterhood T-shirts, but are limited to 100 in number and will have a Secret marking that will make them collectable and forever cherished.   You'll need to buy one to find out what the Secret marking is. As a Founding Sister, you will also be invited but not obligated to join our Founding Sister Facebook Group, to give your input to help envision the way forward for the Secret Sisterhood.    Any Other Questions? Check out our website: www.SecretSisterhood.com

We try very hard to be as inclusive as possible and welcome women from every country, culture, religion and creed,  What’s with the secrecy? The idea of a secret society has been with us since the dawn of time. We thought it was time for a universal, secret girls club. When we founded the Sisterhood we wanted to make it exciting and fun and so added the ""Secret"" part. A community that starts off with secret symbols, can make us feel that we're part of something bigger than ourselves. And whenever there is a secret, let’s face it, everyone wants in on it. And that our ultimate aim, to get as many women and girls as possible into the Secret Sisterhood, supporting, uplifting and empowering one another. You can read more on our home page. Are you a charity? No, we are not. We are a social enterprise set up to run like a modern business that competes with every other business in offering beautiful things to wear and in the future other products, services and events.   However, where we are different is in that we are a profit-for-purpose company. We distribute ninety percent of our profits to women's charities to help end gender inequality.  Other companies give 5% or 10% of their profits to charity. How do you give away 90%? It is core to our beliefs that as a social enterprise for purpose, we must be making an effective difference in the world. As soon as possible.  The Secret Sisterhood was not set up to make profits, it was set up to make a difference to women, all over the world. The massive contribution we make to charities is not a marketing trick to get more customers, it's the purpose of the business.   What is a Founding Sister?We believe that Secret Sisterhood is built by everyday women in their local communities. We hope to enlist an army of Founding Sisters in every city and town on earth to help us grow the movement, so we can make real change. In order for this to happen, we have allocated the title 'Founding Sisters' to any woman who shows that extra support, by purchasing our Founding Sister jewellery, T-Shirts or $100 ""Grow the Sisterhood"" package. By purchasing our Founding Sister premium items, you are helping Secret Sisterhood grow while also showing you are committing to our cause.Once you become a Founding Sister, Jacquie Love, the founder,  will get in contact with you and will go through our opportunities of how you can help spread the message of Sisterhood in your local area. You will also get an exclusive invite to join the Founding Sister Facebook Group online. There you will be able to help shape the successful future of the Secret Sisterhood.  What are the Sisterhood T-Shirts made from?Quality is very important to us so we have made sure each T-Shirt is made with beautiful quality materials. Each T-Shirt is made with 100% Cotton. Our Sisterhood T-Shirt logo is also embroidered with black cotton thread.  I have ordered something. What next? Our campaign will run for 14 days. Once this has been completed we will get our beautiful T-Shirts made for each of you. If everything goes to plan, this will take 30 days. Once we receive the T-Shirts, we send them straight to you in our gorgeous Secret Sisterhood packaging. You should expect to receive your package late December/ early January. Please be patient with us, as we are a small team and our production lead times may change slightly, which is out of our control. If there is a delay to your order, we will let you know right away.  I have a pre-sale or post-sales question.How do I contact you? You can email us on hey@secretsisterhood.com How much is shipping? Do you do international shipping?We offer free international shipping for all orders. Yes, that's right- free shipping EVERYWHERE! Do you offer exchanges or refunds? For unopened and unused items, we are happy to accept exchanges and refunds. You’ll have to post them back to us (we’re sorry, but we cant cover that cost) and your refund will be issued once your goods have passed inspection. For refunds, your payment will be reversed. Should your returned items not pass inspection because they’ve clearly been worn, we'll wash them and donate them to a woman in need or you can pay for shipping back to you.  We are prepared to exchange sizes or colours etc. on the condition that you pay the shipping cost both ways. So please insure you choose carefully the first time.  For both refunds and exchanges, you will need to notify us within 14 days of receiving your order.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>November 2016 was the start of a difficult journey for the United States.</p>
<p>Donald J. Trump was elected as President and has since divided our nation with ignorance and stupidity. Unfortunately, he is supported by a largely Republican Congress and as such, we feel it's our duty to wish them a happy holiday season.</p>
<p>We will order 540 greeting cards from a small, female run business out of Colorado, as pictured. We will address, stamp, and inscribe each one to the members of Congress, our vile Vice President, and our increasingly abhorrent President himself. Each holiday card will have a message calling for his impeachment and expressing distaste for what feels like a never ending transgression against women, LGBTQIA, people of color, and those that identify as all of the above.</p>
<p>The break down of the $2000 is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of the cards is quoted as a little over $1600 including shipping</li>
<li>The cost of postage is ballparked at $180</li>
<li>The extra amount is to calculate for the fee Indiegogo charges to use the platform<ul><li>5% overall plus 3% + $0.30 of every credit card based donation</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event the public addresses for the state offices are incorrect, we will put the White House down as the return address so that one way or another the message is received.</p>
<p>For every $2000 raised past the goal, we will order a second batch of cards to send to CEOs of companies that support the Trump administration. Amounts past that will turn our attention to news stations in large cities. In the odd event, we raise MORE than that, well....there's other holidays in which to send greeting cards objecting to whatever new policy that is being pushed through legislation.</p>
<p>In the event we don't reach our goal, we will personally make up the difference, in addition to covering any other out of pocket expenses that may come up (pens? tape? a caffeinated beverage?). Any amount that remains after the supplies are ordered, if any, will be paid to the small business providing the cards as a thank you.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For the past 10 years, the Muslim Jewish Conference has gathered more than 1.000 young change-makers - from over 65 countries -  to engage in dialogue and together, create innovative networks of Muslim-Jewish cooperation. Through annual, week-long conferences that provide a safe space for participants to break down barriers and restore trust, the MJC has managed to become a grassroots leader in the field of interfaith dialogue. However, our ability to keep working independently depends on the necessary resources to establish a sustainable and professionally run organization.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574272772/vt2xnaclpmgzhenxhj6t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we do it</h3>
<p>Intercultural and interreligious relations worldwide have become increasingly tense over the past several years. Relationships between Muslims and Jews have particularly suffered. Nonetheless, given the right space and time, we know and have proven over the years that citizens can and will engage across different identities constructively and with an open mind, if given the chance to do so.</p>
<p>In 2007, Ilja Sichrovsky participated in a Model United Nations conference. There, in Geneva, he stumbled upon a new life path. A Muslim member of the Pakistani delegation asked if he was a Jew, telling him that he was the first Jew he had met. Sichrovsky recalled, “We were open minded and well-read, but quickly realized <strong>we knew nothing about each other</strong>. After determining that we posed no threat to one another, we spent time listening to each other.” Following the encounter, Sichrovsky convened like-minded peers to start changing the state of international Jewish-Muslim relations. He founded the Muslim Jewish Conference in 2009 (MJC) to change the pattern of Muslim-Jewish ignorance, mistrust, and hate, and instead repair and turn this relationship into a model for collaboration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574273247/dehsxdgmahwkxqtp1tak.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How far we have come</h3>
<p>Over the last decade, the Muslim Jewish Conference has gathered <strong>more than 1.000 young changemakers from more than 65 countries</strong>. The MJC team has provoked meaningful communication on relevant topics including: religious teachings, confronting stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice, minority-majority relations, Anti-Muslim Racism and Antisemitism, inter-faith and intra-faith relations, gender relations, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, arts and culture, genocide awareness, and many more. We are proud to have provoked discussions and interactions of the highest quality as well as incubated some of the most original and impactful interfaith projects.</p>
<p>The MJC also managed to create an ecosystem of interfaith actors to learn from each other and build effective coalitions. With a decade of experience based on a network of deeply committed international volunteers, and despite a very limited budget from 2010-2019 which strictly allowed us to organize one conference per year, the Muslim Jewish Conference has become a trusted partner and a reference in the field of citizen and interfaith dialogue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574273447/kwphrd5xnnb34aaq2wob.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How far we can go</h3>
<p>The mission cannot limit itself to annual conferences, be they of unmatched quality and depth. We have to multiply and sustain Muslim Jewish engagement in order to bridge the two communities and counter the divisive and confrontational discourse everywhere around the globe. We must therefore set up a sustainable movement which not only convenes regular conferences but also supports multiple local chapters as well as high quality alumni initiatives on Muslim – Jewish dialogue and collaboration. </p>
<p>In December 2019, the MJC will host its <strong>10th annual conference</strong> in Vienna with a specific purpose: to gather the main actors of this movement to reflect on how far we have come and how far we can go together. The objective is to set up the stage for another successful 10 years with a consolidated team, vision, and resources to transform our work from a grassroots initiative into a professionally guided structure.</p>
<p>In 2020, we want to transform the Muslim Jewish Conference into the <strong>Muslim Jewish Alliance</strong> (MJA). To be based in Germany, MJA will be run on the principles set forth by the actors of the 10 annual conferences and the many volunteers who made it possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574339325/ip8a3aquxnl0k9dlizr6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help</h3>
<p>This is where you come in! Run exclusively by volunteers, and having stayed fiercely independent, the MJC has not received the necessary financial support to sustainably professionalize its operations.</p>
<p><u><strong>Goal : € 30, 000</strong></u></p>
<p>Achieving this fundraising goal will allow us to execute a transformational 10th Annual Muslim Jewish Conference. For many of our attendees, this will be their first time out of their home country, and in so many cases, it will be their first engagement with ""the other"". Our aim has always been to be inclusive - to break down walls of access to dialogue, and to cross beyond socio-economic and political barriers. Your help will make it possible to require no costs for nor participation fees from our attendees.  This permits greater demographic diversity, and allows us to support more participants in their journey to the conference.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally, your donation will help us to fund :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Accommodations for 50 participants and 10 volunteers in Austria for the 10th MJC</li>
<li>Kosher and Halal food for all participants and volunteers for the 10th MJC</li>
<li>Airfare for volunteers as well as participants in need of financial support</li>
<li>Professional conference and workshop materials</li>
</ol>
<p>The money raised does more than just help us organize our 10th Annual Conference. Both during the conference and afterward, you help us to create a safer space for our participants to engage in community and coalition building, creating lasting bonds, and to forge activist platforms for our alumni where they can work to make dreams reality.</p>
<p><strong>Any excess funds</strong> raised above our initial goal will go directly into the efforts to organize the 11th Muslim Jewish Conference, as well as seedfund the most innovative alumni projects in our network.</p>
<p><strong>Any additional funds</strong> would be used to establish a professional working structure for the envisioned Muslim Jewish Alliance, which aims to ensure a more broad-reaching and permanent effort in rebuilding and strengthening Muslim-Jewish relations worldwide. </p>
<p><strong>In summary</strong>, we are asking YOU to help us build a future where Muslim-Jewish collaboration becomes the norm instead of a distant dream.  Any donation will have an impact!</p>

For the past 10 years, the Muslim Jewish Conference has gathered more than 1.000 young change-makers - from over 65 countries -  to engage in dialogue and together, create innovative networks of Muslim-Jewish cooperation. Through annual, week-long conferences that provide a safe space for participants to break down barriers and restore trust, the MJC has managed to become a grassroots leader in the field of interfaith dialogue. However, our ability to keep working independently depends on the necessary resources to establish a sustainable and professionally run organization.
 


Why we do it
Intercultural and interreligious relations worldwide have become increasingly tense over the past several years. Relationships between Muslims and Jews have particularly suffered. Nonetheless, given the right space and time, we know and have proven over the years that citizens can and will engage across different identities constructively and with an open mind, if given the chance to do so.
In 2007, Ilja Sichrovsky participated in a Model United Nations conference. There, in Geneva, he stumbled upon a new life path. A Muslim member of the Pakistani delegation asked if he was a Jew, telling him that he was the first Jew he had met. Sichrovsky recalled, “We were open minded and well-read, but quickly realized we knew nothing about each other. After determining that we posed no threat to one another, we spent time listening to each other.” Following the encounter, Sichrovsky convened like-minded peers to start changing the state of international Jewish-Muslim relations. He founded the Muslim Jewish Conference in 2009 (MJC) to change the pattern of Muslim-Jewish ignorance, mistrust, and hate, and instead repair and turn this relationship into a model for collaboration.
 


How far we have come
Over the last decade, the Muslim Jewish Conference has gathered more than 1.000 young changemakers from more than 65 countries. The MJC team has provoked meaningful communication on relevant topics including: religious teachings, confronting stereotypes, discrimination and prejudice, minority-majority relations, Anti-Muslim Racism and Antisemitism, inter-faith and intra-faith relations, gender relations, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, arts and culture, genocide awareness, and many more. We are proud to have provoked discussions and interactions of the highest quality as well as incubated some of the most original and impactful interfaith projects.
The MJC also managed to create an ecosystem of interfaith actors to learn from each other and build effective coalitions. With a decade of experience based on a network of deeply committed international volunteers, and despite a very limited budget from 2010-2019 which strictly allowed us to organize one conference per year, the Muslim Jewish Conference has become a trusted partner and a reference in the field of citizen and interfaith dialogue.
 


How far we can go
The mission cannot limit itself to annual conferences, be they of unmatched quality and depth. We have to multiply and sustain Muslim Jewish engagement in order to bridge the two communities and counter the divisive and confrontational discourse everywhere around the globe. We must therefore set up a sustainable movement which not only convenes regular conferences but also supports multiple local chapters as well as high quality alumni initiatives on Muslim – Jewish dialogue and collaboration. 
In December 2019, the MJC will host its 10th annual conference in Vienna with a specific purpose: to gather the main actors of this movement to reflect on how far we have come and how far we can go together. The objective is to set up the stage for another successful 10 years with a consolidated team, vision, and resources to transform our work from a grassroots initiative into a professionally guided structure.
In 2020, we want to transform the Muslim Jewish Conference into the Muslim Jewish Alliance (MJA). To be based in Germany, MJA will be run on the principles set forth by the actors of the 10 annual conferences and the many volunteers who made it possible.
 


We need your help
This is where you come in! Run exclusively by volunteers, and having stayed fiercely independent, the MJC has not received the necessary financial support to sustainably professionalize its operations.
Goal : € 30, 000
Achieving this fundraising goal will allow us to execute a transformational 10th Annual Muslim Jewish Conference. For many of our attendees, this will be their first time out of their home country, and in so many cases, it will be their first engagement with ""the other"". Our aim has always been to be inclusive - to break down walls of access to dialogue, and to cross beyond socio-economic and political barriers. Your help will make it possible to require no costs for nor participation fees from our attendees.  This permits greater demographic diversity, and allows us to support more participants in their journey to the conference.
Additionally, your donation will help us to fund :

Accommodations for 50 participants and 10 volunteers in Austria for the 10th MJC
Kosher and Halal food for all participants and volunteers for the 10th MJC
Airfare for volunteers as well as participants in need of financial support
Professional conference and workshop materials

The money raised does more than just help us organize our 10th Annual Conference. Both during the conference and afterward, you help us to create a safer space for our participants to engage in community and coalition building, creating lasting bonds, and to forge activist platforms for our alumni where they can work to make dreams reality.
Any excess funds raised above our initial goal will go directly into the efforts to organize the 11th Muslim Jewish Conference, as well as seedfund the most innovative alumni projects in our network.
Any additional funds would be used to establish a professional working structure for the envisioned Muslim Jewish Alliance, which aims to ensure a more broad-reaching and permanent effort in rebuilding and strengthening Muslim-Jewish relations worldwide. 
In summary, we are asking YOU to help us build a future where Muslim-Jewish collaboration becomes the norm instead of a distant dream.  Any donation will have an impact!

Help us deliver the best ready-to-install personal climbing wall for your kids and get their feet off the ground.   
Other Ways You Can Help Help us spread the word.  If you are a climber and think that this project can help increase the awareness of the sport and bring in better climbers by stating them off young, spread the word now!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

building walls. We erect walls amid genders, social classes, racial and
religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. We put up walls instead of building
bridges to end discrimination shoulder to shoulder.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">The Hungarian government decreed that a barbed wire
fence, which is 175 km long and 3 m high, must be erected on the border between
Hungary and Serbia, blocking the refugees’ way and their last chance to live under
human conditions. The fence will be equipped with NATO-wire; its blades will
cause serious injuries to the refugees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">It should not be forgotten that only some of the
refugees are so fortunate to be able to flee their war-torn native country. As
so often happens, family members sacrifice everything since they sell all of
their properties to get enough money so that at least one person can escape the
hell they are forced to live in. It is they who arrive to a country believed to
be safe after their months-long escape and it is they who will have to face a
border enclosed with barbed wire fence.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">Asylum seekers have the right to be treated as humans
as well as to receive refugee status within the framework of legal and fair
procedure. This chance should be given to every human being. Indigent refugees
are deprived of this chance by building the fences.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">Building the fences will be likely to cost as much as
eleven years’ asylum budget of Hungary. Building them is a wrong-headed
decision. Erecting walls, beyond its symbolical meaning, can never be a
solution to any problem.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify; color: #000000;"">It has been proved throughout history that walls
encouraging isolation are senseless, and have demanded a lot of needless
sacrifices indirectly; however, they have always been demolished.</p>

</div></div>","Hungarian translation available: Magyar fordítás az angol szöveg után! A videó rendelkezik magyar felirattal (cc gomb lenyomásával aktiválható).The main objective of this campaign is to show the
world that we are committed to fighting against exclusion and detention.  We aim to draw attention to the rights and the
desperate plight of the refugees and asylum seekers as well as to the tragic
situation arisen from world politics, which concerns thousands of people even
today. We would like to help the refugees staying in our country to find their
feet in this part of the world far away from their homes.
One has to accept the fact that the
refugees arriving in Hungary left their homes with good cause. They should be
treated with respect since they would not join any organizations that intend to
take other’s lives. They are not criminals but victims and their escape serves to
end violence in the world.
„From Hungary to Egypt, endless regulations and overt intimidation increasingly target civil society. And around the world, brave men and women who dare raise their voices are harassed and attacked and even killed.” Barack ObamaShort-term goals:
The amount flowing from the campaign will be spent on the basic essentials such as food, water, duvet, blanket, pillow,clothes, diaper, baby carriage, shoes, slippers, painkiller, antipyretic,
antibiotics, bandage, wheelchair, and crutch.Long-term goals:
-to make more and more people join
us. 
-to point out the refugee’s vital
role, since multiculturalism is inherent in the world’s most successful
countries. 
-to draw attention to the desperate plight of the
refugees as well as their  inalienable
rights.
-to organize programmes which are
supposed to facilitate integration.
-to provide basic health-care
services for refugee children.









The Hungarian government is doing its best
to stir up intense hatred towards the refugees. Accordingly, the Hungarian
government has placed manipulative, ambiguous placards all over the country in
favour of the refugees’ negative judgement.


The government is planning to make
considerable modifications in the law to make the life of the refugees fleeing
from persecution to Hungary impossible.

The government does not distinguish
between refugees and bracket together those fleeing from persecution, war or
violence with those immigrating to Hungary due to economic reasons.


A female student from Szeged has been
badly beaten up due to the fact that bald men dressed in black picked a fight
with a Hungarian man of mixed race who was thought to be an immigrant. The
girlfriend of the mixed-race boy tried to intervene, the attackers did not care
about it, and therefore the young girl was also slapped several times across the
face. The attackers ran away afterwards. By the way, the biracial boy was born
in Hungary; accordingly he is a Hungarian national.

Tímea’s cheekbone broke; there are huge
bruises over both of her eyes; her mouth cracked; the wound needed several
stitches; some of her teeth nearly fell out. Her broken cheekbone was finally put
together. She posted a message on Facebook a few hours before the operation: 
“I’m going to recover.”


As was seen above, a girl can be beaten up
for no reason in today’s Hungary just because her boyfriend’s complexion is not
“purely” white. In addition, a gay activist has also been maltreated. Andrea
Giuliano, guy activist from Hungary, has been attacked by unknown offenders;
his cheek has been smashed without explanation. He has already received several
death threats in connection with his work.  
The victim posted a message on his Facebook
page upon the attack: “Help! Somebody’s punched
me on the nose; my cheek’s been completely smashed!”





We, humans have always been good at
building walls. We erect walls amid genders, social classes, racial and
religious beliefs, and sexual orientation. We put up walls instead of building
bridges to end discrimination shoulder to shoulder.
The Hungarian government decreed that a barbed wire
fence, which is 175 km long and 3 m high, must be erected on the border between
Hungary and Serbia, blocking the refugees’ way and their last chance to live under
human conditions. The fence will be equipped with NATO-wire; its blades will
cause serious injuries to the refugees.
It should not be forgotten that only some of the
refugees are so fortunate to be able to flee their war-torn native country. As
so often happens, family members sacrifice everything since they sell all of
their properties to get enough money so that at least one person can escape the
hell they are forced to live in. It is they who arrive to a country believed to
be safe after their months-long escape and it is they who will have to face a
border enclosed with barbed wire fence.
Asylum seekers have the right to be treated as humans
as well as to receive refugee status within the framework of legal and fair
procedure. This chance should be given to every human being. Indigent refugees
are deprived of this chance by building the fences.
Building the fences will be likely to cost as much as
eleven years’ asylum budget of Hungary. Building them is a wrong-headed
decision. Erecting walls, beyond its symbolical meaning, can never be a
solution to any problem.
It has been proved throughout history that walls
encouraging isolation are senseless, and have demanded a lot of needless
sacrifices indirectly; however, they have always been demolished.

Zeid Raad al-Husszein declared in front of the UN’s Human Rights Council: “I feel distressed and ashamed of the refugees’ frequent demonization, which is noticeable in several countries whose residents live a peaceful, prosperous and carefree life.”
“Migrants are human beings with the same human rights as we have here. They are not criminals.”




Hungarians throughout history had to flee many times
as well. We received help from other countries at the time, which we tend to
forget about.
We thank all the nations of the world for taking both
our Jewish and non-Jewish compatriots being forced to flee Hungary at the time
of the Second World War.
We thank all the nations of the world for taking our
refugees during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, who fled from the Soviet
terror and repression in the hope of a better life.
We should be grateful to the countries having taken
our refugees.

Kampányunk célja, hogy megmutassuk a
világnak, hogy küzdünk a kirekesztés és a fogvatartás ellen! Célunk felhívni a
figyelmet a menekültek és menedékkérők jogaira, a menekültek hátrányos
helyzetére és a világpolitikának köszönhetően kialakult tragikus helyzetre,
mely több millió embert érint napjainkban is. Segíteni szeretnénk a hazánkban élő migránsokat abban, hogy megtalálják
helyüket hazájuktól távol a világnak ezen a részén.
El kell fogadnunk, hogy a Magyarországra érkező menekültek alapos okkal
hagyták el országukat, tiszteletet érdemelnek azért, mert nem voltak hajlandók olyan szervezetekhez csatlakozni, mely mások életére tőr. Ők nem bűnözők,
hanem áldozatok és menekülésükkel azt a célt szolgálják, hogy a világon
megszűnjön az erőszak.
„Magyarországtól Egyiptomig vég nélküli szabályozások és nyílt megfélemlítések érik egyre inkább a civil társadalmat. És a világ körül olyan bátor férfiakat és nőket zaklatnak, támadnak, sőt gyilkolnak meg, akik hallatni merik a hangjukat”Barack Obama
Mire
van szükségünk? Mire fordítjuk a támogatást?


Rövidtávú
céljaink:
A
kampányból befolyó támogatásból elsősorban a legfontosabb tárgyi eszközöket
szeretnénk biztosítani: élelmiszer, ásványvíz, paplan, takaró, párna, ruhanemű,
pelenka, babakocsi, cipő, papucs, fájdalomcsillapító, lázcsillapító,
antibiotikum, kötszer, kerekesszék, mankó
Hosszútávú céljaink:
-szeretnénk, hogy
minél többen csatlakozzanak hozzánk
-rámutatni a
menekültek értékteremtő szerepére, hiszen a világ legsikeresebb országaira
jellemző a multikulturalizmus
-felhívni a figyelmet
a menekültek hátrányos helyzetére és jogaira

-kampányok
szervezése a menekültek fogvatartása ellen
-integrációs programok szervezése a menekültek számára
-a menekült gyermekek számára megfelelő ellátás biztosítása


A magyar kormány intézkedései





A magyar kormány mindent megtesz annak
érdekében, hogy az emberekben gyűlöletet keltsen a menekültek iránt. Ennek
érdekében a magyar kormány az egész ország területén manipulatív, kétértelmű
plakátokat helyezett el a menekültek negatív megítélése érdekében.

A kormány olyan törvénymódosításokat
tervez, melyek a legelesettebbeket veszik célba és ellehetetlenítik olyan
menekültek életét, akik valamely üldöztetés elől menekültek Magyarországra. 
A kormány jelen állás szerint nem
válogat menekült és menekült között és összemossa a kényszer, üldöztetés,
háború és erőszak elől menekülőket a csak és kizárólag gazdasági okokból
migráló emberekkel.
Mi lett az eredménye a kormány
kampányának?
Egy szegedi egyetemista lányt megvertek. Az
eset úgy történt, hogy fekete ruhás kopasz férfiak belekötöttek egy félvér
magyar férfibe, mert azt hitték, hogy bevándorló. A félvér fiú barátnője
próbált közbelépni, ami nem érdekelte a támadókat, ezért a fiatal lány kapta a
pofonok nagyját, ezután a támadók elfutottak. A
félvér fiú egyébként Magyarországon született és magyar állampolgár.

Tímea arccsontja eltört, mindkét szeme alatt
zúzódások vannak, szája felrepedt, a sebet több öltéssel kellett összevarrni,
kis híján több foga is kiesett. Tímea törött arccsontjait végül sikerült
összeilleszteni. A műtét előtt pár órával a Facebookon azt üzente az érte
aggódóknak:
„Meggyógyulok!”
Erősödő szélsőségek a melegeket sem
kímélik
Amint azt fent láthattuk ma
Magyarországon minden ok nélkül megvernek egy lányt csak azért mert a barátja
bőrének színe nem „tisztán” fehér. Ezt követően egy melegjogi aktivistát is
bántalmazás ért. Andrea Giuliano, Magyarországon
élő olasz melegjogi aktivistát ismeretlenek támadták meg, arcát összetörték,
melynek okát nem indokolták. Munkájával összefüggésben több halálos fenyegetést
is kapott már.
Az
áldozat a támadást követően írt facebook oldalára: „Segítség!
Valaki orrba csapott, teljesen összetört az arcom!” 
Miért emelünk falakat az emberek közé?


Mi emberek mindig is erősek voltunk
a falak építésében. Falakat emelünk a nemek-, társadalmi rétegek-, fajok-,
vallási meggyőződések-, szexuális beállítottság között.
Falakat emelünk ahelyett,
hogy hidakat építenénk és együttes 
erővel győznénk le a megkülönböztetést. 
A magyar kormány arról
határozott, hogy egy 175 km hosszú szögesdróttal ellátott 3 méter magas kerítést
emel a magyar-szerb határon lezárva ezzel a menekültek útját és utolsó
lehetőségét arra, hogy normális életkörülmények között élhessenek. A kerítés
teljes terjedelmében NATO-dróttal lesz felszerelve, pengéi jelentős sérüléseket
okoznak majd a menekülteknek.
Ne felejtsük a menekültek egy része van olyan
szerencsés, hogy el tud menekülni háborúval sújtotta származási országából,
gyakran úgy, hogy a családtagok az életüket áldozzák értük, mert eladják az
összes megmaradt ingóságukat, hogy annyi pénzhez jussanak, hogy legalább egy
ember el tudjon jönni abból a pokolból amiben élni kényszerülnek. Ők érkeznek
el hónapokig tartó menekülés után egy biztonságosnak hitt országba és ő előttük
zárja most le ezzel a kerítéssel a kormány a határt.
A menedékkérőknek joguk van
ahhoz, hogy emberként bánjanak velük és ahhoz, hogy egy törvényes és
tisztességes eljárás keretében kapjanak menekült státuszt. Ezt a lehetőséget
minden embernek meg kell adni. A kerítés a rászoruló menekültektől ezt a lehetőséget elveszi. 
A kerítés építése várhatóan
annyiba fog kerülni, mint Magyarország 11 évi menekültügyi költségvetése. A kerítés
megépítése elhibázott döntés! A falak emelése túl azok szimbolikus jelentésén
nem megoldás. A történelem során tapasztaltuk, hogy az elszigetelődést
elősegítő falak értelmetlennek bizonyultak és közvetve rengeteg felesleges
áldozattal jártak, de végül mind leomlottak.
Mit mond az ENSZ?
Zeid Raad al-Husszein az ENSZ Emberi Jogi Tanácsa előtt akként nyilatkozott, hogy „lesújt és szégyennel tölt el a menekültek gyakori démonizálása, amely számos olyan országban megfigyelhető, amelyek lakosai békében, jólétben és gondtalanságban élnek”
“A migránsok emberek, ugyanolyan emberi jogokkal, mint ami itt nekünk van. Ők nem bűnözők.”

Köszönjük a világnak!
A történelem során mi magyarok is
többször kénytelenek voltunk menekülni… akkor segítséget kaptunk más
országoktól, ezt mára azonban elfelejtettük.
Köszönjük a világ minden nemzetének,

<p><strong>EN:</strong><br/>Baltic Pride is anannual festival and parade that brings together LGBT+ community and supporters in one of the Baltic capitals – Tallinn, Riga or Vilnius. The parade that will take place in Latvia on June 9th  is very important to us as  organization, because we want to be loud and proud about equality, to have opportunity to express our opinion and to get more people involved in solution of equality questions. So far the LGBT+ rights situation in the Baltics is far from great due to the low engagement of the LGBT community and broader society of our countries.<br/><br/>We believe in value that Baltic Pride brings, therefore we participate in support to the idea of the event and in order to show that Lithuanians who care about equal rights to LGBT+ community stand together with others from Baltic countries.<br/><br/>Workshops to prepare for the parade will be held in Vilnius and Šiauliai. The financial support is needed for materials for poster making, LGBT+ flags and so on. Also money will be spent to cover expences of the trip (renting a bus with driver and fuel)<br/><br/>Financial support will give opportunity for youth from different towns of Lithuania to safely get to the Pride march and to represent their believes.<br/><br/><br/><strong>LT:</strong><br/>Baltic Pride – tai kasmetinis festivalis ir eitynės, suburiančios LGBT+ asmenis ir juos palaikančius paeiliui vienoje iš Baltijos valstybių sostinių – Taline, Rygoje arba Vilniuje.

</div></div>","EN:Baltic Pride is anannual festival and parade that brings together LGBT+ community and supporters in one of the Baltic capitals – Tallinn, Riga or Vilnius. The parade that will take place in Latvia on June 9th  is very important to us as  organization, because we want to be loud and proud about equality, to have opportunity to express our opinion and to get more people involved in solution of equality questions. So far the LGBT+ rights situation in the Baltics is far from great due to the low engagement of the LGBT community and broader society of our countries.We believe in value that Baltic Pride brings, therefore we participate in support to the idea of the event and in order to show that Lithuanians who care about equal rights to LGBT+ community stand together with others from Baltic countries.Workshops to prepare for the parade will be held in Vilnius and Šiauliai. The financial support is needed for materials for poster making, LGBT+ flags and so on. Also money will be spent to cover expences of the trip (renting a bus with driver and fuel)Financial support will give opportunity for youth from different towns of Lithuania to safely get to the Pride march and to represent their believes.LT:Baltic Pride – tai kasmetinis festivalis ir eitynės, suburiančios LGBT+ asmenis ir juos palaikančius paeiliui vienoje iš Baltijos valstybių sostinių – Taline, Rygoje arba Vilniuje. Eitynės, 2018 metais vyksiančios Latvijoje, birželio 9 dieną, mums kaip organizacijai yra labai svarbios, nes norime būti matomesni, atsiranda galimybė išsakyti savo nuomonę, siekti būti lygiomis teisėmis pripažintais bei tikėtis, kad problemos nelygybės klausimais būtų sprendžiamos. Iki šiol LGBT+ teisių situacija Baltijos šalyse yra prasčiausia ir dėl mažo LGBT bendruomenės ir visuomenės įsitraukimo.Mes tikime eitynių nauda ir dalyvaujame, nes svarbu palaikyti eitynių idėją, o kartu parodyti, kad Lietuvos gyventojai, palaikantys lygias teises LGBT+ žmonėms, prisideda prie Baltijos šalių bendruomenės.Vilniuje bei Šiauliuose vyks dirbtuvės (t.y. pasirengimas eitynėms). Joms reikalinga parama bus naudojama medžiagoms plakatams, triukšmo atributikai, LGBT+ vėliavoms. Taip pat  lėšos bus skirtos kelionei (t.y. autobuso su vairuotoju nuomai ir kurui).Parama suteiktų galimybę jaunimui, atstovaujančiam kelis Lietuvos miestus, kuris ne visada turi galimybę savarankiškai, saugiai, su atsakinga bendruomene vykti į renginį ir patirti eitynių džiaugsmą.Tolerant Youth Association/ Tolerantiško jaunimo asociacija:

<h1>Queer Rock Camp </h1> <p>Queer Rock Camp is a weeklong music camp for queer, gender variant, gender non-conforming and allied youth (ages 12-21) base<span>d in Olympia, Washington. Youth and volunteers come from all over the Puget Sound area, West Coast, and beyond. Campers learn an instrument, form a band, write an original song, and their hard work culminates in a public showcase. Throughout the week, youth participate in workshops focusing on community building, social justice, self-empowerment, and musical techniques.

<p><span>Queer Rock Camp was founded in 2011 with 33 campers from around the Pacific Northwest, and subsequent years have brought continual growth, challenges, and exciting changes! This previous summer we served approximately 50 campers from around the US, and volunteers have come from all over the world to be part of camp. We are a currently a program of Stonewall Youth in Olympia, and are working towards getting independent non-profit status. As one of the first and only music camps for queer youth -- QRC has become a model for a new and exciting form of music programing. </span></p>
<h3><i><br/></i></h3>
<h3><i>We're Expanding!</i></h3>
<p>Last year we were flooded with camper applications, and we are so excited to host a brand new session of camp in Seattle to serve a greater number of youth! Seattle has a real lack of queer youth focused programming and we are so excited to bring QRC to the city! Seattle is substantially more expensive in terms of renting space, and transportation. We need our community's help to get us set up in the big city. We plan on using this money to seed our initial camp while we establish ourselves in Seattle and move towards utilizing sustainable sources of funding.  <br/></p>

<p>The impact of camp is immense. Queer Rock Camp has created a ripple effect in the lives of many campers and volunteers, with folks going on to empower their own communities with the skills and confidence gained at camp.

<p>Camp has been immensely successful, doubling in size since its first incarnation in 2011. As we expand into Seattle, we are excited to continue to inspire a whole generation of young queer musicians in the North West. </p>

In fact, users do not even need a bank account. This dramatically cuts burdensome costs for the borrowers and empowers them to regain control over their finances. P2P loans give borrowers access to financing that they may not have otherwise gotten approval for by standard financial intermediaries.</p><p>For some people, specifically in underprivileged countries or communities, a mere $24 loan from WalletBoss to consolidate loans or pay off high interest “shark” or other loans could make a huge difference and put them back on the right financial track.</p><p>In order to jumpstart the model on a global scale and validate this powerful concept, WalletBoss needs people like you to help us launch this important social project.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>By donating as little as the cost of 1 cup of coffee you can be part of something that may actually change a family’s life. You become part of a community that cares.</strong></p><p>Just to make sure: your money is not an actual donation but becomes part of your digital wallet. You can then use this money to grant loans, which are subsequently paid back to your wallet in weekly payments. As you know, a small amount for you in the western world goes a long way in underdeveloped countries.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A SHORT SUMMARY</h3><p>One of the most common problems for underprivileged populations is the “shark loan” phenomenon. “Shark loans” are loans with disproportionately high weekly interest rates of a minimum 6%, and up to an incredible 15% a week. “Shark loaners” exploit people who often resort to these loans in desperate financial situations, either to keep a roof over their heads, or keep their small businesses afloat. The skyrocketing interest rates result in borrowers being unable to repay their debts, which spin out of control over a short period of time. This leads to a financial whirlpool, and families become entrenched deeper and deeper into the cycle of debt and poverty without any escape routes, at times being exposed to extreme violence, when unable to repay.</p><h3>Here is how YOU can make a difference.</h3><p>Our vision at WalletBoss is to create communities composed of socially conscious people willing to help those in need, bringing together investors with potential borrowers, providing a convenient worldwide on-line platform, with the opportunity to grant and take and moral loans.</p><p>In order to jumpstart the model on a global scale and validate the concept, WalletBoss needs people like you to help us launch this amazing project.

In fact, users do not even need a bank account. This dramatically cuts burdensome costs for the borrowers and empowers them to regain control over their finances. P2P loans give borrowers access to financing that they may not have otherwise gotten approval for by standard financial intermediaries.For some people, specifically in underprivileged countries or communities, a mere $24 loan from WalletBoss to consolidate loans or pay off high interest “shark” or other loans could make a huge difference and put them back on the right financial track.In order to jumpstart the model on a global scale and validate this powerful concept, WalletBoss needs people like you to help us launch this important social project.By donating as little as the cost of 1 cup of coffee you can be part of something that may actually change a family’s life. You become part of a community that cares.Just to make sure: your money is not an actual donation but becomes part of your digital wallet. You can then use this money to grant loans, which are subsequently paid back to your wallet in weekly payments. As you know, a small amount for you in the western world goes a long way in underdeveloped countries.A SHORT SUMMARYOne of the most common problems for underprivileged populations is the “shark loan” phenomenon. “Shark loans” are loans with disproportionately high weekly interest rates of a minimum 6%, and up to an incredible 15% a week. “Shark loaners” exploit people who often resort to these loans in desperate financial situations, either to keep a roof over their heads, or keep their small businesses afloat. The skyrocketing interest rates result in borrowers being unable to repay their debts, which spin out of control over a short period of time. This leads to a financial whirlpool, and families become entrenched deeper and deeper into the cycle of debt and poverty without any escape routes, at times being exposed to extreme violence, when unable to repay.Here is how YOU can make a difference.Our vision at WalletBoss is to create communities composed of socially conscious people willing to help those in need, bringing together investors with potential borrowers, providing a convenient worldwide on-line platform, with the opportunity to grant and take and moral loans.In order to jumpstart the model on a global scale and validate the concept, WalletBoss needs people like you to help us launch this amazing project. Just choose the amount you’d like to invest in the project, and from as little as US $2, you can download the app (Click here to Download) and start lending money to those who need it most.

There is a lack of research providing specific data about wheelchair users, locations, and private rental housing needs etc. This presents a significant challenge for us in being able to help those that most need our help. We are currently working with charities such as Aspire (https://www.aspire.org.uk) to assist us in collating this valuable information. To help us overcome this key risk we are supported by expert input from wheelchair users and their advocates. These include Mike Mackenzie, Chairman of the Poppa Guttman Trust (http://www.poppaguttmanncelebration.org), and Aspire (https://www.aspire.org.uk), the UK’s leading spinal cord injury charity providing short term rental accommodation. WE NEED YOU TO SHOW YOUR SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY SPONSORS HOMESCrowdfunding on Indiegogo is a great way to begin our movement. Everyone who donates, no matter how much or how little, is important to us.

<h3>The GrowHaus Story</h3>
<p>The mission of <a href=""https://www.thegrowhaus.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The GrowHaus</a> is to cultivate community-driven food justice through education and food access. They offer food distribution programming and educational opportunities related to growing and cooking food, as well as overall wellness. The organization serves the Globeville and Elyria-Swansea (GES) neighborhoods, two vibrant neighborhoods in North Denver, rich in culture and tradition. However, residents of GES face barriers to living a healthy lifestyle. There is not one full service grocery store for the 10,000 residents living in GES. Additionally, the heavily industrious neighborhood has been deemed one of the most polluted zip codes in the country. However, residents of Globeville and Elyria-Swansea are incredibly resilient and passionate about supporting their neighbors and ensuring healthy food access.  </p>
<p>The GrowHaus strives to be a community-driven organization, meaning that their goal is to have all programs led and implemented by members of their community or others from similar neighborhoods. They are successful when the youth, families, and communities that they work with are empowered to feed, nourish and strengthen themselves and each other.</p>
<h3>The GrowHaus and COVID-19</h3>
<p>At their core, The GrowHaus is committed to ensuring healthy food access in Globeville and Elyria-Swansea. In response to the <a href=""https://www.thegrowhaus.org/covid-19-response"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">COVID-19 crisis</a> outbreak, The GrowHaus has taken several steps to support residents of GES, ensuring that they are receiving food and have information and resources to support themselves in this difficult moment. At the best of times, accessing food -- especially healthy food -- is difficult for their community. The necessity of social distancing, economic disruption, and health risks make this moment especially challenging. The GrowHaus is acting quickly to overcome these barriers.</p>
<p>At the onset of COVID-19, The GrowHaus launched an emergency food distribution program to support residents. Emergency food packages include a a bag of fresh produce as well as a bag of dry food staples. The GrowHaus has been distributing these food packages every week to over 550 families, providing 2,550 kids and adults <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">with nourishment and comfort. In total, The GrowHaus has distributed the equivalent of over 356,000 free meals. </span></p>
<p>Additionally, The GrowHaus is supporting families in Globeville and Elyria-Swansea with classes for adults and at-home learning kits for kids. Classes for adults are all held outdoors, with appropriate safety precautions, and focus on overall wellness, in addition to nutrition. In the midst of COVID-19, our team has also been distributing at-home learning kits to families with kids that provide interactive activities for kiddos to learn about healthy food. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p><strong>The GrowHaus needs additional funds to continue providing emergency food to families in the Globeville and Elyria-Swansea community. Please consider making a donation to support their important work, especially during the pandemic, when ensuring rapid response to those in need is more crucial than ever. The Real Dill will be matching all donations up to $10,000 to show our support and solidarity.</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $15,000 for The GrowHaus, which is more than we ever have in the past. We are counting on our amazing community to rally together and make this our biggest and best fundraiser to date by collecting as many donations as possible. Every dollar helps!</p>
<p>We also reached out to some of our favorite partners to bring you incredible rewards that can be enjoyed locally and virtually. Make a generous donation in exchange for perks such as gift cards, gift packs, tickets to virtual classes, and more. <strong>All rewards are priced at double the value of the reward to maximize our fundraising efforts.</strong> Once you have claimed your reward, we will contact you to coordinate pickup (either at a physical location or virtually). </p>
<p>If you have a few dollars to spare, you also have the option of donating without receiving a perk.</p>

Contracts, divorce, wills, probate court. But what happens if you can’t afford a lawyer? Do you know the law well enough to represent yourself in the complex world of legal matters? For many Canadians, legal representation is just too expensive, and legal information is too hard to find or too complex to fully understand. Innovative SolutionThe nonprofit Canadian Rights and Freedoms Centre, partnering with three Nova Scotian regional public library systems, has developed an innovative solution - affordable legal assistance for those who wish to represent themselves in civil and family matters.                                                          The People's Legal Cafe as a Social EnterpriseThe People’s Legal Café, founded by the Canadian Rights and Freedoms Centre, is a social enterprise that will provide affordable and simplified legal services. Surpluses generated by the Legal Cafés will flow back to the People’s Legal Café, Canadian Rights and Freedoms Centre and the partnering public libraries to help the social good. Friends of Democracy: Public LibrariesLibraries actively support literacy and computer skills. A perfect fit for the People's Legal Café! The Canadian Rights and Freedoms Centre has been working in partnership with the Pictou-Antigonish Regional Library, the Public Library of Colchester- East Hants and the Cumberland Public Libraries since 2017 developing the components of the website and fundraising. The Legal Café  will have their storefronts in the public libraries. Making Life Simple: The Legal Café WebsiteYou will go to the website. Answer some questionnaires and the forms are completed for you! People's Legal Café paralegals and lawyers will provide in-person or telephone support to review the completed court forms produced on the website. Legal Fees or Maybe NotThen review your forms with a People's Legal Café paralegal or lawyer before filing them with the court. Fees are on a sliding scale – users pay based on level of income. For users with low income, services are free.                                                                       A Collaborative, Respectful Legal CultureThe goal of the People's Legal Café is to support customers to legally respond in ways that are  effective, respectful and collaborative. Legal Café lawyers assist customers to represent themselves in legal matters;  to resolve their own conflicts. Customers learn to communicate in ways that de-escalate their conflict.  We’ve already started!We’ve already started! We’ve raised over $20,000 for this project, and development is underway on the family court forms  and the People's Legal Café website.

FM ALAS no tiene oyentes sino<strong> radioparticipantes</strong>. Nos conocemos, nos relacionamos, y no hay límite entre quién habla y quien escucha porque todos y todas podemos hacer las dos cosas. En nuestra zona el internet todavía no está al alcance de todos (sobre todo en la población rural) y la radio sigue siendo el medio preferido de mucha gente para enterarse de lo que necesita saber.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505081680/vbbyfvppwvqp2gnihfs5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Sostenemos una <strong>defensa irrestricta de los derechos humanos y de los bienes comunes</strong>. Y ante todo hacemos posible que las voces que no aparecen en los medios comerciales y estatales salgan al aire. En ALAS hacen programas:</p><ul>
<li>las asambleas socioambientales</li>
<li>los usuarios del servicio de salud mental del hospital</li>
<li>las organizaciones de derechos humanos</li>

</ul><p> </p><p>Pero no sólo jugamos a hacer radio. Nos encargamos también producir periodismo de calidad que disputa un territorio en el debate público, sobre todo cuando los medios dominantes esquivan las problemáticas de la población.</p><p>Por eso en los últimos años FM ALAS ha sido un nexo crucial para un sinfín de movimientos sociales en nuestra región, como para nombrar sólo algunos:</p><ul>
<li>Resistencias a proyectos megamineros que amenazan nuestras tierras y fuentes de agua</li>
<li>Resistencias al gatillo fácil, los abusos policiales y la desaparición de personas</li>
<li>
<i>Ni una menos</i>, movimiento en contra de la violencia machista</li>
<li>Reivindicaciones del pueblo mapuche, y sus recuperaciones territoriales</li>

Además lo usamos para capacitar a todos y todas quienes quieran aprender a hacer radio, desde lo técnico hasta lo creativo y lo periodístico.</p><p>Ahí hacemos empanadas para las peñas con ingredientes que aportan radioparticipantes. Juntamos manzanas y las prensamos para tener jugo casero y natural en nuestro buffet. E infinitas cosas más que nos mantienen volando hace 30 años. No nos financia nadie, y logramos estar al aire todos los días de este modo cooperativo y solidario; sabemos muy bien realizar mucho con poquísimo dinero.</p><p> </p><h2>Los detalles:</h2><p>Ahora ese trabajo que nos sostiene en el día a día ya no alcanza. Hoy para seguir haciendo que la comunicación sea un derecho al alcance de todos, necesitamos una casa propia. Nuestra sede actual que alquilamos está en venta. Con la ayuda solidaria de muchísima gente podremos comprarla para que no tenga dueño, para que las voces de todos y de todas vuelen libremente.</p><h3>¿Porqué no seguir alquilando?</h3><p>Como colectivo tomamos la decisión de comprar la casa y no intentar alquilar en otro lugar porque:</p><ul>
<li>así la comunidad se asegura que su radio perdure en el tiempo</li>
<li>ya no somos sólo una radio, queremos seguir nuestro trabajo cultural en el SUM, lo cual no sería posible alquilando una construcción pequeña sólo para estudio de radio, y no hay disponibles salones con las características necesarias para que funcione nuestra sala</li>
<li>el alquiler se ha vuelto una tarea difícil de sostener, y sólo lo logramos gracias a pagar un monto bien por debajo del valor del mercado. Empezar a alquilar en un lugar nuevo tendría un costo excluyente para nosotros en lo cotidiano.</li>
<li>una radio y una sala requieren de una infraestructura importante, las mudanzas son difíciles y muy caras; hoy el mercado inmobiliario es muy volátil y no podemos arriesgar tener que seguir mudándonos según los azares del mercado</li>
</ul><p>Con un empujón fuerte de todos y todas podemos llegar a hacer realidad nuestro sueño del nido propio. Si alcanzamos nuesta meta de US$89,100 que representa nuestra frecuencia de 89.1 MHz<strong> cubrimos el primer pago</strong> de la mitad del valor de la casa, y tendríamos 2 años más para pagar la otra mitad.</p><h3>¿Hay un Plan B?</h3><p>Si no recaudamos ese monto antes de fin de año, nuestra segunda opción es comprar otro terreno sin construir más económico y luego sumar lo necesario para la construcción de una nueva radio con su SUM. Es decir, <strong>aunque no alcanzamos ese primer objetivo, igual nos sirve</strong>. Y cuanto sea lo recaudado, habrá una segunda etapa de financiamiento, o para completar la compra de la casa o para construir el edificio nuevo. Tenemos muchas manos hábiles entre nosotros, tenemos la plena confianza de que la mano de obra será nuestra y sólo hará falta comprar los materiales.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505097535/sriy7ygbapwltudhwvvh.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:left;""/></p><p>Y tomen nota: <strong>la cifra que ven en esta página es sólo una parte de lo que recaudamos</strong>.

 En breveFM ALAS es una Radio Comunitaria de la Patagonia sostenida de manera participativa desde hace 30 años.Nos hemos convertido en un actor preponderante de la identidad regional así como un medio confiable en el que circulan las voces de la comunidad.Somos también un factor escencial en los procesos sociales y la defensa de los Derechos Humanos y de la Naturaleza.Somos una organización horizontal, no jerárquica, sin fines de lucro, y en este momento todos y todas aportamos nuestro trabajo ad honorem. Somos una radio autónoma, apartidaria, autogestiva, autocrítica, solidaria, laica y pluricultural. Hoy somos una de las radios más escuchadas de nuestro pueblo, El Bolsón, de una injerencia a la par con la radio estatal y las comerciales.El nido propio, $89,100 por la 89.1 MHzLa casa que alquilamos hace 2 décadas está en venta. Antes de fin de año la tenemos que comprar, o en su defecto comprar otro lugar y construir nuestra radio. De cualquier modo, el tiempo apremia y necesitamos la ayuda de todos y todas. Cualquier aporte, del monto que sea, es una ramita de nuestro nido, del nido de toda la comuniad. Todo lo recaudado va directamente a la compra de esta casa, o en el caso de comprar otro lugar, a comprarlo y realizar la mudanza.
Quienes somosCuando la mediatización constante sigue acelerando y se pierde la referencia de qué es confiable, sabemos que podemos confiar en nuestras radios comunitarias porque son nuestras. FM ALAS no tiene oyentes sino radioparticipantes. Nos conocemos, nos relacionamos, y no hay límite entre quién habla y quien escucha porque todos y todas podemos hacer las dos cosas. En nuestra zona el internet todavía no está al alcance de todos (sobre todo en la población rural) y la radio sigue siendo el medio preferido de mucha gente para enterarse de lo que necesita saber.Sostenemos una defensa irrestricta de los derechos humanos y de los bienes comunes. Y ante todo hacemos posible que las voces que no aparecen en los medios comerciales y estatales salgan al aire. En ALAS hacen programas:
las asambleas socioambientales
los usuarios del servicio de salud mental del hospital
las organizaciones de derechos humanos
las comunidades mapuches
colectivos feministas y por la diversidad sexual
estudiantes secundarios y universitarios
agricultores familiares
personas con discapacidad
los niños y las niñas
los adultos mayores
conjuntos de músicos locales, y muchísimos más.
 Pero no sólo jugamos a hacer radio. Nos encargamos también producir periodismo de calidad que disputa un territorio en el debate público, sobre todo cuando los medios dominantes esquivan las problemáticas de la población.Por eso en los últimos años FM ALAS ha sido un nexo crucial para un sinfín de movimientos sociales en nuestra región, como para nombrar sólo algunos:
Resistencias a proyectos megamineros que amenazan nuestras tierras y fuentes de agua
Resistencias al gatillo fácil, los abusos policiales y la desaparición de personas

Ni una menos, movimiento en contra de la violencia machista
Reivindicaciones del pueblo mapuche, y sus recuperaciones territoriales
Resistencias a megaloteos y corrupción en el manejo de tierras públicas
Reclamos por el libre acceso a los lagos y los ríos
Reclamos por los derechos de los/las estudiantes
En varias ocasiones, cuando sucesos de nuestra región trascendieron a nivel nacional o internacional, muchísimos medios de diversos lugares han recurrido a FM ALAS para saber qué pasa en la zona y así nuestro trabajo periodístico llegó más allá de las fronteras regionales.Apostamos al debate y la participación activa. Consultamos las diversas fuentes para llevar al aire distintas miradas sobre los hechos relevantes. Producimos recorriendo las calles y conscientes de ser parte de la comunidad que relatamos.Somos miembros de la Asociación Mundial de Radios Comunitarias, con quien trabajamos en la producción de un programa informativo nacional. Además somos miembros fundadores de la red de la red de medios alternativos, comunitarios y populares “Enfoques”, que entrelaza doce medios de la Patagonia norte en un informativo regional y transmisiones especiales.  Cómo sostenemos nuestro trabajoSostenemos la radio principalmente a través del trabajo solidario en nuestro Salón de Usos Múltiples, donde hacemos funciones culturales de todo tipo (conciertos, teatro, talleres, charlas.) No sólo sostiene la radio económicamente sino que es una de las salas culturales principales de nuestro pueblo. Por el SUM pasan todos los artistas locales, y además invitamos a tocar en la Comarca a otros como Raly Barrionuevo, Chango Spasiuk, Arbolito, Falta y Resto, Yusa, María Creuza, Leo Masliah, Teresa Parodi, Baglietto y Vitale...El SUM de ALAS albergó también a Eduardo Galeano, Berta Cáceres, Nora Cortiñas, y tantos otros que vinieron a aportar su palabra a nuestra comunidad. Además lo usamos para capacitar a todos y todas quienes quieran aprender a hacer radio, desde lo técnico hasta lo creativo y lo periodístico.Ahí hacemos empanadas para las peñas con ingredientes que aportan radioparticipantes. Juntamos manzanas y las prensamos para tener jugo casero y natural en nuestro buffet. E infinitas cosas más que nos mantienen volando hace 30 años. No nos financia nadie, y logramos estar al aire todos los días de este modo cooperativo y solidario; sabemos muy bien realizar mucho con poquísimo dinero. Los detalles:Ahora ese trabajo que nos sostiene en el día a día ya no alcanza. Hoy para seguir haciendo que la comunicación sea un derecho al alcance de todos, necesitamos una casa propia. Nuestra sede actual que alquilamos está en venta. Con la ayuda solidaria de muchísima gente podremos comprarla para que no tenga dueño, para que las voces de todos y de todas vuelen libremente.¿Porqué no seguir alquilando?Como colectivo tomamos la decisión de comprar la casa y no intentar alquilar en otro lugar porque:
así la comunidad se asegura que su radio perdure en el tiempo
ya no somos sólo una radio, queremos seguir nuestro trabajo cultural en el SUM, lo cual no sería posible alquilando una construcción pequeña sólo para estudio de radio, y no hay disponibles salones con las características necesarias para que funcione nuestra sala
el alquiler se ha vuelto una tarea difícil de sostener, y sólo lo logramos gracias a pagar un monto bien por debajo del valor del mercado. Empezar a alquilar en un lugar nuevo tendría un costo excluyente para nosotros en lo cotidiano.
una radio y una sala requieren de una infraestructura importante, las mudanzas son difíciles y muy caras; hoy el mercado inmobiliario es muy volátil y no podemos arriesgar tener que seguir mudándonos según los azares del mercado
Con un empujón fuerte de todos y todas podemos llegar a hacer realidad nuestro sueño del nido propio. Si alcanzamos nuesta meta de US$89,100 que representa nuestra frecuencia de 89.1 MHz cubrimos el primer pago de la mitad del valor de la casa, y tendríamos 2 años más para pagar la otra mitad.¿Hay un Plan B?Si no recaudamos ese monto antes de fin de año, nuestra segunda opción es comprar otro terreno sin construir más económico y luego sumar lo necesario para la construcción de una nueva radio con su SUM. Es decir, aunque no alcanzamos ese primer objetivo, igual nos sirve. Y cuanto sea lo recaudado, habrá una segunda etapa de financiamiento, o para completar la compra de la casa o para construir el edificio nuevo. Tenemos muchas manos hábiles entre nosotros, tenemos la plena confianza de que la mano de obra será nuestra y sólo hará falta comprar los materiales.Y tomen nota: la cifra que ven en esta página es sólo una parte de lo que recaudamos. Esta campaña sirve más que nada para los que están lejos. Ya la población local está aportando un montón directamente a la radio sin pasar por Indiegogo, por ende el número que ven aquí es en realidad más alto de lo que parece. Al momento de lanzar esto aquí, ya tenemos US$10,000 y seguiremos actualizando ese número también.Si querés aportar y no podés a través de esta plataforma, visita nuestra página www.fmalas.org.ar donde figuran otras vías de contribución.  ¿Qué recibís vos?Respecto a las recompensas (""perks"") lamentablemente no podemos enviar cosas físicas fuera del país, por eso nos hemos limitado principalmente a cosas no materiales y que invitan a que nos conectemos y nos conozcamos, no sólo intercambiar dinero y cosas.El impacto de tu solidaridadSabemos que para muchos que leen estas palabras desde otras partes del mundo, la Patagonia es un paisaje lejano y desconocido con el que tal vez no tengan ninguna relación. Pero hoy en día es una de las fronteras donde la maquinaria de un sistema injusto que quiere devorar todo se choca con otro modo de imaginar al mundo. En ese frente estamos nosotros.Aquí todavía hay más bosques que ciudadesmás agricultura que monocultivosmás artesanos que centros comercialesmás ciclistas que semáforosmás encuentros que conectividadmás radioparticipantes que oyentesTu aporte solidario ayuda a que siga siendo así.  Que nuestro micrófono sigue al aire para quien lo necesite.Otras formas de ayudarAyudanos a difundir esta campaña, con las herramientas de Indiegogo arriba, en tus redes sociales, por mail, por mensajito telefónico, hasta con tu boca! Te acordás cuando la gente hablaba con sus amigos en vez de sólo leer sus posteos? Nosotros seguimos apostando al poder de la voz humana. Comentale a tus amigos mientras patean una pelota o andan en bicicleta, mientras toman un mate en tu living o buscan a sus hijos en la escuela.Es aún mejor si en vez de pasar sólo el link, agregás palabras tuyas explicando cómo nos conocés y porqué te parece valioso que ALAS tenga su nido. Por cualquier consulta, escribir afmalaselbolson@gmail.comY no olvides de visitarnos en:www.fmalas.org.arwww.facebook.com/fmalas891   English 
Who We AreWhere some think the internet democratized access to information, ALAS has been doing just that since 1987. As Argentina threw off its military dictatorship in the '80s, the need for community-based media became an imperative, and radio has long been the preferred way of staying informed here. Today, as the media landscape gets increasingly saturated and confusing, it gets even harder to know who to trust and what to believe. We know we can rely on our community radio stations because they're ours. ALAS has no “listeners,” but rather radio-participants. Our sources are our community, our microphone is available for anyone who needs it, and over years of hard work we have earned a broad listenership and wide-ranging impact. We know each other, we relate to each other, and there is a healthy back-and-forth between those who speak and those who listen because all of us make sure to do both. We don't run a radio to amplify our own voices and spread our own opinions, but rather to make sure others can do so, especially those who the mainstream media ignores. We tell stories no one else does.We maintain an unconditional defense of human rights and of the commons, what others would call “natural resources,” too often pillaged from areas like ours that the powerful see as far-off colonies to be plundered. On ALAS, there are programs produced by: 
indigenous Mapuche communities
patients of the public mental health services
environmental justice assemblies
human rights organizations
high school and college students
feminist and LGBTQ collectives
family farmers and subsistence herders
people with disabilities
children and the elderly
local musicians
and many, many more
But we are not hobbyists just out to give everyone a chance to get their voice on the air. It is our mission to speak truth to power and to do quality, thoughtful journalism that stakes out territory in the public conversation, especially when powerful interests keep the mainstream media away from the real issues.That's why in recent years ALAS has been a crucial piece of organizing myriad social movements in Patagonia, including (but by no means limited to): 
resistance to large-scale open-pit mining projects that would destroy our water sources and landbase
resistance to police brutality and killings (particularly of young people) and forced disappearances
the nationwide “Ni una menos” campaign to combat violence against women
defense of indigenous land rights and even Mapuche communities reclaiming land stolen by foreign multinationals (link al video)
resistance to landgrabs and corrupt dealings on public lands
fighting for our constitutionally guaranteed access to all bodies of water, in our area flagrantly broken by multibillionaires like Joe Lewis or Ted Turner who have privatized public lakes and rivers
working on behalf of political prisoners and fighting abuses within the justice system
On many occasions, when events in our area draw national attention, many other media depend on ALAS as a trusted source to get the story out. Not just other community media like us, but also mainstream nationally syndicated newspapers, radio, and TV. We aim to foment healthy debate, not ideological antagonism, and keep our eyes on the goal of finding shared means to ensure a healthy and just future for everyone, for coming generations and for the land we live on.We are members of AMARC, the World Association of Community Radios, and along with the other AMARC member stations in Argentina, we produce a national weekly news service. We also are the founders and headquarters of “Enfoques”, a network of 10 community radios across Patagonia that join forces to produce a regional news bulletin, as well as frequent special transmissions that often share the airwaves of all 10 stations.How We Stay on the AirWe cover our costs primarily through our cultural center, which not only sustains the radio station but is another pillar of our work in its own right.  We have live events on average 3 nights per week, from concerts and film screenings to theater, book presentations, talks and debates.

The people who are behind the UKCSAPT can be found on our website: www.ukcsapt.org.uk and our current activity on twitter @UKCSAPT. 
We are all volunteers who believe that every child deserves to have their human rights protected.  While many people believed we would not make it this far, it is these ideals that have kept us going.   PLEASE HELP Our panel of independent experts are currently writing a report in order to bring the issues surrounding child sex abuse to light and to encourage fair and frank discussion regarding the issue.
We are raising money because we want to launch the report in a public sphere in February 2016. The report will give concrete and realistic recommendations on what everyone in the UK can do to protect children. We hope that it will also serve as a model to other countries in the world struggling with this issue. The only way we can do that is through the help of generous people. The UKCSAPT has made it this far because of voluntary donations.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<li>Our legal funds have run dry and the Slough family has put up tens of thousands of dollars for attorneys to seek a pardon for the men of Raven 23. You can help!</li>
<li>Every family has mounting bills, no income from their incarcerated veteran and have been taking care of financial matters on their own for four long years.</li>
<li>All four men receive commissary funds each month, up to $500 each so that they can purchase food, hobby supplies, mailing materials, email and call home.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>In Summary </h3>
<p>Most of all, we ask people to look at both sides of the story - not just the one that the government told that was presented in the media. As a matter of fact, we were instructed by the judge not to interact in the media... so we have never been given the opportunity to defend ourselves our publicly. By the time they were convicted the damage had been done and people’s minds were made up... However, by the grace of God alone, we had been offered new opportunities to give the public and our administration the complete picture and ask for your help in doing so.</p>

Our legal funds have run dry and the Slough family has put up tens of thousands of dollars for attorneys to seek a pardon for the men of Raven 23. You can help!
Every family has mounting bills, no income from their incarcerated veteran and have been taking care of financial matters on their own for four long years.
All four men receive commissary funds each month, up to $500 each so that they can purchase food, hobby supplies, mailing materials, email and call home.


In Summary 
Most of all, we ask people to look at both sides of the story - not just the one that the government told that was presented in the media. As a matter of fact, we were instructed by the judge not to interact in the media... so we have never been given the opportunity to defend ourselves our publicly. By the time they were convicted the damage had been done and people’s minds were made up... However, by the grace of God alone, we had been offered new opportunities to give the public and our administration the complete picture and ask for your help in doing so.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<b>The Police are exaggerating!</b>
<br/><p>TRENTON 4/29 - Less than 30 hours after his East State Street businesses were raided by police, Ed Forchion was back at the Joint, rolling a joint and vowing to beat county prosecutors in court. </p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_yfwHxKedk"" width=""560""></iframe></div>
<br/> 
____________________________________________________
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">“They just gave me another platform to continue my goal,” Forchion told The Trentonian at 10:30 p.m. Thursday, about two hours after his release from jail. “This is exactly what happened in Burlington County. I beat those prosecutors, and I’ll beat the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office too. They’re on the wrong side of history.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Forchion, who’s a marijuana legalization activist known as NJWeedman, was arrested Wednesday along with 10 other people when the <a href=""http://www.trentonian.com/20160428/11-arrested-during-raid-on-nj-weedmans-joint-more-than-19k-in-pot-seized"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">county narcotics task force raided his restaurant</a>, sanctuary and tobacco shop, which are adjoined and located across the street from City Hall.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Prosecutors say police confiscated $19,000 worth of marijuana during the raid, and seized cars and cash as suspected proceeds from drug sales. The arrests and seizures were the result of a two-month long investigation, and Forchion was charged with multiple drug possession and distribution offenses.</p>
<p></p>
<div></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“It may have been worth a few hundred dollars, but $19,000 worth of weed...are they crazy?” Forchion said. “And distribution? What? They didn’t catch me selling weed to no one. Just about everyone here is a smoker. So yes, there’s weed here. But there’s no distribution going on. They exaggerated big time.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Forchion said some of the edible marijuana products were leftover from a 420 celebration earlier this month. He also said patrons were scared when they saw cops with rifles, so some of them tossed their bags and Forchion was charged for having them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Sharing is part of the weed culture,” Forchion said. “I share because I care, and it’s wrong for them to criminalize that. A lot of people come in here with weed and we share. Sharing is not selling. We’re not running any kind of illegal enterprise out of here.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition to the pot and paraphernalia offenses, Forchion was charged for having five ounces of promethazine on the property, which is a prescription antihistamine normally used to treat allergies and nausea.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I didn’t even know what promethazine was,” Forchion said. “It turns out that my business partner has a prescription for it and the medicine was here.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Police also seized his digital video recorder and Weedmobile, Forchion said.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I’ve been videotaping them, so they took my DVR and charged me for having it,” Forchion said. “They said it’s a crime to have a surveillance system if you’re selling drugs. But we’re not selling drugs. We sell turkey burgers.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Forchion believes the raid was the latest chapter in an ongoing feud he’s having with politicians who oppose his religious beliefs and views on marijuana legalization.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Forchion is Rastafarian and his religious practices include ritual use of marijuana. He says the paperwork he filed with the state’s division of taxation lists the property between the restaurant and tobacco shop as a “cannabis church.” Forchion believes his church should be allowed to operate 24 hours a day, just as any Baptist church would be allowed to do. After police shut down his religious temple last month for violation of city code, Forchion filed an injunction in federal court to keep it open after 11 p.m.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“This is the politics of pot in New Jersey,” Forchion said. “This is about certain people refusing to accept that I have a church next to my other businesses. One of the police officers even told me the operation wasn’t initiated by the Trenton Police Department. They assisted in the investigation, but it was set in motion by someone else. Politics are in play here.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Prosecutors said the investigation that led to the raid was sparked by citizen complaints regarding constant foot traffic at the businesses and marijuana being sold from out of the building.</p>
<p>Forchion said he’s “looking forward to the trial,” and that he knows he has the public on his side in regard to marijuana laws.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“I’m a proponent of jury nullification and I’m going to take this to trial,” Forchion said. “Once again I get to publicly argue my case in court and be David fighting the Goliath of government.”</p>

The Trentonian, by Penny Ray


The Police are exaggerating!
TRENTON 4/29 - Less than 30 hours after his East State Street businesses were raided by police, Ed Forchion was back at the Joint, rolling a joint and vowing to beat county prosecutors in court. 

 
____________________________________________________
“They just gave me another platform to continue my goal,” Forchion told The Trentonian at 10:30 p.m. Thursday, about two hours after his release from jail. “This is exactly what happened in Burlington County. I beat those prosecutors, and I’ll beat the Mercer County Prosecutor’s Office too. They’re on the wrong side of history.”
Forchion, who’s a marijuana legalization activist known as NJWeedman, was arrested Wednesday along with 10 other people when the county narcotics task force raided his restaurant, sanctuary and tobacco shop, which are adjoined and located across the street from City Hall.
Prosecutors say police confiscated $19,000 worth of marijuana during the raid, and seized cars and cash as suspected proceeds from drug sales. The arrests and seizures were the result of a two-month long investigation, and Forchion was charged with multiple drug possession and distribution offenses.


“It may have been worth a few hundred dollars, but $19,000 worth of weed...are they crazy?” Forchion said. “And distribution? What? They didn’t catch me selling weed to no one.

The world is watching for now, but we know from the past that such engagement can be fleeting. Even as we are mourning and responding to the devastating results of this chapter of ongoing Israeli settler colonialism and apartheid, we are planning for the road ahead. We need your steady commitment on this road to justice with us...before the next atrocity. Invest in Movement Education Right now, people new to our movement are actively seeking out and sharing resources to understand the Palestinian struggle. For years, our movement education work has been helping people teach and learn about the root causes of Palestinian oppression, adopt a vision and language that affirms fundamental rights, and speak out in their communities. Our resources are in especially high demand now and our voices are becoming more important than ever.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>My campaign is to raise funds to travel to the exclusive Brooklyn, New York Urban Bush Women's 2017 Summer Leadership Institute July 27th - August 6, 2017.  Purchase t-shirts, food and the St. Louis City permit to march in the streets to Progressive Emporium.  The Ujamaa Group Economics March is civic engagement bringing awareness to how Black people must support Black businesses that vitally educate and empower us.  Thirdly, these funds will allow me to book a venue, microphones and other equipment needed to make my 1st Annual Dance-A-Fun Fundraiser a success.  This family-friendly 4 - 8 hour dance day will be held to bring awareness to the harm of our silence regarding the topics sexual abuse and sex trafficking.</li>
<li>As a recent victim of domestic violence and victim blaming, I was fired from a position that I made the most money that I have made in my life.  Dec. 25, 2016, Perrie Gibson AKA Yah Ammi assaulted me and talked himself out of being arrested.  As a result, I took to social media for justice.  5 days later the corporation that I made so much money fired me!  Now I am sorely financially impoverished with Federal, State and local debts.  Your financial gifts will encourage me to keep fighting for social and economic freedom for the African diaspora.  This year, I take further steps toward leading our local communities to trusting each other and working together.  I stand to gain a plethora of skills that will help our community; at this exclusive Urban Bush Women 2017 Summer Leadership Institute.    ""('SLI') is our annual 10-day intensive that serves as the foundation for all of UBW’s community engagement activities.<strong> SLI builds the global network of community arts practitioners,</strong> and what Zollar calls 'front line social justice workers,' <strong>by connecting dance professionals and community-based artists in a learning experience that leverages the arts as a vehicle for social activism and civic engagement</strong>.""   (<a href=""http://www.urbanbushwomen.org/bold/summer-leadership-institute/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.urbanbushwomen.org/bold/summer-leadership-institute/</a>)  Give in order that I may travel, lodge and commute to Brooklyn, New York.</li>
<li>The Ujamaa Group Economics March being held June 24, 2017 in St. Louis is an extra-curricular event that I am leading.  Inspired by Master Teacher Kaba Kamene Hiawatha AKA Booker T. Coleman, Jr. who told us last summer several action plans to empower, activate the African communities.  Baba Kamene Hiawatha had this to say about this upcoming event:   ""When we ask, 'What's our solution?' I say, 'If you want to March, March to the nearest American African owned store and spend $25...Buyout Black Businesses. Congratulations to the Ujamaa Group Economics March!!!  Can you imagine what would happen if this concept spread throughout the African community? Keep on Keepin' On. It ain't over 'til we win. Kaba Hiawatha” These funds will allow me to purchase the needed St. Louis City permit to march in the streets; t-shirts and food for after we march and socialize at Progressive Emporium.</li>
<li>Lastly, I am hosting a fundraiser to raise awareness about sexual abuse and molestation.  I was molested by my father as a child and that had lasting effects on me.  We do not talk about the prevalence of family molestation, sexual abuse and sex trafficking in detail enough.  In this world, we know people are being molested and sex trafficked but we aren't having hard conversations about it.  This dance event stands to discuss how prevalent sexual abuse and trafficking are in our local communities.  Being molested by the person, who was supposed to protect me from abusers, had a lasting effect on my life and personal relationships.  This event will be fun, coed and family friendly because I always want the youth involved.  The desire is to book a venue, rent microphones, stages, hire a DJ and other things to produce this dance event to arrest sexual abuse and trafficking.</li>

<p>:</p>
<ul><li>Hoping to raise at least $7,000.  $2,000 of the money will purchase my round-trip airplane tickets to Brooklyn, New York July 27th - Aug. 6th; rent a hotel room, rent a rental car, purchase food and any other necessary items for the Urban Bush Women's 2017 Summer Leadership Institute.<ul>
<li>$1,500 of the funds raised here will purchase the St. Louis City permit needed to march in the streets June 24th.  Purchase the event t-shirts and buy food for the marchers to eat after we have spent our $25 each.</li>
<li>The rest of the money ($3,500) will be spent planning the First Annual Dance-A-Fun to arrest sexual abuse and trafficking.  I can book a large of enough venue space for at least 500, women, men and women to dance for 4 - 8 hours.  It's important that we exercise at least 30 minutes a day to remain healthy and heart healthy.  Dance is great cardio.  Your children get to dance with you and watch you have fun.  This event's cause is arresting sexual abuse and trafficking.  At the ALIVE &amp; Well STL Trauma Training this year I learned that if you have experience at least 1 traumatic event as a child, that event increases the likelihood that you will experience a traumatic event as an adult.<ul>

<p>I tried raising money for a lawyer a few years ago before my 4 children were adopted.  The fundraiser was unsuccessful maybe because I was not very open and transparent about what I was experiencing.  Today, I am more mature and accepting of my life's experiences.  Therefore, I know that my life’s challenges not only molded me to be the leader that I am but will also inspire others.  Some challenges maybe in getting this campaign to the right compassionate people in the world who are willing to share their resources with another person that cares.</p>

<h3>H2Ouse</h3>
<p>We are the POP Warriors from Prince of Peace Christian School in Carrolton TX and we’re participating in the First Lego League robotics competition. This season, we were challenged to improve the way people find, transport, use, or dispose of water.</p>
<p>Last summer, Connor visited Thailand. While driving through the poor areas, he noticed that the people were wearing dirty, rugged clothing and torn up sandals. It really changed the way he saw the world, and he wanted to help the people who were living those conditions.</p>
<p>When Connor told the team his story, it touched all of our hearts and then we too wanted to help the poor people.</p>
<p>So, the team decided to incorporate refugees with this year’s water project.</p>
<p>The problem that we decided to solve was the lack of clean water in the refugee camps in Bangladesh or other surrounding areas that are populated by the people from Myanmar.</p>
<p>In these camps, the residents have to walk for miles to get to their water that comes from muddy lakes. They have to bathe, drink, cook, and wash their belongings in the same source of water every day. As you can imagine, there are tons of diseases in these camps because of the poor conditions these people are living in.</p>
<p>Other ways that people have solved this problem are to drill wells, setup rain collecting barrels, provide filters, or deliver bottled water, which is too expensive and dangerous.</p>
<p> Our solution is called H2Ouse. H2Ouse is better because it provides shelter, as well as a renewable water source. It also saves the refugee's from having to walk miles to get their water.</p>
<p>With cleaner water, we can help decrease the chance of catching diseases, and help the refugees live a happier and healthier life.</p>
<p>We are planning to use stackable plastic water storage bricks to build a shelter that catches rain. H2Ouse will be a safe way to store water, unlike dirty, unclean, water storage. It will improve their everyday life by not drinking out of the same water they bathe in.</p>
<p>There is a water brick commercially available that is used store water. We plan to modify the design to allow the water to drain from brick to brick.

They'll be similar in size and construction, and we think it will be about the same cost to produce.</p>
<p>We plan to build a working 3D scale model of what H2Ouse will look like. It will be a 1/5 scale model of the H2Ouse which is six feet wide, nine feet long, and six feet high.

H2Ouse will hold about 700 gallons of clean water that can be used for cooking, cleaning, and drinking.  </p>
<p>Weatherbase.com says that the average rainfall in Bangladesh is about 10 in. per month. We've calculated that in the rainy months, we will collect up to 1200 gallons of water in each shelter. According to The UN Refugee Agency, the average refugee needs around 5 gallons of water per day to survive. This means the average family of four needs about 600 gallons to survive each month.</p>
<p>Based off the cost of the commercially available water bricks, we believe that the manufacturing price will be about $4.00 per brick. It'll take about 200 bricks to build 1 shelter.</p>
<p> 1 complete H2Ouse will fit on two standard palates, and 20 shelters will fit in a standard 40ft ISO shipping container. We've determined that it will cost $575.00 to ship a container over sea.</p>

<p>We think it will take about three hours for two people to build one H2Ouse. We visited the International Rescue Committee and we learned what stagnate water is and we learned more about what it's like to live in a refugee camp and how the refugees receive their water.

<p>In conclusion, we believe that we can help change the lives of the refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh. But, H2Ouse can also be used in other tropical areas other than Bangladesh.

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<div>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $6,250 dollars to help create a working 3D scale model of the H2Ouse.</p>
<p>If we can't raise enough money, our first option is to buy our own small 3D printer which will be less expensive, but will take six months to print the model.

We are the POP Warriors from Prince of Peace Christian School in Carrolton TX and we’re participating in the First Lego League robotics competition. This season, we were challenged to improve the way people find, transport, use, or dispose of water.
Last summer, Connor visited Thailand. While driving through the poor areas, he noticed that the people were wearing dirty, rugged clothing and torn up sandals. It really changed the way he saw the world, and he wanted to help the people who were living those conditions.
When Connor told the team his story, it touched all of our hearts and then we too wanted to help the poor people.
So, the team decided to incorporate refugees with this year’s water project.
The problem that we decided to solve was the lack of clean water in the refugee camps in Bangladesh or other surrounding areas that are populated by the people from Myanmar.
In these camps, the residents have to walk for miles to get to their water that comes from muddy lakes. They have to bathe, drink, cook, and wash their belongings in the same source of water every day. As you can imagine, there are tons of diseases in these camps because of the poor conditions these people are living in.
Other ways that people have solved this problem are to drill wells, setup rain collecting barrels, provide filters, or deliver bottled water, which is too expensive and dangerous.
 Our solution is called H2Ouse. H2Ouse is better because it provides shelter, as well as a renewable water source. It also saves the refugee's from having to walk miles to get their water.
With cleaner water, we can help decrease the chance of catching diseases, and help the refugees live a happier and healthier life.
We are planning to use stackable plastic water storage bricks to build a shelter that catches rain. H2Ouse will be a safe way to store water, unlike dirty, unclean, water storage. It will improve their everyday life by not drinking out of the same water they bathe in.
There is a water brick commercially available that is used store water. We plan to modify the design to allow the water to drain from brick to brick. The plastic we will use to produce the bricks will be infused with a tiny amount of silver and magnesium to help control bacteria. They'll be similar in size and construction, and we think it will be about the same cost to produce.
We plan to build a working 3D scale model of what H2Ouse will look like. It will be a 1/5 scale model of the H2Ouse which is six feet wide, nine feet long, and six feet high. We'll be using the water bricks, bamboo, and tarp to make the actual shelter. The bamboo is naturally found in the location of the camps. H2Ouse will hold about 700 gallons of clean water that can be used for cooking, cleaning, and drinking.  
Weatherbase.com says that the average rainfall in Bangladesh is about 10 in. per month. We've calculated that in the rainy months, we will collect up to 1200 gallons of water in each shelter. According to The UN Refugee Agency, the average refugee needs around 5 gallons of water per day to survive. This means the average family of four needs about 600 gallons to survive each month.
Based off the cost of the commercially available water bricks, we believe that the manufacturing price will be about $4.00 per brick. It'll take about 200 bricks to build 1 shelter.
 1 complete H2Ouse will fit on two standard palates, and 20 shelters will fit in a standard 40ft ISO shipping container. We've determined that it will cost $575.00 to ship a container over sea.
 The total cost of a manufactured and delivered shelter from Shanghai to Bangladesh is around $870.00 and it is possible that we can reduce that cost if we are able to locally manufacture them.

Its purpose was to establish tribal ownership of cultural items either discovered or excavated (from archaeological excavation) on federal or tribal land (public not private land). NAGPRA states that Native American human remains and the associated funerary objects belong to lineal descendants. If lineal descendants cannot be identified (i.e. culturally unidentifiable objects) then the remains and objects, along with sacred and funerary objects and objects of cultural patrimony belong to the tribe whose land the objects and remains were found or they belong to the tribe having the closest known relationship to them. The process of returning our ancestors and our objects is called repatriation. In order for ancestors and objects to come home, museums and institutions will either contact the tribe directly or the tribe can contact that museum or institution who may have objects or ancestors. A consultation meeting is then scheduled in order for both entities to see the objects or ancestors in question. After consultation, the repatriation process can begin. Once ancestors or items are returned, the tribe can then choose to do with them what they wish. If there are objects or ancestors found in an archaeological excavation then the tribe should be notified and reburial or repatriation can begin. By creating an institution such as Lakota Dream Museum it makes it easier for Lakota and Great Plains ancestors and objects to be returned to the community. A museum that is run for and by Lakota people will allow the museum to facilitatethe repatriation process, taking the burden (financial, spiritual and emotional) away from individual tribal members. <br/>-Emily C.

<p>We begin projects by asking “Where can we make the biggest difference?” Now, our sights are set on Israel/Palestine where peace seems further away than ever.  Our work has shown us that the one sure way to bring peace closer is to amplify the work of grassroots visionaries via the resources of our diverse international network of creators.</p>

<p>Born as a refugee to a political family, Ali Abu Awwad was arrested as a teenager during the First Intifada and spent four years in an Israeli prison where he learned about non-violence while studying the lives of Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi.  After being released due to the Oslo Accord, Ali was badly wounded and his brother violently killed during the Second Intifada.  A fortuitous meeting with Israelis who had also lost loved ones in the conflict, set the stage for the founding of Roots.</p>
<p><strong><i>Peace is where opposing truths can fit together in one place.</i></strong></p>
<p>In 2014, Ali was instrumental in bringing together two groups who would normally never meet -- Palestinian activists and Israeli rabbis from the settlements in the West Bank. Inspired by the transformation that occurred with interaction and dialogue, they co-founded Roots and began the courageous work of finding common ground and forging a way towards equal rights, justice and prosperity on the land both feel a deep connection to.</p>
<p>Shortly after founding Roots, Ali began building Karama (meaning dignity) Center on the land his family has owned for four generations. Karama is in Area C which accounts for nearly 60% of the West Bank’s land. Under Israeli control, upwards of 500,000 Israelis live in 125 settlements and 100 outposts.  Israel is constantly building here, but it is virtually prohibited for Palestinians which makes the creation of Karama Center even more remarkable.</p>

<p>The Peace Project will work hand-in-hand with Ali and a team of designers, architects and local tradesmen to master plan and transform the existing utilitarian buildings into a holistic campus where peace initiatives and healing work can thrive.  Karama Center will express the richness of Palestinian heritage and culture, and inspire international visitors (currently 500 - 700 per week) to believe peace is achievable.  Arts &amp; Crafts from Palestine’s rich pool of talent will be showcased and sold to visitors to help sustain local artisans, fund Karama, and spread the message of unity once visitors return home from the Holy Land.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Fandom Forward is dedicating ourselves to showing up for immigrants, fighting for the climate, engaging emerging activists, and much more. 2021 is a year of re-birth for the organization, so we're using today as a change to explore our vault of vintage items, campaign knick knacks, and other lost treasures for supporters to explore and bring home today!</p>
<p>For 16 years, we’ve proven the power of story to inspire and drive change. Today, dark forces tell stories designed to drive fear, hate, and hopelessness, but Fandom Forward is helping to mobilize fans to imagine and create a better story - one grounded in leadership, love, and equality for all.  </p>
<h3>The Power of Story</h3>
<p>Fandom Forward is a game-changing, innovative organization that uses the power of pop culture to transform fans into activists. We bring community organizing to online and offline fan spaces and channel fans’ creativity, passion, and critical thinking into making real world change. By pivoting people to action using the stories they already love, Fandom Forward provides fun, hopeful ways for fans to become long-term activists. </p>
<p>Our method is working: Fandom Forward has over 100 chapters and 90K members in all 50 U.S. states and 30 countries. These members are largely young women and LGBTQIA+ folks, and nearly 60% had never before been involved in activism prior to joining Fandom Forward! In the last year, Fandom Forward has trained nearly 2,000 emerging activists, engaged over 100,000 first-time voters, launched three new virtual conferences for fan activists, and led dozens of actions for climate justice, immigrant rights, and trans rights!</p>
<p>In 2021 and 2022, we're planning big things: two new campaigns around mental health and abolition, a new supportive coaching program for our Chapter Organizers, and the launch of the first ever coalition for fan organizers (in partnership with Black Girls Create and Pop Culture Collaborative)!

<p>The Ferguson tragedy, the deaths of Mike Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, the indictment of 18 Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies by the FBI for excessive force, the resignation of L.A. Sheriff LeRoy Baca in the wake of countless police brutality charges, the imprisonment of L.A. Sheriff's deputies for interfering with police brutality case witnesses...  There are far too many instances of rights deprivation, excessive force, police brutality and cover-up. We've chosen to take a stand, and, just as importantly, we've identified how to do it effectively. Please stand with us.</p>
<p>If not us, who?</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>The Problem (until now)</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Police brutality is a wide-reaching issue in the United States and throughout the world with deep roots in economic and racial inequity, militarization of federal and local law enforcement agencies, the increasing use of law enforcement to collect revenue for bankrupt states and a bankrupt nation, and a house-of-cards economy that is showing signs of collapse--with the poorest among us the first to fall. No crowdfunding campaign can solve the entire issue. However, we've identified a specific problem where a little capital can effect significant impact on the greater issue.</p>
<p>The specific problem we seek to overcome with the Bad Cop No Donut campaign is the financial barrier to entry for victims bringing suit against police brutality offenders. Even if a lawyer takes a case on contingency basis and the victim/plaintiff is eligible for a low income waiver of court costs, there are still hard costs of suit that often cannot be paid. Expert witnesses and depositions primarily. Expert Witnesses cost $5-10,000, and court reporters for depositions are about $2,000 a day. So even if a victim of police brutality is willing to stand up, which is rare enough, the case dies if he or she doesn't have the $10-20,000 to cover the hard costs inherent in the discovery phase of any successful lawsuit. Thus the majority of offenders escape accountability... and they and their fellow officers continue to believe they can get away with excessive force... and the beatings go on... and the problem grows worse every day nationwide and throughout the ""free"" world.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>This campaign creates a not-for-profit private express trust and trust fund specifically to pay legal costs necessary to check the encroaching police state, demand accountability from public servants who use excessive force, and help stop the rampant police brutality problem. We start by financing one specific case currently in U.S. Federal Court, Ninth District: Alexander Vago v. County of Los Angeles et al, Case # 2:13-cv-00868-DMG-RZ. We believe this is a winnable case. How large the judgment or settlement will be, no one knows, but any judgment or settlement will include a recovery of costs of suit, which includes the funds raised here. When we recover the costs through settlement or judgment, we will then use the same money to fund other cases again and again. If we raise more here than required for the Vago case, which we hope to do with your generosity and assistance by spreading it through social media and the press, we will also fund other cases in parallel to the Vago case. And if this campaign is successful, we will use it as proof of concept and run a bigger campaign next in order to fund as many cases as we can and make a significant impact on this growing problem.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Police brutality is on the increase for a number of reasons: 1) growing disregard for the unalienable rights of the people, especially minorities and people without money, 2) dehumanization that takes place based on economic status and/or race, 3) belief by many law enforcement officers that they can get away with excessive force, and 4) too many instances where the offenders do get away with brutal acts because it's too difficult and costly for the average man or woman to successfully punish them through the court system.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Bad Cop No Donut starts with successfully punishing offenders in order to regain a respect for our rights. In order to bring successful law suits to hold the offenders accountable, many victims need the type of financial resources we are creating with this private trust fund so they can successfully prosecute the offenders. If we, with your help, financially support the victims to prosecute the offenders, removing the financial hurdle that quashes most police brutality cases in favor of the offenders, we take away the ability of the offenders to get away with their offenses. As we successfully prosecute offenders, we also reduce the perception that offenders can get away with the use of excessive force. As this perception changes in the wake of increased threat of just retribution, the rights of the people will once again become primarily important to law enforcement officers, as they should be. If nothing else, officers will at least know they risk losing their career and livelihood if they don't respect your rights.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where Your Dollars Go &amp; What They Will Do</h3> <p>Financial details:</p> <ul> <li>The first order of business is to win one important case. After that, we'll use the same money (plus additional funds raised), to fund more and more cases.</li>
<li>To win the first case identified for this effort, Alexander Vago v.

<h3>The Vago Case</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The first case we've identified for this effort, Alexander Vago v. County of Los Angeles et al, Case # 2:13-cv-00868-DMG-RZ, is a Federal Court civil rights and excessive force case arising from egregious police brutality perpetrated by two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies. We have fully vetted and researched this case and conclude on examination of the facts that it is a winnable case which presents an opportunity to set an example for law enforcement officers everywhere, hopefully just the first of many to come.</p>
<p>Selection of this first case was very different from the selection of future cases. This case was brought to our attention and gave us the idea to create this campaign and its resulting trust fund. We didn't know Mike Brown or Tamir Rice. We didn't know Alexander Vago either, but Mr. Vago came to us for help, and we decided to help. Then we chose to turn it into something bigger. The next victims we assist, once we have the funds to help and once we're a known source of assistance, will come from all over. The trust fund will financially enable anyone, regardless of economic status, to hold law enforcement officers accountable in court, helping to assure nobody can be profiled by police as a non-threat to their jobs and dehumanized because of economic status. And we see this as a path to economic justice and its direct and inextricably connected relative, racial justice. </p>
<p>Alexander Vago was an hourly wage worker in a natural foods store, an ordinary guy, who is now unable to work and on disability since the incident described below. He was probably profiled as a low income nobody, and the Sheriff's deputies thought they could get away with dehumanizing and brutalizing Mr. Vago based on his economic status. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Summary of the facts alleged in the case:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>On May 15, 2011, Alexander Vago was brutally beaten by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Deputies Brent Bunch and Doug Duvall at a routine traffic stop for a minor traffic infraction. Mr. Vago was merely a passenger in the back seat of a car. He was unarmed and had no criminal record. There are multiple witnesses who will state under oath that he was calm and didn't pose any threat to the officers or anyone else. He never lifted a hand to fight back or even to defend himself. He didn't move. Nevertheless, the two deputies took turns tasing and stunning him in the head and neck about a dozen times until he keeled over in his seat half unconscious, then they maced his eyes at immediate range. Then they beat him with batons, meanwhile making jokes like, ""Did you see him kick me?"", as they proceeded to beat him in feigned retaliation for the mock acts they invented in their jokes. They beat him repeatedly in the head, the torso and the legs with batons. The attack was so severe that Mr. Vago was hospitalized, the injuries still persist today, and he is now physically and mentally unable to work and dependent on state disability coverage.</p>
<p>The photos below were taken of a few of Alex Vago's injuries three days after he was tased, stunned, maced, beaten and falsely imprisoned by L.A. County Sheriff's deputies and after having been treated at two hospitals for his injuries.<br/></p>

<p>This civil rights action seeks compensatory and punitive damages for deprivation of rights and serious injuries received by Mr. Vago resulting from the May 15, 2011 roadside traffic stop. It is the Plaintiff's highest intention that the Defendants will compensate Mr. Vago and pay punitive damages and that the two offending deputies will never work again in law enforcement.</p>

<p>The entire case file is public in the Federal Court, Ninth District, Case No. 2:13-cv-00868-DMG-RZ. The parties are presently engaged in discovery proceedings. Mr. Vago will need $13,000 to complete discovery, as itemized above, or else the case will not proceed and these offenders will walk away without reprimand or accountability for their actions. Please help us ensure this will not happen this time.</p>

<p>The money raised from this campaign goes directly to Alexander Vago to fund his case. If we reach our goal in time, he will have what he needs to proceed with discovery and depose witnesses and the offending officers.

<p>Nothing is certain but death and taxes. Judges are like a box of chocolates; You never know what you're going to get. We're well aware that anything can happen in court. However, what's been happening to date is that only well-off individuals can afford to bring suit and cover the hard costs of discovery, so the cops routinely get away with police brutality. That needs to end, we see a way to significantly curtail it, and with your help we believe we can make a real impact.</p>
<p>The fact is... we need to win this first case. If we lose this first case, we may not have much of a trust fund for other cases. That said, we like our odds in the Vago case. We don't believe the offenders in this case can wiggle out of what they've done. Their lawyers have already tried repeatedly to get the case dismissed over the past two years, and they now realize it is not going away. We intend to hold the offenders and their employers fully accountable.</p>

The Ferguson tragedy, the deaths of Mike Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, the indictment of 18 Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies by the FBI for excessive force, the resignation of L.A. Sheriff LeRoy Baca in the wake of countless police brutality charges, the imprisonment of L.A. Sheriff's deputies for interfering with police brutality case witnesses...  There are far too many instances of rights deprivation, excessive force, police brutality and cover-up. We've chosen to take a stand, and, just as importantly, we've identified how to do it effectively. Please stand with us.
If not us, who?



The Problem (until now)

Police brutality is a wide-reaching issue in the United States and throughout the world with deep roots in economic and racial inequity, militarization of federal and local law enforcement agencies, the increasing use of law enforcement to collect revenue for bankrupt states and a bankrupt nation, and a house-of-cards economy that is showing signs of collapse--with the poorest among us the first to fall. No crowdfunding campaign can solve the entire issue. However, we've identified a specific problem where a little capital can effect significant impact on the greater issue.
The specific problem we seek to overcome with the Bad Cop No Donut campaign is the financial barrier to entry for victims bringing suit against police brutality offenders. Even if a lawyer takes a case on contingency basis and the victim/plaintiff is eligible for a low income waiver of court costs, there are still hard costs of suit that often cannot be paid. Expert witnesses and depositions primarily. Expert Witnesses cost $5-10,000, and court reporters for depositions are about $2,000 a day. So even if a victim of police brutality is willing to stand up, which is rare enough, the case dies if he or she doesn't have the $10-20,000 to cover the hard costs inherent in the discovery phase of any successful lawsuit. Thus the majority of offenders escape accountability... and they and their fellow officers continue to believe they can get away with excessive force... and the beatings go on... and the problem grows worse every day nationwide and throughout the ""free"" world.

The Solution
This campaign creates a not-for-profit private express trust and trust fund specifically to pay legal costs necessary to check the encroaching police state, demand accountability from public servants who use excessive force, and help stop the rampant police brutality problem. We start by financing one specific case currently in U.S. Federal Court, Ninth District: Alexander Vago v. County of Los Angeles et al, Case # 2:13-cv-00868-DMG-RZ. We believe this is a winnable case. How large the judgment or settlement will be, no one knows, but any judgment or settlement will include a recovery of costs of suit, which includes the funds raised here. When we recover the costs through settlement or judgment, we will then use the same money to fund other cases again and again. If we raise more here than required for the Vago case, which we hope to do with your generosity and assistance by spreading it through social media and the press, we will also fund other cases in parallel to the Vago case. And if this campaign is successful, we will use it as proof of concept and run a bigger campaign next in order to fund as many cases as we can and make a significant impact on this growing problem.

The Impact
Police brutality is on the increase for a number of reasons: 1) growing disregard for the unalienable rights of the people, especially minorities and people without money, 2) dehumanization that takes place based on economic status and/or race, 3) belief by many law enforcement officers that they can get away with excessive force, and 4) too many instances where the offenders do get away with brutal acts because it's too difficult and costly for the average man or woman to successfully punish them through the court system.
Bad Cop No Donut starts with successfully punishing offenders in order to regain a respect for our rights. In order to bring successful law suits to hold the offenders accountable, many victims need the type of financial resources we are creating with this private trust fund so they can successfully prosecute the offenders. If we, with your help, financially support the victims to prosecute the offenders, removing the financial hurdle that quashes most police brutality cases in favor of the offenders, we take away the ability of the offenders to get away with their offenses. As we successfully prosecute offenders, we also reduce the perception that offenders can get away with the use of excessive force. As this perception changes in the wake of increased threat of just retribution, the rights of the people will once again become primarily important to law enforcement officers, as they should be. If nothing else, officers will at least know they risk losing their career and livelihood if they don't respect your rights.   Where Your Dollars Go & What They Will Do Financial details:  The first order of business is to win one important case. After that, we'll use the same money (plus additional funds raised), to fund more and more cases.
To win the first case identified for this effort, Alexander Vago v. County of Los Angeles et al, Federal Court Case # 2:13-cv-00868-DMG-RZ, we will need $13,000, as follows: $5,000 for a professional witness and $2,000 each for 4 court reporters to record the depositions of 4 witnesses. Every cent up to the $14,000 goal, after Indiegogo fees, will go directly to Mr. Vago to cover these costs. Any amount raised above and beyond the goal of this campaign will be forwarded to a private trust fund to be managed as a private not-for-profit trust by the trustees of the Global Trust Education Network (GTEN.org, see our information below). Other court cases will be immediately considered for assistance, vetted and researched, and the funds will benefit other plaintiffs with strong police brutality cases. If we fall short of the stated goal of at least $14,000, the Trustees of GTEN have pledged to assist in making up the shortfall to assure the success of this first important case win, so no donation will go to waste.
Every successful plaintiff, starting with Mr. Vago, will not only return the principal to the trust fund from recovery of court costs (to be used again and again) but will also pledge a portion of his or her awarded judgment or settlement to the trust fund to increase the trust fund value to help future victims. The trust fund will grow with every victory in court.
Your one-time contribution will fund an ever-increasing number of court cases, for an ever-increasing number of brave individuals to stand up for ALL of us and protect our unalienable rights in the face of the encroaching police state we are experiencing today.
If this crowdfunding campaign is successful, we will launch another campaign in the coming year to increase the capacity of the trust fund. We will seek, with your help and the help of others, to put a stop to police brutality across the United States of America and around the ""free"" world. We intend that the next campaign will also include fund raising for the re-education of law enforcement personnel regarding the unalienable rights of people. If anyone selects the $20,000 contribution perk on this present campaign, we'll already have a jump on this education initiative.    
The Vago Case


The first case we've identified for this effort, Alexander Vago v. County of Los Angeles et al, Case # 2:13-cv-00868-DMG-RZ, is a Federal Court civil rights and excessive force case arising from egregious police brutality perpetrated by two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies. We have fully vetted and researched this case and conclude on examination of the facts that it is a winnable case which presents an opportunity to set an example for law enforcement officers everywhere, hopefully just the first of many to come.
Selection of this first case was very different from the selection of future cases. This case was brought to our attention and gave us the idea to create this campaign and its resulting trust fund. We didn't know Mike Brown or Tamir Rice. We didn't know Alexander Vago either, but Mr. Vago came to us for help, and we decided to help. Then we chose to turn it into something bigger. The next victims we assist, once we have the funds to help and once we're a known source of assistance, will come from all over. The trust fund will financially enable anyone, regardless of economic status, to hold law enforcement officers accountable in court, helping to assure nobody can be profiled by police as a non-threat to their jobs and dehumanized because of economic status. And we see this as a path to economic justice and its direct and inextricably connected relative, racial justice. 
Alexander Vago was an hourly wage worker in a natural foods store, an ordinary guy, who is now unable to work and on disability since the incident described below. He was probably profiled as a low income nobody, and the Sheriff's deputies thought they could get away with dehumanizing and brutalizing Mr. Vago based on his economic status. 


Summary of the facts alleged in the case:

On May 15, 2011, Alexander Vago was brutally beaten by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Deputies Brent Bunch and Doug Duvall at a routine traffic stop for a minor traffic infraction. Mr. Vago was merely a passenger in the back seat of a car. He was unarmed and had no criminal record.

The photos below were taken of a few of Alex Vago's injuries three days after he was tased, stunned, maced, beaten and falsely imprisoned by L.A. County Sheriff's deputies and after having been treated at two hospitals for his injuries.




This civil rights action seeks compensatory and punitive damages for deprivation of rights and serious injuries received by Mr. Vago resulting from the May 15, 2011 roadside traffic stop. It is the Plaintiff's highest intention that the Defendants will compensate Mr. Vago and pay punitive damages and that the two offending deputies will never work again in law enforcement.

<p>Driven by poverty to seek employment in Hong Kong, more than 320,000 (primarily women) domestic workers now toil in private residences hidden from public view and subjected to varying forms of abuse. Due to the hidden nature of this phenomenon, the extent of forced labour in Hong Kong (HK) is unknown. </p>
<p>After volunteering for three <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">years </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">with a HK NGO providing legal advice to migrant domestic workers, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I became convinced that many of the workers who were seeking assistance were in fact victims of human trafficking and specifically victims of forced labour. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>I am now determined to seek a PhD (Law) focused on Human Rights so that I am better prepared to continue helping this marginalized community. I am currently in my second year at the University of York, UK and I will return to Hong Kong this month for my field research.</p>
<p></p>Based on my experience, I saw first hand that many of the migrant domestic workers who leave their employers due to abusive working conditions are forced into conciliation with their employers when they make claims for their final wages and entitlements upon termination. This practice results in workers settling claims for much less than their contractual entitlement.  </div><div>While the circumstances of these cases are treated as a simple labour disputes, my view is that they are in fact cases of forced labour, a violation of human rights and a breach of Hong Kong's obligations to the Basic Law of Hong Kong and International Covenants.</div><div>
<p> I will spend six months working closely with local HK charitable and non-profit organizations as well as migrant workers determining and documenting the extent of forced labour within the  migrant domestic worker community.  At the same time, I will highlight that the conciliation process as applied is inconsistent with Hong Kong's obligations to  protect human rights, prevent abuses and punish violators. Additionally, the research will provide a solid foundation for advocating for changes in policy, practice and law. </p>

</div></div>","Summary
Driven by poverty to seek employment in Hong Kong, more than 320,000 (primarily women) domestic workers now toil in private residences hidden from public view and subjected to varying forms of abuse. Due to the hidden nature of this phenomenon, the extent of forced labour in Hong Kong (HK) is unknown. 
After volunteering for three years with a HK NGO providing legal advice to migrant domestic workers, I became convinced that many of the workers who were seeking assistance were in fact victims of human trafficking and specifically victims of forced labour.  
I am now determined to seek a PhD (Law) focused on Human Rights so that I am better prepared to continue helping this marginalized community. I am currently in my second year at the University of York, UK and I will return to Hong Kong this month for my field research.
Based on my experience, I saw first hand that many of the migrant domestic workers who leave their employers due to abusive working conditions are forced into conciliation with their employers when they make claims for their final wages and entitlements upon termination. This practice results in workers settling claims for much less than their contractual entitlement.  While the circumstances of these cases are treated as a simple labour disputes, my view is that they are in fact cases of forced labour, a violation of human rights and a breach of Hong Kong's obligations to the Basic Law of Hong Kong and International Covenants.
 I will spend six months working closely with local HK charitable and non-profit organizations as well as migrant workers determining and documenting the extent of forced labour within the  migrant domestic worker community.  At the same time, I will highlight that the conciliation process as applied is inconsistent with Hong Kong's obligations to  protect human rights, prevent abuses and punish violators. Additionally, the research will provide a solid foundation for advocating for changes in policy, practice and law. 
The International Labour Organization estimates that there are over 21 million victims of forced labour globally with over half being women and girls. Almost 19 million are exploited by private individuals, with domestic work being one of the most exploitative sectors.
Having had the opportunity to meet some of these women and understand first hand their struggles woke me to how unaware we are to injustice all around us and it has changed how I look at my life of privilege.  I am determined to take this topic out of the shadows by adding their plight to the ongoing dialogue on forced labor.Poverty is one of the most challenging issues of our time. My project will not, and is not intended to cure poverty, but it might help a small group of Migrant Domestic Workers realize their dreams of caring for their families and being paid fairly for their hard work.    Funding I have self funded my education but this research phase will be costly as the cost of living in Hong Kong is very high. My goal is to raise $30,000 in funding supplement my personal expenditures towards travel, accommodation and living expenses for 6-8 months in Hong Kong. The bulk of expenses will cover accommodation which averages $2,000 per month ($12 -16,000) for a small serviced apartment.   The Impact In 2011 I visited a woman in a small village in Indonesia.

<h3>Who Are We and What Are We Here For</h3>
<p>Aloha!</p>
<p> Jaquelynn Jeanne Collier and Raisa Klyne here! We’re just two girls who grew up as dear friends in Hawaii immersing themselves with every theatre opportunity our community had to offer. We both left for college in Canada and NYC, and gained generous opportunities that broadened our careers in Marketing and Theatre, respectively. In 2017, and coincidentally only months apart, we both moved back to the Big Island!</p>
<p>When we returned, we knew we needed to put our skills and craft into helping our community, and something we knew needed attention is the reproductive justice system within our community. Our island's population is at 186,738 and always growing. Since 2015, we have had ZERO free, reliable, and 100% confidential clinics. This does not sit well with us.</p>
<p>That being said, we have decided to put together a production of Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues this August in West Hawaii! We hope this production follows our mission to collaborate with our community by creating a work of theatre that will educate, inspire, and empower women and allies of any diversity. For this event, our additional mission is to raise $5,000 for Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii (PPVNH) &amp; Planned Parenthood Greater Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands (PPGNHI) to increase the sexual education programs, free and safe consultations, and advocacy to fight for reproductive justice.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While our production of The Vagina Monologues is undergoing rehearsals for our one-night benefit performance on August 11th, 2018,  we want to go above and beyond for an organization that has done so much for so many women! We have been blessed enough to work with an incredible crew of female Big Island artists who have pledged thousands of dollars worth of merchandise to help raise additional funds for Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>With every donation, you will receive a bundle of curated goods from artists and artisans from all over the Big Island! The Pledge Packs are as follows:</p>
<p>Pins &amp; Stickers</p>
<p>$10 - The Vagina Warrior Pin Pack</p>
<p>$10 - The Cosmic and Wild Sticker Pack</p>
<p>$10 - The Nature Lover Sticker Pack</p>

<p>$25 - The Flower Power Art Pack</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Planned Parenthood has been providing safe and affordable reproductive health care for more than 100 years. Their dedication to women and families across the nation - and soon, across the world! - has been a pillar for women's right to access to reproductive healthcare for generations. While for many years, Planned Parenthood operated on the Big Island of Hawaii, lack of funding and a handful of other factors forced the two clinics on the island to close their doors in 2015. Since then, women of the Big Island have had little to no access to affordable reproductive healthcare. Our mission is to change that. </p>
<p>Our team spoke with representatives of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii  (PPVNH) as well as Planned Parenthood Greater Northwest and The Hawaiian Islands (PPGNH) to discuss the most efficient way to aid our local women. After a bit of research, we learned that PPGNHI has been working on this issue for some time. While the state of Hawaii will have a Planned Parenthood clinic open again this year, the clinic will only be open on the island of Oahu, leaving residents of the other seven islands with no access. This is where we can help! </p>
<p>PPGNHI has put together a program through which patrons who are not on Oahu can receive the care they need with the help of vouchers. These vouchers include airfare and accommodations for those who are in need of health care but cannot afford to fly out to the clinic on Oahu. Our campaign's aim is to raise funds to help pay for these vouchers so that women of the Big Island who seek healthcare will have the opportunity to receive it without having to worry about having the funds.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood's work doesn't stop there. In an effort to broaden their accessibility, Planned Parenthood has launched a mobile app that brings confidential and convenient STD testing and treatment to your doorstep. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>While Planned Parenthood has made great strides - made possible by the hard work of Planned Parenthood Votes - we are still in a tough fight. We understand that the real change needs to come from legislation and the only way to do that is to remain educated on current issues and vigilant in protecting Women's rights. That's where Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii comes in. The Big Island severely lacks access to reproductive health care and the fight to get our clinics back is a long battle. These funds will go towards the advocacy of reproductive justice.</span></p>

Twelve of the state’s boldest and most innovative females will be put on a pedestal (literally) and made into individual statues.We are partnering with the Women's Legacy Project to help fund the monuments and bring this project to life. Help us create a physical reminder of the power of the past to inspire future generations to continue to enable women to succeed! How Can I Help?
Don't just read about history, be part of shaping it!
We are helping to raise as much of the $3 million needed as possible and our first goal is $30,000.
There are 2 specific ways you can help support this campaign.
1) Donate to help us commemorate these 12 iconic women while honoring a woman in your life too! Just in time for Mother’s Day!

This Sounds Great, But Who Are You?

We’re the 2019 Commemoration / American Evolution! Our mission is to highlight the significance and modern relevance of several important events that occurred in Virginia in 1619. One of these is the role of women. These events strongly influenced the development of the colony and shaped the foundation of the United States.
Starting now through 2019 we’ll be having multiple digital and live events throughout the state and country. Check our website for all the details - americanevolution2019.com.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Zakkiyyah Nazeeh and I have some exciting news to share with you. I am going to be the recipient of the 2017 Women of Distinction award for my work with women, young women, and girls.</p>
<p>This award is very special to me, to be recognized and honored for the wonderful work I have done over the last 25 years. My career goals have been to provide support through counseling with women who are incarcerated, homeless, addicted to substances, physically, emotionally and sexual abused.</p>
<p>Many of the women and young women believe their current situation is hopeless and they have no alternatives to live a productive life. I have been able to help them look at their lives through a different colored lens. The lens shows them they are strong, worthy, intelligent and resourceful women. I share my motto with them:</p>
<p><strong>You are #1, treat yourself as such...</strong></p>

<p>I am a member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated and I am the Northern California State Director. In this position, I have had the opportunity to provide services to women, young women and girls in our communities who need support, and most of all I have the opportunity to be a mentor to some of the young women in <strong>Zeta Phi Beta Sorority</strong>, Incorporated.</p>
<p>Celebrating Women International is a non-profit organization founded in 2013. The organization aims to mobilize women across the globe to honor, recognize and celebrate the contribution of women for their leadership capabilities to assist other women to thrive in the world so they can lead productive lives.</p>
<p>Oh, I almost forgot the award ceremony will be held December 2, 2017, in Nassau the Bahama. Within the next 45 days, I need your support to raise funds in order that my granddaughter and I may travel and receive the 2017  Women of Distinction Award.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In my earlier message, I shared one of the reasons why receiving the Woman of Distinction award is so important to me.  I would now like to share another reason this award is important to me.</p>
<p>I am the first woman in my family who graduated from college and received both an undergraduate and graduate degree. My granddaughter Marshawna is the 4th generation of women in my family who has completed her undergraduate degree in Physiology.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498146681/zqkhn7pfmlrlqybwejw7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My granddaughter and I have always had a very strong relationship, and she has been my companion from birth. I recall one of my most exciting moments was when she attended the ceremony to receive my Master’s Degree.  Marshawna was 2 years old, holding my hand tightly as she and I walked across the stage to receive my Master’s Degree. That was a proud day for me and to have my granddaughter by my side witnessing the moment was the cherry on top.</p>
<p> As we left the stage and returned to our seat, Marshawna asked, ""what did you win""? I shared with her; I did not win anything but rather received an award for my studies in school. Well, at 2 years she did not really understand what I was saying, but she smiled and went to sleep. She continued to attend many meetings, social events, and ceremonies with me.</p>
<p>Marshawna plans to attend nursing school and become a Nurse Practitioner. Her focus is to assist young pregnant women who may not have access to adequate health care to ensure a healthy and thriving child. I am blessed to see my legacy continues, as Marshawna is also a member of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated.  I am passing her the torch so she can continue the work of supporting women and girls.</p>
<p>With your generous contribution, Marshawna will again be able to hold my hand tightly as we walk across the stage to receive the 2017 Women of Distinction Award in Nassau, the Bahamas on December 2<sup>nd</sup>. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Elizabeth M. Fink fought for human rights for disenfranchised people of all walks of life, most prominently as a member of the Attica Brothers Legal Defense team. In her 23 year struggle for recognition for the people killed, injured, and tortured at Attica prison she was continually presented with challenges from state authorities regarding incriminating evidence. The evidence was routinely moved, hidden, or destroyed, while authorities claimed it had been lost.</p>
<p>Despite their efforts she discovered a trove of material, including:</p>
<p><strong>1. A complete video recording of the assault made by a guard in the prison.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Photographs of the yard immediately after the assault that include clear depictions of torture. </strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Autopsy photos proving that every man who died at Attica, including the hostages, was killed by bullets fired by the New York State Police.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Complete recordings of important video documents, including the <i>McKay Commission Report</i>, the documentary film <i>Ghosts of Attica</i>, television appearances by Fink and former inmate Frank ""Big Black"" Smith, as well as Fink's final on-camera interview before her death.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the photographs from the archive were recently provided free of charge to historian <a href=""http://heatherannthompson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heather Ann Thompson</a> for her book <i><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Water-Attica-Prison-Uprising/dp/0375423222"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blood in the Water</a></i>. Thompson worked with Fink while researching the book and describes a similar experience dealing with the State of New York.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Prior to her death in September 2015, Fink began overseeing the processing of her archive for digital distribution to all interested parties. She wanted to make the collection freely available to the public in perpetuity, so no one could claim it had been 'lost' ever again.</span></p>
<p>The Fink estate is now tasked with seeing this project to completion, a goal we intend to reach in 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds will go to purchase specialty equipment needed for digitizing slides, a less expensive option than obtaining outside services. We also need preservation items like protective sleeves for the photographs, post-production services for processing hours of VHS tapes, and hard drives for distribution of the material for website construction, researchers, and journalists. Money will be used to establish a permanent online portal for access to the complete archive, including commentary on the material from members of the Attica Brothers Legal Defense team, and testimonials from surviving Attica Brothers.</p>
<p>Documentary filmmaker and archivist <a href=""https://twitter.com/fifthcolumnfilm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Hull</a> was a personal friend of Fink's who she trusted to handle the digitization, organization and distribution of her archive. He was working on the archive with Fink until her death and has continued with the blessing of the estate, as well as her colleagues, friends and family. He has been working without pay, leading the project with his wife Morgan Foley, a longtime television news producer who was also a friend of Liz and frequent walker of her dog Sadie.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to make the material freely available to anyone who wants it, so there are no perks to hand out. We will include your name in a list of Made Possible By donors that will live with the archive, but any money we receive will go directly to preserving and spreading the word about this vital record of American history.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, funds will go to preserving the archive first and distributing it second, with the hopes that other interested parties will be able to publicize its importance and availability. Funds pledged above the goal amount will go to the production of an uncompromising documentary film based on Fink's final interview and her archive.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important because it remains the benchmark event for the use of state power against American civilians in the last hundred years. The version of events as reported by Richard Nixon and Nelson Rockefeller is in sharp contrast to the version told by medical examiners, National Guardsmen, prisoners, and others in the immediate aftermath. Anyone who deviated from the narrative told by the state was punished personally and professionally, but the evidence uncovered by Fink makes it clear they were being truthful.</p>
<p>In the conversation happening about policing in America today, we see echoes of the tactics used by powerful people in the past. There is a playbook of sorts that includes bullying, obfuscation, and repeating false narratives, all leading to hyperbolic threats of chaos and open war in the streets. Racial stereotypes and class divisions are key elements. Whether at Attica in 1971 or Ferguson in 2014, the study of these events can help us recognize them before they get out of hand, and hopefully reach more reasonable conclusions.</p>
<p>Making this evidence available to all Americans will help future generations hold their representatives to task, a vital duty in any democracy, and will help further vindicate those who are still living with this enormous event.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk we are facing is that the State of New York continues to deny that their employees engaged in systematic torture of inmates, despite the evidence present in this collection.</p>
<p>The primary challenge is in organizing the material and making it accessible to people with all levels of knowledge about the event. We intend to create guided tours of the material augmented with commentaries by people who experienced both the chaos in 1971, and the legal pathways that led from it. We feel this is the best way to introduce the subject matter to anyone who isn't familiar with the Attica uprising and how it resonates in today's fractured political world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Summary Overview</h3>
<p>Resist Assist is a new cause/company that I am creating for people throughout the US that cannot stand the current political climate but don't have time to get involved to call their senators, house of representatives, and other elected officials on a regular basis. Resist Assist provides personal assistants to call elected officials on your behalf to make sure your voices are being heard today, for a better tomorrow. </p>
<h3>Vision of Our Impact:</h3>
<p>Together we can rise up and fight for what is right. Fight for equality, each other &amp; standing up for those that can't fight for themselves (usually due to having less privilege). Together we can stop injustice, restore balance, and bring sanity back to our Democracy.</p>
<h3>Passion is Fueling this Effort</h3>
<p>I am passionate about launching an activism based business. I marched with people all over the world on Jan 21st to say that our voices will NOT be silenced. I believe in fundamental rights to equality, loving who you love, the right to have control over your own body - these are all fundamental human rights that no one or no government should be able to take away because of how we were born (gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or any other condition seen as ""other/less than”). Furthermore, I believe human rights extend to everyone regardless of where we were born or what your religion is.</p>
<p><strong>Who I am: </strong> My name is Logan, I am a successful entrepreneur who gives over 20% of my profits to charity every year (since 2007). I am a trusted startup advisor with previous experience as a corporate executive and I have an MBA. Besides giving generously to charity I volunteer my time and serve as a board member for LGBTQ organizations.</p>
<h3>Why This Matters So Much To Me Personally</h3>
<p>It is extremely important to me to get Resist Assist funded to help amplify people’s voices so that their elected representatives actually *hear* them. Resist Assist will help People like my mother who expressed that she was frustrated when she tried to call one time but couldn’t get through. She then proclaimed she doesn’t have time to make phone calls every week, even though she’s retired! </p>
<p>The conversation with my mother was my true “ah ha” moment to create Resist Assist to enable more people to have their voices heard in this frightening political climate. I deeply believe it is our patriotic duty to voice our dissent when our government takes un-American actions, actions a majority of people disapprove of. When our government passes unjust laws, it is our responsibility to let them know that We, the American People, are outraged by their governance. This is how democracy works. By funding Resist Assist, we will create a whole new way to get the voice of dissent (read: voice of reason) heard louder than ever before. My goal is to have Resist Assist empower thousands of more Americans to have their voices heard by their elected representatives. </p>
<p>As a member of the LGBTQ community in Austin, Texas, I am deeply passionate about LGBT rights, women’s rights, and human rights. I truly believe launching Resist Assist will help ensure these types of fights for equality will a better chance of prevailing when more open minded people can have their voices heard.</p>

Each child has an incredible life story entailing resilience and strength from traumatic and devastating experiences. From taking drugs so they do not feel cold at night to rummaging through piles of rubbish to find food; our boys some as young as 10 years old have had experiences that no child deserves to face.There isn’t a boy at the centre who doesn’t have a brother, cousin or friend that has died from street life either from starvation, overdosing on drugs, mob justice or being beaten to death by police in an effort to ‘clean up the streets’. There are a huge number of street children in Kenya, and as Global Hope is one of the only centres in the country rescuing and rehabilitating street boys it is an endless struggle. On a daily basis, we are informed of street boys facing near death experiences and children showing up to the gate with nowhere else to go, yet we are completely OUT OF SPACE.We cannot fit more in, already there are 3-4 boys in a single bed sharing a single blanket. Our rented buildings are all damaged and leak when it rains, making it difficult to eat meals, do homework and play games.The compound we currently reside in is too small for our needs and as we rent, every dollar we are forced to spend on repairs and maintenance feels like money wasted; not to mention our daily stress of being evicted if the landlord decides to demolish or sell. After many stressful days and sleepless nights, the Founder and the volunteers have come to the conclusion that the only option is to purchase land so that we are able to construct our own buildings.Our biggest and most difficult issue is we do not have money; some months it’s difficult to purchase food or pay school fees so without your help purchasing land is not an option for us.That’s why we are calling for support from all over the world, we know we can’t achieve our dream of purchasing land without your help and although it’s a big ask, the thought of all our boys becoming homeless, returning to the streets and facing the possibility of death is more than we can bare so we are COMMITTED to raising money for land.Some nights we sleep 6 or 7 boys to a single bunk bed, every morning we wake to prepare for school at 4am as we have one shower and one toilet that 110 children share and we live next to a sewage-contaminated river exposing all of us to typhoid and cholera; these diseases spread quickly and are deadly. We have found land, an incredible 1.5 acres just out of Ngong town and not far from our current centre for 15 million Kenyan shillings or $150,000 USD. For us, this amount of money is daunting and more than we’ve ever seen in our lifetimes, yet we are hopeful when we break it down: 150 people assisting to raise $1,000 or 300 people raising just $500 each in the 6 months seems absolutely achievable.The landlord has agreed to hold the land for 6 months ONLY to give us time to fundraise. Kenya is developing quickly, and other countries are buying huge amounts of land causing prices to rise quicker than ever. If we don’t act now, the possibility of owning our own land only becomes more difficult. We have all worked too hard to get to where we are, to only get this far.Please help us to ensure we can continue supporting our boys and many more street children for years to come. Every single dollar is so greatly appreciated!If you would like more information or are interested in assisting us to fundraise for land in a bigger way, please contact the Founder Joe Njoroge at globalhoperescuecentre777@gmail.com or the Australian Director Maddi Kent at maddi@eviegrace.orgMost donations are tax deductible, please contact info@eviegrace.org to receive a receipt.Thank you so much for your support!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>This year, Streetwise Opera ran With One Voice, the first summit for international organisations working with the homeless and the arts. WAYout was invited to attend, and created a beat which one of our musicians, Mash P, wrote and sang the chorus to 'Have You Ever Thought About?' . It's a song about homelessness addressed to world leaders. WAYout set up a makeshift studio at the venue and invited participants of the summit to contribute. Homeless people from Brazil, Peru, USA, Canada, India and other European countries took part; including Booth Centre, Dallas Street Choir, Bea Gardener , Riffraff, Theatre of the Oppressed NYC, Uma So Voz and Urban Voice Project so far. Others wanted to take the beat home and rehearse something and then send it.</li>
<li>We need your help to bring those contributions together and finish it and produce a video, to raise awareness of homelessness and support our hub in Sierra Leone. </li>
<li>WAYout is 10 years old and has worked with over 4,000 street and disadvantaged youth in Sierra Leone offering free training and facilities in music, filmmaking and the arts. We empower and give voice and provide skills that enable many to get work. WAYout was started by Hazel and Michael Chandler in response to the 70% unemployment in youth in Sierra Leone ten years ago and their own recognition and belief in the arts as a way of reaching young people who have been on the streets for years.</li>
<li>We've seen the life-changing benefits we can bring to street youth.  The WAYout studio is a safe haven replacing hopelessness, judgement and stigma with purpose, creativity, acceptance, training, homes, opportunity, facilities and inspiration.</li>
<li>The finished track will both raise awareness and challenge attitudes about homelessness around the world; be great promotion for the amazing work happening Internationally; and raise awareness and support for what WAYout does.</li>
</ul>
<p>HOW MUCH?</p>
<p>We want to raise £3000. This will be to gather up the recordings from around the world (cover their costs to send), mix and master the track and create a video for promotion. It will be used to raise awareness internationally to challenge the image of street and homeless people, and support our ongoing work. If we raise more than £3000, we will support WAYout's work and contribute to the organisations taking part.</p>

<p>The WAYout Story so far...</p>
<p>WAYout was founded in Sierra Leone in 2008 by Hazel and Michael Chandler. It came out of a documentary Hazel was making about street youth in Kenema and was set up to offer free training and facilities in media, music and arts to street and disadvantaged young people. Many were ex combatants and most were traumatised by the conflict and alienated from community and education.</p>
<p>We have worked with over 4,000 street and disadvantaged youth since then.</p>
<p>There was already a body of research about the power of the arts to engage and change lives but nothing quite prepares you for seeing that first hand. Long term, disengaged street youth could keep their cool and define what they wanted to do through music and movies; learning specific skills but also things like communication, literacy, co-operation, empathy and team work without even realising it. Again and again we have seen them reconnect with family or community after years apart, gain self esteem through creativity, develop the confidence to start or return to education or get jobs and find self respect and a sense of their own identity and ability. The magic happens the moment they go from hanging out and doing something because it is cool and they've nothing better to do, to the realisation that they could, perhaps, be somebody and achieve something. Then they get stuck in and start learning; proving to their communities, families and themselves, that they count, after years of being told they will never amount to anything.</p>
<p>WAYout has an open door policy and we encourage new members to find what they are good at rather than push them through a set pattern of training. We also offer grants to members who have been coming for at least six months and are serious about learning, to find them homes, for travel to reconnect with family or to return to education.</p>
<p>Our home -is a building in a compound that houses the two recording studios funded by the Joe Strummer Foundation, the photoshop room, two editing rooms and a dedicated women's room with a large outdoor space for teaching, dancing or rehearsing. We also have a smaller base in Kissi Town, the old refugee camp which is home to 22,000 people and still has no electricity supply or water.</p>
<p>WAYout members have made award winning films from comedy to awareness raising documentaries on subjects like Ebola, Illegal Fishing, FGM and women's rights- reaching audiences of hundreds of thousands. This year we produced our first feature film ""The Choice"" which is getting into international festivals. We also had an exhibition of photographs by members in London and produced our first poetry book ""Written Off"".</p>

BACKGROUND
""WAYout changed my life and music saved me. I was ashamed on the streets. Everyone rejected me but now I am a photographer and musician with a future"" - Nathaniel Sesay aka Mash P who wrote this song.
The WAYout Story so far...
WAYout was founded in Sierra Leone in 2008 by Hazel and Michael Chandler. It came out of a documentary Hazel was making about street youth in Kenema and was set up to offer free training and facilities in media, music and arts to street and disadvantaged young people. Many were ex combatants and most were traumatised by the conflict and alienated from community and education.
We have worked with over 4,000 street and disadvantaged youth since then.
There was already a body of research about the power of the arts to engage and change lives but nothing quite prepares you for seeing that first hand. Long term, disengaged street youth could keep their cool and define what they wanted to do through music and movies; learning specific skills but also things like communication, literacy, co-operation, empathy and team work without even realising it. Again and again we have seen them reconnect with family or community after years apart, gain self esteem through creativity, develop the confidence to start or return to education or get jobs and find self respect and a sense of their own identity and ability. The magic happens the moment they go from hanging out and doing something because it is cool and they've nothing better to do, to the realisation that they could, perhaps, be somebody and achieve something. Then they get stuck in and start learning; proving to their communities, families and themselves, that they count, after years of being told they will never amount to anything.
WAYout has an open door policy and we encourage new members to find what they are good at rather than push them through a set pattern of training. We also offer grants to members who have been coming for at least six months and are serious about learning, to find them homes, for travel to reconnect with family or to return to education.
Our home -is a building in a compound that houses the two recording studios funded by the Joe Strummer Foundation, the photoshop room, two editing rooms and a dedicated women's room with a large outdoor space for teaching, dancing or rehearsing. We also have a smaller base in Kissi Town, the old refugee camp which is home to 22,000 people and still has no electricity supply or water.

In the studio we have recorded over 2000 tracks and 12 albums. The Black Street Family, once notorious gangsters, have completely changed their image through having access to a free studio to record their music.
1040 course certificates have been awarded to WAYout members
85 members have been found homes whilst others have received travel or education grants.
Some WAYout members now have jobs as senior editors, camera operators and presenters at all three National TV stations and some successfully work freelance.

Unfortunately, due to the circumstances, she had to decline that offer. My mother has taught us to work hard for our dreams and that there is a possibility for everything. “Si Se Puede” (Yes we can) she would always say. She has also taught us to be just, to be active in our communities and to speak up... even when it is hard to do so.

Our family, our community, and many others have made great efforts to take her case this far. As of today, Wednesday May 3, 2017 we only have 30 days to raise $37,000. This money makes it possible to pay the costs of renown immigration lawyer <a href=""http://www.usavisacounsel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richard Hanus</a> as well as the costs of filing with the Supreme Court. (We have chosen to raise $39,960 to cover Indiegogo related fees).</p><p>This is what happened:</p><p>In 2005, just a few years after arriving in the U.S. and while renewing her driver's license at an Illinois state DMV, my mother was registered to vote as a part of customary protocol established by the <strong>1993 National Voter Registration Act, which federally mandates that this service be offered to all patrons of the DMV regardless of their citizenship status. To make matters worse, this same law forbids DMV officials from discouraging anyone from registering, even clearly ineligible folks, like my mother, who should never have been asked to register to vote in the first place.</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In fact, there are currently no procedural distinctions made between citizens and non-citizens during this federalized recruitment procedure. This means that, under this law, non-citizens are engaged and welcomed into the voter registration process as if they are citizens of the United States. This explains how, despite providing clear disclosure to the official that my mother was not a U.S. citizen, she was still recruited to fill out a voter registration form.</p><p>She was puzzled by the situation but was quickly given the form to fill out which did not provide a way to identify herself as a permanent resident and not a citizen.  When she asked if this was legal and whether she was supposed to register, the DMV official advised her “it’s up to you”.  As a result of not being provided with the only correct answer – which was NO, my mother understood the official’s words as permission to proceed to register. From there, as a result of filling out this form, she was unknowingly unlawfully making a claim to be a U.S. citizen.

Taking this case to the Supreme Court may only give a slim chance to change my mother's deportation outcome, but it will leave a stepping stone for many others caught in the same situation. The well intended Motor Voter Law is entrapping non-citizens into registering to vote, and voting, and as a result causing deportations. We need your help to change this. ​It is a rare circumstance to have the opportunity to present a case in front of the Supreme Court. This gives us hope that our actions will make a difference- with your help.​My name is Connie Fitzpatrick and I am here on behalf of my family. I am here for my mother, for her children, and for her grandchild... but especially for my mother's ten-year fight towards justice.My family and I came to the US in 2001, legally. My mom, Margarita Del Pilar Fitzpatrick, has always maintained a legal status while in the US. She has recently lost her US Permanent Residence as part of the deportation procedures. She now holds a working permit while she awaits a decision by the US Supreme Court as to whether they will consider her case. My sisters and I are U.S. Citizens, and so is my niece. We are active members of our communities and respect the rule of law.Education has always been a priority in our home. While raising three daughters as a single parent, my mom worked and attended college simultaneously. She eventually earned her degree and has served as a Registered Nurse in the State of Kansas and Virginia for the past three years and nine months. She has been accepted to the Doctor of Nursing Practice program in hopes of becoming a Family Nurse Practitioner and working with underserved populations. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances, she had to decline that offer. My mother has taught us to work hard for our dreams and that there is a possibility for everything. “Si Se Puede” (Yes we can) she would always say. She has also taught us to be just, to be active in our communities and to speak up... even when it is hard to do so. Like right now.She has fought towards justice for ten years and is now one step away from appealing to the Supreme Court. Our family, our community, and many others have made great efforts to take her case this far. As of today, Wednesday May 3, 2017 we only have 30 days to raise $37,000. This money makes it possible to pay the costs of renown immigration lawyer Richard Hanus as well as the costs of filing with the Supreme Court. (We have chosen to raise $39,960 to cover Indiegogo related fees).This is what happened:In 2005, just a few years after arriving in the U.S. and while renewing her driver's license at an Illinois state DMV, my mother was registered to vote as a part of customary protocol established by the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, which federally mandates that this service be offered to all patrons of the DMV regardless of their citizenship status. To make matters worse, this same law forbids DMV officials from discouraging anyone from registering, even clearly ineligible folks, like my mother, who should never have been asked to register to vote in the first place.In fact, there are currently no procedural distinctions made between citizens and non-citizens during this federalized recruitment procedure. This means that, under this law, non-citizens are engaged and welcomed into the voter registration process as if they are citizens of the United States. This explains how, despite providing clear disclosure to the official that my mother was not a U.S. citizen, she was still recruited to fill out a voter registration form.She was puzzled by the situation but was quickly given the form to fill out which did not provide a way to identify herself as a permanent resident and not a citizen.  When she asked if this was legal and whether she was supposed to register, the DMV official advised her “it’s up to you”.  As a result of not being provided with the only correct answer – which was NO, my mother understood the official’s words as permission to proceed to register. From there, as a result of filling out this form, she was unknowingly unlawfully making a claim to be a U.S. citizen. My mother eventually received a confirmation letter that she was allowed to vote.  In the end, my mother believed that the DMV official knew the law better than her and would never mislead her or offer her an opportunity to commit an unlawful act. Well, the DMV official did mislead her, and because of that she faces immediate deportation.Fortunately there is hope for change – This federalized process of soliciting non-citizens to register to vote was called into question by the Keathley v. Holder case of 2009, where a legal alien in a similar position successfully fought off deportation. In 2017 my mother appealed her case under the Seventh Circuit Court. Though her case was denied, it give us a step towards appealing to the Supreme Court.We only have a short time to raise funds to cover Supreme Court filing fees, including the service cost of immigration lawyer Richard Hanus. Please help us with any amount you can so that we can make an appeal and keep families together.I have made this video not just for my family, but also for awareness of how the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, also known as the Motor Voter Law, affects the lives of non-citizens. Together we can make a difference.Attached below are brief publications that illustrate the faulty process of voter registration solicitation at DMVs, and other important public documents. Links:NBC National News Coverage:http://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/peru-native-who-voted-illegally-two-u-s-elections-now-n746721Application for Stay of Removal- Law Offices of Richard Hanus - US Department of Homeland Security I.C.E, Margarita Fitzpatrickhttp://issuu.com/conniefitzp/docs/skm_c65817042401430United States Court of Appeals For the Seventh Circuit- Margarita Fitzpatrick, Before Easterbrook, Williams, and Sykes, Circuit Judges. 2017http://issuu.com/conniefitzp/docs/rssexec.plSeventh Circuit Federal Court Hearing- audio recording, Margarita Fitzpatrick.

<h3>Wear The String for Peace </h3>
<p>There is no doubt that hatred, racism and violence against anyone that's ""different"" is at a crisis level globally. The String represents a strong rejection of this behavior, and that's the effort I'm hoping to start with your help! Tempers are quick, guns are everywhere, children are dying, fathers are being incarcerated, mothers are being abused. We can't hear the cries because of the noise. Wear The Peace String as a quiet stand against the anger.</p>
<p>I've been a Graphic Designer my entire career. I've worked for a variety of organizations that allowed me to produce amazing designs for sports teams, events, theme parks and television shows. This endeavor however, is my most passionate. Sometimes it's not how loud you speak, but what you say, so please help me say it. Join me in the quiet war. I would love to see people wearing the String and acknowledging each other as they go by with their own String. Eventually I would love to have owners of a String join ""Peace Pals"" which connects each person who registers on the website with someone else who owns a String. This will begin to form the network that can bring about change!</p>

<p>Over time my wish is to have The String influence our approach to each other and help teach tolerance. If we become ambassadors of Peace we can change negative attitudes a little at a time. Peace String hopes to become involved in community efforts and we will be donating a percentage of the proceeds from this effort to a Charity that shares a similar mission. I am researching charities that focus on young adults, one that provides support for their challenges, losses, and victimization.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>I am dedicated to making this work! You take chances to make a change and I believe we can all do this together. I know there will be challenges along the way but I know that people want this, and it will be worth every phone call, gallon of gas, plea for assistance, every frustration I may face, if in the end we have people wearing a String that provokes peaceful conversations, and diminishes fear. Risks are everywhere, that's why we need to build a strong community of ""Stringers""</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to help financially at this time, then please just talk about us, send your friends over here to help. Post this on FB, as anything is something.

</div></div>","Wear The String for Peace 
There is no doubt that hatred, racism and violence against anyone that's ""different"" is at a crisis level globally. The String represents a strong rejection of this behavior, and that's the effort I'm hoping to start with your help! Tempers are quick, guns are everywhere, children are dying, fathers are being incarcerated, mothers are being abused. We can't hear the cries because of the noise. Wear The Peace String as a quiet stand against the anger.
I've been a Graphic Designer my entire career. I've worked for a variety of organizations that allowed me to produce amazing designs for sports teams, events, theme parks and television shows. This endeavor however, is my most passionate. Sometimes it's not how loud you speak, but what you say, so please help me say it. Join me in the quiet war. I would love to see people wearing the String and acknowledging each other as they go by with their own String. Eventually I would love to have owners of a String join ""Peace Pals"" which connects each person who registers on the website with someone else who owns a String. This will begin to form the network that can bring about change!


What you can help achieve 
I'm hoping that the funding provided here will enable us to produce finished Strings, set up  the website, print collateral (postcards, stickers and flyers) to bring awareness, and cover the costs of registering the brand and trademark. We are hoping that eventually we will also have Tees and bracelets available for sale on the website.

<h3>The Queer Facilitator Course</h3>
<p>Many LGBTQIAs don't even know what embodiment is, but we're changing that - and <strong>helping change the lives of LGBTQIAs in Russia for the better</strong>. For the past 3 years we have been working with Mark Walsh, director of the Embodied Facilitator Course. He has done charity workshops for the LGBTQIA community and helped us set up a 3-month embodied training programme for our community.</p>
<p><i>""I've started noticing my body: how I am, what I am doing...""</i> - S.</p>
<p><i>""I can tap into self-care before I start burning out"" </i>- N.</p>
<p><i>""I feel like I have given myself permission to be""</i> - A.</p>
<p>These are all things participants have said and that we would like to carry to the rest of our community.</p>
<p><strong>In 2019 we want to offer the ""Queer Facilitator Course"" to 15 activists</strong> - that's twice as many people as last year and it's a lot of work. We'll need 1,500 GBP (1700 EUR) to cover rent, admin, and trainer costs. It would make a huge difference because the activists invited on the course are <strong>already doing massive work with the LGBTQIA community here</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541437119/zik8gg1hfxlt1eyyvvdo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Training up our own embodied facilitators</h3>
<p>By the same token, we can't keep relying on invited trainers, no matter how good they are. <strong>We need to train up our own facilitators who know the LGBTQ context</strong> from their personal experience. Many LGBTQ activists in Russia dedicate a great portion of their lives to serving our community and do not have the financial means to enroll on a long-term programme.</p>
<p>The embodiment course in Russia has agreed to train LGBTQ activists on a by-donation basis, so <strong>every 1,000 GBP allows us to send 1 activist on a year-long programme</strong>. After they complete the programme, they will be able to give back to the community by providing charity workshops.</p>
<p>If we have 5 certified embodied facilitators who are also activists, <strong>we can ensure</strong> <strong>1 embodiment event for LGBTQs every week</strong> that is accessible to everyone from our community. Also, since we're not relying on just one activist, we know we're not putting them in a situation of potential burnout.</p>

<h3>Meet Neha</h3>
<p>This illustrated children’s book, lovingly crafted by the team over the past year, provides a beautiful, engaging and informative introduction to the condition of statelessness, endured by more than 15 million people around the world, with a child being born stateless every 10 minutes! </p>
<p>The book tells the story of Neha, an <strong>ordinary</strong> 12-year-old girl with an <strong>extraordinary</strong> problem. Neha, her sister Nikita and their mother are from Nepal. But there is something wrong. They are not treated the same. They cannot sit important exams or travel abroad. Their mom constantly has to fight for their right to belong. But then something amazing happens.</p>
<p>Neha – with the help of some magic coins – is able to travel the world. She visits new countries, makes new friends and learns about<strong> nationality </strong>and <strong>statelessness. </strong></p>
<p>Through her adventure, she pieces together bits of the puzzle about her own <strong>nationality. </strong>She learns how</p>
<ul>
<li>those who <strong>should </strong>have a nationality are <strong>denied</strong> it,</li>
<li>those who <strong>would </strong>have a nationality cannot <strong>prove </strong>it, and</li>
<li>those who <strong>do </strong>have a nationality can <strong>lose </strong>it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Neha and her friends also learn more about the struggles faced by stateless children around the world. And importantly, what they can do to challenge statelessness and demand that every child have a nationality!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Help us make a difference!</h3></div><div>
<p>The book is designed to help children explore not just how nationality works and what role it plays in our day-to-day lives, but also build their understanding of the rights they hold as children. The beautifully textured illustrations of Dian Pu complement the poignant photographs of Saiful Huq Omi and Greg Constantine and the original artwork of stateless children to bring the story to life.</p>
<p>The end product is a wonderful teaching, learning and awareness raising resource – made all the better by our plans to develop an accompanying website of additional materials, activities and a related teachers guide. What’s more, the book is currently being made available in four languages! English, French, Spanish and Dutch.</p>
<p><strong>Now we need your support, to share this book with others!</strong> We want to place copies of the book in the hands of teachers and pupils, parents and children, policy makers and journalists. Those with nationality and without, all around the world, with a special focus on countries where many children face statelessness. We want to develop the accompanying website and teachers guide. And most importantly, we want this book to make a real difference. We believe it can educate and inform children and adults alike about statelessness. But more than this, it can instil a deeper commitment among young and old to come together to act against statelessness!</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are the <strong>Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion</strong> (ISI), an indepdendent non-profit organisation founded, in the Netherlands, in late 2014 with the mission to promote inclusive societies by realising and protecting the right to a nationality. Ensuring that everyone enjoys a nationality, is necessary for promoting and fulfilling other human rights, reducing poverty and inequality, and countering discrimination and intolerance. </p>
<p>Helping to ensure that children are included and enjoy a nationality is particularly important. From a young age, stateless children are aware of the disadvantage and discrimination they face. Statelessness can not only prevent children from exercising their rights (to education, to healthcare, etc), but it can also has a significant and lasting impact on a child’s sense of belonging and self-worth. This is why realising the right of every child to a nationality is a key focus of our work and we have created this book to help us work to achieve this.</p>

<h3><strong>Together we can make a real difference! </strong></h3>
<p>We strongly believe that <strong><i>The Girl Who Lost Her Country</i></strong> will be a valuable resource in the effort to raise awareness about statelessness and advocate for change.

<li><p><i>This marvellous book addresses one of today’s most egregious and elusive human rights challenges with admirable clarity and energy.  It provides a powerful tool for educators, for youth advocates and for young people eager to understand how a basic lynchpin of human belonging can be denied to millions of people today. - </i>Jacqueline Bhabha, Professor of the Practice of Health and Human Rights, Harvard University</p></li>
<li><p><i>This book is an entertaining – and educational – introduction to statelessness for children. Neha’s journey clearly highlights the struggles Stateless children and their families can face. It helps children learn about their rights, and how they can help. - </i>Kerry L. Neal, Child Protection Specialist, UNICEF</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, here is how Neha and her sister Nikita responded when they read the book!</p>
<p><i>We are immensely happy and so grateful to you all for this amazing book. We have lived as stateless for so many years, and more than we sisters, our mother has fought a lot. Through this book we feel like her call for fighting this injustice will be reached worldwide and more understanding hearts will join in.</i></p>
<p><i>We would like to thank the writer in particular for allowing us (stateless children around the world) to an avenue to dare to dream, of breaking the chain and fly beyond borders.

<h3>WHY UnBroken and why ME?? </h3>
<p>My name is Samantha Gerson, and I am a survivor of Institutional Abuse and Conversion Therapy. At age 12, I came out of the closet as gay, and started dealing with a lot of inner turmoil. I ran away from home and found myself in life threatening situations. Rather than get help from home, I was kidnapped from my high school, and taken to a remote part of Utah where I spent the next nine months enduring physical, emotional and sexual abuse at a ""residential treatment center."" Day 1, I was stripped of my clothes, and my identity. I quickly learned that the only way out was to play the system. I came out of treatment in much worse condition than I went in, only to find out there was no one waiting on the outside to help me. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Watching my friends from my institution die by suicide, get locked up for crimes, or live a life of addiction, made me realize something needs to change. I pursued a career in Social Work so I could help young survivors like I once was. As an LMSW, I work with survivors of all kinds, but knowing this $6 billion industry is going nowhere, I know it's time to make space for these survivors. These youth need counseling, vocational services and legal support, before they turn into another statistic. This non-profit, is the crux of my life's work, and will help to end this epidemic before another generation must endure this torture and trauma. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contributions will allow me to hire consultants around the US so that no survivor must struggle due to lack of funds. We will be able to access youth all around the country, and help them beat the odds. This funding will pay for our thorough, confidential software, and allow a staff of three to dedicate their full attention to this cause. This funding will also pay for liability insurance, so that no one is mistreated or wrongly accused. Our goal is to be the solution to an epidemic that has existed since the 1800's. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; WHY?</h3>
<p>Today our goal is to hit 1.5 million in donations. This will pay specifically for the following:</p>
<p>1) Complete internet software that is HIPAA compliant, user friendly, and systematically thorough.</p>
<p>2) An app for adolescents who are in dire need of services.</p>
<p>3) Liability insurance to start contracting with consultants across the US.</p>
<p>4) Ability to pay the consultants so no survivor has to think about $$ when seeking help.</p>
<p>5) Salary for the three staff that will dedicate their full time/lives to making UnBroken a national success.</p>
<p>6) The full launch of NFP status, in both CA and NYS. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, this is our priority list and will be paid for as we receive the funds. Our goal is to get this software going so we can reach the most youth accessible. Whether we reach our goal or not, we plan to be in full effect by the next fiscal year. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>YOUR IMPACT!</h3>
<p>Institutionalized youth, specifically, those who underwent conversion therapy, leave institutions in worse condition. Instead of receiving care, they are traumatized, and come out in a bad state. GLBT youth are 4x as likely to commit suicide as their peers, and those that undergo Conversion Therapy are 6x more likely. 85% of survivors either kill themselves, end up in jail or on drugs. There is no solution for this population, and they need care.</p>
<p>All survivors of institutional abuse are my target. Over 3,000 institutions have been named as abusive, this year alone. This population include survivors of religious cults, privatized ""teen rehabs"" and conversion therapy clinics. Currently, I work (pro bono), in a clinical nature, with 15 survivors and this number continues to increase as my social media presence increases.</p>
<p>By providing trained and competent counselors and lawyers for the survivors of these horrific places, we are able to reroute the teen's trajectory. Instead of being a statistic, we can help these youth lead a healthy and functional lifestyle, instead of succumbing to the trauma they endured. Youth have human rights, and the lawyers will be able to fight for them. </p>

YASH antaa tukea ja opastusta haavoittuville nuorille tarjoamalla elämäntaitoja tulevaisuutta varten ja mahdollistamalla nuorten oikeuden saada tietoa ja koulutusta seksuaaliasioista. YASH käyttää taidetta, koska se on loistava työkalu käsitellä arkaluontoisia seksuaalisuuteen liittyviä aiheita. Taideharjoitukset antavat nuorille uusia ilmaisutyökaluja, jotka voivat olla erittäin voimaannuttavia nuorille, jotka joutuvat ratkaisemaan vaikeita kysymyksiä jo varhaisessa iässä. YASH tekee aina kulttuuritutkimusta jokaisesta yhteisöstä, jossa se toimii, ja pyrkii vastaamaan yhteisön yksilöllisiin tarpeisiinsa. YASH:n ydinarvo on työskennellä suoraan ruohonjuuritasolla paikallisten perheiden ja ammattilaisten kanssa.</p><p><strong>2.Koska koulutus on avain kehitykseen.</strong> Korkealaatuinen koulutus on tärkein ihmiskunnan tervettä kehitystä ohjaava asia. Yhteisöt, joissa seksuaalikasvatusta ei ole, kamppailevat usein ongelmien kanssa kuten teiniraskaudet, koulunkäynnin keskeyttämiset, seksuaaliset hyväksikäytöt sekä huono seksuaali- ja lisääntymisterveys. Sukupuoli- ja seksuaalivalistus on tärkein ennaltaehkäisykeino näihin ongelmiin. Alueilla, joilla toteutamme YASH projektia, on väestönkasvu nopeaa, kun taas elinolosuhteet ovat edelleen huonot. Koulutuksella ja lisääntymisterveydellä on suuri rooli näiden ihmisten elinolojen parantamisessa. Kun suuri osa tytöistä keskeyttää koulun varhaisessa iässä, se lisää sukupuolten välistä eriarvoisuutta ja vaikuttaa koko maan talouteen.</p><p><strong>3.Koska se edistää kestävää kehitystä.</strong> Ilmaston lämpeneminen ja ylikansoitus ovat olleet osa ihmiskuntaamme viime vuosikymmeninä. Vaikka nämä asiat nähdäänkin ylivoimaisina, YASH uskoo tulevaisuuden olevan erittäin myönteinen, jos oikeat asiat tehdään riittävän aijoissa. YASH uskoo, että lisäämällä korkealaatuista koulutusta ja sukupuolten tasa-arvoa, ihmisillä on paljon parermmat mahdollisuudet löytää ratkaisuita suuriin globaaleihin kysymyksiin. </p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580195277/ehqkf58wkamgjtqwl2bp.png"" src=""""/></h2><p> </p><p>Teimme ensimmäisen vuonna 2017 toteutetun YASH -projektin nollabudjetilla.

Salaries will not be paid and all the workforce in the project will work voluntarily. Organising comprehensive YASH program for one institution costs around 600€.  The amount of money we are able to raise in this crowdfunding will have an immediate impact on how many organisations we will be organising YASH project for. Our crowdfunding goal is 5000€ but as it is a flexible goal we are happy if we achieve a goal of 2000€ We will go to organise YASH project in as many institutions as the budget allows us. These institutions are primary schools and local organisations working with adolescents.  Each institution we work with will:1. Receive our study curriculum and study materials.2. We will organise workshops for the professionals in these institutions and l walk them through how to use the materials step by step3. We will organise comprehensive YASH education project for their students4. Follow up and help them to continue organising sexuality education in the future.Our main goal is to implement comprehensive sexuality education in these institutions permanently.                                                                                                                                      Karolina Lahti: Bachelor of social services, a  visual artist  and the founder of the YASH project. While my career has kept me involved with art and videography, my studies brought me to Ghana for the first time in 2017, where I worked on my Thesis on sexual education in cooperation with SCEF, a local NGO focused on the same topics. As my work evolved, we decided to test what we learned in the local schools and organisations and that is how, following very successful results, YASH was born. Eugene Ufoka: Bachelor of social services, human rights activist and project manager of the YASH project. I'm born in a small coastal city called Tiko in the southwest of former British Southern Cameroons. I'm passionate about making the world a better place. I m committed in the mission to achieve a more fair and equal society closing the gender and race inequalities in the world.Paul Semeh: Bachelor of social science, the founder of the Street Children Empowerment Foundation and the main partner for the YASH project in Ghana. I founded and lead the Street Children Empowerment Foundation (SCEF) in Ghana and I am passionate about Safeguarding, human rights, and human development-related areas.  
  YASH is aiming to achieve high goals in 6 months' time with a relatively low budget.  YASH is prepared to extend the project for a couple more months if needed without needing a bigger budget. YASH is a development cooperation project, working within different cultures. When cooperating between  different cultures there is always a risk for misunderstandings, especially when dealing with difficult topics such as sexuality. YASH is designed with cultural sensitivity to respect the local culture and will try to avoid harmful misunderstandings and cultural conflicts by simply listening, reflecting, collecting feedback, and keeping calm in difficult situations. Follow us in Instagram, Facebook or visit our website.

YASH projekti keskittyy vähävaraisiin kaupunkialueisiin aloittaen Afrikan mantereelta, Ghanan pääkaupungista Accrasta, Nima ja Jamestown nimisistä kaupunginosista, mahdollistamalla nuorille heidän seksuaalioikeutensa tietoonja kouolutukseen  ja siten kohentaa merkittävästi heidän seksuaaliterveyttään.Tämän joukkorahoituskamppanijan tavoite on 5000€  mutta sen ollessa joustava tavoite olemme tyytyväisiä, jos saavutamme 2000€ tavoitteen, jonka avulla voimme viimeistellä uusimmat versiot oppimateriaaleistamme ja järjestää YASH-koulutuksen kouluissa sekä iltapäiväohjelmissa. Mitä enemmän rahaa saamme, sitä enemmän kouluja ja organisaatioita pystymme ottamaan projektiin mukaan. YASH- projektin järjestäminen  yhdelle instituutiolle maksaa noin 600 euroa.Kouolutamme oppilaita ja opettajia peruskouluissa, koulujärjestelmän ulkopuolelle jääneitä  haavoittuvassa asemassa olevia nuoria iltapäiväkerhoissa,  sekä järjestämme seksuaalikasvatustyöpajoja terveydenhuollon, sosiaalityön, politiikan ja koulutuksen ammattilaisten kanssa. Olemme luoneet ohjelman oppimateriaalit yhteistyössä paikallisen organisaation kanssa käyttämällä luotettavia tutkimusmenetelmiä ja testaamalla materiaaleja käytännössä. Olemme päivittäneet materiaaleja jatkuvasti palvelemaan paikallisten yhteisöjen tarpeita.   1.Koska se voimaannuttaa haavoittuvia yhteisöjä. Uskomme, että muutos alkaa yksilöiden voimaannuttamisesta. YASH antaa tukea ja opastusta haavoittuville nuorille tarjoamalla elämäntaitoja tulevaisuutta varten ja mahdollistamalla nuorten oikeuden saada tietoa ja koulutusta seksuaaliasioista. YASH käyttää taidetta, koska se on loistava työkalu käsitellä arkaluontoisia seksuaalisuuteen liittyviä aiheita. Taideharjoitukset antavat nuorille uusia ilmaisutyökaluja, jotka voivat olla erittäin voimaannuttavia nuorille, jotka joutuvat ratkaisemaan vaikeita kysymyksiä jo varhaisessa iässä. YASH tekee aina kulttuuritutkimusta jokaisesta yhteisöstä, jossa se toimii, ja pyrkii vastaamaan yhteisön yksilöllisiin tarpeisiinsa. YASH:n ydinarvo on työskennellä suoraan ruohonjuuritasolla paikallisten perheiden ja ammattilaisten kanssa.2.Koska koulutus on avain kehitykseen. Korkealaatuinen koulutus on tärkein ihmiskunnan tervettä kehitystä ohjaava asia. Yhteisöt, joissa seksuaalikasvatusta ei ole, kamppailevat usein ongelmien kanssa kuten teiniraskaudet, koulunkäynnin keskeyttämiset, seksuaaliset hyväksikäytöt sekä huono seksuaali- ja lisääntymisterveys. Sukupuoli- ja seksuaalivalistus on tärkein ennaltaehkäisykeino näihin ongelmiin. Alueilla, joilla toteutamme YASH projektia, on väestönkasvu nopeaa, kun taas elinolosuhteet ovat edelleen huonot. Koulutuksella ja lisääntymisterveydellä on suuri rooli näiden ihmisten elinolojen parantamisessa. Kun suuri osa tytöistä keskeyttää koulun varhaisessa iässä, se lisää sukupuolten välistä eriarvoisuutta ja vaikuttaa koko maan talouteen.3.Koska se edistää kestävää kehitystä. Ilmaston lämpeneminen ja ylikansoitus ovat olleet osa ihmiskuntaamme viime vuosikymmeninä. Vaikka nämä asiat nähdäänkin ylivoimaisina, YASH uskoo tulevaisuuden olevan erittäin myönteinen, jos oikeat asiat tehdään riittävän aijoissa. YASH uskoo, että lisäämällä korkealaatuista koulutusta ja sukupuolten tasa-arvoa, ihmisillä on paljon parermmat mahdollisuudet löytää ratkaisuita suuriin globaaleihin kysymyksiin.    Teimme ensimmäisen vuonna 2017 toteutetun YASH -projektin nollabudjetilla. Loimme projektissa ensimmäiset versiot kaikista YASH -koulutusmateriaaleista, koulutimme peruskoulussa 120 lasta, järjestimme yhden työpajan 5 opettajan kouluttamiseksi käyttämään koulutusmateriaaleja sekä järjestimme iltapäiväohjelman 8 viikon ajaksi 12 murrosikäiselle.Keräämämme rahat käytetään oppimateriaalin luomiseen ja projektin toimintakuluihin, joita ovat internet-, sähkö- ja luokkahuoneiden vuokrauskulut. Projektihenkilöstölle ei makseta palkkoja. Työskentely perustuu vapaaehtoisuuteen.YASH- projektin järjestäminen  yhdelle instituutiolle maksaa noin 600 euroa. Mitä enemmän rahaa onnistumme keräämään,  sitä enemmän kouluja ja organisaatioita pystymme ottamaan projektiin mukaan. Tämän joukkorahoituskamppanijan tavoite on 5000€  mutta sen ollekka joustava tavoite olemme tyytyväisiä, jos saavutamme 2000€ tavoitteen.Aiomme järjestää YASH-projektin niin moniin instituutioihin kuin saavuttavamme budjetti sallii. Nämä laitokset ovat peruskouluja ja nuorten kanssa työskenteleviä paikallisia organisaatioita.Jokainen instituutio, jonka kanssa työskentelemme tulee 1. Vastaanota opintosuunnitelmamme ja oppimateriaalimme.2. Järjestämme työpajoja ammattilaisille näissä instituutioissa ja opastamme heitä käyttämään materiaaleja askel askeleelta. 3. Järjestämme kattavan YASH-koulutusprojektin  heidänopiskelijoilleen. 4. Seuraa ja auta heitä jatkamaan seksuaalikasvatuksen järjestämistä tulevaisuudessa.Päätavoitteemme on että projektissa mukana olevat instituutiot alkaisivat järjestämään kattavaa seksuaalikasvatusta näissä laitoksissa pysyvästi.   Karolina Lahti:Sosionomi, video artisti ja YASH-projektin perustaja. Vaikka työni tällä hetkellä on videotuotannon parissa, sosionomi-opinnot veivät minut ensimmäistä kertaa Ghanaan vuonna 2017. Tein seksuaalikasvatusta koskevan opinnäytetyöni yhteistyössä paikallisen samoihin aiheisiin keskittyvän organisaation SCEF: n kanssa. opinnäytetyöni valmistuttua päätimme testata oppimaamme paikallisissa kouluissa ja organisaatioissa, ja näin syntyi erittäin onnistunein tuloksin YASH. Eugene Ufoka: Sosionomi, ihmisoikeusaktivisti ja YASH-projektin projektipäällikkö. Olen syntynyt Kamerunissa pienessä rannikkokaupungissa nimeltään Tiko. Intohimoni on tehdä maailmasta parempi paikka elää. Olen sitoutunut tehtävääni saada aikaan oikeudenmukaisempi ja tasa-arvoisempi yhteiskunta, jossa ei ole sukupuolten ja rotujen eriarvoisuutta.Paul Semeh:Yhteiskuntatieteiden kandidaatti, Street Children Empowerment - organisaation perustaja ja YASH-hankkeen pääpartneri Ghanassa. Johdan Street Children Empowerment -säätiötä (SCEF) Ghanassa. Olen intohimoinen ihmisoikeuksien ja inhimilliseen kehitykseen liittyvien asioiden puolustaja. 
  YASH pyrkii saavuttamaan korkeat tavoitteet 6 kuukauden aikana suhteellisen pienellä budjetilla. YASH on varautunut jatkamaan hanketta vielä pari kuukautta yli alkuperäisen aikataulun tarvitsematta lisäbudjettia.YASH on kehitysyhteistyöhanke, joka toimii eri kulttuureissa. Yhteistyössä eri kulttuurien kesken on aina väärinymmärryksen riski, etenkin kun käsitellään vaikeita aiheita, kuten seksuaalisuutta. YASH kunnioittaa paikallista kulttuuria ja yrittää välttää haitallisia väärinkäsityksiä ja kulttuurikonflikteja kuuntelemalla, pohtimalla, keräämällä palautetta ja pysyttelemällä rauhallisena vaikeissakin tilanteissa.Seuraa meitä Instagramissa, Facebookissa tai käy verkkosivuillamme.

<p><strong>WHAT</strong></p>
<p>In April, RAaW are filming a series of high quality, professional standard, short films with our students, in order to create showreels to launch their careers in the industry. </p>
<p>Many of these films are about important issues including sexual abuse, mental health, drug abuse and cancer. These will be done both subtly and overtly, enabling taboo subjects to be discussed and explored. </p>
<p>An example of one of these is 'Grow old together', a beautiful short about Daisy, who's best friend is terminally ill from cancer, and how her boyfriend, Jamie, helps her through it. </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>We are a self-funded company, and as it stands are unable to fund the films this year.</p>
<p>The money you donate to us will go towards:</p>

<li>Paying crew</li>
<li>Paying for locations</li>
<li>Buying food for the cast and crew</li>
<li>Paying a photographer to take stills</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT:</strong></p>
<p>These films will be edited together to make a showreel for each of our students. A showreel is extremely important to help launch their careers in the industry, providing Casting Directors with a quick and clear demonstration of an actor's talent and range.

<p><i>Your voice is needed in this practice of true democracy!</i></p>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.mandalaforchange.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mandala Center for Change</a> proudly launches this project aimed at public education and social change around the issues faced by LGTBQ+ youth – an underrepresented population, especially on government and policy-making levels. Legislative Theatre has been effectively used to steer laws and policies around the world.  <i><strong>Inclusive, fun, dynamic and participatory!</strong></i></p>
<p><br/><u><strong>LEGISLATIVE THEATRE: A THREE-STEP PROCESS</strong></u></p>
<p>1 - The project kicks off this August 2017 with a 5-day Theatre of the Oppressed (TO) workshop for 20 youth (ages 14-20), who self-identify as LGBTQ+. Participants will be guided by <a href=""http://www.mandalaforchange.com/about-us/our-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marc Weinblatt</a>, a world-renowned TO facilitator and founder of the Mandala Center, and assisted by Tanner DeLuna, a youth leader, activist, and emerging TO practitioner. The youth will explore their struggles through dynamic creative processes and identify real threats to themselves and their community. </p>
<p>2 - Through personal story sharing youth will create a short play depicting their real-life struggles. This play will be presented in two interactive theatre performances for the general public and invited legislators/policy makers on September 25 &amp; 26, 2017. </p>
<p>Each performance will include a community forum where audience members come on stage to take over a character and improvise solutions to the issues presented by the youth.</p>
<p>3 - Finally both youth and audience will propose policy ideas and vote on the laws they want to see passed in a theatrical mock legislature. <strong>Legislators and other policy makers who have the power to create the change will see and hear first-hand the problems faced by the youth and the community’s solutions to address them.</strong></p>
<p><br/><u><strong>THE ROOTS OF LEGISLATIVE THEATRE</strong></u></p>
<p>Developed by Brazilian visionary and Nobel Prize nominee, Augusto Boal, Legislative Theatre is part of his famous <a href=""http://www.mandalaforchange.com/applied-theatre/theatre-of-the-oppressed/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theatre of the Oppressed (TO)</a>. TO is used all over the world for social and political activism, conflict resolution, community building, therapy, and government legislation. It is practiced globally on a grassroots level by community organizers, activists, teachers, social workers, cultural animators, and more.</p>
<p>The Mandala Center for Change, along with its founder, Marc Weinblatt, is one of the most experienced and long-standing hubs for the training and grassroots practice of Theatre of the Oppressed in the world. Founded in 1999, the Mandala Center is a multi-disciplinary arts education organization dedicated to community dialogue, social justice, and societal transformation.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>RIPPLES OF IMPACT</strong></u></p>
<h3>Not only will this project cultivate a way for LGBTQ+ youth to bond and express their experiences in a supportive, safe space; it will create a platform for the local community and its legislators to directly change laws -- youth, adults, allies, and policy-makers working together.</h3>
<p>It also gives youth an opportunity to participate in a true democratic process and an experiential knowledge of how the legislative process works.</p>
<p>And we know it works...because of the success of Mandala Center’s previous Legislative Theatre projects: Youth Legislative Theatre project in Clallam County, WA on the failure of the education system (2016) and our Legislative Theatre project on Healthcare Access and Affordability in Jefferson County, WA (2015).</p>
<p>Take it from the Jefferson County Hospital Commissioner, in office 44 years, Anthony DeLeo: ""This was the most effective community dialogue on healthcare I have ever attended.""<br/> </p>
<p><u><strong>YOUR MONEY AT WORK FOR SOCIAL CHANGE</strong></u></p>
<p>The success of this project depends on the support of individuals like you. The youth are ready to dive in, the facilitators are eager to begin, grant proposals are being written, PR is underway, legislators are being contacted... <strong>now it's your turn to get involved and support grassroots social change driven by the voices of creative, powerful young people and their allies.</strong></p>
<p>Your financial contribution will support a percentage of our $12,000 budget. Along with basics like administrative costs, facilitator fees, production costs, and marketing materials, we are also dedicated to providing youth stipends, food for participants during the project, and an accessible public venue for two evenings of Legislative Theatre performances so anyone who is interested in supporting this issue can attend.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>It is time for unheard voices to be expressed. It is time for policy-makers to listen. Join us and make this exploration a call to action!<br/><i>Thank you for your support. </i></strong></p>

And we know it works...because of the success of Mandala Center’s previous Legislative Theatre projects: Youth Legislative Theatre project in Clallam County, WA on the failure of the education system (2016) and our Legislative Theatre project on Healthcare Access and Affordability in Jefferson County, WA (2015).
Take it from the Jefferson County Hospital Commissioner, in office 44 years, Anthony DeLeo: ""This was the most effective community dialogue on healthcare I have ever attended."" 
YOUR MONEY AT WORK FOR SOCIAL CHANGE
The success of this project depends on the support of individuals like you. The youth are ready to dive in, the facilitators are eager to begin, grant proposals are being written, PR is underway, legislators are being contacted... now it's your turn to get involved and support grassroots social change driven by the voices of creative, powerful young people and their allies.
Your financial contribution will support a percentage of our $12,000 budget. Along with basics like administrative costs, facilitator fees, production costs, and marketing materials, we are also dedicated to providing youth stipends, food for participants during the project, and an accessible public venue for two evenings of Legislative Theatre performances so anyone who is interested in supporting this issue can attend. 
It is time for unheard voices to be expressed. It is time for policy-makers to listen. Join us and make this exploration a call to action!Thank you for your support.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>In the Swahili Language native to Kenya, the phrase Ficha Uchi means to hide nakedness.<span>  Our organization
has adopted this name and has changed the expression of the meaning to signify
a “Restoration of Dignity”.  Our goals
are simple: We want to make sure that every primary school aged child has a respectable school
uniform, one that is not torn, dirty or causes psychological harm to a growing
mind. The early results of our implemented plan has been profoundly impactful
to the families of 728 students clothed by Ficha Uchi Campaign. </span></p>
<p>For many elementary
school aged children growing up in Mathare, going to school is an immense financial
burden on their families. Only those fortunate enough to pay school fees are formally
educated and often have to travel great distances just to attend school
daily.<span>  This often pushes the adults
in Mathare to work multiple low paying jobs to give their children the chance
for a better life.  A struggle and story
familiar to every family thoughout the world. 
We send our children to school so that they have an opportunity to be
better then us. </span></p><p><span>In Kenya, most parents are not able to buy new school
uniforms for their children each academic year.<span> 
As an alternative, parents are forced to buy used school uniforms that are often barely adequate.  These children start every day of school at a disadvantage not only because of the neighborhood they come from, but also the condition of the clothing in which they attend school.  Many children are bullied and made to feel inferior by their peers, sowing the seeds of lifelong self-esteem and self-worth issues. </span></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>We have had great
early success with the Ficha Uchi Campaign.<span> 
To date, we have internally funded the uniforms worn by 728 students in 6
schools in and around the slum of Mathare on the outskirts of Nairobi,
Kenya.  We have learned much about the
process of partnering with primary schools and parents who are overwhelmingly
in support of our efforts.  We offer the
schools, parents and indirectly, the community, an opportunity to participate in
this part charity, part self-help movement to overcome this common social
problem with a simple scalable model.</span></p>
<p><span>If you believe the old adages “be the change you
want to see in the world” and “a rising tides lift all boats” take this
opportunity to join our campaign.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p>Ficha Uchi is a continuation of a movement to self
empowers the poor of Mathare to better their lives by giving them hope through
education. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><b>What
is the purpose of the School Uniform?</b></h2>
<p>There are many theories about the value of a school
uniform.<span>  Some argue that uniforms bring the students a range of benefits: from a sense of belonging or fitting into a
certain school thus bolstering the level of pride students have in schooling, to the belief that the uniform improves the learning ability of students by
reducing distractions and sharpening focus on schoolwork by making the
classroom a more serious environment. </span></p>

Perhaps most
importantly, a uniform means students don't have to worry about peer pressure
when it comes to their clothes. When everyone is dressed the same, worrying
about what you look like isn't so important. There is no competition about
being dressed in the latest trend, which would put a great deal of financial
pressure on students and parents. Potential bullies have one less target for
their insults: it is hard to make fun of what someone is wearing when you're
dressed exactly the same.<div>

<h2><b>What has Ficha Uchi done so far?</b></h2>

<p>
</p>
<p>The Ficha Uchi Organization was launched in March 2015, and we have had amazing results.  We have partnered with 6 primary schools to date and have clothed 728 children.   Our efforts have been supported by our fellow Kenyan community of people who care and our work has been fueled by our love of our community.  Here is a snap shot of our accomplishments:</p>

<h2>So what does my contribution do for the kids of Mathare? </h2>
<p>Good question.  Every donation helps not only children in need of a dignified school uniform, but also helps the community of Mathare in three different ways. Here how it works: </p>
<p><i><b>Event Day</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
management team visits schools to quantify the needs of the
students for school uniforms, usually 10-15% of the school's enrollment. We then engage well-wishers and sponsors with
actual quantity and details of the uniforms targeted to the needy pupils. Through
social media, we mobilize for fabrics, other accessories (threads, buttons,
canvas, and cotton) and then engage local tailors as a means of empowering local
communities. On the day of visit, we organize motivational talks and finally, link beneficiary pupils to career coaches.</p>
<p><i><b>Ficha Uchi Job Training</b></i></p>
<p>In collaboration with the Billian Music Family Centre (Mathare, Kenya) the Ficha Uchi team organizes job training sessions for able bodied adults looking for employment as a tailor.  We train adults, who are often the parents of a recipient of a Ficha Uchi supplied school uniform, in advanced tailoring skill-set.  In exchange for their efforts, we employ them at a discount labor rate for future tailoring needs of a school. The economic empowerment from not only paying adults to participate, but giving them a skill-set, has had great benefits to our adult community as many have secured external employment as a result.  </p>
<p><b><i>Ficha Uchi ""Buy Back"" Program (Sustainability Initiative)</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
uniforms typically have a lifespan of two years . As a measure of sustainability, our
""Buy Back"" policy allows our past beneficiaries to return, gently used school uniforms that a child has out grown.  Ficha Uchi will pay one dollar ($1) for every gently used school uniform, and the child can re-enroll in our program for another school uniform.  The second hand uniforms will
then form part of second batch of donation to the respective schools. Under
this policy, we seek to make our uniforms open to the more able families
at a subsidized fee. In addition to freely
providing uniforms to between 100-200 needy pupils per school, we will give an opportunity to those who are more able to purchase uniforms at a dramatically reduced fee.  This policy will also provide an incentive
for families to take good care of the donated uniforms, thus curbing unnecessary
waste. Through Ficha Uchi's ""Buy Back"" policy, we seek to cut operational cost, further engage our communities involvement in our movement and ensure our
sustainable model as we scale to size.</p>

<h2><b>Why
be Inspired?</b></h2>
<p>Our Initiative is
inspired by our personal experience growing up as poor children in Mathare and
remembering the small and large challenges we had to navigate to make a better
life for ourselves and our families.<span>  All
our paths had one thing in common: Education, Education, Education.  Although
we are old enough to laugh at our successes and failures, we can
all appreciate the simple things in life that would have made life so much more
easier for us growing up.  </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>A home to 500,000 people squeezed into 3 square miles, the Mathare slum is the second largest slum in Kenya. Nothing is simple in Mathare, but a sense of self-worth and dignity can be.  With a single item of clothing, the school uniform, a  child from any socio-economic background can be on the same level as their peers.  Freeing children of the social pressure of being a target for bullying optimizes that child's natural capability to learn and grow.  It's a simple act to help us achieve deep and long lasting consequences.  </div>

remembering the small and large challenges we had to navigate to make a better
life for ourselves and our families.  All
our paths had one thing in common: Education, Education, Education.  Although
we are old enough to laugh at our successes and failures, we can
all appreciate the simple things in life that would have made life so much more
easier for us growing up.  
A home to 500,000 people squeezed into 3 square miles, the Mathare slum is the second largest slum in Kenya. Nothing is simple in Mathare, but a sense of self-worth and dignity can be.  With a single item of clothing, the school uniform, a  child from any socio-economic background can be on the same level as their peers.  Freeing children of the social pressure of being a target for bullying optimizes that child's natural capability to learn and grow.  It's a simple act to help us achieve deep and long lasting consequences.  
We sincerely hope you act and be a part of our movement to Restore Dignity, FICHA UCHI.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello My Precious Contributors,</h3>
<p>First of all, let me introduce myself, my name is <i>Ahmed Al Kilani</i> , I am the Palestinian ambassador against children and women violence in Gaza, Palestine for 6 years. I raised many campaigns to help poor families from my own money and with my friends help. I have a team of volunteers who seek for helping and improving the lives of poor people in Gaza. You can check up my YouTube Channel by my name, where there are many videos about my previous campaigns. </p>
<p>Second, I will explain the reasons to raise this urgent campaign. Through my previous campaigns, I noticed that the Palestinian occupation by Israel impacts children’s everyday lives. Palestinian authorities are greatly dependent on international aid, financial resources are limited and public services are not up to standard. Moreover, reports from non-governmental organizations show that Israel has used force to suppress pro-Palestinian demonstrations, using tear gas and shooting into the crowd without hesitation, even where there are children. The Israel army has defined a stone as a dangerous projectile in the same category as a real bullet. So if a child throws a stone at an Israeli soldier, the latter can respond in force and the child can be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p><strong>Poverty</strong><br/>Israeli restrictions on the free movement of people and goods are major obstacles for the Palestinian economy.</p>
<p>In 2012, the unemployment rate was 27% and according to recent statistics, 26% of Palestinians live below the poverty line.</p>
<p>In Gaza – the most impoverished area – one in two adolescents has the chance to work.</p>
<p>The effects of poverty on children’s lives are numerous: their schooling often remains incomplete because they leave school at a very early age, usually to work and provide for the needs of their families. Early marriages of young girls and adolescent crime are both consequences of poverty.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Education</strong></p>
<p>In Palestine, approximately 70% of children go to primary school.</p>
<p>Access to education is difficult for children who live in refugee camps and villages that do not have a school.</p>
<p>According to a 2013 UNICEF study, more than 2,500 children within educated communities travel through at least one checkpoint per day to go to school – a situation that contributes to school dropouts and child labor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of classes offered is insufficient, which leads to overcrowding, teaching is of the poorest quality and the schools lack resources and materials.</p>
<p>In Gaza, following Operation Cast Lead in 2012, many schools were damaged or destroyed. In 2013, more than 123,000 children had to discontinue their schooling according to UNICEF.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Health Care</strong></p>
<p>In Palestine, the infant mortality rate is seven times higher than that of Israel. Indeed, 30% of Palestinian children die before the age of five. The causes of this high infant mortality rate are varied: anemia, nutritional deficiencies or even severe malnutrition.</p>
<p>Access to health care services can prove extremely problematic in Palestine due to the presence of the wall and checkpoints. Testimonies have been recorded of cases where families found themselves blocked by the Israeli army when they wanted to go to a hospital for treatment of their sick children. Sometimes, if medical treatment is delayed, the outcome can be fatal. During the conflict, many hospitals or clinics were also destroyed, depriving children of their right to health.</p>
<p><strong>Right to water</strong><br/>With water resources being very limited, hygiene is often marginalized in favor of satisfying vital necessities (eating and drinking). Otherwise, the consumption of non-potable water also leads to severe sicknesses in children (diarrhea, hepatitis, etc.).</p>
<p>In Gaza, 95% of the water is unsuitable for human consumption. It is so polluted that it is estimated the territory will have no more drinkable water by 2016, an effect that will be irreversible by 2020. The high level of nitrate (notably due to poor management of wastewater) is the source of many sicknesses that affect babies and children.</p>
<p><strong> Right to have warm winter</strong></p>
<p>Everyone in the world loves winter to play inside the hose with heater and warm weather. However many poor families in Gaza hate winter because their houses will be full of water and cold weather and without heater, they just fire the woods to get warm. Their houses damaged through the previous wars that caused leak and water enters their houses from everywhere. Also, they don’t have heavy clothes to keep them warm from that bad weather and the damaged leaky house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Child Marriages</strong></p>
<p>Even though the legal age of maturity is fixed at 18 years old, child marriages are still commonly practiced in Palestine since one in ten girls are married between 15 and 19 years of age, with 2% of those marriages occurring before the girl is 15.</p>
<p>These marriages can have negative effects on young girls who do not know what the consequences are. In fact, more often than not, after getting married the girls must become wives by looking after the housework and their husband. Additionally, following these marriages the girls frequently become pregnant and have to then take care of their offspring, even though they are still children themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In conclusion, my aim is get rid of every trouble faces those needy children and poor families. So please help me to draw a smile and bright their mind with useful information may help them and help the whole world one day who knows. </p>

<div>Anette Pekrul, former hostage in Iraq</div>
<div>When I was 29, a dream came true for me when I finally, after ten years trial, managed to get a job on a big construction site inMiddle East. I have been working on Basra International Airport in Iraq and I was employed by one of the biggest and best reputed construction companies in Germany. It was a huge challenge as we were only 5 women in a team of 500 men. Very fast I was respected by my colleagues and found first Iraqi friends. We invited each other and learnt about our cultures. During the weekends I discovered the beautiful country and visited historical places – like Babylon or the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis. I stood at the places where Euphrates and Tigris meet, where once was the paradise. The work went well and our Airport was in operation. On 7th August 1990, I wanted to be home in Germany to celebrate my 30th birthday. My dream was over on 2nd of August, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The first time in my life I was involved in war. The situation escalated and I was kept hostage for ten weeks. Instead of having a birthday party I wrote my will. Our situation became worse from week to week – no food, no water and no sign that we could ever leave the country alive. Day by day we were working on our plans how to escape, but our chances were close to zero. At that time I learnt about true Arabic friendship. Even the poorest under the poor helped me. They gave me food and would have hidden me in case of emergency. What the Iraqis did for me, I will never forget. The boss of our company managed to rescue us and just some weeks later the Gulf War started. Back in Germany, I watched the War in TV. I was thinking of my Iraqi friends and praying for them. I could not sleep at night. I had nightmares. I almost drove crazy. Six months after the war I heard in the news that more than five hundred thousand children under five years have died lack of food and medicine. That was my call to action. I started to collect and buy food and medicine, arranged all documents, even an official allowance from UN and started transportation to Iraq. From Jordan to Baghdad by truck 1800 kilometers through desert ... Since then, I am engaged in helping people in need. But this time I am able to help in my home country. The experience of war and being kept hostage changed my life, my values and my targets.<br/>

<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We can! They can!<br/>
Of course, I started to help immediately when the first refugees arrived here
in the small city of Staßfurt/Eastern Germany. We shared clothes and food and
tried to give a warm welcome. That was last year! Meanwhile, the media is full
of the refugee crisis. Our city, too. More than 60 million people are leaving
their countries. Germany and some European countries are overstrained in
handling the arriving people. We had the first minus degrees two days ago.
Winter is coming and we lack a housing crisis. In Germany, it is getting
somehow discomfort. The politicians don’t show up with solutions. The
demonstrations are increasing dramatically. Last week 200.000 people have been
protesting in Magdeburg – 100.000 pro and 100.000 contra the asylum politics.
Civic society is getting nervous and afraid. Could you imagine that their could
be a simple solution which can help immediately and counteract the problem?
Being daily involved as a volunteering social assistant in helping refugees, I
was asking myself for several months – how might we change this difficult
situation? And I will never forget the day, again a family was brought from a
camp and being in a hurry to fill-out the documents, the ballpoint pen cracked
into two pieces. Meanwhile, we were already communicating via mobiles and
Google Translate in about 30 languages, but for bureaucracy we still need tons
of paper and ballpoint pens! The refugees mostly standing next, not knowing
what is going on, not knowing what will happen with them. Why don’t we just use
digital technology and make the refugees active partners in the process? They
all own a mobile and a good one, because they need to find their way and want
to survive the escape from their home countries. Why don’t we just give them
the App – they can choose their language, be informed about the new systems,
have basic information about their new home country. They could even start to
learn the language in advance or while waiting for days in refugee camps. If
you further imagine that the app will connect all appropriate stakeholders plus
volunteers – even every single small local Government will profit as we are
finally going to have digital technology in all city halls. So what do you
think, shall we try to finance more ballpoint pens or shall we change refugees
from petitioners to designers of the Future? Let us make the change and help to
keep the social freedom in Europe.<span><br/></span>Kurzbeschreibung</span> <p><br/></p><p>Hallo, mein Name ist Anette Pekrul.

<h2><em>Unser Ziel/Wirkung</em></h2>
<p>• Wir können es schaffen, aus der aktuellen Zuwanderungs-Überforderung einen schnellen, effizienten und strukturierten Ankommens- und Migrationsprozess zu gestalten, Tausenden, wenn nicht Millionen von Menschen helfen und so einen Beitrag zum Erhalt unseres sozialen Friedens leisten.<br/>• Vernetzung und Kooperation von öffentlichen Einrichtungen (Kommunen, Institutionen, Behörden), sozial- und privatwirtschaftlichen Unternehmen, Soziallotsen, Geflüchteten und ehrenamtlichen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern<br/>• IP-basiertes Integrationsmanagement inklusive Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe für Geflüchtete und Ehrenamtliche</p>
<h2><em>Wieviel Geld wir brauchen und wofür</em></h2>
<p>Wir benötigen <strong>63.000,- Euro</strong>, die wie folgt eingesetzt werden:<br/>• <strong>Honorar-Kosten</strong> für externe Mitarbeiter und Mitgestalter der App für 3 Programmierer, 1 Designer, 30 Übersetzer, 2 Assistenten - <em>75 Prozent (47.250,- Euro)</em><br/>• <strong>9-Sitzer Bus</strong> (gebraucht) für Behörden-Fahrten und Transport von Spenden wie zum Beispiel Möbeln, Kleidung, Spielzeug - <em>10 Prozent (7.500,- Euro)</em><br/><span><strong>• Anschaffungs- und Organisationskosten</strong> für zahlreiche Kleinigkeiten, die uns den Freiraum für die Programmierung der Software geben. Zum Beispiel Fahrten zu Behörden, Kauf von dringend Notwendigem bei der Ankunft von Flüchtlingen (mal fehlen Lebensmittel, weil selbst die Tafel keine mehr hat; Schmerzmittel werden benötigt oder es fehlt ein Kinderwagen, dann wieder etwas anderes) - <em>5 Prozent</em> <em>(3.150,- Euro)</em> <br/><br/>Sollten wir das Funding-Ziel nicht erreichen, würden wir die Spenden natürlich auch für unsere Flüchtlingshilfe einsetzen und auch veröffentlichen, was wir damit finanzieren. An unserer Software arbeiten wir dann natürlich dennoch weiter.</span></p>

Die Anwendung beginnt bei der Ankunft der Geflüchteten in Deutschland, unterstützt die Verteilung auf die Landkreise und steuert ab der Meldung der Ankunft bei den Kommunen den Ankommensprozess. Soziallotsen werden in den Kommunen informiert und „übernehmen“ die Ankommenden. Durch die Soziallotsen werden die Ankommenden dann mit Unterstützung der Integrationsmanagement-App in der Landessprache begrüßt und detaillierte Daten werden erfasst, der Zugang zum Online-Deutschkurs freigeschaltet, etc. ... Da die Soziallotsen bei behördlichen Gängen begleiten, haben Sie die beste Information über den Sachstand im Asylverfahren. Die Daten werden im Intranet aktualisiert und stehen somit zum Beispiel dem Jobcenter, der Schule oder Kita zur Verfügung. Der Asylbewerber weiß durch das Intranet, was er als nächsten Schritt erledigen muss und kann viele Informationen über die Deutsche Kultur, Werte und unser System einfach in seiner Landessprache nachlesen und aktiv mitwirken. Außerdem enthält das Intranet Kontaktdaten und ermöglicht auch die direkte Kommunikation – so zum Beispiel zu Menschen aus dem gleichen Herkunftsland oder Sprachraum.
Für Führungspersönlichkeiten wie zum Beispiel Innenminister, Landräte oder Bürgermeister wird auf Tastendruck eine Gesamtübersicht der Situation in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich möglich.

Unser Ziel/Wirkung
• Wir können es schaffen, aus der aktuellen Zuwanderungs-Überforderung einen schnellen, effizienten und strukturierten Ankommens- und Migrationsprozess zu gestalten, Tausenden, wenn nicht Millionen von Menschen helfen und so einen Beitrag zum Erhalt unseres sozialen Friedens leisten.• Vernetzung und Kooperation von öffentlichen Einrichtungen (Kommunen, Institutionen, Behörden), sozial- und privatwirtschaftlichen Unternehmen, Soziallotsen, Geflüchteten und ehrenamtlichen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern• IP-basiertes Integrationsmanagement inklusive Hilfe zur Selbsthilfe für Geflüchtete und Ehrenamtliche
Wieviel Geld wir brauchen und wofür
Wir benötigen 63.000,- Euro, die wie folgt eingesetzt werden:• Honorar-Kosten für externe Mitarbeiter und Mitgestalter der App für 3 Programmierer, 1 Designer, 30 Übersetzer, 2 Assistenten - 75 Prozent (47.250,- Euro)• 9-Sitzer Bus (gebraucht) für Behörden-Fahrten und Transport von Spenden wie zum Beispiel Möbeln, Kleidung, Spielzeug - 10 Prozent (7.500,- Euro)• Anschaffungs- und Organisationskosten für zahlreiche Kleinigkeiten, die uns den Freiraum für die Programmierung der Software geben. Zum Beispiel Fahrten zu Behörden, Kauf von dringend Notwendigem bei der Ankunft von Flüchtlingen (mal fehlen Lebensmittel, weil selbst die Tafel keine mehr hat; Schmerzmittel werden benötigt oder es fehlt ein Kinderwagen, dann wieder etwas anderes) - 5 Prozent (3.150,- Euro) Sollten wir das Funding-Ziel nicht erreichen, würden wir die Spenden natürlich auch für unsere Flüchtlingshilfe einsetzen und auch veröffentlichen, was wir damit finanzieren. An unserer Software arbeiten wir dann natürlich dennoch weiter.

<h3>In Good Faith </h3>
<p>Talking about race in the United States is difficult and necessary. White people feel attacked as they confront privilege, guilt and anger. Black people are tired of explaining why their lives matter. The result feels like a mine field, so that even would-be allies withdraw into the safety of their own racial group.</p>
<p>In good faith, a black woman and a white man started talking as we watched the United States convulse with racial upheaval and during a contentious presidential election and its divisive aftermath.</p>
<p>Through our idiosyncratic process of listening, hearing and recognizing productive difference, we were cracked open by new and sometimes difficult insights about ourselves and who we choose to call “other.”</p>
<p>We created this project to show how its possible to leave our respective silos and at least shout across the prairie. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>These conversations need a home, other than on our respective laptops. We are creating a website, e-book and limited-edition podcast.

<p>We need to raise $5,000 to make that happen.</p>

<h3>Why We Can't Wait </h3>
<p>We cannot afford to remain in respective silos of silence, bigotry and ignorance. Political and social forces threaten to further divide us, so that it becomes harder for like-minded people to resist oppression and tyranny. </p>
<p>We aren't saying that by having a conversation with someone who doesn't look like you or have the same background will impeach Trump, eliminate racism, and make the world a better place. But we are saying that we each have to try. This is what this project attempts to do, why we need your help and ask you to join the conversation. </p>
<h3>We Are Not Experts </h3>

<p>We really can't say this enough. In fact, it's plastered on nearly every page of the website. </p>
<p>Kerra Bolton is a political communications consultant, writer and artist. A.J. Hartley is the Russell Robinson Professor of Shakespeare Studies at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte and best-selling novelist. Nothing in those descriptions say ""qualified to talk about race."" </p>
<p>But real race conversations, the ones that happen outside the glare of television lights, happen between ordinary people who are trying to make sense of themselves and each other. That's one of the many reasons why these conversations are messy. </p>
<p>In the messiness is also a story about a friendship that grows as people grapple with race -- one of the most divisive, difficult and personal subjects. We fight...a lot. We also laugh a lot. We want to show people that it's possible to have difficult conversations and remain friends. We need your help to make this happen.</p>

<h3>About Lucia</h3>
<p>Hello. I am a mother, entrepreneur, and distance runner. I am also the granddaughter of immigrants. This September I will attempt to set the self-supported Fastest Known Time (FKT) on the Oregon Coast Trail. The trail stretches from the Columbia River some 400 miles south to the California border. There will be low points—times when pain or fear or exhaustion make the whole idea seem stupid. And that is when I will remember that this expedition is a privilege, a choice. That is not the case for thousands of immigrant families who endure long, dangerous, exhausting journeys to reach the United States. These families have made unimaginable sacrifices in pursuit of the American Dream. There is nothing more American than that.</p>
<p>Now more than ever, immigrant families need legal and community support to stay safe and together. That's why I am using this run to raise money for the Immigration Counseling and Advocacy Program (ICAP) run by Lutheran Community Services in Yamhill County, Oregon.</p>
<p>This spring I attended ICAP's Fiesta en la Plaza and heard firsthand from immigrant families who are safe and together thanks to the work of ICAP. It was clear that ICAP is more than services. The staff and volunteers—many immigrants and refugees themselves—play a crucial role in helping new families feel welcome and valued in the community.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your gift of support restores hope and helps our immigrant friends and neighbors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reunite with their families</li>
<li>Protect their children against deportation</li>
<li>Realize the dream of becoming US Citizens</li>
<li>Find sanctuary through crime victim visas</li>
<li>Experience the advantage of consistent case management</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Your Donation Will Do:</h3>
<p>Every gift helps us support the immigrant community of Yamhill County:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50  for an immigrant's citizenship classes. </li>
<li>$100 pays for outreach events, empowering immigrants to know and access their rights.</li>
<li>$250 Provides DACA Assistance to a young adult brought to U.S. as a child to gain legal status.</li>
<li>$500 Assists a crime victim in obtaining a non-immigrant Visa.</li>

I came out to my family at the age of 12. They were a bit shocked but suspected that. Since then they were cheering me up to find my prince charming, even giving a lift at night to a local gay club. It took me some time but after numerous dates and shorter or longer relationships I found my perfect match at the age of 18.

<p><strong>Resumen/Summary</strong></p>
<p>La <strong>Convención de las Naciones Unidas</strong> <strong>sobre los Derechos del Niño (CDN),</strong> reconoce a la <strong>familia</strong> ""como grupo fundamental de la sociedad y medio natural para el crecimiento y el bienestar de todos sus miembros, y en particular de los niños"", y afirma que el niño, para el pleno y armonioso desarrollo de su personalidad, debe crecer en el seno de la familia, en un ambiente de felicidad, amor y comprensión. Adicionalmente establece que se deben realizar todos los esfuerzos necesarios para lograr que los niños permanezcan con su familia, se reintegren a ella, o en su defecto, se debe encontrar otra solución apropiada y permanente.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, por diferentes variables como la pobreza, migración, hacinamiento, violencia intrafamiliar, consumo de alcohol y drogas, o la situación de salud de padres y madres, el riesgo de desintegración familiar se incrementa, vulnerando de esta manera los derechos de los niños y niñas.</p>
<p><i>The <strong>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, </strong>recognizes the <strong>family</strong> “as main group of the society and natural environment for the growth and welfare of its members, and specifically, children”, and says that in order to get the full and harmonious development of their personality, they have to grow within a family, in a cheerful, loving and understanding environment. It also establishes that all the needed efforts should be done to make children stay with their families, reintegrate to them, otherwise a proper and permanent solution should be found.</i></p>
<p><i>However, due to different reasons such as poverty, migration, overcrowding, family violence, alcohol and drugs consumption or fathers and mothers’ health, the risk of family disintegration increases, violating this way children’s rights.</i></p>
<p>Esta situación en Bolivia es alarmante y se refleja en las siguientes estadísticas:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 de cada 10 niños y niñas viven en situación de pobreza.</li>
<li>3 de cada 10 niños y niñas sufren desnutrición crónica antes de los 5 años.</li>
<li>8 de cada 10 niños y niñas sufren violencia (física, psicológica y sexual)</li>
<li>Más de 165.000 familias están en riesgo de separarse.</li>
</ul>

La Convención de las Naciones Unidas sobre los Derechos del Niño (CDN), reconoce a la familia ""como grupo fundamental de la sociedad y medio natural para el crecimiento y el bienestar de todos sus miembros, y en particular de los niños"", y afirma que el niño, para el pleno y armonioso desarrollo de su personalidad, debe crecer en el seno de la familia, en un ambiente de felicidad, amor y comprensión. Adicionalmente establece que se deben realizar todos los esfuerzos necesarios para lograr que los niños permanezcan con su familia, se reintegren a ella, o en su defecto, se debe encontrar otra solución apropiada y permanente.
Sin embargo, por diferentes variables como la pobreza, migración, hacinamiento, violencia intrafamiliar, consumo de alcohol y drogas, o la situación de salud de padres y madres, el riesgo de desintegración familiar se incrementa, vulnerando de esta manera los derechos de los niños y niñas.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, recognizes the family “as main group of the society and natural environment for the growth and welfare of its members, and specifically, children”, and says that in order to get the full and harmonious development of their personality, they have to grow within a family, in a cheerful, loving and understanding environment. It also establishes that all the needed efforts should be done to make children stay with their families, reintegrate to them, otherwise a proper and permanent solution should be found.
However, due to different reasons such as poverty, migration, overcrowding, family violence, alcohol and drugs consumption or fathers and mothers’ health, the risk of family disintegration increases, violating this way children’s rights.
Esta situación en Bolivia es alarmante y se refleja en las siguientes estadísticas:

6 de cada 10 niños y niñas viven en situación de pobreza.
3 de cada 10 niños y niñas sufren desnutrición crónica antes de los 5 años.
8 de cada 10 niños y niñas sufren violencia (física, psicológica y sexual)
Más de 165.000 familias están en riesgo de separarse.

This situation in Bolivia is alarming and is expressed in the following numbers:

6 out of 10 children live in poverty.
3 out of 10 children suffer chronic malnutrition before turning 5 years old.
8 out of 10 children suffer violence (physic, psychologic and sexual)
More than 165.000 families are at risk of separating.

Es por esta razón que Aldeas Infantes SOS trabaja en Bolivia más de 48 años en la prevención del abandono y la restitución del derecho a una familia de niños y niñas que perdieron el cuidado de sus padres.
That is why, SOS Children’s Villages works in Bolivia for more than 48 years, preventing the child abandonment and trying to restitute the right to a family for children who lost the care of their parents.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The World Punjabi Congress (WPC) is a cultural nonprofit organization established in 1984 in Lahore with the purpose of promoting languages and culture for the attainment of peace and tolerance. The WPC has to date, organized more than 25 international conferences in Pakistan, India, UK, Austria, Canada, Sweden, Netherlands, Denmark, France and other countries.</p>
<p>World Punjabi Congress aims to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nurturing cultural diversity through the promotion of national languages of Pakistan</li>
<li>Establishing peaceful relations between India and Pakistan through literary and cultural exchanges</li>
<li>Establishing linkages between Pakistani writers and writers of the world for the promotion of global peace and understanding</li>
<li>Providing a platform for dialogue among researchers and intellectuals for the dissemination of Sufi and cultural heritage of Pakistan</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Aims</h3>
<p>World Punjabi Congress has taken an initiative to organize a 3-day ‘International Conference on Peace’, in Lahore, Pakistan in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>The Conference is the most effective way of persuading writers and intellectuals from Pakistan and all over the world towards achieving a goal of peace. It is meant to involve opinion-makers of the civil society and the common man of Pakistan in generating ideas regarding international peace with a predominant focus on Pakistan.</p>
<p>This mega-event will help consolidate efforts to show Pakistan's commitment towards promoting peace, harmony and a culture of tolerance. The Conference will also aim to disseminate the message of Sufism throughout the world, and to dispel the wrong notions associated with pseudo-religious propaganda that leads to extremism and intolerance. Pakistan is known all over for all the wrong reasons. With this Conference, we want to repudiate such wrongly perceived notions and bring out the soft, liberal and peaceful image of Pakistan.</p>

Viele philippinische Kinder werden zu Hause missbraucht. Sie ziehen es vor, ihren eigenen Weg auf der Straße zu gehen, anstatt in der Unterdrückung zu Hause zu bleiben. Tausende Kinder machen diesen mutigen Schritt, leiden dann aber körperlich und seelisch im täglichen Überlebenskampf.Meine Freundinnen Katherine, Marie und Sara waren auf den Philippinen und sind entschlossen, sich diesen Kindern anzunehmen. Sie haben die Initiative ‚Home4Kids‘ in Österreich* gegründet. Sie haben mich darum gebeten ein Kinderheim zu entwerfen, das zu diesen Kindern und zu diesem Land passt. Um der dramatischen Situation dieser Kinder zu begegnen und ihnen Raum zum Heilen zu geben, bitte ich Euch um Unterstützung. Damit wir helfen können, brauchen wir eure HilfeIch habe bereits den Entwurf des universellen „Mutterschiffs“ entwickelt, in dem 32 Kinder leben, spielen und lernen werden. Den Entwurf habe ich bereits der Initiative und den Kindern gespendet.Es sollen mindestens 7 Gebäude gebaut werden: Kinderhäuser, eine Schule, ein Speisesaal, Gästehäuser und ein Garten, in dem die Kinder ihr eigenes Bio-Gemüse anbauen. Jetzt geht es darum, die nächsten Schritte zu realisieren. Für den Bauprozess und weitere Entwürfe ist es wichtig, vor Ort zu sein. Wir bitten Dich um finanzielle Unterstützung für mein Team und mich – Reisekosten und Unterkunft - damit wir vor Ort beginnen können. 4500, - sind erforderlich.Hilf uns mit Deiner Spende und freu Dich darauf zu sehen, wie wir Healing Architektur umsetzen und Home4Kids wächst. Der ImpactAls ich von meinen Freundinnen über die Situation auf den Philippinen hörte, ihre Sicht auf diese Kinder und ihre Vision für sie kennen lernte, bekam ich einen neuen Einblick in „globale Verantwortung“. Wir möchten unseren Beitrag dazu leisten, dass diese Straßenkinder zu selbstbewussten, erfolgreichen und glücklichen Menschen werden, die ihre Lebensziele erreichen. ""Probleme können niemals mit derselben Denkweise gelöst werden, mit der sie entstanden sind...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone,<br/><br/>My name is Iris Koh and I’m from Singapore. I started the Healing The Divide initiative in July this year to present the other side of the vaccine story so people can have medical informed consent before taking the vaccine. <br/><br/>In our core, we believe openness is required for facts to be confirmed and verified. While sharing and reading news is one of the processes we must do, we also believe that at times seemingly extreme measures have to be taken. Like taking institutions, corporations, the press, medical institutions and governments to task in the court of law under oath to clarify facts and to be made responsible for all the information they have released in the course of their work.</p>
<p>Truth is a herculean task not for the faint of heart. While open discussion is essential, it is not sufficient.<br/><br/>Healing the Divide stands for Unity, Truth and Empathy. We protect our rights to live in a society where diversity is celebrated especially regarding our medical health.</p>
<p>As this is evolving, the amount that we are seeking will help fund and support the work that we do for the next 3 months. When you support this, you will be supporting the initiatives that we have to protect medical freedom in our society.<br/><br/>Thank you for your support and together we can heal the divide and create a society based on justice and equality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>5)To continue our work to investigate, write and present the other side of the vaccine story in our social media / website and share information with the community. </p>
<p>6) Reaching out to the victims injured during vaccination to assist them to tell their stories so as to inform the public about dangers of vaccine and also to put pressure on the government on their claims.</p>
<p>7) Secondarily, to allow them to reach a bigger public so that they may receive financial assistance where necessary to alleviate the pain &amp; suffering as a result of vaccination.<br/><br/><strong>Highest aims</strong></p>
<p>1) To heal the divide caused by misinformation and narrative-based reporting instead of fact-based reports. Truth will heal the divide in our country.<br/><br/>2) Research and evidence from many countries have already shown that simple medication like Ivermectin, Vitamin C, D etc can stop covid right now.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

To allow alternative medication to be used in the treatment of covid. 
To pursue fair medical compensation for the victims injured during and after vaccination - if it can be ascertained in Court on a balance of probabilities that it is due to the experimental vaccine.


Risks & Challenges
During the process of realizing the mission and goals of our project, we would be initiating legal actions on organizations & prominent individuals. The risk of a counter legal lawsuit from these organizations and individuals is present. 

The founder and the plaintiffs may be counter-sued.
The founder is risking her name, business, and potential income by taking on this initiative.

The government currently is the biggest employer in the country and thus it is difficult to find people who will speak up openly / do the work.The organization, along with its volunteers engage at least 2 law firms to provide us legal services, and to protect us legally. Of cos, this is a huge global problem that doctors, lawyers and citizens around the world are standing up against and over in Singapore we wish to do our own small part to stop vaccine passport mandates in our country.

Between January and December 2015, over a million people (mostly refugees) arrived in Europe, making their way to cities and towns such as Calais in France, in the hopes of finding safety and stability for themselves and their families. Given Brighton’s proximity to Calais, a small group of passionate Brighton-based educators began working together to see how they could help to address the educational needs of the Calais-based refugees, and, with that, the School Bus Project was born.</p><p>With the support of donors like you, we have:</p><ul>
<li>developed <strong>online and in-person training resources and activities</strong> to support individuals working on refugee education and trained about 60 volunteer educators</li>
<li>raised funds to buy a <strong>double decker yellow bus and converted it into a mobile school</strong>, which was deployed as part of a pilot project in the Jungle Camp in Calais from September 2016 until the camp's closure</li>

<p><i>An appeal video made by the Key Stage 3 pupils at Charter International School, Bangkok, Thailand, to raise awareness of the current refugee crisis and the work of the School Bus Project to provide education and hope to thousands of displaced people.</i></p>
</div><p> </p></div>","About the School Bus ProjectThe School Bus Project was founded in Brighton in September 2015 in response to the growing refugee crisis as it is manifested in Europe. Between January and December 2015, over a million people (mostly refugees) arrived in Europe, making their way to cities and towns such as Calais in France, in the hopes of finding safety and stability for themselves and their families. Given Brighton’s proximity to Calais, a small group of passionate Brighton-based educators began working together to see how they could help to address the educational needs of the Calais-based refugees, and, with that, the School Bus Project was born.With the support of donors like you, we have:
developed online and in-person training resources and activities to support individuals working on refugee education and trained about 60 volunteer educators
raised funds to buy a double decker yellow bus and converted it into a mobile school, which was deployed as part of a pilot project in the Jungle Camp in Calais from September 2016 until the camp's closure
provided key life-saving and life-sustaining lessons and resources in collaboration with a range of partners
raised awareness about the refugee crisis among schools, communities, government, and international organisations
What do we need the money for?Since the founding of the School Bus Project, we have come to realise that we can maximise our impact by focusing on the development and delivery of guidance and training for a range of educators, the identification and deployment of no-, low-, and high-tech educational resources in various refugee contexts, and collaboration with individuals, groups, and partner organisations to better support education delivery.If you make a donation to the School Bus Project, you will be helping us to:
cover the costs of training and providing guidance and support to educators working with refugees across Europe
identify and/or develop a range of no-, low-, and high-tech educational resources for deployment where they are needed most

support individuals, groups, and partner organisations wishing to set up their own mobile learning spaces or further develop their own educational interventions
support the integration of refugees and vulnerable migrants in mainstream schools and communities and promote social cohesion

raise awareness about the refugee crisis in the UK and internationally

<div>The Equipo Forense Internacional-International Field Initiatives and Forensic Training (EFI-IFIFT) is a Guatemalan/Canadian forensic anthropology team consisting of six individuals who conduct work in Guatemala. The EFI-IFIFT team formed in May 2015. Together, we have a combined sixty years of experience in forensic archaeology, forensic anthropology as well as socio-cultural anthropology. Our mission is to support both the justice system in Guatemala through expert forensic reporting, as well as the human rights of victims of the armed conflict in Guatemala. This is accomplished by retrieving the remains of loved ones who fell victim to <i>La Violencia, </i>or armed conflict<i>. </i>This is<i> </i>a time period between 1960 and 1996, when 250,000 people were massacred, 45,000 individuals were disappeared, and 1.5 million individuals were displaced from their homes and communities.  Since May 2015, the EFI-IFIFT team have recovered six remains in two separate communities of Nebaj, and San Juan Cotzal in the province of Quiche. But there are many, many more remains left to retrieve in these communities.</div>
<div>The campaign is raising funds to support the exhumation process within Nebaj and San Juan Cotzal. This includes gathering information about those who are buried (the historical memory), the exhumation (recovery) of the remains, the analysis of the bones, and the proper inhumation, or burial for the family members. The transcriptions of the historical memory, the analysis and remains, as well as any images that are collected during the process will be given to the families,  and the Public Ministry as a public record of what occurred to the families and communities of Nebaj and San Juan Cotzal during <i>La Violencia.</i>
</div>
<div>Your contribution will help bring closure to families and assist in the grieving process. It is important to note, the burials to be exhumed are considered ""closed cases"", this means that the cases have more information on both the victim(s) and the place(s) where they were buried.  Families know where their loved ones were buried during the armed conflict. The information gathered will assist in bringing justice to communities that have been waiting for more than thirty years, and tell the story of what many communities have lost, </div>
<div> </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To date, the EFI-IFIFT team has supported the project through personal funding of $25,000.00, but there is still much to accomplish. The breakdown of $50,000.00 we are crowdfunding for encompasses the 90 day period for the exhumation process, from the initial interviews, to the Inhumation of remains :</p>

<h3>Hungary's future is at stake.</h3>
</div><div><p><b>We need your help and your financial support to fund our referendum initiative against the autocratic regime of Prime Minister Viktor Orban so that Hungary can finally escape its outcast status. </b></p></div><div>
<h3><br/></h3> <p></p>
</div>The world has already figured out what Orban’s nasty little game is. They know that he is a corrupt liar, that his relatives and acquaintances are getting rich on stolen money, that he ignores the norms of European civilization and governs Hungary like a dictator. We are ashamed of him. But until now, neither Hungary nor Europe have had enough willpower or determination to stop the madness from escalating. <br/><br/>We, the founder-members of the New Hungarian Republic (""Új Magyar Köztársaság"" in Hungarian) Association, an organisation built on the foundations of recent civil demonstrations, have decided to take our country back, step by step. Our referendum initiative is designed to give everybody who wants change an opportunity to unite. <br/><br/>For the first time under (Orban's party) Fidesz’s rule and despite laws made more severe by Orban's parliament and its non-impartial bodies, we have come up with five questions which can be decided upon by the Hungarian people. <br/><br/>These questions get to the heart of what Orban’s corrupt system is all about. So for example, we are asking whether we should allow politicians to conceal their stolen wealth by putting it in their family members’ names; whether we should allow one of Orbán’s cronies to tax our businesses; whether we should put up with a law that prevents our children from being properly educated; whether we should suffer any more when we get ill; and whether politicians should enjoy greater rights than the people they govern. <br/><br/><b>Our proposed petition anticipates a successful referendum. And a successful referendum is our best chance of creating an opposition capable of governing. <br/></b><br/>First we must collect at least 200,000 signatures of support for our cause. If we succeed, Parliament is obliged to order a referendum. <br/><br/>Our petition - set to launch in mid-July – and the subsequent campaign of opposition both need to be properly funded. <br/><br/>We will do what needs to be done to rescue Hungary from its fate. We are counting on you, too! <b>Please support our “Autocracy-demolishing referendum” for the New Hungarian Republic with your donation and share our appeal with your friends as well! </b><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>----------------------------------</b></div><div>

<br/><span><b>Támogatásodat és pénzbeli adományodat kérjük Orbán Viktor autokratikus rendszere elleni népszavazási kezdeményezésünkhöz, hogy hazánk végre kiszabaduljon a párialétből. </b></span>
</div><div>
<span></span> </div><div>
<span></span><b></b><p style=""display: inline !important;"">Orbánt és rendszerét már kiismerte a világ. Tudják, hogy hazug és korrupt, hogy rokonai és ismerősei lopott pénzből gazdagodnak, hogy fittyet hány az európai civilizációs normákra és fél-ázsiai diktátorok ízlése szerint kormányozza Magyarországot – szégyenkezünk is miatta eleget. Ám eddig sem itthon, sem Európában nem volt elegendő elszántság és akarat, mely képes lett volna megállítani a fokozódó tébolyt. </p>
<b></b>
</div><p><br/>Mi, a közelmúlt civil tüntetéseinek bázisán szerveződött Új Magyar Köztársaság Egyesület tagjai elhatároztuk, hogy lépésről lépésre segítünk visszafoglalni Magyarországot. Népszavazási kezdeményezésünkkel lehetőséget adunk arra, hogy a változásra vágyó, de szertefutó akaratok összefonódhassanak. <br/><br/>Az Orbán parlamentje által megnehezített törvényi feltételek és a részrehajló testületek ellenére sikerült elérnünk, hogy a benyújtott két tucat kezdeményezés közül – először a Fidesz-uralom évei során – öt kérdésben a nép dönthessen! <br/><br/>Ezek a kérdések a rendszer lényegéről szólnak.

Hungary's future is at stake.
We need your help and your financial support to fund our referendum initiative against the autocratic regime of Prime Minister Viktor Orban so that Hungary can finally escape its outcast status. 
 
The world has already figured out what Orban’s nasty little game is. They know that he is a corrupt liar, that his relatives and acquaintances are getting rich on stolen money, that he ignores the norms of European civilization and governs Hungary like a dictator. We are ashamed of him. But until now, neither Hungary nor Europe have had enough willpower or determination to stop the madness from escalating. We, the founder-members of the New Hungarian Republic (""Új Magyar Köztársaság"" in Hungarian) Association, an organisation built on the foundations of recent civil demonstrations, have decided to take our country back, step by step. Our referendum initiative is designed to give everybody who wants change an opportunity to unite. For the first time under (Orban's party) Fidesz’s rule and despite laws made more severe by Orban's parliament and its non-impartial bodies, we have come up with five questions which can be decided upon by the Hungarian people. These questions get to the heart of what Orban’s corrupt system is all about. So for example, we are asking whether we should allow politicians to conceal their stolen wealth by putting it in their family members’ names; whether we should allow one of Orbán’s cronies to tax our businesses; whether we should put up with a law that prevents our children from being properly educated; whether we should suffer any more when we get ill; and whether politicians should enjoy greater rights than the people they govern. Our proposed petition anticipates a successful referendum. And a successful referendum is our best chance of creating an opposition capable of governing. First we must collect at least 200,000 signatures of support for our cause. If we succeed, Parliament is obliged to order a referendum. Our petition - set to launch in mid-July – and the subsequent campaign of opposition both need to be properly funded. We will do what needs to be done to rescue Hungary from its fate. We are counting on you, too! Please support our “Autocracy-demolishing referendum” for the New Hungarian Republic with your donation and share our appeal with your friends as well! ----------------------------------


Magyarország jövőjéről van szó. 
Támogatásodat és pénzbeli adományodat kérjük Orbán Viktor autokratikus rendszere elleni népszavazási kezdeményezésünkhöz, hogy hazánk végre kiszabaduljon a párialétből. 

 
Orbánt és rendszerét már kiismerte a világ. Tudják, hogy hazug és korrupt, hogy rokonai és ismerősei lopott pénzből gazdagodnak, hogy fittyet hány az európai civilizációs normákra és fél-ázsiai diktátorok ízlése szerint kormányozza Magyarországot – szégyenkezünk is miatta eleget. Ám eddig sem itthon, sem Európában nem volt elegendő elszántság és akarat, mely képes lett volna megállítani a fokozódó tébolyt. 

Mi, a közelmúlt civil tüntetéseinek bázisán szerveződött Új Magyar Köztársaság Egyesület tagjai elhatároztuk, hogy lépésről lépésre segítünk visszafoglalni Magyarországot. Népszavazási kezdeményezésünkkel lehetőséget adunk arra, hogy a változásra vágyó, de szertefutó akaratok összefonódhassanak. Az Orbán parlamentje által megnehezített törvényi feltételek és a részrehajló testületek ellenére sikerült elérnünk, hogy a benyújtott két tucat kezdeményezés közül – először a Fidesz-uralom évei során – öt kérdésben a nép dönthessen! Ezek a kérdések a rendszer lényegéről szólnak. Így például arról, hogy engedjük-e a politikusoknak családtagjaik nevén elrejteni a lopott vagyont, hogy tűrjük-e Orbán egyik vazallusának vállalkozásaink megsarcolását, vagy hogy beletörődünk-e abba, hogy törvény korlátozza gyermekeinket a tudás megszerzésében. Hogy elviseljük-e a kiszolgáltatottságot, ha megbetegszünk. És hogy több jog illetheti-e meg másoknál a politikusokat. A sikeres aláírásgyűjtés megelőlegezi a sikeres népszavazást, a sikeres népszavazás pedig megfelelő alkalom a kormányzóképes magyar ellenzék felépítésére is. Elsőként legalább 200 ezer támogató aláírást kell összegyűjtenünk. Ha sikerrel járunk, az országgyűlésnek kötelezően ki kell írnia a népszavazást. A július közepén kezdődő aláírásgyűjtés elindításához és az eredményes kampány lefolytatásához pénzre, sok pénzre van szükség. Mi megtesszük, amit hitünk szerint meg kell tenni Magyarország sorsának jobbra fordításáért. Számítunk rád is! Kérjük, támogasd adományoddal rendszerbontó népszavazásunkat az új magyar köztársaságért, és oszd meg felhívásunkat a barátaiddal is!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><u>The Future Is Voting Tour featuring Jim James</u></h3>
<p>We all know what’s at stake on Election Day. All 435 House seats and 35 Senate seats are up for grabs. And the last two special elections came down to fewer than 2,000 votes -- about the number of students who can pack a large auditorium on campus.</p>
<p>So, Jim James and all the other performers will travel the country, <strong>donating 100% of their time and art</strong> to the cause of turning out voters. None of the artists participating on this tour are being paid.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jim will appear at all six shows; other performers will join for select dates</li>
<li>Candidates of all political affiliations will be invited to participate in Q&amp;A sessions</li>
<li>Funds will directly cover the costs of bringing these events to college campuses at no cost to the students or schools</li>
</ul>
<p>And you can help make it all happen by making a contribution. Moving the artists and staff to <strong>six college markets and campuses</strong> all over the United States is not easy... and it will be expensive, even if no one gets paid. And none of the schools will be charged anything. So, please pitch in what you can.</p>
<p>Any funds raised that exceed the tour expenses will be <strong>donated 100%</strong> to <a href=""https://www.headcount.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>HeadCount</strong></a> to help them continue to support local and campus organizations doing important get-out-the-vote work. We realize that you are being asked to contribute to multiple campaigns and causes in election years. We feel strongly that this is a unique opportunity to <strong>come together as a national community and motivate younger voters</strong> to get out and make their opinions count!</p>
