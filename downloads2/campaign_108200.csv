I dream of things that never were and ask why not?</i>”</p><p>She is strongly persuaded that God Prefers Atheists can suggest a different way to approach religious themes and hopefully inspire to go through life with a more relax attitude.</p><p><strong>ENRICO </strong>is a dynamic kind of guy, with a true passion for filmmaking, photography, anthropology, adventure traveling, art and cultural interchange. </p><p>He likes to call himself a citizen of the world and can hardly stay in the same location for more than a few months on a row, even if he does love being based in London for its multiculturalism.</p><p>He never gets tired of searching for beauty in all its forms combining a dreamy attitude with a down to earth approach to life. At the end of the day the most important thing in life is not to take ourselves too seriously and always have a laughter ready.</p><p>He believes God Prefers Atheists will help the world bond together and see life and religion in a more cheerful way.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT WE DO :</h3><p><u><i><strong>God Prefer Atheists</strong></i></u> is a web series narrated in the form of a TV sit-com style, divided into 7 chapters in representation of the Seven Holy Sacraments of the Church. </p><p>The story describes a family conflicts and everyday life by humorously re-interpreting facts from the Holy Bible focusing on the creation of Humans and the figure of God. More specifically, the trait- d’union between the different episodes is the troubled Father - Son relationship that God and Jesus experience. These two are the main characters that will come across different events through time and space following Bible’s chronology until reaching an unexpected epilogue. </p><p>This web series is a narration in which a grotesque and humorous style, sometimes extreme and brazenly, encounters a delicate pastel cinematography, curated in the slightest details, almost as if to act as a contrast and metaphor of the contradictions inherent in the story itself.</p><p>Many are the events taken from the bible, but revisited in satirical terms, such as man's creation, baptism, crucifixion, and resurrection. Choosing to use actors in flesh and bones, rather than other techniques such as animation, lies in the fact that we wanted to represent what has always been painted as divine in a totally earthly way, close to us and to the idea of ordinary men.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY WE DO IT :</h3><p><i><u><strong>God Prefer Atheists </strong></u></i>is a metaphor intended to represent the abuse of power and the manipulation of the masses perpetrated over the centuries by the Church. The purpose of this project is not to offend the above-mentioned institution, but simply to bring it to a more earthy level showing how, in the end, they are just the sordidness of the single human beings to compromise and contaminate the values at the base of the institution itself and the messages that they convey. </p><p>The idea that inspired us in writing this series is the common vision of how the Church has been created and how it has been managed more as a true business than as a form of faith and love. The end of the story, moreover, provides an important point of reflection regarding the approach with the superiority intrinsic in the concept of God himself to whom men must constantly look at in order to find the final Salvation. The confession of God and his consequent resignation show that in order to reach a more meaningful truth and a deeper sense of life, it is necessary to examine one’s conscience and question it with utmost honesty. The answers that every human being seeks cannot come from the outside nor from above and can not be imposed by others - as the Church suggests - but they can only be sought and found in the depths of each human soul.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">CHARACTERS :</h3><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>GOD </strong></p><p>God is the main character of the serie.<br/>The narrative timeline spans from the events starting with his divorce, passing through the creation of the humans, the beginning of the Church until finally reaching his examination of conscience that will lead to a deep repentance and his resignations.<br/>His profile corresponds to an eccentric intergalactic billionaire entrepreneur, fond lover of laziness and beer with very weak interpersonal skills. God sees himself like a self-made man; he is particularly proud of his achievements and success as well as very jealous of his own spaces, freedom and omnipotency. Not much incline to relationships compromises, he pleasantly avoids any kind of emotional responsibility that may arise.<br/>The only other living being he has a real connection with and to whom allows entering his “comfort zone” is Holy Spirit -his cat-, who’s very independent and therefore easily manageable. He is also the only creature God shows feeling some kindness towards.<br/>At the time of the story, God’s biggest issue is his only -and unwanted- son Jesus, who happens to live a very depressing life failing to keep up with his father’s big expectations. His ex wife’s Sathàna tricked him during the divorce agreement and he ends up with the sole custody of the 6 years old boy.<br/>In fact, by getting rid of his wife, God hopes to be able to resume his old habits represented by cold beers on the sofa and lazy afternoons spent with his cat, instead he finds himself with the burden of growing up a very introverted son with whom he has never really built up a relationship. Being his only heir, however, God hopes that, through his own example, the son can become like him and turn into a strong and successful man. Unfortunately, God’s expectations are denied by the facts showing Jesus as incapable of socializing and integrating, extremely sensitive, absolutely devoid of paternal countenance and of any kind of charism.<br/>During the course of the events we witness an escalation of loss of control by God caused by a growing frustration over the attitude and behaviour of his son.<br/>Finally, God decides to invest in the growing organization created by the humans and called “Church” by paying the apostles to promote his name and persuade the humans to adore him with the triple purpose of nourishing his vanity, gaining incredible amounts of money and getting revenge on his ex-wife by infesting the Earth with fanatics.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOLY SPIRIT </strong></p><p>Narrator’s voice and God’s cat, besides being his favorite creature in the whole Universe.<br/>He is the silent companion of God’s daily routine because he is the only one able to provide him with some good vibes. He shows no affection to anyone other than God and he has very little sympathy for Jesus as he empathizes with his owner’s conflict with his son. Holy Spirit also represents the heavy hand of God; in fact, whenever Jesus exceeds the limit, God sends Holy Spirit to Earth as a warning to his conduct. He will be the only one in charge of God's inheritance.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>JESUS</strong> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Jesus is the fruit of the failed marriage between God and Sathàna.<br/>He is an introverted baby, extremely sensitive and naive. Traumatized by a cold and absent mother and a father distracted by his own omnipotence, Jesus grows up in a silent, emotionally arid and devoid of sociality environment. At an early age he discovers his passion for percussion and, with his drumsticks, spends most of his time clanking on any surface that he can find, caught in an attempt to become the greatest drummer in the whole universe and to obviate the inner and external silent that scares him. The only people who have ever proven to be affectionate to Jesus are God’s housekeeper Mary and her sweetheart, Joseph -God’s gardener- so sorry to see a child so isolated and ignored. Besides the affection of his father's employees, the only beings Jesus falls madly in love with are the humans, created by God in order to distract him from his obsession for percussions. Despite, humans will mistreat Jesus and take advantage of him, he will always keep perceiving them as his only true friends.<br/>He is the only character in the series that goes through a metamorphosis: in fact, we see him 6 years old in the first episode, adult in the second, third, fourth and sixths during his permanence on Earth where from being an introverted and lonely kid he turns into a hippie party animal with a solid social life full of friends and followers and, finally, reincarnated in Kurt Cobain in the seventh episode when, thanks to his father’s pettiness, he has to face again the impossibility of realizing his true real nature.<br/>He will commit suicide in on onrush of sadness and envy after seeing the reflection of Dave Grohl in the mirror, leaving just a letter full of grief to his father.<br/>Jesus is the true victim of the story and represents the scapegoat on which everyone projects his own faults and frustrations.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SATHÀNA - GOD’S WIFE</strong> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Sathàna is God’s wife. Capricious, spoiled and annoying, she represents what the Church has always identified in the Devil. She is a petty woman who has taken advantage of him trying to make the most out of their divorce. After a troubled matrimony, the woman’s only desire is to start over a new life and get rid of her so hard to handle and complex son Jesus. Through a trick she manages to ensure Jesus under God’s sole custody and obtain the property of the whole planet Earth, her favorite holiday resort. God has always hated the Earth as it was the place where he was obliged to spend all his holidays. However, well aware of the affective value that the planet represents for his wife, it turns into a good starting point for revenge and that’s the reason why he will infest it with humans.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ADAM &amp; EVE </strong><br/>Adam &amp; Eve are the first humans created by God in the desperate attempt to distract and entertain his son Jesus.<br/>Being created in God’s image and likeness -drunk in addiction- they embody all his worsts sides. Therefore, Adam and Eve are two stubborn insolents with no respect at all who do not recognize anyone's authority including God himself, thereby triggering his anger.<br/>They spend their time sunbathing, drinking cocktails, and lazing around without denying to subjugate Jesus to any of their requests and to use him to provoke God's wrath and continually challenge his omnipotence, as in the apple episode.<br/>As a result of their disobedience they will be exiled to Earth.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>JOSEPH &amp; MARY </strong></p><p>Joseph &amp; Mary appear in the first episode respectively as the gardener of God’s home with the passion for fishing and Jesus’s nanny and God's housekeeper.<br/>They both present a docile, obedient and obliging character.<br/>They feel such an extreme pity and affection for Jesus as a child that they will be the chosen ones to go with him to Earth as his fictitious parents.</p><p>Joseph will go through difficult times when he will finally realize to be obliged to grow up the son of someone else and, after meeting with the Three Wise Men on the night of Jesus' birth and having received a good amount of hallucinogenic substances, he will get lost in the desert leaving Mary by herself with the child.</p><p>Henceforth we will no longer see Mary expect for a few frames at the time of Jesus’s crucifixion when she cries her son by the foot of the cross.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PETER</strong> <br/>Peter is the alter ego of Jesus and is the devout servant of God.<br/>An all-round obedient and ambitious but with zero personality and subjugated by power.<br/>God is proud of his adoration and for this he entrusts him with His personal and important tasks, certain of his total fidelity. Peter heavily envy Jesus because he would like it to be him the designated heir instead of a useless child unable to bring forth the possibilities being offered. Following all the troubles caused by Jesus on Earth, Peter is sent there as an infiltrator among the 12 disciples in order to reaffirm God's authority.<br/>In order to be more in control of the situation he then becomes Jesus' confidant and gains his trust. In fact, as soon as Jesus dies, Pietro inherits the role of leader of the 12 apostles. Peter will then become the first Pope of the Church and vice God that will continue serving him faithfully until the day of his resignation.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MARY MAGDALENE </strong><br/>Mary Magdalene is the daughter of the High State Official Pontius Pilate and one and only love of Jesus. She is an absent-minded girl who essentially wants to have fun and aims at who offers her more.<br/>Despite her father cannot stand all the boys buzzing around her, especially that longhair hippie of Jesus, Mary Magdalene keeps taking advantage of him, and, after the resurrection, she convinces him to take her to God’s place. Once living at the Mansion, when Jesus shows the first signs of post-Earth depression, she is be the first trying to dissuade him from the idea of returning there but with no success. Finally, having obtained immortality by God, she quits Jesus at the very last minute as she prefers going hitchhiking throughout the Universe.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>JUDAS</strong> </p><p>Judas is one of Jesus disciples and his fellow drinking buddy. We meet him for the first time during a rave in Palestine and then we see him again during the last supper when we find out he is secretly having an affair with Mary Magdalene. After leaving Jesus completely wasted at the tavern, he bumps into two of Pontius Pilate's guards while he’s going back home with Mary Madgalene. The guards mistaken him for Jesus and want to bring him in to Pilate in order to have him executed. Terrorized, Judas, in order to save himself, reveals to the guards where to find Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SUPPORTING CHARACTERS </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>KING HEROD </strong><br/>A ruthless king who cannot have heirs. He commands the murder of all male babies of his kingdom, in the grip of one of his tyrannical sprints.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THREE WISE MEN </strong><br/>Three hipsters freaks in search of lysergic experiences in the desert.<br/>While in hallucinogenic delirium they find Giuseppe, who smokes and moans outside the stable where Jesus was born. They are really moved by the state of the poor man and will share with him part of their drug stockpile.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>JOHN THE BAPTIST </strong><br/>John the Baptist is a regular raver. He appears in the 2nd episode during a party in Palestine where he meets Jesus in delirious conditions. Moved by compassion, he tries to help him recover by repeatedly soaking him in sea water.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>12 DISCIPLES (future Catholic Church preachers) </strong><br/>Considered by Jesus as his family, the 12 are lost souls without a home or a job, who find in Jesus a sustenance because of his wealth and the miracles he performs. After Jesus death by crucifixion, they find themselves with no money therefore are easily bought by Peter and God and will agree to promote the doctrine of the Catholic Church in exchange for a high monthly salary and material goods (wealth).</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PONTIUS PILATE </strong><br/>Pontius Pilate is a High State Official, n love with his uniform and the power that it gives him. Extremely jealous of his daughter, he hates all the guys around her, especially the hippie hiccups like Jesus. He loves to establish his authority and therefore punishes Jesus to death, who has repeatedly challenged him by falling in love with her daughter.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>THE STORY</strong></u></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EPISODE 1 - MATRIMONY</strong> </p><p>The episode opens on God’s office where, in the presence of his wife, he is signing the divorce papers. The scene is seen from the perspective of the Holy Spirit -God’s cat- who enters the room and walks towards God’s feet where it starts rubbing on. Once convinced to be finally free from his annoying ex wife, God realizes that he had not paid enough attention to the terms of the divorce clauses and, not only his wife has obtained the total property of the planet Earth, but he is also finding himself stuck with the sole custody of his son Jesus obsessed by one and only dream: becoming a drummer. Without any desire to be a Father, God finds himself drunk during his first face to face dinner with his son. God is puzzled by the child’s behavior and does not understand why he is so introverted, and asocial and he feels already exasperated by Jesus’ obsession for percussions. In the grip of desperation and extreme drunkenness, he tries a way out to distract Jesus from drums by creating some creatures with some random materials found in the kitchen.</p><p>The very next day he releases humans in his garden -also called Eden- which is full of beautiful fruit trees and has a huge swimming pool in it. Once in the garden, God warns the humans about the terrible punishments they will face should they eat from the Apple Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and the Evil - which is his sole solemn property- and introduces them to his son. </p><p>Jesus is ecstatic and begins showing clear signs of improvement by socializing and playing with Adam &amp; Eve. Actually, the latter are two extremely hedonistic people with no respect at all for authority and in practice they just use Jesus to mock him or force him in doing all the forbidden and funny things. Pretty soon, through a trick, Eve convinces Jesus to take an apple from his father's forbidden tree. Right after, Peter runs to God in order to report the fact. God goes mad and immediately convenes his son together with Adam and Eve in his office. </p><p>Once in the presence of God, the two humans blame Jesus without even giving him the possibility to speak or defend himself. Suspicious about Adam and Eve’s behavior, God asks for the consultation of a special witness: the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Following the revelations made by the Tree, he establishes to exile humans on Earth with the dual purpose of punishing them and bothering the ex-wife. </p><p>Jesus is super saddened by humans departure. In fact, even though they have betrayed him, he still considers them as the only friends he has ever had so he starts begging his father to bring them back. </p><p>After many negations from God, Jesus escapes running in the garden in search of his nanny Mary. She is in the stable with Joseph, the gardener, where Jesus enters in tears interrupting one of the rare moments of love effusions they got the chance to exchange during working shifts. Joseph is super pissed off but Mary can not deny comfort to this little lonely child. </p><p>The scene ends with a nativity scenery showing a donkey, Joseph, Mary and Jesus crying inside the manger full of hay. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EPISODE 2 - BAPTISM </strong></p><p>Following the dramatic scenes of Jesus and his constant requests to rejoin him to his beloved humans, God sends him to be reborn on Earth where humans are already populating the planet, also sending Mary and Joseph in the shoes of his fictitious parents. Meanwhile on Earth, King Herod, embittered by his inability to generate heirs, decides to deprive anyone else of this possibility by having all the male children of the Judaea kingdom killed and also obliging the just arrived Mary and Joseph to escape in the middle of the desert, where Jesus is reborn. </p><p>Meantime, the Three Wise Men -who are wandering in the desert on their camels in search of lysergic experiences- arrive to the hut where Joseph and Mary are hiding. They are about to knock on the door when they hear someone heavily complaining about the clear worsening of his working conditions. Crouched they move closer and they find Joseph wallowing in self pity and full of rage as he does not look kindly upon the possibility of risking his own life, being forced to live in a constant escape and raising a son that is not his without even getting a salary increase from God. Opium, Mescaline, Hallucinogens are the gifts that the Three Wise Men leave to the poor Joseph moved by his desperation.That same night Joseph swallows all of the substances received by the Three Wise Men and walks into the desert vanishing without a trace. </p><p>In the next scene we see a 25-year-old Jesus. We find him at a rave party in a beach in Palestine with some of his friends: it is obvious that he has exaggerated so John the Baptist soaks him many times in sea water in order to have him recovered. Meanwhile, Jesus is screaming disconnected </p><p>sentences, self-proclaiming himself as the son of God, invoking the Holy Spirit and promising eternal life and paranormal powers to anyone who would follow him. </p><p>Many begin kneeling at his feet. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EPISODE 3 - CONFIRMATION </strong></p><p>The scene opens on God sitting in his office. He has had Peter called in order to get some explanations concerning what is happening on Earth. His right hand man reports the situation to him: Jesus keeps screwing it up and is breaking all the rules God imposed to him such as not to reveal his true identity, maintaining a low profile, and for nothing in the world mentioning the name of God. On the other hand, however, many humans begin to believe every word Jesus says and are starting to associate in order to idolize him. Caught up in vanity and pride, God decides to send Peter on Earth to better observe this new movement and to deliver an important message to his son: he must go to rehab to detoxify himself or else he will be sent right back home. </p><p>Once in the rehab center, Jesus is obliged to attend group therapy. Here is where he meets some of his future apostles and Mary Magdalene, whom he deeply falls in love with. Jesus establishes a relationship of friendship and complicity with his new fellows which is so deep and strong that they all design a plan to escape together. Once left the rehab, they go immediately back to their old habits. </p><p>As soon as the Father gets to know of Jesus’ breakout and conduct, God orders to Peter to infiltrate into his son’s group of adepts in order to study the situation from within. Therefore, Peter goes to Earth accompanied by Holy Spirit and the two of them appear at one of the party organized by Jesus. Peter knocks at the door, a disciple opens and, in the middle of a super chaotic situation the cat is passed by one apostle to the other until finally ending in Jesus’s arms. At this point Holy Spirit stares at him, heavily hisses and and meows right to his face in order to remind him who is the one and only solemn master of the Universe: his Father. </p><p>Closing on the frightened expression of Jesus who has too well understood the message that God sent him. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EPISODE 4 - EUCHARIST</strong> </p><p>The scene opens on Jesus throwing little stones on Mary Magdalene’s window to invite her to the trattoria for a supper. Unluckily, when the window opens, an enraged Pontius Pilate comes out commanding Jesus to leave his daughter in peace once and for all, and never try to approach her any more or else he will have him crucified. </p><p>Meanwhile, the apostles are impatient at the tavern waiting for Jesus to come. He arrives alone, out of breath and saddened by the discussion with Mary Magdalene's father. After a couple of hours Jesus -well drunk already- is ecstatic as, at last, he feels accepted and at home with the apostles who represent his closest friends of his everyday life and revelry. Usual situation of chaos and delirium during which Jesus is yelling random stuff around. </p><p>Suddenly a figure with covered face comes in and approaches the table, revealing Mary Magdalene that managed to escape from her father’s control. Jesus is super happy to see her until he notices something going on between her and Judas. In the grip of alcohol, he starts screaming “I’ll tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."" Apostles laugh at him. He keeps screaming “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” After all of his drunks fellas left, Jesus remains alone at the trattoria where the host tries to kick him out. Meanwhile Judah, who sneaked off with Mary Magdalene through the back door, runs into two of Pontius Pilate's guards. Mistaking Judah for Jesus, the guards want to bring him in Pontius Pilate’s presence to have him sentenced. Judas is terrorized and, in order to exculpate himself, reveals to the guards where to find Jesus. The guards enter the tavern and arrest him. </p><p>Once Jesus is in chain in front of Pontius Pilates, this latter condemns his to death as previously promised. While together, Pontius vents his hate on Jesus; in fact he can not bear that a spineless hippie like him might have so many adoring followers just by saying of being the son of a phantasmal Universe tycoon while Pontius has had to earn the esteem and respect of the citizens only after many years of service to the State. Also, he makes cruelly fun of Jesus by turning the knife in the wound and waving his daughter's perpetual infidelity. Jesus is desperate and sobs no stop: ""It's not right, I do no harm to anyone, it is not my fault!”. While moving toward his washbasin, Pontius Pilate replies: “Stop being a sissy.!I wash my hands of this and if you truly are who you brag to be, let’s see how your mighty and powerful father God will react. “ </p><p>Closing on split screens of both Pontius Pilate and God washing their hands. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EPISODE 5 - HOLY ORDERS </strong></p><p>The scene opens on Mary weeping at the foot of the cross. </p><p>Right after, we see the 12 disciples on munchies at the kebab shop. A villager comes in and tells them all about the sad facts happened to Jesus. The disciples react in a somewhat indifferent and confused way, as they are still lethargic after the previous night out at the tavern. They then make a toast to their friend, especially regretting not being able to enjoy his money and to take advantage of him anymore. </p><p>Meanwhile, God observes his son’s crucifixion thanks to Peter's live broadcast to his private TV. Peter stands a few meters from the cross and meticulously describes the situation to God, who shakes his head in disappointment for this son unable to live without looking for troubles. Furthermore, through his cheap magic tricks, he belittled his power and infamously sullied his name for which reason God decides to let Jesus stew in his own juice. </p><p>Subsequently, God instructs Peter to go to Earth and become the leader of this growing movement -called Church- in order to redeem God’s image, extend his dominion over the inhabitants of the planet and seize the umpteenth chance to piss his ex wife off infesting her new home with worshiping fanatics. Therefore, Peter gathers the 12 disciples together and proposes to them to work for God preaching his name and his law in exchange of a monthly high fixed salary. The apostles fall from the sky and totally confused ask Peter what exactly they should be preaching, since they’ve always been just partying with Jesus and they have never experienced deep conversations. Peter brainwashes them by handing them a copy of the Lord of the Rings and urging them to read it all and believe to every single word without questioning or asking questions. </p><p>[TO BILLBOARD] </p><p>THE UNQUESTIONABLE PROOF THAT J.R. TOLKIEN WAS THE ONLY ONE TO BE ABLE TO INTERPRET CORRECTLY THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BIBLE. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EPISODE 6 - ANOINTING OF THE SICK </strong></p><p>The episode begins with Jesus that, after his death and resurrection, has been taken back into his Father’s house. We see him standing by his bedroom’s window, staring off into space (the void) while listening to the song Creep by Radiohead on a loop. As the song plays he experiences flashbacks of the happiest moments spent on Earth with his 12 disciples. Suddenly, we start hearing heavy footsteps in the background. Right after, the door opens violently and God comes in roaring like a lion and cursing against his son. After yelling at Jesus, God exits the room slamming the door behind him and goes down to the kitchen in order to have breakfast. Here, he bumps into Mary Magdalene and they have a brief conversation about Jesus in which he asks for clarification about his son’s state of mind. Mary Magdalene, then, asks what exactly is the Church. God explains that it’s the tool through which he perpetually gets richer thanks to the royalties on his own name which is already become an unbeatable global brand. </p><p>While Mary Magdalene is having breakfast, God makes himself a mojito and goes out in the garden to smoke his cigar. He then calls Peter and when he arrives he asks him for an opinion about the new business of the Church. Peter presents him with a business plan, explaining all of his goals for the upcoming centuries and proposing himself as the head of the Church and God's deputy as well as his eyes on Earth. At this point God nominates him first Pope. Peter is ecstatic and before leaving, he suddenly remembers having something to show him. He pulls out a gigantic book -the Bible- from his purse and gives it to God explaining that humans have written his story completely overcoming events and adding details that have never occurred. God is shocked and asks for the book reading a few lines. They both end up laughing-out-loud. </p><p>Subsequently the scene moves in Jesus’s bedroom where is listening depressing music with Mary Magdalene who in a mocking tone asks him why with all his super powers he still needs his Father permission to go back to Earth.

At this point, touched and prideful, God looks at his employees for the very last time and says goodbye to all of them. In the meantime, Peter enters the scene running out of breath. As soon as he sees his Boss he understands the situation and starts begging him to remain, while God is opening his beach umbrella. Before taking flight God turns to Peter and, by using the most seraphic tone, he reassures him that everything will remain the same and he will not have to worry as the office and his own position have been already taken in charge by the most competent one. Peter looks at him with an astounded expression as he can not imagine anyone more competent than himself.

More specifically, the trait- d’union between the different episodes is the troubled Father - Son relationship that God and Jesus experience. These two are the main characters that will come across different events through time and space following Bible’s chronology until reaching an unexpected epilogue. This web series is a narration in which a grotesque and humorous style, sometimes extreme and brazenly, encounters a delicate pastel cinematography, curated in the slightest details, almost as if to act as a contrast and metaphor of the contradictions inherent in the story itself.Many are the events taken from the bible, but revisited in satirical terms, such as man's creation, baptism, crucifixion, and resurrection. Choosing to use actors in flesh and bones, rather than other techniques such as animation, lies in the fact that we wanted to represent what has always been painted as divine in a totally earthly way, close to us and to the idea of ordinary men. WHY WE DO IT :God Prefer Atheists is a metaphor intended to represent the abuse of power and the manipulation of the masses perpetrated over the centuries by the Church. The purpose of this project is not to offend the above-mentioned institution, but simply to bring it to a more earthy level showing how, in the end, they are just the sordidness of the single human beings to compromise and contaminate the values at the base of the institution itself and the messages that they convey. The idea that inspired us in writing this series is the common vision of how the Church has been created and how it has been managed more as a true business than as a form of faith and love. The end of the story, moreover, provides an important point of reflection regarding the approach with the superiority intrinsic in the concept of God himself to whom men must constantly look at in order to find the final Salvation. The confession of God and his consequent resignation show that in order to reach a more meaningful truth and a deeper sense of life, it is necessary to examine one’s conscience and question it with utmost honesty. The answers that every human being seeks cannot come from the outside nor from above and can not be imposed by others - as the Church suggests - but they can only be sought and found in the depths of each human soul. CHARACTERS : GOD God is the main character of the serie.The narrative timeline spans from the events starting with his divorce, passing through the creation of the humans, the beginning of the Church until finally reaching his examination of conscience that will lead to a deep repentance and his resignations.His profile corresponds to an eccentric intergalactic billionaire entrepreneur, fond lover of laziness and beer with very weak interpersonal skills. God sees himself like a self-made man; he is particularly proud of his achievements and success as well as very jealous of his own spaces, freedom and omnipotency. Not much incline to relationships compromises, he pleasantly avoids any kind of emotional responsibility that may arise.The only other living being he has a real connection with and to whom allows entering his “comfort zone” is Holy Spirit -his cat-, who’s very independent and therefore easily manageable. He is also the only creature God shows feeling some kindness towards.At the time of the story, God’s biggest issue is his only -and unwanted- son Jesus, who happens to live a very depressing life failing to keep up with his father’s big expectations. His ex wife’s Sathàna tricked him during the divorce agreement and he ends up with the sole custody of the 6 years old boy.In fact, by getting rid of his wife, God hopes to be able to resume his old habits represented by cold beers on the sofa and lazy afternoons spent with his cat, instead he finds himself with the burden of growing up a very introverted son with whom he has never really built up a relationship. Being his only heir, however, God hopes that, through his own example, the son can become like him and turn into a strong and successful man. Unfortunately, God’s expectations are denied by the facts showing Jesus as incapable of socializing and integrating, extremely sensitive, absolutely devoid of paternal countenance and of any kind of charism.During the course of the events we witness an escalation of loss of control by God caused by a growing frustration over the attitude and behaviour of his son.Finally, God decides to invest in the growing organization created by the humans and called “Church” by paying the apostles to promote his name and persuade the humans to adore him with the triple purpose of nourishing his vanity, gaining incredible amounts of money and getting revenge on his ex-wife by infesting the Earth with fanatics.HOLY SPIRIT Narrator’s voice and God’s cat, besides being his favorite creature in the whole Universe.He is the silent companion of God’s daily routine because he is the only one able to provide him with some good vibes. He shows no affection to anyone other than God and he has very little sympathy for Jesus as he empathizes with his owner’s conflict with his son. Holy Spirit also represents the heavy hand of God; in fact, whenever Jesus exceeds the limit, God sends Holy Spirit to Earth as a warning to his conduct. He will be the only one in charge of God's inheritance.JESUS Jesus is the fruit of the failed marriage between God and Sathàna.He is an introverted baby, extremely sensitive and naive. Traumatized by a cold and absent mother and a father distracted by his own omnipotence, Jesus grows up in a silent, emotionally arid and devoid of sociality environment. At an early age he discovers his passion for percussion and, with his drumsticks, spends most of his time clanking on any surface that he can find, caught in an attempt to become the greatest drummer in the whole universe and to obviate the inner and external silent that scares him. The only people who have ever proven to be affectionate to Jesus are God’s housekeeper Mary and her sweetheart, Joseph -God’s gardener- so sorry to see a child so isolated and ignored. Besides the affection of his father's employees, the only beings Jesus falls madly in love with are the humans, created by God in order to distract him from his obsession for percussions. Despite, humans will mistreat Jesus and take advantage of him, he will always keep perceiving them as his only true friends.He is the only character in the series that goes through a metamorphosis: in fact, we see him 6 years old in the first episode, adult in the second, third, fourth and sixths during his permanence on Earth where from being an introverted and lonely kid he turns into a hippie party animal with a solid social life full of friends and followers and, finally, reincarnated in Kurt Cobain in the seventh episode when, thanks to his father’s pettiness, he has to face again the impossibility of realizing his true real nature.He will commit suicide in on onrush of sadness and envy after seeing the reflection of Dave Grohl in the mirror, leaving just a letter full of grief to his father.Jesus is the true victim of the story and represents the scapegoat on which everyone projects his own faults and frustrations.SATHÀNA - GOD’S WIFE Sathàna is God’s wife. Capricious, spoiled and annoying, she represents what the Church has always identified in the Devil. She is a petty woman who has taken advantage of him trying to make the most out of their divorce. After a troubled matrimony, the woman’s only desire is to start over a new life and get rid of her so hard to handle and complex son Jesus. Through a trick she manages to ensure Jesus under God’s sole custody and obtain the property of the whole planet Earth, her favorite holiday resort. God has always hated the Earth as it was the place where he was obliged to spend all his holidays. However, well aware of the affective value that the planet represents for his wife, it turns into a good starting point for revenge and that’s the reason why he will infest it with humans.ADAM & EVE Adam & Eve are the first humans created by God in the desperate attempt to distract and entertain his son Jesus.Being created in God’s image and likeness -drunk in addiction- they embody all his worsts sides. Therefore, Adam and Eve are two stubborn insolents with no respect at all who do not recognize anyone's authority including God himself, thereby triggering his anger.They spend their time sunbathing, drinking cocktails, and lazing around without denying to subjugate Jesus to any of their requests and to use him to provoke God's wrath and continually challenge his omnipotence, as in the apple episode.As a result of their disobedience they will be exiled to Earth.JOSEPH & MARY Joseph & Mary appear in the first episode respectively as the gardener of God’s home with the passion for fishing and Jesus’s nanny and God's housekeeper.They both present a docile, obedient and obliging character.They feel such an extreme pity and affection for Jesus as a child that they will be the chosen ones to go with him to Earth as his fictitious parents.Joseph will go through difficult times when he will finally realize to be obliged to grow up the son of someone else and, after meeting with the Three Wise Men on the night of Jesus' birth and having received a good amount of hallucinogenic substances, he will get lost in the desert leaving Mary by herself with the child.Henceforth we will no longer see Mary expect for a few frames at the time of Jesus’s crucifixion when she cries her son by the foot of the cross.PETER Peter is the alter ego of Jesus and is the devout servant of God.An all-round obedient and ambitious but with zero personality and subjugated by power.God is proud of his adoration and for this he entrusts him with His personal and important tasks, certain of his total fidelity. Peter heavily envy Jesus because he would like it to be him the designated heir instead of a useless child unable to bring forth the possibilities being offered. Following all the troubles caused by Jesus on Earth, Peter is sent there as an infiltrator among the 12 disciples in order to reaffirm God's authority.In order to be more in control of the situation he then becomes Jesus' confidant and gains his trust. In fact, as soon as Jesus dies, Pietro inherits the role of leader of the 12 apostles. Peter will then become the first Pope of the Church and vice God that will continue serving him faithfully until the day of his resignation.MARY MAGDALENE Mary Magdalene is the daughter of the High State Official Pontius Pilate and one and only love of Jesus. She is an absent-minded girl who essentially wants to have fun and aims at who offers her more.Despite her father cannot stand all the boys buzzing around her, especially that longhair hippie of Jesus, Mary Magdalene keeps taking advantage of him, and, after the resurrection, she convinces him to take her to God’s place. Once living at the Mansion, when Jesus shows the first signs of post-Earth depression, she is be the first trying to dissuade him from the idea of returning there but with no success. Finally, having obtained immortality by God, she quits Jesus at the very last minute as she prefers going hitchhiking throughout the Universe.JUDAS Judas is one of Jesus disciples and his fellow drinking buddy. We meet him for the first time during a rave in Palestine and then we see him again during the last supper when we find out he is secretly having an affair with Mary Magdalene. After leaving Jesus completely wasted at the tavern, he bumps into two of Pontius Pilate's guards while he’s going back home with Mary Madgalene. The guards mistaken him for Jesus and want to bring him in to Pilate in order to have him executed. Terrorized, Judas, in order to save himself, reveals to the guards where to find Jesus of Nazareth.SUPPORTING CHARACTERS KING HEROD A ruthless king who cannot have heirs. He commands the murder of all male babies of his kingdom, in the grip of one of his tyrannical sprints.THREE WISE MEN Three hipsters freaks in search of lysergic experiences in the desert.While in hallucinogenic delirium they find Giuseppe, who smokes and moans outside the stable where Jesus was born. They are really moved by the state of the poor man and will share with him part of their drug stockpile.JOHN THE BAPTIST John the Baptist is a regular raver. He appears in the 2nd episode during a party in Palestine where he meets Jesus in delirious conditions. Moved by compassion, he tries to help him recover by repeatedly soaking him in sea water.12 DISCIPLES (future Catholic Church preachers) Considered by Jesus as his family, the 12 are lost souls without a home or a job, who find in Jesus a sustenance because of his wealth and the miracles he performs. After Jesus death by crucifixion, they find themselves with no money therefore are easily bought by Peter and God and will agree to promote the doctrine of the Catholic Church in exchange for a high monthly salary and material goods (wealth).PONTIUS PILATE Pontius Pilate is a High State Official, n love with his uniform and the power that it gives him. Extremely jealous of his daughter, he hates all the guys around her, especially the hippie hiccups like Jesus. He loves to establish his authority and therefore punishes Jesus to death, who has repeatedly challenged him by falling in love with her daughter. THE STORY EPISODE 1 - MATRIMONY The episode opens on God’s office where, in the presence of his wife, he is signing the divorce papers. The scene is seen from the perspective of the Holy Spirit -God’s cat- who enters the room and walks towards God’s feet where it starts rubbing on. Once convinced to be finally free from his annoying ex wife, God realizes that he had not paid enough attention to the terms of the divorce clauses and, not only his wife has obtained the total property of the planet Earth, but he is also finding himself stuck with the sole custody of his son Jesus obsessed by one and only dream: becoming a drummer. Without any desire to be a Father, God finds himself drunk during his first face to face dinner with his son. God is puzzled by the child’s behavior and does not understand why he is so introverted, and asocial and he feels already exasperated by Jesus’ obsession for percussions. In the grip of desperation and extreme drunkenness, he tries a way out to distract Jesus from drums by creating some creatures with some random materials found in the kitchen.The very next day he releases humans in his garden -also called Eden- which is full of beautiful fruit trees and has a huge swimming pool in it. Once in the garden, God warns the humans about the terrible punishments they will face should they eat from the Apple Tree of the Knowledge of the Good and the Evil - which is his sole solemn property- and introduces them to his son. Jesus is ecstatic and begins showing clear signs of improvement by socializing and playing with Adam & Eve. Actually, the latter are two extremely hedonistic people with no respect at all for authority and in practice they just use Jesus to mock him or force him in doing all the forbidden and funny things. Pretty soon, through a trick, Eve convinces Jesus to take an apple from his father's forbidden tree. Right after, Peter runs to God in order to report the fact. God goes mad and immediately convenes his son together with Adam and Eve in his office. Once in the presence of God, the two humans blame Jesus without even giving him the possibility to speak or defend himself. Suspicious about Adam and Eve’s behavior, God asks for the consultation of a special witness: the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Following the revelations made by the Tree, he establishes to exile humans on Earth with the dual purpose of punishing them and bothering the ex-wife. Jesus is super saddened by humans departure. In fact, even though they have betrayed him, he still considers them as the only friends he has ever had so he starts begging his father to bring them back. After many negations from God, Jesus escapes running in the garden in search of his nanny Mary. She is in the stable with Joseph, the gardener, where Jesus enters in tears interrupting one of the rare moments of love effusions they got the chance to exchange during working shifts. Joseph is super pissed off but Mary can not deny comfort to this little lonely child. The scene ends with a nativity scenery showing a donkey, Joseph, Mary and Jesus crying inside the manger full of hay. EPISODE 2 - BAPTISM Following the dramatic scenes of Jesus and his constant requests to rejoin him to his beloved humans, God sends him to be reborn on Earth where humans are already populating the planet, also sending Mary and Joseph in the shoes of his fictitious parents. Meanwhile on Earth, King Herod, embittered by his inability to generate heirs, decides to deprive anyone else of this possibility by having all the male children of the Judaea kingdom killed and also obliging the just arrived Mary and Joseph to escape in the middle of the desert, where Jesus is reborn. Meantime, the Three Wise Men -who are wandering in the desert on their camels in search of lysergic experiences- arrive to the hut where Joseph and Mary are hiding. They are about to knock on the door when they hear someone heavily complaining about the clear worsening of his working conditions. Crouched they move closer and they find Joseph wallowing in self pity and full of rage as he does not look kindly upon the possibility of risking his own life, being forced to live in a constant escape and raising a son that is not his without even getting a salary increase from God. Opium, Mescaline, Hallucinogens are the gifts that the Three Wise Men leave to the poor Joseph moved by his desperation.That same night Joseph swallows all of the substances received by the Three Wise Men and walks into the desert vanishing without a trace. In the next scene we see a 25-year-old Jesus. We find him at a rave party in a beach in Palestine with some of his friends: it is obvious that he has exaggerated so John the Baptist soaks him many times in sea water in order to have him recovered. Meanwhile, Jesus is screaming disconnected sentences, self-proclaiming himself as the son of God, invoking the Holy Spirit and promising eternal life and paranormal powers to anyone who would follow him. Many begin kneeling at his feet. EPISODE 3 - CONFIRMATION The scene opens on God sitting in his office. He has had Peter called in order to get some explanations concerning what is happening on Earth. His right hand man reports the situation to him: Jesus keeps screwing it up and is breaking all the rules God imposed to him such as not to reveal his true identity, maintaining a low profile, and for nothing in the world mentioning the name of God. On the other hand, however, many humans begin to believe every word Jesus says and are starting to associate in order to idolize him. Caught up in vanity and pride, God decides to send Peter on Earth to better observe this new movement and to deliver an important message to his son: he must go to rehab to detoxify himself or else he will be sent right back home. Once in the rehab center, Jesus is obliged to attend group therapy. Here is where he meets some of his future apostles and Mary Magdalene, whom he deeply falls in love with. Jesus establishes a relationship of friendship and complicity with his new fellows which is so deep and strong that they all design a plan to escape together. Once left the rehab, they go immediately back to their old habits. As soon as the Father gets to know of Jesus’ breakout and conduct, God orders to Peter to infiltrate into his son’s group of adepts in order to study the situation from within. Therefore, Peter goes to Earth accompanied by Holy Spirit and the two of them appear at one of the party organized by Jesus. Peter knocks at the door, a disciple opens and, in the middle of a super chaotic situation the cat is passed by one apostle to the other until finally ending in Jesus’s arms. At this point Holy Spirit stares at him, heavily hisses and and meows right to his face in order to remind him who is the one and only solemn master of the Universe: his Father. Closing on the frightened expression of Jesus who has too well understood the message that God sent him. EPISODE 4 - EUCHARIST The scene opens on Jesus throwing little stones on Mary Magdalene’s window to invite her to the trattoria for a supper. Unluckily, when the window opens, an enraged Pontius Pilate comes out commanding Jesus to leave his daughter in peace once and for all, and never try to approach her any more or else he will have him crucified. Meanwhile, the apostles are impatient at the tavern waiting for Jesus to come. He arrives alone, out of breath and saddened by the discussion with Mary Magdalene's father. After a couple of hours Jesus -well drunk already- is ecstatic as, at last, he feels accepted and at home with the apostles who represent his closest friends of his everyday life and revelry. Usual situation of chaos and delirium during which Jesus is yelling random stuff around. Suddenly a figure with covered face comes in and approaches the table, revealing Mary Magdalene that managed to escape from her father’s control. Jesus is super happy to see her until he notices something going on between her and Judas. In the grip of alcohol, he starts screaming “I’ll tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."" Apostles laugh at him. He keeps screaming “Truly I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.” After all of his drunks fellas left, Jesus remains alone at the trattoria where the host tries to kick him out. Meanwhile Judah, who sneaked off with Mary Magdalene through the back door, runs into two of Pontius Pilate's guards. Mistaking Judah for Jesus, the guards want to bring him in Pontius Pilate’s presence to have him sentenced. Judas is terrorized and, in order to exculpate himself, reveals to the guards where to find Jesus. The guards enter the tavern and arrest him. Once Jesus is in chain in front of Pontius Pilates, this latter condemns his to death as previously promised. While together, Pontius vents his hate on Jesus; in fact he can not bear that a spineless hippie like him might have so many adoring followers just by saying of being the son of a phantasmal Universe tycoon while Pontius has had to earn the esteem and respect of the citizens only after many years of service to the State. Also, he makes cruelly fun of Jesus by turning the knife in the wound and waving his daughter's perpetual infidelity. Jesus is desperate and sobs no stop: ""It's not right, I do no harm to anyone, it is not my fault!”. While moving toward his washbasin, Pontius Pilate replies: “Stop being a sissy.!I wash my hands of this and if you truly are who you brag to be, let’s see how your mighty and powerful father God will react. “ Closing on split screens of both Pontius Pilate and God washing their hands. EPISODE 5 - HOLY ORDERS The scene opens on Mary weeping at the foot of the cross. Right after, we see the 12 disciples on munchies at the kebab shop. A villager comes in and tells them all about the sad facts happened to Jesus. The disciples react in a somewhat indifferent and confused way, as they are still lethargic after the previous night out at the tavern. They then make a toast to their friend, especially regretting not being able to enjoy his money and to take advantage of him anymore. Meanwhile, God observes his son’s crucifixion thanks to Peter's live broadcast to his private TV. Peter stands a few meters from the cross and meticulously describes the situation to God, who shakes his head in disappointment for this son unable to live without looking for troubles. Furthermore, through his cheap magic tricks, he belittled his power and infamously sullied his name for which reason God decides to let Jesus stew in his own juice. Subsequently, God instructs Peter to go to Earth and become the leader of this growing movement -called Church- in order to redeem God’s image, extend his dominion over the inhabitants of the planet and seize the umpteenth chance to piss his ex wife off infesting her new home with worshiping fanatics. Therefore, Peter gathers the 12 disciples together and proposes to them to work for God preaching his name and his law in exchange of a monthly high fixed salary. The apostles fall from the sky and totally confused ask Peter what exactly they should be preaching, since they’ve always been just partying with Jesus and they have never experienced deep conversations. Peter brainwashes them by handing them a copy of the Lord of the Rings and urging them to read it all and believe to every single word without questioning or asking questions. [TO BILLBOARD] THE UNQUESTIONABLE PROOF THAT J.R. TOLKIEN WAS THE ONLY ONE TO BE ABLE TO INTERPRET CORRECTLY THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE BIBLE. EPISODE 6 - ANOINTING OF THE SICK The episode begins with Jesus that, after his death and resurrection, has been taken back into his Father’s house. We see him standing by his bedroom’s window, staring off into space (the void) while listening to the song Creep by Radiohead on a loop. As the song plays he experiences flashbacks of the happiest moments spent on Earth with his 12 disciples. Suddenly, we start hearing heavy footsteps in the background. Right after, the door opens violently and God comes in roaring like a lion and cursing against his son. After yelling at Jesus, God exits the room slamming the door behind him and goes down to the kitchen in order to have breakfast. Here, he bumps into Mary Magdalene and they have a brief conversation about Jesus in which he asks for clarification about his son’s state of mind. Mary Magdalene, then, asks what exactly is the Church. God explains that it’s the tool through which he perpetually gets richer thanks to the royalties on his own name which is already become an unbeatable global brand. While Mary Magdalene is having breakfast, God makes himself a mojito and goes out in the garden to smoke his cigar. He then calls Peter and when he arrives he asks him for an opinion about the new business of the Church. Peter presents him with a business plan, explaining all of his goals for the upcoming centuries and proposing himself as the head of the Church and God's deputy as well as his eyes on Earth. At this point God nominates him first Pope. Peter is ecstatic and before leaving, he suddenly remembers having something to show him. He pulls out a gigantic book -the Bible- from his purse and gives it to God explaining that humans have written his story completely overcoming events and adding details that have never occurred. God is shocked and asks for the book reading a few lines. They both end up laughing-out-loud. Subsequently the scene moves in Jesus’s bedroom where is listening depressing music with Mary Magdalene who in a mocking tone asks him why with all his super powers he still needs his Father permission to go back to Earth. Jesus sorrowfully answers he can only appear in the form of a ghost into someone’s dream but he’s not able to go physically back on the Planet. In the next scene we are back on Earth where Judah, in his bedroom, is having a nightmare. He suddenly wakes up and finds Jesus barefoot by the window wearing a white tunic and staring off into space as usual. A brief confrontation between the two follows and this is the only time when Jesus, destroyed and in rage because of the double betray of his friend, shows a bit of character. Judas however, realizes pretty soon it’s only a ghost when Jesus fails to punch him in the face passing him through. Judas bursts into a loud laughter and Jesus is once again defeated. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene snitches on Jesus with God about the getaways of Jesus to Earth and his random apparitions to the disciples. God cannot take it anymore and decides to send Holy Spirit to Earth to pick his son up. So the cat goes to Earth and finds Jesus in a state of deep shock outside the window of some of his former disciples now turned into brainwashed smoke preachers. In the final scene we are back to God’s Mansion while the Father is scolding Jesus and imposes him an ultimatum commanding him to be careful this time as there won’t be a second resurrection. Right after, Peter comes in and passes a note to Jesus. He opens it and finds a message from Mary Magdalene who explains that she is breaking up with him because she had obtained immortality from God and she wants to go traveling throughout the whole Universe. Before leaving his father, Jesus asks where he would end up in case he should die. God looked at him vaguely with a resigned expression and walks away. We close on Jesus back on Earth this time reincarnated in Kurt Cobain. EPISODE 7 - PENANCE & RECONCILIATION [CONFESSION] The scene opens on Earth in Kurt Cobain’s bathroom where Jesus/Kurt is all curled up writing a letter in order to give vent to his depression. A few extracts of the letter are shown. As soon as he has finished writing, Jesus gets up and slowly approaches the sink in order to brush his teeth. He finds drumsticks in the glass together with the toothbrush. Then, while brushing his teeth, he looks into the mirror and sees Dave Grohl's reflection brushing his teeth with a drumstick and looking at him with a grungy grin. This represents for Jesus the straw that breaks the camel’s back of his dissatisfaction and unhappiness. After having spent his childhood begging his father to get him the drums in order to become the greatest drummer in the universe -his recurring dream- and after having convinced him to send him back to his beloved Earth, he finds himself tricked again by his father that had him reincarnated in one of the greatest singers of his century. Once his brain pictures the image of Dave Grohl in the mirror -Nirvana’s drummer and future frontman of the Foo Fighters- Jesus will see a flashback running through a lifetime of failure. Tired of having to fight constantly, he closes his eyes... SUICIDE - black screen, background sound of gunshot. In the next scene we are back to God’s Mansion. God is in his room, in front of the mirror, in a state of complete shock: he has Jesus/Kurt’s suicide letter in one of his hand and he is aware of having to deal with a hard mea culpa.Long monologue of God who finally realizes how all the bad things happened until that moment have been caused by his intolerant and boastful attitude and defects. While God is experiencing a severe examination of his conscience, flashbacks of all the suffering he caused are shown. Subsequently, the scene moves to God Mansion’s Garden. It’s a splendid sunny day, all the characters are there, standing still while God passes through the garden with a six pack of beer in his left hand and a wicker bag from which a huge beach umbrella and some philosophy books appear. At this point, touched and prideful, God looks at his employees for the very last time and says goodbye to all of them. In the meantime, Peter enters the scene running out of breath. As soon as he sees his Boss he understands the situation and starts begging him to remain, while God is opening his beach umbrella. Before taking flight God turns to Peter and, by using the most seraphic tone, he reassures him that everything will remain the same and he will not have to worry as the office and his own position have been already taken in charge by the most competent one. Peter looks at him with an astounded expression as he can not imagine anyone more competent than himself. God begins his Mary Poppins style ascent by using the beach umbrella and throws a last glance at Peter yelling: “PETER... GET A DAMN LIFE!” Peter starts running towards God’s office: once arrived, he opens the door straight and finds Holy Spirit on his owner’s desk with a couple of cats guarding the room. The scene closes on a big close up of Holy Spirit that meows while yawning. THE END  APPENDIX SOMETIME LATER The scene opens on God pouring some beers behind the counter of a beach hut.On the other side of the counter two young atheists are seated. They criticize the Catholic Church and question the existence of God. Then, they turn to him in order to ask if their opinions are disappointing him.Solemnly God looks at them in silence, then he raises his beer mug to the sky and proclaims seraphic: -“Who me? I prefer atheists!”-Everyone bursts out laughing loud while rising up and toasting the glasses.Closing on God that - with a voice broken from laughing - says : -“Next round is on me!”-  WHAT YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING FOR :This campaign is aimed to raise 15,000 $ in order to fund the production of the pilot episode for our web serie God Prefers Atheists.All the actors except the main character (God) will star friends of us and people from our circle of connections.

She’s a beautiful, busty, skilled fighter who barely wears anything and calls it “armor”. Most of the Magic in this world consists of spells that are cast by people like Donny. However, there are a few special people in the world who have elements within themselves. While their powers are strong than standard magic users, they are unable to cast their abilities the way a mage would. However, a special metal was discovered that draws out these people’s inner abilities. Since its discovery, specialized blacksmiths have forged weapons for these people out of the metal that allow them to effectively control and wield their powers.Hitomi is one of these special people, however she is even more rare as she contains two elements inside of her. Both fire and ice. The dual blades she wields are identical, but depending on which side of her body she holds the metal determines which element it draws out.Hitomi is the former queen and ruler of this fantasy world. She can be full of herself and cocky, but for good reason. Because of her elemental abilities, she is one of the strongest warriors in this world. Every year she hosts a tournament attempting to find someone who can best her in battle. What began with gold for a prize was increased year after year. No matter how great of a prize she offered, nobody was able to defeat her. Finally, she offered up the ultimate prize, her kingdom. During this tournament a mysterious man challenged Hitomi. His name is Lord Maltac...Not much is known about this mysterious person. The aura that surrounds him has the ability to form a defensive barrier. It can also be solidified and propelled from his body and used offensively to attack or snare his targets. Finally, Maltac has the ability to disintegrate anything his hands touch, making him a fierce and deadly foe. To everyone’s surprise, Hitomi is no match for Lord Maltac, and he easily defeats her. In one last desperate attack, Hitomi lunges at Maltac with one of her blades. He grabs a hold of it and it dissolves into dust. At the moment, Hitomi falls to her knees and admits defeat. She is cast out of her own kingdom and wanders the world. Composer Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez has created a wonderful soundtrack for the series. A few of the pieces, including the main theme, can be heard bellow.

 

 
 
The amount we're asking for is to allow us to finish animating this trailer. As mentioned in the video, due to struggles with the COVID-19 crisis, we have been unable to finish animating this trailer. This trailer will allow us to pitch to various networks like Netflix, Hulu, etc.     The world is in chaos right now, we understand it is difficult for people to financially support something like this. We are simply at a point where we need assistance in order to finish this trailer. There's also no guarantee that even with this trailer complete, that we'll be picked up by a network. Since this is an animated show that's not an adult comedy or aimed at children, many U.S. studios won't consider it a lucrative investment. However, we believe that people are ready for more dramatic action animation that isn't just for children. If you aren't in a position where you can donate, please share the campaign around on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets! The more we can spread the news of Lost Kings, the more likely we'll make our funding.",17.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Gist</h3>
<p>When Warlock Oliver Blackburn's soul is stolen from his body and placed in the body of a dark warlock named Alastair Mulcahy, he turns to Celestine, Alastair's betrayed magical partner, and a group of her fellow witches in order to track down Alastair and return each warlock to his respective body so Alastair can pay for his crimes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's what we need to make this happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>A budget of $12,000 that would finance the locations, props, costumes, cast, crew, and equipment we need to make this a truly spectacular show. We are big believers in supporting local talent and creatives and this budget would serve to make sure we're able to pay people what they deserve for working hard to create an incredibly unique and original new pilot. </li>
<li>So what do you get, aside from the satisfaction of knowing you helped budding creatives make their dreams come true? Well, a lot of cool stuff actually. </li>
<li>Perks include access to a directors log podcast, posters, signed scripts, opportunity to be an extra, and a whole lot of other super exciting stuff!</li>
<li>We're making this pilot one way or another. If we don't reach our goal the project will still be produced and you'll have an incredibly funny and cool TV pilot to enjoy. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>To be real, making TV is very expensive. By donating to our campaign you're not only ensuring that we make the highest quality pilot but also that the hard work of the cast and crew does not go unappreciated. We want to be sure to bay pay everyone what they deserve to support and give back to local talent. Your contribution allows this to be possible. </p>

What We Need & What You Get
So here's what we need to make this happen:

A budget of $12,000 that would finance the locations, props, costumes, cast, crew, and equipment we need to make this a truly spectacular show. We are big believers in supporting local talent and creatives and this budget would serve to make sure we're able to pay people what they deserve for working hard to create an incredibly unique and original new pilot. 
So what do you get, aside from the satisfaction of knowing you helped budding creatives make their dreams come true? Well, a lot of cool stuff actually. 
Perks include access to a directors log podcast, posters, signed scripts, opportunity to be an extra, and a whole lot of other super exciting stuff!
We're making this pilot one way or another. If we don't reach our goal the project will still be produced and you'll have an incredibly funny and cool TV pilot to enjoy. 


Your Impact
To be real, making TV is very expensive. By donating to our campaign you're not only ensuring that we make the highest quality pilot but also that the hard work of the cast and crew does not go unappreciated. We want to be sure to bay pay everyone what they deserve to support and give back to local talent. Your contribution allows this to be possible.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

He resists his own personal legend until circumstances force him to change. In his quest to end the evils of the world, he discovers an unexpected foe. <br/><br/>We have provided a Prelude (above) to give the look and feel of the art, the characters, and the storytelling style. </p>

<h3>Where's the money going?! </h3>

<li>%40 of your contribution will be divided among the artists to encourage them to continue their hardwork and dedication. Monetary motivation will go a long way to demonstrating your appreciation for their work and galvanizing their morale toward further production! </li>

<li>%5 of your contribution will go to the underground musicians who so graciously rendered their work with the expectation of nothing but ""exposure""! </li>
<li>The remainder will go to business expenses: upgrading equipment and software, taxes, and of course PERK FULFILLMENT! </li>

<h3>WHY DID WE CREATE THRONE PREDICTIONS?</h3>
<p>Like many others around the world we are very excited for the 8th and final season of Game of Thrones. Many conversations around the world regarding Game of Thrones are about what will happen in the final season.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who will survive?</li>
<li>Who will take the iron throne?</li>
<li>Will Jamie kill Cersei, like he killed the Mad King?</li>
<li>Will the Hound kill his brother, the Mountain?</li>
<li>......and many others</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of keeping all the theories locked in our conversations we created an online website where anyone can submit their predictions completely FREE, <a href=""https://thronepredictions.com%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://thronepredictions.com </a></p>
<h3>HOW TO PLAY?</h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to <a href=""https://thronepredictions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://thronepredictions.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Click on the button called ""Predictions"" or scroll down until you get to the ""Predictions"" section</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552510696/e12mnefva7uduhkrf8l5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in all your predictions</li>
<li>Enter your email &amp; Password (So you can log in to see how you are doing and that we can contact you with important information)</li>
<li>Click the ""Submit"" button</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE PREDICTIONS</h3>
<p><strong>The Main Part</strong></p>
<p>The main predictions focus on predicting who will survive through the final season. You go through a list of 29 characters as seen below and simply click ""Alive"" or ""Dead"" to mark that person living or dead at the end of the season. This section is capped off with the prediction regarding who will win the<strong> Iron Throne!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552510857/fjqpvc9qrfgibr2avqve.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Bonus Part</strong></p>
<p>The bonus section brings in some extra theories which you can label ""True"" or ""False"" pointing to whether they will or will not happen.</p>
<p>For more descriptive rules regarding the predictions please read them at <a href=""https://thronepredictions.com/legal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://thronepredictions.com/legal</a></p>
<p> It is possible to change any of your predictions by contacting us on our website.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHEN THE SHOW STARTS?</h3>
<p>When the show starts on the 14th of April, you don't need to do anything but check back after each episode. The website will automatically update your status and the number of your points. You will be able to see how you match up against the entire world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>COMPETING WITH FRIENDS</h3>
<p>After the predictions are submitted you can log in and see your answers in a dashboard. The dashboard also shows the average answers of all the users participating and will allow you to see the predictions of your friends.</p>
<p>You will also be able to see just how many people already filled in their predictions and exactly how many people <strong>(IF ANY)</strong> made the exact same predictions as you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552510987/w7iu9cargpvaulyosnnt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When logged in and on the dashboard page every user will also be allowed to create a private group and invite his/her friends. Inside the group, the users will be able to see each other's predictions. </p>
<p>As of the time when this campaign is being launched this feature (private groups) is not yet available but is planned to be implemented before April. So fill your prediction now and later we will remind you to simply connect to your friends. This feature is only one of the examples where your funds will help us with the development.</p>
<h3>HOW WILL YOUR FUNDS HELP US?</h3>
<p>Building the website, hosting the website, marketing the website and during the season maintaining the website has and will take quite some money, time and effort. In order to keep our services free for everyone to use we are launching this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>Please support us so we can all have a great final season of one of the best TV shows of all time. #GOAT </p>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p>Specifically for this Indiegogo campaign, we have created several pledge rewards which you can get for yourself by backing this project.</p>
<p><strong>All the details</strong> of the perk rewards will be communicated after the project ends. Details like: shirt sizes, which predictions are yours, ...</p>
<p>Our perk rewards are based on the predictions that you have made. The items will serve as your <strong>MEMORY TO THE MOST AMAZING SHOW: GAME OF THRONES</strong>. 10 years in the future you will be able to show your shirt or mug with your predictions because Game of Thrones is going to be immortal.</p>

</div></div>","WHY DID WE CREATE THRONE PREDICTIONS?
Like many others around the world we are very excited for the 8th and final season of Game of Thrones. Many conversations around the world regarding Game of Thrones are about what will happen in the final season.

Who will survive?
Who will take the iron throne?
Will Jamie kill Cersei, like he killed the Mad King?
Will the Hound kill his brother, the Mountain?
......and many others

Instead of keeping all the theories locked in our conversations we created an online website where anyone can submit their predictions completely FREE, https://thronepredictions.com 
HOW TO PLAY?


Simply go to https://thronepredictions.com/

Click on the button called ""Predictions"" or scroll down until you get to the ""Predictions"" section



Fill in all your predictions
Enter your email & Password (So you can log in to see how you are doing and that we can contact you with important information)
Click the ""Submit"" button


THE PREDICTIONS
The Main Part
The main predictions focus on predicting who will survive through the final season. You go through a list of 29 characters as seen below and simply click ""Alive"" or ""Dead"" to mark that person living or dead at the end of the season. This section is capped off with the prediction regarding who will win the Iron Throne!

 
The Bonus Part
The bonus section brings in some extra theories which you can label ""True"" or ""False"" pointing to whether they will or will not happen.
For more descriptive rules regarding the predictions please read them at https://thronepredictions.com/legal
 It is possible to change any of your predictions by contacting us on our website.

WHEN THE SHOW STARTS?
When the show starts on the 14th of April, you don't need to do anything but check back after each episode. The website will automatically update your status and the number of your points. You will be able to see how you match up against the entire world.

COMPETING WITH FRIENDS
After the predictions are submitted you can log in and see your answers in a dashboard. The dashboard also shows the average answers of all the users participating and will allow you to see the predictions of your friends.
You will also be able to see just how many people already filled in their predictions and exactly how many people (IF ANY) made the exact same predictions as you. 

When logged in and on the dashboard page every user will also be allowed to create a private group and invite his/her friends. Inside the group, the users will be able to see each other's predictions. 
As of the time when this campaign is being launched this feature (private groups) is not yet available but is planned to be implemented before April. So fill your prediction now and later we will remind you to simply connect to your friends. This feature is only one of the examples where your funds will help us with the development.
HOW WILL YOUR FUNDS HELP US?
Building the website, hosting the website, marketing the website and during the season maintaining the website has and will take quite some money, time and effort. In order to keep our services free for everyone to use we are launching this Indiegogo campaign.
Please support us so we can all have a great final season of one of the best TV shows of all time. #GOAT 
PERKS
Specifically for this Indiegogo campaign, we have created several pledge rewards which you can get for yourself by backing this project.
All the details of the perk rewards will be communicated after the project ends. Details like: shirt sizes, which predictions are yours, ...
Our perk rewards are based on the predictions that you have made. The items will serve as your MEMORY TO THE MOST AMAZING SHOW: GAME OF THRONES. 10 years in the future you will be able to show your shirt or mug with your predictions because Game of Thrones is going to be immortal.
Below you can see some rough examples of the perk rewards. The rewards will not look exactly like the images below but they are enough to provide basic ideas.

<p><strong>A letter from our Co-founders, Robyn and Melissa: </strong></p>
<p>Hi, we are Robyn and Melissa, Co-founders of Welcome Home Yoga &amp; Wellness (WHY). We are newly married, but met 6 years ago, when the seed for WHY was first planted. With our respective backgrounds in yoga (Robyn) and massage (Melissa), and our independent experiences with healing, it wasn’t long before we began to dream of opening a yoga studio and wellness center together in Detroit. We found the perfect spot in the historical B. Siegel Building, in the Bagley District, at 7 Mile Rd. and Livernois Ave. and set our sights on manifesting our shared vision of bringing an inclusive, health and wellness space to the community.</p>
<p>When the pandemic struck, we continued to nurture this dream, offering classes, online &amp; outdoors. We worked hard over this past fall and winter to secure funding for building out a new space. Moving forward with plans for expansion has been a brave, but really intentional decision. The need for yoga to be visible, accessible and become an essential part of the cultural landscape here is strong. We are so excited to be a part of the revitalization happening along the Avenue of Fashion. The journey to get here has been a dream come true.</p>
<p>As we emerge from what has been a challenging year and transition into our new home, we are so close to reaching our funding goal and need your support. Since planning and budgeting our buildout, the cost of materials have skyrocketed due to the pandemic. So, we are launching this campaign and are asking for your help to get us across finish line. When we open our doors this fall, we will be a community space, yoga school, and wellness center, where all may come freely just as you are and explore your feelings through breath and movement. <i>Welcome Home, Everyone!</i></p>

<h2>Research into Mold Contamination in Homes </h2>
<p>Studies have shown that up to 25% of the population might develop a hypersensitive to mold. However many don't realize anyone can have adverse reactions to buildings with high levels of mold contamination. Research has shown that water damaged buildings often cause major impacts to health and well being. What isn't always so clear -- is how to return a contaminated building to a normal safe, healthful and nurturing environment. Currently the conventional wisdom is that hard surfaced items with settled spores or fungal fragments can easily be cleaned. But many questions remain. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489415590/gng1jzfy0qsmfmbmdyqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<h3>Author &amp; Researcher - John C. Banta</h3>
<p>Certified Industrial Hygienist and Author John Banta has worked professionally for the last 30 years investigating indoor environmental quality problems in homes and work environments. His first book <i>Prescriptions for a Healthy House: A Practical Guide for Architects, Builders and Homeowners</i> was co-authored with Architect Paula Baker-LaPorte and MD Erica Elliott and is now in its third edition. John is currently working on a new book --<i>Mold Controlled: A Practical Guide to Find, Avoid, and Fix Mold Problems in Water Damaged Homes. <i> </i></i>The book is aimed at demystifying mold problems and how to return mold contaminated housing to the nurturing healthful environments we should have as home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489415619/ugxdfvpsjaexkckv9n4r.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<h3>The Research</h3>
<p>The funds raised by this campaign will support science based research to answer a number of important remaining issues: </p>
<ul>
<li>Can soft furnishings be effectively cleaned to remove mold spores, fungal fragments, and mycotoxins (toxins produced by mold)?</li>
<li>Which cleaning methods are effective, and which are not?</li>
<li>When should a contaminated mattress, sofa or other upholstered furnishing be discarded?</li>
<li>Are barrier covers such as those for dust mites effective in preventing re-contamination? </li>
<li>Can barrier covers be used to provide protection when used on an already contaminated mattress?</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2012 the Journal of Asthma, 49:139–143 Published a study: ""Daily Vacuuming of Mattresses Significantly Reduces House Dust Mite Allergens, Bacterial Endotoxin, and Fungal β-Glucan."" This study concluded ""Daily vacuuming of mattresses significantly decreased levels of house dust mite allergens, endotoxin, and Fungal β-glucan. This method offers sensitized patients a cheaper option to reduce their exposure to bio-contaminants in their bed.""</p>
<p>There are a number of questions that were not answered by the study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fungal β-glucan is found in the cell wall of molds. It is not specific to molds associated with water damage. Your contribution to this crowd-funding venture would be used to test for water damage associated molds using mold specific DNA (MSQPCR).</li>
<li>The study tested mattresses were HEPA vacuumed daily at a rate of one minute per square meter for eight weeks. At the end of the eight weeks the daily vacuuming had reduced the levels of dust mites, endotoxins and fungal glucans by approximately 85%. The study supported by your contribution would help answer the mold question using MSQPCR.</li>
<li>After the daily vacuuming was stopped the mattresses continued being monitored. Six weeks later the levels of allergenic dusts had returned to the pre-study levels.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The MSQPCR panel used is known as ERMI. It measures the quantities of DNA identified for thirty-six specific genotypes of molds. Laboratory charges for the ERMI panel is $300 per sample. Predominant molds can be analysed as a panel for $150 for a panel of any five of the identified molds. </p>
<p><strong>Study One (We met our funding goal for Phase 1 of this study. The results have been posted on the secure Contributor Login section of my website)</strong></p>
<p>The first study replicated the eight week mattress study using MSQPCR to identify the molds found in dust that can be vacuumed from the surface. The dust will be collected before cleaning begins and at two week intervals for the eight weeks of the study. The pre-study sample and the sample collected at the eighth week were analysed using the full ERMI panel. Samples collected at week 2, 4 and 6 were analysed for the most predominant water damage related species identified at the beginning of the study. After the eight weeks of vacuuming the mattress had core samples collected at depths of two, four, six, and eight inches for analysis of the predominant water damage related species deep in the cleaned mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Study Two (Part one of the barrier cloth study has been funded and completed and posted in the Contributor Login section of my website, additional funds are needed for phase 2 which will repeat the study with barrier cloths that have been laundered)</strong></p>
<p>This second study was able to capitalize on the first study since the mold contamination types and quantities were already determined by the pre-study MSQPCR sample. The effectiveness of multiple types of barrier cloths was be tested by placing the barrier on the contaminated mattress and determining the types and quantities of molds that were able to be vacuumed through the barrier cloth. The dust that was vacuumed through the barrier was be analysed using the same MSQPCR analysis used by the pre-study samples. The results showed that Dust Mite Barriers also help reduce mold contamination - but one type was superior to all the rest!</p>
<p><strong>Study Three (If this campaign is over-funded)</strong></p>
<p>The third study would be performed based on available funds and the identification of potential mycotoxin producing organisms in the mattresses. This third study will be able to capitalize on the first study since the mold contamination types and quantities will have already been determined by the pre-study MSQPCR sample. In those cases where one or more organisms that are capable of producing a target mycotoxins is present the actual level of mycotoxins present in the mattress would then be determined prior to and after an interval of HEPA vacuuming. Each mycotoxin test is $300 per sample. In addition to determining if mycotoxins could be removed from a mattress, layer testing would be used to determine the penetration of mycotoxins within the mattress. This study is currently on hold - until we find a mattress contaminated with mycotoxins that can be used.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Previous studies have left many unanswered questions about whether cleaning porous contents such upholstered furnishings and mattresses can be effective. Some methods are likely to work better than others and some measures may only be temporary. It is important for mold sensitive persons to know what methods of cleaning are effective and what methods are not. This will help people determine reasonable expectations for what can be achieved. In a number of cases people have discarded and replaced contaminated items, only to have the contamination reappear in brand new furnishings. Knowing which temporary measures are effective, such as barrier cloths will also help establish a temporary safe environment while decisions are made regarding remediation or relocation.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Submission for Publication in a Peer Reviewed Journal</strong></p>
<p>Most peer reviewed publications do not permit prior publication. As a contributor, you will be a part of the inner circle, so we will be able to keep you informed with progress updates as the studies move forward, but the formal publication of the book <i>Mold Controlled</i> will need to be delayed until after the research studies have been completed, peer reviewed and appeared in the selected journal(s). Journals typically do not want researchers to submit their findings to more than one publication at a time. Additional delays can occur whenever a journal rejects a submission and during the editing and peer review process. Further delays may occur when peer reviewers request additional information, reject content or request that submissions be rewritten. It is estimated this process could require two years before the published studies can be referenced in the book. As a contributor you will be provided an access code that you can use to review the draft chapters, and illustrations of the book as they are posted. Combined with routine research updates - this will help insure you have access to the most up-to-date mold remediation information available. You will continue to have on-line access to the book in draft form until your copy of the e-book is published and emailed to you. </p>

Studies have shown that up to 25% of the population might develop a hypersensitive to mold. However many don't realize anyone can have adverse reactions to buildings with high levels of mold contamination. Research has shown that water damaged buildings often cause major impacts to health and well being. What isn't always so clear -- is how to return a contaminated building to a normal safe, healthful and nurturing environment. Currently the conventional wisdom is that hard surfaced items with settled spores or fungal fragments can easily be cleaned. But many questions remain. 
 

Author & Researcher - John C. Banta
Certified Industrial Hygienist and Author John Banta has worked professionally for the last 30 years investigating indoor environmental quality problems in homes and work environments. His first book Prescriptions for a Healthy House: A Practical Guide for Architects, Builders and Homeowners was co-authored with Architect Paula Baker-LaPorte and MD Erica Elliott and is now in its third edition. John is currently working on a new book --Mold Controlled: A Practical Guide to Find, Avoid, and Fix Mold Problems in Water Damaged Homes.  The book is aimed at demystifying mold problems and how to return mold contaminated housing to the nurturing healthful environments we should have as home.

The Research
The funds raised by this campaign will support science based research to answer a number of important remaining issues: 

Can soft furnishings be effectively cleaned to remove mold spores, fungal fragments, and mycotoxins (toxins produced by mold)?
Which cleaning methods are effective, and which are not?
When should a contaminated mattress, sofa or other upholstered furnishing be discarded?
Are barrier covers such as those for dust mites effective in preventing re-contamination? 
Can barrier covers be used to provide protection when used on an already contaminated mattress?

In 2012 the Journal of Asthma, 49:139–143 Published a study: ""Daily Vacuuming of Mattresses Significantly Reduces House Dust Mite Allergens, Bacterial Endotoxin, and Fungal β-Glucan."" This study concluded ""Daily vacuuming of mattresses significantly decreased levels of house dust mite allergens, endotoxin, and Fungal β-glucan. This method offers sensitized patients a cheaper option to reduce their exposure to bio-contaminants in their bed.""
There are a number of questions that were not answered by the study:

Fungal β-glucan is found in the cell wall of molds. It is not specific to molds associated with water damage. Your contribution to this crowd-funding venture would be used to test for water damage associated molds using mold specific DNA (MSQPCR).
The study tested mattresses were HEPA vacuumed daily at a rate of one minute per square meter for eight weeks. At the end of the eight weeks the daily vacuuming had reduced the levels of dust mites, endotoxins and fungal glucans by approximately 85%. The study supported by your contribution would help answer the mold question using MSQPCR.
After the daily vacuuming was stopped the mattresses continued being monitored. Six weeks later the levels of allergenic dusts had returned to the pre-study levels. The contributions from this crowd-funding venture would be used to attempt to determine if levels climbed because high levels of the contaminated dust remained in the home and re-infested the mattress or if contaminants were buried deep in the mattress and re-worked their way to the surface.

It is estimated $1,650 of funds raised by this campaign would pay for laboratory analysis for one round of testing on one mattress.

Use of Extra Funds if the Project is Over-Funded
If this project is over-funded the extra contributions from this crowd-funding venture would be used for replicate studies, additional research and book production costs as follows:

The original study did not address mycotoxins. Is HEPA vacuuming effective in removing mycotoxins from contaminated fabrics, mattresses and upholstered furnishings?
If HEPA vacuuming is not effective for mattresses and upholstered furnishings, are there other effective methods that can be used?
If preliminary studies show that mold contaminated porous furnishings can be successfully restored, the studies will need to be replicated enough times to be sure that the results are real and not a fluke!
It is easy to decide what to do with gypsum walls that have visible growth, but how much extra material should be removed and discarded beyond the visible growth to be sure that actual growth has been eliminated?
Production costs for the book could include professional editing, illustrations, salaries, layout and design.

Many take whatever job they land after graduating, and often waste years (or decades) of their work-life stuck in unfulfilling jobs.</p><p>Career Clarifier is unlike any other career test. Here’s why: All the popular career tests today suggest careers primarily based on personality. The flaw with that methodology is that personality determines <u>HOW</u> we do our job but not <u>WHAT</u> job we should do.</p><p>Think for a moment about the sharks on the hit tv show Shark Tank. They all have the same job - business leader and investor- but their personalities are <u>wildly</u> different.</p><p>Instead of personality, it’s their ability to size up an entrepreneur, analyze a market, understand the financials of a business, and structure a profitable deal.  It’s their skills, knowledge and abilities that make them great at their careers.</p><p>Career Clarifier, unlike other career tests, primarily uses a person’s skills, knowledge, and interests (and a bit of personality) to identify career options that truly fit.</p><p>Our career clarity test is the perfect solution for:</p><ul>
<li>Students in university / college getting ready for the working world</li>

We need your backing to provide career clarity tests for veterans, people of color, 1st generation college students - or students at your alma mater - to help them achieve the professional success and financial self-sufficiency they want and deserve.In exchange, we’ll give you a free career clarity test that you can use yourself or gift to a friend or loved one. (And who doesn’t know someone who is unsatisfied with their current career.)  WHAT PROBLEM DOES CAREER CLARIFIER SOLVE?Despite spending tens of thousands of dollars (or more) on their college education, more than half of college graduates don’t know what career they would enjoy and excel in. Many take whatever job they land after graduating, and often waste years (or decades) of their work-life stuck in unfulfilling jobs.Career Clarifier is unlike any other career test. Here’s why: All the popular career tests today suggest careers primarily based on personality. The flaw with that methodology is that personality determines HOW we do our job but not WHAT job we should do.Think for a moment about the sharks on the hit tv show Shark Tank. They all have the same job - business leader and investor- but their personalities are wildly different.Instead of personality, it’s their ability to size up an entrepreneur, analyze a market, understand the financials of a business, and structure a profitable deal.  It’s their skills, knowledge and abilities that make them great at their careers.Career Clarifier, unlike other career tests, primarily uses a person’s skills, knowledge, and interests (and a bit of personality) to identify career options that truly fit.Our career clarity test is the perfect solution for:
Students in university / college getting ready for the working world
A recent college grad still looking for a job / career
A not-so-recent college grad feeling stuck in their career 
Experienced working professionals looking to make a career transition 
High school students thinking about what they want to major in during college
  THIS CAMPAIGN ADDRESSES A CRITICAL SOCIAL PROBLEMThere’s a big gap between the knowledge of careers known by nearly all college students and college graduates and the 1,000+ different careers that exist.While veterans, people of color, and 1st generation college students have big dreams and strong motivation, they typically have less knowledge of the professional careers available to them to help them achieve their full potential. Many will get stuck in unsatisfying jobs that don’t let them achieve their potential.That’s why for each career test we sell at Career Clarifier, we will donate a career test to a veteran who is enrolled in college, a student at an HCBU, or a 1st generation college student.When you back this campaign, you’ll be helping people you know personally who need career support, and we will be able to provide the Career Clarifier to three traditionally underserved populations so they can have inspiring careers and be heroes to people in their communities.Because of your support, they will be the example that other people will look to and think, “I can do that with my career too.”   CAREER CLARIFIER IS EASY TO USEPeople can use their computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone to answer 80 multiple choice questions about skills, knowledge, and interests.Our proprietary platform will compare their answers to an in-depth analysis of more than 1,000 jobs and careers geared toward people with college degrees.

Like a baby, it requires around-the-clock attention. If you neglect to give this attention at the right times and in the right doses, you will pay the consequences. </p><p>From the doctor, I was given a checklist of taking insulin, checking blood sugar, and exercising, but no one told me about the mood swings, anxiety, and loneliness that come with managing Type 1. Family and friends are there for us, but at the end of the day find it hard to relate. Needless to say, I battled on my own for some time.</p><p>I learned that on average, a Type 1 Diabetic makes 180 treatment-related decisions in a day on top of all the other daily activities. Living with diabetes can be exhausting, both mentally and physically from the rollercoaster of blood sugar.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Journey Towards Inner Freedom</h2>
<p>In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to lose sight of what really matters: a healthy, happy, and meaningful life. We invite you to join our first course series on Personal Mastery where we will deeply explore transformative lifestyle techniques such as gratitude and mindfulness practices, emotional intelligence, healing, values, vision and purpose.</p>
<p>This course is for you if you face these common challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling stagnant</li>
<li>Overwhelmed</li>
<li>Angry or fearful</li>
<li>Lonely or isolated</li>
<li>Hopeless or powerless</li>
<li>Pessimistic or dissatisfied.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The Personal Mastery course is a 6-month immersive experience to help you regain your strength, optimism, and confidence to live fully with purpose and meaning. In this journey we deeply explore transformative techniques, tools, and practices to help you live your absolute best version.</p>
<p>In our experience, most other development courses are compartmentalized with very limited focus. And in the world of 24/7 on-demand virtual programming, personal connection is lost. </p>
<p>Unlike typical programs, our personal mastery series offers the deep connection of a cohort structure in a blended learning format. Virtual course modules include live sessions, mid-month check-ins, and breakout group discussions. Asynchronous coursework contains science-based interactive exercises, expert interviews, and current research. This course is appropriate for all levels of self-development.</p>
<p><strong>Join us as we explore our inner workings, realign with values, and rediscover a purpose-driven life</strong>.   </p>

In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to lose sight of what really matters: a healthy, happy, and meaningful life. We invite you to join our first course series on Personal Mastery where we will deeply explore transformative lifestyle techniques such as gratitude and mindfulness practices, emotional intelligence, healing, values, vision and purpose.
This course is for you if you face these common challenges:

Feeling stagnant
Overwhelmed
Angry or fearful
Lonely or isolated
Hopeless or powerless
Pessimistic or dissatisfied.

 
The Personal Mastery course is a 6-month immersive experience to help you regain your strength, optimism, and confidence to live fully with purpose and meaning. In this journey we deeply explore transformative techniques, tools, and practices to help you live your absolute best version.
In our experience, most other development courses are compartmentalized with very limited focus. And in the world of 24/7 on-demand virtual programming, personal connection is lost. 
Unlike typical programs, our personal mastery series offers the deep connection of a cohort structure in a blended learning format. Virtual course modules include live sessions, mid-month check-ins, and breakout group discussions. Asynchronous coursework contains science-based interactive exercises, expert interviews, and current research. This course is appropriate for all levels of self-development.
Join us as we explore our inner workings, realign with values, and rediscover a purpose-driven life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Beverly, a professional woman who practices and teaches yoga.  I started practicing yoga 10 years ago and wasn't long before I enrolled in a program to certify to teach yoga. Shortly afterwards, I opened a yoga studio.  A safe &amp; welcoming space for everyone.  My goal is to inspire and help people form their own unique yoga practice.  It makes sense to me, since each body is like a piece of art, there are no two exactly the same.   When I started to practice I realized how powerful yoga can be when it helped me manage symptoms from anxiety and panic episodes.  When I started teaching and observing others experience their own transformation, it reaffirmed yoga's ability to help heal and revitalize energy in the body. </p>
<p>The thought of losing this space where people come together without judgement makes me sad.  I feel like a whole community will be let down leaving a void where this type of yoga studio is needed.  The trendy yoga can be intimidating, this is a place where one can be comfortable and begin the journey to repair, restore and balance.  Get centered here!  the information age wreaks havoc on our bodies due to the majority of the day being immobile, sitting in an office, and massive amounts of information overtaxing our minds.   Yoga has changed my life and many people in our community.  I'd like to continue to maintain and expand this studio as it  brings forth community spirit, inspiration, light, growth, knowledge, and  inner-peace.  A place to explore the different styles of yoga to find the one that fits your body type.  We share the roots of yoga philosophy and science only if one has the desire to learn it.  Our place is neutral where one can reclaim their own minds and reconnect to their bodies &amp; beliefs. </p>
<p>I would be overjoyed to be able to maintain and expand this community.  With your help, we can continue to operate and expand within the community.  You will help serve traditional yoga to a large community of people who ordinarily are intimidated to enter a formal yoga studio.   No gym yoga offered , it's traditional Hatha, Flow classes, Restorative &amp; Yin. Iyengar Yoga is the core of inspiration to learn how to properly align our bodies while practicing.   We specialize in small class learning for individualized attention.  Safe, &amp; welcoming to all body types, cultures and backgrounds. </p>

<li>The studio's current need is $6,000  </li>
<li>Our uniqueness is keeping the yoga practice real no discrimination to anyone who comes to us to learn, practice or meditate. </li>
<li>The funds will go to renewing our lease next month. </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Last month when we were looking at the yoga studio business end to end, it came to me that there is more here than our livelihood. Its the people who made this a warm and welcoming community for yoga.  The people are wonderful and count on this space.  i overheard a woman talking saying ""she didn't know what she would do for yoga if this place wasn't here"".  It made me realize, most people want to try yoga, practice yoga or learn about yoga and they need to be comfortable.  So this studio has drawn people out of their home practice to a studio practice that feels like home. </p>

<li>my gifts are blended with strong intuition and education in business management. </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Heidi Sormaz – I’ve been teaching at and running Fresh Yoga in New Haven for 15 years. I’m so grateful to have seen the upsurge of interest in yoga and its growth throughout this city.  Although more yoga is available, what I primarily see across the country is exclusivity.  I’m committed to refreshing Fresh Yoga to make it more accessible and more inclusive. Instead of providing the occasional free class for students who cannot afford typical studio prices – I’m committed to a system where people can pay on a sliding scale according to their ability and maintain a regular yoga practice within a community. Yoga is and always has been about seva - being of service and giving to others in order to truly be happy in life.</p>
<p>To make this vision a reality, Fresh Yoga is changing the structure of the studio to a donation-based organization. It will include a sliding scale cost structure, $5 community classes, no-minimum donation classes on Saturdays (Seva Saturdays), and need-based tuition scholarships for the majority of our yoga programs. Part of the change is a simplification - going back to our home base at Erector Sq and closing the downtown location. Erector Sq is where we began in the heart of East Rock. I lived in this neighborhood for many years so the area will always feel special to me. As a graduate student in New Haven for five years, I know the challenging reality of attempting to live a balanced life as a full time student.</p>
<p>Through 15 years, 2 build outs, and 4 different physical locations, Fresh has never raised our prices. As we face our largest transformation, Fresh Yoga is striving to maintain a sustainable model of business not only for our community but also for our teachers and staff – we hope to remain a vibrant part of the community for another 15 years!</p>
<p>We hope you will be inspired to help us transform Fresh Yoga – your donation will allow us to completely refresh - to know that when we begin this transition at the beginning of January we will be able to stay afloat providing lower cost options for classes, workshops and trainings that everyone can take advantage of.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal at Fresh Yoga is to create a community in which everyone contributes according to their ability and the resources available to them. In order to do this in a way that ensures we meet our operating costs, we are creating a tiered system of rates and asking community members to participate at the level that works for them and their budget.</p>
<p>Specifically, there will be 3 main payment tiers:</p>
<p>The Base Rate is our first tier – it covers 65% of what is needed to run the studio. It provides an affordable option for regular study.</p>
<p>The Sustaining Rate is our second tier. It reflects the current market value for yoga classes and helps us by meeting the actual operating costs of the studio, which includes being able to pay the teachers who are teaching free, $5 donation and no-minimum donation classes for their expertise, time, and energy.</p>
<p>The Benefactor Rate is our third tier. It is 20% higher than the sustaining rate. If an individual can afford this level, they are assisting our efforts to offer tiered, scholarship, and need-based classes.</p>
<p>If someone cannot afford the base level – they can apply for a larger scholarship based on need.</p>
<p>The donations made during this campaign will help sustain Fresh during the transition to the new system. We are looking to raise enough funds to cover the sustainability of the studio for the next 6 months. Your donation will go toward balancing the operating costs of the studio while providing lower cost options. Specifically :</p>
<p>- 50% of teachers pay</p>
<p>- 50% of the rent and utilities</p>
<p>- 50% of administration </p>
<p>After the campaign, we will continue to host an online store with Fresh Merchandise and hold special events to help sustain us in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh Perks</strong></p>
<p>In the spirit of generosity and inclusivity, we extend the following perks to you in deep appreciation for any amount you're able to give. There is super Fresh swag: tanks and our coveted light-weight hoodie, yoga classes and private sessions including online, at Fresh, prenatal, postnatal, and mommy and baby; wellness options such as meditation and massage, music, and yoga training for you or someone you would like to sponsor. Look over the options and choose what's right for you. </p>
<p>Any contribution makes you a benefactor - you will benefit all who want to come to the studio. You are helping us make this transition a successful one.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/f6Zm8yIYWg8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although there is a risk in this transformation, that is being able to meet our goal of sustaining the studio while providing low cost options - there is very little risk in this campaign. All funds raised, whether or not we are able to meet our goal will go toward the support of being able to provide as many low cost services as we can. The major challenge you are helping us with is the ability to maintain the operating costs through the transition. The more we raise - the better chance we have of survival!</p>
<p>Although we predict that there will be enthusiasm for this new approach, Fresh can't predict exact numbers. The upside is that we already have a strong base at Erector Sq, as we have been there for 15 years and I believe that base will sustain. In closing the downtown studio, we are eliminating overhead but also anticipate some loss of clients due to the closure. We are running the campaign to carry us through the transition so that we can use this time to gather data and rebudget while still being able to pay the teachers and staff.</p>
<p>I believe we will be able to solve any challenge that arises because we have a 15 year track record of success. During that entire time, we have continuously been able to give 2% of our profit to local New Haven charities, keep our doors open, and pay our teachers and staff for their time and expertise.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I’m Heidi Sormaz – I’ve been teaching at and running Fresh Yoga in New Haven for 15 years. I’m so grateful to have seen the upsurge of interest in yoga and its growth throughout this city.  Although more yoga is available, what I primarily see across the country is exclusivity.  I’m committed to refreshing Fresh Yoga to make it more accessible and more inclusive. Instead of providing the occasional free class for students who cannot afford typical studio prices – I’m committed to a system where people can pay on a sliding scale according to their ability and maintain a regular yoga practice within a community. Yoga is and always has been about seva - being of service and giving to others in order to truly be happy in life.
To make this vision a reality, Fresh Yoga is changing the structure of the studio to a donation-based organization. It will include a sliding scale cost structure, $5 community classes, no-minimum donation classes on Saturdays (Seva Saturdays), and need-based tuition scholarships for the majority of our yoga programs. Part of the change is a simplification - going back to our home base at Erector Sq and closing the downtown location. Erector Sq is where we began in the heart of East Rock. I lived in this neighborhood for many years so the area will always feel special to me. As a graduate student in New Haven for five years, I know the challenging reality of attempting to live a balanced life as a full time student.
Through 15 years, 2 build outs, and 4 different physical locations, Fresh has never raised our prices. As we face our largest transformation, Fresh Yoga is striving to maintain a sustainable model of business not only for our community but also for our teachers and staff – we hope to remain a vibrant part of the community for another 15 years!
We hope you will be inspired to help us transform Fresh Yoga – your donation will allow us to completely refresh - to know that when we begin this transition at the beginning of January we will be able to stay afloat providing lower cost options for classes, workshops and trainings that everyone can take advantage of.

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal at Fresh Yoga is to create a community in which everyone contributes according to their ability and the resources available to them. In order to do this in a way that ensures we meet our operating costs, we are creating a tiered system of rates and asking community members to participate at the level that works for them and their budget.
Specifically, there will be 3 main payment tiers:
The Base Rate is our first tier – it covers 65% of what is needed to run the studio. It provides an affordable option for regular study.
The Sustaining Rate is our second tier. It reflects the current market value for yoga classes and helps us by meeting the actual operating costs of the studio, which includes being able to pay the teachers who are teaching free, $5 donation and no-minimum donation classes for their expertise, time, and energy.
The Benefactor Rate is our third tier. It is 20% higher than the sustaining rate. If an individual can afford this level, they are assisting our efforts to offer tiered, scholarship, and need-based classes.
If someone cannot afford the base level – they can apply for a larger scholarship based on need.
The donations made during this campaign will help sustain Fresh during the transition to the new system. We are looking to raise enough funds to cover the sustainability of the studio for the next 6 months. Your donation will go toward balancing the operating costs of the studio while providing lower cost options. Specifically :
- 50% of teachers pay
- 50% of the rent and utilities
- 50% of administration 
After the campaign, we will continue to host an online store with Fresh Merchandise and hold special events to help sustain us in the long run.
Fresh Perks
In the spirit of generosity and inclusivity, we extend the following perks to you in deep appreciation for any amount you're able to give. There is super Fresh swag: tanks and our coveted light-weight hoodie, yoga classes and private sessions including online, at Fresh, prenatal, postnatal, and mommy and baby; wellness options such as meditation and massage, music, and yoga training for you or someone you would like to sponsor. Look over the options and choose what's right for you. 
Any contribution makes you a benefactor - you will benefit all who want to come to the studio. You are helping us make this transition a successful one.

 

Risks & Challenges
Although there is a risk in this transformation, that is being able to meet our goal of sustaining the studio while providing low cost options - there is very little risk in this campaign. All funds raised, whether or not we are able to meet our goal will go toward the support of being able to provide as many low cost services as we can. The major challenge you are helping us with is the ability to maintain the operating costs through the transition. The more we raise - the better chance we have of survival!
Although we predict that there will be enthusiasm for this new approach, Fresh can't predict exact numbers. The upside is that we already have a strong base at Erector Sq, as we have been there for 15 years and I believe that base will sustain. In closing the downtown studio, we are eliminating overhead but also anticipate some loss of clients due to the closure. We are running the campaign to carry us through the transition so that we can use this time to gather data and rebudget while still being able to pay the teachers and staff.
I believe we will be able to solve any challenge that arises because we have a 15 year track record of success. During that entire time, we have continuously been able to give 2% of our profit to local New Haven charities, keep our doors open, and pay our teachers and staff for their time and expertise.

<p>When I say Re-Introduce Hypnotherapy to my business, I really do mean re-introduce, in that this has been a skill of mine since grade school and have used in the past to help people with past life work, memory and soul retrieval, and other services that hypnosis has been found to be a powerful tool for.  As my business moves further away from being a road show psychic medium and healer and more into a Holistic Health Care and Life Coach Service Provider, I am working to add some amazing capstone services and certifications to build my marketability. With the help of an amazing business coach, some business school training and a lot of trial and error I have brought my business to a point where it’s sustaining itself and by getting this state certification done, I will be opening a massive revenue door and going from surviving mode to thriving mode! The best part of this, I already have clients excited to sign up from having worked with me through other services!</p>
<p>My Journey with Blue Moon weaver, my business, began about 4-5 years ago under a completely different business name and a blog but as I began to grow and embrace my skills, things changes.  So over the past 3 +/- years I have been growing Blue Moon Weaver by reading tarot cards and doing work for paranormal groups as a psychic medium. Shortly after I started adding in my Jin Shin Jyutsu Services (Think Acupuncture + Reiki = Awesome) and that made money too and helped me expand upon the depth and meaning of my readings for my clients.  Once i was sure that this combo was working well for clients, I started promoting myself as a Psychic and Holistic healer. Then somewhere along the line I started getting noticed as a medium in the paranormal field and was invited to be a regular a radio show out of Canada and was with them for about a year. While doing the show, I added to my toolbox of services by getting my full certification in Jin Shin Jyutsu and my level two mastery in Reiki. I also began working at a metaphysical shop and traveling to popular paranormal events to build my reputation and clientele. Finally I started adding on herbalism (herbal medicine) and massage therapy and now I am reclaiming my Hypnotherapy skills with the goal of being able to offer a fully rounded Holistic health Care and Life Coach service so I can help my clients move onto their healthiest and most prosperous life path.</p>
<p>So Here is the Business Plan:</p>
<p>I am currently working as Psychic Medium and I am Being Picked Up by a Sponsored (AKA: Paid) Podcast in January 2018 and will continue my work with the paranormal and promoting myself there.</p>
<p>I am also working with a business coach to help make sure I stay focused and make the best use of my time, energy, skills, and resources.</p>
<p>I am currently working on an associates level herbalism certification and am set to do massage therapy licensing at the end of 2018  (*These two items plus the Hypnotherapy are my capstones and add credibility with the state and insurance companies)</p>
<p>By the End of 2018 Blue Moon Weaver will be licensed as an LLC</p>
<p>By 2019 I will be in a store front brick and mortar, offering Apothecary and Metaphysical products in the front of house and aiding clients in the back offices. I already have individuals I am training up to help in this as employees as I wish to remain a sole proprietor.</p>
<p>I do have some bigger plans after this, but right now a great opportunity has been offered for me to get this certification for the state at a reasonable cost and I want to get you what you need to know now so that you can help me really make my business bang over the next year and make it possible for me to actually start thriving and showing my daughter, women can make it in a field they love no matter the obstacles. And it’s with your help I’m going to be able to do all of this.</p>
<p>So here’s what you can do to help!</p>
<p>DONATE! Every dollar helps! And with that said, more is better in this case, but again, if 2500 people each donate $1, its still all good, but please do help and for helping I have some fun things to say thank you including neat little letters from spirit, readings, and Priority List Privileges for those who would like to try my Hypnotherapy Services out!</p>
<p>Share this With Everyone You Know! Tell Them “Hey, look at this lady trying to make a better life for herself and her family and her community by building her business and herself up! It’s Amazing! Help Her! Please!”</p>
<p>Finally! Give yourself a hug from me for helping out in any way you possibly could, it is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Lots of love to you all and Thank you again!</p>

I am currently working on an associates level herbalism certification and am set to do massage therapy licensing at the end of 2018  (*These two items plus the Hypnotherapy are my capstones and add credibility with the state and insurance companies)
By the End of 2018 Blue Moon Weaver will be licensed as an LLC
By 2019 I will be in a store front brick and mortar, offering Apothecary and Metaphysical products in the front of house and aiding clients in the back offices. I already have individuals I am training up to help in this as employees as I wish to remain a sole proprietor.
I do have some bigger plans after this, but right now a great opportunity has been offered for me to get this certification for the state at a reasonable cost and I want to get you what you need to know now so that you can help me really make my business bang over the next year and make it possible for me to actually start thriving and showing my daughter, women can make it in a field they love no matter the obstacles. And it’s with your help I’m going to be able to do all of this.
So here’s what you can do to help!
DONATE! Every dollar helps! And with that said, more is better in this case, but again, if 2500 people each donate $1, its still all good, but please do help and for helping I have some fun things to say thank you including neat little letters from spirit, readings, and Priority List Privileges for those who would like to try my Hypnotherapy Services out!
Share this With Everyone You Know! Tell Them “Hey, look at this lady trying to make a better life for herself and her family and her community by building her business and herself up! It’s Amazing! Help Her! Please!”
Finally! Give yourself a hug from me for helping out in any way you possibly could, it is greatly appreciated!
Lots of love to you all and Thank you again!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Our purpose to aid others in their spiritual progression through the services and products we offer, and now we have the opportunity to expand and open our wellness center.The 3 Corners Wellness Center will include all the products and services we already offer, as well as the addition of classes, art therapy, Reiki sessions, and more. We are looking to raise 25k or more for our building fund within 45 days. The money raised will go toward the purchase of the building where the wellness center will reside. It will also help us provide the necessary stock and any upgrades we may need to get started. Our wellness center will reside in the Decatur, GA, area. The 3 Corners Wellness Center will be open to the public, all ages and spiritual walks of life. We promote wellness and mental well being that supports the mind, body, and soul. We believe that our spiritual or energetic body needs just as much care and support as our physical bodies do. Our approach works with the Mind, Body, and Soul.We offer tools and classes that promote clarity of mind (thoughts) through the use of aromatherapy, chakra balancing, color therapy, and products that relax and enhance mental energy.
We promote healthy eating and exercise in a few ways, such as through Reiki sessions, yoga classes, dance therapy, and advice and products. These different services will promote physical health and well being.
Our atmosphere itself is soothing and relaxing to the soul. We maintain an environment that is clean, uplifting, and free. We do this through the music selection we play, incense we burn or diffuse (aromatherapy) and through our decor. We also offer advice through various forms of divination, such as through chakra analogy or art therapy.Your contribution will increase an appreciation to us in any amount, and we thank all of those who contribute. Please feel free to view the video and photos we provide to follow our progress. We will keep our content and visuals up to date as we progress. We have an excellent support group through our Little 5 Points family so far, and we look forward to having you as well.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>At Bond Together we are dedicated to providing families and schools with tools to mitigate the risk of mental illness and obesity in their children. Our interactive platform has a library of videos that teach joyful movement, exercise, and mental wellness skills. </p>
<p><i>A full year's subscription will be donated to a low income family for every subscription purchased through this Indiegogo campaign.</i></p>
<p>With your help, we can create 80 new videos that target children of different age groups. Why so many videos? Because science has shown that only consistent engagement with healthy thought patterns and behaviors will have a lasting impact. More videos means more opportunities to develop those thought patterns and behaviors. </p>
<p><i>Together we can help children develop into healthy and happy adults.  </i></p>
<p><strong>Why Bond Matters</strong></p>
<p>From ages 10-35 years old, suicide is the second leading cause of death. Obesity affects nearly 20% of children from ages 2-18. If your child is going to have a serious health issue, it will likely involve one or both of these maladies. While they might not seem related, science has shown that there is a strong connection between physical health and mental wellness, and what’s more, they are best addressed together.</p>
<p>Our name, BOND (<strong>BO</strong>dy and Mi<b>ND</b>) gestures towards the combination of physical health and mental health. Just as your physical health begins with healthy habits from a young age, your mental health also starts early and must be maintained throughout life. At Bond Together we provide families and schools with the necessary tools to develop lifelong physical and mental health.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, many schools and parents only focus on the academic success of their children. This implicitly suggests that academic achievement is more important than personal wellbeing. Luckily, this is beginning to change. And that’s where Bond Together comes in. Bond Together empowers schools and parents to teach kids habits that will help them thrive physically and mentally—and healthy kids perform better in and out of school. </p>

<p><strong>HOW TO HELP YOUR KIDS</strong></p>
<p><strong>School Subscription:</strong></p>
<p>Many schools do not have the resources to provide their students with tools for mental wellness and physical education. You can have a meaningful impact on hundreds of children by purchasing a subscription for the whole school. Every child and every teacher will be able to use the videos free of charge every single day.</p>
<p><strong>Home Subscription:</strong></p>
<p>At home, children will move through over 100 videos, gaining badges as they learn and practice life enhancing skills. They will exercise with cardio, strength and stretch videos; learn full dance routines; and practice breathing, mindfulness, and happiness skills. With your help we will be adding additional videos monthly. </p>
<p>If we are fully funded, we will be able to create a library of 80 new videos that will cover the multi-video curriculum of 15 new mental health skills, 12 new dance routines and 12 new cardio, strength and stretch combinations. </p>

<p><strong>What can we do with $35,000?</strong></p>
<p>Creating one 10 minute video costs roughly $450. Those fees include paying for the actors, film crew and production. With your help we will be able to design and develop 80 new videos, making it possible to teach 4 additional months of curriculum.</p>

<p>One in five people will suffer from a mental illness, and those numbers will continue to climb without swift and effective action. Fifty percent of mental illness starts by age fourteen. Historically, our society has only addressed mental health after the onset of mental illness. Science has shown that this is a chronically ineffective approach. We are dramatically more successful at proactively preventing mental illness than we are at reactively treating it. That’s why we have developed a meaningful curriculum that teaches evidence-based skills to children at a young age, and young is important because that’s when children's brains are still very malleable. We teach healthy habits for young brains and bodies through interactive videos accessed daily in the classroom or at home. Kids have a blast while deepening their reservoir of skills for a healthy and happy life. </p>

<p>Bond Together teaches children evidence-based skills to deal with challenging emotions and face difficult situations. These include positive psychology, growth mindset, mindfulness, emotion awareness, emotion regulation and reframing thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Dance:</strong></p>
<p>Bond Together promotes fun and joyful movement to help strengthen children's cardiovascular systems, muscles, coordination and flexibility while gaining neurological benefits such as a decrease in cortisol (a stress hormone) and an increase in memory and focus.</p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Every start-up faces great risks. If Amazon, for example, decided to create a program like ours, it would be a challenge to compete. As a small company our resources are limited so we always run the risk of being muscled out by a big company.</p>
<p>Technology is always changing. By having a product that is based online there is always risk that new technologies will be incompatible with our videos. </p>
<p>Additionally, if a policy was created that required all schools to implement a mental health curriculum that was created by the state, we would have to pivot and find a way to support their efforts. </p>
<p>As we have all experienced over the past few months, life can be unpredictable. Throughout history, unpredictability has lead to a decrease in consumer spending. Therefore, it may be harder to sell our product to families who are facing job loss, turbulent home conditions, and the complications of remote learning/working. </p>

<h3>From Dream to Reality</h3>
<p>Since even before the inception of Navina, we (Drew &amp; Daniela) have dreamt of having a place to cultivate and nurture an international community of like-minded people. The Osa region of Costa Rica is this place for us. We are so deeply drawn to the jungles here - the rainforest nourishes us on a level that no other place in the world has (that we've been to). </p>
<p>With your support, Navina Costa Rica will be a space for enriching nature-based experiences, world-class training intensives, transformational retreats and individualized getaways that will leave you irrevocably changed. Bringing people together from all over the globe, our eco centre will be a hub of connection for health professionals, wellness seekers, and international movers-and-shakers.</p>
<p>There really aren't any words that adequately express the degree of healing that happens in this kind of environment. We've been running training intensives in the region for 2 years now and have seen it first-hand. There's just something about the jungle that changes you - making you not only more peaceful and less stressed, but also more resilient, more powerful and restored to a ""full cup"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks in Detail - The Energy Exchange</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $60,000USD in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalize the purchase of the land (we're halfway there!) and get construction rolling! </li>
<li>Equip the centre with an eco-conscious energy solution. We're planning on Tesla battery packs for storing solar energy.</li>
<li>Planting trees that will nourish people staying at the centre for decades to come!</li>
<li>Train local Costa Ricans in Thai Yoga Massage - providing a powerful skill that can create employment opportunities for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've created a tiered system of contribution, with some selections for those who intend on coming to the Centre, and options for any of you who want to help but are unsure of whether you'll make it to visit us in Costa Rica:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$50 </strong>- <i>""<u>Navina Jungle Kitchen""</u></i> - our online cookbook, updated annually with new recipes.</li>
<li>
<strong>$100</strong> - <u><i>Big Trees!</i></u> - Sponsor a tree that will feed us for many years to come. We are planting avocado, mango, breadfruit, jackfruit and cacao trees around the Centre. (It'd be pretty cool to sponsor a chocolate tree, right!?).</li>
<li>
<strong>$300</strong> - <i><u>Online Course Bundle!</u> - </i>Our Specialized online courses ""Introduction to Thai Yoga Stretching for Exercise Professionals"" and ""Savasanahhh"" - our blend of restorative yoga and Thai Massage. Ongoing access and updates!</li>
<li>
<strong>$700</strong> - <u><i>One Week Stay</i> </u>- valid for a single 7-night stay at the Centre! To be used within 5 years of our opening. (Booking is subject to availability of accommodations, and does not include any transport required to get to the Centre.)</li>
<li>
<strong>$1700</strong> - <u><i>Retreat Pass!!</i></u> - This one allows you to attend a retreat of your choice within the first 3 years of opening! This pass is valid for a retreat of up to 7-nights. (Please note that one-week retreat passes do not apply to certification courses or training intensives; and do not include transportation required to get to the Centre.)</li>
<li>
<strong>$2500</strong> - <u><i>Sponsor A Tico </i></u>- We plan on becoming an integral member of the community, and part of this involves training locals (i.e. Ticos) in the practice of Thai Massage, in order to provide a new potential vocation for them. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact This Will Have</h3>
<p>In our current age, it is evident to us that many of the world's issues would be eliminated through a greater connection to one another and to our innate humanity. We plan on being that place; not only to create experiences of connection and belonging, but also to educate on this exact concept and practice.</p>
<p>When we are able to touch a life, the effect of this ripples outwards to eventually reach the world. We have an impact on everyone who comes to Navina Costa Rica, and from there they go out and touch the lives of the people around them.</p>
<p>Whether through the vehicle of compassionate touch (one of our trainings) or through the offerings of retreat leaders, including but not limited to: yoga, martial arts, meditation and mindfulness, organic living, permaculture and renewable energy, people will leave the centre with an entirely new set of tools with which they can not only help themselves to thrive, they can facilitate that in others as well.</p>
<p>With your support and contributions we can continue dedicating our time and energy to building Navina Costa Rica into a place that brings out the best of who you are and who you can be!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you simply cannot contribute, there are other ways to help us reach our goal if you feel compelled to assist us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the word out to your tribe goes a HUGE way to helping us build awareness and positive-noise around our campaign.</li>
<li>When you share this campaign through email or social media, please make sure you include some text, describing why you think we're a worthy cause - it helps people to connect to us, through you! (A first-hand example of touching the lives around us).</li>

Join us in making this world a better place to live for all.</strong></p></div>","Independence Is True FreedomAs per WHO, globally there are 285 million visually impaired people, of whom 39 million are blind. 56% of the blind are women and 90% of them live in poverty. This community experiences many challenges in performing simple daily activities. Most of them are dependent on their friends and family to help them accomplish these tasks. But it is unrealistic to think that someone will always be around for 24 x 7 to assist. The pandemic situation is adding more to their existing challenges.Audible Vision App is an effort towards making a meaningful impact towards this community. App will leverage accessible technology and artificial intelligence to help them be independent by helping them perform some of the daily chores on their own and help stay safe during the pandemic.As Helen Keller rightly said -  ""There is no better way to thank God for your sight than by giving a helping hand to someone in the dark.""One App – MultipurposeApp is built on Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and has a very simple and intuitive voice driven UI interface for ease of operation. AI modules will process video and images form camera to assist users perform a specific task. It is a one shop stop to handle many routine activities like:1. Smart Text - Identify product name or nearby shop names.2. Expiry Date – First ever app to detect expiry date of products.3. Pandemic Safety – First ever app to integrate this feature in an app specifically made for visually challenged users.In current pandemic situation, it is even more challenging for the blind people to know if their surrounding is safe.Mask detector - If a person is wearing mask or not.Crowd detector - Equally important is to identify if the commute path is not crowded.This app will help users to make right choices through advanced machine learning visual processing.4. Find Text – Search a specific product or shop through it's name. For example, if a user wants to find a specific medicine in a medical box; instead of reading all the text, user can ask for a specific medicine name to be searched and the app will alert as soon as it's camera is directed towards it.5. Document – Read books or text documents.6. Barcode – Read barcode to get product information if available.7. Voice commands & feedback – The app can be controlled using voice commands and the results will be communicated through voice or sound.FREE App - Most of the apps developed for this community have expensive subscriptions or annoying popping Ads at regular intervals. Our app is free for users and all features are accessible with a non intrusive Ads. Ads can be removed through a nominal cost subscription.This model will help us cover app support and maintenance costs and at the same time, users with low income (which forms a large base of this community) can access all app features for free.User Privacy -  Some apps require users to share their data and usage.

<p><strong>Time to get a group X studio back in Newberg</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic was hard on all of us in different ways. One of the saddest days was when Newberg Oregon’s Excell Fitness, a beloved gym and community gathering place, closed its doors for good in December of 2020. This wasn’t just any gym. Excell was a place of connection, accountability, growth and joy. Parents could bring their young children to the kids room and enjoy an hour to take care of themselves. Lifelong friendships were formed here. Members and staff would often comment on how everyone there felt like family. There’s a reason for this--people bond in special ways when they do something challenging together. </p> <p><i>We need a cycling and group exercise studio back in our community now more than ever.</i></p>

<h3>Introducing Mentis</h3>
<p>Liam McClintock:  I am a senior D1 athlete involved in Greek life at Yale and balancing a busy work schedule. The need to be more productive after social nights of drinking led me to partner with Margaret to create the best defense against a hangover that science could provide.</p>
<p>Margaret Morse: I am a senior Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Major at Yale who worked with Yale professors and outside advisors to research and develop a supplement, Mentis, which combats the underlying causes of a hangover.</p>
<p>We are joined by two advisors: </p>
<p>John Friedman has experience in healthcare venture capital as CEO of Easton Capital, serving on the board of several biotech and pharmaceutical companies. He provides business guidance and product advice.</p>
<p>Andrew Young is an MIT graduate who works for McKinsey and co-founded an energy chew company called Revivo. He brings entrepreneurial experience and aids in product development.</p>
<p>Hangovers cost the U.S. over $200 billion according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's about $1.37 for each drink consumed by Americans! Together with your help we are aiming to prevent the damaging effects of alcohol on the body, terrible feelings of hangover, and productivity lost due to alcohol hangovers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Mentis aims to address the four root causes of a hangover: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493864102/jx9mr3ok8y75gocuq8ek.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Basically the combination of nutrients in Mentis are intended to prime your body for alcohol consumption. For a more in-depth explanation of the science behind our formula, click <a href=""https://mentislife.com/pages/science"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Below is a full list of ingredients in Mentis:</p>
<ul>
<li>L-Glutamine</li>
<li>N-Acetyl L-Cysteine</li>
<li>Sulforaphane (from broccoli extract)</li>
<li>Epigallocatechin gallate (from green tea extract)</li>
<li>Mung bean powder</li>
<li>Sodium</li>
<li>Vitamin C</li>
<li>Vitamin B1 (as thiamine hcl)</li>
<li>Vitamin B2 (as riboflavin)</li>
<li>Vitamin B3 (as niacin and niacinamide)</li>
<li>Vitamin B6 (as pyridoxine hcl)</li>
<li>Vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin)</li>
<li>Magnesium aspartate</li>
<li>Zinc (as aspartate and monomethionine)</li>
<li>Potassium</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How we came up with the formula</h3>
<p>We both put in countless hours of research in developing our formula for Mentis. For the past seven months we have strived to answer one question: How can modern science prevent hangovers? </p>
<p>Answering this question has involved a two-step process. First, we learned about the physiological effects of alcohol on the body, and read all of the scientific literature on the causes of hangover symptoms. After identifying the root causes, the second step involved researching nutrients and compounds that have been shown in studies to combat the processes that lead to hangovers.</p>
<p>Once we had a general idea for our formula, we wrote up our findings (which we encourage you to check out <a href=""https://mentislife.com/pages/science"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>) and sent out our paper to various nutritionists and Yale professors, meeting with them and incorporating their feedback on the science behind our formula. We also partnered with a pharmaceutical manufacturer, which provided further advice on our final formulation based on years of experience creating supplements.</p>
<p>We then ordered the ingredients online and mixed together various combinations until we had ourselves and our test panel feeling hangover-free after drinking, accounting for factors such as type of alcohol and duration of sleep. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we are running this campaign</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our pharmaceutical manufacturer requires $20,000 in order to produce a minimum production run of Mentis packets. This includes packaging, flavoring, and blending the formula, as well as certifying its safety for consumption. Essentially this campaign is a way for you to pre-order Mentis, while helping us make it available for others online and in retail.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Additional information</h3>
<p>The final Mentis product should be delivered to your doorstep no later than the end of April. All rewards include a pass to Mentis's kickoff launch party at Yale (you must be 21+ years old to attend) by the end of April. Please drink responsibly.</p>
<p>Mentis is expected to retail at $5 per serving. </p>

John Friedman has experience in healthcare venture capital as CEO of Easton Capital, serving on the board of several biotech and pharmaceutical companies. He provides business guidance and product advice.
Andrew Young is an MIT graduate who works for McKinsey and co-founded an energy chew company called Revivo. He brings entrepreneurial experience and aids in product development.
Hangovers cost the U.S. over $200 billion according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's about $1.37 for each drink consumed by Americans! Together with your help we are aiming to prevent the damaging effects of alcohol on the body, terrible feelings of hangover, and productivity lost due to alcohol hangovers.
 
How it works
Mentis aims to address the four root causes of a hangover: 

Basically the combination of nutrients in Mentis are intended to prime your body for alcohol consumption. For a more in-depth explanation of the science behind our formula, click here. 
Below is a full list of ingredients in Mentis:

L-Glutamine
N-Acetyl L-Cysteine
Sulforaphane (from broccoli extract)
Epigallocatechin gallate (from green tea extract)
Mung bean powder
Sodium
Vitamin C
Vitamin B1 (as thiamine hcl)
Vitamin B2 (as riboflavin)
Vitamin B3 (as niacin and niacinamide)
Vitamin B6 (as pyridoxine hcl)
Vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin)
Magnesium aspartate
Zinc (as aspartate and monomethionine)
Potassium


 
How we came up with the formula
We both put in countless hours of research in developing our formula for Mentis. For the past seven months we have strived to answer one question: How can modern science prevent hangovers? 
Answering this question has involved a two-step process. First, we learned about the physiological effects of alcohol on the body, and read all of the scientific literature on the causes of hangover symptoms. After identifying the root causes, the second step involved researching nutrients and compounds that have been shown in studies to combat the processes that lead to hangovers.
Once we had a general idea for our formula, we wrote up our findings (which we encourage you to check out here) and sent out our paper to various nutritionists and Yale professors, meeting with them and incorporating their feedback on the science behind our formula. We also partnered with a pharmaceutical manufacturer, which provided further advice on our final formulation based on years of experience creating supplements.
We then ordered the ingredients online and mixed together various combinations until we had ourselves and our test panel feeling hangover-free after drinking, accounting for factors such as type of alcohol and duration of sleep. 
 
Why we are running this campaign

Our pharmaceutical manufacturer requires $20,000 in order to produce a minimum production run of Mentis packets. This includes packaging, flavoring, and blending the formula, as well as certifying its safety for consumption. Essentially this campaign is a way for you to pre-order Mentis, while helping us make it available for others online and in retail.
 

Additional information
The final Mentis product should be delivered to your doorstep no later than the end of April. All rewards include a pass to Mentis's kickoff launch party at Yale (you must be 21+ years old to attend) by the end of April. Please drink responsibly.
Mentis is expected to retail at $5 per serving. 
Please check out our website for more information. If you have any questions regarding our campaign, feel free to email us at contact@mentislife.com. Thanks!

<p>I grew up with ADHD in a time when it wasn’t understood, I had a hard time in life. It wasn’t until my late 20’s that I discovered <i>belly</i> breathing. This effective technique had a profound effect on me personally and helped lead me to where I am today.  As a mother, yoga teacher and mindfulness instructor, I spend a lot of time working with children who have difficulties with attention, whether from anxiety, trauma, depression, or attention deficit disorders.  Often calming is necessary for the class and individuals to function. Since I have personally experienced the benefits of <i>belly breathing</i>, I have shared this with my students, including my own children, with impressive results.  It was tricky figuring out how to teach children the abstract concept of diaphragmatic breathing to children, while keeping them engaged long enough to experience the benefits. That’s when I created <strong>BellieBuddies!</strong></p>
<p><strong>BellieBuddies</strong> are little plush toys, designed to ergonomically fit on a child’s belly. They were designed with weighted tummies to provide bio-feedback, are tall enough to be seen while lying down, and are wide enough to prevent falling off.  <strong>BellieBuddies</strong> are a fun and simple way to teach breath to kids so it actually makes sense to them. Breathing with a <strong>BellieBuddie</strong> is like playing a fun game with your breath. This keeps kids engaged long enough to experience some of the benefits, such as relaxation, balance, mood stabilization, and stress release. Using classical conditioning principals, children relate <strong>BellieBuddie</strong> breathing to feelings of wellbeing.  This activates the reward centers in the brain, making them want to do it again and again, triggering these positive effects.  We all know that when we do things repetitively, we condition ourselves to have an automatic response.  Imagine if you could help your children learn to have an automatic response of relaxation, instead of stress or anxiety.  I know this is possible, as I have seen it work with many of my students!  That is why I created <strong>BellieBuddies.</strong></p>
<p>I am asking for your help.  The first stage, the design and production of the first <strong>BellieBuddie, </strong>Sakhe, the dolphin, is complete. The money from this campaign will be used for the second phase which is the creation of companion books, training videos for educators, downloadable meditations, stories, and mindfulness videos for kids. If we go over our goal we will use those funds for stage 3 which is more animal designs, website resources, and advertising strategy.  The sooner we get the <strong>BellieBuddie </strong>project funded, the more families we can serve by introducing them to the benefits of <i>belly breathing and mindfulness.</i></p>
<p>We are asking you to purchase a ‘raw’ <strong>BellieBuddie, </strong>meaning just the plush toy without the companion book or training videos, which are still under development, pending the success of this funding effort.  When you purchase your <strong>BellieBuddie</strong> today, you will receive your very own Sakhe, the dolphin within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>We are confident that we will reach our goal of selling 1,200 <strong>BellieBuddies. </strong>However, if we do not, we will use the money we do raise to further develop the full <strong>BellieBuddie </strong>concept, with the meditation downloads and training videos first on our list.  We appreciate your help and support and would LOVE to see you with Sahke, the dolphin in your home. Thank you.</p>

</div></div>","I grew up with ADHD in a time when it wasn’t understood, I had a hard time in life. It wasn’t until my late 20’s that I discovered belly breathing. This effective technique had a profound effect on me personally and helped lead me to where I am today.  As a mother, yoga teacher and mindfulness instructor, I spend a lot of time working with children who have difficulties with attention, whether from anxiety, trauma, depression, or attention deficit disorders.  Often calming is necessary for the class and individuals to function. Since I have personally experienced the benefits of belly breathing, I have shared this with my students, including my own children, with impressive results.  It was tricky figuring out how to teach children the abstract concept of diaphragmatic breathing to children, while keeping them engaged long enough to experience the benefits. That’s when I created BellieBuddies!
BellieBuddies are little plush toys, designed to ergonomically fit on a child’s belly. They were designed with weighted tummies to provide bio-feedback, are tall enough to be seen while lying down, and are wide enough to prevent falling off.  BellieBuddies are a fun and simple way to teach breath to kids so it actually makes sense to them. Breathing with a BellieBuddie is like playing a fun game with your breath. This keeps kids engaged long enough to experience some of the benefits, such as relaxation, balance, mood stabilization, and stress release. Using classical conditioning principals, children relate BellieBuddie breathing to feelings of wellbeing.  This activates the reward centers in the brain, making them want to do it again and again, triggering these positive effects.  We all know that when we do things repetitively, we condition ourselves to have an automatic response.  Imagine if you could help your children learn to have an automatic response of relaxation, instead of stress or anxiety.  I know this is possible, as I have seen it work with many of my students!  That is why I created BellieBuddies.
I am asking for your help.  The first stage, the design and production of the first BellieBuddie, Sakhe, the dolphin, is complete. The money from this campaign will be used for the second phase which is the creation of companion books, training videos for educators, downloadable meditations, stories, and mindfulness videos for kids. If we go over our goal we will use those funds for stage 3 which is more animal designs, website resources, and advertising strategy.  The sooner we get the BellieBuddie project funded, the more families we can serve by introducing them to the benefits of belly breathing and mindfulness.
We are asking you to purchase a ‘raw’ BellieBuddie, meaning just the plush toy without the companion book or training videos, which are still under development, pending the success of this funding effort.  When you purchase your BellieBuddie today, you will receive your very own Sakhe, the dolphin within 4 weeks.
We are confident that we will reach our goal of selling 1,200 BellieBuddies. However, if we do not, we will use the money we do raise to further develop the full BellieBuddie concept, with the meditation downloads and training videos first on our list.  We appreciate your help and support and would LOVE to see you with Sahke, the dolphin in your home. Thank you.

<h3>A Summary of My Allergy ID</h3>
<p>We are a group of under 18 girls from Newcastle and we have started My Allergy ID as part of the Young Enterprise scheme, which we hope to succeed in as well as make an impact on the catering industry. We hope to empower sufferers of food allergies to be able to make more informed decisions about what they eat, no matter where and what they are eating.</p>
<p>Our idea stemmed from the headlined, shocking stories in the news recently of food allergy suffers dying after consuming products from high-street cafes, which were incorrectly labelled. After seeing these stories we knew that something had to change; this terrible mistake could easily reoccur and have an equally devastating result. So, we have created My Allergy ID, an app which will eradicate this problem and massively aid both consumers and eateries, which we are in collaboration with, when it comes to food allergens.</p>
<p>We would really appreciate your help and funding as, with this our app has the potential to save lives and change the way food-allergy sufferers eat forever.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We hope to raise £500 and with this we can work to further developing our app . We as a company do not need £500 pounds so we will be donating a quarter of the money we raise to The Anaphylaxis Campaign. This is charity solely focused on supporting people at risk of severe allergic reactions, which is exactly the group of people we hope to support. Your funds would help us to launch our app as soon as possible, before this error could be made again and another life could be taken due to a easily-made mistake.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is clear to see what a huge impact our app could have on, not only the UK, but in time the world at large. This is going to change the way food-allergen sufferers eat forever - with security and comfort. I am sure if you, yourself, either suffer from food-allergies or know someone who does, you will know what a massive burden this can be for some people and what major precautions they need to take. This app will be so valuable to the world and the catering industry, because of its promotion of ease, convenience but most importantly safety.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Due to our age, we have little expertise in approaching larger businesses in the catering sector. This is a step we need to take to generate awareness and also to start to amke our way into larger highstreet chain stores, where it will have the most impact. We have already generated great interest from a few one-store cafes and plan to trail our app here as soon as it is launched. To overcome this we have contacted a particular highstreet cafe for guidance and advice on approaching larger businesses, which has been really valuable and helpful.</p>
<p>We are aware that creating an app has its risks due to the nature of it being a huge success or just a flop. However, we really believe in what we have created and we have no doubt that it has the potential to become a huge success and one day something that people will struggle to consider not having. We are prepared to take this risk due to such strong belief that it could change the catering industry and the way people eat forever.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If contributing is not an option for you, there are many other ways you can help us. Something we are focusing on at the moment is getting the word out and raising awareness of our app and this campaign. This is a key element and any support in anyway would be hugely appreciated. So please share our campaign on social media by using Indiegogo share tools because we believe our app has the potential to save lives and to the mass it provides the security and safety when buying food, that is missing in the industry at present.</p>

Add it to the freezer for 2 hours and it will stay cool for an hour.         </p><p>Applying heat to areas of your body can naturally soothe and improve the flow of oxygen through your blood stream.  The improved blood flow is why heat packs have been popular for so long when sick or recovering from an injury, or dealing with cramps as it increases the extensibility of collagen tissues, decreasing joint stiffness, pain and relieving muscles in a post-acute phase of healing while increasing the flow of proteins, nutrients, and oxygen to the affected area.</p><p>The Heat packs are also able to be cooled to help with pain management and general comfort.  Like using ice packs or ice baths, cold is great for recovery by reducing blood flow to a particular area of your body you can help reduce inflammation and pain.</p><p>There is nothing worse than trying to sleep through hot, sticky summer nights, CHONKERS are the ""cool side of the pillow"" that will stay cooler longer. Beyond just comfort, the temperature can be very helpful as soothing sensory input for calming panic attacks, over-stimulation, or anger episodes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/OYWOK5Q.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>The Heat + Lavender Sensory Packs have the same effects as the Heat Pack but with  the additional benefit of Lavender added. </p><p>Using scents as a relaxation aid has been used for ages and is known as Aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is simply the use of scents to trigger a reaction from your mind. The connections that your mind makes to particular scents can trigger this without you even knowing. Adding naturally calming scents like Lavender stimulates relaxing responses from your brain's limbic system. This works very similar to using a relaxing scented candle, a bubble bath, a sleep spray, essential oils, or sleeping with comforting smell of a loved ones sweatshirt to help you calm down or sleep better.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/800/954/ef14dd8e497cb801ea62a54992f9b359_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1601403235&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=537c6ad05a1b1dca5a65216a3d37d7ad"" src=""""/></p><p>The Plush Sensory Pack allows you to fluff up your Chonker while adding minimal weight.  The plush pack is similar to a traditional teddy bear with a cushy soft feel that still plumps up his belly depending on how stuffed you want him while continuing to allow you to control the weight.</p><p> </p><h3> The Team</h3><p>Our team of designers and product experts has been working with occupational therapists to create new sensory products for people with anxiety, depression, autism/ASD, and other disorders for 5 years. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604686649/e1gx2wz6jrwik03ryunh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Personally, throughout my life I have lived with social and generalized anxiety and sought methods to help manage it.

You can add weight up to 8 lbs, microwavable heat, cooling, and relaxing scents to customize to what calms you.Chonkers are specifically designed to help find what calms you and recreate that relaxation technique. Anxiety is not one size fits all and neither is how you manage it, which is why we designed Chonkers to be compatible with multiple interchangeable Sensory Packs.  The combination of different Sensory Packs allows you to take advantage of a variety of occupational therapy techniques shown to help manage anxiety and improve mood, customizing your Chonker for what is most effective for you.    Calming   Comfort  Customizable   Meet Chonky Bear! For pre-order we will be offering perks for supporters of an adorably chubby version of a classic Teddy Bear, Chonky Bear and a selection of 4 different Sensory Packs.   Chonky Bear is a premium super-soft plush Bear built to be durable while remaining soft and breathable. The bear is 16"" in height so large enough for adults as well as children, but able to be condensed for traveling by removing packs.  The back of Chonky Bear features a hidden zippered enclosure to add multiple Sensory Packs. The enclosure is double-lined to support up to 8 lbs of weight.  Each Sensory Pack is designed to be soft and cuddlable within your Chonker but has a different feel, weight, or effect that makes it unique. All packs are easily removable and can be used alone or with any other pack.  There will be 4 different Sensory Packs to choose from at launch: Weight, Heat, Heat + Lavender, and Plush. You can include up to 2 packs at once to add up to 8 lbs of weight or to combine effects like heat and weight.  Adding weight allows you to take advantage of a therapeutic technique known as deep touch stimulation, a  method of adding concentrated pressure to the body to calm the nervous system and promote relaxation.         This technique has become popular among Occupational Therapists and in hospitals as a natural method to calm anxiety. The weight provides a sensation of security much like you experience from cuddling, receiving a hug, or a child being swaddled.        Each weighted pack is 4 lbs and each Chonker can hold 2 packs at a time. There is no particular perfect weight for everybody as it is largely a matter of preference and can change over time as you acclimate to the sensation; however, between plush, heat, and weighted packs you can go from 1 lb to 8 lbs in seconds to find the perfect weight for you.Heat Sensory Packs allow you to warm up your Chonker to take advantage of the soothing physical and mental benefits of Heat Therapy. Pop your Heat Sensory Pack in the microwave for 1 minute and it will remain warm for over 2 hours within your Chonker. Add it to the freezer for 2 hours and it will stay cool for an hour.         Applying heat to areas of your body can naturally soothe and improve the flow of oxygen through your blood stream.  The improved blood flow is why heat packs have been popular for so long when sick or recovering from an injury, or dealing with cramps as it increases the extensibility of collagen tissues, decreasing joint stiffness, pain and relieving muscles in a post-acute phase of healing while increasing the flow of proteins, nutrients, and oxygen to the affected area.The Heat packs are also able to be cooled to help with pain management and general comfort.  Like using ice packs or ice baths, cold is great for recovery by reducing blood flow to a particular area of your body you can help reduce inflammation and pain.There is nothing worse than trying to sleep through hot, sticky summer nights, CHONKERS are the ""cool side of the pillow"" that will stay cooler longer. Beyond just comfort, the temperature can be very helpful as soothing sensory input for calming panic attacks, over-stimulation, or anger episodes.The Heat + Lavender Sensory Packs have the same effects as the Heat Pack but with  the additional benefit of Lavender added. Using scents as a relaxation aid has been used for ages and is known as Aromatherapy. Aromatherapy is simply the use of scents to trigger a reaction from your mind. The connections that your mind makes to particular scents can trigger this without you even knowing. Adding naturally calming scents like Lavender stimulates relaxing responses from your brain's limbic system. This works very similar to using a relaxing scented candle, a bubble bath, a sleep spray, essential oils, or sleeping with comforting smell of a loved ones sweatshirt to help you calm down or sleep better.The Plush Sensory Pack allows you to fluff up your Chonker while adding minimal weight.  The plush pack is similar to a traditional teddy bear with a cushy soft feel that still plumps up his belly depending on how stuffed you want him while continuing to allow you to control the weight.  The TeamOur team of designers and product experts has been working with occupational therapists to create new sensory products for people with anxiety, depression, autism/ASD, and other disorders for 5 years. Personally, throughout my life I have lived with social and generalized anxiety and sought methods to help manage it.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In addition to the many who seek a healthier life, there is an epidemic of an overweight, and unhappy people in the United States. Many of our youth are not taught the importance of nutrition and healthy living in school or at home and they grow up without a foundation in health. At Soturi Fitness and Nutrition, we are working to empower the community through proper tools and information to live healthier lives. Education and empowerment are our best weapons to support those looking to create healthier lives for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>Soturi Fitness and Nutrition will be working with organizations to help kids live healthier, but that is only the beginning.  We have big dreams (including starting our own health and nutrition foundation and working with a wide variety of non-profits) to reach a wider population and make sure kids are supported too!</p>
<p>We need to be kinder to ourselves and to the world. And by doing so, we can all make this world a better place.</p>

That “place” is within each of us but most have no idea it exists. <i>Pure Love Energy returns you to your perfect, natural and divine state of being. </i>This is the power of unconditional love. </p><p>After years of trying to uncover how we could share Pure Love Energy, we finally arrived at our answer...an App (sound the angels singing). <strong>Avaala is a conscious App </strong>designed to support you on your Soul Path while connecting you to your Soul Community. </p><p>The time has come to take our own growth into our hands, our own destiny back into our hearts, go inward and embark on our journey.  The Revolution has begun; it is the Evolution of Consciousness. We invite you to join us. </p><p>~ Mikko, Founder/CCO LoveALL5D &amp; Avaala  </p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>The work has already begun as the Avaala founders &amp; SparkLabsNetwork have been busy creating the App, but there is more to be done before launching in May 2020. </p><p>Without giving it all away, <strong>imagine being immersed in beautifully, conscious curated content and experiences</strong>. While the App supports your own personal journey, <strong>community</strong> will be a significant part of the overall experience.  There will be opportunity to <strong>work with facilitators one-on-one or in group settings</strong>. For example, you will be able to sit in a virtual fire circle with healers, angels, and guides. Or even in a women's circle in the Andes virtually. Pretty amazing, right?</p><p>Through this App technology, ALL of the Pure Love Energy can be accessed by you. You will be able to create a profile. This is not your average profile. This is a sacred space where you'll be able <strong>process your own work, co-create with others and receive conscious content tailored to you.</strong> You will also be able to receive <strong>24-7 Soul guidance and support.</strong></p><p>We are offering you something now so you don't have to wait until we launch for you to feel this Pure Love Energy.   <strong>Please explore the PERKS we have created just for you in exchange for your support.  </strong></p><p>* ALL the funds received will go into the operations costs (see below for details) for the completion of Avaala as an app. </p><p> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>We took many lifetimes to prepare a way for us to channel this Pure Love Energy into an app.  Many times in our journey we thought about giving up but found the heart to continue on.  We needed many years of trials and challenges for us to know we could embody Pure Love Energy and present it to the world. </p><p>We left all attachments, the knowns and comforts behind with our two kids and two cats and journeyed across the US to create Avaala from Pure Love Energy.  Shaman Biji was a Media Technologist with a background in network television as a producer, writer, journalist, talent. During the Dot.com boom, she worked as an executive producer for a cutting edge video news Internet company.  This ignited the spark in her to create using both technology and media.  </p><p>Right Now the world is waking up to the realities of how we feel. We don't have the life we were promised or ever envisioned. Our world is centered around vibrations of lack and deprivation. We are exhausted and yet still unfulfilled.</p><p>It seems as if we can never have enough or be enough. We ask for more, new, different, better, and then feel overwhelmed, stuck and lost.  True Abundance is living in the vibration of being supported by the creative Universe and showing authentic gratitude for this sacred journey called life. Avaala, the app, is ready to contribute to your life. It’s time to activate and claim it now.</p><p>Avaala is a sacred mantra for Conscious Energy.  Avaala’s birth is Pure Love Energy. This energy has created a community which started on Instagram in 2017 and has organically grown to nearly 10,000 people. These fans will no doubt be the App's first customers. </p><p>Don't take our word for it, come be a part of this Pure Love Energy Experience and join our social community.  Follow us on Instagram @loveall5d or join our private Facebook group by searching Love All 5D. <br/> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>If you can't contribute monetarily, we honor you as well. We invite you to share this campaign and help us spread this Pure Love Energy to everyone. Come be a part of the growing LoveALL5D community and experience ALL that is offered. </p><p>Biji &amp; Mikko have turned down investment offers in order to keep the authenticity and purity of this app, this mission, this energy, this love.  We are asking the beautiful hearts of beings like yourself who want to rise up to be a part of a global community and support this epic shift in consciousness. </p><p>Love ALL. </p><p> </p><p><strong>MEET THE TEAM</strong></p><p><strong>Mikko Carrea, CCO &amp; Founder, LoveALL5D/Avaala</strong> </p><ul>

That “place” is within each of us but most have no idea it exists. Pure Love Energy returns you to your perfect, natural and divine state of being. This is the power of unconditional love. After years of trying to uncover how we could share Pure Love Energy, we finally arrived at our answer...an App (sound the angels singing). Avaala is a conscious App designed to support you on your Soul Path while connecting you to your Soul Community. The time has come to take our own growth into our hands, our own destiny back into our hearts, go inward and embark on our journey.  The Revolution has begun; it is the Evolution of Consciousness. We invite you to join us. ~ Mikko, Founder/CCO LoveALL5D & Avaala   What We Need & What You GetThe work has already begun as the Avaala founders & SparkLabsNetwork have been busy creating the App, but there is more to be done before launching in May 2020. Without giving it all away, imagine being immersed in beautifully, conscious curated content and experiences. While the App supports your own personal journey, community will be a significant part of the overall experience.  There will be opportunity to work with facilitators one-on-one or in group settings. For example, you will be able to sit in a virtual fire circle with healers, angels, and guides. Or even in a women's circle in the Andes virtually. Pretty amazing, right?Through this App technology, ALL of the Pure Love Energy can be accessed by you. You will be able to create a profile. This is not your average profile. This is a sacred space where you'll be able process your own work, co-create with others and receive conscious content tailored to you. You will also be able to receive 24-7 Soul guidance and support.We are offering you something now so you don't have to wait until we launch for you to feel this Pure Love Energy.   Please explore the PERKS we have created just for you in exchange for your support.  * ALL the funds received will go into the operations costs (see below for details) for the completion of Avaala as an app.  The ImpactWe took many lifetimes to prepare a way for us to channel this Pure Love Energy into an app.  Many times in our journey we thought about giving up but found the heart to continue on.  We needed many years of trials and challenges for us to know we could embody Pure Love Energy and present it to the world. We left all attachments, the knowns and comforts behind with our two kids and two cats and journeyed across the US to create Avaala from Pure Love Energy.  Shaman Biji was a Media Technologist with a background in network television as a producer, writer, journalist, talent. During the Dot.com boom, she worked as an executive producer for a cutting edge video news Internet company.  This ignited the spark in her to create using both technology and media.  Right Now the world is waking up to the realities of how we feel. We don't have the life we were promised or ever envisioned. Our world is centered around vibrations of lack and deprivation. We are exhausted and yet still unfulfilled.It seems as if we can never have enough or be enough. We ask for more, new, different, better, and then feel overwhelmed, stuck and lost.  True Abundance is living in the vibration of being supported by the creative Universe and showing authentic gratitude for this sacred journey called life. Avaala, the app, is ready to contribute to your life. It’s time to activate and claim it now.Avaala is a sacred mantra for Conscious Energy.  Avaala’s birth is Pure Love Energy. This energy has created a community which started on Instagram in 2017 and has organically grown to nearly 10,000 people. These fans will no doubt be the App's first customers. Don't take our word for it, come be a part of this Pure Love Energy Experience and join our social community.  Follow us on Instagram @loveall5d or join our private Facebook group by searching Love All 5D.  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute monetarily, we honor you as well. We invite you to share this campaign and help us spread this Pure Love Energy to everyone. Come be a part of the growing LoveALL5D community and experience ALL that is offered. Biji & Mikko have turned down investment offers in order to keep the authenticity and purity of this app, this mission, this energy, this love.  We are asking the beautiful hearts of beings like yourself who want to rise up to be a part of a global community and support this epic shift in consciousness. Love ALL.  MEET THE TEAMMikko Carrea, CCO & Founder, LoveALL5D/Avaala

<h2>Past, Present, and Future</h2>
<p>Apollo Performing Arts Medicine is a traveling athletic training room for performers. I started Apollo to follow my dreams and provide athletic training services to an underserved population. I grew up in Northwest Georgia immersed in dance, choir, and musical theatre with dreams set on Broadway before finding a new passion for athletic training. Learning about performing arts medicine led to the realization that I could combine these two passions to create a fulfilling career in an exciting field. Apollo Performing Arts Medicine joins these two passions and is the product of my dreams and hard work. In the next few years, I would like to develop this company into a brick and mortar clinic with various health and wellness professionals coming together as a team to provide optimal support for our performing artists in South Florida.</p>
<p>The unique needs and environments of performing artists mean that their health is best managed by those skilled in treating this population. Apollo Performing Arts Medicine connects performers with healthcare practitioners experienced in performing arts medicine, many of whom are or were performers as well. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Your contribution to this campaign will provide much needed and deserved medical services to performing artists.  </span></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540003190/hxzflgftahl63ofgfmnr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hi there, I am Rowena Morais. Wife, mom of three and at time of writing, 46 years old. An editor and writer based in Kuala Lumpur, who specialises in learning, communication and content. I run, lift weights and practise taekwondo. Diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in June 2018, I am blown away by how quickly my life has shifted, both for me and those around me.</p>
<p>I am making sense as best I can of what has happened. I believe in taking action, finding my way around a problem and moving forward. The reason I'm sharing what I learn along the way is because I hope that it may be of use to those on similar journeys.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What is this charity campaign for?</strong></h3>
<p>Let's start with some simple worldwide statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.1 million deaths due to cancer in 2018 for both sexes, all ages  according to the International Agency for Research on cancer;</li>
<li>2.1 million new breast cancer cases and 676 thousand deaths due to breast cancer in 2018;</li>
<li>Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the overwhelming majority of countries around the world, and 75% of deaths occur in low and middle-income countries.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, cancer is a problem that's been around for some time now and affects a great many people -  man, woman, old and young.</p>

<p>I am raising money for cancer research so that the vital work that needs to continue into cures, new breakthroughs, experimental drugs and innovative therapies may continue. As I am in Malaysia and getting treatment locally, I would like to direct the funds raised to a local non-profit organisation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540003667/cfoopd79mq9masdh8unz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>Who benefits from this charity campaign?</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540000291/xcmvhqimpcafytwmz3ud.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The beneficiary of this campaign is <a href=""https://www.cancerresearch.my/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cancer Research Malaysia</a>, an independent and non-profit cancer research organisation based in Malaysia which is funded entirely by donations, research grants and the public. Cancer Research Malaysia conducts research into niche cancers often found in the Asian population.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What will you help achieve?</strong></h3>
<p>Your contribution, financial or otherwise, will help direct even more awareness, continued education and research into cancer as a whole.</p>
<p>We need to press for continued vigilance in how we actively manage our health because this is something we need to take charge of.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What are the goals of Cancer Research Malaysia?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Improving the survival rates of Asian cancer patients, focusing on neglected areas of research;</li>
<li>Empowering Asians to have the proper screening and treatment;</li>
<li>Improving survival rates by being more accessible, focusing on providing existing cures to patients rather than sit on inaction and potentially losing lives;</li>
<li>Making affordable and timely treatments by repurposing drugs, acknowledging the reality that developing new cures are costly and risky;</li>
<li>Putting Malaysia in the global spotlight for cancer research by collaborating with top scientists around the world, and working to nurture the next generation of Malaysian cancer researchers.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why am I doing this and why does this matter?</strong></h3>
<p>I want to take positive, proactive action to deal with cancer that goes beyond my individual experience. I'm hoping that the work I do to shine a light on this and the collective effort of many through donations, social media and discussion, will help drive a greater good that can only be achieved by a collective spirit and not just the one individual.</p>
<p>This makes it wider than the one experience.  This helps me feel like I am contributing to something bigger than myself, and ultimately, it will make a difference and be impactful to many others.</p>
<p>This matters because this is not just my story – it is the story of literally millions of people around the world, people like you and me and their families. This matters because we all can take action to make a difference, in whatever capacity we wish.</p>
<p>It matters because this is both personal and universal.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What do I need from you? </strong></h3>
<p>If my story resonates, I urge you to make a donation of any amount towards this cause. Give as you can, give what you will.</p>
<p>I also urge you to spread the word through social media or any other means because you can and the work you do will make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How much? </strong></h3>
<p>A special note to say <u>any</u> amount will do.</p>
<p>While I appreciate the unstinting generosity of the backers who have contributed in the early stages of this campaign, I want to stress that every single dollar counts. So feel free to donate even USD1, USD5 or USD10 or any amount you feel comfortable and able to give. What matters is your involvement, contribution and amplification of this message to help carry this campaign through.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What do you get from this?</strong></h3>
<p>An opportunity to be part of something bigger than yourself and which will have tremendous meaning to those impacted by this disease.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>How long is this campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>6 months from October 2018 – March 2019.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>On the perk  </strong></h3>
<p>For those who would like to take me up on my offer of the 30 min skype call, feel free to reach out via email so we can lock in a date/time that suits both. You can email me at hello AT rowenamorais.com.</p>

Who is Rowena Morais? 

Hi there, I am Rowena Morais. Wife, mom of three and at time of writing, 46 years old. An editor and writer based in Kuala Lumpur, who specialises in learning, communication and content. I run, lift weights and practise taekwondo. Diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in June 2018, I am blown away by how quickly my life has shifted, both for me and those around me.
I am making sense as best I can of what has happened. I believe in taking action, finding my way around a problem and moving forward. The reason I'm sharing what I learn along the way is because I hope that it may be of use to those on similar journeys.
 
What is this charity campaign for?
Let's start with some simple worldwide statistics:

18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.1 million deaths due to cancer in 2018 for both sexes, all ages  according to the International Agency for Research on cancer;
2.1 million new breast cancer cases and 676 thousand deaths due to breast cancer in 2018;
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the overwhelming majority of countries around the world, and 75% of deaths occur in low and middle-income countries.

As you can see, cancer is a problem that's been around for some time now and affects a great many people -  man, woman, old and young.

Infographic   source: The Economist
I am raising money for cancer research so that the vital work that needs to continue into cures, new breakthroughs, experimental drugs and innovative therapies may continue. As I am in Malaysia and getting treatment locally, I would like to direct the funds raised to a local non-profit organisation.

 
Who benefits from this charity campaign?

The beneficiary of this campaign is Cancer Research Malaysia, an independent and non-profit cancer research organisation based in Malaysia which is funded entirely by donations, research grants and the public. Cancer Research Malaysia conducts research into niche cancers often found in the Asian population.
 
What will you help achieve?
Your contribution, financial or otherwise, will help direct even more awareness, continued education and research into cancer as a whole.
We need to press for continued vigilance in how we actively manage our health because this is something we need to take charge of.
 
What are the goals of Cancer Research Malaysia?

Improving the survival rates of Asian cancer patients, focusing on neglected areas of research;
Empowering Asians to have the proper screening and treatment;
Improving survival rates by being more accessible, focusing on providing existing cures to patients rather than sit on inaction and potentially losing lives;
Making affordable and timely treatments by repurposing drugs, acknowledging the reality that developing new cures are costly and risky;
Putting Malaysia in the global spotlight for cancer research by collaborating with top scientists around the world, and working to nurture the next generation of Malaysian cancer researchers.

 
Why am I doing this and why does this matter?
I want to take positive, proactive action to deal with cancer that goes beyond my individual experience. I'm hoping that the work I do to shine a light on this and the collective effort of many through donations, social media and discussion, will help drive a greater good that can only be achieved by a collective spirit and not just the one individual.
This makes it wider than the one experience.  This helps me feel like I am contributing to something bigger than myself, and ultimately, it will make a difference and be impactful to many others.
This matters because this is not just my story – it is the story of literally millions of people around the world, people like you and me and their families. This matters because we all can take action to make a difference, in whatever capacity we wish.
It matters because this is both personal and universal.
 
What do I need from you? 
If my story resonates, I urge you to make a donation of any amount towards this cause. Give as you can, give what you will.
I also urge you to spread the word through social media or any other means because you can and the work you do will make a difference.
 
How much? 
A special note to say any amount will do.
While I appreciate the unstinting generosity of the backers who have contributed in the early stages of this campaign, I want to stress that every single dollar counts. So feel free to donate even USD1, USD5 or USD10 or any amount you feel comfortable and able to give. What matters is your involvement, contribution and amplification of this message to help carry this campaign through.
 
What do you get from this?
An opportunity to be part of something bigger than yourself and which will have tremendous meaning to those impacted by this disease.
 
How long is this campaign?
6 months from October 2018 – March 2019.

<p>Os Aponte has dedicated his life to fitness. He grew up in Puerto Rico, and by age 16 he was running a free community martial arts school for over 120 locals. He knew the value of a physical practice and wanted to share it with his community. Os went on to become a sergeant in the U.S. Army, motivating his unit to keep in peak physical fitness and helping soldiers struggling to meet weight and height standards overcome their challenges and get promoted. He then became a personal trainer and worked throughout the San Diego area since 2004. In 2005, he took his first kettlebell class at the original Iron Core, with founder Sarah Lurie.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">(From left to right, Os, David, Sarah, and Jesus)</p>
<p>He immediately understood the value of kettlebell training and went on to get his certifications. He began working at Iron Core and there he fully developed his system of physical training, which he now calls the Four Chambers. The Four Chambers incorporate <a href=""https://www.ironcoreway.com/basic-training"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bodyweight</a>, <a href=""https://www.ironcoreway.com/kettlebell-training"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">kettlebell</a>, <a href=""https://www.ironcoreway.com/conventional-wisdom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">conventional</a>, and <a href=""https://www.ironcoreway.com/x"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">circuit training</a> to challenge the body while also keeping it safe and healthy. This is the culmination over 20 years of experience, education, and successful implementation of knowledge that comes from all of his physical practices; from martial arts, dance, kettlebells, Z-health, boxing, and good ole' fashion bicep curls. If you don't want to take our word for it, check out <a href=""https://www.ironcoreway.com/testimonials"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Os' testimonials</a>. </p>
<p>After going to business school at SDSU, Os realized that his passion for teaching is what motivates him and his clients every day. Not only does he want to open a school of movement in City Heights, but just like he did in Puerto Rico, he wants to give back to the community. Iron Core will offer discounted rates to members of the community, law enforcement, and first responders. He also wants to work with local businesses and artists to create a community atmosphere. He believes that fitness is a practice and for many, the best way to practice anything is with a community that supports you. </p>

<p>La Ermita - a community space that matters</p>
<p>In July of 2001, I quit my job as a hospital based speech-pathologist to open up my own community wellness center, borrowing $6000 from my parents to launch this venture. I developed and published my own unique ""radical inclusion"" centered therapy approach and immediately put it into practice, initially focusing on kids with autism spectrum disorders, adults with stroke and other traumatic brain injuries and teen agers who were struggling with depression and anxiety. <br/><br/>In the fifteen years that followed, I successfully started over 25 different all volunteer outreach programs, was the first non-profit yoga and wellness center in the Pacific Northwest, was the first social justice based yoga organization with a mission of radical inclusion and never sending anyone away for lack of funds, and the first yoga center in the area to focus on truly accessible yoga, for all bodies, for all minds. </p>
<p>In 2015, with the market saturated in Seattle and the cost of living more than I could sustain running the non-profit, I took the leap to move to the small rural community in Mexico where I had already been planting roots for almost ten years. <br/><br/>When I arrived in the town in early 2006, I began to ask folks what support they needed for things like depression and anxiety. At that time, as I was still an outsider, I was met with lots of ""we don't get depressed here,"" or ""that's an American thing to worry about."" But as I continued to cultivate my ties to the community, learning to speak fluent Spanish, beginning to teach English and offer small groups for mindfulness and movement, the community response began to shift. Pretty soon I had lots of people, and particularly women, asking me if I could help them with various physical ailments. But every single time, when they entered into the tiny backyard studio I had built, they immediately began to cry and talk about things like domestic violence, feeling trapped and isolated, alcoholism, the stressors of poverty, and yes, depression and anxiety, <br/><br/>I kept my reach small for many years, wanting to ensure that I had the right reputation with the community, that I understood - as well as an outsider could - their particular concerns and struggles, and that if I built something bigger it would be embraced and utilized and not seen as simply a ""gringo"" thing. I continued offering free one on one sessions, and expanded to offering twice weekly free mindfulness groups. I started offering free Bedside Yoga sessions in people's homes to help alleviate suffering and isolation associated with chronic pain - most people here not even able to afford over the counter pain medications. <br/><br/>After my sister died in October of 2019, I earned a small but significant sum of money for being the executor of her estate. Erin was always so encouraging and proud of everything I did, and in particular admired my capacity and passion for reaching the most vulnerable among us. It only made sense to me then, to invest all of the money I earned from her estate into this place that would also honor her. <br/><br/>Last year, finally having a bit of start up funding, a secure ground and, more than anything, watching the rapid growth and gentrification of the town, with the most marginalized of the community being further pushed to the margins, I knew I had to do something, especially before someone else did - putting in a ""yoga studio"" or some other space that would feel inaccessible to my local friends. <br/> </p>
<p>The initial purchase of the land was approximately $22K and I have spent an additional $30K + of my own money to get us where we are. But the money has run out. </p>
<p>In order for me to complete the main ground level space, that will include a simple garden, an office/library/welcoming area and a bathroom, I need an additional $10,000. With this part of the project completed, I will be able to open this healing space to the local community at no charge. I will be able to offer workshops, classes and retreats to visitors at a fair price that will help to sustain the work we will do here together.<br/><br/>Once the ground floor is fully established, I hope to be able to build a second floor that will include a small two bedroom apartment and a therapy room which will then create a 100% self-sustaining model so that I will be able to grow my reach and programs to support the community. <br/> </p>
<p>I have created several unique perks that I hope you will benefit from. I would love to have you come here and visit, to see and experience this place that you have helped to create, and to know that you have made a real difference in the lives of people who would otherwise never have access to the healing opportunities of La Ermita or a place like it!<br/> </p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will continue to build little by little, investing all of my income over the next several years to see the project through to completion. In the meanwhile, I will use the main hall to offer individual therapy, group classes, arts opportunities, mindfulness and meditation groups, and weekly faith services to my local community. I will also use it to offer once monthly ""free"" thrift shops - asking tourists and ""snowbirds"" to donate unused or unwanted items to a centralized location for folks who are struggling financially to be able to get simple household items such as towels, sheets, dishes, clothing, books, tools and toys. </p>
<p><br/>The Impact</p>
<p>I have worked in community organizing and outreach and the healing arts, including clinical therapy for all of my professional life. I have a proven track record of making things happen. As I settle into my second half of life, I am becoming increasingly interested in small, personal impact over large programs.<br/><br/>La Ermita is just that. We will offer free therapy and classes, as well as volunteer programs for people who are home-bound with critical or terminal illnesses and end of life care. We will provide a safe space for women of the community to gather and share and to know their own worth. We will offer a transformative, curative space which will allow people who otherwise don't have the means to even leave the pueblo to be able to experience a feeling of being transported beyond the limitations of poverty and lack of access. We will offer a space where kids can come and learn tools for self-regulation and valuing of self. We will replicate the experience of The Samarya Center, where all people feel invited, welcomed and celebrated. <br/><br/>The best part is that you, as a donor, can come here and see it and experience it for yourself, and know that you helped to create this and see with your own eyes the changes you have made in the lives of people who desperately need these opportunities. <br/> </p>
<p>I have done this before and I can do it again. Please look at my press, the videos about what we accomplished at Samarya, and the short documentaries about the community we built together in Seattle. I have the experience, I have the passion, I have the capacity and I have a solid start.  Now I just need the funds. <br/><br/>Please help to make La Ermita a reality. </p>

But as I continued to cultivate my ties to the community, learning to speak fluent Spanish, beginning to teach English and offer small groups for mindfulness and movement, the community response began to shift. Pretty soon I had lots of people, and particularly women, asking me if I could help them with various physical ailments. But every single time, when they entered into the tiny backyard studio I had built, they immediately began to cry and talk about things like domestic violence, feeling trapped and isolated, alcoholism, the stressors of poverty, and yes, depression and anxiety, I kept my reach small for many years, wanting to ensure that I had the right reputation with the community, that I understood - as well as an outsider could - their particular concerns and struggles, and that if I built something bigger it would be embraced and utilized and not seen as simply a ""gringo"" thing. I continued offering free one on one sessions, and expanded to offering twice weekly free mindfulness groups. I started offering free Bedside Yoga sessions in people's homes to help alleviate suffering and isolation associated with chronic pain - most people here not even able to afford over the counter pain medications. After my sister died in October of 2019, I earned a small but significant sum of money for being the executor of her estate. Erin was always so encouraging and proud of everything I did, and in particular admired my capacity and passion for reaching the most vulnerable among us. It only made sense to me then, to invest all of the money I earned from her estate into this place that would also honor her. Last year, finally having a bit of start up funding, a secure ground and, more than anything, watching the rapid growth and gentrification of the town, with the most marginalized of the community being further pushed to the margins, I knew I had to do something, especially before someone else did - putting in a ""yoga studio"" or some other space that would feel inaccessible to my local friends.  
The initial purchase of the land was approximately $22K and I have spent an additional $30K + of my own money to get us where we are. But the money has run out. 
In order for me to complete the main ground level space, that will include a simple garden, an office/library/welcoming area and a bathroom, I need an additional $10,000. With this part of the project completed, I will be able to open this healing space to the local community at no charge. I will be able to offer workshops, classes and retreats to visitors at a fair price that will help to sustain the work we will do here together.Once the ground floor is fully established, I hope to be able to build a second floor that will include a small two bedroom apartment and a therapy room which will then create a 100% self-sustaining model so that I will be able to grow my reach and programs to support the community.  
I have created several unique perks that I hope you will benefit from. I would love to have you come here and visit, to see and experience this place that you have helped to create, and to know that you have made a real difference in the lives of people who would otherwise never have access to the healing opportunities of La Ermita or a place like it! 
If I do not reach my entire goal, I will continue to build little by little, investing all of my income over the next several years to see the project through to completion. In the meanwhile, I will use the main hall to offer individual therapy, group classes, arts opportunities, mindfulness and meditation groups, and weekly faith services to my local community. I will also use it to offer once monthly ""free"" thrift shops - asking tourists and ""snowbirds"" to donate unused or unwanted items to a centralized location for folks who are struggling financially to be able to get simple household items such as towels, sheets, dishes, clothing, books, tools and toys. 
The Impact
I have worked in community organizing and outreach and the healing arts, including clinical therapy for all of my professional life. I have a proven track record of making things happen. As I settle into my second half of life, I am becoming increasingly interested in small, personal impact over large programs.La Ermita is just that. We will offer free therapy and classes, as well as volunteer programs for people who are home-bound with critical or terminal illnesses and end of life care. We will provide a safe space for women of the community to gather and share and to know their own worth. We will offer a transformative, curative space which will allow people who otherwise don't have the means to even leave the pueblo to be able to experience a feeling of being transported beyond the limitations of poverty and lack of access. We will offer a space where kids can come and learn tools for self-regulation and valuing of self. We will replicate the experience of The Samarya Center, where all people feel invited, welcomed and celebrated. The best part is that you, as a donor, can come here and see it and experience it for yourself, and know that you helped to create this and see with your own eyes the changes you have made in the lives of people who desperately need these opportunities.  
I have done this before and I can do it again. Please look at my press, the videos about what we accomplished at Samarya, and the short documentaries about the community we built together in Seattle. I have the experience, I have the passion, I have the capacity and I have a solid start.  Now I just need the funds. Please help to make La Ermita a reality.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Maar wij wel.Het begon toen onze zoon Mikai 3 weken oud was. Wat voelden we ons machteloos als we naar zijn ruwe, beschadigde huid keken en de met bloed bevlekte doeken. Om nog maar te zwijgen over de met tranen bevlekte dagen en slapeloze nachten. En altijd: de jeuk. Pijnlijk, onvoorspelbaar, non-stop. Onze eerste jaren als ouders stonden in het teken van overleven, met daartussen kortstondige momenten van vreugde. Toen Quilan 18 maanden later werd geboren, hoopten we dat het anders zou zijn. Maar we hadden het mis. Niemand begreep de hulpeloosheid, de frustratie, de wanhoop. De vreugde van een sprankje hoop, gevolgd door een fikse teleurstelling. We voelden het allemaal - beide keren.  Mikai and Quilan We probeerden alles. Maar niets werkte. De ene crème na de andere, het ene dieet na het andere, de ene specialist na de andere. Zelfs de de beste artsen in het land konden niet helpen. Maar we geloofden dat er meer was.Gewoon goed genoeg was niet acceptabel. Onze kinderen verdienden alleen het beste.Toen geen enkel zalfje werkte, besloten we onze eigen crème te maken. We gingen  van het ene lab naar het andere; vele wezen ons af. Eindelijk vonden we een klein vegan lab met een passie voor het maken van pure, natuurzuivere, eerlijke huidverzorging.Eerst ontwikkelden we formules in kleine hoeveelheden, die we op onze zoon testten. Onze eerste samples waren mislukkingen, maar opgeven was geen optie. Anderhalf jaar lang hebben we de formule beetje bij beetje aangepast.Totdat we een doorbraak hadden.  Itch-Free Oat Cream Het laatste testsample veranderde ons leven! Voor het eerst sinds zijn geboorte zagen we de huid van onze zoon al na drie dagen helen, weer zacht worden en zonder scheurtjes. En de opluchting was niet tijdelijk. Het bleef. Kan jij je voorstellen wat dat met ons deed? Nu is onze familie vrij.De opluchting die we hebben ervaren willen we nu met de rest van de wereld delen. We willen mensen kennis laten maken met dit product. Omdat wij weten dat er andere ouders zijn die hiermee worstelen. En daarom hebben we jouw steun nodig. Steun onze campagne en onze missie.Door deze campagne te steunen krijg je niet alleen een fles Tiny Todd Itch-Free Oat Cream, maar kun je er ook voor zorgen dat het product beschikbaar wordt voor alle ontstemde ouders die worstelen met het eczeem van hun kind.Het ingezamelde bedrag zorgt ervoor dat we de eerste batch kunnen produceren en leveren. Daarnaast biedt het ons de mogelijkheid om andere producten te ontwikkelen, zoals een bodylotion, een douchegel en een zonnebrandcrème.  Het ingezamelde bedrag is op te delen in de volgende mogelijkheden. Bij:
5.000 Euros - zijn we in staat om alle grondstoffen in te kopen en kunnen we starten met de productie van onze eerste batch. 
10.000 Euros - zijn we in staat om duurzamer te verpakken en bedrukken. Wij willen namelijk een bijdrage leveren aan het welzijn van de wereld door een duurzame onderneming te zijn. 
15.000 Euros - zijn we in staat om een internationale marketing campagne te starten, zodat we meer mensen kunnen bereiken. De opluchting die we hebben ervaren door de Tiny Todd Itch-Free Oat Cream kunnen we dan met de rest van de wereld delen. 
20.000 Euros - zijn we in staat om een start te maken met de ontwikkeling van het volgende product in onze productlijn.
 Als ouders wil je alleen het beste voor je kind. Je wilt genieten van ieder kostbaar moment. En je gunt je kind de vreugde van... vrij van jeuk zijn.Vrij om te spelen, te lachen, om hun tenen in het zand te graven. Vrij om 's nachts goed te slapen. Vrij om te genieten van de jeugd die ze verdienen. Maar ook als ouders zijn we vrij om de ouders te zijn die we altijd wilden zijn - met meer liefde, meer rust, meer tijd voor onszelf en elkaar. Meer in staat om te geven.We zijn helemaal genezen en kunnen voor het eerst sinds jaren opgelucht ademhalen.

But we do.It began when our son Mikai was three weeks old, and spiralled into an endless loop of tear-stained days and sleepless nights. Raw, broken skin and blood-spotted blankets. Mystified doctors and inconclusive tests.And always: The Itch. Agonizing, unpredictable, non-stop.Our first years as parents were all about survival, with brief, fragile moments of joy in between.When our second son, Quilan was born 18 months later, we hoped things would be different. But we were wrong.Nobody understood the helplessness, the frustration, the desperation. The wild surge of hope, followed by the crushing pain of disappointment. We felt it all - times two. Mikai and Quilan We tried everything. But nothing worked.Cream after cream, diet after diet, specialist after specialist. With each attempt, we prayed the relief would last. But it never did. Even the best doctors and specialists in the country said they could only do so much. But we believed there had to be a solution.We could never accept just good enough. Our children deserve the best.When no cure worked, we decided to make our own.

<h3>Hello! I am Christel and I created Hua Hee, a heritage card game to engage elderly in Singapore. </h3>
<p>This inspiration came from trying to find activities to engage my grandma as she got older. Having seen my grandfather suffer from dementia, my family did not want the same to happen to my grandma.</p>
<p><strong>Unique SG Heritage Designs</strong><br/>I drew more than 20 popular Singapore heritage items and compiled them into a card game deck. Hua Hee is designed to encourage people to actively engage their elderly loved ones at home so as to help slow down the progression of dementia. Hua Hee means happy in Hokkien, and it will hopefully bring happiness to elderly.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Help me continue creating!</strong><br/>I hope to continue creating activities to better engage elderly in Singapore and the response gathered from this campaign will help me better understand how much of this is needed. So... please support me!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495899913/xjuxpowoxn8ii6r7ciou.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dementia is a big problem worldwide. One in 10 people aged 60 and above in Singapore have dementia. By 2030, people with Dementia in Singapore will double. Having seen my family cope with dementia in the home, i'm quite certain that there are many like us, who are also at a loss when it happens. Through a series of exercises and healthy eating, my family has seen a significant improvement in my grandma's memory and disposition.</p>
<p>I've also tested it out with elderly and the response has been quite positive. The elderly who are unable to engage in the game can also recognise some of the heritage items fondly.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495938209/uohzluwxktruyudewyoa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>According to the National Institutes of Health in the United States, brain-training exercises slows down dementia between 33 to 48%. Fighting Dementia requires a consistent and committed effort. The Hua Hee card game is definitely not a silver bullet to mental illnesses, but it's a good start if this encourages you to spend more time with your elderly loved ones.</p>
<p>We are also constantly on the look out for more ways to keep my grandma engaged at home. Please share with me if you have any ideas. I would also be very happy if you could support this fight against Dementia by sharing this with your family and friends!</p>
<h3>More about Hua Hee</h3>
<p>Hua Hee can be played as a matching/snap game pack. 22 beautifully sketched designs of heritage items in Singapore such as Kueh Tutu, clogs and Tingkat are available. The vibrantly coloured cards come with elderly-friendly and fits snugly in your palm which makes for easy shuffling!</p>
<p>The Hua Hee Match game pack comes with two sets of each design, allowing caregivers to facilitate the memory matching game. Both Hua Hee Match and Snap game packs are suitable for a group of 2 - 4 players. All game packs come with a set of instructions.</p>

Hello! I am Christel and I created Hua Hee, a heritage card game to engage elderly in Singapore. 
This inspiration came from trying to find activities to engage my grandma as she got older. Having seen my grandfather suffer from dementia, my family did not want the same to happen to my grandma.
Unique SG Heritage DesignsI drew more than 20 popular Singapore heritage items and compiled them into a card game deck. Hua Hee is designed to encourage people to actively engage their elderly loved ones at home so as to help slow down the progression of dementia. Hua Hee means happy in Hokkien, and it will hopefully bring happiness to elderly.
Help me continue creating!I hope to continue creating activities to better engage elderly in Singapore and the response gathered from this campaign will help me better understand how much of this is needed. So... please support me!

<p>According to the American Academy of Dermatology and WebMD, by the time women are 40, roughly 40% display visible signs of hair loss. Many women who experience this level of hair loss have expressed having higher levels of depression, low self-esteem, anxiety, and other potentially detrimental emotional states. Unfortunately, in the hair industry, custom wigs and hairpieces often range from $3,500 to $10,000, of which many people are already facing large medical bills and/or difficult financial circumstances so they cannot afford a wig.  When choosing between paying for medication or purchasing hair prosthesis, understandably, many forego custom hair solutions.

<h3>Everyone Experiences Grief</h3>
<p>I got hit by the ""grief truck"" when I was 36 years old. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2018 I lost my first husband, Lance, to a sudden and terrible battle with cancer. When he died on August, 7, 2018 after just two months of illness, I was left broken, lost, and confused. I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to recover, but I made him a promise as he took his last breaths, ""I don't know how I'll be okay again, but I promise you, I'll figure it out."" </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596475521/zlrinwhfamyvp4ilys3z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596475656/clcqtacsvvyivbirseco.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Three months later, I ""skipped Thanksgiving"" and traveled solo to Costa Rica. The first night I spent on the Pacific Coast, watching the sunset over the ocean, was the first night I felt I could breathe—it was the first time I felt hope. I returned to Costa Rica at least once a month for six months before deciding in May 2019, to move here. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596475771/asasack8n7qzi9pfscpt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Many Modern Cultures Don't Understand or Help</h3>
<p>What Costa Rica taught me is that <strong>many modern cultures don't support people who are devastated by grief.</strong> They don't understand. Many modern cultures get awkward and weird and want to sweep grief under the rug. They want people to be ""strong,"" to ""pull themselves up from their bootstraps,"" to ""move on,"" to ""get over it,"" to ""succeed in the face of trials and struggles."" Many modern cultures want a success story. They don't want to see the depths of the loss or the ongoing, painful struggle of continuing to live after losing the most important person (or people) in your life. </p>
<p>In contrast to the many modern cultures whose pace of life and values are causing so much stress and illness, Costa Rica's lifestyle is famous for promoting health and healing. Slowing down, eating healthfully, and having a sense of community. You may not be able to stay here forever, but you may be able to carry home some of what you experience and learn. And you may, through your time here, become a healing presence for others. </p>
<h3>Brave Heart Ranch Will Provide Community &amp; Support</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597518927/jo4ce2ojnlbbtneesw6i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The goal of Brave Heart Ranch will be to <strong>provide a grief community and opportunity for legacy</strong> for those who are lost in their own seas of grief. It will provide an honest, straightforward approach to loss. One that doesn't get awkward or weird. One that accepts wailing and thrashing. That accepts the clinging to coping mechanisms of all kinds while encouraging the healthy ones. One that promotes therapy. One that sees the importance of continued connection with those who have died. One that won't tell you you should be ""better"" after a year, or two years, or 10 years. Because grief never goes away. It just changes. </p>
<h3>Brave Heart Ranch Will Offer</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A physical, in-person grief retreat.</strong> Those who visit will enjoy yoga overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a glass of wine at sunset, time with animals of all types, horseback riding, paddleboarding, other opportunities for exercise, healthy Costa Rican cooking, and massage or other forms of therapy, if desired. These retreats are fully customizable—if someone wants to come and just cry for two weeks uninterrupted, that's okay, too. </li>
<li>
<strong>Online grief community.</strong> Through the website and social media pages, Brave Heart Ranch will provide an honest look at what grief really is, aiming to normalize and encourage all the confusing facets of emotions that accompany grief at all stages of the grief process. Whether it's been a week or 10 years, grief continues and is <i>normal</i>. </li>
<li>
<strong>Opportunities for memorials and legacy</strong>. Brave Heart Ranch isn't just for the those who are able to come to Costa Rica in person. It's a place where people from all over the world can memorialize their loved ones in one of the most beautiful places on earth. It's also a place where those who are facing a terminal illness can create a legacy, helping support those who are left behind in the wake of loss. </li>
<li>
<strong>A columbarium park space for the interment of ashes</strong>. Brave Heart Ranch will provide a small, peaceful park at the Ranch with several columbariums designed to hold urns for the interment of ashes. Niches will be available for purchase when the park space is complete.  </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597519439/ntucme4xj1mxh0gkhh9w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>We will help other people who are grieving and searching for hope to experience their own brief moment of relief as a sign that it's possible to live again after loss.</strong> We will also help normalize the grief experience and provide a community of support online to help those who cannot visit the Ranch in person. </p>
<p>Brave Heart Ranch is a property on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast that has all the key elements required for turning it into the perfect <strong>Grief Retreat Center and Living Memorial. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This Ranch itself will include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Horses, and opportunities for grooming and riding for those who visit—horses are known to be incredibly therapeutic animals</li>
<li>Cows, and opportunities to feed/milk/pet the animals</li>
<li>Lots of dogs, sheep, chickens, and pigs</li>
<li>Wildlife, including monkeys, parrots, and even the occasional jaguar sighting</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Lodging with jungle, and/or ocean views</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Opportunities for yoga, nature hikes, and other forms of exercise</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Opportunities for ocean activities, like kayaking, stand up paddleboarding, and swimming </span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Opportunities for popular Costa Rican tours, including ziplining, rainforest canopy hikes, white water rafting, and surfing</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Local Costa Rican cooking/food</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Opportunities for other forms of therapy, for those who are interested, including talk therapy, myofascial release/massage therapy, assistance from social workers, occupational therapists, acupuncture, and access to a grief doula (some of these services will be arranged for online/Zoom-style meetings with US-based therapists and coaches)</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Time with other people who have experienced deep loss and understand how overwhelming it can feel, even months or years later</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597519962/fephvgeygbgffvg6widk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The extended community will include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Live online stories and events to allow people from around the world to experience the Ranch</li>
<li>Private Facebook groups for grief support</li>
<li>Newsletters including expert resources and commentary on grief and loss</li>
<li>Opportunities for memorializing loved ones </li>
<li>Opportunities for creating legacies (including scholarships, special programs, and events)</li>
<li>First chance access to scholarships or other discounts to visit the Ranch, as they become available</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>W</strong><strong>e need a lot of help!</strong> The property is 66 acres on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast. It's about two hours from both international airports, and It's a steal at the price it's being listed for. That said, it's still not cheap. <strong>The cost of the entire 66-acre property is $320,000</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>This is an IMMEDIATE NEED.</strong> To secure the property, we need at least $180,000 ASAP, although a more realistic number is $250,000. After securing the property, all other goals will be much more realistic to meet, even if they take more time. If you're interested in being part of a Founder's Circle (you'd be commemorated as such, and receive other perks) to help secure the land, please see the ""Founder's Circle"" options listed in the Perks—there are two levels, Silver and Gold. There are limited opportunities for this perk and as soon as we meet this goal, the listing will be removed. </li>
<li>Even if a Founder's Circle donation is outside your reach, this is exactly why we need <i>all</i> the donations and eyes on the project as we can get. <strong>Your $5, $10, or $50 donation can really help.</strong> And beyond that, SHARE. With 36,000 $5 donations, we could secure the property. That's a lot of donations, sure, but it's <i>doable</i>.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The property also has a beautiful, 4-bedroom house (the house that would be used for guests) that's 60% built, but needs to be finished. I've asked the realtor how much this would cost. His <strong>estimate is between $60,000 and $120,000.</strong> </p>
<p>The property also currently includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two small cabins that need repairs</li>
<li>A large 3,000-square foot building that can be renovated and used for larger group retreats with hostel-style bunks and shared bathrooms</li>
<li>A second large, enclosed space that can be renovated and used for animals</li>
<li>An additional private apartment with ocean views</li>
<li>A large, open-air restaurant/meeting space.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these structures need to be cleaned up, undergo minor repairs, and be prepped for guests and/or animals. <strong>That's roughly $30,000 more</strong>. </p>
<p>There are two cleared terraces with amazing ocean views where we would like to build additional cabins for guests and a large, open-air yoga and fitness studio. <strong>Costs will vary depending on the type of structure built, but would be roughly $50,000 for four cabins and the studio. </strong></p>
<p>There are two more areas higher up in the hills that need to be cleared of brush and would later be perfect for additional cabins or other meeting spaces. This would be a future project, but we'd like to start clearing the land and prepping the trails to access these spots for future use. <strong>This will cost roughly $5,000.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total cost to fully prepare Brave Heart Ranch for onsite visitors: $525,000. The online community can be started almost immediately, with little up-front cash necessary. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We are also committed to starting the Ranch and moving forward with aspects of the Grief Community as soon as possible, even if full funding isn't met. Please see the FAQ section for more details. </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597523235/pcxtwnw5iy9sclwe5dg1.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<h3>What We Have</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Knowledge, skills, and expertise in opening community-style centers</strong>. I helped open two, 70,000+ square foot community/fitness centers in the United States. I'm fully capable of managing this type of project from the ground-up. </li>
<li>
<strong>Knowledge, skills, and expertise in fitness/health</strong>. I hold a Master's Degree in Exercise Science, including certifications in Exercise Physiology, Yoga, Sports Nutrition, and Sports Conditioning. I taught Exercise Science at a University in Texas and I've been published in national magazines, including <i>Men's Journal</i>. </li>
<li>
<strong>The animals to start the Ranch. </strong>We currently own 18 cows, 8 horses, 9 dogs, 2 sheep, and 2 pigs. </li>
<li>
<strong>The knowledge to run a ranch.</strong> My new husband is a life-long rancher, bull-rider, and horse trainer. We're not just diving into the world of owning and running a ranch without the proper know-how. </li>
<li>
<strong>An onsite cook.</strong> My new husband is a trained cook and has cooked in resorts and hotels in major tourist areas in Costa Rica.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Connections to therapists and other specialists</strong> ready to come on board and offer assistance. These include: <ul>
<li>Grief doulas </li>
<li>Grief and trauma therapists</li>
<li>Occupational therapists</li>
<li>Art therapists</li>
<li>Yoga instructors</li>
<li>Social workers</li>
<li>Other non-traditional healers, if desired by clientele</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>We're fully bilingual</strong>. Since moving to Costa Rica, I've learned Spanish and am conversationally proficient. My new husband is a native Costa Rican and is fully fluent. We can provide support and answers to anyone speaking English or Spanish. </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597525302/ofbm6ebufkds3vcksjzn.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact—Everyone Grieves</h3>
<p><strong>Everyone will experience a major loss at some point in their lives. Grief is universal</strong>.</p>
<p>But grief and loss are not easy, and most people need help finding a way to navigate grief effectively, especially after experiencing the death of a spouse, child, parent, or sibling.</p>
<p><strong>Brave Heart Ranch will give mourners a ""toolbox,"" so to speak, of ways to work on healing</strong>, both while at the Ranch, and while at home. By donating, you're helping invest in promoting healing in those who have lost a loved one, while also acknowledging that grief and loss are <i>normal</i>. That we, as a society, need to be prepared to support those whose lives have been shattered after loss. And the only way we can do that is if we work toward this goal together. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with starting any business, there are always risks. While I've been talking extensively to the realtor to get an idea of real costs associated with starting the Ranch, there are of course challenges with buying real estate and construction. Fortunately, I've been involved in starting two large recreation centers in the past, and I'm familiar with what it takes to get a center like this up off the ground.</p>
<p>Also, the knowledge and skills I bring to the table with my background in exercise and sport science and yoga, as well as my husband's experience with livestock and cooking, mean that there won't be extensive costs associated with hiring employees when starting the actual center. And with assistance from my own therapist and other Licensed Counselors and professionals, I feel confident I can create a safe and healing environment for those experiencing significant grief. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, please spread the word! If you know someone who is in mourning, let them know that we hope to have this retreat center up soon. <strong>And please, share on social media</strong>. The more people who are aware of Brave Heart Ranch and our goals, the more likely we will be to fully fund the project and to be able to help and serve in the ways we hope to help and serve. </p>

I got hit by the ""grief truck"" when I was 36 years old. 
In 2018 I lost my first husband, Lance, to a sudden and terrible battle with cancer. When he died on August, 7, 2018 after just two months of illness, I was left broken, lost, and confused. I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to recover, but I made him a promise as he took his last breaths, ""I don't know how I'll be okay again, but I promise you, I'll figure it out."" 


Three months later, I ""skipped Thanksgiving"" and traveled solo to Costa Rica. The first night I spent on the Pacific Coast, watching the sunset over the ocean, was the first night I felt I could breathe—it was the first time I felt hope. I returned to Costa Rica at least once a month for six months before deciding in May 2019, to move here.

They want people to be ""strong,"" to ""pull themselves up from their bootstraps,"" to ""move on,"" to ""get over it,"" to ""succeed in the face of trials and struggles."" Many modern cultures want a success story. They don't want to see the depths of the loss or the ongoing, painful struggle of continuing to live after losing the most important person (or people) in your life. 
In contrast to the many modern cultures whose pace of life and values are causing so much stress and illness, Costa Rica's lifestyle is famous for promoting health and healing. Slowing down, eating healthfully, and having a sense of community. You may not be able to stay here forever, but you may be able to carry home some of what you experience and learn. And you may, through your time here, become a healing presence for others. 
Brave Heart Ranch Will Provide Community & Support

The goal of Brave Heart Ranch will be to provide a grief community and opportunity for legacy for those who are lost in their own seas of grief. It will provide an honest, straightforward approach to loss. One that doesn't get awkward or weird. One that accepts wailing and thrashing. That accepts the clinging to coping mechanisms of all kinds while encouraging the healthy ones. One that promotes therapy. One that sees the importance of continued connection with those who have died. One that won't tell you you should be ""better"" after a year, or two years, or 10 years. Because grief never goes away. It just changes. 
Brave Heart Ranch Will Offer


A physical, in-person grief retreat. Those who visit will enjoy yoga overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a glass of wine at sunset, time with animals of all types, horseback riding, paddleboarding, other opportunities for exercise, healthy Costa Rican cooking, and massage or other forms of therapy, if desired. These retreats are fully customizable—if someone wants to come and just cry for two weeks uninterrupted, that's okay, too. 

Online grief community. Through the website and social media pages, Brave Heart Ranch will provide an honest look at what grief really is, aiming to normalize and encourage all the confusing facets of emotions that accompany grief at all stages of the grief process. Whether it's been a week or 10 years, grief continues and is normal. 

Opportunities for memorials and legacy. Brave Heart Ranch isn't just for the those who are able to come to Costa Rica in person. It's a place where people from all over the world can memorialize their loved ones in one of the most beautiful places on earth. It's also a place where those who are facing a terminal illness can create a legacy, helping support those who are left behind in the wake of loss. 

A columbarium park space for the interment of ashes. Brave Heart Ranch will provide a small, peaceful park at the Ranch with several columbariums designed to hold urns for the interment of ashes. Niches will be available for purchase when the park space is complete.  


We will help other people who are grieving and searching for hope to experience their own brief moment of relief as a sign that it's possible to live again after loss. We will also help normalize the grief experience and provide a community of support online to help those who cannot visit the Ranch in person. 
Brave Heart Ranch is a property on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast that has all the key elements required for turning it into the perfect Grief Retreat Center and Living Memorial. 
This Ranch itself will include: 

Horses, and opportunities for grooming and riding for those who visit—horses are known to be incredibly therapeutic animals
Cows, and opportunities to feed/milk/pet the animals
Lots of dogs, sheep, chickens, and pigs
Wildlife, including monkeys, parrots, and even the occasional jaguar sighting
Lodging with jungle, and/or ocean views
Opportunities for yoga, nature hikes, and other forms of exercise
Opportunities for ocean activities, like kayaking, stand up paddleboarding, and swimming 
Opportunities for popular Costa Rican tours, including ziplining, rainforest canopy hikes, white water rafting, and surfing
Local Costa Rican cooking/food
Opportunities for other forms of therapy, for those who are interested, including talk therapy, myofascial release/massage therapy, assistance from social workers, occupational therapists, acupuncture, and access to a grief doula (some of these services will be arranged for online/Zoom-style meetings with US-based therapists and coaches)
Time with other people who have experienced deep loss and understand how overwhelming it can feel, even months or years later



The extended community will include: 

Live online stories and events to allow people from around the world to experience the Ranch
Private Facebook groups for grief support
Newsletters including expert resources and commentary on grief and loss
Opportunities for memorializing loved ones 
Opportunities for creating legacies (including scholarships, special programs, and events)
First chance access to scholarships or other discounts to visit the Ranch, as they become available

What We Need
We need a lot of help! The property is 66 acres on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast. It's about two hours from both international airports, and It's a steal at the price it's being listed for. That said, it's still not cheap. The cost of the entire 66-acre property is $320,000. 


This is an IMMEDIATE NEED. To secure the property, we need at least $180,000 ASAP, although a more realistic number is $250,000. After securing the property, all other goals will be much more realistic to meet, even if they take more time. If you're interested in being part of a Founder's Circle (you'd be commemorated as such, and receive other perks) to help secure the land, please see the ""Founder's Circle"" options listed in the Perks—there are two levels, Silver and Gold. There are limited opportunities for this perk and as soon as we meet this goal, the listing will be removed. 
Even if a Founder's Circle donation is outside your reach, this is exactly why we need all the donations and eyes on the project as we can get. Your $5, $10, or $50 donation can really help. And beyond that, SHARE. With 36,000 $5 donations, we could secure the property. That's a lot of donations, sure, but it's doable.  

The property also has a beautiful, 4-bedroom house (the house that would be used for guests) that's 60% built, but needs to be finished. I've asked the realtor how much this would cost. His estimate is between $60,000 and $120,000. 
The property also currently includes:

Two small cabins that need repairs
A large 3,000-square foot building that can be renovated and used for larger group retreats with hostel-style bunks and shared bathrooms
A second large, enclosed space that can be renovated and used for animals
An additional private apartment with ocean views
A large, open-air restaurant/meeting space.

All of these structures need to be cleaned up, undergo minor repairs, and be prepped for guests and/or animals. That's roughly $30,000 more. 
There are two cleared terraces with amazing ocean views where we would like to build additional cabins for guests and a large, open-air yoga and fitness studio. Costs will vary depending on the type of structure built, but would be roughly $50,000 for four cabins and the studio. 
There are two more areas higher up in the hills that need to be cleared of brush and would later be perfect for additional cabins or other meeting spaces. This would be a future project, but we'd like to start clearing the land and prepping the trails to access these spots for future use. This will cost roughly $5,000.
Total cost to fully prepare Brave Heart Ranch for onsite visitors: $525,000. The online community can be started almost immediately, with little up-front cash necessary. 
We are also committed to starting the Ranch and moving forward with aspects of the Grief Community as soon as possible, even if full funding isn't met. Please see the FAQ section for more details. 

What We Have


Knowledge, skills, and expertise in opening community-style centers. I helped open two, 70,000+ square foot community/fitness centers in the United States. I'm fully capable of managing this type of project from the ground-up. 

Knowledge, skills, and expertise in fitness/health. I hold a Master's Degree in Exercise Science, including certifications in Exercise Physiology, Yoga, Sports Nutrition, and Sports Conditioning. I taught Exercise Science at a University in Texas and I've been published in national magazines, including Men's Journal. 

The animals to start the Ranch. We currently own 18 cows, 8 horses, 9 dogs, 2 sheep, and 2 pigs. 

The knowledge to run a ranch. My new husband is a life-long rancher, bull-rider, and horse trainer. We're not just diving into the world of owning and running a ranch without the proper know-how. 

An onsite cook. My new husband is a trained cook and has cooked in resorts and hotels in major tourist areas in Costa Rica.  

Connections to therapists and other specialists ready to come on board and offer assistance. These include: 
Grief doulas 
Grief and trauma therapists
Occupational therapists
Art therapists
Yoga instructors
Social workers
Other non-traditional healers, if desired by clientele



We're fully bilingual. Since moving to Costa Rica, I've learned Spanish and am conversationally proficient. My new husband is a native Costa Rican and is fully fluent. We can provide support and answers to anyone speaking English or Spanish. 



The Impact—Everyone Grieves
Everyone will experience a major loss at some point in their lives. Grief is universal.
But grief and loss are not easy, and most people need help finding a way to navigate grief effectively, especially after experiencing the death of a spouse, child, parent, or sibling.
Brave Heart Ranch will give mourners a ""toolbox,"" so to speak, of ways to work on healing, both while at the Ranch, and while at home. By donating, you're helping invest in promoting healing in those who have lost a loved one, while also acknowledging that grief and loss are normal. That we, as a society, need to be prepared to support those whose lives have been shattered after loss. And the only way we can do that is if we work toward this goal together. 

Risks & Challenges
As with starting any business, there are always risks. While I've been talking extensively to the realtor to get an idea of real costs associated with starting the Ranch, there are of course challenges with buying real estate and construction. Fortunately, I've been involved in starting two large recreation centers in the past, and I'm familiar with what it takes to get a center like this up off the ground.
Also, the knowledge and skills I bring to the table with my background in exercise and sport science and yoga, as well as my husband's experience with livestock and cooking, mean that there won't be extensive costs associated with hiring employees when starting the actual center. And with assistance from my own therapist and other Licensed Counselors and professionals, I feel confident I can create a safe and healing environment for those experiencing significant grief. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, please spread the word! If you know someone who is in mourning, let them know that we hope to have this retreat center up soon. And please, share on social media. The more people who are aware of Brave Heart Ranch and our goals, the more likely we will be to fully fund the project and to be able to help and serve in the ways we hope to help and serve.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What's TLR #3 about?</h3>
<p>The Local Rebel is a zine publication that aims to educate and empower our youth. In past issues, we’ve covered primers on feminism and decolonisation, uncovered class issues and xenophobia, navigated queer identities and more! This time round, we wanted to take it slow, focus on just one crucial issue: especially so in today's world wracked by a pandemic, a fraught political climate, and numerous flashpoints surrounding race, religion, and sexuality. </p>
<p>Dig into TLR #3 for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A comic about family estrangement</li>
<li>How to spot red flags in relationships</li>
<li>An art therapy directive!</li>
<li>An essay on conversion therapy for queer folk</li>
<li>A tarot and yoga guide for 2020</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>

<p>Our team is dedicated to making this zine an accessible and fun educational resource. Expect not just thoughtful essays, but also ‘breathers’ for you to process and appreciate our zine: playlists, colouring pages, and more! This zine is also colour-coded, so you know off the bat how heavy a particular piece can get- and you can flip to a section that’s slightly easier to deal with. The front section will contain contain more mental health-related issues, while the back section speaks to broader feminist issues.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Zine 3 is now UPSIZING</strong>! While the fundraising was going on, we had a fantastic response from readers &amp; contributors alike, and we couldn't resist: <strong>we're adding 27 NEW PAGES to the zine!!</strong> This does mean printing costs have changed, but we don't want to change the zine price either: that wouldn't be fair to those who have bought it, and we believe in our message AND in making this important information accessible. Indiegogo won't let us increase the fundraiser amount either, which is not a big deal- we're counting on you to help us reach the total goal!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this issue doesn't have the same sponsorship as the last issue, so this zine will cost more to print. What this means is that we'll be shouldering more of the financial burden ourselves than before, and we'll need your help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing costs (500 copies) -̶ ̶$̶3̶3̶0̶0̶ ̶  $4400</li>
<li>Contributors' fees - $900</li>
<li>Shipping costs; handling and printing perks; Indiegogo fees (5% of everything raised &amp; bank transfer for fundraising in SGD) -  ̶$̶3̶4̶2̶ $397</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>That means <strong>we need $1155 more: and we're counting on you!</strong></p>
<p>You'll be able to get not only this latest zine, but many goodies exclusive to this fundraiser. We're going big (then going home) with this very last crowdfund, and our contributors have poured their heart and soul into offering you these lovely perks, so we hope you love them too. All of these are offered at a discounted price, so grab them before they run out!</p>
<p>Even if we don't hit our fundraiser goal, the zines will be print-to-order, which means you'll still receive the zine and any perks you've selected! </p>
<p>Shipping costs are based on <a href=""https://www.singpost.com/sites/default/files/filefield_paths/PostageRates-MailingGuidelines_V201903_Digital.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Singpost's postage rates</a>. We ship worldwide. The zines and perks will be shipped via normal mail, as registered mail is not currently an option. (If you'd like to opt for registered mail, that is available on our Ecwid store at a later date, but the zine will not be offered at the same discounted price!) </p>
<p>We are also providing up to 15 free copies for those who are unable to afford it- just reach out to us via <a href=""mailto:localfeminists@gmail.com?subject=TLR%20%233%20Free%20Copy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">localfeminists@gmail.com</a>. </p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why Get TLR #3?</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This issue, we’re focusing on the Self. We wanted a look at our personal well-being; patterns and/or behaviours that used to help us survive before but weigh us down now; the invisible battles we fight within ourselves; understanding why we react the way we do. Overall, this zine hopes to show how we can listen to ourselves better. How can we treat ourselves with kindness? How do we tend to our bodies, in a world that continues to other us? </span></p>

<p>In today's fast-paced news cycle, we wanted to create a resource you could slow down and take your time with. Having this in print allows you to hold it in your hands, explore the issues we discuss, sit with all you've learnt, and indulge in the breathers.</p>

<h3>Perks You Can Get!</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We're excited to offer you an array of perks this time round, which you can get alongside this zine! We wanted to pull out all the stops as well as pay tribute to all our contributors, from this issue and previous issues, so we asked them to offer whatever piece of joy and/or art they would like to showcase.

</ul></div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","What's TLR #3 about?
The Local Rebel is a zine publication that aims to educate and empower our youth. In past issues, we’ve covered primers on feminism and decolonisation, uncovered class issues and xenophobia, navigated queer identities and more! This time round, we wanted to take it slow, focus on just one crucial issue: especially so in today's world wracked by a pandemic, a fraught political climate, and numerous flashpoints surrounding race, religion, and sexuality. 
Dig into TLR #3 for:

A comic about family estrangement
How to spot red flags in relationships
An art therapy directive!
An essay on conversion therapy for queer folk
A tarot and yoga guide for 2020
And more!

 


 
Our team is dedicated to making this zine an accessible and fun educational resource. Expect not just thoughtful essays, but also ‘breathers’ for you to process and appreciate our zine: playlists, colouring pages, and more! This zine is also colour-coded, so you know off the bat how heavy a particular piece can get- and you can flip to a section that’s slightly easier to deal with. The front section will contain contain more mental health-related issues, while the back section speaks to broader feminist issues.
 

 

What We Need & What You Get
Zine 3 is now UPSIZING! While the fundraising was going on, we had a fantastic response from readers & contributors alike, and we couldn't resist: we're adding 27 NEW PAGES to the zine!! This does mean printing costs have changed, but we don't want to change the zine price either: that wouldn't be fair to those who have bought it, and we believe in our message AND in making this important information accessible. Indiegogo won't let us increase the fundraiser amount either, which is not a big deal- we're counting on you to help us reach the total goal!
Unfortunately, this issue doesn't have the same sponsorship as the last issue, so this zine will cost more to print. What this means is that we'll be shouldering more of the financial burden ourselves than before, and we'll need your help with:

Printing costs (500 copies) -̶ ̶$̶3̶3̶0̶0̶ ̶  $4400
Contributors' fees - $900
Shipping costs; handling and printing perks; Indiegogo fees (5% of everything raised & bank transfer for fundraising in SGD) -  ̶$̶3̶4̶2̶ $397

 
That means we need $1155 more: and we're counting on you!
You'll be able to get not only this latest zine, but many goodies exclusive to this fundraiser. We're going big (then going home) with this very last crowdfund, and our contributors have poured their heart and soul into offering you these lovely perks, so we hope you love them too. All of these are offered at a discounted price, so grab them before they run out!
Even if we don't hit our fundraiser goal, the zines will be print-to-order, which means you'll still receive the zine and any perks you've selected! 
Shipping costs are based on Singpost's postage rates. We ship worldwide. The zines and perks will be shipped via normal mail, as registered mail is not currently an option. (If you'd like to opt for registered mail, that is available on our Ecwid store at a later date, but the zine will not be offered at the same discounted price!) 
We are also providing up to 15 free copies for those who are unable to afford it- just reach out to us via localfeminists@gmail.com. 
 

Why Get TLR #3?
This issue, we’re focusing on the Self. We wanted a look at our personal well-being; patterns and/or behaviours that used to help us survive before but weigh us down now; the invisible battles we fight within ourselves; understanding why we react the way we do. Overall, this zine hopes to show how we can listen to ourselves better. How can we treat ourselves with kindness? How do we tend to our bodies, in a world that continues to other us? 
 

 
In today's fast-paced news cycle, we wanted to create a resource you could slow down and take your time with. Having this in print allows you to hold it in your hands, explore the issues we discuss, sit with all you've learnt, and indulge in the breathers.
 
Perks You Can Get!
We're excited to offer you an array of perks this time round, which you can get alongside this zine! We wanted to pull out all the stops as well as pay tribute to all our contributors, from this issue and previous issues, so we asked them to offer whatever piece of joy and/or art they would like to showcase. This is what they came up with: 
3 watercolour prints (A4)  to choose from by our lovely illustrator, Natasha Mamonova
 
You can grab these as a solo companion to your zine, or, if you want to treat yourself, all three! These watercolour illustrations are printed on white cardstock paper.
 

 


Acephobia: a mini-zine (12 pages) by our editor, Qis, satirising ace-exclusionists 

Art & Chill: a mini-zine (16 pages) by our head designer, Myrah, depicting one's journey of mental health through COVID-19 times

Meditation as a Tool for Collective Liberation (8 pages) by our contributor, Leanna, navigating meditation & yoga for marginalised folk 

 



 
You can also get past copies of TLR: Exploration (#1) and TLR: Roots (#2) with the Super TLR Bundle! As they've sold out and we're not doing another print run for these, this will only be available as in PDF form, with TLR: Self (#3) in print. 

 
Stretch Goals
Help us reach our mini-goals to unlock even cooler perks!

 
3 exclusive artworks of embroidered coral reefs on canvas (7x7x1cm) from our comic artist, Clarisse Bu. Clarisse finds ways to embroider unconventional, ‘un-healable’ materials such as primed canvas or paper, using these mediums to create abstract images that appear frozen in motion. The works offered in this perk were created for TLR in their zine’s aesthetic colourway; cool-toned blues and greens with pops of neon-pastel purples and pinks!

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a community activist, I see a very real need for people to learn more about themselves. Of course no one can TELL you who you are, but we all constantly have people molding us along the way. Some of us have a path of destruction laid out for us. Most of us don't realize that we possess all the tools we need to correct that path. Just as a friend, associate, and listener, I've provided peers with my services before I ever realized I possessed the ability to heal with my words and experiences.</p>
<p>Below I've provided a few kind words from people I've shared a moment in time with: </p>
<p><i>“You have definitely helped me several times! Help heal people if that is what your calling is. Love ya.”</i> (K.H., wife &amp; mother, PA)</p>
<p><i>""This is awesome the community needs someone like you! No tips, all words of encouragement! You keep it raw, while remaining pure and genuine simultaneously!"" </i>(K.C. Mother/Healer, PA)</p>
<p><i>""You have always been an honest and positive in my life. Words of truth whether I want to hear them or not. Never steered me wrong.""</i> (M.E. Father/ Content Creator, PA)</p>
<p><i>“The strengths of your counseling are, it's easy to talk to you, it's a very down to earth type of feeling. I believe that is imperative for this profession. People have to feel comfortable and open to talk about certain situations. The next strength is your forward thinking yet realistic attitude towards life, you top it off with positivity. Your advice itself doesn't feels pushed, nor too opinionated, its levelheaded.”</i> (R.W., Mother/Healer)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I honestly do not forsee any challenges for reaching the goal here. I am an overcomer and again if our goal is not met I will still move forward providing an awesome service that I know my community deserves. Because who doesn't deserve to be healed, whole, and loved absolutely? </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are so many avenues to take in helping build strong, positive images and outlooks in our community. If you are someone who can not donate at this time, I'd love for you to do one or ALL THREE of these actions listed below:</p>
<p>1) Please tell a friend to tell a friend about Answer The Bell.</p>
<p>2) I have 2 community outreach programs I participate with and we would love to see your smiling face.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>About Me...</h2><p>Some of you will know me from Instagram and for those of you that don't, the following is about who I am and what I am doing...</p><p>I am Tamara, I'm 30 (ish) and from London in the UK. I am a mother to my 4 amazing children and I work from home running my small baby jewellery business, homeschooling my youngest 3 and managing my new venture 'NOT Dr.Tamara'.</p><p>I have always felt very compelled to help others. The state of the world has always bothered me and since I could think for myself I have had a burning desire to help save the planet. Whilst that may sound crazy, if you know what an empath is you will understand why I am like this. I had never been sure of how I could help save the world, but after launching my alternative health and happiness blog <a href=""http://www.notdrtamara.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.notdrtamara.com</a> last year some strange things started happening. I had written a book a couple of years prior to my blog and shortly after the blogs launch, I started editing the book. The first night I sat down to start the edit, I realised I hated everything about the book. It was just so depressing and I didn't like it one bit. I wanted to write something that would actually help people, something that would make a difference, something that would help save the world! That night everything changed. The moon was full and I will never, ever forget that evening or that moon because that was the night I wrote 'The Happy Diet'. Yes, I wrote the book in one night, something even I find hard to believe but since writing it I have realised that the book came from the universe and was just being channeled through me (yes that may seem odd but I can't think of any other explanation!). After some editing, I released 'The Happy Diet' as an eBook. I had no money to print it properly and hadn't even thought of getting it published or an agent. After months of only a few eBook sales and everyone that had purchased it saying they wished it was a 'proper' book I realised I needed to make it into a 'proper' book. So I started the journey to try and get a publisher. As it was not a normal book and only has 40 pages, I was turned down by a few people that said it wasn't long enough and didn't even bother to read it. Something in my head told me that the only way to get this out there was to self publish and so another journey started. Self publishing was no joke. With no money I had to do everything from the edits, to the design of the cover and pages to the actual putting together of the book for print-and everything in between. I have never had any 'seed' money or investments, all the money I have used so far I have made myself either through the jewellery or consulting and this is why it has taken so long. I don't like to label myself as a 'single parent' but raising my children alone has made it harder and I have been forced to make decisions I wasn't too proud of. I always make sure they eat very well and have the clothing they need, but I haven't we haven't had a holiday in 9 years and every time I have any spare money instead of doing something with them I have put the money into the book. It has taken lot of tears, hard decisions and 3am bedtime but I did what I needed to do. This is why I am now asking for help. It is the week before the launch of the book and I have nothing left. I had hoped for a miracle instead of having to find the money for a marketing campaign to help the sales of the book but it hasn't happened. On Thursday night when I realised this book won't sell without some marketing I put it to the universe. The week had been so stressful but knowing how unproductive stress is I knew I had to let it go. So I did and then on Friday morning I woke up to this message from one of my Instagram family:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Hi Tamara.  Before I woke this morning a little message came through to say to you to set up a go fund me page to help you achieve all that you want to do. What you do is worth a lot in non monetary terms and people would be happy to donate and help. When I get a message I pass it on. I love what you do. Thanks for everything xx</i></p><p>Whilst this was the answer I had prayed for, it wasn't one I was comfortable with. And so another journey began, a journey of accepting that it is okay to ask for help especially if you add value to the world, which I know I do.</p><p>For the last year I have been trying to grow a community of happy minded people on Instagram in the hope that once happy and inspired, they would go on to help others and bring their own magic to the world. So many beautiful broken people have the potential and passion to be amazing, but they just simply lack the tools they need to move on from a negative past and see how great they are. This is what 'The Happy Diet' is about; giving people the tools they need to live a truly happy life. Happy people add value to the world and I've realised the best way to help the world, is to help people be happier so they can add their value. A lot of happiness is down to our state of mind, however our state of mind is based on many factors. I wrote 'The Happy Diet' to support the people who don't normally get the support they need and if I have helped you in anyway and you wanted to help me back, this is how you can.</p><p>If you help support this campaign you will not only be helping others by giving them the chance to buy my book, but you will be helping me support my family. Whilst my dreams have always been to help others, I live very close to the poverty line in a small flat with my 4 children who all depend solely on me and currently share one bedroom. I would like the opportunity to get us out of this flat as well as give them all the things they deserve. I have put too much hard work and soul into this book to have it fail now and if you can help support me and this book in anyway, you will be helping to save the world...</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>I need to make £11,000. This money will cover the costs of a hugely successful pr marketing campaign and allow me to print a big run of books to sell after the campaign is successful. I will also be able to continue to improve what I do on Instagram and concentrate on more in-depth videos for YouTube as I'll finally be able to invest in some proper recording equipment.</p><p> </p><h2>Perks</h2><p><strong>£5-£29</strong></p><p><strong>Any contribution made between £5-29 will receive a handwritten card from me and the kids.

At 14 and what is probably the most pivotal age with regards to development, I was sexually assaulted and because of how it happened I felt I had to keep it a secret. I also had never met my biological father and having an absent parent often makes a child feel as though they did something wrong or were not good enough. Team those things together and you had one very hurt, angry and depressed little girl. For years I battled my darkness on my own and it just existed silently in my mind. I am now a mother of 4 amazing children and it was shortly after the birth of my first son (12 years ago) and death of my brother that I finally sought help. I had never touched hard drugs but had always smoked cannabis because it helped to quieten my thoughts. However, it got to a point when it was no longer quietening them and something had to give. So I started to see a drugs counsellor and after seeing him for about 8 months I finally hit rock bottom. Things were so bad, I didn't want to exist anymore and I was on the verge of ending it all. I called my counsellor the day I was going to kill myself and told him I wanted him to help me get care for my son and asked him to call child services. I think he knew what I was going to do and he asked me to go in and see him straight away. That's when he gave me the book that saved my life. He handed me a small book called 'The Secret' and begged me to read it. I went home and that night I sat on the floor of my bedsit kitchen and read the book cover to cover. The book changed EVERYTHING and in 4 hours my life was suddenly very different. I realised that we are the creators of our life and that we are the ones who have control over it. I realised I had caused all my own problems and as hard as that was to swallow, I had finally found hope because I knew that if I had caused it I could just as easily change it. From that moment everything was different. Something just clicked. I knew I couldn't change the past but I felt powerful knowing I could change the future. I had spent so many years being angry and not living that I now wanted to know everything about being happy and living with love and purpose.</p><p>10 years on from being on the most immense personal growth journey, I felt it was time to start helping others by sharing what I had learned. I didn't want the pain I went through to be pointless, I wanted to use my knowledge and experience to help inspire others and give them hope. My book is EVERYTHING I have learnt over the last 10 years that actually keeps you happy and sane. Doctors are very quick to put us on medication that might not be needed if we all had the right tools to begin with. The book is like a giant tool box and even though it's called  'The Happy Diet',  it's about a lot more than just food; it's a way of living that will genuinely help people feel better mentally, physically and spiritually. Eating clean, meditation, yoga, gratitude, social media restrictions and television bans are just some of the wisdom I share in this book. People wonder why it is so cheap but as a single parent who has suffered mentally and never had much money, I know a lot of the people that need my book can't afford it which is why I kept the price low-everyone deserves to be happy regardless of financial status. All I hope is that one day my book will save lives too. </p><p><strong>If you have supported this campaign in any way I want you to know just how much you are going to be helping not only me and my family, but everyone else. Through my own pain I have been given the power to help others, but you are giving me the power to spread my help even further and are allowing me to continue to grow what I love doing and offering me an opportunity to benefit others.

I am a mother to my 4 amazing children and I work from home running my small baby jewellery business, homeschooling my youngest 3 and managing my new venture 'NOT Dr.Tamara'.I have always felt very compelled to help others. The state of the world has always bothered me and since I could think for myself I have had a burning desire to help save the planet. Whilst that may sound crazy, if you know what an empath is you will understand why I am like this. I had never been sure of how I could help save the world, but after launching my alternative health and happiness blog www.notdrtamara.com last year some strange things started happening. I had written a book a couple of years prior to my blog and shortly after the blogs launch, I started editing the book. The first night I sat down to start the edit, I realised I hated everything about the book. It was just so depressing and I didn't like it one bit. I wanted to write something that would actually help people, something that would make a difference, something that would help save the world! That night everything changed. The moon was full and I will never, ever forget that evening or that moon because that was the night I wrote 'The Happy Diet'. Yes, I wrote the book in one night, something even I find hard to believe but since writing it I have realised that the book came from the universe and was just being channeled through me (yes that may seem odd but I can't think of any other explanation!). After some editing, I released 'The Happy Diet' as an eBook. I had no money to print it properly and hadn't even thought of getting it published or an agent. After months of only a few eBook sales and everyone that had purchased it saying they wished it was a 'proper' book I realised I needed to make it into a 'proper' book. So I started the journey to try and get a publisher. As it was not a normal book and only has 40 pages, I was turned down by a few people that said it wasn't long enough and didn't even bother to read it. Something in my head told me that the only way to get this out there was to self publish and so another journey started. Self publishing was no joke. With no money I had to do everything from the edits, to the design of the cover and pages to the actual putting together of the book for print-and everything in between. I have never had any 'seed' money or investments, all the money I have used so far I have made myself either through the jewellery or consulting and this is why it has taken so long. I don't like to label myself as a 'single parent' but raising my children alone has made it harder and I have been forced to make decisions I wasn't too proud of. I always make sure they eat very well and have the clothing they need, but I haven't we haven't had a holiday in 9 years and every time I have any spare money instead of doing something with them I have put the money into the book. It has taken lot of tears, hard decisions and 3am bedtime but I did what I needed to do. This is why I am now asking for help. It is the week before the launch of the book and I have nothing left. I had hoped for a miracle instead of having to find the money for a marketing campaign to help the sales of the book but it hasn't happened. On Thursday night when I realised this book won't sell without some marketing I put it to the universe. The week had been so stressful but knowing how unproductive stress is I knew I had to let it go. So I did and then on Friday morning I woke up to this message from one of my Instagram family:Hi Tamara.  Before I woke this morning a little message came through to say to you to set up a go fund me page to help you achieve all that you want to do. What you do is worth a lot in non monetary terms and people would be happy to donate and help. When I get a message I pass it on. I love what you do. Thanks for everything xxWhilst this was the answer I had prayed for, it wasn't one I was comfortable with. And so another journey began, a journey of accepting that it is okay to ask for help especially if you add value to the world, which I know I do.For the last year I have been trying to grow a community of happy minded people on Instagram in the hope that once happy and inspired, they would go on to help others and bring their own magic to the world. So many beautiful broken people have the potential and passion to be amazing, but they just simply lack the tools they need to move on from a negative past and see how great they are. This is what 'The Happy Diet' is about; giving people the tools they need to live a truly happy life. Happy people add value to the world and I've realised the best way to help the world, is to help people be happier so they can add their value. A lot of happiness is down to our state of mind, however our state of mind is based on many factors. I wrote 'The Happy Diet' to support the people who don't normally get the support they need and if I have helped you in anyway and you wanted to help me back, this is how you can.If you help support this campaign you will not only be helping others by giving them the chance to buy my book, but you will be helping me support my family. Whilst my dreams have always been to help others, I live very close to the poverty line in a small flat with my 4 children who all depend solely on me and currently share one bedroom. I would like the opportunity to get us out of this flat as well as give them all the things they deserve. I have put too much hard work and soul into this book to have it fail now and if you can help support me and this book in anyway, you will be helping to save the world... What I Need & What You GetI need to make £11,000. This money will cover the costs of a hugely successful pr marketing campaign and allow me to print a big run of books to sell after the campaign is successful. I will also be able to continue to improve what I do on Instagram and concentrate on more in-depth videos for YouTube as I'll finally be able to invest in some proper recording equipment. Perks£5-£29Any contribution made between £5-29 will receive a handwritten card from me and the kids.

At 14 and what is probably the most pivotal age with regards to development, I was sexually assaulted and because of how it happened I felt I had to keep it a secret. I also had never met my biological father and having an absent parent often makes a child feel as though they did something wrong or were not good enough. Team those things together and you had one very hurt, angry and depressed little girl. For years I battled my darkness on my own and it just existed silently in my mind. I am now a mother of 4 amazing children and it was shortly after the birth of my first son (12 years ago) and death of my brother that I finally sought help. I had never touched hard drugs but had always smoked cannabis because it helped to quieten my thoughts. However, it got to a point when it was no longer quietening them and something had to give. So I started to see a drugs counsellor and after seeing him for about 8 months I finally hit rock bottom. Things were so bad, I didn't want to exist anymore and I was on the verge of ending it all. I called my counsellor the day I was going to kill myself and told him I wanted him to help me get care for my son and asked him to call child services. I think he knew what I was going to do and he asked me to go in and see him straight away. That's when he gave me the book that saved my life. He handed me a small book called 'The Secret' and begged me to read it. I went home and that night I sat on the floor of my bedsit kitchen and read the book cover to cover. The book changed EVERYTHING and in 4 hours my life was suddenly very different. I realised that we are the creators of our life and that we are the ones who have control over it. I realised I had caused all my own problems and as hard as that was to swallow, I had finally found hope because I knew that if I had caused it I could just as easily change it. From that moment everything was different. Something just clicked. I knew I couldn't change the past but I felt powerful knowing I could change the future. I had spent so many years being angry and not living that I now wanted to know everything about being happy and living with love and purpose.10 years on from being on the most immense personal growth journey, I felt it was time to start helping others by sharing what I had learned. I didn't want the pain I went through to be pointless, I wanted to use my knowledge and experience to help inspire others and give them hope. My book is EVERYTHING I have learnt over the last 10 years that actually keeps you happy and sane. Doctors are very quick to put us on medication that might not be needed if we all had the right tools to begin with. The book is like a giant tool box and even though it's called  'The Happy Diet',  it's about a lot more than just food; it's a way of living that will genuinely help people feel better mentally, physically and spiritually. Eating clean, meditation, yoga, gratitude, social media restrictions and television bans are just some of the wisdom I share in this book. People wonder why it is so cheap but as a single parent who has suffered mentally and never had much money, I know a lot of the people that need my book can't afford it which is why I kept the price low-everyone deserves to be happy regardless of financial status. All I hope is that one day my book will save lives too. If you have supported this campaign in any way I want you to know just how much you are going to be helping not only me and my family, but everyone else.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My story began 20 years ago.  I was a special education teacher working with elementary students that were diagnosed with learning disabilities and emotional problems. Similar to my background, these children came from single parent homes and grew up in economically depressed areas.  I can remember how hard these parents worked and how they looked to professionals, like teachers and doctors, to help raise healthy families. Unfortunately, medication was often seen as the answer.</p>
<p>In the late 90's I was fortunate to learn about a hospital that offered alternative and complimentary therapies to children with special needs - an innovative practice that was clearly ahead of its time.<strong>  </strong></p>
<p><strong>It was then that my dream to introduce communities to holistic wellness was born.</strong></p>
<p>I began a journey which increased my business knowledge while exploring the benefits of holistic wellness in my own life.  Among the therapies I've experienced are acupuncture, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, chiropractic, food cleanses, Craniosacral therapy, crystal healing, massage, meditation, reflexology, Rolfing, Shiatsu, holistic vision therapy, sound therapy and various forms of yoga.  I also learned to appreciate the principles of Feng Shui (harmonizing your inner world with your outer environment).</p>
<p>In 2012, I was blessed to connect with the healing energy of Reiki and its intuitive nature. I studied to become a level 2 Reiki Practitioner while working at Boston Children's Hospital.  Reiki is a hands-on, light or soft touch technique which channels the universal life force energy (energy found in all living things) to help restore energetic balance within our own bodies.  It releases tension or stress, produces deep relaxation/calm and can even provide an energy boost if needed. Reiki activates our body's natural healing process. </p>
<p><strong>After 5 years of working with R<strong>eiki energy, I've realized that Reiki is </strong>the first step toward opening a holistic wellness center for families particularly those with children that have special needs.</strong></p>
<p>I've been very fortunate to have patients, friends and family that have experienced Reiki through me.  I would love to share this gift with you all!  </p>

<p>To start on a successful path I have been working with mentors at SCORE, seeking the advice of friends who have expertise in marketing, finance, holistic wellness and entrepreneurship, taking Reiki-related business courses, as well as, collaborating with other Reiki Practitioners in Massachusetts.  My educational background includes a Masters in Special Education, a Masters in Business Administration, a Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Reiki Level 2 Certification.</p>
<p>I plan to open my office in the Greater Boston area mid-August with a focus on families (children/siblings/parents) and children with special needs.  Currently, there are few practitioners in Boston that specialize in working with these populations. </p>

This is no small task and we need your support!</p><p><b>Why we need your Support...</b></p><p>It is time for us to scale and expand this brand to a level where anyone who wants to experience Manaòs is able to. Our commitment to quality ingredients and botanical wisdom is too BIG to play small. We are here to serve the collective well-being and we want to expand to meet the needs of our customers and communities.</p><p>The demand for our products is currently greater than the supply we can produce from our home kitchen. After selling over one-thousand units of our top 3 products, many of the initial hurdles in product development and formulation have been addressed during the past 3 years</p><p><strong>Imagine A World…</strong></p><p>That loves itself from the inside out. A place where people love their skin and bodies with equal gratitude as the earth they walk on. Where learning opportunities and sacred rituals are shared in abundance, encouraging a synergistic relationship with plants &amp; a deeper practice of self-love…</p><p><strong>Aychele’s Inspiration...</strong></p><p>Upon moving to Montreal from Brazil, Aychele continued her work as a massage therapist where she encountered many patients with similar skin challenges as herself. It wasn’t long before she began to craft her own remedies to share in 2014. As the positive feedback grew… she knew she was on to something.</p><p>This spark of inspiration ignited an insatiable curiosity for plant knowledge that sent Aychele on a  quest to source superior ingredients. Aychele trained with the world’s top herbalists, researching botanicals rich in phyto-nutrients that retained maximum moisture for their own survival... thereby benefitting our skin immensly.</p><p><strong>Back to the Amazon...</strong></p><p>As she immersed herself deeper in the wisdom of plants, a divine synchronicity would bring her full circle… back to her Brazilian roots… back to the forest of her childhood dreams… back to the Amazon. A place where she uncovered the truth she was seeking… a truth about the connection between humans and plants.</p><p>As a tribute to an ancient tribe of the forest… Manaòs Beauty was born. A few years later, in 2017, Aychele married Alexander Hill and Manaòs Beauty was brought to the United States.</p><p><u><strong>OUR PLAN:</strong></u></p><p><strong>In 2 months</strong>... we will grow our team, move production outside of our home, and fine-tune our packaging.</p><ul>
<li>Once our first employee is trained, we will seek a small commercial facility to produce and bottle the ingredients of our formulas. We will begin using a drop-shipping service to maximize order fulfillment &amp; efficiency. </li>
<li>Drawing on Alexander’s experience in commercial real estate, we intend to find an ideal location at an affordable rent here in California.</li>
<li>We will upgrade our packaging, bottles, printing, and labeling to meet all standards for UPC barcode,  govt. regulations, &amp; retail requirements to be carried in larger stores and online.</li>
</ul><p><strong>In 3 months…</strong> as production increases at our facility, we will continually expand to more retail stores &amp; yoga studios. We will also begin to train independent distributors to give workshops and carry our products.</p><ul><li>We will expand our retail partnerships from 6 stores (at present) to 30+ retail stores &amp; yoga studios on the East &amp; West Coast. Predominantly located in New York &amp; California. </li></ul><p><strong>In 4-5 months</strong>...  Production is dialed-in to handle more orders, We will re-invest 25% of existing profits in online marketing and advertising campaigns to increase our online sales.</p><ul><li>We will continue promoting brand awareness with courses, webinars, and marketing strategies to drive traffic to our website with SEO, Facebook, Google, Youtube &amp; Instagram.</li></ul><p><strong>6 Months and Beyond..</strong> Our team will continue with community outreach at yoga studios &amp; stores to promote skin care rituals of self-love and the overall mission of Manaòs as a company. We will host retreats alongside the <a href=""http://ttps://www.theboafoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BOA Foundation</a> in the Amazon to visit the tribes we support... while sharing our journey with you! At this point, we will be able to establish a long-term plan of monetary contribution to the tribes we are working with.</p><p><strong>2019 Revenue Goal</strong>- $500,000+ in Net Profit. Making our first year-end contribution to the <a href=""https://www.theboafoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BOA Foundation</a> for the Tribes of the Amazon Basin.</p><p><strong>2020 Revenue Goal</strong>- $1M+ in Net Profit.</p><p><strong>2021 and Beyond...</strong> Establishing ourselves as a successful startup story in the world of natural skincare. We will inspire more companies to grow and prosper with similar ethical models. We envision sharing our story at festivals, events, via online platforms, &amp; podcasts. Our long term projects will include buying land to harvest the ingredients we use and to restore as much rainforest as possible in the process.</p><p><u>Any amount of funds raised by this campaign will go into expanding production capabilities of this company… No matter what the final amount raised, we are committed to growing this company because we are deeply passionate about this project and the mission. We are committed to offering our gifts in a way to contribute for a world where we can live in harmony with nature.</u></p><p><strong>Staying Involved</strong></p><p>As part of our community outreach program, we aim to offer workshops for all ages where we have fun and nourish our skin and bodies with gifts of nature… offering lessons from the natural world about our own anatomy and practical plant wisdom… with the ultimate goal for all to experience, feel, listen, and grow in understanding plants… to learn from their wisdom and find where the true beauty lies within…</p><p><strong>Some Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>One occasional obstacle at Manaòs Beauty is product cost, due to our unwavering commitment to sourcing the highest quality ingredients from the Amazon and and other parts of the world. In an effort to make this business viable, buying our containers, packaging and ingredients in bulk is the best way to keep costs consistently low.</p><p>Another risk we may face is the increase in essential oil prices and seasonal availability for the ingredients we use. We have not had to deal with any setbacks related to this yet, but as we grow in sales and numbers, we perceive availability on certain rare ingredients as a possible challenge for us. However, like every smart business out there, we will come up with solutions that adapt to these challenges.</p><p>This being said… If there is a natural disaster to any region of our suppliers, we have a few backup sources where we can source ingredients. We can always pivot and get creative to tweak our formulas based on what’s available, what's in season, and what's abundant in nature during the time of production. </p><p><strong>We Grow with Our Customers </strong></p><p>As we gather more customer feedback. Aychele will be able to formulate new types of botanical scents and skin care products based on consumer demand and market trends.</p><p>One of these potential products has been the idea of a specific tattoo balm… which many of our customers mentioned to us after using Bonita Cream during their tattoo recovery days. While never intending to service this niche, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive from several of our tattoed friends. Thanks guys! We can't wait to come up with something soon for you.</p><p>If you're inspired by our story and mission, please share our campaign with someone you love by e-mail, social media, or text!</p><p><strong>Testimonials:</strong></p><p>""These products have changed my skin and helped to connect me with the medicine of pure plant power.  After a year of using Manaòs Beauty products, I am no longer prone to weird breakouts, and have a new glow"". </p><p>- Kai A.

Our commitment to quality ingredients and botanical wisdom is too BIG to play small. We are here to serve the collective well-being and we want to expand to meet the needs of our customers and communities.The demand for our products is currently greater than the supply we can produce from our home kitchen. After selling over one-thousand units of our top 3 products, many of the initial hurdles in product development and formulation have been addressed during the past 3 yearsImagine A World…That loves itself from the inside out. A place where people love their skin and bodies with equal gratitude as the earth they walk on. Where learning opportunities and sacred rituals are shared in abundance, encouraging a synergistic relationship with plants & a deeper practice of self-love…Aychele’s Inspiration...Upon moving to Montreal from Brazil, Aychele continued her work as a massage therapist where she encountered many patients with similar skin challenges as herself. It wasn’t long before she began to craft her own remedies to share in 2014. As the positive feedback grew… she knew she was on to something.This spark of inspiration ignited an insatiable curiosity for plant knowledge that sent Aychele on a  quest to source superior ingredients. Aychele trained with the world’s top herbalists, researching botanicals rich in phyto-nutrients that retained maximum moisture for their own survival... thereby benefitting our skin immensly.Back to the Amazon...As she immersed herself deeper in the wisdom of plants, a divine synchronicity would bring her full circle… back to her Brazilian roots… back to the forest of her childhood dreams… back to the Amazon. A place where she uncovered the truth she was seeking… a truth about the connection between humans and plants.As a tribute to an ancient tribe of the forest… Manaòs Beauty was born. A few years later, in 2017, Aychele married Alexander Hill and Manaòs Beauty was brought to the United States.OUR PLAN:In 2 months... we will grow our team, move production outside of our home, and fine-tune our packaging.
Once our first employee is trained, we will seek a small commercial facility to produce and bottle the ingredients of our formulas. We will begin using a drop-shipping service to maximize order fulfillment & efficiency. 
Drawing on Alexander’s experience in commercial real estate, we intend to find an ideal location at an affordable rent here in California.
We will upgrade our packaging, bottles, printing, and labeling to meet all standards for UPC barcode,  govt. regulations, & retail requirements to be carried in larger stores and online.
In 3 months… as production increases at our facility, we will continually expand to more retail stores & yoga studios. We will also begin to train independent distributors to give workshops and carry our products.We will expand our retail partnerships from 6 stores (at present) to 30+ retail stores & yoga studios on the East & West Coast. Predominantly located in New York & California. In 4-5 months...  Production is dialed-in to handle more orders, We will re-invest 25% of existing profits in online marketing and advertising campaigns to increase our online sales.We will continue promoting brand awareness with courses, webinars, and marketing strategies to drive traffic to our website with SEO, Facebook, Google, Youtube & Instagram.6 Months and Beyond.. Our team will continue with community outreach at yoga studios & stores to promote skin care rituals of self-love and the overall mission of Manaòs as a company. We will host retreats alongside the BOA Foundation in the Amazon to visit the tribes we support... while sharing our journey with you! At this point, we will be able to establish a long-term plan of monetary contribution to the tribes we are working with.2019 Revenue Goal- $500,000+ in Net Profit. Making our first year-end contribution to the BOA Foundation for the Tribes of the Amazon Basin.2020 Revenue Goal- $1M+ in Net Profit.2021 and Beyond... Establishing ourselves as a successful startup story in the world of natural skincare. We will inspire more companies to grow and prosper with similar ethical models. We envision sharing our story at festivals, events, via online platforms, & podcasts. Our long term projects will include buying land to harvest the ingredients we use and to restore as much rainforest as possible in the process.Any amount of funds raised by this campaign will go into expanding production capabilities of this company… No matter what the final amount raised, we are committed to growing this company because we are deeply passionate about this project and the mission. We are committed to offering our gifts in a way to contribute for a world where we can live in harmony with nature.Staying InvolvedAs part of our community outreach program, we aim to offer workshops for all ages where we have fun and nourish our skin and bodies with gifts of nature… offering lessons from the natural world about our own anatomy and practical plant wisdom… with the ultimate goal for all to experience, feel, listen, and grow in understanding plants… to learn from their wisdom and find where the true beauty lies within…Some Risks & ChallengesOne occasional obstacle at Manaòs Beauty is product cost, due to our unwavering commitment to sourcing the highest quality ingredients from the Amazon and and other parts of the world. In an effort to make this business viable, buying our containers, packaging and ingredients in bulk is the best way to keep costs consistently low.Another risk we may face is the increase in essential oil prices and seasonal availability for the ingredients we use. We have not had to deal with any setbacks related to this yet, but as we grow in sales and numbers, we perceive availability on certain rare ingredients as a possible challenge for us. However, like every smart business out there, we will come up with solutions that adapt to these challenges.This being said… If there is a natural disaster to any region of our suppliers, we have a few backup sources where we can source ingredients. We can always pivot and get creative to tweak our formulas based on what’s available, what's in season, and what's abundant in nature during the time of production. We Grow with Our Customers As we gather more customer feedback. Aychele will be able to formulate new types of botanical scents and skin care products based on consumer demand and market trends.One of these potential products has been the idea of a specific tattoo balm… which many of our customers mentioned to us after using Bonita Cream during their tattoo recovery days. While never intending to service this niche, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive from several of our tattoed friends. Thanks guys! We can't wait to come up with something soon for you.If you're inspired by our story and mission, please share our campaign with someone you love by e-mail, social media, or text!Testimonials:""These products have changed my skin and helped to connect me with the medicine of pure plant power.  After a year of using Manaòs Beauty products, I am no longer prone to weird breakouts, and have a new glow"". - Kai A.

In just three days, it's already completely changed my skin. It hasn't been this clear in a couple years now since I stopped using chemical prescriptions. This Ambrosia Serum is made from fruits of the Amazon by a Brazilian goddess! I have tried so many things but this is literally miraculous.

<h3>PRANA SALT CAVE and Wellness Center</h3>
<p>My name is Liana Belanich and I am trying to bring the first dry salt therapy to Wilmington! I have UNCW Business Management degree, a 200hr Kunga Yoga and Lifestyle certification and an obsessive passion for helping others learn about health and mindfulness so that we can all live our best lives physically and emotionally. Over the years I have learned about many holistic modalities and want to share them all with you! </p>
<p>Many of us suffer from physical illnesses, drug addiction, depression, anxiety, weight loss and more. For each of us the journey to health and happiness can be completely different. The transformation starts from within, learning how to love and have compassion for ourselves and others, but there are also many tools that can help us along the way. It is a life long practice of learning and making choices. Prana Salt Cave and Wellness may be able to support you where you are at on the journey by providing dry salt therapy, workshops on nutrition, breathing, compassion, and energy, classes for yoga, meditation, ecstatic dance, and movement, and events for connection and peace like kirtan and sound baths within the cave!</p>
<p>It is important for me to be of service to others. I have found love and peace in my own life after being in a dark place and want others to be able to do the same. Let us all come together to make this dream come to life so that we can all begin to shine a little brighter each day, to be our best selves and create a beautiful community together! </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS DRY SALT THERAPY?</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout history salt has been used in many ways to optimize our health. Salt is essential for nerve and muscle function and regulating our blood PH and pressure. Dry salt therapy, also known as halotherapy, is a holistic, natural, drug free therapy used to help with respiratory issues, skin conditions, sleep, relaxation, anxiety, detoxification, physical fitness and endurance! </p>

<p>In the 300sqft salt cave (room) you will be surrounded by salt on the floors, on the walls and then micro salt particles will be pumped through the air from a halogenerator. You will sit for a 45 or 20 minute session in our gravity free chairs and sit back with a blanket and eye pillow if you like, rest, or maybe even take a nap! The room will be 71degrees and at a humidity between 30-55% ensuring the best environment for your respiratory health and to maintain the negatively charged ions from the salt. This can help to neutralize the atmosphere helping to destress, ground and stabilize our mood.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533184171/rxtxrpji7wecefocb2ay.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need to acquire more funding, be it through donation, investments or taking advantage of our awesome promotions! Be the first to be a part of Prana Salt Cave and Wellness Center!</p>
<p>So far I have raised $73,000 by talking to family and friends! It is time to broaden my reach and connect with all of you! We need to raise AT LEAST $67,000 more! Yes, this may sound like a lot but I know that through this campaign, events, product sales, networking and meetings with private investors I will be able to find the help we need! </p>
<p>What is the funding for?</p>
<ul>
<li>$84,000 for the buildout of the space, electrician, architect, contractor</li>
<li>$43,000 for the tons of Himalayan Salt and equipment</li>
<li>$13,000 for inventory, space deposit, signage, legal fees</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Prana Salt Cave will have a big impact on our community. We will provide quality services that no one else in town has yet and we will create a safe space for love, healing and connection. Not only will we help you to optimize your own well-being we will also GIVE BACK to the community!</p>
<ul>
<li>We will offer FREE sessions to those in need with respiratory issues such as Cystic fibrosis and COPD </li>
<li>We will have some donation based yoga, meditation and nutrition classes</li>
<li>We will host events for organizations </li>
<li>AND a % of our proceeds will go to local non-profit organizations such as Yoga Village and The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation of the Carolinas</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating a business can be a rollercoaster! I have already faced some obstacles but continue to make moves each day! Funding is our biggest issue at the moment, I was close a few times to having all the funding but as a startup company the banks are very conservative. </p>
<p>The other issue we may run into is deciding on the right space. I have two options in mind but there is the possibility that someone else could rent them before I can have enough funding to sign a lease. </p>
<p>Another challenge is the amount of time it takes for permitting and building. We are hoping the process will only take 3/4 months but you just never know! Please be patient and kind to us along this journey! I will share updates and progress along the way!</p>

<h3>Introduction </h3>
<p>Wildish Botanicals is a cooperatively owned herb shop in the heart of SE Portland. We are establishing a network of natural medicine that connects local herb growers, teachers, health practitioners, herbs and supplies with the entire community to make natural medicine accessible and affordable. We aim to be a model for how local communities can work together to take their health into their own hands.</p>
<p>Here’s how we’ll do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Local Only.</strong> We only stock organic herbs that have been grown by local farmers. We're talking within 300 miles! This supports local economy, reduces shipping/packaging, and connects us with the nature that surrounds us.</li>
<li>
<strong>Space. </strong>We’re tearing down walls (in more than one way!), to open our space for more classes and workshops. This helps teachers and health practitioners empower the community with the education we need to heal ourselves.</li>
<li>
<strong>Memberships. </strong>Our Lifetime Co-op Memberships are only $100! Did we mention it’s for your entire life? This gives discounts of 15% off on bulk herbs, teas, and tinctures; as well as 20% off classes and workshops. To make our memberships accessible, a $25 deposit will start your savings instantly. We will also be giving membership scholarships to those in real need.</li>
<li>
<strong>Donation-only clinics.</strong> Once a month we will be hosting donation-only clinics where people in need can receive care, regardless of economic status.</li>
<li>
<strong>Charity.</strong> A percentage of select product sales goes toward local nonprofits who empower our community. For example, pet product sales support rescue shelters; and children’s health products goes toward breaking generational poverty.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise $28,500 in 30 days to build our space. The funds will go toward building community workshop tables, shelving for products, and our first purchases of locally grown herbs and botanical supplies.</p>
<p>We are very grateful to our open-hearted community who have been volunteering their time and labor. With their hands-on help, we will be able to do all the construction ourselves!</p>
<p>Our perk packages are geared toward getting our backers involved and rewarded. Selecting our membership enrollment will start your savings the day of our Grand Opening in December 2018. There will be raffle giveaways, herbal consultations, custom formulas, guided herb walks, and more!</p>
<p>The new wave of healthcare is using natural remedies to heal yourself and your loved ones. It’s time to reconnect with our Wildish roots and take our health back into our own hands. Your contribution will play an essential role in creating a central hub of natural medicine for our community. Every donation makes a difference, thank you for joining the Wildish movement!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Team</h3>
<p>Paul, Daniel, Vicky, Kassaundra, and Melissa all have various backgrounds in botanical medicine. With our powers combined, we have a diverse and complementary set of skills to weave a tight web of interconnection that will benefit our entire community.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT WE DO- The women's preventative care battle</h3>
<p>The Women's Ovarian &amp; Medical Education Network is  dedicated to alleviating the fertility risks faced by women through education, advocacy, and research. By serving as the voice to end the silence on the common conditions that lead to impaired fertility, advocating for equitable healthcare on a local and statewide level, and mobilizing around access to preventative care, we can increase healthcare equity and decrease infertility in women.</p>
<p>Since 2016 we have been working directly with women and sadly, we see that even after informing women on how to identify the <strong><i>silent signs and symptoms</i></strong> of early infertility conditions or gynecologic cancers, the battle for PREVENTATIVE CARE is still present. We have received endless calls and emails of women sharing their own stories of discovering late stage cancer, or being rushed to the emergency room for a growing tumor they were never aware of, despite multiple doctors visits. <i><strong>This crisis will continue unless women have access to preventative care ultrasounds which are not considered standard care by the insurance industry.</strong></i></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">W.O.M.E.N. Inc on the National Stage</h3>
<p>The CEO and founder of the Women’s Ovarian &amp; Medical Education Network knew that it would take a unique path to get women’s fertility health in the headlines. In 2017 she decided to do whatever it would take, even if that meant sharing her own fertility health story and running for Mrs. California. Upon winning the crown of <strong>Mrs. California </strong>and continuing on to the National <strong>Mrs. America Pageant</strong>, the message of women's preventative care and the mission of W.O.M.E.N. Inc swept across the state and was covered by <strong>CBS News</strong>.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Women’s health is more important than corporate wealth!</strong></h3>
<p>Insurance companies refuse to include ultrasounds in a woman’s “annual exam”. </p>
<p>Even worse, women are being told to wait 3 to 5 years for a pap smear.</p>
<p>Women need a place where they can get an ultrasound without dropping $300-$500 just to make sure they’re healthy!</p>
<p>Nationally, the United States is not investing in fertility related preventative care, rather reactive treatment-- which is why IVF treatment and egg counting is becoming a popular topic.</p>
<p>One ultrasound can prevent the need for women to ever need to seek IVF; However, that means certain industries will lose millions of dollars. </p>
<p><strong>Our mobile unit will provide free preventative care ultrasounds and one on one consultations to women with INSTANT answers and next steps for care. The unit will visit prime locations for women at risk: college campuses, businesses, city center, and other locations in which women between 20 and 40 years old have an active presence, but girls and women of all ages can and will be served by W.O.M.E.N. Inc.</strong></p>

<p>One (1) Series 4000WB-38 Mobile Ultrasound Clinic...............$264,295.00</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo Project funding goal is based on the initial cost for the mobile ultrasound clinic, but our additional operating costs needed to bring this life changing care to women are $225,000 for  a total of $475,000.</p>
<p><strong>If our project meets our minimum fundraising goal listed, we will continue our local efforts to fundraise the remaining difference in order to bring this project to fruition. In showing our private funders YOUR nation wide support and belief in the urgency of women's preventative fertility care, our goal is to raise the additional capital by December 31, 2019. Construction of the mobile ultrasound unit will begin upon raising 80% of our overall goal and is estimated to take 6 months for full construction.</strong></p>

Even worse, women are being told to wait 3 to 5 years for a pap smear.
Women need a place where they can get an ultrasound without dropping $300-$500 just to make sure they’re healthy!
Nationally, the United States is not investing in fertility related preventative care, rather reactive treatment-- which is why IVF treatment and egg counting is becoming a popular topic.
One ultrasound can prevent the need for women to ever need to seek IVF; However, that means certain industries will lose millions of dollars. 
Our mobile unit will provide free preventative care ultrasounds and one on one consultations to women with INSTANT answers and next steps for care. The unit will visit prime locations for women at risk: college campuses, businesses, city center, and other locations in which women between 20 and 40 years old have an active presence, but girls and women of all ages can and will be served by W.O.M.E.N. Inc.


OUR CROWDFUNDING GOAL
One (1) Series 4000WB-38 Mobile Ultrasound Clinic...............$264,295.00
Our Indiegogo Project funding goal is based on the initial cost for the mobile ultrasound clinic, but our additional operating costs needed to bring this life changing care to women are $225,000 for  a total of $475,000.
If our project meets our minimum fundraising goal listed, we will continue our local efforts to fundraise the remaining difference in order to bring this project to fruition. In showing our private funders YOUR nation wide support and belief in the urgency of women's preventative fertility care, our goal is to raise the additional capital by December 31, 2019. Construction of the mobile ultrasound unit will begin upon raising 80% of our overall goal and is estimated to take 6 months for full construction.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hello dream catchers! I'm Dellasie; a philanthropist, public speaker, CEO and recording artist. I started my philanthropy career 5 years ago after being invited to some schools to speak to children about my career. Being able to touch those kids was so inspiring to me.  I was also deeply inspired by my late uncle KOFI ANNAN. I wanted to do more than entertain and touch people with my music/performances. I wanted to make a real difference in the world like he did, so I asked him for advice. He said, ""Go home and think of what makes you upset. Use that energy to fuel your drive for change'. A brilliant and unorthodox method. That is precisely what I did lol! I thought about colorism in the entertainment industry and throughout the world. I thought about the psychological, historical and health implications of this phenomenon. I realized this was a huge contributing factor to skin cancer trends in communities of color... I was inspired to make a change. </li>
<li>This issue is so important to me because my aunt passed from melanoma when I was 11 years old. I have seen the adverse effects of skin bleaching on so many. Cancer is so pervasive; both my parents are cancer survivors. My life has been deeply touched by various types of cancer, but skin cancer due to bleaching was something that really touched me. I am a darkskin woman who understand first-hand the effects of colorism on one's psyche and confidence. My anti-bleaching skin cancer initiative was thus born. I started doing research and I put together a comprehensive proposal. I started getting invited to platforms to speak on this issue (such as: the United Nations, Washington University, Georgetown University, Microsoft Headquarters, etc).</li>
<li>Investing in this endeavor will mean that you will play an integral part to effecting change in an area that is severely under-reported, under-represented, and under-researched. Your funding will help me conduct critical research, visit areas where access to important medical care is limited, conduct powerful and inspiring speeches for young people around the country, continent and diaspora, and change lives. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breaking it down in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am requesting $10,000 which will fund my work over the next 6 months to a year. That price includes the cost of travel (airplane and car depending on location), the registration fees for the conferences and congresses I have been invited to speak on, the marketing and filming fees for the work I'm doing to keep a digital diary of my progress, and the various logistical costs for the education/media tour I plan to launch in 2022. </li>
<li>Perks include access to a private digital diary of behind the scenes personal footage and exclusive information in terms of the progress of this initiative. </li>
<li>If I do not reach my entire goal, whatever funding I do receive will go towards registering for as many conferences as I can. My hope is that through my passionate and engaging speeches, I will inspire some medical professionals in the field to join this initiative and assist with their resources and their access. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>This project is valuable to the world because it doesn't just effect Black people, it effects every single person of color on earth. Skin cancer is pervasive and actually effects all communities (including Europeans) -- but colorism directly effects those of color. I think it's important to show the world that all colors and shades of people are beautiful. Diversity is beautiful, and it's what makes humankind so amazing. With your help, we can spread this message to everyone who needs to hear it. There are so many medical implications of this practice, and millions of those who bleach their skin do not realize how dangerous this practice is. The goal is to prevent this very serious issue from becoming an epidemic. We can be a part of the solution before things escalate to dangerously deadly. levels. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>A big risk in this work that I am very aware of is my safety. Skin bleaching is a billion dollar business, and many multinational corporations have made huge profits off of this practice. The work I'm doing definitely poses a threat to their capital. Many of the dignitaries and professionals in the field I have discussed my work with have warned me to be careful and work trepidatiously to reduce the risk to my safety. Another challenge is the lack of dermatologists on the continent to care for those that are at risk. There are millions of people per 1 dermatologist in sub-Saharan Africa. In the West, there are about 1,200 people for every dermatologist. These numbers are staggering. </li>
<li>In Angola, the government has subsidized education in dermatology for their youth. They give grants to young students to obtain dermatology degrees. I think this is a great initiative that should be adopted by other nations around Africa. I would like to appeal to some of the government representatives and see how we may initiate these kinds of incentives for the youth. As far as my safety, I plan to be as careful and vigilant as possible. But I do understand that this is a risk I am willing to take. This cause is very important and it needs the world's attention. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Not everyone has the capital to donate funding, and that I do understand. You can help by sharing this campaign to your following; looking at dermatologists in your area, and appealing to them by sending them this information -- or even providing any information you may have that subsidizes travel fees for a philanthropist in the field like me. </li>
<li>You can also use the various Indiegogo share tools! That would be deeply appreciated. </li>

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why Celebrant School?</span></h2>
<p>I feel like the roads of my life have been leading towards this career path.  Several years ago two of my friends asked me to solemnize (aka be the officiant) at their wedding. They thought I would be good at something like that. I considered it and thought, yes, I would like to try that, and I would love to give that gift to my friends.</p>
<p>And then another couple asked me to officiate, and then another.  Each time I performed a ceremony I applied to be a one-day solemnizer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Each ceremony was different and special. I customized each ceremony to the couple and what they wanted, adding what I learned each time to the next one. One fun thing that each couple had in common was the fact that I met them all through flying trapeze, as at least one member of each couple was a fellow instructor, like myself.  </p>
<p>I'll be preparing another union ceremony, this time for a friend that I met through martial arts.  </p>
<p>Creating these ceremonies of love with each of them involves a number of skills I have:  </p>
<ul>
<li>My performance skills certainly come in handy, as ritual is a bit of a performance. The ability to feel comfortable speaking and projecting in front of a group of people is definitely important.</li>
<li>I have a great interest in ritual, and especially in creating ceremonies that reach beyond traditional religion. I myself am not a religious person, though I consider myself a spiritual person. And there are growing number of people who do not subscribe to a religion, but still are looking for someone to help facilitate rituals to help mark the milestones of their lives.  My Master's Thesis involved a performance project that included a humorous theatrical look at ritual and its companion paper explored the connections between play, ritual, humor, and healing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences and skills, plus conversations I have had with fellow members of the hospital clowning group of which I am a professional member of, encouraged me to seek out more education in this field and to become a Celebrant.  I found The Celebrant Institute, based out of New Jersey, applied, and was accepted.  I am interested in starting my training in January of 2017.  And that's where you come in...</p>
<h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
</div><div><ul>
<li><p>The initial tuition for The Celebrant Institute is $2500.  It is based on Montclair, NJ but I plan to do their online training. This training includes learning the fundamentals of celebrancy, becoming well-versed in wedding celebrancy in particular, and becoming a Certified Celebrant. In the future, if I want to continue my training (and I am interested in doing so) each future specialization is $1100 - these specializations include funerals/celebrations of life, LGBTQ-specific ceremonies, ceremonies for healing, and more. But I would like to finish the initial training, which is 7 months long, and begin practicing and growing this new career path first.</p></li>
<li>In exchange for your support, I have a few different perks to offer you<ul>
<li>For $500 I will work with you to create a ceremony, as we see fit.  This is available to folks in Massachusetts, or possibly elsewhere depending on a variety of factors. Please ask questions if you think this might be right for you! You will also have access to a digital copy of the online reflection journal I will keep during my studies.</li>
<li>For $250 I'll combine my skills as a personal trainer with my love of ritual and create a 90-minute workout just for you and  up to 10 of your friends. I did this for my 40th birthday and then a few months later for my friend's 40th birthday and it was a blast!  This is available to folks living in Massachusetts, but possibly elsewhere depending on a variety of factors.

If I don't reach my goal I will supplement the difference with as much funding as I can out-of-pocket or I will ask to postpone my start date, if possible.  
If illness or another life event creates a situation by which I cannot participate in these studies, I will either postpone my training or seek another method of training (there are other programs of this nature).


Other Ways You Can Help

Please spread the word - Facebook, your website, person-to-person, via email.
Even if you cannot contribute monetarily at this time, word-of-mouth has gone a long way in my previous campaigns and I expect this one to be the same.

Thank you for supporting this project. I'm so excited for this adventure!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Supporting the immune system involves a health-promoting lifestyle, stress management, regular body movement, a healthy vegan lifestyle and the appropriate use of nutritional supplements and herbal medicines.If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, it is a sign that your immune system needs support:Do you catch colds easily?Do you get more than two colds a year?Are you suffering chronic infection?Do you get frequent cold sores or have genital herpes?Are your lymph glands sore and swollen at times?Do you have now or have you ever had cancer?Recurrent or chronic infections-even very mild colds-only occur when the immune system is weakened. Under such circumstances, there is a repetitive cycle that makes it difficult to overcome the tendency toward infection: a weakened immune system leads to infection, infection causes damage to the immune system, which further weakens resistance. Enhancing the immune system can provide the answer to breaking the cycle. What causes low immune function?The health of the immune system is greatly impacted by a person’s emotional state, level of stress, lifestyle, dietary habits and nutritional status. Nutrient deficiency is the most frequent cause of a depressed immune system. An overwhelming number of clinical and experimental studies indicate that any single nutrient deficiency can profoundly impair the immune system.We are so grateful to you and your support ~Living AkashiBy supporting this project you will co create a sacred space that offers health education, self empowerment, body purification and healing to people who have experienced a compromised immune system due to multiple circumstances and various diagnosis of the mind, body and spirit who are seeking a holistic and effective approach to their situation.",15.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>So you want to hear our story... here it is</h3>
<p>Comfort Farms: The Movie is a documentary film about one of the most interesting veteran run therapy programs in the country. Comfort Farms” will explore the struggles of veterans and the journey to make Comfort Farms a reality as a healing and therapeutic place for veterans to manage the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a new and innovative approach called Agro Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</p>
<p>Our approach for managing trauma can revolutionize the way trauma patients are cared for around the world. We have received so many emails, PMs, phone calls and invitations to speak concerning our program, that we decided to create a film that tells the story of how Comfort Farms came to be, the problems we face, and the solutions we provide. </p>
<p>Carlisle Kellam will direct and shoot a short dramatic documentary film (produced by Dee Thompson and Carlisle Kellam) about Comfort Farms in Milledgeville Georgia—focusing on the struggles of combat veterans and founder/visionary Jon Jackson, a man who is committed to seeking healing for himself and others.</p>
<p>Interviews with veterans, people in the community, therapists, volunteers, farmers, and chefs will show how far Comfort Farms has come in just over 2 years of existence. Also explored will be the idea of the farm as a non-profit seeking to be partially self-sustaining, through sales of all natural produce and meats. It will also show how Comfort Farm's mission is to create a coalition of small family farms across Georgia to serve the community and restaurants seeking local and sustainable products managed by veterans who have been helped by the program. The film will be shown at film festivals and possibly distributed for broadcast.</p>

<h3>Schools Need to be Safe in Order to Reopen</h3>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, while there is hope as the new vaccine rollouts continue, there is still a level of uncertainty as to when it will be safe for people to resume their daily lives, including children and teachers returning back to school. Vaccine distribution is taking some time, and it is uncertain when all demographic groups will be protected. So, how do schools consider safely reopening until widespread vaccines are available, and, how do we continue to keep them safe once the vaccine has been widely distributed?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>COVID-19 Testing: Current and Future Needs</h3>
<p>While the historical reach and spread of the coronavirus is still relatively unknown, mass testing efforts for active infection, as well as antibody testing, continue to be conducted in an effort to fight the pandemic and save lives. Testing today versus one or more years from now will fall into two main categories: active infection and antibody testing.</p>
<p><u>Active Infection</u></p>
<p>Currently, for those that are experiencing symptoms and/or have been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19, point-of-care active infection testing provides information on whether someone has contracted the virus. As vaccines are rolled out, active infection testing will still be needed when someone begins to show symptoms of a flu-like virus.</p>
<p><u>Antibody Testing</u></p>
<p>Antibody testing for COVID-19 can help in a number of ways. Since antibodies remain in the bloodstream long after the infection has cleared, antibody testing provides the history of whether someone had the virus. For schools, this helps primarily by providing data on how widely the virus has historically circulated amongst children and staff.  This data in turn informs the school if it has previously experienced a particularly high risk or not and needs to be extra-cautious or can relax rules. Antibody testing can also be used as a low-cost alternative to active infection testing for those teachers and students who have recovered from the virus.</p>
<p><u>The Vaccine and Antibody Testing's Role</u></p>
<p>As vaccines are rolled out, antibody tests, such as ours, will help ascertain that the vaccine has worked properly and that vaccinated individuals have developed antibodies and are protected. While there is still uncertainty around how long antibodies from the vaccine last, antibody testing will also play a roll in monitoring how long antibodies last created in response from the vaccine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>DDTD and Donated Antibody Testing to Schools</h3>
<p><u>About Us</u></p>
<p>Drugs &amp; Diagnostics for Tropical Diseases (DDTD) is a 501(c)(3) San Diego County based nonprofit that focuses on developing ultra-low-cost treatments and diagnostics for diseases that predominantly affect vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>DDTD embraces the idea of eliminating diseases that do not belong in the 21st century. DDTD primarily focuses on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), a group of diseases that afflicts 1 in 6 people, or approximately 1.4 billion individuals worldwide; as well as diseases that affect impoverished populations. </p>
<p>Due to the nature of our organization and its focus on developing diagnostics for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), we are primarily funded through government grants that are specifically earmarked for work on these diseases. Because of our years spent developing tests for NTDs, we have achieved a remarkably sensitive diagnostic development platform and our NTD tests can be more than 10 times more sensitive than comparable devices sold by diagnostic giants.</p>
<p>It was therefore a natural extension for us to customize our platform to the detection of COVID-19 antibodies. True to our mission, we have developed a high-quality, low-cost COVID-19 antibody test that has 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We have completed our clinical trial and are submitting an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<p><u>Donated Testing to Schools</u></p>
<p>We plan to manufacture an initial batch of 100,000 antibody tests, of which 40,000 will be donated to schools. As DDTD continues to manufacture additional tests, for every two tests sold, we will donate one to schools.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Support Your Schools</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of our organization and its focus on developing diagnostics for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), we are primarily funded through government grants that are specifically earmarked for work on these diseases. DDTD therefore needs the support of individuals in order to commercialize and donate COVID-19 antibody tests.</p>
<p><strong>DDTD has developed a unique opportunity for you to support our organization's efforts, while at the same time nominating or designating which schools will receive the donated antibody tests. </strong></p>
<p>Supporters can give at any level, and certain levels provide the ability to nominate or designate a school to receive donated tests (pending school acceptance). Giving levels and benefits are as follows:</p>
<p><u>Support Levels</u></p>
<p>$25 - Supports 2 tests for schools</p>
<p>$50 - Supports 5 tests to schools</p>
<p>$100 - Supports 10 tests to schools, enables ""nominate a school"" to receive a donation</p>
<p>$500 - Supports 50 tests to schools, enables ""nominate a school"" to receive a donation, recognition of your donation through social media and on the DDTD website</p>
<p>$1,000 - Supports 100 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated not guaranteed)</p>
<p>$2,500 - Supports 250 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated guaranteed)</p>
<p>$5,000 - Supports 500 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated guaranteed), arranged testing onsite at DDTD for friends and family (if in the San Diego area)</p>
<p>$10,000 - Supports 1,000 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated guaranteed), arranged testing onsite at DDTD for friends and family (if in the San Diego area), and a presentation ceremony with top school staff (socially distanced) with a plaque in your name to be given with the donated tests. </p>
<p>For nominations and designations, schools must be open and willing to receive donated COVID-19 antibody tests.  Supporters who give at a level that enables ""nominate a school"" or ""designation of a school"" will be contacted directly by one of DDTD's staff to obtain information on their school of choice.</p>
<p>DDTD will also be opening an online portal where schools will be able to sign up to be considered for a donation from the pool of funding we receive that is not designated to specific schools. </p>
<h3>Testing Commercialization and Distribution</h3>
<p>COVID-19 antibody test commercialization; which includes manufacturing, production, and distribution, will be highly dependent on the level of funding raised from the Indiegogo campaign. If DDTD can reach our goal of $200,000 by the end of January, we anticipate that we will be able to have tests commercialized and ready for distribution by the end of March 2021. </p>
<p>Distribution of the donated tests will be first focused on the San Diego area, where on-site coordination with schools that are receiving the tests can be managed. DDTD is moving forward with a Phase II of EUA from the FDA for point-of-care distribution, which, once approved, will enable school nurses to do testing directly and not require an onsite member of our staff and/or coordinate of a medium complexity lab. Once we receive EUA for Phase II, we will begin coordinating shipments of tests directly to schools outside of the San Diego area. We anticipate filing in the Spring of 2021, with the goal of getting tests to schools outside of San Diego before the school year starts in the fall of 2021. </p>

True to our mission, we have developed a high-quality, low-cost COVID-19 antibody test that has 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We have completed our clinical trial and are submitting an application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Donated Testing to Schools
We plan to manufacture an initial batch of 100,000 antibody tests, of which 40,000 will be donated to schools. As DDTD continues to manufacture additional tests, for every two tests sold, we will donate one to schools.

How You Can Support Your Schools
Due to the nature of our organization and its focus on developing diagnostics for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), we are primarily funded through government grants that are specifically earmarked for work on these diseases. DDTD therefore needs the support of individuals in order to commercialize and donate COVID-19 antibody tests.
DDTD has developed a unique opportunity for you to support our organization's efforts, while at the same time nominating or designating which schools will receive the donated antibody tests. 
Supporters can give at any level, and certain levels provide the ability to nominate or designate a school to receive donated tests (pending school acceptance). Giving levels and benefits are as follows:
Support Levels
$25 - Supports 2 tests for schools
$50 - Supports 5 tests to schools
$100 - Supports 10 tests to schools, enables ""nominate a school"" to receive a donation
$500 - Supports 50 tests to schools, enables ""nominate a school"" to receive a donation, recognition of your donation through social media and on the DDTD website
$1,000 - Supports 100 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated not guaranteed)
$2,500 - Supports 250 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated guaranteed)
$5,000 - Supports 500 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated guaranteed), arranged testing onsite at DDTD for friends and family (if in the San Diego area)
$10,000 - Supports 1,000 tests to schools, enables ""designation of a school"" to receive a donation (# of tests donated guaranteed), arranged testing onsite at DDTD for friends and family (if in the San Diego area), and a presentation ceremony with top school staff (socially distanced) with a plaque in your name to be given with the donated tests. 
For nominations and designations, schools must be open and willing to receive donated COVID-19 antibody tests.  Supporters who give at a level that enables ""nominate a school"" or ""designation of a school"" will be contacted directly by one of DDTD's staff to obtain information on their school of choice.
DDTD will also be opening an online portal where schools will be able to sign up to be considered for a donation from the pool of funding we receive that is not designated to specific schools. 
Testing Commercialization and Distribution
COVID-19 antibody test commercialization; which includes manufacturing, production, and distribution, will be highly dependent on the level of funding raised from the Indiegogo campaign. If DDTD can reach our goal of $200,000 by the end of January, we anticipate that we will be able to have tests commercialized and ready for distribution by the end of March 2021. 
Distribution of the donated tests will be first focused on the San Diego area, where on-site coordination with schools that are receiving the tests can be managed. DDTD is moving forward with a Phase II of EUA from the FDA for point-of-care distribution, which, once approved, will enable school nurses to do testing directly and not require an onsite member of our staff and/or coordinate of a medium complexity lab. Once we receive EUA for Phase II, we will begin coordinating shipments of tests directly to schools outside of the San Diego area. We anticipate filing in the Spring of 2021, with the goal of getting tests to schools outside of San Diego before the school year starts in the fall of 2021.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/>Hi! My name is Jolene and I love to Dance.</p>
<p><br/>I don't dance to perform, or know the right moves, I dance because it makes me feel alive!<br/>I do what's called conscious dance* and over the past 10 years it's been for me a life-line, a good time, a struggle, a release, therapy, a break-through and a place of gratitude. I've moved through pain and anger and joy and love, and everything in between, and gotten to feel and express it all in a safe and liberating way, and now want to share it with as many people as possible. Including you!</p>
<p><br/>It's taken me a long time to find the right facilitation training - in fact it didn't exist until quite recently when one of my favorite facilitators, Brian Bergman decided to combine 20 years of yoga teaching with his Dancing Freedom facilitation experience and expert DJ skills to create the Dance Awake Facilitation training. Which I am now busy doing. I've never been as excited to do my homework in my life!</p>
<p><br/>I'm raising money to pay for the tuition fees, as well as a very good sound system and DJ rig, to start offering classes as soon as possible.</p>
<p><br/>One of the main reasons for crowd funding is that I want you with me on this journey!</p>
<p><br/>For $5 (~R70) you get entrance into a class**. If you can't attend yourself, the money will pay the entrance for someone who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford the experience.</p>
<p><br/>For $45 (~R600) you get a 1 hr one-on-one facilitation (perfect if you worry about what other people think, but want to practice getting into your body) and $60 you get a 2 hr one-on-one facilitation.</p>
<p><br/>For $150 (~R2000) you get an entire class for you and your friends!** Think birthday... OR you can gift this class to a community group that wouldn't otherwise have access to this kind of opportunity.</p>
<p><br/>So, if you've ever been moved by Dance, please support this project! The more you give, the more people get to move. Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Our health issues are inextricably tied to our environmental issues.

We are so happy that you have made your way here today and cannot wait to share with you our mission. We hope that you are as excited as we are about embarking on this new journey! We believe that every believer in The God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob in these modern times is challenged as to how true their faith is, is The Bible the Word of God and therefore True? We believe we have found amazing evidence that will prove The Bible to be true and will build faith and confidence in trusting in its Author and give opportunity for health and wellness to those who believe.   </p><p>So without a further ado let’s get into some of what we have discovered. We have found lots of jaw dropping secrets and we can’t share them all here but will give the opportunity to access the information via our e book. This is going to take a little bit of time but if you are passionate about Scripture it will be well worth the time spent.</p><p>''My people <strong>perish</strong> from lack of knowledge.'' Hos 6:4 </p><p>That knowledge is ancient biblical knowledge, and in that source of knowledge we find a secret, one of many secrets to be found, long hidden from us in plain sight that has now come to light - a secret to understanding ancient biblical healing!</p><p>''There is precious treasure and OIL in the dwelling of the wise.'' Pro 21:20</p><p>The wisest man to ever live wrote that text, so why does a wise man have OIL in his dwelling? Let’s find out. We find multiple witnesses in Scripture of OIL being used for spiritual purposes and for healing, we going to look at four examples of the healing aspect of OIL from The Old Testament and The New Testament.</p><p>''From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with OIL.'' Isa 1:6 </p><p>''Is there no balm (oil mixed with spices) in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?'' Jer 8:22 </p><p>''He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on OIL and wine.'' Luk 10:34</p><p>''Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the congregation to pray over them and anoint them with OIL in the Name of The Lord.'' James 5:14</p><p>Anointing oils were used for healing and we have got to ask ourselves why is it that today so many people are turning to essential oils for health and wellness and experiencing amazing results so much so that it is speculated that the essential oils business in the USA will double in the next two years? I believe the answers can be found in Scripture!</p><p>First we must correctly define anointing OIL, contrary to popular belief anointing OIL in The Scripture is made of Olive OIL and spices and not Olive OIL alone. The spices were the ‘’medicine’’ and the Olive Oil the ‘’carrier OIL’’. Modern essential oil practice follows this example as the essential oils are the ‘’medicine’’ and 90% of the time an aroma therapist will advise you that in order to get full benefit from an essential oil or for it to be effective you must mix the essential oil into a ‘’carrier oil’’ like Olive oil.</p><p>Why is that? Could The Scripture have the answers? Yes it does! King David gives us this amazing witness, are you ready for our Creator to reveal why so many are experiencing breakthroughs with essential oil use?</p><p>We going to look at this text using ‘’Young‘s Literal Translation’’</p><p>''And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst<strong>, And as oil into his bones.</strong>''<strong> </strong>Psa 109:18 </p><p>Did you see it? King David tells us under the influence of Ruach HaKodesh (The Holy Spirit) that OIL SINKS INTO OUR BONES! Why is that amazing you ask? Well for the answer let’s turn to modern science, here  is a hint, the answer lays in the function of our bones.</p><p>Science tell us that our bones produce our BLOOD and IMMUNE SYSTEM!</p><p>Dr. Brad J. Spellberg, MD , Infectious Disease, answered</p><p>The bone marrow is the site of production of all blood cells, including white blood cells.

We are so happy that you have made your way here today and cannot wait to share with you our mission. We hope that you are as excited as we are about embarking on this new journey! We believe that every believer in The God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob in these modern times is challenged as to how true their faith is, is The Bible the Word of God and therefore True? We believe we have found amazing evidence that will prove The Bible to be true and will build faith and confidence in trusting in its Author and give opportunity for health and wellness to those who believe.   So without a further ado let’s get into some of what we have discovered. We have found lots of jaw dropping secrets and we can’t share them all here but will give the opportunity to access the information via our e book. This is going to take a little bit of time but if you are passionate about Scripture it will be well worth the time spent.''My people perish from lack of knowledge.'' Hos 6:4 That knowledge is ancient biblical knowledge, and in that source of knowledge we find a secret, one of many secrets to be found, long hidden from us in plain sight that has now come to light - a secret to understanding ancient biblical healing!''There is precious treasure and OIL in the dwelling of the wise.'' Pro 21:20The wisest man to ever live wrote that text, so why does a wise man have OIL in his dwelling? Let’s find out. We find multiple witnesses in Scripture of OIL being used for spiritual purposes and for healing, we going to look at four examples of the healing aspect of OIL from The Old Testament and The New Testament.''From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and raw wounds; they are not pressed out or bound up or softened with OIL.'' Isa 1:6 ''Is there no balm (oil mixed with spices) in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?'' Jer 8:22 ''He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on OIL and wine.'' Luk 10:34''Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the congregation to pray over them and anoint them with OIL in the Name of The Lord.'' James 5:14Anointing oils were used for healing and we have got to ask ourselves why is it that today so many people are turning to essential oils for health and wellness and experiencing amazing results so much so that it is speculated that the essential oils business in the USA will double in the next two years? I believe the answers can be found in Scripture!First we must correctly define anointing OIL, contrary to popular belief anointing OIL in The Scripture is made of Olive OIL and spices and not Olive OIL alone. The spices were the ‘’medicine’’ and the Olive Oil the ‘’carrier OIL’’. Modern essential oil practice follows this example as the essential oils are the ‘’medicine’’ and 90% of the time an aroma therapist will advise you that in order to get full benefit from an essential oil or for it to be effective you must mix the essential oil into a ‘’carrier oil’’ like Olive oil.Why is that? Could The Scripture have the answers? Yes it does! King David gives us this amazing witness, are you ready for our Creator to reveal why so many are experiencing breakthroughs with essential oil use?We going to look at this text using ‘’Young‘s Literal Translation’’''And he putteth on reviling as his robe, And it cometh in as water into his midst, And as oil into his bones.'' Psa 109:18 Did you see it? King David tells us under the influence of Ruach HaKodesh (The Holy Spirit) that OIL SINKS INTO OUR BONES! Why is that amazing you ask? Well for the answer let’s turn to modern science, here  is a hint, the answer lays in the function of our bones.Science tell us that our bones produce our BLOOD and IMMUNE SYSTEM!Dr. Brad J. Spellberg, MD , Infectious Disease, answeredThe bone marrow is the site of production of all blood cells, including white blood cells. White blood cells are what defend our bodies from infections. So, if the bone marrow does not work right, and white cells are not produced in adequate numbers or with normal function, the body becomes at risk for infection. https://www.sharecare.com/health/immune-lymphat...  What does this mean? Well according to the Bible, Biblical medicines which were aromatics, as are essential oils, were mixed into a ‘’carrier oil’’ and the physical healing properties of these aromatics was carried by the carrier oil to the very epicenter of the users blood and immune production system giving their bones the necessary building blocks to produce a strong immune system which in turn would causes healing.Sorry but right now I must add a big HaleluYah!It’s amazing that the essential oils industry named these base oils ‘’carrier oils’’ and this name that was chosen by people who don’t know this Biblical information we are sharing with you today perfectly matches the function of oil as per King David’s 3000 year old testimony, as the ‘’carrier oil’’ carries or transports the aromatic additive in it to the bones!Let’s take a look at King David’s 3000 year old witness from another angle not only does this text gives us the revelation of the importance of anointing your body with oil He also gives us the revelation of the importance of bathing in salts and spices. We going to look at the English Standard Version of the text.''He clothed himself with cursing as his coat; may it soak into his body like water, like oil into his bones!'' Psa 109:18 HaleluYah!From this truly amazing Biblical text we understand that water soaks into our bodies and therefore water that has spices or salts in it sinks into our bodies as well and would carry the healing properties of those spices and salts into their bodies and they would experience their healing effects. It doesn’t stop there while enjoying this bath the fragrance of the spices would also give its ancient user a simultaneous aromatherapy treatment!''…a threefold cord is not quickly broken.'' Ecc 4:12 According to the evidence we see in The Bible this is the threefold cord to Ancient Biblical Health and Wellness!Anointing oilsBath SoaksFoodThese three aspects where the Health, Healing, Wellness and Healing equivalent to the battleflied warriors, sword, helmet and shield, essential elements for victory on the war on sickness illness and disease.Our Creator gave mankind anointing oils and spices for medicine and 3000 years ago through King David left us this Bible text so that we could understand this process and today we sharing this with you and we have proof that this is true because in the last 20 years hundreds of thousands of people who do not know this information have turned to essential oils for health and wellness and are confirming and experiencing Biblical health and Wellness without knowing it, and that number is growing rapidly every day!This is the tip of the ice burg of information YHVH (The LORD) has revealed to us over the past few months, if this peaked your interest then please partner with us and download a copy of our e-book where we reveal even more amazing Biblical insights on the subject of Biblical Health and Wellness.For example.Which carrier oil do we believe to be most effective.In essential oil circles Frankincense is being hailed as a ‘’cure all miracle oil’’ why is this so? What if we told you that over 4000 years ago our Creator revealed this fact to us through the writings of Moses in a way that will knock your socks off!What does the Bible says about meditation, incense/aromatherapy? The Bible not only gives us evidence of these being used it also reveals the secret key to how meditation, incense/aromatherapy and breathing work! Out of all the creation mankind is the only creature obsessed with how we smell! Is this just a random characteristic?

<h3>The Reason</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Beau, i am 29 years old, a fiance, a father, and a home owner.</p>
<p>Lately i have noticed that the world is a little disconnected.</p>
<p>We live in our phones and don' t interact anymore.</p>
<p>So for anyone who is going out to a club and see's someone that they want to talk to but doesn' t know what to say, hand them a 'Free Hug Card'.</p>
<p>For anyone who is coming home after a long day at work and just wants their partner to hold them but doesn't want to ask, hand them a 'Free Hug Card'.</p>
<p>For anyone that walks past someone having a bad day and you want to help, hand them a 'Free Hug Card'.</p>
<p>The best thing about a hug is they are free and transferable, but to give one without some sort of indication would be strange. </p>
<p>So please, donate :).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The How</h3>
<p>I' m not just guessing here I do have some Photoshop skills and a basic understanding of the printing industry as i did work for a graphics design business for 2 years.</p>
<p>The cards will be high quality, at least 310 gsm, matt, full color both sides.</p>
<p>The reason for the $1000 target is to be able to get enough people interested so i can start distributing small packets of 10 'Free Hug' cards to as many people as possible and to get them to fill in a testimony form to show how the cards helped them or better yet how they helped somebody else.</p>
<p>My main goal is to get enough interest to open a website that people can place orders with and actually distribute for a much longer time.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>The reason why i thought the hug cards would be a good idea is because it gets people interacting again, at worst it gives someone a laugh because of the corniness, at best it gives someone a shoulder to cry on knowing that someone cares.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Way</h3>
<p>My brother still runs the graphics design / printing business that i worked at, so being able to access a printer and getting the cards made isn't the hard part for me.</p>
<p>The hard part is you, i need you.</p>
<p>Having the cards available for sale doesn't get sales, i need people that want to go out and talk with a stranger, that want to help someone in need, or someone that just wants a hug, i need all of you to get involved, get the cards out there for other people to get interested.</p>
<p>If you are needing a Hug, someone looks like they need a Hug, or there is a special someone you want to Hug. Hand them a #Freehugcard.</p>
<p> </p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Why high-tech in a fridge? Isn’t it more expensive than traditional methods?</strong></p>
<p>If there is a problem which hasn’t been solved for the past decades, technology is likely to be the solution.</p>
<p>Whether it is the perishable food redistribution in a short amount of time, or the safety control of the fridge access, this cannot be possible without technology.</p>
<p>While tackling the same problem as we do, traditional methods involve high operational costs such as transportation and storage. Most of the resources are spent on the maintenance of the current operation, with a small portion left for improving the solution itself.</p>
<p>FUUDY will build a model that is scalable. It operates with low-cost given the automation, and can be self-sustainable with additional revenue streams such as advertisements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will you ensure food safety?</strong></p>
<p>The criteria of shared food is: if you wouldn’t eat it, don’t put it in the fridge. For safety reasons, the fridge will not accept raw fish, eggs, meat, open canned and dried goods. For prepared food, we also ask sharers to use labels provided at the fridge to label the date it was made, and to the best of your knowledge, whether it contained or have been contacted with<a href=""http://foodallergycanada.ca/about-allergies/food-allergens/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> food allergens as set by Health Canada</a> as priority allergens.</p>
<p>The user registration and identification process prevent inappropriate use of the fridge. While we didn’t find any food poisoning cases reported among existing community fridges across the world in history, we will monitor and address the first signs of inappropriate use.</p>
<p>Our volunteers will inspect the food regularly. Once the app is launched, extra points will be provided to donors and food savers (people who bring other’s food to the fridge) for food inspection while using the fridge. We are also looking into automatic food inspection technologies that could be installed in the fridge, feel free to contact us if you want to discuss more.</p> <p><strong>Where will you place the fridges?</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking approval from the government for placing our first fridge on the street at downtown Toronto. We also have some communities and restaurant partners expressing their interest in hosting a fridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What if the campaign does not meet the goals or stretch goals? Would you still continue the development?</strong></p>
<p>As our campaign goal is flexible, your contribution will go toward the development of FUUDY after the campaign finishes. Even if the original goal is not met, we will still deliver our tote bags and virtual perks. For perks related to the first fridge, we would keep you updated and try our best to delivery in 2018.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Will this initiative go beyond Toronto and Canada?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We currently have partners in the UK and China. If we make it happen, FUUDY will be likely to go to these countries in the near future. We are excited to expand FUUDY’s partner network in Canada and other countries to fight against world hunger and food waste.</p> <p><strong>If the fridge comes offline- will I be held liable for the food I share?</strong></p>
<p>NOPE! Canada's Donation of Food Act passed in 1994 protects donors from liabilities for any damages caused by the consumption of the food shared. Sadly, not many people know about it.</p>
<p>When integrated smart lock to the fridge, we will also put a disclaimer on the fridge to legally exempt donors from any responsibility, including negligence. Users will need to accept the disclaimer before using the fridge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Would sharing surplus food encourage more waste?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely no! We aim to tackle the fundamental cause of food waste issues, but it will be a long process. While waste can not be eliminated overnight, sharing edible surplus food feeds millions of hungry people and raise the public awareness of food waste. As people share more, they will change the food waste habit. The hunger and food recovery data will also help institutions to further solve this problem.</p> <p><strong>Are you a non-profit?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, FUUDY is a initiated project under The Futurists, a registered federal non-profit organization in Canada, and a verified non-profit on Google and Indiegogo.</p> <p><strong>Can I use Indiegogo’s email receipt for tax-deduction purpose?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Indiegogo’s nonprofit program does not apply to Canadian nonprofits, so the email receipt for your contribution cannot be used for a tax deduction purpose. Please contact info@fuudy.org for more information.</p> <p><strong>Can I donate from outside Canada?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Indiegogo only accepts international credit cards, not bank or debit cards. Unfortunately, we can’t accept PayPal, so the way to donate internationally is with a credit card.</p> <p><strong>What payment methods do you accept?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo accepts all major credit cards.</p>
<p><br/><strong>I have more questions. Who could I turn to?</strong></p>
<p>Please contact info@fuudy.org to ask your question. We are more than happy to get back to you as soon as we can.</p>

If we have 200 people to support and donate, for the average price of a cup of coffee a week, we can help 36,500 people in need!
 
Join FUUDY's Movement Against Hunger!
In 2018, we will launch our pilot fridge in downtown Toronto. The pilot will help us decide the best model to scale up across cities and countries.
 
The pilot fridge will redistribute food at the level of smartness determined by our campaign results. In other words, it is determined by you!
 
Support Us On Indiegogo
We have built FUUDY to a proof of concept and what you see today. Now, we are one step away from bringing this to the street, and we need your support to make this happen.

Your support decides how many people we could help, and you will always be part of this, as your names, words, voice and even video will be on the 1st SmartSharing Fridge!

Stretch Goals

 
About Us
The FUUDY Team
We are a group of students and young professionals who want to use technology and creativity to improve existing solutions to hunger and food waste problems. Our team also include volunteers from 12 universities and across industries.
 
Roadmap

FAQ

Why high-tech in a fridge? Isn’t it more expensive than traditional methods?
If there is a problem which hasn’t been solved for the past decades, technology is likely to be the solution.
Whether it is the perishable food redistribution in a short amount of time, or the safety control of the fridge access, this cannot be possible without technology.
While tackling the same problem as we do, traditional methods involve high operational costs such as transportation and storage. Most of the resources are spent on the maintenance of the current operation, with a small portion left for improving the solution itself.
FUUDY will build a model that is scalable. It operates with low-cost given the automation, and can be self-sustainable with additional revenue streams such as advertisements.
 
How will you ensure food safety?
The criteria of shared food is: if you wouldn’t eat it, don’t put it in the fridge. For safety reasons, the fridge will not accept raw fish, eggs, meat, open canned and dried goods. For prepared food, we also ask sharers to use labels provided at the fridge to label the date it was made, and to the best of your knowledge, whether it contained or have been contacted with food allergens as set by Health Canada as priority allergens.
The user registration and identification process prevent inappropriate use of the fridge. While we didn’t find any food poisoning cases reported among existing community fridges across the world in history, we will monitor and address the first signs of inappropriate use.
Our volunteers will inspect the food regularly. Once the app is launched, extra points will be provided to donors and food savers (people who bring other’s food to the fridge) for food inspection while using the fridge. We are also looking into automatic food inspection technologies that could be installed in the fridge, feel free to contact us if you want to discuss more. Where will you place the fridges?
We are seeking approval from the government for placing our first fridge on the street at downtown Toronto. We also have some communities and restaurant partners expressing their interest in hosting a fridge.
 
What if the campaign does not meet the goals or stretch goals? Would you still continue the development?
As our campaign goal is flexible, your contribution will go toward the development of FUUDY after the campaign finishes. Even if the original goal is not met, we will still deliver our tote bags and virtual perks. For perks related to the first fridge, we would keep you updated and try our best to delivery in 2018.
Will this initiative go beyond Toronto and Canada?
Yes. We currently have partners in the UK and China. If we make it happen, FUUDY will be likely to go to these countries in the near future. We are excited to expand FUUDY’s partner network in Canada and other countries to fight against world hunger and food waste. If the fridge comes offline- will I be held liable for the food I share?
NOPE! Canada's Donation of Food Act passed in 1994 protects donors from liabilities for any damages caused by the consumption of the food shared. Sadly, not many people know about it.
When integrated smart lock to the fridge, we will also put a disclaimer on the fridge to legally exempt donors from any responsibility, including negligence. Users will need to accept the disclaimer before using the fridge.
 
Would sharing surplus food encourage more waste?
Absolutely no! We aim to tackle the fundamental cause of food waste issues, but it will be a long process. While waste can not be eliminated overnight, sharing edible surplus food feeds millions of hungry people and raise the public awareness of food waste. As people share more, they will change the food waste habit. The hunger and food recovery data will also help institutions to further solve this problem. Are you a non-profit?
Yes, FUUDY is a initiated project under The Futurists, a registered federal non-profit organization in Canada, and a verified non-profit on Google and Indiegogo. Can I use Indiegogo’s email receipt for tax-deduction purpose?
Unfortunately, Indiegogo’s nonprofit program does not apply to Canadian nonprofits, so the email receipt for your contribution cannot be used for a tax deduction purpose. Please contact info@fuudy.org for more information. Can I donate from outside Canada?
Absolutely! Indiegogo only accepts international credit cards, not bank or debit cards. Unfortunately, we can’t accept PayPal, so the way to donate internationally is with a credit card. What payment methods do you accept?
Indiegogo accepts all major credit cards.
I have more questions. Who could I turn to?
Please contact info@fuudy.org to ask your question. We are more than happy to get back to you as soon as we can.

Thank You, our partners and supporters!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is on its way to directly affecting some 45 million people globally. The costs are approaching one trillion dollars. It is getting worse, not better. The numbers are growing, not declining. Conventional approaches are failing. Only this kind of integrative, multi-faceted approach (combined with prudent use of select medications) will succeed. No matter what medical breakthroughs happen in the future, it will still be necessary to support them with this integrative approach. This IS the way of the future. By contributing to this, you will be a part of the leading edge that will finally lead to the end of Alzheimer's disease and many related dementia.</p>
<p>This approach can make a massive difference.</p>
<p>I have successfully run integrative wellness programs before. And not just anywhere. I have run these programs in world-class destinations such as Aspen, Colorado, The San Francisco Bay Area, Vancouver, B.C. Whistler B.C., and more. The programs I have developed in the past have been highly effective. I am connected to some of the greatest minds and pioneers in this field, globally. This project in particular is the most researched and carefully developed program I have been involved with. It already is working, with tremendous results. It can work for you. It can work for your loved ones. It can help everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have financed this entire project with my own resources. These are running out. Without an infusion of funds, the whole project could be in jeopardy. Without funding it cannot move any further forward. The longer this process takes the higher the probability that someone else somewhere might come up with a similar approach, and beat me to the punch. While it is unlikely that anyone will come up with a program as effective and complete, it is possible that a lower quality approach can be marketed aggressively and take market share before my book gets out into the marketplace. There could be some minor push-back from those who have a vested interest in the status-quo.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have learned to stretch a dollar. Over the years I have proved that with even meager resources I can achieve success.</li>
<li>I handle push-back and skepticism with positive results and sound science.</li>
<li>The greatest risk is not getting enough funding to successfully complete this project. Measures have been taken to still provide value to all contributors so that the educational material can still be available via coaching, consulting, and online.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you do not have the financial means to help this project and my work then you can still help: You can get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Please pass this along to all your friends, colleagues, associates, and anyone else who you think might have an interest in this.</li>
