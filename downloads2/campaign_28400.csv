<h3>The Fashion Skills Lab Series- A New Approach To Learning &amp; Creating Fashion.</h3>
<p>MANY people want to bring fashion to life. They have great ideas, so they know the desire, but what about the HOW?  Hiring people for EVERYTHING is risky and expensive. </p>
<p>Fashion is personal, and until I created the Fashion Skills Lab (FSL) Series, finding the right learning platform that engages <i>your</i> schedule and <i>your </i>learning style with thoughtful and easy topic classes has been difficult! </p>
<p>The Fashion Skills Lab (FSL) Series is a series of online fashion learning portals and workshops onsite in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Classes on the industry-  such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>sampling</li>
<li>costing</li>
<li>construction</li>
<li>patternmaking</li>
<li>choosing fabrics</li>
<li> merchandising  </li>
</ul>
<p>Affordable and accessible.  </p>
<p>So YOU can know it and do it, without having to hire a consultant or a company. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502821923/kphlxf2ddogjjs2vklcr.png"" src="""" style=""""/>FASHION INDUSTRY STUFF </p>
<p> That NO ONE TEACHES!!!!</p>
<p>Along with the online learning series, ALL students can take part in classes  - beginner, intermediate, and master - at the Fashion Skills Lab (FSL) Series Studio in Los Angeles personally taught by Amy Bond and the FSL Education Team; including other faves from Project Runway! </p>
<p>You can ASK the questions and GET the answers, without having to spend loads of time and loads of money!  Keep your day job~until you don't want to!  </p>
<p><i>WHAT DO YOU NEED TO LEARN? !?</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502945437/ti6qm3lgqzoto5vssnzc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So How? </p>
<p>It's simple:  Learn 100% online or pair <i>your</i> learning with online classes and visits to our Los Angeles fashion studio - it's <i>your</i> choice!</p>
<h3>Who is Amy Bond?  :) </h3>
<p>If you have already seen me on Project Runway, then  you know fashion has always been in my life - from learning to sew super young  to owning my own fashion company. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503003458/rars3ssczwpazgcjjeby.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Along with appearing in numerous fashion magazines, TV shows and runway shows, I have also been an award winning fashion educator with Academy of Art University, Otis Design College, and the Art Institutes. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Challenge In Going From Wanting To KNOWING. </h3>
<p>My road to learning all things Fashion lead me to obtain my Bachelors' Degree in Fashion from Stephens College in Missouri, and my Masters Degree in Fashion from the Academy of Art University in California.</p>
<p> It was a lot of time and a lot of money, but it  gave me the opportunity to teach thousands of students about fashion and design. </p>
<p>You will always learn at a fashion college and trade school, but that time and money might be too much.  What do <i>you </i>need?</p>
<p>I constantly hear the same story from people thinking about building their fashion skill sets, but not ready to invest in a set school program:</p>
<p><strong>I want to understand the kind of fabrics in the industry.  I want to know how to use fabric.  I want to feel secure with my choices - </strong><i>but a traditional school is way too much for me.</i></p>
<p><strong>I developed the ideas I already had, but needed to hire others to do everything, because I didn't know enough about construction to talk the language of fit and samples - </strong><i>but a traditional school is way too much for me.</i></p>
<p><strong>I needed to understand how to communicate the issues - </strong><i>but a traditional school was way too much for me.</i></p>
<p>A bachelor's degree in fashion design can cost around <strong>$36,000</strong> annually on the average, although the range can vary widely from <strong>$13,000</strong> to around <strong>$60,000</strong> a year. That amounts to almost <strong>$144,000</strong>!  These estimates only include the cost of tuition and not other fees like books and supplies, as well as that of room and board.</p>
<p>An associate degree normally takes two full <strong>years</strong> and includes class in <strong>fashion </strong>analysis, visual merchandising and textiles. You often have to <strong>complete</strong> an internship in the program as well. A bachelor degree takes four <strong>years</strong>, but offers more <strong>classes</strong> in <strong>design</strong> and business.</p>
<h3>The Fashion Skills Lab Series- A Simple Campaign For Everyone!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Students get to personally create their own schedule of classes for them to learn at their pace within a preset learning curriculum timeline.  </li>
<li>Each online video is pre filmed but also comes with *live discussion sessions with Amy Bond and the FLS Education Staff. *Students will have a choice of discussion session dates and times to choose from.</li>
<li>By helping us reach our goal you will be affecting thousands of people build a foundation of learning, and we believe some will change all our lives for the better.</li>

<li>We have found two locations (we can find more!).  Both are in the Metropolitan Los Angeles Area (DTLA and Studio City).  The average rent is $2,800 per month.  With utilities and insurance, we are basing the monthly operational cost at $4,200.00.  We want to allocate 6 months rent from what we raise in this campaign.  That equals $25,200.</li>

<p>EQUIPMENT &amp; SUPPLIES</p>
<ul><li> The average cost per sewing machine is $1,000.00 and we expect to use about $5,000.00 to set up the studio with learning computers (3) and all necessary workroom and office supplies.  The cost for the six (6) custom cutting tables are $500 each.  The total amount needed for equipment &amp; supplies is $16,000.00</li></ul>

My name is Laura Cvitanovich and I am an English teacher at Woodside High School in Newport News, Virginia. Read to Exceed is a project to fund the purchase a class set (32 books) of current, relevant quality literature.  Woodside is home to more than 2000 students; many of them are urban minorities who come from single parent homes, are on assisted lunch programs, or are considered socio-economically at-risk. Unfortunately, many of these kids have never been exposed to any type of literature or magazines in their homes and it affects their ability to read, comprehend, problem solve, analyze, and succeed at school and in daily life. I have witnessed first-hand how a student's perspective changes when they are introduced to literature that they find relevant, interesting, and engaging; they WANT to read, they WANT to interact and understand the text, and they WANT to discuss it with other students. Reading can open up the world for these kids. Your contribution will help purchase books for students who don't typically read books; you will be providing the tools to extend literacy to at-risk students who, I hope, will learn to read to exceed at school, college, career, and life. </div><div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I would like to raise $500 to
purchase a class set of ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" by Nathanial Philbrick.
It’s a great read, appealing to everyone but especially to boys, and it syncs
up nicely with 11<sup>th</sup> grade American Literature and US History. We
need 35 copies of this book. This will allow each student access to a book that
they will close read and discuss as a class. The books will be held at school
and will be used and shared by the English and Social Studies departments. If
we don’t reach our entire goal, we will purchase as many copies as possible and
try to fill in with library loans. If you are willing to donate $50 or more to graciously
support our cause, you will receive a Woodside High School T-shirt in black
cotton with neon teal and purple graphics.</p>
</div>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Kids who read are better writers,
thinkers, and problem solvers. Exposing kids to well written literature builds
understanding, vocabulary, thinking skills, writing skills and prepares
students for college and career. It is crucial that we, as a nation,
effectively engage our students so they can develop the literacy needed to be
citizens and leaders of tomorrow. </p>

<p>This November, hundreds of 5<sup>th</sup> graders participated
in the election of the first ever Connecticut’s Kid Governor through a pilot
program created by Connecticut’s Old State House. After an exciting race, the
students elected Elena Tipton, who ran on a Campaign for Kindness platform. Now
she needs an office and we need YOUR help in creating it! </p><p>We have the perfect
place for Elena’s office: the space that served as the Governors’ Office for 58
years in the state’s venerable Old State House, one of Connecticut’s most
historically-significant buildings. We want Elena’s office to double as a Civics
Action Lab in our museum. Our initial goal is to raise $6,000, but the more
donations we receive the more we can enhance the Lab. </p>
<p>The Civics Action Lab will engage kids and adult visitors
alike with activities centered on civic engagement and Elena’s platform of
kindness. The space will serve as an office for Connecticut’s Kid Governor,
feature information about Elena’s Campaign for Kindness and provide an area
where visitors can learn, explore and share ways to make a difference in their
own communities.</p>

</div></div>","Why a Civics
Action Lab?
This November, hundreds of 5th graders participated
in the election of the first ever Connecticut’s Kid Governor through a pilot
program created by Connecticut’s Old State House. After an exciting race, the
students elected Elena Tipton, who ran on a Campaign for Kindness platform. Now
she needs an office and we need YOUR help in creating it! We have the perfect
place for Elena’s office: the space that served as the Governors’ Office for 58
years in the state’s venerable Old State House, one of Connecticut’s most
historically-significant buildings. We want Elena’s office to double as a Civics
Action Lab in our museum. Our initial goal is to raise $6,000, but the more
donations we receive the more we can enhance the Lab. 
The Civics Action Lab will engage kids and adult visitors
alike with activities centered on civic engagement and Elena’s platform of
kindness. The space will serve as an office for Connecticut’s Kid Governor,
feature information about Elena’s Campaign for Kindness and provide an area
where visitors can learn, explore and share ways to make a difference in their
own communities.
With your helpful donation, you can bring the historic
Governor’s Office at Connecticut’s Old State House to life and connect this
space of civic leadership with contemporary examples of civic participation!Governor Elena Tipton in her future Office and Civics Action Lab

<p>In 2015, the time is ripe for peace movements to break out all over the world.</p>
<p>Who says peace is not possible? We saw how suddenly gay marriage happened all over the world, and how fast legal marijuana is happening. These examples show how quickly attitudes can change. Can a new understanding of the possibility of world peace be next?</p>
<p>We think it can. Pacifism is already bubbling all over the world, and a worldwide awakening of peaceful ideals is in the air. Pacifism21.org will provide a voice, a forum and a daily chronicle for peace-builders, activists and concerned citizens as this important movement continues to grow. </p>
<p><i>Is the world really ready to move towards peace?  </i>If you are one of those irrepressible optimists who believes the human race can have a better future, please show your support by donating to Pacifism21 today.</p>
<p>We are trying to raise $10,000 to give our website and social media presence a proper liftoff, and your donation will make a gigantic difference in helping us get our message out there, loud and clear, for all the world to hear.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pacifism21.org is nearly ready to launch ... but we cannot do it without your support. Please make a donation today, and become a part of a vibrant new online community that's about to make a splash.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What is Pacifism?</span></p>
<p>Pacifism does not have to be an absolute position: it is simply the belief that less war is better than more war. When there is a global conflict (say, in the Middle East today), a pacifist will tend to support peace talks over military escalation. When voting for a candidate, a pacifist will tend to support less military spending, and will be turned off by ""let's bomb them!"" rhetoric.</p>
<p>A pacifist is not against all reasonable self-defense, and does not have to believe that the problem of war can be solved completely. Dwight David Eisenhower was stating a pacifist position when he said these words: </p>
<p><b>""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.""</b><br/></p>
<p>Eisenhower was also one of the toughest military leaders of the 20th Century, and led the invasion of Europe to defeat Hitler during World War Two. </p>
<p>Pacifism is a broad position. A pacifist may be left wing or right wing, liberal or conservative, capitalist or socialist, Occupy or Tea Party, Christian or Jewish or Muslim or Buddhist or Hindu or agnostic or atheist. A pacifist does not have to reject violence 100% of the time, does not have to dress like Mahatma Gandhi, is not required to sing folk music.</p>
<p>If you declare yourself a pacifist, you are joining a practical movement to reduce the incidence of military escalation around the world<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  It's a common-sense idea: the idea that war is a terrible disease that we ought to try to cure, and that we ought to be able to cure. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3>Why ""Pacifism for the 21st Century""?</h3>
<p>Pacifism21 means ""Pacifism for the 21st Century"". We chose this name to counter the idea that pacifism is a naive or outdated philosophy after the violent horrors of the 20th Century.  We want to emphasize that <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">pacifism is a realistic, common-sense philosophy that is essential to the well-being of our planet.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We also want to show that pacifists can stand proud, that the broad and open-minded philosophy of life that inspired Dorothy Day, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon and Yoko Ono is a coherent and cohesive belief system that can no longer be dismissed with a joke or a stereotype.</span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need Your Money For</h3> <p>Pacifism21.org is a website and non-profit organization that intends to kickstart a movement. You are invited to be a part of this movement whether you donate or not. But one great way to become an instant part of the movement is to donate today, and we really hope that you will!</p>
<p>We are raising $10,000 so we can put Pacifism21.org on a solid footing for its first few months of operation. It takes a lot of work to run a website, to keep the content fresh and streaming, to explore avenues for interaction with members and participants. $10,000 will allow us to:</p> <ul> <li>Grow our web/social media presence.</li>
<li>Pay some writers and artists.</li>
<li>Pay for venues for our initial meetups and events </li>
<li>Publish our first book</li>
<li>Create new forms of content that will reach wider audiences, such as entertaining comic strips and innovative data visualizations.</li>
<li>Complete our registration as an official non-profit organization so we can pursue further funding opportunities, including government and NGO grants and large private donations.</li> </ul>
<p>These things are critical to our longevity. We know that we can launch a website in 2015. But can we launch a website that will last, that will evolve and improve with the changing times, that will be around to make a difference when this is needed the most? That's the question you can help us answer with a big ""YES"" if you donate today. No matter how large or small the dollar amount is, your support will make a gigantic difference.</p> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What You'll Get If You Donate</span><br/>
</h3> <p>If you donate any amount and provide your mailing address, we will send you a package of stickers that you'll be proud to display on your laptops and devices or anywhere you want.  This will also help us spread the word, so please let us send you these stickers by placing a donation of any amount today!</p>

<br/>
<p>There are other cool perks like coffee mugs available at higher donation levels, also designed to help you proudly share your support for pacifism in public in the most stylish possible way. We will also send you free copies of our first two books at the higher donation levels.</p>
<p>Most importantly: by placing a donation of any amount here on Indiegogo you are introducing yourself to us as a member of our community. We will offer to keep in touch with you at any level of participation that you wish.

</div></div>","Why Donate For Peace?
In 2015, the time is ripe for peace movements to break out all over the world.
Who says peace is not possible? We saw how suddenly gay marriage happened all over the world, and how fast legal marijuana is happening. These examples show how quickly attitudes can change. Can a new understanding of the possibility of world peace be next?
We think it can. Pacifism is already bubbling all over the world, and a worldwide awakening of peaceful ideals is in the air. Pacifism21.org will provide a voice, a forum and a daily chronicle for peace-builders, activists and concerned citizens as this important movement continues to grow. 
Is the world really ready to move towards peace?  If you are one of those irrepressible optimists who believes the human race can have a better future, please show your support by donating to Pacifism21 today.
We are trying to raise $10,000 to give our website and social media presence a proper liftoff, and your donation will make a gigantic difference in helping us get our message out there, loud and clear, for all the world to hear.
Pacifism21.org is nearly ready to launch ... but we cannot do it without your support. Please make a donation today, and become a part of a vibrant new online community that's about to make a splash.
What is Pacifism?
Pacifism does not have to be an absolute position: it is simply the belief that less war is better than more war. When there is a global conflict (say, in the Middle East today), a pacifist will tend to support peace talks over military escalation. When voting for a candidate, a pacifist will tend to support less military spending, and will be turned off by ""let's bomb them!"" rhetoric.
A pacifist is not against all reasonable self-defense, and does not have to believe that the problem of war can be solved completely. Dwight David Eisenhower was stating a pacifist position when he said these words: 
""In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex.""
Eisenhower was also one of the toughest military leaders of the 20th Century, and led the invasion of Europe to defeat Hitler during World War Two. 
Pacifism is a broad position. A pacifist may be left wing or right wing, liberal or conservative, capitalist or socialist, Occupy or Tea Party, Christian or Jewish or Muslim or Buddhist or Hindu or agnostic or atheist. A pacifist does not have to reject violence 100% of the time, does not have to dress like Mahatma Gandhi, is not required to sing folk music.
If you declare yourself a pacifist, you are joining a practical movement to reduce the incidence of military escalation around the world.  It's a common-sense idea: the idea that war is a terrible disease that we ought to try to cure, and that we ought to be able to cure. 

Why ""Pacifism for the 21st Century""?
Pacifism21 means ""Pacifism for the 21st Century"". We chose this name to counter the idea that pacifism is a naive or outdated philosophy after the violent horrors of the 20th Century.  We want to emphasize that pacifism is a realistic, common-sense philosophy that is essential to the well-being of our planet.
We also want to show that pacifists can stand proud, that the broad and open-minded philosophy of life that inspired Dorothy Day, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, John Lennon and Yoko Ono is a coherent and cohesive belief system that can no longer be dismissed with a joke or a stereotype.
   What We Need Your Money For Pacifism21.org is a website and non-profit organization that intends to kickstart a movement. You are invited to be a part of this movement whether you donate or not. But one great way to become an instant part of the movement is to donate today, and we really hope that you will!
We are raising $10,000 so we can put Pacifism21.org on a solid footing for its first few months of operation. It takes a lot of work to run a website, to keep the content fresh and streaming, to explore avenues for interaction with members and participants. $10,000 will allow us to:  Grow our web/social media presence.
Pay some writers and artists.
Pay for venues for our initial meetups and events 
Publish our first book
Create new forms of content that will reach wider audiences, such as entertaining comic strips and innovative data visualizations.
Complete our registration as an official non-profit organization so we can pursue further funding opportunities, including government and NGO grants and large private donations. 
These things are critical to our longevity. We know that we can launch a website in 2015. But can we launch a website that will last, that will evolve and improve with the changing times, that will be around to make a difference when this is needed the most? That's the question you can help us answer with a big ""YES"" if you donate today. No matter how large or small the dollar amount is, your support will make a gigantic difference.   
What You'll Get If You Donate
 If you donate any amount and provide your mailing address, we will send you a package of stickers that you'll be proud to display on your laptops and devices or anywhere you want.  This will also help us spread the word, so please let us send you these stickers by placing a donation of any amount today!



There are other cool perks like coffee mugs available at higher donation levels, also designed to help you proudly share your support for pacifism in public in the most stylish possible way. We will also send you free copies of our first two books at the higher donation levels.
Most importantly: by placing a donation of any amount here on Indiegogo you are introducing yourself to us as a member of our community. We will offer to keep in touch with you at any level of participation that you wish. We know that your donation is an expression of your deep concern with the future of the world we live in together, and we welcome your arrival as a member of the Pacifism21 team.
    What If You Have No Money To Donate? We want you on the Pacifism21 team whether you can donate or not. Go to http://pacifism21.org and enter your email address. We'll take it from there. 
    Why We REALLY Need Your Help Today We are trying to raise $10,000 for a website built around a controversial idea: the idea that pacifism is relevant and essential in 2015. The word ""pacifism"" is not popular, and is often badly misunderstood. We have to change people's minds to raise $10,000, and that's why this is not an easy campaign to launch.

</div></div>","THIS PROJECT IS ESPECIALLY RELEVANT NOW WITH THE ESCALATION OF PREJUDICE AND THE INTENSIFYING VIOLENCE WITHIN ISRAEL...
For anyone who knows that our emotions -- joy, fear, love, anger, hate, longing compassion -- move us to act and react in this world; that our feelings can start conflicts and they can also end them, please help us fund this campaign...

We, the Together Beyond Words Organization (TBW) , are creating a pilot one year 200 hour Peace Leadership Training in Israel that will teach Arab and Jewish participants to create Safe Havens for transforming the pain that is fueling the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians into understanding and empathy....
The program is composed of three long weekends (90 hours total) with teachers from The Nederlands Instituut of Cordium Core Evolutionary, bi-weekly meetings with teachers from Together Beyond Words staff (110 hours), supervision from The Radical Aliveness Institute of California , and research about the effectiveness of our approach in collaboration with Liat Ayalon from the Expressive Arts Department of Haifa University.

To see how our program can work please watch our film: https://vimeo.com/119885376


Purpose of the project:
To create a powerful training experience that allows participants to learn and apply practical skills in holding complexity, deep diversity, emotional process, trauma and conflict in a way that facilitates deep healing and transformation.
20 Israeli Arab and Jewish social activists and peace builders will participate in the pilot program. They will learn the following skills:



Handling strong feelings


Moving and grounding energy


Working with aggression


Being vulnerable


Being aware of cultural differences and the impact this has on work with deep emotional issues


Practicing the ability to be in conflict as individuals around issues of gender, race and nationality while maintaining connection.




What the funding will be used for:1. Transportation and hosting for six teachers coming from Europe to teach three times during the year for four days each time. The teachers are volunteering their teaching time.
2. Scholarships for some of the participants who are not able to pay for the cost of the program.3. Accomodations for participants and staff during the 3 four day training workshops at Nes Ammim.
3. Program  administartion.

<p>My name is Andy MacIsaac, I am a father, husband and
resident of Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.  I
am a big believer in the value of team sports for the lessons that can be taught
about teamwork, perseverance and commitment. Unfortunately students with Intellectual Disabilities
do not always have the opportunity to participate in school based team sports. A collaboration between Massachusetts Special Olympics
and local Massachusetts school districts is working to change that with the
launch of a Unified Basketball Program. </p>
<p>Unified Basketball enables student athletes with disabilities
to participate on an interscholastic athletic team along with traditional student
athletes in competition against other schools. With the Unified Program these athletes
are competing for their school, wearing their school colors, and playing for
school pride. </p>
<p>The State of Maine launched a Unified Basketball Program
last year with much success. You can see a video about their program here. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGQ1Tr4PpZ8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGQ1Tr4PpZ8</a></p>
<p>When I saw this video and the expression of pure joy and
excitement that these athletes had wearing their school colors and playing with
their teammates, I was motivated to see what it would take to bring such a
program to Shrewsbury High School.</p>
<p>Shrewsbury High School has already participated in a Unified
Track program with much success, and the
staff would be very excited to extend the Unified Sports Program this
year.  The only barrier is funding and that
is why this campaign is being launched. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 to cover programmatic costs like
uniforms, transportation and officials. Every bit of support will help establish
Unified Basketball at Shrewsbury High School for the next two years.  More importantly Unified Basketball at
Shrewsbury High School will extend the opportunity for Student Athletes with
Intellectual Disabilities to experience the joy and sense of accomplishment
that competitive high school sports can bring. </p>

facilitation tool which aims to help people overcome reading difficulties. This does not in any way limit its potential commercial use. The idea is that the reader application can convert any
document format into a traversable mind-map. Each node would have audio-visual cues to help the reader. 
The reader itself builds around a spritz-speed-reading like
mechanism, where each node within the mind-map can be individually parsed and read. This allows the reader to comprehend the text being read in
a more visually positioned way vis-à-vis the complete text.
This app would allow the user to read a specific text within a mind-map context, where large bulk text is converted into nodes, with each node potentially having children nodes, and so on. This text within the selected node can also link particular
key words to hyperlinks outside of the document to provide a more multi-modal
approach. The app can automatically read out loud highlighted selected text. Online translation of specific words or sub-text is also being considered.
Documents can be of any format or medium, even web sites. The way it works is as follows. Text is converted into a mind-map, which is in turn
traversable, and each specific node is read by the reader. 
For example take http://www.lipsum.com/




The text within it is automatically converted into a
mind-map, as per below.




By zooming into each mind-map, the user can decide at what
point the reader is activated. The selected text below is processed by the reader automatically
from left to right as per image below.


""There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum
available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.""





The reader can link key words to other sites, audio-visual
media etc.. Translate media into various languages etc.. This functionality will be particularly helpful with people who have
attention disorders, dyslexia and other learning/reading disabilities
What We Need 
 We need funding primarily to fund 2 developers for the duration of the project. This should take approximately 1 year. I shall myself be working on this project on a pro-bono basis. For me this is a very personal endeavor. 
The project itself can be divided into two development phases:


Complete the application to run on traditional Windows OS Environment.


Complete the application to run on Android and OS.


A final third phase is the actual roll-out. At each step the backers will be asked to test out beta or trial versions and give in their feedback. Like this, it will not be just crowd funding but also introduce the idea of crowd testing.
The funding request being made is relatively small, so it is unlikely that we will have unused funds. 


The Impact

 If this project is a success than traditional reading is going to be hyped with audio visual technology. Can you imagine the impact of such a technology? This could literally be a game changer in the education sector, and in day-to-day usage of web pages and e-books.
Let's give it a go together! The education system all over the world is letting numerous children behind. Let's give everyone a chance to make it in life. We might not succeed in full, but we owe it to ourselves to try.

<p>The reason for my campaign, Justice For

my two-year incarceration in a federal penitentiary. </p>
<p>While there, my cellmate for 13 months
was Colonel George Trofimoff. In exchange for telling me his life story and

get a new trial. </p>

<p>What my <b>Justice For All</b> campaign is really about is the First Amendment
right of free speech and the duty of transparency in jury trials. </p>
<p>The recent book, <i>Unfair</i>,
by professor Adam Benforado, (Amazon) sets forth a problem most people don't
know about -- the breakdown in our judicial systems, both state and federal.

<p> My book<i>, Observer: The Colonel George Trofimoff

me ten years to investigate, write, and complete. </p>
<p>With your help, I’ll use the money to
market my book widely. You see, it’s my belief that the citizens of three
countries -- America, England, and Germany -- need to know what happened in
this trial, and the only way that can now happen is to bring this book to their
attention. </p>
<p>Further, with your help, we can educate
citizens in these countries to what is happening to free speech and judicial
transparency.</p>
<p><b><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></b></p>
<p>I’ve carefully estimated what it
will cost to market the Colonel George Trofimoff Story, and that amount is
$7,500. You may know this yourself that marketing one’s book – or any business
venture -- is a labor of love yet a labor-intensive work. Some of the money
will be used to reach radio show hosts, following the steps detailed in Alex
Carroll’s marketing guide. Those steps include printing materials and mailing
costs to at least one hundred radio show hosts.</p>
<p>For your part in helping this
happen, I want to gift you with Book 3 of The Prison Trilogy: Prison People;
the Prison Experience. In it, you’ll read about the people who were a part of
my prison existence for those two years, what they were like, and why they were
there. It’s an eye-opener, one that will surprise, entertain, and sadden you. </p>

<p>My campaign starts with the

Great Britain and Germany, because many of the events occurred there and will
be of interest.</p>
<p>Throughout Colonel George Trofimoff’s
trial in a Florida federal court, the media denied him any critical analysis in
favor of sensationalism. The Department of Justice was the reverse of
transparent by using a former KGB spy, on the take, to help convict the Colonel,
and hiding -- or at least not allowing access to -- potentially exonerating
evidence. While the defense attorney was asleep to procedural  misjustice
in order to earn his court-appointed stipend, the federal judge continued to
allow the prosecutor to manipulate the evidence. </p>
<p>While my book is
self-published nonfiction because I chose not to deal with the traditional
publishing firms, the book is well-edited by editor Natalie Rotunda. The story
covers the life of Colonel George Trofimoff, the dishonest FBI sting, the
overreach of federal prosecution at trial, and the malpractice of the defense
lawyer.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Math tutor is a newly developing iOS and soon to come Android app that enables students to learn study math in a way they can enjoy. Math Tutor solves problems to crucial and challenging mathematical topics and shows the steps how to do it. Now you may ask yourself, ""isn't this cheating?"" or ""Isn't this app like <i>Symbolab</i>?"" </span></h3>
<div>And to answer those questions, No. This app is not to let students see the answers and help them do their homework the ""easy way"" but rather as a tool to walk them though an equation to help them understand a topic they did not get in class or rusty on something. After each problem, in order for the student to solve another problem they must answer a multiple choice question to test their knowledge about the topic. And to answer the question about Symbolab, it is like it in away but also very different. The app will allow students to take a picture of an equation and solve it based on the keywords and equation given. Math Tutor will also have a chemistry function (a later function) and a physics function (also a later function) which allows students to see how to balance chemistry equations, or do kinematic equations by plugging in a few variables. Also coming soon in later updates after the release of the app, are SAT and AP style <span>mathematics practice tests which will show the user what they need to work on! <br/></span>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About (me) the </span>Developer</h3>
<p>I am Joshua Baney. I am a Senior high school student who loves Science, Technology and Mathematics. I grew up with computers and I love to write code and build electronics. I got this idea for Math Tutor after a few peers I tutor from my school wanted me to help them, and for a project to submit in addition with my Massachusetts Institute of Technology  (MIT) application.  Because my busy schedule constantly caused me to have conflicting times with my peers I tutor, decided to come up with an app that will do the tutoring for me! It will show how to do math problems and give them a problem afterwards to see how they are advancing. In my opinion, Math Tutor can be another great resource, like Kahn Academy to let students have access to a resource that would typically cost an arm and a leg such as a tutor for absolutely no cost. Thats right, completely free! That is, if I can fund the development of this app. </p>
<p>Here is a little bit of a background about me and my skills and interests:</p>
<p>-I was an intern with University of Maryland, Baltimore County as a software engineering intern to develop software to work with Beagle Bones and instruments I've built to help scientist and chemistry students collect data from experiments.</p>
<p>-I am fluent in C, C++, Java, Python, and MatLAB languages. </p>
<p>-I like to develop software and programs that can help people's lives.</p>
<p>-I also enjoy filmmaking and producing YouTube channel's for people. </p>
<p>-I am a huge music enthusiast. I love to play the Clarinet, and make Electronic Dance Music. I took AP Music Theory, and I love to compose music. My favorite bands, composers and artist include: Fall Out Boy, All Time Low, Skrillex, Flux Pavilion, Twenty One Pilots, Imagine Dragons, The Bleachers, John Williams and Beethoven.

<h3>The Impact of how this will help students learn Math</h3> <p>For a lot of people, math is challenging due to the material not being engaging. Also, coming from a school where I had a bad math teacher, I was not prepared as well for upper level math classes such as Pre-Calculus or AP Calculus. I love math but I do know how it feels to not learn something then be expected to know it in later math courses. This tool will help guide students to better understand how the answers to their math problems derived from. This is also useful because if a student does not like the teaching style of a teacher, they will not get the material being taught to them. After the official release of the app, I anticipate of adding 'themes' to the app to make the user feel more connected with it. These themes will include different ways of showing how the answer is done by the user's style of learning (if the user is a hands on learner, a visual learner, or learns better from listening). This will also be taken a step further with the ability to choose 'interests'. These interests will make studying more relatable to the user. For example, if a user is interested in science, word problems that are linked to science or use some application of a math problem in a science topic will appear for the user so they can do problems they can relate to and interest them. Or maybe the user is interested in sports... word problems will be generated to suit that student. </p>
<p>Another feature that will come soon is a forums feature that allows students to connect to each other and get help from other peers and discuss different topics in math and science. In addition to that, there will be AP and SAT style pre-tests to show the user what they should work on and develop a study plan of action for them to take. </p>

<p>I need to pay the developers and programmers and that will take 70% of the money I am raising. So far, I spent 300+ man hours on this app and I am still developing it. I am also having problems developing the camera application for I cannot develop a decent algorithm to convert the picture to text. However, I am friends with a computer scientist who would love to help... If they get paid. I also want to implement different versions of this app across different devices. I want EVERYONE to have access to this app, not just Apple users. </p>
<p>I also need to develop a website and forums. </p>

<p>Yet, everything we learn and accomplish with these children we will be able to replicate throughout the world later on. Why do I declare that?

<p><b>Este es un proyecto diseñado para implementar ESTACIONES DE ACTIVIDAD orientadas a alimentar el cableado neuronal en una muestra de 4 a 5 niños entre los 3 y 7 años de edad. PARA ESTE PROYECTO </b>estamos pidiendo vuestro apoyo para implementar estas estaciones a lo largo de los siguientes 4 meses (entre Enero y Abril). Vuestra contribución nos permitirá completar tareas específicas y si vuestro aporte nos permite COMPLETAR TODAS LAS TAREAS entonces estarán promoviendo una pedagogía cerebro-centrada  y el desarrollo de 4 a 5 niños durante este periodo. </p>
<p>Sin embargo, todo lo que aprendamos y logremos con estos niños podremos nosotros replicar a lo largo y ancho del mundo más adelante. Y por qué digo esto? Pues, porque esta es la naturaleza de la teoría detrás de estas acciones.  Si  alguno de ustedes desea leer la teoría por favor vayan <b><a href=""http://escuelasnoesianas.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AQUI</a>.</b>  En la siguiente seccion encontraran una breve síntesis del sustento teórico. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>ABOUT STATIONS OF ACTIVITY</b></h3>
Neural wiring depends on EXPERIENCE and experience depends on ACTIVITY. The right activity ensures right EXPERIENCE. The right experience ensures the correct neural wiring. But, what is ""RIGHT""? The correct experience happens when the activity offered has the correct amounts of <b>pressure,  novelty, demands, challenges and risks</b> during a prudent time. </div><div>Too much pressure and the brain gets overwhelmed. Not enough pressure and the brain gets bored. The brain tries to give the experience the right pressure according to its nature. The right pressure AWAKENS the brain and fosters the correct wiring to happen. But most importantly: the right pressure fosters the use of the PROPIOCEPTIVE sense. </div><div>On this premise we have identified 61 Stations of activity, many Scenarios of Activity and many more Circuits of Activity. What you will contribute to is the implementation of  SOME stations of activity (limited to the small space and the short time we have available -4 months). </div><div>During this time we will focus our efforts on feeding our children´s need to receive the adequate pressure from outside so that they can meet, get to know, harbor and harvest their own pressure from their own insides including their PROPIOCEPTION. This is akin to developing the wiring of CONTROL. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><b>EL CABLEADO NEURONAL </b>depende de la EXPERIENCIA y la experiencia depende de la ACTIVIDAD. La
correcta actividad asegura la correcta EXPERIENCIA. Y la correcta experiencia
asegura el correcto cableado neuronal. Pero, qué es lo ""CORRECTO?"" La
correcta experiencia ocurre cuando la actividad ofrecida brinda el monto
correcto de <b>presión, novedad, exigencia, retos y riesgos</b> durante un tiempo
prudencial. </p>
<p>Demasiada presión y el cerebro se abruma. Insuficiente presión y el
cerebro se aburre. El cerebro intenta darle a una experiencia la presión correcta
de acuerdo a su naturaleza. La presión correcta DESPIERTA al cerebro y promueve
el cableado correcto.  Pero más importantemente: la presión correcta obliga y permite el uso de la PROPIOCEPCION. </p>
<p>Sobre esta premisa hemos identificado 61 estaciones de
actividad, muchos otros escenarios de actividad y un número de circuitos de
actividad. Lo que ustedes estarán haciendo es contribuir a la implementación de
algunas estaciones de actividad (limitados por el espacio y la corta duracion
de este proyecto -4 meses).</p>
<p>Durante
este lapso enfocaremos nuestros esfuerzos para alimentar la necesidad de
nuestros niños de recibir la adecuada presión desde afuera de modo que ellos
puedan conocer, acoger y cultivar sus propias presiones provenientes de su
interior y su propiocepción.  Esto equivale a ir desarrollando el cableado del CONTROL y su
AUTONOMIA. </p>

The right pressure AWAKENS the brain and fosters the correct wiring to happen. Propioception is the key ingredient in this mix.

OUR CURRENT PROPOSAL FOR PROJECT LEO
This is a project designed to implement STATIONS OF ACTIVITY geared towards feeding neural wiring in a sample of 4 to 5 children between the ages of 3 to 7 years old. We are asking your support for this project so that we may implement these Stations of Activity throughout the following four months (between january and april). Your contribution will allow to complete particular tasks and if your support allows us to COMPLETE ALL TASKS then you will be furthering a brain-entered pedagogy and the development of 4 to 5 children during this period of time. 

Yet, everything we learn and accomplish with these children we will be able to replicate throughout the world later on. Why do I declare that? Well, because that is the nature of the theory behind these actions!  So if you want to read theory please go to THIS ADDRESS. Yet in the following section you will find a brief aspect of the theory regarding Stations of Activity.  
Este es un proyecto diseñado para implementar ESTACIONES DE ACTIVIDAD orientadas a alimentar el cableado neuronal en una muestra de 4 a 5 niños entre los 3 y 7 años de edad. PARA ESTE PROYECTO estamos pidiendo vuestro apoyo para implementar estas estaciones a lo largo de los siguientes 4 meses (entre Enero y Abril). Vuestra contribución nos permitirá completar tareas específicas y si vuestro aporte nos permite COMPLETAR TODAS LAS TAREAS entonces estarán promoviendo una pedagogía cerebro-centrada  y el desarrollo de 4 a 5 niños durante este periodo. 
Sin embargo, todo lo que aprendamos y logremos con estos niños podremos nosotros replicar a lo largo y ancho del mundo más adelante. Y por qué digo esto? Pues, porque esta es la naturaleza de la teoría detrás de estas acciones.  Si  alguno de ustedes desea leer la teoría por favor vayan AQUI.  En la siguiente seccion encontraran una breve síntesis del sustento teórico. 


ABOUT STATIONS OF ACTIVITY
Neural wiring depends on EXPERIENCE and experience depends on ACTIVITY. The right activity ensures right EXPERIENCE. The right experience ensures the correct neural wiring. But, what is ""RIGHT""? The correct experience happens when the activity offered has the correct amounts of pressure,  novelty, demands, challenges and risks during a prudent time. Too much pressure and the brain gets overwhelmed. Not enough pressure and the brain gets bored. The brain tries to give the experience the right pressure according to its nature. The right pressure AWAKENS the brain and fosters the correct wiring to happen. But most importantly: the right pressure fosters the use of the PROPIOCEPTIVE sense. On this premise we have identified 61 Stations of activity, many Scenarios of Activity and many more Circuits of Activity. What you will contribute to is the implementation of  SOME stations of activity (limited to the small space and the short time we have available -4 months). During this time we will focus our efforts on feeding our children´s need to receive the adequate pressure from outside so that they can meet, get to know, harbor and harvest their own pressure from their own insides including their PROPIOCEPTION. This is akin to developing the wiring of CONTROL. 
EL CABLEADO NEURONAL depende de la EXPERIENCIA y la experiencia depende de la ACTIVIDAD. La
correcta actividad asegura la correcta EXPERIENCIA. Y la correcta experiencia
asegura el correcto cableado neuronal. Pero, qué es lo ""CORRECTO?"" La
correcta experiencia ocurre cuando la actividad ofrecida brinda el monto
correcto de presión, novedad, exigencia, retos y riesgos durante un tiempo
prudencial. 
Demasiada presión y el cerebro se abruma. Insuficiente presión y el
cerebro se aburre. El cerebro intenta darle a una experiencia la presión correcta
de acuerdo a su naturaleza. La presión correcta DESPIERTA al cerebro y promueve
el cableado correcto.  Pero más importantemente: la presión correcta obliga y permite el uso de la PROPIOCEPCION. 
Sobre esta premisa hemos identificado 61 estaciones de
actividad, muchos otros escenarios de actividad y un número de circuitos de
actividad. Lo que ustedes estarán haciendo es contribuir a la implementación de
algunas estaciones de actividad (limitados por el espacio y la corta duracion
de este proyecto -4 meses).
Durante
este lapso enfocaremos nuestros esfuerzos para alimentar la necesidad de
nuestros niños de recibir la adecuada presión desde afuera de modo que ellos
puedan conocer, acoger y cultivar sus propias presiones provenientes de su
interior y su propiocepción.  Esto equivale a ir desarrollando el cableado del CONTROL y su
AUTONOMIA. 



ABOUT OUR PERKS
In this campaign a perk is a task to which an amount of money has been assigned to be able to realize it in real time. And knowing you made that task possible -that your contribution allowed us to complete it- becomes your PERK. 
And I want to let you know my pledge to you: for every PERK you commit yourself to you will be acknowledged with a graphic documentation of what we did with your money during this 4 month period. Thank you!
En esta campaña un perk es una tarea a la cual se le ha asignado un monto de dinero para poder realizarla en tiempo real. Y el hecho de que sepas que tu contribución fue la que la hizo posible la convierte en un PERK para ti. 
Y quiero hacerles saber mi promesa para ustedes: para cada PERK con el que se comprometan recibirán nuestro reconocimiento mediante una documentación gráfica de lo que hicimos . Gracias!

BUDGET
So when summing up all the amounts assigned to the PERKS we get a grand total $9,400 dollars for the 4 months duration of the project. Which can be broken down to a monthly assignment of  $2,350 dollars. I am not including myself in this budget. 

Asi es que, sumando los montos asignados a cada PERK sale un total de $9,400 dolares para la duracion de 4 meses que tiene el proyecto actual. Este monto tambien puede desglosarse en 4 asignaciones mensuales de $2,350 dolares. Yo no estoy incluyendo mis honorarios en este presupuesto. 


BENEFITS


The Climber, the Huaroc, the Zipline, the Platform, the Fireman Pole and the Jumping Bed have all something in common: allow the child the correct scenarios in which to experience his own way of handling amounts of pressure,  novelty, demands, challenges and risks.  The brain tries to give the experience the right pressure according to its nature. The right pressure AWAKENS the brain and fosters the correct wiring to happen. Propioception is the key ingredient in this mix. These activities will not only wire his brain correctly but in the act of doing so they will also provide the opportunities to develop control and autonomy. 
El Trepador, el Huaroc, el Zipline, la plataforma, el tubo de bombero y la cama saltarina tienen todos algo en comun: le permiten al niño contar con los escenarios correctos en los cuales experimentar su propia manera de manejar presion, novedad, exigencias, retos y riesgos. El cerebro trata de darle a la experiencia la presion correcta de acuerdo a SU naturaleza. La presion correcta DESPIERTA al cerebro y promueve el cableado correcto. La propiocepcion es el ingrediente clave aqui. La experiencia en estas actividades no solamente cablearan el cerebro correctamente sino que tambien proveeran las oportunidades para que el niño desarrolle su control y su autonomia.",11.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3>
<p>Dan: Born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Dan received his undergraduate and Master's degrees in architecture from Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana. It was during his summers between classes that he discovered a passion for reclaiming materials and furniture making as an alternative outlet for design and making. While helping a friend operate a small deconstruction business, they began turning the materials they saved into unique furniture pieces. Now back in Grand Rapids with his wife Katie and son Otto, while also working for a small local architecture firm, Dan started re.dwell to build upon his experiences. re.dwell draws upon the combination of his architectural education and relentless pursuit of new ways to utilize salvaged and reclaimed materials. Dan strives to create innovative designs for modern living, while also preserving the integrity of the reclaimed materials and letting each piece tell its own unique story. </p>
<p>Logan: A native of West Michigan, Logan Zillmer arrived at the medium of conceptual photography after years of interest in documentary-style photography and after a few false starts attempting to get films made. A graduate of film school and passionate film enthusiast, Zillmer, with an abundance of creative energy that desperately needed an outlet, undertook a 365 day photo project that produced a published image every day for a year. The project is notable for producing Zillmer’s signature style of experimental, surrealist conceptual photography that has garnered international interest and recognition. Combing complex in-camera techniques with a self-taught mastery of Photoshop, Zillmer’s images recall the compositions of Magritte, as well as influences from Chaplin and Teun Hocks, reconstituted for the modern American experience. Zillmer lives with his wife Whitney and two children, Rowan and Charlie, in Grand Rapids, MI.</p>

<div>My daughter Morgan was diagnosed in 2008 with Cohen Syndrome and I was devastated with the unknown of what to expect for her future.

Highbrook Lodge was the first camp built in the United States for the visually impaired and blind.  The campground has an air-conditioned hall, heated outdoor swimming pool, outdoor bowling alley, recreation field, marked hiking trails and playgrounds.  Activities include arts and crafts, campfires, chess, music and nature and outdoor education.</div>
<div>This venue provides education for parents and a camp opportunity for the kids that would not get this experience otherwise. Families meet with professionals while the children participate in a safe and fun environment with camp counselors. This event often is the only chance for a family to meet other parents and children of Cohen Syndrome.

Our Families will need to spend funds on travel expenses to get to the conference from all over the world and we need your help. 

If we do not meet our goal all funds raised for this project with be used to reduce  costs for registration fees for the conference.
    The Impact  This experience is life changing for our families as often they have not met another Cohen Syndrome child.  
Our kids get to enjoy a fun camp experience in a safe environment and meet with peers that understand them.
We are committed to medical research to help our families and this conference has connected families with researchers that will make a difference for future families. 
We are currently involved with the International Neutropenia registry and the Face Base project as they both are following Cohen Syndrome cases.

Other Ways You Can Help

 We know there are other Cohen Syndrome children that are not diagnosed and we need to raise awareness for this rare disease.
We are also looking for media exposure and hope a celebrity will take an interest that would promote awareness for Cohen Syndrome.

Please help kids like my daughter Morgan, and share our story.

<p><b>Funds Needed</b></p>
<p>The specific goal of this campaign is to
reach 300 to 350 nursing schools across Africa. At an average of $1,500 per
shipping, we will need up to $500,000 for the project. A little fraction of the
funds will be used to produce a very nice “ANEP” T-shirt to give to each of you our donors, as a
token of our appreciation for being an important part of this campaign. However,
not reaching our goal of $500,000 will not stop the project; we might only not
be able to reach our target of as many as 300 nursing schools. Nonetheless, we
will still proceed to reach and service as many schools as the funds can cover.
(Note: If you are unable to donate through this website and you would prefer to donate in Naira, use the following Naira account: Bank: UBA, Account Number: 1007269681).</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>You are being invited to take part
in a laudable project indeed. Imagine how many lives we will be touching
together when our efforts have helped thousands of people to become nurses. Not
ordinary nurses, but nurses who have experienced a sound quality of education
simply because you have partnered with us to provide the necessary learning materials for that
purpose. Those kinds of nurses deliver effective programs of health promotion, disease
prevention, and nursing care to their various clients, be it individuals,
families or even communities.</p>
<p>Also, remember that it is now a global world. It is a small world that keeps getting smaller and smaller because of the unprecedented geometric advancements in technology, communication, and travel. That globalization includes and affects healthcare also. Whatever happens to healthcare and its providers in one part of the world rapidly impacts other parts of the world, either for good or for bad, irrespective of physical distance. The current global fight on Ebola is an exemplary case in point. And the point is, any investment we make to foster health care abroad is partly an investment into healthcare in the homeland, ultimately.   </p>ANEP has done this project successfully
for over ten years! We have received letters of appreciation from commissioners of
health and principals of nursing schools. One principal disclosed that the State had just
built his school a new library and the books we shipped to them were the first
and only books on their shelves! A commissioner for health of a State, on
the instruction of the governor, formally received ANEP’s book donation in a video-recorded
ceremony and instructed that a copy of the video and an album of pictures be
couriered to us in the US! So folks, you will indeed be partaking in a project of high
 significance and one that has lots of benefits for its beneficiaries– one that will be very appreciated eternally both by us and by
the recipients.

Also, remember that it is now a global world. It is a small world that keeps getting smaller and smaller because of the unprecedented geometric advancements in technology, communication, and travel. That globalization includes and affects healthcare also. Whatever happens to healthcare and its providers in one part of the world rapidly impacts other parts of the world, either for good or for bad, irrespective of physical distance. The current global fight on Ebola is an exemplary case in point. And the point is, any investment we make to foster health care abroad is partly an investment into healthcare in the homeland, ultimately.   ANEP has done this project successfully
for over ten years! We have received letters of appreciation from commissioners of
health and principals of nursing schools. One principal disclosed that the State had just
built his school a new library and the books we shipped to them were the first
and only books on their shelves! A commissioner for health of a State, on
the instruction of the governor, formally received ANEP’s book donation in a video-recorded
ceremony and instructed that a copy of the video and an album of pictures be
couriered to us in the US! So folks, you will indeed be partaking in a project of high
 significance and one that has lots of benefits for its beneficiaries– one that will be very appreciated eternally both by us and by
the recipients.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

supported by the Clinton Global Initiative and the Hult International
Business School, is the planet’s largest student competition that
gives the winner a US$ 1 million prize in seed capital.
Easy, affordable and fun. A game-changing solution to early childhood education. 
Adinkra is
an informal portable school that uses pedagogical magic
tricks to develop children's
multiple intelligences. With less than one dollar, parents and care takers from
urban slums around the world will be able to give boys and girls the same stimulation
they would have if they attended expensive formal schools.





No bigger than a matchbox





Divided into 4 different boxes, separated by age groups, the Adinkra Magic Box contains a wide range of fun activities that use pedagogical
magic tricks to spark the curiosity that children need for learning.
The custom boxes stimulate specific multiple
intelligences in different age groups (0 to 2; 2 to 4; 4 to 5; and 5 to 6 year
olds).

Adinkra is an informal portable school



Children love magic!





The benefits of
using magic pedagogically are noticed in different studies, for example magic develops
communication, sequencing, critical thinking, problem solving and increases attention
span of children.

Each Adinkra
Box has 10 magic tricks that will enhance the learning process in a very
interactive way. A visual and colorful user guide will make it easy for anyone to learn how to perform the tricks and amaze children!
The boxes are
aimed at fathers, mothers and care takers, who will be empowered to play with
their kids and, at the same time, be their informal teachers.
 Ten million children impacted by 2020
Adinkra can easily reach millions of people, transforming the learning process into a tangible and visual educational experience.
The company's business model relies on local micro-franchises that will receive and distribute the Adinkra Magic Boxes to shops and grocery stores in vulnerable areas. 



Operating at full potential, Adinkra will sell each box for US$ 0.95 and will be able to impact more than 10 million children in urban slums in Latin America, Africa and Asia.


You can help us meet this goal
We count on your support to bring Adinkra to the whole world.

Summary 4/25


Make direct/impactful no waste relief for Nepal. The Love Hope Strength Foundation started our journey of saving lives one concert at a time with a wild idea to hike and perform the highest concert ever on land at Mt Everest. At the beginning of LHS is Everest Rocks.  The event where we took a team of international musicians and supporters to climb
the mountain and raise money to help support the 
Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and their amazing people and country. The many events following are because of the love hope and strength we felt in Nepal as hikers conquered fears and we accomplished our goals of building this charity. Nepal has a special place in our foundation and we are determined to help raise funds and act as support and connectors to giving entities and other relief partners looking to help the desperate needs of the beautiful Nepalese people and amazing country of Nepal. 


LHS has previously supported projects in Nepal. We intend to act as a trusted conduit and connector to support the disaster relief efforts in Nepal, helping to make the most direct impact possible for your funds with no waste.

Risks & Challenges facing Nepal   This is just the beginning, by the time this is over there will be thousands dead,  thousands homeless and many of the beautiful temples and monuments that make this country so amazing, destroyed.  We've gotten word that the Bhaktapur area of Kathmandu,  the area where our support cancer center is located was hit hard.  The infrastructure of hospitals in Nepal are almost non-existent on a good day; they keep hand sanitizer under lock and key much less having access to enough antibiotics or other basic necessities.  This is all going to be magnified plus the loss of their own income as travel slows down and rebuild begins.

My name is Ashley and in 2012 I traveled to Nepal for over a month.  I immediately fell in love with the beautiful people and culture of Nepal.  While in Pokhara, I met and began working with the Women's Skill Development Organization.  Over the past two years I have been working with the women directly by bringing their beautiful handwoven goods to America. 

My personal connection to Nepal makes me feel compelled to help now more than ever.

 Pokhara, and the surrounding villages were impacted the most severely by the earthquake.  And because of the mountainous terrain, many of the small villages are hard, if not impossible, to reach. My goal is to raise funds that will go directly the women of the Women's Skill Development Organization who are assisting those suffering in these villages.  


  What We Need & What You Get  I am aiming to raise $2,500 to go directly to the Women's Skill Development Organization in Pokhara, Nepal. 

The funding will be put towards food, water, medical supplies, blankets, tents.

<p>Did you know that only 20% of the US adult population are passionate about what they do for work? According to Gallup surveys, fewer that 1 in 3 American workers are committed to the success of their organizations and a shocking 52% of American workers are disengaged and not willing to do any more than necessary to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>In a outdated educational system that is having a hard time keeping up with our changing work culture, with fewer jobs and higher demand for creativity and an entrepreneurial mindset, our young people are caught in the middle and often become disenfranchised, disengaged and disconnected.</p>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Pathways to Success for Youth Curriculum helps to improve school culture, increase academic engagement and motivation and supports healthy decision making by raising self esteem and connection and teaching students to connect with their passions, unique purpose and personal vision of success while providing the tools and strategies to break through limiting beliefs and overcome obstacles so that they can reach their fullest potential. </span></div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This work teaches the tools and techniques to identify, reframe, and clear subconscious blocks and barriers and allows them to connect with their inner selves and others from a heart centered place guided by love, compassion, and joy all while learning how to take 100% responsibility for their thoughts, words and actions. Setting goals, developing action plans, creating support systems and  accountability and masterminding networks put students on the path to success, however they choose to define it.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This content has the potential to transform youth, adults, families, workplaces, communities and the world!

<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Pathways to Success: From the Start</b></span></h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jack Canfield, former high school history teacher, co-author of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series and America's success coach, has been teaching the principles outlined in his book, Success Principles: How to Get From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be, to adults interested in personal development, leadership development and business success. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This work is a compilation of over 30 years of research, experience and powerful content including activities, strategies, exercises, tools and techniques designed to build self esteem, manage stress, overcome limiting beliefs, expand creativity and harness the power of the brain and the heart to create a life of passion, purpose and success, however we choose to define it. In addition, this powerful work provides participants with the foundation necessary to successfully pursue entrepreneurial businesses and collaborations and increase joy and happiness in all aspects of their personal and professional lives.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Recently he announced his commitment to train 1,000,000 trainers around the world with this work. Trish and the Pathways Youth Team fully support this vision.</span></p>
<p>Trish was first introduced to Jack Canfield's Success Principles work at a live event in August 2010 when she attended as part of her plan to leave youth service work and get back on a career path where she could increase her income. But after the very first day of the training, she found herself going back to her hotel room and incorporating The Success Principles into the health curriculum and peer education programs she was already teaching to local youth through the White Mountain Community Health Center's community outreach education program. This continued every day for the 7 day event. Each day in the training room she kept asking herself, ""Why aren't we teaching this to our kids?""and each night she went back to her room and incorporated what she had learned into her lesson plans.  Before long, Trish realized that she was a long way off from her original intent to explore a new career path for herself, but rather she was fully committed to bringing this work to young people.</p>
<p>The more she learned about how powerful subconscious limiting beliefs are in blocking us from what we want to accomplish in life, she began to see how the young people she worked with could benefit from mastering the power of beliefs to create the life of their dreams. Trish knew in her heart and soul that she was onto something and the passion for this work has not subsided.</p>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the August of 2014, after a very successful fundraising campaign grossing a total of $9800 in donations for the Pathways to Success Youth Project, Trish brought a team of young people ages 15-24 to an intense success principles training with Jack Canfield so she could begin to expand her work in the schools as well as begin to train teachers, youth service providers and youth leaders in the model. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the Fall of 2014, Trish, along with her youth team, piloted a full two week curriculum in high school health classes. The feedback from her students was overwhelming and Trish had no doubt that she needed to pursue her vision for expansion.</span></li>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Trish is currently working with key local, state, regional and national stakeholders to develop a funding plan to fully develop the curriculum and a teacher training program to prepare for further expansion.

<h4><b>The Impact</b></h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Over the years of working with young people in the Mount Washington Valley, Trish has noticed that lack of connection, limiting beliefs about what's possible and lack of a vision for the future seem to be connected to a lack of motivation, low self esteem, decreased academic engagement and increased risk behavior, including substance use and unintended pregnancy. </span></p>
<p>In addition to providing proven success principles, this curriculum teaches the tools and techniques to identify, reframe and clear the subconscious blocks and barriers that hold us back from reaching our full potential while communicating from a heart centered place where we easily connect to ourselves and others, thus enhancing connection and collaboration.</p>
<p>This work helps to improve academic engagement, increase motivation, support healthy decision making and helps students connect with their unique purpose and personal vision of success and so they can reach their fullest potential. </p>
<p>Students participate in exercises, experiential activities and projects that help them develop personal assets and self esteem while they learn effective stress management and communication skills as well as success principles that will ultimately serve the workforce, employers and entrepreneurial endeavors.</p>
<p>This curriculum can support our young people by reducing unintended pregnancy, enhancing academic success, and reducing substance use in teens by giving them the tools to clear subconscious blocks to success and connect with themselves and others from a heart centered place guided by love, compassion and joy while also learning how to take 100% responsibility for their thoughts, words and actions, set goals and develop action plans.</p>
<p>The Success Principles teach practical tools, skills and the mindset necessary to be creative employees or successful entrepreneurs in today's changing workforce. At the same time, more connected and engaged youth means less substance use, less unintended pregnancy, less court involvement, less bullying, less violence ... and ultimately less money spent on society's problems and a more solid investment in our future.

</div></div>","Pathways Addresses the Big What Ifs What if our young people had the skills, tools, and confidence to overcome their greatest challenges and the ability and desire to take 100% responsibility for their lives and their future? 
What if they learned to:



reframe limiting beliefs about what's possible in their lives
create a vision for their future
overcome lack of motivation
enhance self esteem
increase academic engagement
set goals and implement action plans to reach them
make healthy choices around risky behavior that may lead to substance abuse, unintended pregnancy, court involvement (the things that cost society lots of money!)

What if our young people had the skills, tools and strategies to choose and engage in work that supports the vision they hold for their future?


What if  businesses, families and communities could benefit from a generation of work-ready, service oriented youth with the skills, tools and drive to live their full potential?
What if our young people could support their own kids in doing the same?
And what if you took advantage of one of our perks that provides a sample of our work and a tool that could help you make a shift in your life TODAY!
That's what Pathways to Success for Youth is all about ... tapping into human potential and transforming our collective future.

""Needles & Scratch""- a web based puppet musical show for preschoolers. The hip hop duo interact with young viewers to help them learn about counting, literacy, shapes and patterns through a played based curriculum. 


Needles & Scratch explore a single topic in each episode, e.g. ""Boogie Books,"" ""Alphabet Blues,"" and ""Dancing Bananas,"" through songs and short storylines.               The show also encourages viewers to move along with and dance with the characters in the program. 



Character's of the Show

Needles - (Lead Mc) a fun loving puppet who enjoys play games, reading books and singing songs. Dancing is one of the favorite things that Needles love to do when Scratch plays a beat.



Scratch - (DJ) Scratch loves to play music on his turntables. He's the younger brother of Needles and he loves to have fun. Scratch is a huge ball of energy and loves to learn new things.

Needles Needs Your HELP!
 

How can You help Needles?
We need your help to get Scratch and to continue production on the series. We've already invested over five thousand dollars into the art/design of the show creating  what we feel is a great learning tool for teachers and parents for their young one's.
Music is the universal language for all cultures of different back grounds and with your help the Needles & Scratch series will help to educate young viewers through a play based musical curriculum.


Check out the Perks! They're geared for both kids & Adults
Reaching the entire goal would be wonderful but if we don't we'll still produce a few episodes with what was raised. 
Where does the funds go?

  Why Play-Based Learning? 






The Needles & Scratch web-series will guide young viewers through their adventures with a play-based curriculum. Research shows that play-based learning leads to greater
social, emotional, and academic success. 



  Play helps to shape the structural design of the brain. Play provides active exploration. Allows children to identify, negotiate, take risks and create meaning. 
Developed memory skills
Engages both Child and adult interactions in active play
Problem solving
Enhancing his or her innate curiosity and creativity. 








""Children can build relationships, learn to resolve conflicts, negotiate and regulate their behaviours. In play, children usually have increased feelings of success and optimism as they act as their own agents and make their own choices. Playing is a known stress release; it is often linked to child wellbeing."" 

                                                                                      - Early Childhood Australia


""Play lies at the core of innovation and creativity. It
provides opportunities for learning in a context in
which children are at their most receptive. Play and
academic work are not distinct categories for young
children, and learning and doing are also inextricably
linked for them.""





                                     -Ontario Full Day Early Learning Kindergarten
Program, 2010

""In play, children represent and transform the world
around them, providing other children and adults with
a window into their thoughts and perceptions, and
often helping adults to see the world in new ways.""                                                                                     -BC Early Learning Framework, 2008

""Play expands intelligence, stimulates the imagination,
encourages creative problem solving, and helps
develop confidence, self-esteem, and a positive
attitude toward learning.""
                                                                                  -Dr. Fraser Mustard 





   Programming For The Whole Family   We understand the challenges that parents have when choosing quality programming for their youngsters and that is why we want to make this show.  With over 15 years in broad cast video production we are more then qualified in producing a fun tool for educating young viewers.
Collaborating with teachers and parents on creative concepts. 
 Involving kids in the brainstorming phases. 
And above all, always having fun because learning should be fun!

And now I came across an obstacle called TUITION. Coming from a family where I've been financially supporting myself since I was 16, but still tried to save up just to go to this school someday, this is currently based on ""Alice in Wonderland"".

Here are just some calculations: 

Tuition: $29.900 (per year)
Rent: $10.000 (per year - food NOT included)

I think that says it. 

Everything I raise will be spent for tuition. (student loan is still unavoidable). I will post regular videos, updates to keep in touch with you.

And I would be grateful for the rest of my life if this becomes a walking/talking realization. Because I WILL take the best out of it and use it for my future.

<h3>The Story and Vision</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Hi! My name is Rachel Stark. I am a full time college student with a passion for humanitarianism and global change, and I am looking for your support to take the next step.</span></p>
<p>Presently, I am double majoring in Communications with an emphasis on Practical and Professional Ethics as well as Collaborative and Community Health. When I am not in class, I am working full time as an ambassador at my college, supporting students in claiming their education and achieving their academic goals.</p>
<p>The next step in my education is <i><b>The Art of Leadership Mastery Program</b></i> offered through <i>The Institute for Embodied Wisdom.</i> ALM is a seven month intensive study lead by Scott Coady - expert in leadership, collaboration, team dynamics and <b>developer of a leadership training program for NASA.</b></p>
<p>The ALM program is an ideal catalyst for me to share my vision with confidence and fortitude. <b>My vision for the future is a world that systemically operates from the fundamental unifying principles of humanity, that wellness finds legitimacy in society, and that the public has more representation in democracy than private interest. </b>I see a world of peace and security, grounded in the transformative potential of the human heart. I am dedicating my life to becoming a champion of this vision in the most grounded, applicable, and effective ways.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What is The Art of Leadership Mastery?</h3>
<p><span>ALM offers education in self awareness and group orientation. These are key for current leadership and creating the space, presence, and culture to build leadership and authenticity as fundamental principles that navigate our lives, both personally and professionally.</span></p>
<p>The Elements of Curriculum for this program include:</p> <ul> <li>Setting and achieving goals that are aligned with one's vision</li> <li>Developing an authentic and engaging leadership presence</li> <li>Inspiring collective actions despite perceived limitations<br/>
</li>
<li>Somatic fundamentals for a strong, confident body</li>
<li>Engaging and mobilizing others to accomplish great things</li>
<li>Making difficult decisions with certainty while upholding values</li>
<li>Self accountability and collective responsibility</li>
<li>Creating effective and capable teams</li>
<li>Generating higher levels of trust and relationship with others</li>
</ul>
<div>
<span>I believe this curriculum is imperative to my evolution. It will further my understanding of what is required in the cultivation of a clear, confident and heart-centered presence necessary to become a leader for positive global change while mobilizing others in the process.</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding?</h3> <p>As of right now, these types of specialized leadership skills and awareness training  programs are not offered at the college I am attending. <b>Because of my dedication and commitment, Scott and his team have already awarded me $7,500 in scholarships! With your help, I can raise the additional $5,000 needed for tuition. </b>The additional $500 listed is to compensate for the fees withdrawn by Indiegogo.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span>My devotion is to work with organizations, corporations and governments to develop and implement solution-based systems for the world.

<strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Garden</strong><br/>
</div>
<p>The Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden Program helps narrow the achievement gap for participating inner city students. The Garden
Teaching  program uses experiential learning opportunities that help students deepen
their education while also providing a service to the community.  Service
Learning and the Integrated Garden Curriculum set the Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden apart from other garden teaching and other rooftop gardens.</p>
<p>Programming is conducted by Bryna
Bass, an educator with 18 years of experience, who develops lesson plans and
calendars, pairing activities and lesson guides that are
relevant to each of the grades at Rothenberg.  She's also responsible for overall garden maintenance
and updating the lessons yearly as standards are revised at the state level.</p>
<p>The Rooftop Garden is an
innovative model in which academic standards required at each grade level are
integrated thoroughly with garden-based lessons. The Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden
serves as a community gathering place and a point of pride in this historic
inner city neighborhood.  Lessons in sustainability and container
gardening will be taught across the generations and help advance the community
as a whole toward better nutrition, more healthy ways of eating, and
close-to-the source food production.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the projected 30 year
lifetime of the garden we estimate 16,500 or more inner city children and their
families will be educated and served. The Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden will
educate and influence 550 Rothenberg School children annually and into the

</div>","The Garden

The Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden Program helps narrow the achievement gap for participating inner city students. The Garden
Teaching  program uses experiential learning opportunities that help students deepen
their education while also providing a service to the community.  Service
Learning and the Integrated Garden Curriculum set the Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden apart from other garden teaching and other rooftop gardens.
Programming is conducted by Bryna
Bass, an educator with 18 years of experience, who develops lesson plans and
calendars, pairing activities and lesson guides that are
relevant to each of the grades at Rothenberg.  She's also responsible for overall garden maintenance
and updating the lessons yearly as standards are revised at the state level.
The Rooftop Garden is an
innovative model in which academic standards required at each grade level are
integrated thoroughly with garden-based lessons. The Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden
serves as a community gathering place and a point of pride in this historic
inner city neighborhood.  Lessons in sustainability and container
gardening will be taught across the generations and help advance the community
as a whole toward better nutrition, more healthy ways of eating, and
close-to-the source food production.


Over the projected 30 year
lifetime of the garden we estimate 16,500 or more inner city children and their
families will be educated and served. The Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden will
educate and influence 550 Rothenberg School children annually and into the
future, as well as their families, teachers, school administrators, and OTR
community members.
The Rooftop School Garden addresses the need for inner city children to engage with the natural
environment first-hand to realize the importance of preservation and

state academic standards. This is the unduplicated impact our Rooftop School Garden Program offers Rothenberg children and their community.
Additionally, through Service
Learning activities associated with the Rothenberg Rooftop School Garden, we can facilitate
better learning for students; provide
free resources to engage students and improve their educational outcomes; and create
a culture of care where all citizens are active members of their community.Over-the-Rhine FoundationSince 1992, Over-the-Rhine Foundation has focused on preserving and promoting OTR's livability.

Our GOAL 

We believe that the way to build community is to make sure that everyone can participate.  It cost over $52,000 to offer our youth activities this year, not everyone could participate, and we weren't able to do everything we wanted to do.

We want to raise $15,000 that will go to:

1. Scholarships for fabulous (but sometimes expensive) events so that everyone can participate, like the LIFE-CHANGING 8th grade LA trip and other AWESOME Bay Area activities
(like Bowling, Exploratorium, Warriors game, Laser Tag, House of Air, Petaluma
Pumpkin Patch, GG Park, Six Flags etc.) 


2. New events for all ages (CRuSTY Social Justice-SF, ski trip, HIGH-ENERGY activities for 1st-6th graders) . . . we have a list of dreams . . . it all depends on how much we can raise!



And CRuSTY is growing!  This year more than 250 kids came to over 35 events including our FAMOUS Chocolate Seder, MENCHY Mitzvah Day, ACTION-PACKED PJ parties, LAUGHING late night hangouts and more.  The impact on kids in the youth group has been amazing, and it is just the beginning.

</div><p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. As a retired special education high school teacher, and current mobile application and website developer, I would like to conduct technology training classes to help young adults with disabilities learn to develop mobile applications and websites at NO COST to them. In addition, at the completion of the class they will receive a laptop loaded with all the training and development software they will need, freelance accounts with services such as Odesk &amp; Elance, and registered developer accounts with Apple, Google and Microsoft. My target students are those who were very high functioning in high school, but due to lack of ability to access the curriculum, or their social skills, their school was not able to give them a proper preparation for their post-secondary education, they were not able to get into college to continue their education. </p><p>When I retired from teaching, I created a storefront technology training center where I conduct classes for adults on how to use mobile devices such as iPads, iPhones, Android and Windows 8 devices. Our Technology Lounge also provides website development and Home Cyber Defense Services. My hope is to be able to provide classes  for teaching these special young people technology skills for a productive and successful career in the development field. The classes will meet at least twice a week and last the length of a typical semester. I would keep the classes small, no more then 3 to students at a time, so the students would get receive an abundance of individual assistance. The goal of the program if fully funded would be to have a minimum of 12 students successfully complete the program in 2015. After successful completion of the course each student would be awarded with their own laptop, Apple, Google &amp; Microsoft developer accounts, and Odesk &amp; Elance accounts if they have the desire to Freelance instead of make their own products. (All my students will have to be out of high school and over 18.) I will ask any young adults interested in these classes to submit an application, and they will be interviewed and selected based on their ability to successfully complete the training program. Since the classes will be offered to them for free, I will be looking for students who truly have to drive to learn the material and the interest in computer programming to make it their lifelong career. </p><p>My timeline is to have everything in place so I may begin my first class in May. I anticipate the cost of providing each student their own laptop, training &amp; development software, accounts with freelance services, and registering them as developers to be $2,000 per student. (The students completing my program would basically be able to to start their own development business with no out of pocket expenses.) The program will start in May regardless of how much is raised, we simply will adjust the numbers of students who will be able to participate to the success of the fundraising. </p><p>Once again, thanks for your time, and I hope you can see fit to help me make this dream become a reality for these young adults.</p><p><b>Biography</b>:</p><p>To give you a brief background on myself, after spending 16 years as a special education teacher on a high school campus, my first experience with an iPad in 2010 led me on a journey of discovery and professional reinvention as a mobile app developer.

What Is Egyptian Streets ? 


Egyptian Streets is an independent, young, and grassroots media organization aimed at providing fast-paced and free coverage of events that occur on streets in Egypt and across the region.
   Our Goal 
By establishing an engaging social platform for readers to not only gain knowledge but to also discuss and interact with the content, Egyptian Streets’ goal is to drive social change, educate and form a media outlet that is independent during a time when press freedom in the Middle East is restricted.

Achievements The achievement came just one year after Egyptian Streets was officially founded.


As of February 2015, Egyptian Streets is the number one Independent English media outlet in Egypt by reach. 


In one year, 150,000+ comments on social media



More than 1.5 million people reached on Facebook per month



More than 800,000 visitors by February 2015.



How We Are Different 

Today, most large news media organizations are old, traditionally served, and bloated platforms that fail to engage with readers and to touch on the issues which have the deepest impacts. By engaging with a wide spectrum of the community – from bloggers, activists, academics and more – and offering solutions to various socio-political, economic and cultural issues, Egyptian Streets manages to provide a much more unique and diverse perspective on the region by ensuring the conversation continues offline as well as online.
As of January 2015, Egyptian Streets has partnered with a variety of causes and organisations, including Egypt’s first exhibition for the corporate travel sector, AIESEC, UNDP and others.
Egyptian Streets has also collaborated with numerous non-governmental organizations and activist groups to promote a variety of social issues, including poverty, women’s issues, racism, environmental issues, animal rights, education and more. These collaborations, which have often included the featuring of these organizations’ causes, are aimed at driving social change through the promotion of grassroots movements.

<p>Help SAVE the Historic Hanging Flume! Protect the
Places and Stories it Tells for Future Generations.</p>
<p><b>What
is the Hanging Flume?</b><span>In western Colorado, an
engineering marvel of a bygone era clings to sheer canyon walls along seven
miles of the Dolores River. The Hanging Flume was built in the 1880s to divert
water for gold mining, but the exact method of its construction remains a
mystery. How was this immense engineering work completed in such a remote
location in just a few years? No written accounts or photographs of its
construction exist and time is running out to document the remaining pieces of
this fascinating and unique structure. We want to answer the question, “how did
they do that?” before valuable clues to the flume’s construction are lost
forever. <b>Your contribution will help the <a href=""http://wcinterp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Interpretive Association of Western Colorado</a> (IAWC) send a team of engineers, historians, wood scientists and rope access experts
to explore and document remaining portions of the flume.</b></span></p>
<p>The Hanging Flume is the most intact structure of
its kind in the United States, and it is the only hanging flume in a condition
suitable for preservation, education and interpretation. It illustrates the
ingenuity and fortitude of the engineers and miners intent on extracting gold
from the land. The Hanging Flume is a historically significant cultural
resource recognized by:</p>

<p><b>Time
is Running Out to Document the Flume</b></p>
<p>The Hanging Flume is deteriorating as a result of
the ongoing effects of exposure to the elements, falling debris and rock

the time is now to investigate and document remaining sections before the
evidence is gone forever. Previous expeditions have documented approximately 10
percent of the remaining sections of the Hanging Flume. At each location,
different construction configurations were discovered. The urgency for
conducting this project now is that undocumented segments may contain key
information on the construction of the Flume that will be lost as the
130-year-old structure continues to deteriorate.</p>

Montrose County. Previous expeditions have documented about 10 percent of the
flume, and a 48-foot segment of the flume has been reconstructed to demonstrate
what the flume would have looked like in the 1880s. Documenting additional
sections of the flume will lead to a better understanding of the techniques and
technology utilized in its construction. In turn, this documentation will help
historians and engineers to better understand and preserve other historic mining, logging and ranching structures.  The history

<p></p><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4>How privilege we are, and we may sometimes forget it. For me a way to give back is to volunteer hands-on, the offering of my skills and energy to the best of my abilities for the highest good and the development of others, by having in return the genuine satisfaction of doing so. Besides, I always have the intention to go the extra mile.<br/><br/>Therefore, I have decided from August 2015 and for 12 weeks that I will volunteer in ‘Rocinha’ one of the largest and poorest ‘favela’ or ‘barrio’ communities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to official state numbers, 22% of the people in Rocinha lives under the poverty line (1.25$ a day as The World Bank established). <br/><br/>The 3 million plus inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro's favelas face overwhelming challenges every day; as fierce unemployment, unsanitary living conditions, lack of health care / pre-natal care, malnutrition, poor drinking water, educational shortfalls, drugs, domestic abuse, homelessness, and the list goes on and on. <br/><br/>During 12 weeks, I will join the Project Favela’s team as a facilitator for learning; I hope to contribute with enthusiasm, excellence and loving.

INTRODUCTIONHow privilege we are, and we may sometimes forget it. For me a way to give back is to volunteer hands-on, the offering of my skills and energy to the best of my abilities for the highest good and the development of others, by having in return the genuine satisfaction of doing so. Besides, I always have the intention to go the extra mile.Therefore, I have decided from August 2015 and for 12 weeks that I will volunteer in ‘Rocinha’ one of the largest and poorest ‘favela’ or ‘barrio’ communities of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to official state numbers, 22% of the people in Rocinha lives under the poverty line (1.25$ a day as The World Bank established). The 3 million plus inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro's favelas face overwhelming challenges every day; as fierce unemployment, unsanitary living conditions, lack of health care / pre-natal care, malnutrition, poor drinking water, educational shortfalls, drugs, domestic abuse, homelessness, and the list goes on and on. During 12 weeks, I will join the Project Favela’s team as a facilitator for learning; I hope to contribute with enthusiasm, excellence and loving. This NGO is a small Rio based initiative and after communicating with Scott Miles (the founder and president), I am incredibly excited by what lays ahead. Project Favela will place me together with a team of 15 volunteers to challenge myself and put me to my best use for the community I am immersed in, activities range from project coordination, training volunteers, English-Spanish classes, sports, culture and arts. No two days will be the same and I will really have to ""roll up my sleeves"" to make sure I do the best I can.WHAT WE ARE FUNDING FOR:The crowdfunding target is 1600 USD, of the funds you raised: * $1100 = 3450 BRL = 990 EUR = 7400 DKK donation + anything over the target will go to Project Favela initiative and the volunteer home that houses the volunteers.* $500 = 1560 BRL = 445 EUR = 3330 DKK travel expenses from Santiago (SCL), Chile to Rio Janeiro Intl (GIG), Brazil.OTHER WAY YOU CAN HELP: Please spread the word!!!

<br/><h3>Community Culture Change, Inc.</h3>
<div>Hello!<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>My name is Bryan Marquez and I'm one of the founding members of Community Culture Change, Inc., or C3 for short. We're a nonprofit that engages the community through project-based works. The goal of our projects is to get members of the local community involved and connected with one another.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Our first project, Accelerate Tutoring, was created to address LAUSD's budget cuts to tutoring programs. As a free tutoring center for the local community, we brought passionate tutors to students who were in need of one-on-one tutoring. We started off our first week with two students registered, and we ended the 2015 school year with 30 students enrolled in our program!<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>Currently, we're looking to raise funds for tech equipment that will allow us to incorporate new curriculum and keep better metrics of student progress. With these upgrades, we'll be able to open up our program to additional elementary schools and have a greater impact on the East LA community. </span>

<br/>
<h3>What are our tech upgrades?</h3> <p>In total, we'll need a minimum of $2,500 for the upgrades we'd like to incorporate into our program. Below is a breakdown of the equipment we'll be purchasing:</p> <ul> <li>6 iPads x $250 each = $1500</li>
<li>2 Laptops x $200 each = $400</li>
<li>Bluetooth Mice x 6 = $90</li>
<li>Ticket to Read x 20 accounts = $400</li>
<li>Marketing Costs to Promote Upgrades = $140</li>
<li>Total Amount of Upgrade = $2500</li>
</ul>
<div>These are estimated prices based off the requirements we need to run our curriculum. Of course, if we're able to find a cheaper deal that meets the requirements, we'll go with that deal. We'll use any money that exceeds our goal to either buy more equipment (enabling higher enrollment) or provide a better one-on-one experience for our students. If we are not able to reach our goal, any funds that we're able to acquire will be combined with our own money to purchase said equipment.</div>

Organized by <a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Adventurists</a>, the Mongol Rally launches teams of adventurous people crammed into tiny cars, and sends them on their way from London to Mongolia. Teams and cars have very different age, background and pedigree – but one thing they all have in common is that every single car is designed for a very very different purpose. It's not a race and it doesn't have a prize, the outcome is purely the money raised, and the adventure.<p></p>
<p>In the words of the organizers: ""<i>There’s no backup, no support and no set route; just you, your fellow adventurists and a tiny car you bought from a scrapyard for £11.50"". </i></p>
<p>The rules of the Rally are gloriously simple:</p>
<p>1. You can only take a farcically small vehicle.<br/>2. You’re completely on your own.<br/>3. You've got to raise a £1000 for charity </p>

<p>
<b>The Plan</b></p>
<p>The Rally starts in London, but we will commence our journey in Stockholm, Sweden. From there we will drive to London, and onwards through France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbeikstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia (again) and into Mongolia and Ulan Bator. From there we will do the final push up to Ulan Ude (Russia yet again). If all goes as planned (haha) we will make the journey in roughly 30 days.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<p>Raising money for charity is central to us, ensuring that this adventure will be a positive force that does as much good along the way as humanly possible. Because we are both parents we have selected <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/mongol-rally-2015/edit/www.sos-childrensvillages.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SOS Children's Villages</a> as our charity of choice. As part of the Mongol Rally charity we will also donate £500 to <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/mongol-rally-2015/edit/www.coolearth.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CoolEarth</a>, a charity that works alongside indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction
</p>
<p>Raising money for charity is part of the race, and we are setting our fundraiser bar high. But for that, we need <u>your help</u>.</p>
<p><b>SOS Children's Villages </b>is an established global charity that engages and supports children in many of the countries on our planned route. They are active in 134 countries and territories around the world, working with a single mission: to ensure that every child grows with love, security and respect.<br/></p>

</div></div>","In short We are driving from London to Mongolia in a 1999 Renault Clio, to raise money for SOS Childrens' Villages Disaster Fund (supporting children's well being in disaster struck areas) and CoolEarth (rain forest preservation).
All the money raised here will go straight to charity.



An adventure of the heart


We are supporting a good cause by doing something that many people would label 'insane'. And it is (both a good cause and slightly insane). We’re going to take a small under-powered car, like the one our grannies used to drive, and drive it 14000 kilometers to the other side of the world - to raise money for charity and increase awareness of the importance of supporting child welfare in remote places.




The Rally, The car and the Master Plan

Organized by the Adventurists, the Mongol Rally launches teams of adventurous people crammed into tiny cars, and sends them on their way from London to Mongolia. Teams and cars have very different age, background and pedigree – but one thing they all have in common is that every single car is designed for a very very different purpose. It's not a race and it doesn't have a prize, the outcome is purely the money raised, and the adventure.
In the words of the organizers: ""There’s no backup, no support and no set route; just you, your fellow adventurists and a tiny car you bought from a scrapyard for £11.50"". 
The rules of the Rally are gloriously simple:
1. You can only take a farcically small vehicle.2. You’re completely on your own.3. You've got to raise a £1000 for charity 
Our car


This is Mats and our car, a '99 Renault Clio. It was designed to be an affordable city car with a minimum of extras. What we intend to do with this lovely piece of (French) equipment is the exact opposite of why it was conceived in the first place – driving it a very long distance and taking it way way way out of its' city comfort zone. 

The Plan
The Rally starts in London, but we will commence our journey in Stockholm, Sweden. From there we will drive to London, and onwards through France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbeikstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Russia (again) and into Mongolia and Ulan Bator. From there we will do the final push up to Ulan Ude (Russia yet again). If all goes as planned (haha) we will make the journey in roughly 30 days.

<h2><b>A Little Bit of Background</b></h2>
<p>In 1958, the Chinese government instituted the hukou system, in order to control the influx of people from rural areas into the cities.  Today, the system continues to discriminate against rural residents in favor of urban residents, and whether they stay in rural areas of move with their parents to the cities for better work opportunities, China’s rural children do not have the same access to a quality education as their urban peers. </p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>What Is Stepping Stones? </b></h2>
<p>Stepping Stones is a not-for-profit organization founded in 2006 with a mission to help narrow the educational gap by providing English lessons to rural children in Shanghai’s migrant schools, as well as in rural China. </p>
<p>English is one of the three core subjects in China’s school curriculum, and the one that poses the greatest challenge to rural Chinese teachers. </p>
<p>English level therefore is the biggest differentiator between urban and rural Chinese children, and this perpetuates the gap in educational and employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Shanghai benefits from a large expatriate and local English-speaking community, many of whom are eager for high-impact volunteering opportunities. Stepping Stones was founded to match this rich resource to a real need in the community.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>The Impact </b></h2>
<p>Stepping Stones has around 300 volunteers teaching close to 5000 children in Shanghai every week during the school term in 31 different schools and communities in Shanghai. </p>
<p>Our programs have proven to be effective. Students in a migrant school in Minhang District taught by a volunteer teacher through our program <b>improved their test scores in English by an average of 9%.</b></p>

Thank you for your interest in The India Photography Project! My name is Emily Rose Weinstein, and I am a professional freelance photographer from New York City hoping to empower youth in the slums of India through photography.Back home in the USA, I work with an events company servicing clients such as Google, Facebook, Barclays Capital and Apple. I also have 5+ years of nonprofit experience working at the United Nations, as well as in countries such as India, Ghana and the USA. I am educated in international development and photography. As a graduate of Fordham University, I majored in Anthropology with a dual minor in International Humanitarian Affairs and Visual Arts.


From February-March of 2015, I served as an AJJDC Multi-Week Fellow with Gabriel Project Mumbai. I taught English and world geography in Kalva, creating and facilitating a successful curriculum. Students learned and retained information about the countries of the world, while practicing and improving their spoken and written English. Upon completing my fellowship, I became the first GPM volunteer to be invited back to work with the organization assisting with promotion and marketing, as well as to spearhead the implementation of a photography teaching project in the Kalva slums. While I am thrilled to accept this incredible opportunity, the assignment is largely pro bono work to assist the promotion of GPM and local nonprofits in Mumbai. To make my journey across the world feasible, I am hoping to raise money to cover base travel and living expenses.


The Impact

Supporting my work brings funding to children in need. Ever heard the phrase, ""a picture is worth a thousand words""? Photographic evidence of social programs in action guarantees larger donations for an organization. That means the more images produced, the more images are circulated to spread awareness of a great initiative, increasing funds for that same program.

But these high quality, professional level images have to come from somewhere...I have experience working in these communities already, as well as access to a security team to accompany me into more dangerous areas where other photographers might not want to risk bringing expensive equipment.I want to do more than take photographs; I want to teach children how to tell their own stories, through their eyes. Photography is empowering, and I want to give students the ability to tell the world about the way they live and the things that are important to them. That's why I will be putting my knowledge of international development, marketing and photography to work with GPM to start a photography education program for the students of Kalva. The children will produce their own images using disposable and digital cameras, while learning important lessons on how to convey meaning through imagery. Sharing their work will promote global awareness of poverty and its effect on youth.
This is the start of a much bigger initiative... This isn't a short-term project. Over the course of the summer, I have been meeting with potential funders and supporters in preparation for my return trip to India. If all funding goals for the India Photography Project are met and the learning segment of the project is completed, the next step will be to compile the children's photographs into a book which will be published and sold internationally. All proceeds will benefit the educational programs operating in Kalva....the India Photography Project is the first stage of a nonprofit. The next 6 months are crucial in determining the feasibility and sustainability of The Photography Project. My goal is to reduce the risk of unforeseen obstacles by testing the curriculum in a challenging, yet familiar environment. Once the project is proven successful, I will begin the process of establishing a registered nonprofit to spearhead the implementation of similar endeavors in impoverished communities all over the world.

</h3>Mary Wanjiru Maina, aka Ciru (short for Wanjiru), was born in 1979 in Mathare slum to an alcoholic mother in 1979. At the age of 10 Ciru ran away from home and joined the hundreds of thousands of children who inhabited the streets of Nairobi. ""They preferred the streets to home..."". (New York Times, ""In the Hell 
of  a Nairobi Slum, A Priest Offers Hope, 26th November 1984). Street children in Nairobi in the late 80's and 90's survived by scavenging for food, begging, and getting high from sniffing glue/gasoline. For 3 years this was Ciru's life. <br/><br/>Life on the street came to an end for Ciru when she became one of many children that joined the Undugu Society Street Children Rehabilitation programme. The Society was founded by Father Arnold Grol in 1973; in Father Grol's words the mission of the society was to ""make living more than a matter of existing"" and to empower poor, marginalised and vulnerable people to live life with dignity. <br/><br/>One of the key strategies to achieve this for street children was to place them in schools where they could learn vocational skills that they could utilise to earn a living. Ciru was taken to the Meru Technical Training Institute where she spent 2 years learning to sew. When Ciru left the Training Institute she returned to Nairobi, and began looking for work. <br/><br/>In her search for employment Ciru was drawn to the street food vendors who seemed to earn an enticing income from cooking and selling street food. What was most attractive to Ciru was the food itself, and she narrowed her job search to food related work. Ciru eventually managed to secure work as a kitchen hand in a number of restaurants in Nairobi. It is in these kitchens that Ciru confirmed that her passion was for food: she paid close attention to the way chefs in these restaurants would prepare delicious, tasty, yet simple dishes using inexpensive ingredients. <br/><br/>In between jobs as a kitchen hand, Ciru would market herself as a cook, and managed to secure a number of catering jobs where she was able to put what she had learned as a kitchen hand to practice. With time Ciru became known as the ""go-to-person"" for catering jobs in Mathare. Ciru has built a reputation for herself in Mathare as a cook who can prepare delicious dishes for any number of people with any budget. She has provided catering services to a number of residents both within and outside of Mathare, to a number of churches, and for a number of events including weddings and funerals. <br/><br/>Ciru has come to realise that the catering business is a lucrative option, even for someone who has had limited access to formal education. As Ciru says, in the catering business, all you need to be successful is a passion for food, and a willingness to learn. Ciru is keen to open a School of Cookery in Mathare and offer youth who have a passion for food the opportunity to learn how to make a living doing what they love: to cook. <br/><br/><div>
<p><b>Why a School of
Cookery:</b></p>
<p>As a former street child, Ciru
understands the limited options for advanced learning that are available to
children who grow up in low income neighbourhoods such as Mathare. Whilst the
government of Kenya has extended free primary school education and subsidized secondary school education to all Kenyans,
a number of children remain locked out of the educational system due to a
number of social and economic challenges that they and their families face. 
</p>
<p>Without a secondary school and college/university
education the majority of youth in Kenya are automatically locked out of
employment opportunities in the formal sector. These youth end
up working  as low skilled casual labourers, and will
typically earn an average of KES 8,500.00 ($86.30/£62.96) or less a month for most of their working life. </p>
<p>Ciru's School of Cookery will be an
excellent alternative for youth who are locked out of the advanced educational
system. In the words of Henrietta Inman, a pastry chef in Suffolk (<a href=""http://www.henriettainman.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.henriettainman.co.uk/</a>):
</p>
<p><b><i>“My trade is as a pastry chef
then there are carpenters, ceramicists, jewelers, actors, musicians...
education is obviously extremely important too but I think having a trade/
craft to carry you throughout life is a great attribute and something to be
cherished. If you can realise Ciru's dream and help her create her school,
think of the amount of people who will be able to learn a trade (to be a chef!)
and have it with them for the rest of their lives, earning them a living,
supporting their families and hopefully enjoying it at the same time! It would
be amazing”.</i></b></p>
<p>The food industry is now a
billion dollar industry worldwide, and has been growing rapidly in Kenya. Ciru's
School of Cookery will create a work force of versatile and innovative chefs
who can meet the growing demand for professional chefs within Nairobi, and Kenya at large. </p>
</div>
<p><b>Why Mathare:</b></p>
<p>- 
Mathare is the second largest slum in Nairobi;</p>
<p>- 
Anna Tibaijuka, the former Executive Director for
UN-HABITAT, described Mathare as a neighbourhood <b><i>“where people eke out a living in
life threatening conditions, where the most basic needs are not met for the
majority, and where population growth rates are the highest in Africa. Their
poverty is compounded by many factors such as domestic violence, crime, drugs
and alcoholism, to name a few</i></b>”.</p>
<p>- 
Very few parents in Mathare can afford to send their
children to secondary school. As a result these children are forced to find
work to support themselves and their families. Unfortunately a large number resort to
early marriage, prostitution, drug and alcohol trafficking and other types of
urban crime in an effort to survive in their hostile urban environment. <br/></p>
<p>- There is no Cookery School in Mathare at present.<br/></p>
<p>The picture however is not bleak: hope lives in Mathare.</p>
<p>Residents of Mathare have been
described as “resilient and entrepreneurial”. 
They “have a range of skills that allow them to survive in one of the
most difficult urban environments in East Africa”. </p>Ciru's School of Cookery aims to
tap into this resilient, entrepreneurial spirit, and provide the youth of
Mathare with the opportunity to learn a trade that will allow them not only to
survive, but to thrive in the lucrative food industry. <br/><br/><p>Ciru's School of Cookery will address the following issues:</p>
<p>1.  Lack
of access to higher level education;</p>
<p>2.  Youth
unemployment;</p>
<p>3.  Poverty
and other vulnerabilities that youth in Mathare face on a day to day basis. </p>
<p><b>The Model of the School:</b><br/></p>
<p>In the first year of operation 20 students will attend an intensive 6 month cookery course for a subsidized rate of KES 15,000.00 ($152.28). For those who cannot afford this subsidized fee Ciru's School of Cookery will allocate 6 scholarships in the first year. In addition to this Ciru's School of Cookery will partner with local institutions/organisations who can provide scholarships/bursaries for additional youth to attend the 6 month cookery course. <br/></p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to learn the following: 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>-  Butchery</p>
<p>- Fishmongery</p>
<p>- Hots<br/></p>
<p>- Colds<br/></p>
<p>- 
Pastry &amp; Bakery</p>
<p>Students of Ciru's School of Cookery will also have the opportunity to participate in:

</p>
<p>- 
Sourcing
trips to suppliers</p>
<p>- 
Lectures
from professionals in the food industry</p>
<p>- 
Lectures/practicals on the business aspects of running a successful

</p>
<p>- 
Internships/placements
in a professional kitchen/restaurant in Nairobi </p>
<p>-

<p></p>
<p><b>How will the school sustain itself?</b></p>
<p>The school will double up as a catering company, and income generated from catering contracts will fund the running and operational costs of the School. 
</p>
<p>Teaching and catering duties will be divided as follows:</p>
<p>The Training and Developmental
Chef (T&amp;D Chef): will be responsible for teaching 20 students every year. </p>
<p>Head Chef (Ciru): will be responsible for securing catering
jobs, developing menus for clients and coordinating the T&amp;D Chef and students to cater to events for the residents of
Mathare, residents of surrounding neighbourhoods, corporates and other
individuals/organisations who require catering services. <br/></p>
<p><b>The School as a Social Enterprise:</b></p>
<p>Ciru's School of Cookery will be a social enterprise with a hybrid model where the catering business is for profit, and the school itself is not for profit. <br/></p>
<b>What Ciru Needs:<br/><br/></b>
<p>Ciru is currently trying to recruit financial

as a chef, and in the process empower a generation of marginalized and
vulnerable youth to thrive in the food industry and in
other areas of their lives.</p>

</div>Please hold Ciru's Hand and help her realise her dream to open a School of Cookery in Mathare. <br/></div>","The Story
Mary Wanjiru Maina, aka Ciru (short for Wanjiru), was born in 1979 in Mathare slum to an alcoholic mother in 1979. At the age of 10 Ciru ran away from home and joined the hundreds of thousands of children who inhabited the streets of Nairobi. ""They preferred the streets to home..."". (New York Times, ""In the Hell 
of  a Nairobi Slum, A Priest Offers Hope, 26th November 1984). Street children in Nairobi in the late 80's and 90's survived by scavenging for food, begging, and getting high from sniffing glue/gasoline. For 3 years this was Ciru's life. Life on the street came to an end for Ciru when she became one of many children that joined the Undugu Society Street Children Rehabilitation programme. The Society was founded by Father Arnold Grol in 1973; in Father Grol's words the mission of the society was to ""make living more than a matter of existing"" and to empower poor, marginalised and vulnerable people to live life with dignity. One of the key strategies to achieve this for street children was to place them in schools where they could learn vocational skills that they could utilise to earn a living. Ciru was taken to the Meru Technical Training Institute where she spent 2 years learning to sew. When Ciru left the Training Institute she returned to Nairobi, and began looking for work. In her search for employment Ciru was drawn to the street food vendors who seemed to earn an enticing income from cooking and selling street food. What was most attractive to Ciru was the food itself, and she narrowed her job search to food related work. Ciru eventually managed to secure work as a kitchen hand in a number of restaurants in Nairobi. It is in these kitchens that Ciru confirmed that her passion was for food: she paid close attention to the way chefs in these restaurants would prepare delicious, tasty, yet simple dishes using inexpensive ingredients. In between jobs as a kitchen hand, Ciru would market herself as a cook, and managed to secure a number of catering jobs where she was able to put what she had learned as a kitchen hand to practice. With time Ciru became known as the ""go-to-person"" for catering jobs in Mathare. Ciru has built a reputation for herself in Mathare as a cook who can prepare delicious dishes for any number of people with any budget. She has provided catering services to a number of residents both within and outside of Mathare, to a number of churches, and for a number of events including weddings and funerals. Ciru has come to realise that the catering business is a lucrative option, even for someone who has had limited access to formal education. As Ciru says, in the catering business, all you need to be successful is a passion for food, and a willingness to learn. Ciru is keen to open a School of Cookery in Mathare and offer youth who have a passion for food the opportunity to learn how to make a living doing what they love: to cook. 
Why a School of
Cookery:
As a former street child, Ciru
understands the limited options for advanced learning that are available to
children who grow up in low income neighbourhoods such as Mathare. Whilst the
government of Kenya has extended free primary school education and subsidized secondary school education to all Kenyans,
a number of children remain locked out of the educational system due to a
number of social and economic challenges that they and their families face. 

Without a secondary school and college/university
education the majority of youth in Kenya are automatically locked out of
employment opportunities in the formal sector. These youth end
up working  as low skilled casual labourers, and will
typically earn an average of KES 8,500.00 ($86.30/£62.96) or less a month for most of their working life. 
Ciru's School of Cookery will be an
excellent alternative for youth who are locked out of the advanced educational
system. In the words of Henrietta Inman, a pastry chef in Suffolk (http://www.henriettainman.co.uk/):

“My trade is as a pastry chef
then there are carpenters, ceramicists, jewelers, actors, musicians...
education is obviously extremely important too but I think having a trade/
craft to carry you throughout life is a great attribute and something to be
cherished. If you can realise Ciru's dream and help her create her school,
think of the amount of people who will be able to learn a trade (to be a chef!)
and have it with them for the rest of their lives, earning them a living,
supporting their families and hopefully enjoying it at the same time! It would
be amazing”.
The food industry is now a
billion dollar industry worldwide, and has been growing rapidly in Kenya. Ciru's
School of Cookery will create a work force of versatile and innovative chefs
who can meet the growing demand for professional chefs within Nairobi, and Kenya at large. 

Why Mathare:
- 
Mathare is the second largest slum in Nairobi;
-

life threatening conditions, where the most basic needs are not met for the

poverty is compounded by many factors such as domestic violence, crime, drugs
and alcoholism, to name a few”.
- 
Very few parents in Mathare can afford to send their
children to secondary school. As a result these children are forced to find
work to support themselves and their families. Unfortunately a large number resort to
early marriage, prostitution, drug and alcohol trafficking and other types of
urban crime in an effort to survive in their hostile urban environment. 
- There is no Cookery School in Mathare at present.
The picture however is not bleak: hope lives in Mathare.
Residents of Mathare have been
described as “resilient and entrepreneurial”. 
They “have a range of skills that allow them to survive in one of the
most difficult urban environments in East Africa”. Ciru's School of Cookery aims to
tap into this resilient, entrepreneurial spirit, and provide the youth of
Mathare with the opportunity to learn a trade that will allow them not only to

Emergination Africa is a non profit
organisation with one aim – to develop routes to higher education for youth in
Africa; regardless of circumstance or situation we will assist students to make
a smooth transition to university.

VISION
Our vision is to be the pinnacle global youth organization developing young African students to create opportunities for themselves and for others. 
MISSION
Our mission is to advance Africa's transformation through global skills transfer and educational mentorship.
MOTTO
Mentoring for Africa's youth transformation. 




Students across
Sub-Saharan Africa face many challenges on route to higher education and the
development of skills for the global economy. 
Emergination
Africa recognizes the many barriers and as such has developed routes to higher
education to provide as smooth a transition as
possible, in the face of these challenges. 
The key to a
prosperous future for our youth hinges on the ability to compete on a global
playing field by figuring out the best way to obtain the relevant skills,
knowledge base and networks.



This
crowdfunding campaign has been put together to raise funds for the development
of a series of initiatives which include establishing e-conferencing hubs
(EmergiHubs) on highschool campuses. These programs will allow young
people and their families access to the best educational programmes and will
open the door to opportunities for a productive future. 



If you are
looking for a solution to you or your child’s future education, regardless of
circumstance or situation Emergination Africa are here to help,
by supporting this campaign you will become a part of our community and join us
on our journey to empowering young African students create
opportunities for themselves and for others.
OBJECTIVES
Our Key objectives are:
Goal 1: To mentor high school students to
be college ready and go to college or university


We provide quality peer-to-peer
mentorship on the college application process, thereby making it a reality for
our students to get into the best universities in the world. We do this through
connecting our students to our active network of college students around the
world.

Goal 2: To provide our mentees an
opportunity to network with professionals and college students from various
parts of the world


Our students have the opportunity to
network with professionals from various parts of the world, in particular, the
U.S. through our interactive Emergination E-conferencing Global Careers Panel
sessions. During these sessions students are exposed to various career fields
and what it takes to be successful in those fields
Goal 3: To offer peer-to-peer and
professional career advisement services to high school students in Africa


Students
get the opportunity to learn about various career fields thereby enabling them
to make informed decisions pertaining to degrees they want to pursue in
college.  

Goal 4: To instill an idea of civic
engagement and community impact in students through the implementation of
practical projects in their communities


We challenge and encourage mentees to
actively engage in their communities through various service projects targeted
to impact the greater community and effect positive change.

HOW
WE PLAN TO HELP - THE PROGRAM OVERVIEW Our Program is based on 4 Pillars;
· 
Career Advice and Support
· 
College Application Process
· 
Global Networking
· 
Community Engagement

Through our Emerging Fellows program we connect
high school students to college students and professionals around the world
through bi-weekly one on one video call sessions, panel discussions and project
based learning activities. 
We pride ourselves in providing our students with
the global educational and professional resources that set them apart as
growing global citizens.
THE PROCESS

Under our College Application
Process our students spend a minimum of one hour per week over
video calls with a U.S. college mentor going over curriculum goals
and activities that aid the student in identifying a degree, understanding the
different types of Universities that exist and applying to them. 
In between these sessions mentees also have the
opportunity to talk to University admissions officers to learn more about the
universities and what they look for. 
Through Career Advisement
mentees work with their mentors in developing their resumes, cover letters and
exploring and identifying careers they would be interested in. 
Our Emerging Fellows
Program sessions nurture Global Networking as
students get a chance to network and learn from professionals and college
students in the USA, and other parts of the world.
We put a strong emphasis on our mentees using the
knowledge they have learned to create on campus projects and information
sessions where they impart one or two of our programmatic objectives to the
entire student body, as well as in their communities.Our
Community Development piece enables such interactions. SOME OF OUR SUCCESS STORIES SO FAR...

supports grassroots education projects in the Amazon, Panama, and India to keep
girls and boys in school. While cost of tuition is relatively low, families
with limited resources often have to make tough choices between sending their
kids to school and providing basic necessities. 


According to development research and UN reports, universal education and gender equity are the top two priorities to eradicate global poverty - investing in women is one of the most effective means to reduce poverty in developing countries.

Mona Foundation believes that the key to eliminating poverty and achieving positive community transformation lies in universal education, gender equality, and cultivating the potential of children.



Send Kids Around the World Back to School!

 
It costs an average of $500 to keep one child in school for one year in the Amazon, Panama, and India. This $500 pays for scholarships, uniforms, teacher training, school supplies, and lunches. (That’s just over $40/month.) However, for some families, this is a financial hardship or even an impossibility. Mona Foundation provides support to grassroots educational initiatives all over the world that keep over 75,000 kids in school each year - help us send kids back to school in 2016!

   

Our goal is to provide support for 4 Mona Foundation programs: ADCAM, Badi School, Barli Development Institute for Rural Women, and Digital Study Hall. Each has a proven track record of:


Improving the social and economic life of the community as a whole, with an emphasis on women and girls
Empowering children to become agents of change and community citizens committed to serving humanity
Deeply committed to meeting the long-term needs of their community, with proven records of success 

   


Impact of Universal Education and Gender Equality


Education and gender equality are core strategies of our work because:


In developing countries an extra year of primary school boosts girls’ eventual wages by 10 to 20 percent. An extra year of secondary: 15 to 25 percent. Educated girls grow into educated women, and research shows that they have healthier babies and are more likely to share what they’ve learned with their families, children and communities.
Investing in women is often found to be the most effective means to reduce poverty in developing countries.

Digital Study Hall, headquartered in Lucknow, India, uses “lite tech” and innovative approaches to disseminate video lessons to rural and slum schools. Digital Study Hall’s mission is to improve the quality of education, reaching thousands of disadvantaged children in central India. The best grassroots teachers are filmed as they teach the local state curriculum in their local languages. Lesson videos are shared with poor schools which are given TVs, players and electrical equipment. They also provide programming and training to government girls’ schools and District Institutes of Educational Training (DIETs) to train student teachers.

youth in Palestine/Israel face growing challenges. The loss of hope results in fear, anger and frustration leading to racism and violence. Windows' youth refuse to accept the tension that previous generations have left with them.</p>
<p>They are ready to work towards a future based on justice and equality, living
together or side by side. Last year's support for Windows' enabled them to meet, learn, and develop a courageous blog together. Now, a new generation
of Israeli and Palestinian youth are preparing the Windows Media Program.
The preparation process will allow them to create
perceptions that impact the media. We need your help to make a
difference. Your support will reach thousands of youth who may begin to think in a different way!</p><h4>

a new generation of Windows' youth and begin a two-year empowerment
process to create alternative media and become young leaders in their

two year program, participants remain active in Windows. With their skills and knowledge they will initiate and lead more activities

<h3>The Cause</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hunger, Drugs, Violence, Gangs. </p>
<p>Every day, children in poverty are confronted with experiences and decisions that are well beyond their years, shaping them into a person they shouldn't have to become. They face <b>unspeakable</b> things that no child should ever face. They spend every second of their time fighting away the bad and searching for the good, but without a sense of hope, the moment arrives where it becomes so much easier to lose the thought of a different, brighter future for themselves, so much easier to be recruited into gangs because there's nowhere else to go, so much easier to fall into an even worse situation because there's no one else to turn to for help.</p>
<p>Before this moment can happen, a charitable organization called <b>Toronto Youth Development</b> reaches out their hand and pulls these children out of poverty's grasp. For 20 years, TYD has dedicated its time to being an escape for at-risk youth. </p>
<p>With proper character formation, peer mentoring, access to education, organized sports, many trips, summer and winter camps, and the help of donations to keep it ALL going, Toronto Youth Development has allowed thousands of children and youth to see the potential in themselves, dream big and continue on to a College or University education to open the doors that would otherwise be closed to them. </p>
<h3>The Mission!</h3>

</div></div>","On Australia Day, the Online Hate Prevention Institute (OHPI) is running a campaign to promote positive Australian values such as multiculturalism, religious pluralism and respecting people's dignity, mateship, volunteering, and a commitment to the rule of law. The campaign will also encourage the public to report online racial and religious vilification which goes against our shared values.

About the Campaign
Australia's Shared ValuesWe'll be asking the public to join us in promoting positive messages about Australia in celebration of Australia Day. These messages will re-enforce our shared Australian values on this our national day. Here's a few examples, more and further details about the campaign are available at http://ohpi.org.au/australiaday.





We also have material which shares the thoughts of our Indigenous supporters. For Indigenous Australians, the choice of January 26th as our national day is highly problematic. Read more about this here.

In case we do not reach our fundraising goal, we will use the funds to get as many drones as we can for the existing (or future) members, because we believe in helping our community.    The Impact  This project is important because it helps our future generation prepare in a world where drones are becoming a bigger and bigger resource in business. In return for your help we will post logs of our flights and display our pictures taken by our teen pilots for the world to see.
We will also attempt to team up with the Boys and Girls club to bring drones down to their establishments to have our team members teach other teens outside of our program how to fly a drone.

Our fund is short of PHP68,106.00 (€1,320.00/$1,470.00). We also would want to raise additional funds to make the shelter classrooms as permanent classrooms and rehabilitate what we can.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We are building a classroom for Brgy. Bucana's elementary school. Brgy. 
Bucana, according to information collected from the El Nido municipal office, is
 the poorest among the baranggays (villages) in El Nido, Palawan, Philippines. The school has a
 population of 712 students with only 10 functioning classrooms including 6 condemnable classrooms (that can collapse anytime soon) and 3 temporary shelter classrooms. The baranggay council was asking us to build them 6 classrooms but our budget can only cover
 one. 
   What We Need & What You Get
Max and Elma Koster helped us with our classroom design. The classroom would be wind and typhoon 
resistant and at the same time, easily maintainable. We will be using concrete, wood, and tarpaulin for our structure 
design. 
We started with PHP150,000.00 (€3,000.00/$3,200.00) that Carlos Pampliega fundraised and we have spent PHP45,988.00 (€891.00/$993.00) so far and we have to spend another PHP172,118.00 (€3,335.00/$3,715.00) for materials to finish building the classroom and we only have PHP104,012.00 (€2,016.00/$2,245.00) on hand. Our fund is short of PHP68,106.00 (€1,320.00/$1,470.00). We also would want to raise additional funds to make the shelter classrooms as permanent classrooms and rehabilitate what we can.
For one classroom, these are the things we need and their costs/estimated costs:


We will be sending personalized video messages of the kids saying thank you to the donors and we will make a couple of short videos of the whole process of the project so you, the donors, get to see the progress of the whole building process.

  The Impact

We believe that education is very important and it starts with a nice classroom.This is our second community rehabilitation project.

For 37 years the San Francisco Children’s Art Center has provided classes at Fort Mason Center and around the city with community programs in San Francisco public schools and with children in transitional housing.
Raising this money will allow the art center to keep its doors open.

We are the only non-profit art education center available for children ages 2-10 focusing on a process-oriented art experience.

Our program is inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy which fosters innovative thinking and creativity.
   What We Need & What You Get


The Art Center is facing increased operating costs. We are asking for your generous donation to sustain and develop our programming.

Your donation will allow us to continue to keep our doors open.
It will allow us to improve marketing efforts and develop a sustainable future for the art center.
If the goal is not reached we will lose our home at Fort Mason Center, however, your donation will support our off-site programs in the San Francisco Public Preschools.    The Impact

Since 1978 the San Francisco Children’s Art Center has helped nurture the development and creative growth of thousands of children through imaginative self-expression and child-centered arts learning. 
We have strong community ties and a long history of providing a unique learning experience for children. Saving the art center will help save San Francisco's rich legacy of fostering innovative, engaging learning experiences for the next generation.    Risks & Challenges  In the current economic environment for the arts due to numerous cuts in public funding, we are struggling to raise money to cover our operating costs. We are expanding the board of directors, and this new team is implementing a new model to keep the organization alive.    Other Ways You Can Help  Spread the word. Write a blog post. Talk to local media outlets. Ask your company if they’re interested in matching your donation or sponsoring the art center.

The reproduction of 500 sets of The New Lottery (This includes 5 tables to play, the 45 cards and a manual with each illustrated concept)
The work coordination and approach to these spaces; shelters, schools and marginalized communities. A weekly visit in 12 spaces for 3 months.
The work of the documentalist, recording the process of the development, as well as demonstrations and our approaches with these groups.
Post-Production:
The work of the workshop professionals that will lead the games with each community.
Transportation and gasoline to get to these spaces.
Food and drink for the work team.
 What will you receive in return?With your donation we will be to help us out  to produce and reproduce La Nueva Lotería on a large scale, in order to take it to other communities in Baja California and, if possible, to other spaces in the rest of the México. We cross our fingers for having the scope we want with this project, because if so, we can invite other illustrators, psychologists and workshop professionals in the country to join the project and can take sets of La Nueva Lotería to their communities. We have a variety of contributions for your donation, you can be the first to have a set ready to play, a surprise poster of a card, a set of stickers, an original illustration of a card or exclusive access to the videos of the creative process of La Nueva Lotería. You can check the column on your right hand to have more information about this. Other Ways to Support
If you have printing services, it would be very helpful to obtain a sponsorship of these services in order to reproduce the 500 sets of La Nueva Lotería.
If you are a resident of Mexico and do not have a debit or credit card to make a donation, we can share a Saldazo account to make donations through this means.
If you do not have resources or do not want to donate, it would be very helpful if you share our link with your family, friends, colleagues or school in your social networks.

From New Delhi, India. Founder of Genses. It is a tiny startup company registered in the UK, and I am the only person behind it at the moment. To describe the problem that Genses is trying to tackle in one sentence:  There is a gigantic gap between how ordinary people think and how Successful people think.      Ordinary people percieve success and fulfillment as a matter of mere good luck or sometimes as a miracle.  Not to sound cheesy, but I want to break this prejudice by showing that success is no miracle. That it involves a lot of struggle. And how it is still possible for ordinary people despite these struggles, to make their own success and find fulfillment.  Genses will be a platform (Website), where you can learn about the struggle stories of highly successful people in detail, and then ask them a lengthy question regarding their journey or advice regarding your own dire situations.   You will get a guaranteed response from them within a certain time-frame.     Before we get into the pitch, let's take an in-depth look at the problem.    There is a gigantic gap between how ordinary people think and how successful people think.  This is a huge problem with many different dimensions. These are the following 5 dimensions that Genses aims to tackle (and solve):     • You lack enough validation and proof for the fact that you can find success in unconventional and difficult endeavors. • Success is often percieved as a miracle. Successful people in turn are seen as super-human. This breeds anxiety and kills inspiration to even start something. Let alone, keep going when things get tough. • There are a lot more successful people around the world, from different walks of life, than you know and are aware of. They’re just not that famous. But they do have some of the most inspiring stories that are less known or not known at all. • There is no effective way for you to have a hearty interaction with a said successful person, from a different country and/or from a different walk of life. • You are stuck with only the people you know or recommendations in your vicinity to get advice for critical decisions regarding something you may want to pursue.        To make the wisdom of successful people attainable to ordinary people who are struggling in unconventional or difficult endeavors to find success.   How?  By doing two things:  1) De-mystifying success stories and bringing the struggles associated with them into the light through detailed story-telling.2) Enabling long and hearty interactions between the said ordinary people and successful people.  To read about the mission of Genses and it's background in more detail, visit: www.thegenses.com/mission    Adventurers, pioneering entrepreneurs, music composers, film-makers, self-made billionaires, endurance athletes, authors, actors and more from around the world. Is there currently any way for you to discover people like these, their stories of struggle and have hearty interactions with them?   (Image used just for the purpose of an illustrative example*)  At Genses, an Outlier is anyone who has overcome substantial struggles and found success and fulfillment in difficult and/or unconventional endeavors. (*With all due respect to Malcolm Gladwell, this has nothing to do with his philosophies.)  Inspirational people who make life choices that lie outside the ordinary.    Outliers on Genses will be a community of these successful people, who will be sharing their stories of struggle and directly answering questions from you. There are a ton of successful people around the world, who are not very famous, but have  inspiring stories. Genses will attempt to bring them to you.   Take a look at some of the famous ones: www.thegenses.com/outliers*Not currently associated with Genses.     Struggle is relatable. It is not often written about because it is not glamorous, yet it is the only real thing you can use to relate with a successful person.  Learning about successful people's struggles can reveal to us the attitude and philosophy used by those who've managed overcome substantial struggles in order to make their success through turbulence. They chose to think through the difficult situations differently, to make their success.     It's a simple three-step process    1) You learn about the story of struggles of an Outlier crafted by Genses. 2) You ask them a lengthy question. 3) You get an answer.  1) Story of Struggle The Outlier's real life story of struggle will be directly collected from them by the team at Genses. They will be displayed on the platform in two forms. You can either read these stories, or use the interactive story-telling feature (Work In Progress).  These stories will be collected in rich detail and checked for high accuracy from and by the Outliers themselves.    2) Asking a question to the Outlier After you learn about the story of the Outlier, you will have two options to ask a lengthy question to the said Outlier. A) Ask a question related to their journey/struggles.B) Ask a question related to your own dire situations. (*Example) Each question will have a 1500 character limit. Ample space to express yourself.  3) Your Answer After you've crafted your question and made the payment, you will be sent a confirmation regarding whether or not your question needs to be re-framed. If it passes the screening, your question will be sent in to the Outlier.It may take anywhere from 1-2 weeks for your question to get answered. You must understand that these Outliers operate on extremely busy schedules.   To learn about how Genses will work in more detail, please visit: www.thegenses.com/inner-workings   Trust & Inspiration 1) Trust in the Outliers. You want to ask questions and interact with people who don't just claim to be successful. You want to know that their talk has substance to it. Their real-life stories will help you build that trust that they have walked the walk before talking the talk. 2) Inspiration. One of the aims of Genses, is to inspire you to make your own success. Real-life stories of these successful people will be displayed on the platform as proof that it is very much possible. Good story-telling  rouses you to a sense of  higher awareness and hence can be a highly potent source of inspiration.      Why this price?  It is not too cheap,  it is not too expensive. Spending $5 to learn about and interact with someone from a higher ethos is money well-spent. Moreover, it is the cost of the two main services that Genses will be providing to its users: A) Crafting the story of the Outlier in rich detail and high accuracy. B) Being an intermediary by handling the logistics of the Q&A between the users and the Outliers.  Furthermore, I do not wish to rely on advertisements as a source of revenue for Genses.Ads eat into user experience in an extremely unhealthy way. Hence, I prefer to have a direct revenue stream rather than relying on advertisements which can be annoying for both the end user and for a company.(This will later turn into a subscription model once the company hits a decent scale where the cost per question will go down further.)  Visit here to learn more about pricing:  www.thegenses.com/pricing   Genses has a definite priority from day one.  Maintaining a healthy user culture of mutual support and respect.  It always starts from day one. Hence, there are some rules while asking a question on Genses that every user is requested to understand and keep in mind.  To Read about the user culture on Genses, visit: www.thegenses.com/user-culture    As with any startup, The challenges and obstacles are immense and it is impossible to foresee all of those at the outset. But the 2 biggest ones that have presented themselves as of yet, are:  1) Finding Outliers and convincing them.Successful people are hard to come in contact with. The only way that I've used that has proven effective is cold emailing.  I have currently got 9 highly successful people interested in Genses through cold emailing.  2) Getting them to be regular and active on the platform. We all know how busy successful people are. After all, there is a reason they are successful. It will take some effort to get them to actively engage in the platform. It requires us to nourish and create strong relationships with these successful people.     Plan to overcome these obstacles  1) Finding and convincing Outliers. If the campaign goal is met, I plan to use most of the funds to personally travel to each of these Outliers who are interested in Genses, and meet them in person, no matter where they are in the world. Meeting someone in person to convince them is not only 10x more effective, it will really help them to take this seriously.  To quote Airbnb Co-founder Joe Gebbia, ""Do things that don't scale.""  2) Getting them to answer actively and engage regularly on the platform. The key here is to spend most of the time and energy to nourish and create strong relationships with the Outliers who will be the first to try it.  To create an experience for them where they will enjoy participating and feel fulfilled. They have to know that their participation is making a real-time positive difference in other people's lives.    How am I qualified to do this?  I'm crazy enough to go to different countries to meet with them in person when the easy way would be to just talk to them on the phone or video calling them. But the easy way almost always means a highly ineffective way.Meeting them in person would ensure that they take this seriously enough and know we take their participation extremely seriously.    As of now, there are currently  After hundreds of cold-emails, 9 highly successful people have show their interest in participating in Genses. This was done without any outside help, recommendations or connections. This was done just through cold emailing.   I cannot and will not reveal their names before the launch so as to respect their privacy. The fact that they have agreed to share their stories and become part of this is a virtue of their good character. Sharing their names and involvement without their consent before launch would be disrespectful towards them.  I have only had agreements over email. Since these Outliers are spread out in 5 different countries, there is not enough capital available for me to afford travel to all 5 countries.         1) They are almost all over the age of 45 They are at a point in their lives where they are taking it easy in their careers and are not as busy. This leads to a higher chance of them being willing to be part of a cause that is greater than themselves and devoting time to it.  2) They are not very widely known yet they have some huge accomplishments and have encountered some significant struggles to get there They have some of the most inspiring stories you will ever hear of finding success after encountering significant difficulties, yet they are not widely known.   3) Reached the peak of their careers and looking back As mentioned before, they are in a more relaxed mindset at this point in their lives and spend a lot of time reflecting.   4) Desire and enjoy reflecting on their own journey and sharing the wisdom learned from it . Some of them really do love to give back their wisdom and time. Genses aims to give them the platform to do so hoping that in the future, this brings about a cultural revolution among the successful.      Your investment will go into four main areas:  1) Building a new platform/website2) Covering travel expenses (Main expense)3) Buying Equipment4) Miscellaneous and Unexpected Expenses  If the campaign goal is met $15,000   If the campaign exceeds the target.    1) Building the platform/websiteI will be building a new website as the current one is an explanatory one and not very functional. The platform will initially be a website.  Money will go towards, building and buying hosting services, SSL, G-Suite and security and rest of what is required. 2) Covering Travel ExpensesAs mentioned earlier, it is one of my top priorities to meet with Outliers personally  to ensure their concrete interest of participation and ensure that they are actually enthusiastic about it. To make sure that they are enthusiastic and are excited about participation, it is absolutely imperative that they are each met in person and explained the concept of Genses to.   3) Buying equipmentA small part of the money raised will be used to buy a new computer and some other necessary hardware. (I have been using a 10 year old desktop until now.) 4) Miscellaneous and Unexpected ExpensesAs with any startup, there can be a plethora of unexpected expenses. And I am very well aware of how they can accrue. So the remaining money will be used/ kept for that.  And if the campaign exceeds its target...  5) HiringThe excess capital will be used to hire a) A video-game designer to create interactive versions of the stories,b) A web developer to add high functionality to the platform.    September & October The two most important tasks during this period:  1) New Website/Platform A whole new website with professional aesthetics, high functionality and easy payments system will be built.2) Meeting Outliers All the current Outliers will be met in person and their participation will be finalized. Plus 1 More Outlier so the total number of Outliers on Launch day is 10.      The planned launch of Genses is subject to when it has 10 or more Outliers who are on board with participating in this. If the campaign goal is met, I plan to reach the aforementioned target of 10 Outliers, build the platform and launch in  Late November 2018 This is still a tentative date as the launch is subject a multitude of potential obstacles. However, the priority will be to launch as early as November 2018 and no later than December 2018.   Perks for the Backers of this campaign Include QUESTIONS  Get your first 5 questions for $2 Number Available: 30    Get your First 10 Questions for $10 Number Available: 25   HISTORY OF GENSES  The Super Believers: $500              Quantity: 10      10 Backers, who believe in Genses more than everyone else, will have their Name, a picture of them, and the opportunity to pen a self-written note on why they believed in Genses, published on the history page of the platform.www.thegenses.com/historyNote: It is recommended that you claim this perk ONLY if you believe in Genses that much.   The Believers: $2                   Quantity: Unlimited   Each and every backer, who wants to have their name down in the history of Genses, will have their Name and where they're from, published on the history page of the platform.www.thegenses.com/history   Targets for year one: Spend time building and nourishing the community of Outliers. Target number of Active Outliers by the end of year 1 (i.e. November 2019): 50  Long term goals include (Within the next 5 years) Have successful people from all walks of life on the platform; Have Outliers from as many countries as possible; Bringing out the untold stories of successes after struggles; Creating a culture of giving back wisdom and time among Outliers (Successful people).    I incorporated Genses as a limited company on 23rd April, 2018, in the United Kingdom. Genses Ltd. is a private limited company, registered in England and Wales.Company registration number: 11322869.Registered Office: Building/Unit 16238, West Central, London, W1A 6US. PO Box: 6945  SUPPORT & INQUIRIES For all questions regarding Genses, please reach out to me directly at:  strider.genses@gmail.com NOTE: I am the only person behind this project at the moment. So I would like to request due patience on your part. I will try my best to answer as many individual queries as possible.  Thank you.    I am Arjun Menon. I'm currently working alone on this project. However, I do plan to put together a talented team in the near future. (Depending how the campaign goes.) I have a passion for good story-telling and it's potential as a source of inspiration through difficult times, and I have an equal excitement for what the world would look like if ordinary people like me and you could have hearty and meaningful interactions with highly successful people, whom you have no chance of interacting with otherwise.  Genses is, at its core, an attempt at the amalgamation of these two things.  I hope to launch Genses simply to express the idea that success is no miracle, and really it is always possible for ordinary people. That really is my WHY and reason for getting up in the morning.    I have dropped out of College and have been working full time on this. I've faced a ton of rejections from professional investors who've said that this could never commercially viable. I obviously do not believe them, and hence, here is the campaign.  If the campaign goal is met, I promise to give everything I have within me to build Genses into a great product and service and in turn build a great company that supremely solves this problem.     Thank you for your time if you got this far. I am extremely grateful if you have decided to fund this.

<h2>Lit. Schools: Bring Diversity To The Bookshelf</h2>
<p>Help close the literacy gap by bringing minority authors and characters to elementary classrooms and curriculums across the country. </p>
<p><strong>Books have the power to change cultures, shape perspectives, and boost literacy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And it all starts in the classroom.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
<p>A 2018 study by CCBC found that <strong>just 23% of children/young adult books</strong> received depicted <strong>characters from diverse backgrounds</strong>: 10% African American, 7% Asian Pacific Islander/ Asian Pacific American, 5% Latinx, and 1% American Indians/First Nations.¹</p>
<p>Compared to 46% of white students, <strong>only 17% of Black students</strong> in eighth grade had reading percentages at or above the proficient level². The apparent <strong>lack of culturally relevant (CR) literature</strong> in elementary education is partially to blame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606245776/ysoejoaurx0hjrlfn4q3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since 1990, Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings has analyzed the effect of CR material on reading achievement. She and other authorities agree that by using “<strong>culturally relevant reading materials in their literacy lessons</strong>, [educators] can engage the learner in the concepts being taught on a <strong>more meaningful and personal level.</strong>”²</p>
<p>Since 2014, <strong>minority students have made up the majority</strong> of public school enrollment, projected to <strong>reach 54.7% by 2022</strong>.³</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606245853/glgz8oyq8rnw2h5pwnsr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Shouldn’t it follow that these students are <strong>represented by the books</strong> in their classrooms?</p>
<p><strong>We think so. </strong></p>
<p>And with your help,  we can <strong>do something</strong> about it.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
<p><strong>Lit. Schools</strong> is a nonprofit committed to connecting elementary educators with <strong>culturally relevant material </strong>for their classrooms, <strong>boosting literacy rates</strong> of at-risk readers, and <strong>increasing awareness</strong> of minority authors and their work.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>With your donations teachers, librarians, and school leaders will have the opportunity to apply to receive a <strong>curated set of books free of charge</strong>, plus access to classroom resources and materials to provide culturally relevant instruction. </p>
<p>Together, we can <strong>increase the literacy and success </strong>of all students, especially minorities.</p>

<p><strong>$5,000</strong>: Create and build Lit. Books online presence</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Lit. Schools: Bring Diversity To The Bookshelf
Help close the literacy gap by bringing minority authors and characters to elementary classrooms and curriculums across the country. 
Books have the power to change cultures, shape perspectives, and boost literacy.
And it all starts in the classroom.
 
 
THE PROBLEM
A 2018 study by CCBC found that just 23% of children/young adult books received depicted characters from diverse backgrounds: 10% African American, 7% Asian Pacific Islander/ Asian Pacific American, 5% Latinx, and 1% American Indians/First Nations.¹
Compared to 46% of white students, only 17% of Black students in eighth grade had reading percentages at or above the proficient level². The apparent lack of culturally relevant (CR) literature in elementary education is partially to blame.
 

 
Since 1990, Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings has analyzed the effect of CR material on reading achievement. She and other authorities agree that by using “culturally relevant reading materials in their literacy lessons, [educators] can engage the learner in the concepts being taught on a more meaningful and personal level.”²
Since 2014, minority students have made up the majority of public school enrollment, projected to reach 54.7% by 2022.³
 

 
Shouldn’t it follow that these students are represented by the books in their classrooms?
We think so. 
And with your help,  we can do something about it.  
 
 
THE SOLUTION
Lit. Schools is a nonprofit committed to connecting elementary educators with culturally relevant material for their classrooms, boosting literacy rates of at-risk readers, and increasing awareness of minority authors and their work.
 

 
With your donations teachers, librarians, and school leaders will have the opportunity to apply to receive a curated set of books free of charge, plus access to classroom resources and materials to provide culturally relevant instruction. 
Together, we can increase the literacy and success of all students, especially minorities.
 
 
THE NEED
Our initial goal of $10,000 will fund the establishment and maintenance of Lit. Schools and our online bookstore, Lit. Books. 
$700: Register Lit. Schools as a nonprofit, 501(c)3
$5,000: Create and build Lit. Books online presence
$4,300+: Initial donation to fund classroom libraries in underserved communities
If we do not reach our goal, all funds collected will go towards registering Lit. Schools as nonprofit 501(c)3 and Initial donation to fund classroom libraries.
If you are unable to donate, you can help us out by sharing this campaign on social media or with friends and family. Once Lit. Books is operational, you can help by purchasing titles from our curated inventory.
 
 
THE PERKS*
$1 - $500 donation: Personalized thank you note and your name on the donor page.
$501 - $1000 donation: Personalized thank you note and your name on the donor page AND Curated set of books for a school/teacher of your choice. 
$1000+ donation: Personalized thank you note and your name on the donor page AND Curated set of books for a school/teacher of your choice AND official sponsor listed on all marketing materials for one year. 
 
 
THE ORGANIZER
I’m Shante Williams, a BIPOC 5th and 6th-grade teacher with a Master’s degree in Teaching and Early Childhood Education. For three years, I’ve worked for charter schools in underserved, predominantly minority communities in Houston, TX. 
 

 
Appalled by the lack of diversity in my own classroom bookshelf, I used my own money to purchase culturally relevant books to use in my curriculum. 
And I’m not alone. 94 percent of U.S. teachers spend their own money on school supplies, including books.⁴
 

 
I believe access to CR literature shouldn’t be the financial responsibility of teachers like me. So I started Lit. Schools.
Your donation would mean the world to me, the students I teach every day, and classrooms like mine across the country. 
Sincerely,
