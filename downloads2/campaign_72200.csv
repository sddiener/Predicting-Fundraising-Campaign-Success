<h3>The Visions that Changed Everything<br/>
</h3> 

Have you ever heard that what you loved as a child, is where your bliss can be found?<br/><br/>
<p>As you can see, I have a thing for Lions. For as long 
as I can remember, the big cats have always captivated me. <br/><br/><b><b>I thought it was just an innocent adoration of big cats  . . . until April 2013.</b></b><br/><br/>While on vacation in Maui, I had a vision. <br/><br/>I was in the middle of a huge life transition and I didn't want to leave Maui just yet, so I changed my ticket to stay one extra night and attend a special yoga class with the women I traveled with. <br/><br/>And so 2 hours before I was to jump on the plane back home, I landed on my yoga mat soaking up every last moments of Maui and this amazing teacher. <br/><br/>I was facing a white stucco wall when I saw The Face emerge. It was a man, perhaps African, Polynesian, Maori . . .I couldn't tel for sure. His energy was that of a shaman, a leader in his community. I watched him as he surveyed over the land, with a staff in his hand. Then I saw the perimeter of his face transform into rays of sunlight and then into a lions mane.<br/></p>
<p><b>I asked: ""who are you?""<br/><br/>He said; ""Lion King. Sun King.""<br/><br/>And that was it! <br/><br/>I learned nothing more of this Sun King/Lion King until August 2014 when I had another vision while in deep meditation. <br/><br/>This time a black panther came to me.<br/></b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>After receiving some guidance from the panther, I asked; <br/><br/>""How shall I know you?"" <br/></b></p>
<p><b>The panther replied, ""Mika""</b><br/><br/> It wasn't until January 2015 that the pieces began to come together in over 10 months of undeniable downloads &amp; synchronicity. <br/><br/>The journey has taken me to the wisdom of Egypt and the pyramids, South American and African Shamanism, to the White Lions of Timbavati and <b>INTO the </b><i><b>heart of what truly lives within each of us. </b></i><br/><br/><b><b>I have always believed Peace is Possible and w</b></b><b>hen Lionhearted people unite, Peace is Possible in OUR lifetime. </b><br/></p>

<b><h3><b><h3>Introducing MiKA:<br/>The Malas with a LionHearted Mission</h3></b></h3></b>MiKA Malas is THE creative engine that will help me share the message of Lionheartedness.<br/><br/>When I created the malas and began to share them, I found they resonate with 
people of all different beliefs because the geometries are sacred 
symbols of UNITY. The symbols are not outside of ourselves. They ARE us. <b><br/><br/>The malas represent UNITY, Balance, Christ Consciousness, Creativity, Mastery, Magic, Peace, Infinite possibility . . .</b> and more . . .and most of all, they represent the truth of who YOU are - the legacy of your Divinity. <br/><br/>I created these talismans to remind you and support you <b>in your journey of remembering and embodiment.<br/></b><br/><b><h3>

<ul> </ul> </div> </div>","Who Am I and Why Am I Asking For Your Support
 Hi, I'm Monica. I am a mother, writer, visionary, community builder, moon gazer, sun goddess and earth wisdom keeper. What if making a difference was more simple that we realize?This modern era causes us to ceaselessly hustle for the very things that take us away from what we most desire; inner peace and human connection. 
My vision is simple.  By having the courage to honor the deepest desires of our Heart, we step onto our highest creative path. Creativity and Leadership have the power to transform the world.  I believe the Peace, Harmony, Balance and Connection we desire in our own lives and the world requires us to become Lionhearted so that we can face the challenges of our world and turn them into transformations that serve our deepest needs as humanity.
We are now ready for new inspired models of collaboration and I believe that a united tribe of lionhearted creatives and leaders is needed to bring great change to a world in need.



A Lionhearted Person is cultivating these qualities: 

Committed to Truth. You value Truth as a powerful catalyst for change and growth. You know that speaking your truth with love, sets you free. You stand up for truth, even if you need to roar. You are mastering saying NO so that you can say YES to your deeper truth.
Walk the Heart PathYou are stepping boldly into actualizing the dreams in your heart. You refuse to close your heart, even in the face of hurt because you know have chosen a path of love. You see vulnerability as a strength.Cultivate Self LoveYou know that Love for Self is your highest path. You are committed to giving yourself what you seek from others. You water your heart with compassion, forgiveness and acceptance. You know that loving yourself is the most powerful way to spread love and peace on the planet.
Follow the SignsThe mystery of life is revealing itself to you and you trust your intuition. You receive signs on your path as confirmation and synchronicity is occurring more and more. In FlowYou are tuning into Earth energies and receiving guidance from Source, and your Higher Self. This connection is where you find your fuel, vision and creative inspirations.  Committed to Self MasteryYou go deep within yourself, layer by layer learning how to shift pain into power. You take responsibility for your life and choose to be all that you are. You know the answers are within and shifting to an inner directed life. Are CourageousYou know change is necessary to be true to your heart. You are boldly making changes in your life to reflect your authentic truth. You are releasing your desire for approval from others as you become stronger in your truth. 
Reclaiming PowerYou desire to be self actualized, autonomous and radiant, from the inside out. You are shifting away from victim mindset to one of power by seeing the gifts in your journey. You are tapping into the energies of the inner shaman. You are becoming more gentle, yet you feel your inner power growing. Walking the Path of BeautyYou are more and more humbled by life and see Grace unfolding around you. You are seeing with new eyes and deeply moved by the simple everyday moments of beauty. 
Desire to Serve and Express Your Inner GiftsYou are stepping onto the path of Spirit and feel moved to make a difference in your own unique way. You are beginning to seek out collaboration and community. You desire to share your inner gifts and talents for the betterment of humanity. Embracing the Compassionate AND Fierce VOICE.You are waking up to injustices of the world and feeling the inner lion rising to add your voice. You are fierce about protecting values that honor the basic rights of humanity. If you are a parent, you do not follow the mainstream, you understand LEGACY, you know the power of light, you choose peace through NO violence yet you are not afraid to step forward and say NO More. Finding your Tribe You no longer desire to ""do it alone"" and seek out community, collaboration, support and opportunities that benefit ALL. You are releasing relationships with love that no longer serve and finding that your soul tribe is showing up in magical ways!
It is time to awaken the Lionheart within. It is time for lionhearted people to unite and boldly step into co-creating a world in Harmony,
 Balance and Peace. There is NO other time. The time is NOW.We are the change and Peace begins with US.This campaign and vision has been created to share this message across the globe. I invite you to join me!



The Visions that Changed Everything
 

Have you ever heard that what you loved as a child, is where your bliss can be found?
As you can see, I have a thing for Lions. For as long 
as I can remember, the big cats have always captivated me. I thought it was just an innocent adoration of big cats  . . . until April 2013.While on vacation in Maui, I had a vision. I was in the middle of a huge life transition and I didn't want to leave Maui just yet, so I changed my ticket to stay one extra night and attend a special yoga class with the women I traveled with. And so 2 hours before I was to jump on the plane back home, I landed on my yoga mat soaking up every last moments of Maui and this amazing teacher. I was facing a white stucco wall when I saw The Face emerge. It was a man, perhaps African, Polynesian, Maori . . .I couldn't tel for sure. His energy was that of a shaman, a leader in his community. I watched him as he surveyed over the land, with a staff in his hand. Then I saw the perimeter of his face transform into rays of sunlight and then into a lions mane.
I asked: ""who are you?""He said; ""Lion King. Sun King.""And that was it! I learned nothing more of this Sun King/Lion King until August 2014 when I had another vision while in deep meditation. This time a black panther came to me.

After receiving some guidance from the panther, I asked; ""How shall I know you?"" 
The panther replied, ""Mika"" It wasn't until January 2015 that the pieces began to come together in over 10 months of undeniable downloads & synchronicity. The journey has taken me to the wisdom of Egypt and the pyramids, South American and African Shamanism, to the White Lions of Timbavati and INTO the heart of what truly lives within each of us. I have always believed Peace is Possible and when Lionhearted people unite, Peace is Possible in OUR lifetime. 


Introducing MiKA:The Malas with a LionHearted MissionMiKA Malas is THE creative engine that will help me share the message of Lionheartedness.When I created the malas and began to share them, I found they resonate with 
people of all different beliefs because the geometries are sacred 
symbols of UNITY. The symbols are not outside of ourselves. They ARE us. The malas represent UNITY, Balance, Christ Consciousness, Creativity, Mastery, Magic, Peace, Infinite possibility . . . and more . . .and most of all, they represent the truth of who YOU are - the legacy of your Divinity. I created these talismans to remind you and support you in your journey of remembering and embodiment.
Here are the first MiKA Mala designs








The Malas: Three sacred symbols come together on one pendant. The seed of life or solar mandala, the anahata or star of david and the royal lion. Every mala is created using 108 semi precious stones and wood beads. The MiKA Mission: To create a global humanitarian community of highly creative, visionary Lionhearted People. We ARE powerful agents of positive change when we come together as #lionheartsinaction.  By collaborating with creative change agents, new feminine & masculine leaders, grass root and larger humanitarian organizations, we can bring fulfill our collective dream of World Peace.  The Message: When Lionhearted People Unite - Peace is Possible.Making a Difference: Every $77 MiKA Mala Perk will come in a reclaimed silk sari pouch! MiKA is collaborating with ""Made with a Purpose"" and the pouches are made by 6 women in India that in turn, supports the women and children in their community with education and economic sustainability. Global Campaigns #lionheartsinaction: In early spring,  MiKA Malas will launch the first campaign with a fresh creative & lionhearted focus on cultivating inner peace. The campaign will specifically focus on bringing awareness to our global epidemic around mental illness.

Through MiKA Malas, I Envision:


passionately sharing the message of Lionheartedness & Peace.

building a global humanitarian community of #lionheartsinaction

</div></div>","Hello, My name is Tammy Dennis

Me and my family have had this idea for the past 5 years and never had the funds to follow through. We have been working on this idea for a long time and I have the know how, but could never take it to the next level. I never knew that there were websites like this that help make dreams come true. 
We want to open ColdStreets.Com to help the so many homeless people out in the streets by selling our shirts and other apparel worldwide. We will give a percentage of every sale to homeless shelters and soup kitchens to help feed people in need. We believe that no one should be cold and hungry and if we could make someones day just a little brighter that is something I want to be a part of. So we need your help to make this happen :) 
We need just about everything to get this started.  I have the website and the knowledge,  but the stuff needed is pricey to start.  I know once we get all set up there will be no stopping us from achieving our goals of continuously helping the needy. All of the people we would be able to help because of your generosity. I want to Thank You now from the bottom of my heart. For any help! even if it is just a simple share :) Tammy D.

</p><p>I'm Kela Hunte a 34 year old Fort Myers native single, mother
of 4. I started an Event planning &amp; decorating service 7 seven months ago
and became a licensed Insurance agent 1 month ago. And I’m currently in a financial
crisis so I’m “Designing for Dollars”. My specialty is custom &amp; unique events
like parties, showers &amp; custom decorations. And life &amp; auto insurance,
debt reduction and retirement planning. However, I will make a custom
arrangement for you with a contribution of at least $30.</p>
<p>I have a professional experience
spanning over 10 years in customer service &amp; insurance. But April 2012 my
oldest son which was 14 at the time got injured after losing control of his
dirt bike and hitting the side of our neighbor’s house. And at the time of my
son’s accident I was a Service Manager for a local branch of Cintas; where I
had managed to get my family off welfare, out of an abusive relationship, into
a gated community and payoff a car. But when Shad got hurt he was in the
hospital for several months with me 24/7 at his bed side. Cintas let me go
because I had missed 3 months of work and had no idea when I was going to be
able to return to work. During that time Shad had been on Life support, life
flight to Miami and later Gainesville because he suffered several complications
including basically him ripping his brain in half, causing a close skull brain
injury resulting in him having amnesia, abnormal brain activity because of the
traumatic brain injury. He also crushed his femur in about 13 pieces and road
rash to about 45% of his body, which later required plastic surgery. Ultimately,
I didn’t work for over a year caring for him alone. Later, I managed to get a
job working for a temp agency and later a local physician group in the
insurance department. However, I was fired in March of 2015. After missing too
much time from work, after my son had a black out and fell down stairs at
school, re-breaking his leg requiring him to have his 3<sup>rd</sup> surgery in
3 years. To provide for my children I chose to use my hobby and passion as a source
of income because that was my 2<sup>nd</sup> job I’ve lost since his accident. And Shad will like require a further surgery
in the future and he still has 2 years of school left.</p>
<p>I'm currently working out of my garage trying to get started.
Over the past 7 months I've done several events for mostly for my family and
friends; but with what little money I had saved and the money I made I’ve bought
tools, supplies to work with but it hasn’t netted me enough income to stay
current on my bills. The electric is getting shut off every other month, I’ve
been paying my rent and car payment in pieces and food stamps only buy uncooked
food. I have 3 other children in school and have various school start and
dismissals. My younger kids don’t meet the criteria for a bus and I can’t
afford an after school program so I have to pick them up and drop daily. Shad has
daily rehab in which I transport him to and from and gas alone is killing me.
He can’t drive or work yet. But we’re gaining constantly so I have Hope he will
one day. But between the 2 businesses I hardly ever sleep or eat much anymore.
I’m not dating anyone so I don’t have the benefit of a spouse. However, now
that they’re back in school I’m looking for a night job too. </p>
<p>Because I am a Christian and truly believe in God. My faith
won’t allow me deceive anyone or do something wrong for money. And I didn’t
panic because I’m believing God for a miracle in all this. But several people
suggested me telling my story and creating a campaign to see if I could get
some help. </p>
<p>I'm talented and I Love being able to be apart my clients
special events. Event planning and decorating is truly my passion! And I’d
rather earn my income than beg for it. But I’m stuck between this, winning the lottery
or accept being homeless and take my kids to a shelter. Keeping me going allows
me the opportunity to create my own success and be the Caregiver my family
needs me to be. Because of my situation I want to help get families covered
with the best insurance they can afford and celebrate as much as possible. Because
if I had been properly protected my son’s accident though life changing and
tragic my coverage would have protected me from financial ruin and devastation.
</p>
<p>I'm currently in need of money to my past due rent of $1235,
plus Oct rent. I need $900 to get my car out of repossession, $90 for me &amp;
Shad’s cell phone, $217 for the past due electric and household essentials. I
share an office space with 2 photographer’s that are trying to help me get on
my feet. But the office is in Cape Coral and I can’t afford the gas and tolls
getting to from their office. They asked me to pay $75 a week for rent. But I can’t
even do it. I was recently on TV being interviewed about my business and it got
me a few calls but nothing in concrete yet. </p>
<p>My goal is to eventually, get current on my bills, invest in
some marketing and launch a website and open a Store front location to use as an
event venue and a place to mentor kids. Since I’m a single parent and have my
kids all the time, I figure I can help other parents keep their jobs by helping
them with their kids while they work. I believe with my Unquenchable thirst for
success and relentless drive for Customer Satisfaction I can offer my community
a one of a kind experiences and a business that will pay it forward and give
back. If you can please share my story and help us it would be a blessing.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Carina. I'm a 25-year-old baker who just happens to be blind. Growing up in Connecticut, I learned great values from my parents and grandparents who left Sweden and Ireland to start new lives in New England. They turned uncertainty into productivity as they fought for their new homeland and started new businesses that became lasting legacies and enabled them to pass down treasured skills, talents, and recipes. We thrive on hospitality, a drive to push forward, and a love of food. I loved to be hands on and hands in everything edible, hiding away in the kitchen to make a new recipe to serve warm out of the oven at the end of a long day. As a teenager, I gained friends and supporters as I cranked out cookies and coffee cakes and sold them on my tricycle to prepare for my big dream of bakery ownership. My long-awaited entrance into pastry school, however, showed me the challenge of competing with my peers in an industry of speed, visual appeal, and conformity.

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Carina. I'm a 25-year-old baker who just happens to be blind. Growing up in Connecticut, I learned great values from my parents and grandparents who left Sweden and Ireland to start new lives in New England. They turned uncertainty into productivity as they fought for their new homeland and started new businesses that became lasting legacies and enabled them to pass down treasured skills, talents, and recipes. We thrive on hospitality, a drive to push forward, and a love of food. I loved to be hands on and hands in everything edible, hiding away in the kitchen to make a new recipe to serve warm out of the oven at the end of a long day. As a teenager, I gained friends and supporters as I cranked out cookies and coffee cakes and sold them on my tricycle to prepare for my big dream of bakery ownership. My long-awaited entrance into pastry school, however, showed me the challenge of competing with my peers in an industry of speed, visual appeal, and conformity. Since then, I’ve been on a mission to share my passion while putting the ABILITY back in disability.
Now, with an MBA and a move to the land of creative thinkers in Portland, Oregon behind me, I am out to pursue my love of the artistic science of baking while building on the drive and pioneering spirit of my ancestors into a movement of change that even Portland needs. Nearly 1 in 5 people have some sort of challenge that we classify as a disability. They may live life with one leg missing, or might not be able to walk at all.

<b><u>Short Summary</u></b>
<p>In the East African region, Uganda is ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> to
Tanzania in the production of common beans but only exports 20% as most smallholder
farmers can’t access lucrative international markets due to low quality yields.
Rural farmers lack both reliable and
cost efficient inputs such as fertilizers, seeds and guaranteed profitable
markets for their output. In many countries, such farmers could become more
marginalized as larger firms become increasingly necessary for a profitable
operation.</p>

<p><b><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The
risk is failing to raise <b>$70,000 </b>to purchase the Farmers Agriculture Kit and
produce 1,300 MTs in the 1<sup>st</sup> year. If the funds we receive don’t reach
the entire goal of 1,400 farmers, we shall keep looking for support funds to
inject in our $70,000 farmers agriculture kit revolving fund.<span>  But it won’t stop us from beginning, if we
have raised kits of over 500 farmers, we will still start and progress slowly
to show the Buyer that we are ready and committed to perform.</span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>In-case
of over production, we plan to sell the extra tons of beans to the local
markets. Jay Fortune realizes that if farmers can sell their surplus
production, this will as well improve incomes and food security.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Another
risk is side selling by farmers to local traders.<span>  We will minimize this risk by ensuring that
each farmer commits himself through contract signing and follows the rules and
regulations that will be embedded in the contract.  Also, we plan involve village leaders who
will be part of our field extension networking. 
Constant monitoring of farmers and gardens will also lessen this risk.</span></p>

3rd year, farmers will triple to 4,200.  The 1400 farmers
who received kits in the 2nd year will donate to another 1400
farmers in the 3rd year. Production
in the 3rd year will increase to 3,900 metric tones which is our targeted annual volume
supply for the Turkish processor.
· 
170 containers will
be shipped in the 3rd year (3900 tons / 23 tons)
Long-term impact: 4200
farmer’s incomes will be increased to $690/year.  If the same farmers produce the white beans
for a period of 5 years (per
renewable contract), it means a farmer will receive $3,450 in the next 5 years with an increase in foreign
currency of $2,898,000.  This change
will be brought about by you if you can support a farmer with $50 seed capital
to purchase the agriculture kit that will enable them produce a good quality
export white bean crop.  The kit is a
revolving fund kit which makes this whole project sustainable and out rightly minimizes
on donor dependency. HELP US RAISE
$70,000 TO KICK-START AND GO ALL THE WAY TO IMPROVE NOT ONLY A LIFE, BUT AN
ENTIRE FARMERS FAMILY.
Budget:  Other project cost activities
i.e. farmers selection, training workshops on crop management, postharvest
handling, surveys, capacity building, monitoring etc will be met by Jay
Fortune.  

Risks & Challenges
· 
The
risk is failing to raise $70,000 to purchase the Farmers Agriculture Kit and
produce 1,300 MTs in the 1st year. If the funds we receive don’t reach
the entire goal of 1,400 farmers, we shall keep looking for support funds to
inject in our $70,000 farmers agriculture kit revolving fund.  But it won’t stop us from beginning, if we
have raised kits of over 500 farmers, we will still start and progress slowly
to show the Buyer that we are ready and committed to perform.
· 
In-case
of over production, we plan to sell the extra tons of beans to the local
markets. Jay Fortune realizes that if farmers can sell their surplus
production, this will as well improve incomes and food security.
· 
Another
risk is side selling by farmers to local traders.  We will minimize this risk by ensuring that
each farmer commits himself through contract signing and follows the rules and
regulations that will be embedded in the contract.  Also, we plan involve village leaders who
will be part of our field extension networking. 
Constant monitoring of farmers and gardens will also lessen this risk.

Personas con ahorros que invierten en personas con ideas

Inversionate es una FinTech (empresa Financiero Tecnológica) que implementa el modelo de préstamos entre personas (Peer to Peer Lending) para facilitar el encuentro entre quienes acuden al mercado financiero solicitando financiación con quienes se encuentran en la búsqueda de rentabilizar sus ahorros.

Inversionate conecta ambas partes, brindando toda la información necesaria para que inversores y prestatarios tomen las decisiones pertinentes y facilitando todos los mecanismos para que el proceso de inversión y financiación sea sencillo y transparente.



¿Cómo funciona?

Invertir es muy fácil...


Solicitar un préstamo también es sencillo...



La plataforma tecnológica

Estamos trabajando fuerte para completar la plataforma y necesitamos tu ayuda para hacerlo rápido!



El futuro es ahora, el futuro es colaborativo


Nuestra meta como empresa es lograr generar impacto social sostenido. Queremos ayudar a las personas a cumplir sus sueños y alcanzar sus objetivos.
Para ello, nos hemos planteado como objetivos a corto plazo, mejorar la inclusión financiera en la región mediante la democratización en el acceso al financiamiento e inversiones, y ayudar en la educación financiera permitiéndole a cualquier persona invertir de forma segura aunque no cuente con conocimientos previos.
Lograr estos objetivos a corto plazo será la base para alcanzar nuestros objetivos a largo plazo de convertirnos en la empresa líder en Latinoamárica que define el Estado del Arte del P2P Lending y ser la plataforma más grande del rubro en la región, ayudando a su vez a los gobiernos a definir políticas para generar confianza en el modelo.


Con tu Ayuda

El dinero recaudado será destinado a:

Completar el Desarrollo de la primer versión operativa de la plataforma tecnológica
Generar la documentación legal necesaria para comenzar a operar
Capital operativo hasta alcanzar nuestro punto de equilibrio

Hemos elegido el tipo de recaudación flexible, ya que el proyecto se llevará a cabo, incluso si no juntamos el total del dinero mediante esta campaña en Indiegogo, con dinero que obtendremos de otras fuentes de financiación. Es por esto que te puedes quedar tranquilo que si colaboras, recibirás tu recompensa.

Prince Maxwell is a start-up based out of Charleston, West Virginia, created by Bianca Prince and Candice Maxwell. (That's how we got our name!)
Our company mission for the future is to work with small businesses, organizations and creative individuals that will help support and grow our local community, as well as the state of West Virginia. 
The easiest label to give Prince Maxwell would be that we are a public relations, consulting and solutions firm. However, we believe in thinking outside of the box, which often leads us to unique opportunities and diverse experiences. 

What We Need and Why...
Launching a new business is a challenge, but the future of growth in West Virginia is dependent on entrepreneurs to create new jobs.
To get our business off of the ground, we need to purchase our own domain name, pay back the money lent to us for our business license and establish our credibility in the community... Just for starters.  There are many hurdles on the way to becoming a successful business, especially in West Virginia, which take time and money. 


How We Will Use Your Donations...
Along with the larger items, like purchasing a domain name, there are many costs involved with starting and successfully running a small, local business. Some of the things we plan to use your gracious donations include: 
- Business License - Web Hosting- Domain Name- Business Cards- Office Essentials- Travel Expenses- Business apps, like email, etc.
As you can imagine, these and other miscellaneous costs can add up quickly. These donations also go towards our dream of one day acquiring an office space, 
Giving Back!

10% of the funds raised will be donated to Charleston's Heart and Hand, a non-profit mission project. Our money will help them get much-needed doors for their new building!
Heart and Hand is a wonderful non-profit that has programs assisting with food, home repair, construction, utilities, rent, clothing and more.



What Your Donation Means To Us...
Prince Maxwell is not just a public relations firm. We believe in supporting local companies and individuals whose mission benefits our community. By supporting our dream of a firm you are supporting other awesome businesses and organizations in West Virginia, creating more jobs and general ""good-doer-y.""  
We are so grateful for your support in this endeavor. 



Can't Donate? You Can Still Help!
Even if you cannot donate to our campaign, you can still give us a super helpful hand by word of mouth, sharing us on social media and general good vibes. If the community believes in us, that is just as good as money. 

    Being a start-up means that any amount of donations will further our progress. However, with any new business there will be challenges. The biggest risk is the question of sustainability. However, we are committed to making this business a success and excited to take this risk with you.

<p>In 2007, I shifted from teaching middle school language arts and social studies to high school ESL.  Over the next seven years, I worked closely with <strong>Julie Kasper</strong> in creating a department that was responsive to the changes in the Arizona State Legislature and our local school district and to the changing demographics in our student population.  Although our career paths have currently diverged a bit, our collaboration and innovation continue.  Here is her story and the story of <strong>CENTER</strong>:</p><p>Having
taught ESL and ELD in our public schools for over 13 years, I realized that a
shift was necessary - both for myself, for our educational system, and most
importantly for all those it serves.  As School Coordinator for Refugee
Resettlement in Tucson, I've had the unique opportunity to dialog and work with
people from many different walks of life - all of whom contribute
significantly to the educational experiences of refugee and immigrant youth
from birth to young adulthood.  In response to the varied and pressing needs
that have been shared with me and in celebration of the knowledge, skills, and
beautiful dreams that fill our city, CENTER: A Finding Voice Space is being
launched.  It builds on some of the Finding Voice Project work that took
place at Catalina Magnet High School between 2006-2014, but rather than being
housed at one school and serving only one student population, the idea is to
build and develop something sustainable in collaboration with the larger Tucson
community for all who wish to engage and all who can benefit from our work to
transform the educational landscape for linguistically and culturally diverse
learners.  This is an entirely new world for me - and an exciting journey
to be on with you.  Imagine all refugee, immigrant, and globally-minded
education stakeholders in Tucson connecting in one powerful, dynamic, and
creative network.  That is who we will be and what CENTER will
become.  Contribute today to this collective and collaborative adventure! <span>  Thank you!!</span></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>As a
start-up we are in need of just about everything, but because we are lean and
flexible, we will make this happen on whatever scale is possible during our
initial launch.<span>  The more you give, the
more we can develop and offer – but have no fear because this is happening and
it’s going to be amazing thanks to people like you!</span></p>

we’d love to also recognize you (or a loved one you name) in our annual report

invite you to a Founding Members’ special event and tour of CENTER, as well as
provide all the perks already listed.</span></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will mean that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students new to our country,
     many of whom are learning English and trying to adjust to a very different
     and often challenging environment, will have a safe haven – a place they
     can relax, be themselves, nurture their talents and interests, and find
     support to help them thrive personally and academically.</li>
<li>Parents and family members
     of refugee and immigrant pK-12 students will have a place to go to learn
     more about the U.S. (and AZ) schooling system, to ask questions about the
     many school documents they receive, to learn about early childhood
     literacy and numeracy practices, to discover ways they can support their
     child to complete schoolwork, and to build connections with teachers and
     school staff in ways that are comfortable, positive, and enduring.</li>
<li>Teachers, administrators,
     and school staff will have a space for collaborative planning, to learn
     more about refugee resettlement and global realities, to hone their skills
     through professional development offerings to work more effectively with
     culturally and linguistically diverse learners, and to find the support,
     recognition, leadership opportunities, and community they need to do their
     best work in their schools and classrooms.</li>
<li>Refugee resettlement case
     managers and other agency staff will be able to provide newly arriving
     families with a calendar of educational events and supports that they can
     immediately take part in, as well as help their clients understand how and
     where to find help related to educational concerns.</li>
<li>Community partners will be
     able to connect with the wonderfully diverse residents of Tucson and
     develop new and exciting projects to enliven our city, help us all grow
     personally and professionally, and build a stronger foundation for our collective
     development and the future of our region.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We are a small team, but mighty!  We
have been working in the education and refugee resettlement fields for many
years, and we have a lively, intelligent, and committed board to help us
understand and overcome obstacles that arise. 
This is a project we are building with the idea of systems change and sustainability
in mind.  We are using a collective
impact – or collaborative development – model. 
All of these aspects of our organization and our work make us
responsive, flexible, strong, and able to weather storms that may arise.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Sometimes funds are tight on the home-front. 
We get that!  But don’t fret.  Because you have read this far, we know you
want to help get this project off the ground. 
Here are some other ways to help: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Get the word out and make some noise about this
campaign and CENTER.  Use the Indiegogo
share tools or whatever social media (and traditional media) tools you love.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Host a dinner party and tell your friends/family
about this project – encourage them to give if they are able.</li>
<li>Contact us for volunteer opportunities or to make
     donations of useful items for CENTER and for our community of learners.

In 2007, I shifted from teaching middle school language arts and social studies to high school ESL.  Over the next seven years, I worked closely with Julie Kasper in creating a department that was responsive to the changes in the Arizona State Legislature and our local school district and to the changing demographics in our student population.  Although our career paths have currently diverged a bit, our collaboration and innovation continue.  Here is her story and the story of CENTER:Having
taught ESL and ELD in our public schools for over 13 years, I realized that a
shift was necessary - both for myself, for our educational system, and most
importantly for all those it serves.  As School Coordinator for Refugee
Resettlement in Tucson, I've had the unique opportunity to dialog and work with
people from many different walks of life - all of whom contribute
significantly to the educational experiences of refugee and immigrant youth
from birth to young adulthood.  In response to the varied and pressing needs
that have been shared with me and in celebration of the knowledge, skills, and
beautiful dreams that fill our city, CENTER: A Finding Voice Space is being
launched.  It builds on some of the Finding Voice Project work that took
place at Catalina Magnet High School between 2006-2014, but rather than being
housed at one school and serving only one student population, the idea is to
build and develop something sustainable in collaboration with the larger Tucson
community for all who wish to engage and all who can benefit from our work to
transform the educational landscape for linguistically and culturally diverse
learners.  This is an entirely new world for me - and an exciting journey
to be on with you.  Imagine all refugee, immigrant, and globally-minded
education stakeholders in Tucson connecting in one powerful, dynamic, and
creative network.  That is who we will be and what CENTER will
become.  Contribute today to this collective and collaborative adventure!   Thank you!!
What We Need & What You Get
As a
start-up we are in need of just about everything, but because we are lean and
flexible, we will make this happen on whatever scale is possible during our
initial launch.  The more you give, the
more we can develop and offer – but have no fear because this is happening and
it’s going to be amazing thanks to people like you!

The Impact
Your contribution will mean that:

Students new to our country,
     many of whom are learning English and trying to adjust to a very different
     and often challenging environment, will have a safe haven – a place they
     can relax, be themselves, nurture their talents and interests, and find
     support to help them thrive personally and academically.
Parents and family members
     of refugee and immigrant pK-12 students will have a place to go to learn
     more about the U.S. (and AZ) schooling system, to ask questions about the
     many school documents they receive, to learn about early childhood
     literacy and numeracy practices, to discover ways they can support their
     child to complete schoolwork, and to build connections with teachers and
     school staff in ways that are comfortable, positive, and enduring.
Teachers, administrators,
     and school staff will have a space for collaborative planning, to learn
     more about refugee resettlement and global realities, to hone their skills
     through professional development offerings to work more effectively with
     culturally and linguistically diverse learners, and to find the support,
     recognition, leadership opportunities, and community they need to do their
     best work in their schools and classrooms.
Refugee resettlement case
     managers and other agency staff will be able to provide newly arriving
     families with a calendar of educational events and supports that they can
     immediately take part in, as well as help their clients understand how and
     where to find help related to educational concerns.
Community partners will be
     able to connect with the wonderfully diverse residents of Tucson and
     develop new and exciting projects to enliven our city, help us all grow
     personally and professionally, and build a stronger foundation for our collective
     development and the future of our region.

Risks & Challenges
We are a small team, but mighty!  We
have been working in the education and refugee resettlement fields for many
years, and we have a lively, intelligent, and committed board to help us
understand and overcome obstacles that arise. 
This is a project we are building with the idea of systems change and sustainability
in mind.  We are using a collective
impact – or collaborative development – model. 
All of these aspects of our organization and our work make us
responsive, flexible, strong, and able to weather storms that may arise.
Other Ways You Can Help
Sometimes funds are tight on the home-front. 
We get that!  But don’t fret.  Because you have read this far, we know you
want to help get this project off the ground. 
Here are some other ways to help: 


Get the word out and make some noise about this
campaign and CENTER.  Use the Indiegogo
share tools or whatever social media (and traditional media) tools you love.

Host a dinner party and tell your friends/family
about this project – encourage them to give if they are able.
Contact us for volunteer opportunities or to make
     donations of useful items for CENTER and for our community of learners.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Erika, I'm Italo Australian and I love Lake Como. I have a lovely <i>casetta </i>- Italian for 'my cozy place', on Italian Lake Como village <i>Azzano</i>. I now live in Australia and I only visit Lake Como once a year - my <i>casetta</i> feels lonely! I'd like to put the apartment on <a href=""https://www.airbnb.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Airbnb</a> and share it with the rest of the world. Only problem is - it needs renovation. It's got major water stains on the ceiling, the electrical system is old, and the paint job is shocking - well, it's 110 years old!<br/></p>
<p>Here's my idea: if you can support the project financially, once it's ready you can come and stay at my <i>casetta </i>- check out accommodation availability using the <a href=""https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/boviotqbqrs8tciipnq076p87k%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/lake-como-casetta-renovation/edit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/boviotqbqrs8tciipnq076p87k%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/boviotqbqrs8tciipnq076p87k%40group.calendar.google.com/private-4074171865cad971f8fa53f39fd2655c/basic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=boviotqbqrs8tciipnq076p87k%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Australia/Brisbane%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=boviotqbqrs8tciipnq076p87k%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Australia/Brisbane%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CASETTA Calendar</a>. You can stay for one night or several nights, according to how much you contribute (see Crowdfunding Perks for more info).</p>
<p>If you cannot travel to Italy, but you are interested in language learning, I can offer you Italian classes online - I'm a qualified teacher with a PhD in language teaching  (my LinkedIn profile <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/erika-piazzoli/72/513/805"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>).

I am travelling to one of the poorest towns in Uganda called Tororo to build clay ovens as part of a SAFE Foundation charity project. We will work together with the community so that they can make, bake and sell their own bread and utilise these new skills to build further ovens in the future.
SAFE Foundation are committed to improving the quality of life in Tororo and it means a lot to me to be included in this project. As I am good at hand building, it feels right to lend these skills to help others.
About MeI'm from Porthcawl and have studied, lived and worked in Cardiff for 7 years. Art and music are my passion. 
I participated in Live Below The Line as well as practiced my newly acquired face-painting skills at a local community fair for SAFE this year. I've also raised funds for Oxfam by staging an Oxjam event in Cardiff.
What I need and what you get
£1000 - This money will pay for return flights, transport, accommodation, food, training and materials for the project.
Even if it's just £1 that you can give, I'd be really grateful!! Every penny counts!There are also some perks available for specific donation amounts if you fancy any of them. Check them out :)

Risks & Challenges
There's no doubt that it will be challenging to raise funds but I will be keeping people informed of my progress and work hard to show you that I mean it. 
If anyone wants help clearing a garden or windows washed, dogs walked (I'm great with dogs), snakes petted, etc., and would like to contribute a few pounds or more in return towards my part in this project, please let me know :)

<p>MyFlow.co is currently raising 25,000 dollars. Matt is the only employee right now. </p>
<p>To switch back to first person mode, I've used nearly all of my available money to build what we have today. There is so much more to build. And I need support. I absolutely refuse to get venture funding to keep MyFlow.co growing. </p>
<p>There are servers to keep alive, databases to feed, and rent to pay. The campaign is a flex-funding campaign, so any little bit helps. But there are stretch goals. This is also the strategic plan for MyFlow.co (competitors, take notes.)</p>

Users should be able to chat with each other. So chat's coming down the pipe. Remember that party you went to with your #bestie? Mom probably doesn't need to see that picture. So group flow is coming. Share with a sub section of friends and no one else.   Okay. Cool idea. What now?  MyFlow.co is open and functioning today. Make an account at myflow.co. Start following your friends. Start journaling. Start sharing. Start remembering. There's no invite system. There's no forced exclusivity. A network isn't fun unless you can talk to your friends. So start telling your friends!
Be aware though, it's just me right now.


Our servers might go down. Things might be unstable for a bit. But that's why we're funding.     
Speaking of Funding...

MyFlow.co is currently raising 25,000 dollars. Matt is the only employee right now. 
To switch back to first person mode, I've used nearly all of my available money to build what we have today. There is so much more to build. And I need support. I absolutely refuse to get venture funding to keep MyFlow.co growing. 
There are servers to keep alive, databases to feed, and rent to pay. The campaign is a flex-funding campaign, so any little bit helps. But there are stretch goals. This is also the strategic plan for MyFlow.co (competitors, take notes.)
Stretch Goals! 
50,000 - Faster iteration. 

I'll be able to hire another engineer to build a better and faster database system. We'll be able to get stable a lot quicker.
75,000 - MAKE IT PRETTY! 


We'll get some designers to give MyFlow.co a new look. Products deserve to look sexy. But looking sexy costs money.

100,000 - Dedicated Mobile Apps! 


Let's be real, dedicated iOS and Android apps are coming out eventually, if we hit 100k, we can push these apps out MUCH quicker.

250,000 - Curated content streams. 


MyFlow.co/music, MyFlow.co/film, MyFlow.co/art and more. We'll have dedicated feeds for the lean back consumers. Don't know what to follow? Want to discover awesome things? Curated streams will do that for you. We'll even approach the top curators out there, get them involved, and make sure curated streams are amazing. 

500,000 - Better Image Sharing 

We'll focus on making image sharing AMAZING, without the weird facial recognition.
1,000,000 - More than just images. 

We'll hire a few more engineers and focus on uploading more content than just images. Sound files? Maybe video? Woah.
2,000,000 - A Real Help Line

A comprehensive mental health, anti-harassment, and anti-bullying department. Sometimes we, as humans, just need someone to talk to. The internet can be a harsh place and everyone needs help sometimes. Eventually MyFlow.co will have a comprehensive crises line that people can use for free if they need help. Anti-harassment is so much more than blocking accounts. Social networks should do more to support their users. If we hit this goal. We'll be able to get that department running so much sooner.
Who's Behind MyFlow.co?

My name is Matt Watkajtys, I'm the founder of MyFlow.co - a brand new social sharing network that's designed to be privacy first and put you back in control. When I'm not building companies I work as an engineer. The last big startup I worked for was REDEF where I built out their custom content management system.
 I've put nearly everything I have into building an application that would allow me to share anything with the people I want to without being creepy.
MyFlow.co is designed with privacy in mind. Replace your bookmarks by remembering your favorite content. Share things with your friends. Never worry about data mining or data harvesting. MyFlow.co is a new social sharing network that puts you, your content, and your friends first.

Not convinced we need a new network?


They check your phone to see what apps you're using and how you're using them.
Their algorithms manipulate your emotions.
They scan your private messages to see what you share when you think you're secure.
Your friends or followers don't even get to see everything that you post.
They want to know when your birthday is to show you 'relevant content'. 
You can't hide from them. Facial recognition doesn't even need to see your face to auto-tag you. 
They slowly take away your ability to customize your profiles.
They selectively ban content that might make advertisers leery. #curvy
You're a product that's bought and sold. You're not a person, you're a monetizable asset. That's what this boils down to. That's the cost of free.
Some networks say 'F*** the status quo' only to become the status quo as they pull in 11 million dollars in venture capital funding.


Let's Do This Together
Sharing can be great again. Let's do it together. We'll build a great company. You get to have a say in what we build. You get to meet the team as we scale. You'll always know what's next. 

As a contributor, not only do you get to come in super cheap, but you'll always be part of MyFlow.co. We'll ask you for feedback. You'll always be part of our family. And if we can pull this off, we'll be the first 100% indepentently owned social network...ever.",5.0,5,"3 Campaigns

<p>We expect to face many of the standard challenges of setting up and running, or supporting a new business. Not only are there the better known components of successful enterprising to conquer, such as management, marketing and demographics, but we expect to be in the thick of significant social problems as well. We expect to work with various local experts on finding and developing creative solutions that overcome a myriad of issues like political and economic instability, social injustice, and statelessness, all the while generating profits and social benefits. This however, is the environment that we best enjoy working with... one that is diverse and energetic and riddled with challenges to turn into plentiful opportunities.</p>

Let's help Ms. Matos continue on her passionate journey as she provides food, clothing, and hope for the young and the elderly so desperately in need.

<p><b>THE PRING</b></p>
<p>William Pring was the customs surveyor for Hamilton in the 1850s - he and his large family moved frequently between Hamilton and Montreal, and it seems that he decided to invest in a large and impressive property on Mary Street, within walking distance of the Customs House. Maybe he intended to settle down for good, but it wasn’t to be - he had moved on to Port Colbourne by the early 1860s, and by 1871 his widow, Henrietta, had sold the property. </p>
<p>Between 1855 and today, the Pring House has changed ownership many times. Unlike many of the lovely architectural treasures in Hamilton, it has not had a great deal of continuity in its ownership and this has, unfortunately, led to much of its story being lost or obscured. From single-family residence to triplex, and several different business ventures, these stones have seen it all. </p>
<p>We bought the house in 2012. </p>
<p><b>THE HAMILTON GUESTHOUSE</b></p>
<p>The Hamilton Guesthouse opened in September, 2010, in a skinny Victorian 3-bedroom house on Victoria Avenue North. We weren’t sure if a backpackers’ hostel would work in Hamilton - there weren’t any here, after all, unlike Toronto and Niagara Falls, and several other nearby cities - so we started small. By February, we were regularly sold out. </p>
<p>People are coming to Hamilton, for business and pleasure, from all over the world. We were (and are!) absolutely thrilled to welcome them here to our friendly, informal hostel. But it was clear that we needed to move closer to downtown and get ourselves a larger property. We spent much of 2011 searching for the ideal location, inspecting and exploring, until we saw a FOR SALE sign in the front yard of the Pring. </p>
<p>Despite several competing offers, we were extraordinarily lucky to purchase the property, and we took possession in June, 2012. Our first guests (a group of ballerinas from Italy) arrived in July, and we have been here ever since. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In a house this old, with a history of so many different owners, it’s inevitable that there will be some fascinating (and occasionally terrifying) renovations. In the past three years, we’ve uncovered some truly creative plumbing, some interesting wall repairs, and many other things that we should write a book about! </p>
<p><b>OUR HOPES</b></p>
<p>There are many things that need our attention, but the most pressing is the electrical work. It’s not uncommon for our guests to trip a breaker, especially when we’re trying to run extra heating or cooling. We have three goals:</p>
<p>1. A new electrical service - an upgrade to 200Amp if necessary. - UPDATE: Horizon Utilities has arranged to move our electrical supply and upgrade our service.</p>
<p>2. Partial re-wiring of the house to remove malfunctioning and non-functioning switches, outlets and lights.</p>
<p>3. Addition of hard-wired emergency lighting and exit signs for guest safety. </p>
<p><b>YOUR REWARDS</b></p>
<p>We are extremely lucky to be able to offer several great perks. </p>
<p>$10 - A Hamilton Guesthouse pen, in an assortment of colours </p>
<p>$20 - Our personal thanks - a glossy postcard mailed to you. </p>

<p>$100 - A full season admission to <i>Things at the Pring</i>’s Sublime Saturday Series.</p>
<p>$100 - Private use of the Empire room for your party or event. </p>
<p>$250 - One night in the Henrietta room and a voucher for dinner at a local restaurant.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><b>HAMILTON NEEDS A HOSTEL</b></p>
<p>We believe that Hamilton’s reputation is enhanced by our business. Backpackers’ hostels are an ancient tradition, and they are increasingly popular for travellers throughout the world. Hostels allow guests to mingle in a way that is impossible in a standard hotel, and at a price point that makes it accessible to more people. Without this form of accommodation, Hamilton lacks the variety of choices available to tourists in other cities, and might miss out on visitors otherwise unable to travel.</p>
<p><b>THE HOSTEL NEEDS THE PRING</b></p>
<p>Having our home in the William Pring House means that travellers coming to Hamilton get to experience the history of the city first-hand. They can almost imagine what it would have been like to live here 160 years ago, and the changes that this old house has seen. We take our position as caretakers of this house very seriously, and have made it our mission to maintain it and treat it with the love and respect it deserves.</p>
<p><b>THE PRING NEEDS YOU</b></p>
<p>We’re often asked about how much financial support we receive to maintain this heritage property. Are we paid a stipend, is there some sort of grant? The answer is no: no grant, no money. The Hamilton Guesthouse is self-supporting, for the most part. Sometimes a major repair will require us to ask for help - and that’s what we’re doing now. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Of course, it could happen that our electricians start to work on the Pring and quickly discover that the amount of work is more than they’d anticipated. It happens - who knows what’s closed up in these walls? If we end up facing a situation where there is much more wrong than we’d budgeted for, we have a few options before us:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>We could prioritize the most important work and leave the rest for another time.</li>
<li>We could negotiate with our contractors to do labour (or other tasks for which we don’t need qualifications) for them, thus lowering the costs. </li>
<li>We could focus on just one part of the building and arrange to do the rest later. </li>
</ul>
<div>After five years of running a small business, we have trouble-shooting down to a fine art! We’re not afraid to put in the long hours, get our hands dirty, and do everything we can to make it work. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know what it’s like to have no money to give - obviously, or we wouldn’t be asking! The fact that you’ve given us this much of your time means so much to us, and we sincerely appreciate your support. </p>
<p>If you would like to share our campaign on your favourite social media, we would be extremely grateful. If you would like to share it in any other ways, we would be equally grateful! </p>

<p><strong>At this troubled time please help us to bring a Piece of Jordan to the UK this August at the amazing Greenbelt Music, Faith and Arts Festival</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is A Piece of Jordan? </strong></p>
<p>A Piece of Jordan wants you to know the real Jordan, the Jordan where people of all faiths live together, a Jordan that welcomes visitors from all walks of life and ensures they feel at home. With the unrest in the Middle East and the media coverage of the area, Jordan often gets painted with the same brush. We want to help change that.We want to challenge the stereotypes of the region and encourage people to visit Jordan - a land surrounded by sadness , but one that continues to show its strength, love and hospitality, striving for a better existence.</p>
<p>We have now been offered a stall at Greenbelt - a music, faith and arts festival in the UK, which has been running for over 40 years. Greenbelt has always represented diversity and equality and we are honored to have been accepted to exhibit our handicrafts and promote our country.</p>
<p>At Greenbelt we hope to have a beautiful range of Jordanian inspired handicrafts, all made in Petra using fair trade principals, created and produced by local artists and women’s groups.</p>
<p>We are working hard to engage with tourists who come to the area, taking them into the local community to eat, shop, harvest, cook and laugh with local families - experiencing Jordan through the eyes of local people. </p>
<p>At home we encourage our tourists to buy local and we are working on a number of community projects including a children's book series about the sites of Jordan titled, 'Laila and Habib - Adventures in Jordan' which will eventually help fund Petra's first children’s center and library.</p>
<p><strong>Who I am...</strong></p>
<p>Almost 11 years ago I came to Jordan as a tourist. Little did I know that a year later I would be leaving my home in Birmingham, UK to move my life to Jordan, get married and start on a wonderful adventure. From the word go I was often asked the question ""Is it safe?""  When people ask me this question, I want them to come and meet the people I know! The people who have accepted me into their hearts despite at times us being so different. Jordan is not only phenomenal in its beauty but also it's culture, the people and their warm, unconditional hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>What now?</strong></p>
<p>To support out work, we need to work at promoting Jordan outside of the region, to reach a  wider audience, give our talented artisans a new outlet for their products and let the stories of Jordan shine.</p>
<p>For towns like Petra, which for so long flourished from tourism, the dramatic drop of visitors to the region, means times are tough. Our handicrafts offer a new type of employment, create opportunities and the encourage creativity.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need your help! As a small community project the costs of doing the stall, shipping the products and getting a member of staff over to the UK to represent A Piece of Jordan and ones we are not yet in the position to cover all of.</p>
<p>How much do we need?</p>
<p>Well, we are currently in talks with the local authority who are keen to support us in some way. The total costs are below but we are only trying to raise a third of the funds through this crowdfunding campaign. </p>
<p><strong>Shipping</strong> - the space we have been offered is 4m by 4m.  In order to be able to ship enough products we are estimating the freight cost to be between 700-1000 GBP. Although we are working at getting this sponsored.</p>
<p><strong>Stall</strong> - the stall costs 580 GBP and includes passes for two members of staff (one of whom will be a volunteer from the UK)</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong> - 1000 GBP - this will include products from other local charitable societies</p>
<p><strong>Travel Expenses</strong> - 800 GBP - this will cover flights for one member of staff and a rented van for the weekend of the festival. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal and have to change our plans the money raised will go towards employing more local artists so we can continue to build up our stock and create our pieces of Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p> Jordan's beauty and warmth must be celebrated, for it tells the tales of people in a land often scarred by stories of its neighbours. By participating in this crowdfunding campaign you are helping to challenge stereotypes, show the world what Jordan really has to offer and contribute to a project that is creating new and exciting opportunities for both visitors and locals.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Whilst money helps, there is lots more you can do, if you are unable to contribute financially but love what we are trying to do we would love you to get in touch - share the campaign, our website and tell more people to visit Jordan. </p>

At Greenbelt we hope to have a beautiful range of Jordanian inspired handicrafts, all made in Petra using fair trade principals, created and produced by local artists and women’s groups.
We are working hard to engage with tourists who come to the area, taking them into the local community to eat, shop, harvest, cook and laugh with local families - experiencing Jordan through the eyes of local people. 
At home we encourage our tourists to buy local and we are working on a number of community projects including a children's book series about the sites of Jordan titled, 'Laila and Habib - Adventures in Jordan' which will eventually help fund Petra's first children’s center and library.
Who I am...
Almost 11 years ago I came to Jordan as a tourist. Little did I know that a year later I would be leaving my home in Birmingham, UK to move my life to Jordan, get married and start on a wonderful adventure. From the word go I was often asked the question ""Is it safe?""  When people ask me this question, I want them to come and meet the people I know! The people who have accepted me into their hearts despite at times us being so different. Jordan is not only phenomenal in its beauty but also it's culture, the people and their warm, unconditional hospitality.
What now?
To support out work, we need to work at promoting Jordan outside of the region, to reach a  wider audience, give our talented artisans a new outlet for their products and let the stories of Jordan shine.
For towns like Petra, which for so long flourished from tourism, the dramatic drop of visitors to the region, means times are tough. Our handicrafts offer a new type of employment, create opportunities and the encourage creativity.
What We Need & What You Get
We need your help! As a small community project the costs of doing the stall, shipping the products and getting a member of staff over to the UK to represent A Piece of Jordan and ones we are not yet in the position to cover all of.
How much do we need?
Well, we are currently in talks with the local authority who are keen to support us in some way. The total costs are below but we are only trying to raise a third of the funds through this crowdfunding campaign. 
Shipping - the space we have been offered is 4m by 4m.  In order to be able to ship enough products we are estimating the freight cost to be between 700-1000 GBP. Although we are working at getting this sponsored.
Stall - the stall costs 580 GBP and includes passes for two members of staff (one of whom will be a volunteer from the UK)
Stock - 1000 GBP - this will include products from other local charitable societies
Travel Expenses - 800 GBP - this will cover flights for one member of staff and a rented van for the weekend of the festival. 
If we do not reach our goal and have to change our plans the money raised will go towards employing more local artists so we can continue to build up our stock and create our pieces of Jordan.
The Impact
 Jordan's beauty and warmth must be celebrated, for it tells the tales of people in a land often scarred by stories of its neighbours. By participating in this crowdfunding campaign you are helping to challenge stereotypes, show the world what Jordan really has to offer and contribute to a project that is creating new and exciting opportunities for both visitors and locals.
Other Ways You Can Help
Whilst money helps, there is lots more you can do, if you are unable to contribute financially but love what we are trying to do we would love you to get in touch - share the campaign, our website and tell more people to visit Jordan.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael and I stared Stregare Cheesecake Company in the spring of 2012 after a rigorous 2011 holiday baking schedule fulfilling cheesecake orders for friends, family and co-workers.  We had been searching for an outlet for our passion to create high quality delicious food for our community and we realized there was a need and potential market for quality cheesecake, made with local ingredients and available custom made to order.</p>
<p>We started working with wedding clients in 2013 and expanded our flavor offerings and size options significantly in just a few short years.  Our product is unique and our customization service is perhaps the most unique thing that I have seen on the market.  Although we typically do some of our most memorable custom work for brides and grooms, we can make a cake special for any occasion.</p>
<p>We have had a great time getting to serve brides and grooms, moms and dads, graduates, co-workers and everyone in between.  We feel that no two orders are the same because everyone is different.  Although we do enjoy creating unique custom cakes there is one thing that never changes and that is the consistent quality of our product.</p>
<p>In 2015 we purchased 5 acres in Bastrop, TX and started raising our own chickens.  I'm proud to say that as of December of 2015 we have been able to supply our whole operation with our very own chicken eggs!  We also take every opportunity to source local fresh ingredients when we can, especially when it comes to fruits, berries and nuts for our cakes.  We're just picky like that!</p>
<p>When we purchased our land in 2015 we dreamed of someday converting one of the storage buildings into our very own commercial kitchen space.  We never thought we’d need that space so desperately, so fast!  We have added new wholesale and retail clients and are projected to run out of room in our current rental kitchen space before the end of this year as a busy Fall and holiday season loom ever closer.</p>
<p>With our own kitchen space, we intend to grow beyond the Austin market and expand into the Dallas, San Antonio and Houston markets as well.  We receive calls from individuals and companies all over the U.S. asking if we ship.  With our own dedicated kitchen space, we will have the room and equipment needed to ship out of state and intend to open up our shipping options throughout the US.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Michael and I are excited to take this company to the next level!  In order to build our own commercial kitchen on our property we will need to finish-out one of our storage buildings.  This unit is a metal building with about 1400 sq feet of space, a dirt floor and electric.  The money raised in this campaign will go to the following finish-out needs:</p>
<p>Concrete floor ($5,000) – Poured and graded with plumbing/drains installed</p>
<p>Septic system ($10,000) – The kitchen will need its own septic system to meet health code requirements for Bastrop County.</p>
<p>Plumbing &amp; Electrical ($9,000)</p>
<p>Ceiling and inside wall finish out ($19,000) – A ceiling will be created and inside walls will need to be framed up, insulated, sheet rock and FRP installed.</p>
<p>HVAC system ($4,000) – Energy efficient units to help control and maintain temperature and humidity will be installed.</p>
<p>If we do not quite reach our goal in this campaign, we will apply the funds in the order of items listed above, with the concrete floor being the first thing we need to facilitate.  Depending on what we lack in funds we will either run an additional campaign to acquire more funds or seek a home improvement/home equity loan for the remainder of the funding.  Because the building is on residential property, the finish-out construction is not eligible for a commercial loan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>What You Get</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have developed some great perks to reward our supporters and will have most of them available just in time for the holidays!<span>  We have come up with some great t-shirt concepts that will help you show your support as well as calendars, magnets and other useful every-day items.  For those wishing to try our cakes, you can do so at a certain donation level – however, those shipments will have to wait until we have the kitchen project completed.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A dedicated commercial kitchen space will provide more room for equipment and prep space needed to increase our production and expand our product line. </p>
<p>We are currently an online only store and require at least 24 hours notice for all orders.  However, we are partnering with local establishments in Austin (and soon hopefully in other cities) to provide a place where our customers can pick up their orders at a time convenient to them as opposed to only having a delivery option.  At this time, we can only offer limited delivery to our customers in and around the greater Austin area. </p>
<p>We are also looking to expand our product line from delicious cheesecakes and cookies to more traditional pastries which would offer our customers more options.  We plan to partner with Amazon, Favor, Drop Off and other companies offering similar services for expanded delivery options once we are established in a dedicated kitchen space where we can expand our production capacity.</p>
<p>Our business has doubled in gross sales every year and year 4 is looking great so far.  You can currently find our cakes at Piney Creek Chophouse and The View in Bastrop, and River City Market and Il Forte in Austin.  Once we have the kitchen capacity to expand our production we will solicit partnerships with more Austin establishments and seek similar alliances in the DFW, Houston and San Antonio markets.</p>
<p>We are also very excited to have more space for needed equipment such as a blast freezer and freezer space which will allow us to freeze and ship our cakes across the country.  This is not something we can do in our current rental kitchen space.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This endeavor to create our own commercial kitchen is a huge undertaking and one that we know will be very challenging – but ultimately the best thing for our company’s future.<span>  We are not asking for help with equipment purchases as we own most of what we need and are looking to apply for a loan through PeopleFund for the remainder.  Being a 100% woman owned business our company can take advantage of some great offers made to minority business owners such as 3% APR and lower percent closing fees on loans to small businesses.  If we raise more money beyond what is needed for the construction of the kitchen then we will most certainly put it towards any additional equipment we need.</span></p>
<p>We know that the market is ever changing and evolving and we are at the mercy of our customers when it comes to maintaining income, so we are pursuing more wholesale business to stabilize our cash flow.<span>  It is our strong belief that having the kitchen as a working part of our residential homestead will allow us to maintain better control over this investment no matter what the market may bring.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><p>We know that not everyone that wants to help can contribute financially – and that’s OK!<span>  We want your help anyway!  If you can spread the word about our campaign that helps!  If you can help us connect with retail and wholesale partners that may be interested in our products and services – that helps!  If you can offer services that may help us get up and running (plumbing, electric etc.) we are more than happy to talk to you about helping.  Any help you can give means the world to us!</span></p><p> </p></div>","Short Summary

This endeavor to create our own commercial kitchen is a huge undertaking and one that we know will be very challenging – but ultimately the best thing for our company’s future.  We are not asking for help with equipment purchases as we own most of what we need and are looking to apply for a loan through PeopleFund for the remainder.  Being a 100% woman owned business our company can take advantage of some great offers made to minority business owners such as 3% APR and lower percent closing fees on loans to small businesses.  If we raise more money beyond what is needed for the construction of the kitchen then we will most certainly put it towards any additional equipment we need.
We know that the market is ever changing and evolving and we are at the mercy of our customers when it comes to maintaining income, so we are pursuing more wholesale business to stabilize our cash flow.  It is our strong belief that having the kitchen as a working part of our residential homestead will allow us to maintain better control over this investment no matter what the market may bring.

Other Ways You Can Help
 
We know that not everyone that wants to help can contribute financially – and that’s OK!  We want your help anyway!  If you can spread the word about our campaign that helps!  If you can help us connect with retail and wholesale partners that may be interested in our products and services – that helps!  If you can offer services that may help us get up and running (plumbing, electric etc.) we are more than happy to talk to you about helping.  Any help you can give means the world to us!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p>As you may already know, Twain’s closed it's doors on Monday, March 16th to protect you, our staff and the greater population from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was the most difficult decision we have ever made, but it is one that we felt was necessary for the common good, and to ensure our ability to eat, drink and laugh in the future at Twain’s.</p>
<p>We have created this campaign as a way for you to make plans to join us for some food and fun on the other side of this crisis. We are offering a number of *perks* at a discount, from simple gift cards to a party with friends, as well as a few unique experiences that you can purchase now and redeem once we are open again. Your support in this way will help insure that we can re-open quickly when the time is right. </p>
<p>We have always felt blessed to be a part of Decatur’s community. Thank you for all of your support, it has been nearly 25 years and we plan to come back soon to celebrate that milestone.</p>
<p>ABOVE ALL…please stay healthy…listen to the experts and stay home. The welfare of our community is at stake and you are the most important piece. Be well, and take care of each other (at a safe distance). It will take many more sacrifices by each of us to get to the end of this crisis safely. We look forward to raising a glass at that time.</p>

~theChangeJar team




""Utilizing micro-transactions and smartphones, theChangejar empowers its users to pay off debt quickly and effectively. After evaluating the individual user's finances, theChangejar uses a personalized daily amount the user can afford to
spend towards debt each day. Then it sets up those daily payments towards the payoff, all the while
avoiding compounding interest! This process can save
users, on average, $1,500 in interest on individual debts. All while accelerating
payoff time by 60% on average. ""

Everyone has experienced the weight of debt and theChangejar is an expression of the wisdom of Albert Einstein for smartphone users:
“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.” ~Albert Einstein
What that means to  you, our contribution base, is simply this; we are providing a one time opportunity to have early or unlimited access to our easy to use financial planning and micro-transaction system.  
After this we will be implementing normal app cost structures for our operation's and R&D budget in which you will continue to benefit from at no additional cost. 
Below are some reading materials and introductory articles.

What a contribution means to us at 

Your contributions help prepare us for a final push to the banks.  We want to give you the best chance at paying off your debt with as little impact to your pocketbook as possible. Thankfully our app framework, as you saw above, is already near completion. Helping fund our campaign furthers our efforts and establishes theChangejar as a method the banks will accept towards a debt reduction strategy. Initial funding will be utilized in 6 areas:


Auto sync of details associated with accounts & debts
Credit score API integration

Connecting banks for cheaper transfer of funds costs (potential reduction of ACH fees)

Creation of a larger awareness campaign

Additional innovations such as variable rates and more advanced money growth methods


Hiring of staff for full time work at improving the look/feel/ usability of the app





The Impact

 Every contribution emphsises  to the staff at Xclr8tech  the importance of theChangejar to help those around us out of debt. Your donation regardless of size  secures further conversations with banks to acknowledge the need for such advancements in technology to benefit everyone.  After all if banks can accrue interest daily (including weekends) we should be allowed to pay daily as well. 
We want everyone to be debt free and to feel the success of having done it on their own. Our app was designed with that exact purpose in mind. Providing individuals a sense of real accomplishment and self worth while mastering the art of personal finance. 
Our hope is to decrease the tension and to reduce, or eliminate, the arguments that happen between family about debt and finances.

The Initial Case Study

The initial results of the full alpha app test resulted in our staff seeing a significant reduction in what was owed on our own debts. After we saw our own success, we tested its stability against the size of the entire US Personal debt economy.  We reviewed the national data and realized that after taking household averages from the 2014 US census our conclusion was simple: 
If every household spent $50 a day towards their debt, this country's population would be debt free just under 5 years. Which, on average, each household has the potential to afford. 
We gathered the estimated totals of three types of personal debt from the national database (listed below) and plugged them into our app. With the app, we calculated that the nation would save a total of $7 trillion in interest paid to the banking industry over that period of five years. Yeah, $7 trillion.
Below are the numbers we gathered and used to calculate this:


Credit Card Debts - $890,900,000,000


Student loans -       $1,190,000,000,000


Mortgages -             $8,170,000,000,000


Our goal is to make debt disappear, and then help those that use our app to never again let it get this critical. Because we make the payments daily, we alleviate the capitalizing compound interest on these debts thus stopping the growth almost in its tracks. 


Risks & Challenges

 Everyone is afraid of talking about debt, or about personal finances. That should not be the case. We shouldn't be afraid of debt. We should face it openly and take a step to make the difference, but we also understand that with any new idea there is always a risk. In our case though, we see that risk as minimal. 
The factors that are in our favor are as follows:
The CEO Kris Kitchens is a veteran (USMC) and has continuously challenged our team to overcome the constraints we are handed and deliver above and beyond. His desire to see this project through has helped us overcome obstacles such as early app deployment, utilization of the cloud, and setting us up as a corporation(Xclr8Tech). Kris works tirelessly as we all do, to ensure the success of our dreams: a company that puts forth products that uplift the population we are surrounded by.  
Each of our backgrounds which you will find here on our bio page has prepared us to bring the best we have to offer forward. 
Please keep in mind that none of us are super wealthy, we do not hold positions of significance in our everyday jobs but what we share most in common with everyone reading this is debt and the desire to make it stop. That has been our driving force and that is where theChangejar came from.
    If you are unable to contribute, what should you do?
Simple, communicate this opportunity to others, repost, (Like) our app page on Facebook, or repin it on Pinterest. The strongest thing anyone can do is spread the word, it saves Kris a lot of time talking to complete strangers about the app.In short we all should do the opposite of what everyone typically does, and talk about debt.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">RIAC does not get any consistent funding, and pays for all operations with donations, fundraising initiatives, and applying for grants. This is the first time that RIAC has ever tried crowd-funding. Let's see how it goes!</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We have a staff of three plus two full-time volunteers, and over 100 part-time and casual volunteers. We are currently operating on the third floor of 204 Water Street, which contains our office spaces, and our ESL classroom. We often host forums, large sessions, and social events, for which we often have to rent external spaces to accommodate our 400 members. We have been happily in our space for over 16 years but have been steadily outgrowing it. This fall, we want to branch out and grow, to serve not only newcomers but the entire St. John's Metro Community! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h3>What's the Plan?</h3></div>
<div>THIS IS A ONE IN A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY! The second floor of our building has become vacant, and we want to occupy it!  Along with our already-established Social Justice Center on the third floor, this initiative will nearly double our space, and infinitely affect the kind, quantity and quality of service that we can provide to our members. To help make this idea sustainable we are going to rent out these new spaces to the entire St. John's Community, providing some much-needed, affordable community spaces: a Conference Room, a Community Room, and a Child-Minding Centre! and we will get some income and more exposure of our work.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The conference room will allow us to hold forums, larger information sessions, and more classes on our own turf, saving us a lot of money in venue rental fees, equipment, transportation and catering costs.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The community room will allow us to hold social events and fun activities for our after school program set to start in September 2016. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The most impact for our members will come from the Child-Minding Centre, which newcomer parents can use for free, to come to our classes, information sessions, advice programs, and training activities. Many newcomers don't have extended family or funds for babysitters, and therefore not easy avail of our services, which can<span style=""background-color: initial;""> lead to isolation, missing growth opportunities, solving day to day problems, be informed and more. Having a child-minding centre will break down barriers, and provide amazing new opportunities for newcomer parents. The child-minding centre can also be used by any member of the community who is renting another of our community spaces for an event. Everyone wins!</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Having these spaces that can be used, not just by newcomers, but the whole community will help us to build a welcoming, participatory and multicultural community that can be celebrated by all! This extra space will mean that we won't just serve refugees and immigrants in this city, but we can open our doors and our hands for start-ups, community groups, arts activities, public forums, and even other not-for-profits. Also, there is a real need for these affordable spaces downtown, and we can't wait to meet the interesting people who would like to use them.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;"">:</span>
</h3>
<div>We are raising money to get this amazing initiative started! We need to renovate the second floor: knock out walls and put up others, rip out old carpet and put in a new floor, paint the walls, purchase new tables, chairs, whiteboards and a projector, and toys and supplies for the child-minding center. We also need to paint and beautify the outside of our building, and put up a new sign, to draw people into our new community spaces. We need to create a permanent position for a promoter and service provider. We will need the money to rent the space while it is being renovated, and not generating revenue. We will also be using funds to create promotional materials and advertising so that we can spread the word about these beautiful, new, affordable spaces that will be available for anyone in the metro area!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>There is a real lack of affordable community space in St. John's right now, and this initiative can strengthen our community at a time when the provincial budget has us all a little squeezed! Contributing to this initiative isn't just investing in RIAC, it's investing in other small not-for-profits, charities, and start-ups that can use our spaces for rates that won't break the bank! Investing in RIAC is investing in parents, children, artists, grassroots movements, and in people just like you and me! You can be a big part in creating an involved, multi-cultural, inclusive, inviting, and creative community. How great is that?</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As with any expansion, there are going to be hurdles! We will eventually need to hire a new staff member to manage this new space. We will need permits and blessings<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> from our landlord and from our downstairs neighbors every step of the way. We will need community partners, supporters, and friends to lift us up while we scramble to get all of this done, but we KNOW we can do it!</span></p>
<p>When RIAC started 30 years ago, it was a tiny one table ""office"" at the back of a craft store. Moving into our own office space was just as daunting. Hiring more staff is always daunting. Facing huge influxes of refugees in times of crisis has been daunting too! However, we have overcome every hurdle, grown and persevered. We are more active now in the community than we ever have been, and our potlucks and our ESL classes are so full of people that we are almost out of room! To grow is not even a choice, it is inevitable. We are simply trying to grow in the most gracious, economical, and healthy way possible: Incorporating our whole community, and opening our doors to the city at large!</p>

<p>Dirty Job Brewing is a small craft brewery started by 3 partners (Derek, Lashawn, and Justin) that all come from various backgrounds in education, business, manufacturing, and construction. The brewery is in Historic Downtown Mansfield, TX. As part of the revitalization movement of Historic Downtown Mansfield, we are set to open our doors on Main St. and help solidify the movement's foundation. This is our dream. To bring a new level of craft beer brewing to North Texas and use as many locally-sourced ingredients as possible! We know it is hard work and we are ready to get this Dirty Job done! We love North Texas and we love craft beer. We want to give back to both communities with quality products and a warm hospitality in our taproom. We are extremely thankful to all who have believed in us all the way and look forward to giving back! IT'S A DIRTY JOB AND YOU CAN HELP BREW IT!</p>

<p>We will have our taproom and brewery separated in the building so we can brew freely any time of day and still be open to the public from 4p - 12am Tuesday through Friday and 12pm - 12am Saturday. Located near many wonderful developments such as Mellow Mushroom Pizza, a future Twisted Root Burger, Steven's Garden Grill, Big D BBQ, and many more; the one thing Mansfield is under served in is craft beer! You can help us end that!</p>
<p><strong>FREE BEER!!!</strong></p>
<p>We have crossed a multitude of barriers so far, but encountered a few unexpected hurdles as well. We are seeking $20,000 and decided to have this campaign to bolster our opening capital and have a larger brewhouse as well as more fermentation ability. We chose to roll with a 7bbl system which is approximately 217 gallon capacity as this will allow us to brew in larger batches and keep pace with demand. We will be able to have new brews out faster while also be able to distribute to some DFW locations regularly. We will also be using our 1.5bbl (46.5 gallons) ""Research and Dirtvelopement"" system to frequently create new and experimental brews in smaller batches.</p>

<p>You can also get FREE BEER FOR LIFE! Just check out the list of awesome get-backs you can be rewarded with!</p>

<h3>About Baby Bat Beauty</h3>
<p>My name is Amanda Wolfson and I started this company almost a year ago while I was a senior at Drexel University as a fun way to express my creativity by helping other people express theirs through makeup! The lack of affordable cruelty-free makeup had many of my friends frustrated which sparked the idea to sell my creations. Our cosmetics and beauty products are all handmade with love for a price that won't break the bank. By using high-end cruelty free, and often vegan ingredients, in a few short months we have turned this little company into something great. Now we need your help to put Baby Bat Beauty on the map - literally! We need custom packaging to help upgrade our look. It will help us comply with international laws so we can be sold in stores across the world! Not only that, custom packaging helps us compete with the larger chemical-ridden brands that are widely available today!</p>

<p>Manufacturers require us to purchase a large bulk quantity of each item which significantly increases the upfront investment. For many small businesses like ours, this can be one major hurdle which prevents us from competing with the big brands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe strongly in the quality of each of our ingredients as well as the quality of our products. We also believe that animal testing is inhumane, and yet many makeup brands still continue this practice. We've developed quality, handmade products that are all cruelty-free and PETA certified. Most of our products are also 100% vegan. The result? Our products are higher quality than brands you can find at Sephora, and yet cost as much as drugstore brands.</p>
<p>We don't use fillers and harsh chemicals to cheapen our products like other brands! All of our beauty products are formulated without talc, mineral oil, petrolatum, parabens, phthalates, SLS, gluten, and most of our products are also vegan. This is great for anyone with sensitive skin or those who have allergies to many common ingredients in mainstream makeup products.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<h3>Welcome to Live at Marvins Garden</h3>
<p>We want to build a grassroots venue in #yeg to support the growth and vibrant community of live arts and culture. </p>
<p>We (Mark Bellows &amp; Ryan Brodziak from The Local Omnivore and Steve Derpack of JCL Productions) are teaming up to show the rest of Canada what Edmonton is really made of when it comes to the live arts and culture scene. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Picture this: An intimate 150 person venue serving the whole range of live arts &amp; culture by offering a fresh and functional space for events including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Live musical performances from all genres </li>
<li>DJ dance parties</li>
<li>Theatre &amp; dance productions</li>
<li>Comedy shows</li>
<li>Film screenings </li>
<li>Poetry slams, literary events</li>
<li>Conferences &amp; workshops</li>
</ul>
<p>The bonus is, we will also endeavour to preserve history, repurpose and recycle as many materials as we can when we build the space. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>[Original Drawing of Potential Layout for Marvins Garden] </strong></p>
<p>We want the vibe to be welcoming, open-minded, and respectful. Our focus will be on ensuring artists feel their creativity flourishing. We believe in fair wages and are mindful of the unique differences in this industry our staff face. Basically, we want to create a place for all. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $190,000 in order to build and start the operations for Marvins Garden. The funds raised will be used for: </p>
<ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>[Budget - In Cost-Savings Graphic Design Version] </strong></p>

We want to build a grassroots venue in #yeg to support the growth and vibrant community of live arts and culture. 
We (Mark Bellows & Ryan Brodziak from The Local Omnivore and Steve Derpack of JCL Productions) are teaming up to show the rest of Canada what Edmonton is really made of when it comes to the live arts and culture scene. 
Picture this: An intimate 150 person venue serving the whole range of live arts & culture by offering a fresh and functional space for events including:

Live musical performances from all genres 
DJ dance parties
Theatre & dance productions
Comedy shows
Film screenings 
Poetry slams, literary events
Conferences & workshops

The bonus is, we will also endeavour to preserve history, repurpose and recycle as many materials as we can when we build the space. 

[Original Drawing of Potential Layout for Marvins Garden] 
We want the vibe to be welcoming, open-minded, and respectful. Our focus will be on ensuring artists feel their creativity flourishing. We believe in fair wages and are mindful of the unique differences in this industry our staff face. Basically, we want to create a place for all. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need $190,000 in order to build and start the operations for Marvins Garden. The funds raised will be used for: 

Permits, Fees, & Leases
Building & Construction Materials
Start-Up Operations 


[Budget - In Cost-Savings Graphic Design Version] 
In order to raise this amount, we've come up with some really unique, and exciting rewards with promoting the future community in mind. 
Rewards like a VIP weekend at the Edmonton Music Awards and custom paintings created in homage to your favourite music album. Plus, one-of-a-kind swag and recognition on our backer wall of fame. 


[Examples of some of the posters available in the rewards. Yes, that's Connor McDavid - the piece is called ""Connor McPortrait"" and it was painted by local artist Lauren Hunter.] 
What Marvins Garden Means to the Community
We want to build Marvins Garden in order to:

Create a healthy urban ecology;
Serve as an innovation hub and incubation space for artists; and to
Support the growth of Edmonton's live arts & culture scene

Every artist who has ""made it,"" did so because of community venues like what we hope to build. The positive impact locally, nationally, and globally is priceless. 
We believe we can build and run a successful venue because we have done this before. Mark and Ryan built The Local Omnivore brick and mortar location by hand, and have been at the helm since the company started in 2012. Steve has been running his own successful entertainment agency for more than twelve years now. 
We believe we can do this, and need everyone in this amazing city to jump on board with us.

There are always risks & challenges associated with starting a business, the first hurdle is finding the capital to build the space and having all the necessary building and operating permits in place.

<p><strong>We know how much our children love to create…and now it just got easier.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>I am Prue Burnstein, Sydney designer and lover of all things handmade. I have worked in the fashion industry for nearly 20 years and have always loved designing children’s wear or art for their walls.  With two children of my own, I am more aware than ever the importance for children to explore the creative world around them; to explore and challenge what they see. I am endlessly inspired by the creativity of kids and I have always wanted to provide a beautiful, creative space for their imaginations to roam.</p>
<p>Based in the Inner West of Sydney, <strong>Paper</strong> <strong>Rock</strong> <strong>Scissors</strong> <strong>Art</strong> <strong>Studio</strong> is a new art space for children of all ages. Paper Rock Scissors Art Studios will provide an inspiring, thought provoking environment for children to explore their ideas, learn new techniques and work together on fun art-y projects. I am planning to offer so many amazing classes and events- the schedule is already packed!  I have finally found the home for my new studio and I need a little help to get things going.</p>
<p>Classes will run after school, weekends and school holidays.  Each class will be different with new techniques being explored and all art materials provided.</p>
<p>And, for the parents that work full time and feel guilty that they can never pick up their children from school to get them to these fun things (ME!!!)… they can finally relax… the <strong>Paper</strong> <strong>Rock</strong> <strong>Scissors</strong> <strong>Art</strong> <strong>VAN</strong> can pick children up from the local schools.   </p>
<p>This chapter for Paper Rock Scissors Art Studios begins in Term 1 of the school year 2018. Exciting (for me), fun(for them) and something for us all to look forward to.</p>
<p>I am launching my new adventure here on Indiegogo where your contributions will help me with all the costs associated with opening a new business, enable me to fix up and create the new space, help furnish and stock the studio, and run the van.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise $10,000 and there are so many great perks available! Essentially you are just pre-paying for items you will use: open studio visits, any of the classes, and art supplies.   And if you aren't local to the area, you are helping provide an awesome space in our neighbourhood for children to make art and learn new skills. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you cannot donate at this time, please share this campaign with your friends and family! Indiegogo has easy to use sharing tools that makes it easy to share our campaign with others. Also, just spread the word about our studio and come visit! Sign up for classes, weekends or holidays events- or just drop-in and make some art during weekend studio hours.</p>

<h3>Who is Idiom Brewing Co. and what are we about?</h3>
<p>Idiom Brewing Co. is Frederick, Maryland's newest addition to the rapidly growing craft beer scene, started by an avid brewer with a plan to produce handcrafted recipes that depart from typical approaches to the styles.  We've worked hard honing our skills and have invested all of our spare time and energy toward making this dream a reality.  We have a few lease options currently at our disposal, which we hope to finalize by the end of September.  We are currently working with a local bank on a SBA loan and hope to have that approved in the near future as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is simple --</p>
<p>We want to bring people from all walks together, to enjoy themselves and each other. Whether you seek out explosively juicy IPA’s; are adventurous and looking to try boozy, sour or complex flavors; or just because you’re looking to enjoy traditionally styled beer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Handcrafted beer is considerably more than the sum of its parts, and today's consumer is much more discerning and engaged in their selections.  Idiom Brewing Co. believes that brewing is a form of expression.  Our 'Expressions in Beer' will allow us to create new flavors, and new experiences, for our customers.  We strive to innovate by utilizing new and/or experimental hops, local ingredients, and unique flavor profiles in an attempt to stretch the limits of our imagination, and that of our customer's palette.  We hope our customers leave the brewery with a new found appreciation and knowledge for what possibilities still exist for craft beer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Opening a brewery comes with a hefty price tag. Because we have done this all on our own (up to this point) through our savings, we are left with a longer list of items than we have cash to support.  We know that many of you are passionate about beer (and us) and will consider becoming a supporter of this campaign.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a brewery with the intention of being a platform for advocacy, collaboration and community re-investment.  Your contributions will not only validate our mission, but your desire for more options and more flavor.  Ultimately your contribution will also help us realize our goal of being a local contender in Frederick, MD.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been blessed to have some awesome friends and family that have helped us along the way, but we need additional support, from you, to make this dream a reality.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>Idiom Brewing Co. hopes to increase its working capital to allow for the addition of 6 x 3.5 barrel stainless steel fermenters, and 6 x 3.5 barrel stainless steel serving tanks, to service our location in Frederick, MD.  Idiom Brewing Co. also requires additional funds for transfer pumps, a glycol cooling system and licensing. Any contributions above and beyond our goal, are extremely appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Idiom Brewing Co. requires an additional $35,700 in funding to acquire additional equipment to streamline production and offer quality products to our local customers.</li>
<li>Funds contributed from this campaign will first be used to purchase additional 3.5 barrel fermenters (approx. 6) and 3.5 barrel serving tanks (approx. 6) for our location in Frederick, MD.  Any additional funds collected from this campaign will be used to offset licensing costs, a glycol chilling system and transfer pumps.   </li>

</div></div>","Who is Idiom Brewing Co. and what are we about?
Idiom Brewing Co. is Frederick, Maryland's newest addition to the rapidly growing craft beer scene, started by an avid brewer with a plan to produce handcrafted recipes that depart from typical approaches to the styles.  We've worked hard honing our skills and have invested all of our spare time and energy toward making this dream a reality.  We have a few lease options currently at our disposal, which we hope to finalize by the end of September.  We are currently working with a local bank on a SBA loan and hope to have that approved in the near future as well.
 
Our goal is simple --
We want to bring people from all walks together, to enjoy themselves and each other. Whether you seek out explosively juicy IPA’s; are adventurous and looking to try boozy, sour or complex flavors; or just because you’re looking to enjoy traditionally styled beer.
 
Handcrafted beer is considerably more than the sum of its parts, and today's consumer is much more discerning and engaged in their selections.  Idiom Brewing Co. believes that brewing is a form of expression.  Our 'Expressions in Beer' will allow us to create new flavors, and new experiences, for our customers.  We strive to innovate by utilizing new and/or experimental hops, local ingredients, and unique flavor profiles in an attempt to stretch the limits of our imagination, and that of our customer's palette.  We hope our customers leave the brewery with a new found appreciation and knowledge for what possibilities still exist for craft beer.
 
Opening a brewery comes with a hefty price tag. Because we have done this all on our own (up to this point) through our savings, we are left with a longer list of items than we have cash to support.  We know that many of you are passionate about beer (and us) and will consider becoming a supporter of this campaign.  
 
We are a brewery with the intention of being a platform for advocacy, collaboration and community re-investment.  Your contributions will not only validate our mission, but your desire for more options and more flavor.  Ultimately your contribution will also help us realize our goal of being a local contender in Frederick, MD.
 
We have been blessed to have some awesome friends and family that have helped us along the way, but we need additional support, from you, to make this dream a reality.

 
To find out more about us, our philosophy and a little about our beer, visit http://www.idiombrewing.com.
 
What We Need & What You Get!
Idiom Brewing Co. hopes to increase its working capital to allow for the addition of 6 x 3.5 barrel stainless steel fermenters, and 6 x 3.5 barrel stainless steel serving tanks, to service our location in Frederick, MD.  Idiom Brewing Co. also requires additional funds for transfer pumps, a glycol cooling system and licensing. Any contributions above and beyond our goal, are extremely appreciated.

Idiom Brewing Co. requires an additional $35,700 in funding to acquire additional equipment to streamline production and offer quality products to our local customers.
Funds contributed from this campaign will first be used to purchase additional 3.5 barrel fermenters (approx. 6) and 3.5 barrel serving tanks (approx. 6) for our location in Frederick, MD.  Any additional funds collected from this campaign will be used to offset licensing costs, a glycol chilling system and transfer pumps.   

 

 
As a result of your contributions, you'll receive some pretty interesting, and rewarding, perks!
 
Some of those perks are in the form of physical items, such as stickers (for your car, mirror, guitar case, beer fridge or anything you feel needs a little decoration):

 
To t-shirts (to show your love for us and what we do):

 
Or growlers (to carry that sweet nectar home with you):

All items in 'Perk Packages' will be shipped, minus Growlers and Pint Glasses.  These will either need to be picked up at the Brewery or special arrangements made for shipping them (due to size and possibility of damage).
 

The Impact:
Your contributions will not only impact the ability for Idiom Brewing Co. to become a profitable business, but you'll also impact the local craft beer scene.  We plan to introduce some new twists on existing styles, as well as pioneer the creation of new styles or flavors.

Idiom Brewing Co. believes that creativity shows no boundaries, and that our only limits are those set by our imaginations.
We have been innovating new recipes for the better part of a decade, incorporating new hops, and new flavors, to provide unique experiences.
Idiom Brewing Co. will collaborate with other local breweries, distilleries and businesses to build a customer base not only for ourselves, but for other community businesses too.

 

Risks & Challenges:
There are always hurdles in business. Whether it be licensing, Local, State or Federal Government regulations, regional competition from big Corporations or the perception of the customer, there are always challenges. We believe, however, that challenges are meant to be overcome and that we have the skills and drive to do so.

I have a passion for working with young people, and I envision high school and college student interns, getting on-the-job training in news and feature writing, news and feature photography, sports writing and photography, graphic design and layout, editing, interviewing and writing skills—not to mention professional interaction and training in how to have a job and meet responsibilities.</p><p>Scholarships would be awarded once a year to high school students in the area The Independent covers, which includes six high schools altogether, two of them at charter schools. The scholarship would be for students interested in studying journalism, with a preference given for students pursuing print journalism. After the initial set-up, we would immediately begin fundraising efforts in the community to keep the foundation moving forward.</p><p><strong>Take Flight: Job Readiness</strong></p><p>I also have done initial planning for a job readiness program called Take Flight. The program will consist of an 8-week training, with a weekly session. Sessions will include job interview skills, resume writing, and basic computer skills. Other weeks would include a stylist working with local thrift stores to come up with suitable clothes for job-seeking; other volunteers would do a haircut and makeover. My idea is to make it fun. Having a person work one-on-one as a stylist, and by having thrift stores donate the clothing, we can demonstrate what can be done on a shoestring. By the same token, a makeover and haircut will give local hairdressers and makeup artists the chance to show off their skills and help a neighbor out at the same time. The program would involve lots of community members, and from my initial overtures, the response has been exceptionally positive. We would end the program with presentation of laptop computers so the participants can effectively look for jobs, and a ceremony to recognize the work they've done. Local business owners would help with interviewing skills and other job training.</p><p>I want to start this program because as my opportunities have expanded, I've grown by leaps and bounds through mentoring. I want to pay that forward into the community. Those people who have given so generously of their time over the years have helped me immeasurably. It would mean a lot to me to be able to bring that kind of possibility into someone else's life. My dream is to make it an annual program.</p><p><strong>Biz Buzz = B2B Support</strong></p><p>I have another idea I call Biz Buzz, which The Independent is already implementing. This is something I want to grow. Biz Buzz is business-to-business support on social media, and through marketing in general.

I have a passion for working with young people, and I envision high school and college student interns, getting on-the-job training in news and feature writing, news and feature photography, sports writing and photography, graphic design and layout, editing, interviewing and writing skills—not to mention professional interaction and training in how to have a job and meet responsibilities.Scholarships would be awarded once a year to high school students in the area The Independent covers, which includes six high schools altogether, two of them at charter schools. The scholarship would be for students interested in studying journalism, with a preference given for students pursuing print journalism. After the initial set-up, we would immediately begin fundraising efforts in the community to keep the foundation moving forward.Take Flight: Job ReadinessI also have done initial planning for a job readiness program called Take Flight. The program will consist of an 8-week training, with a weekly session. Sessions will include job interview skills, resume writing, and basic computer skills. Other weeks would include a stylist working with local thrift stores to come up with suitable clothes for job-seeking; other volunteers would do a haircut and makeover. My idea is to make it fun. Having a person work one-on-one as a stylist, and by having thrift stores donate the clothing, we can demonstrate what can be done on a shoestring. By the same token, a makeover and haircut will give local hairdressers and makeup artists the chance to show off their skills and help a neighbor out at the same time. The program would involve lots of community members, and from my initial overtures, the response has been exceptionally positive. We would end the program with presentation of laptop computers so the participants can effectively look for jobs, and a ceremony to recognize the work they've done. Local business owners would help with interviewing skills and other job training.I want to start this program because as my opportunities have expanded, I've grown by leaps and bounds through mentoring. I want to pay that forward into the community. Those people who have given so generously of their time over the years have helped me immeasurably. It would mean a lot to me to be able to bring that kind of possibility into someone else's life. My dream is to make it an annual program.Biz Buzz = B2B SupportI have another idea I call Biz Buzz, which The Independent is already implementing. This is something I want to grow. Biz Buzz is business-to-business support on social media, and through marketing in general. The area I live in is rural, with many business owners not quite current with the digital age, and others who are doing a great job. I'd like to bring us all together, in a concerted regional effort to support each other's marketing efforts, and to more effectively promote all of our businesses. The Independent is currently working in cooperation with three chambers of commerce and informal business coalitions on this very idea, which includes digital, print, and “shop locally” themed posters.

Since 2009 we make livestock farming. We produce artisan cheeses from our herd’s milk since 2012. Tangala Farm started in 2008 with a small vegetable garden and 2 goats. Today, Tangala is a project platform for sustainable rural living and local artisan productions.Why we recommend Tangala CheesesCheese is a fermented milk product which is the most easily digestable form of minerals, vitamins, calcium, protein and fats of milk. The seasonal changes in the forest determines the diet of our goats hence the variety of our cheeses. We value our local variety of ecological system. Our goats are fed in foresty and mountainous terrains picking the best seasonal bushes, grass, nuts of trees and flowers.Why is the campaign important for us and what we offer;Surprise! Tangala Farm Shop will be open at the Ancient Lycian City, Tlos in April 2017 . This campaign is important for us to help spread our word around and reach to more people. What we offer with this campaign;- 1 kg of cheese option (choose from the perks)- 6month membership option (choose from the perks)- Annual membership option (choose from the perks)- Christmas Package (choose from the perks)or simply ""back it"" and make your own option!Please check the gallery section to review our offers from pictures.You can use indiegogo social media tools to share this campaign with your friends,thank you!Our contact address : buket.ulukut@tangala.org  “Tangala Cheeses – We support artisan production”TangazolaTangazola, our blue cheese is named after the traditional Gorgonzola. Aged and treated minimum 3 months under special conditions. This semihard and aged blue mouldy cheese is produced all year around.Tangazola is a must-have for cheese trays, a mysterious companion to mushroom and pasta dishes and can be served on top of small bread slices as a surprisingly delicious appetizer. Tangala Fresh Cheeses (Amber/Mera/Tangatin)Tangala fresh and soft cheeses are aged minimum 4-6 weeks under special conditions. Produced all year around except during hot summer months.You can serve our fresh cheeses with vegetable dishes, salads and appetizers. Our soft cheeses are good accompanying with wine and can be served in cheese plates. They get gooey in room temperature and can be slightly heated in oven.Amber - Tangala Camambert Mera - Tangala BrieTangatin - Tangala Crottin “Tangala Aged Cheeses – We support artisan production”Tangala Heckberry CheeseOur hackberry cheese is produced only during spring and summer. Our goats eat hackberry, staphylea and sandalwood leaves in spring and fruits in summer. It is a hard natural rinded goat cheese that is aged for minimum 3 months.This cheese takes its name from hackberry shrub. What makes our hackberry cheese special is the sweet flavor of the fruits that gives its distinctive flavor to the milk.Heckberry cheese can be used in sandwiches, served with red wine or cooked with mushrooms and fresh vegitables. Is also very tasty when grated on pastas! Tangala Oak CheeseOak cheese is produced during autumn and winter. It is a hard cheese with aged bloomy rind.The special character of this cheese comes from the acorns of oak trees and bushes that our goats eat during autumn and winter. This fatty nut gives the milk a characteristic flavor and aroma.Our oak cheese can be served in cheese trays and is a very good companion for pasta dishes.  60 gün süre ile açık olacak kampanyamız üzerinden Tangala Mandıra Ürünlerine kolayca ve güvenle ulaşabilirsiniz. Peynir çeşitlerimiz ile ilgili detaylı bilgi edinebilir ve online alışveriş yapabilirsiniz.Biz Kimiz..Muğla’nın Seydikemer bölgesindeki Toros dağlarının eteğinde, Yakaköyü’nde yerleşik  olan çiftliğimiz 2008 yılında küçük bir sebze bahçesi ve 2 keçi ile başladı. 2009 yılından beri hayvancılık ve 2012 yılından bu yana peynir üretimi yapmaktayız. Bugün Tangala sürdürülebilir kırsal yaşam araştırmaları ve yerel artizan üretimler yapmaktadır.İlk çiftlik dükkanımızın açılışını Yakaköyü sınırları içerisindeki Tlos antik şehrinde 2017 Nisan ayında gerçekleştirmeyi planlıyoruz.Neden Tangala Peynirlerini Tavsiye Ediyoruz?Peynir, sütün içinde barındırdığı mineral, vitamin, kalsiyum, protein ve yağların en sindirilebilir halidir.

<h3>Maker Playhouse</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Maker Playhouse is the brain child of Mario Cuellar, parent and long time educator and recent co-founder  Ramiro Maldonado, a long term community advocate, fundraising consultant,  and civil servant.  </p>
<p>Maker Playhouse was born from a simple need, where to take our families to have clean, safe, <u><i>family</i></u> friendly fun. It has been our personal experience and research that most family fun centers leave much to be desired from. Un-kept areas, greasy food, and strong bodily odors are the norm. In most cases most “family fun centers” have very little in common for everyone in the family. This leads to many bored parents, at best and to mad and angry parents at worst.</p>
<p>When was the last time you went to a mainstream fun center to play in their ""coin"" machines and wondered, after 10-15 min,  ""What the heck am I doing here? as you tried to keep your brain from running away- that is if the smell didn't kick you in the face as soon as you walked in. </p>
<p>Fast forward in time and welcome <strong>Maker Playhouse</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As parents we all work very hard and many times that means long hours. This means that the time we get to spend with our family and children is precious and valuable.  It is important that the time we do spend with our family is meaningful and fulfilling. Thus- Maker Playhouse’s goal is to create a unique family destination where we combine the wonder of discovery with the fun of play. Our vision is to bring families together through play and play teach.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create a wholesome family experience where families can come back again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Maker Playhouse</strong> is transforming today’s family entertainment  center to feature state of the art STEM learning play areas, dynamic play equipment, obstacle adventures and maker education workshops in its own custom Maker Space.  In addition we are looking to enhance the parent experience by offering parent centric workshops geared towards learning more about STEM in general, while their children attend their own workshops.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>According to the Committee on Economic Development, the May 2016 jobs report indicated that there are currently 5.8 million job openings (CNNMONEY), which is a symptom of a growing problem in the US: employers can’t find skilled workers for jobs in a number of sectors. Much of this can be attributed to increasing disparity known as the job skills gap. This gap is a critical issue that the country faces as vacant jobs can cost companies hundreds of dollars a day in lost profits and can negatively drive America’s economic growth.</p>
<p>When we look at Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) jobs specifically, economic projections point to a need for 1 million more STEM professionals than the US will produce at the current rate over the next decade, according to the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. STEM jobs alone have grown 17 percent, which is much faster than the nearly 10 percent growth rate in all other areas. Yet the civic infrastructure is not there to support this growth.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors that limits the United States’ ability to stay ahead of the STEM curve is the lack of introduction to these educational areas at an early age. More school districts are providing laptops as resources for their students. Laptops or iPads are great in terms of exposure to technology and a step in the right direction.  However, the use of this technology is not enough to meet the future workplace skills that students need.</p>
<p>This is not the fault of teachers who hope to positively impact the lives of their students through more effective learning tools. Teachers continue to do their job, but education has not embraced the notion of teaching students about technology itself. Students use technology as consumers, but not as innovative developers through their formal education experience.  The need for this at an institutional level is increasingly important, and schools simply do not have sufficient time, flexibility, or resources to offer these types of curricula.</p>
<p>Looking at countries that are leading the way in technological innovation, we find students spend a greater amount of time in education outside of school – traditionally in a tutoring or enrichment capacity. The amount of time that a student spends weekly on their  educational enrichment activities is significantly greater around the world compared to the US. This may be associated with a cultural influence which is directly correlated to the rising importance of education needs in different industries, but can also be attributed to increased importance placed on science and technology solutions provided to students.</p>
<p>In the United States we are in the midst of a STEM revolution. STEM is at the forefront of educators and policymakers around the country. This is now also becoming increasingly important among parents as they begin to see the paradigm shift in the economy that continues to favor individuals seeking STEM jobs versus their counterparts.</p>
<p>STEM is finally being integrated in schools, but not early nor extensively enough. 38 percent of students who start college with a STEM major do not graduate with one, which is reflected by the fact that 69 percent of high school graduates are not prepared for college-level math or science, according to the National Math and Science Initiative. This is alarming and can be traced back to students not receiving the appropriate supports and interventions they need in early grades.</p>
<p>An increasing number of institutions are beginning to immerse students in STEM at younger ages. This exposure is being facilitated outside of school hours and during school vacations, which enables students to understand whether or not they are interested in further pursuing a particular STEM career. Institutions like Zaniac introduce students to skills like computer programming and 3-D printing as early as Kindergarten, and push the envelope through the eighth grade to teach more advanced subjects, such as thermodynamics, physics, orbital mechanics, and more. Such exposure helps promote students’ immersion in science and technology while building their confidence about STEM at a young age.</p>
<p>Creating a positive learning environment that empowers students in STEM is critical to preparing the next generation for the future. The current lack of infrastructure around this educational priority is disconcerting when we recognize the individual and economic benefits of addressing these issues. The necessity for STEM to be introduced at an early age has never been more important. Action needs to be taken on behalf of parents, educators, and business leaders to make sure this comes to fruition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges  </h3>
<p>It is a challenge to keep pace with the rapidly decreasing technology innovation cycles in order to provide society the tools needed for security, healthcare, energy, water, and overall environmental sustainability. It is yet another challenge to ensure that quality of life standards are improved for an ever increasing world population that would otherwise remain marginalized in their basic societal needs. This reality requires that we drive STEM education toward more inclusive platforms that integrate: (1) inter-disciplinarity; (2) global mindset; (3) environmental awareness; (4) K-12 outreach; and (4) the active use of technology in education and professional development of educators to breach the generational gap between younger students and an older generation of educators, or what Marc Prensky calls the breach between digital natives and digital immigrants.</p>
<p>According to Prensky (2001), “our students have changed radically.Today’s students are no longer the people our educational system was designed to teach”.</p>
<p>Digital natives think and process information differently, and innovation in curricula must go beyond situating a course in a distance learning platform to a paradigm shift in the creation and transfer of knowledge itself.</p>
<p>In other words, we must think about this in strategic rather than tactical terms, and will require that colleges invest heavily in e-learning projects. Those scholars dedicated to researching technology and pedagogy have been talking about this phenomenon for over a decade, yet the progress made in e-learning in STEM curricula has been modest at best.</p>
<p>The recent onset of MOOCs (massive, online, open courses), a disruptive technology, may force higher education to make more dramatic changes with respect to learning paradigm. The MOOCs phenomenon is not only advancing the notion of open access and the democratization of knowledge, it is integrating a level of creativity in the conceptualization of learning that should help drive innovation in curricular content and delivery in higher-education in the next 2-3 years.</p>
<p>To summarize, organizations dedicated to STEM education should double their efforts in bringing awareness and instilling a sense of urgency with respect to how rapidly the world is changing. Our everyday life is becoming more globalized, and mono-disciplinary approaches are no longer able to provide solutions for the complexity of society’s problems. The role of science, technology and engineering in the development of human culture should be emphasized more in K-12 education, and we must create attractors to recruit more young people, especially women, into STEM careers.</p>
<p>All of these challenges must be supported by substantial, strategic investments in how we create and deliver knowledge to a new generation of digital natives that think and process knowledge differently than a traditionally older generation of educators.</p>

<h3>Bonjour, </h3>

<div>Aimant beaucoup la communauté de Montréal-Nord et soucieuse d'offrir un enseignement de qualité je m'efforce d'offrir des cours à la population en considérant leur budget. </div>
<div>En fondant l'école Petits Pas j'avais le désir d'enseigner les arts de la scène aux enfants et adolescents dans un climat familial et amical. Notre école se veut différente car nous offrons des cours de théâtre et de danse où pour le spectacle annuel le tout est regroupé sous un même thème; la danse et le théâtre s'entremêlant au fil des scènes. J'ai à coeur d'offrir un endroit où les jeunes pourront se retrouver afin de partager des activités lucratives les menant à se dépasser et à être fier d'eux. <p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>Depuis quelques temps déjà nous regardons à améliorer la qualité de notre emplacement. Nous sommes rendu au point où il nous faut relocaliser nos locaux afin d'offrir un environnement plus sain aux élèves et professeurs. <p><br/></p>

Oasistlife Water System with 10nm is to set a platform for a giving social
enterprise which is what we are now. More than 750 </span>million<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> people in the world
living without clean drinking water. I want to let everyone to use my
technology and my platform to help them with not just immediate clean drinking
water but also the better drinking water quality that anyone would want to have
for themselves. Oasist Water System can produce 
the best drinking water quality in a portable bottle with its (world
first!) 10nm membrane.  Yes, the water
quality has passed the WHO and the higher Singapore Water Quality Standards.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p></p><div>

<p></p>
<h2><b>OUR CAUSE </b></h2>
<p>This 10nm pore size membrane ultrafiltration water bottle is created for disaster use but its well designed for daily use. This bottle is created as a clean water giving solution.  Clean virus free quality water is key for social betterment of the needy. I pre invested the bottle to this high standard (currently the old 10nm portable filtration bottle) so everyone can participate to change the lives of millions NOW!  This is because I see sufferings in people who are in dire need for clean drinking water are still suffering despite all good efforts by well meaning NGOs world wide. Many reasons for that but usually boils down to the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Well meaning clean water projects take too long to implement - suffering continues till projects implemented </li>
<li>Centralised water solutions neglected those in remote and inaccessible areas. </li>
<li>So many communities are considered ""too small"" an impact to require an effective solution despite the efforts of many small NGOs doing their best. </li>
</ol>
<p><i>Effective immediate solutions is the key! </i></p>
<p>We can bring down the costs of each litre of drinking water to very low with excellent time to the needs of the people through our Oasist Water System Solution! And we are making it FREE to the needy in this project.</p>

<p></p></div>","My name is John Teo. I am the founder and
creator of the idea behind the Oasistlife Water System. My purpose for creating
Oasistlife Water System with 10nm is to set a platform for a giving social
enterprise which is what we are now. More than 750 million people in the world
living without clean drinking water. I want to let everyone to use my
technology and my platform to help them with not just immediate clean drinking
water but also the better drinking water quality that anyone would want to have
for themselves. Oasist Water System can produce 
the best drinking water quality in a portable bottle with its (world
first!) 10nm membrane.  Yes, the water
quality has passed the WHO and the higher Singapore Water Quality Standards.


OUR CAUSE 
This 10nm pore size membrane ultrafiltration water bottle is created for disaster use but its well designed for daily use. This bottle is created as a clean water giving solution.  Clean virus free quality water is key for social betterment of the needy. I pre invested the bottle to this high standard (currently the old 10nm portable filtration bottle) so everyone can participate to change the lives of millions NOW!  This is because I see sufferings in people who are in dire need for clean drinking water are still suffering despite all good efforts by well meaning NGOs world wide. Many reasons for that but usually boils down to the following reasons:

Well meaning clean water projects take too long to implement - suffering continues till projects implemented 
Centralised water solutions neglected those in remote and inaccessible areas. 
So many communities are considered ""too small"" an impact to require an effective solution despite the efforts of many small NGOs doing their best. 

Effective immediate solutions is the key! 
We can bring down the costs of each litre of drinking water to very low with excellent time to the needs of the people through our Oasist Water System Solution! And we are making it FREE to the needy in this project.

OASISTLIFE GIVING PROJECTS













OASIST SOLUTION
Best Solution : Collect + (Pump to Drink) with 10nm (0.01 micron) Ultrafiltration membrane Technology for THE RURAL AREA
With Oasist Water System, water is collected from any fresh water source and pump to drink immediately. No more contamination and instant implementation for the benefits of the needy.  Time constraint is removed and disaster and remote and inaccessible are able to get the water using our solution.

<p><b>IT’S PERSONAL</b></p>
<p>Kevin and Paul through their professional exposure to and
involvement in the management of flood after effects witnessed the emotional,
practical and financial difficulties that victims of flooding experienced in
numerous communities and realised any form of help to those affected would be
greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Flooding does not respect social standing, personal or
business interests. It simply wipes away peoples belongings and business tools
leading to a long period of suffering and in many situations, limited recovery.</p>
<p>It was clearly evident that recovery of the most basic needs
of life such as cooking, furniture, washing etc. were taken away for extended
periods. Even if these belongings were insured, it still took months to get
replacements due to the increased demand resulting from the flooding.<br/></p>
<p>We want people to be able to return to normal as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>While assessing damage in a flood affected town in 2012 a local coffee shop
owner said:</p>
<p><i>“If only I could have opened up the day
after the floods cleared, I could have supported the emergency services with
free food and drinks. Then I could be back earning a living. As it is, I will
not be able to reopen, I am out of work now. How do I support my family?”</i></p>

<p><b>IT’s A WORLD
PROBLEM…..AND YOU CAN HELP</b></p>
<p>Everyone has seen the devastating effects of flooding to
communities on the TV, the internet and many will have firsthand knowledge or know
friends and relatives who have been affected.</p>
<p>Flooding is becoming an increasing problem and even in the last few years these events have occurred around the
world:</p>
<p>• 
2010-12 Australian Floods</p>
<p>• 
2011 Mississippi River Floods</p>
<p>• 
2012 Japan and the UK experienced flooding</p>
<p>• 
2013 Italy, Colorado and China were affected</p>
<p>• 
2014 Several Western European countries were inundated</p>
<p>• 
2014 New York and Alberta suffered</p>
<p>We have all watched media coverage as children, families and
small businesses lost everything, but we never saw what happened afterwards. The
months of struggle, living on charity, despair, frustration. Families
‘’camping’’ in their own gardens cooking on gas stoves for months on end. We have literally hundreds of examples of stories like this from flood affected families and businesses.<br/></p>
<p>How would YOU cope if your bed, furniture, fridge etc. was
missing for months on end?</p>
<p>In recent floods even those who had insurance waited months as supplies
of local replacements ran out and could not be restocked quickly. Insurance companies
dragged out agreeing on settlements, causing more suffering and incovienience while families were displaced. Today premiums for
flood insurance have skyrocketed which just causes another problem for families in flood prone areas!<br/></p>
<p>FloodPal™ is simple, effective and CAN help everyone at risk
of flooding.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>We are asking for assistance in funding the manufacture and
testing of four (4) full sized prototypes as the last stage in our development
before going to market, and require a minimum of $60,000 AU.</p>
<p>Each individually hand-made prototype will cost
approximately $6,000 (commercial manufacturing costs will be substantially
lower).</p>
<p>Testing in full-sized tanks with real furniture, white goods
etc. will cost around $20,000 excluding any improvements identified.</p>
<p>Additionally, $10,000 will be allocated to the development
of the secure protective packaging and user instructions.</p>
<p>Finally, $6,000 will be required to run consumer test
scenarios to identify any usability issues.</p>
<p><b>WHATS IN IT FOR YOU?</b></p>
<p>So what do you get by helping us?</p>
<p>You get to help 100,000’s of flood victims around the world each year.</p>
<p>Your local community will benefit.</p>

<p><b>WHAT DIFFERENCE CAN
WE MAKE</b></p>
<p><b><u>2010-12 Australian
Floods </u></b></p>
<p>Declared a Natural Disaster, and the motivation behind FloodPal, these floods forced the
evacuation of thousands of people from towns and cities. At least 70 towns and
over 200,000 people were affected.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>11,900
homes and 2,500 businesses were completely flooded</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>14,700
homes and 2,500 businesses were partially flooded</p>
<p>According to the Insurance Council of Australia, almost
56,200 claims were received by insurers, with an insured cost of $2.55 billion.
While some insurers once offered cover for riverine flood, many currently do
not, something that many policyholders discover to their cost after the
floods.</p>
<p>Flooding cannot be stopped once it has been identified as
being imminent.</p>
<p>Thus individuals, families and commercial operators face
several possibilities:</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>Remove
all belongings and stock to a safe location for the duration of the event if
possible.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>Leave
belongings and stock in place, accepting the loss (direct and consequential)
and inconvenience.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>Protect
belongings and stock from damage – sandbag property; move to a higher floor
etc.</p>
<p>The first option is seldom available, plus it relies on the
assumption that the home owner is physically able to remove their belongings
and also has a safe place to store them above flood levels. </p>
<p>The second option relies on the availability of insurance
cover, which is becoming increasingly difficult to secure at an affordable
rate. If and when insurance accepts a claim, supply of replacement goods within a reasonable timescale is generally an issue.<br/></p>
<p>Finally, trying to prevent flood waters entering the
property or moving items to a higher level (if available) is not very
successful on a small, localised scale. (June 2013 – Hungary had limited success with floodwalls on a large scale in central city areas only).</p>
<p><b>THE FLOODPAL™
SOLUTION</b></p>
<p>The basic idea of FloodPal™ was developed to provide
protection to personal belongings, white goods and commercial equipment during
times of flood. This will assist in limiting the immediate living and financial impact to
families/businesses by avoiding the need for replacement of damaged goods.
This will also assist in families and businesses quickly returning to normal following a flood
event.</p>
<p>The simplest idea was to provide a strong waterproof bag
that could be utilised to store goods, but this idea proved difficult to use
and was subject to movement due to the force of water currents which places the
goods inside at risk of damage. Examples of these basic products already exist but are considered
unsatisfactory in comparison with FloodPal™.</p>
<p>After several iterations of design,we now have a system that creates a '<i>waterproof room</i>' within an existing building, requiring no additional anchoring  and that is simple to set up on your own.</p>
<p>This self-supporting, self-anchoring, pressure regulating waterproof
enclosure for residential, commercial and industrial use provides a temporary
secure and waterproof area to store goods.</p>
<p>Individuals and businesses that will benefit are:</p>
<p>• 
Previously flooded properties.</p>
<p>• 
Properties in ‘at risk’ areas as identified by either local authorities or insurance companies</p>
<p>• 
Commercial premises in flood prone areas.</p>
<p>• 
Government agencies with offices or
Infrastructure in flood prone areas.</p>
<p>• 
Insurance providers – wishing to mitigate risk
exposure and poor public perception.</p><p>• 
Mining companies with expensive equipment at risk from flooding.</p><p>• 
Armed services who need to transport equipment over water.<br/></p>
<p>FloodPal will help people worldwide, but initially our focus is
within Australia with the intention to expanding to the USA and Europe ASAP. Indeed, we may
find partners through Indiegogo who could accelerate this global expansion……</p>
<p><b>WHY SHOULD YOU
SUPPORT US?</b></p>
<p>This is a completely reasonable question, why donate your
hard earned money to such a simple idea?</p>
<p>We want to help people and with your help we can make a
difference. You may already live in an area at risk of flooding, or know
someone who is.</p>
<p>Remember, we are <b>NOT</b>
driven entirely by profit, but the desire to <b>HELP</b>
people.</p>
<p>We know that weather patterns are changing and floods are
becoming more frequent and destructive. Eventually, sea level rise could lead
to coastal and river flooding.</p>
<p>Floods cannot be prevented, but the impact on people can be
reduced. We can help people and business return to a more normal life quicker,
with less loss and stress.</p>
<p>We cannot protect entire buildings, but historical data shows that in most flood situations, damage to buildings is low/moderate and can be economically repaired. However, belongings and electrical goods are needed immediately after a
flood. Electricity is normally reconnected very quickly (the FloodPal™ can
protect a generator if required), people can live in and work in buildings waiting
for superficial repairs if they have the basics of life.</p><p><b>FloodPal is designed for this scenario</b></p>
<p>Think of a few ways FloodPal™ could protect you:</p>
<p>• 
A school library could protect its books etc.</p>
<p>• 
Small business can protect equipment and stock.</p>
<p>• 
A medical centre can protect equipment and
records.</p>
<p>• 
A householder can save their furniture etc.</p>
<p>•  Protecting disaster relief supplies etc.</p>
<p>The list of uses is almost endless.</p>

Flooding does not respect social standing, personal or
business interests. It simply wipes away peoples belongings and business tools
leading to a long period of suffering and in many situations, limited recovery.
It was clearly evident that recovery of the most basic needs
of life such as cooking, furniture, washing etc. were taken away for extended
periods. Even if these belongings were insured, it still took months to get
replacements due to the increased demand resulting from the flooding.
We want people to be able to return to normal as soon as
possible.
While assessing damage in a flood affected town in 2012 a local coffee shop
owner said:
“If only I could have opened up the day
after the floods cleared, I could have supported the emergency services with
free food and drinks. Then I could be back earning a living. As it is, I will
not be able to reopen, I am out of work now. How do I support my family?”
WE CAN HELP PEOPLE
EVERYWHERE. Even if you can’t contribute, please spread our campaign as far
and wide as possible, friends, local papers, TV, councillors, MP’s, Senators
etc. be DIRECT, be PERSONAL. Please remember that FloodPal is a product that was designed to help people in circumstances that have proved to be disastrous in the past. If you want to help but can’t afford to on your own, why not
club together with your friends and support us jointly, $1 each goes a long way.
IT’s A WORLD
PROBLEM…..AND YOU CAN HELP
Everyone has seen the devastating effects of flooding to
communities on the TV, the internet and many will have firsthand knowledge or know
friends and relatives who have been affected.
Flooding is becoming an increasing problem and even in the last few years these events have occurred around the
world:
• 
2010-12 Australian Floods
• 
2011 Mississippi River Floods
• 
2012 Japan and the UK experienced flooding
• 
2013 Italy, Colorado and China were affected
• 
2014 Several Western European countries were inundated
• 
2014 New York and Alberta suffered
We have all watched media coverage as children, families and
small businesses lost everything, but we never saw what happened afterwards. The
months of struggle, living on charity, despair, frustration. Families
‘’camping’’ in their own gardens cooking on gas stoves for months on end. We have literally hundreds of examples of stories like this from flood affected families and businesses.
How would YOU cope if your bed, furniture, fridge etc. was
missing for months on end?
In recent floods even those who had insurance waited months as supplies
of local replacements ran out and could not be restocked quickly. Insurance companies
dragged out agreeing on settlements, causing more suffering and incovienience while families were displaced. Today premiums for
flood insurance have skyrocketed which just causes another problem for families in flood prone areas!
FloodPal™ is simple, effective and CAN help everyone at risk
of flooding.
WHAT WE NEED
We are asking for assistance in funding the manufacture and
testing of four (4) full sized prototypes as the last stage in our development
before going to market, and require a minimum of $60,000 AU.
Each individually hand-made prototype will cost
approximately $6,000 (commercial manufacturing costs will be substantially
lower).
Testing in full-sized tanks with real furniture, white goods
etc. will cost around $20,000 excluding any improvements identified.
Additionally, $10,000 will be allocated to the development
of the secure protective packaging and user instructions.
Finally, $6,000 will be required to run consumer test
scenarios to identify any usability issues.
WHATS IN IT FOR YOU?
So what do you get by helping us?
You get to help 100,000’s of flood victims around the world each year.
Your local community will benefit.
But let’s be more personal….. depending on your level of
donation, we offer the following in return:

WHAT DIFFERENCE CAN
WE MAKE
2010-12 Australian
Floods 
Declared a Natural Disaster, and the motivation behind FloodPal, these floods forced the
evacuation of thousands of people from towns and cities. At least 70 towns and
over 200,000 people were affected.
•  11,900
homes and 2,500 businesses were completely flooded
•  14,700
homes and 2,500 businesses were partially flooded
According to the Insurance Council of Australia, almost
56,200 claims were received by insurers, with an insured cost of $2.55 billion.
While some insurers once offered cover for riverine flood, many currently do
not, something that many policyholders discover to their cost after the
floods.
Flooding cannot be stopped once it has been identified as
being imminent.
Thus individuals, families and commercial operators face
several possibilities:
•  Remove
all belongings and stock to a safe location for the duration of the event if
possible.
•  Leave
belongings and stock in place, accepting the loss (direct and consequential)
and inconvenience.
•  Protect
belongings and stock from damage – sandbag property; move to a higher floor
etc.
The first option is seldom available, plus it relies on the
assumption that the home owner is physically able to remove their belongings
and also has a safe place to store them above flood levels. 
The second option relies on the availability of insurance
cover, which is becoming increasingly difficult to secure at an affordable
rate. If and when insurance accepts a claim, supply of replacement goods within a reasonable timescale is generally an issue.
Finally, trying to prevent flood waters entering the
property or moving items to a higher level (if available) is not very
successful on a small, localised scale. (June 2013 – Hungary had limited success with floodwalls on a large scale in central city areas only).
THE FLOODPAL™
SOLUTION
The basic idea of FloodPal™ was developed to provide
protection to personal belongings, white goods and commercial equipment during
times of flood. This will assist in limiting the immediate living and financial impact to
families/businesses by avoiding the need for replacement of damaged goods.
This will also assist in families and businesses quickly returning to normal following a flood
event.
The simplest idea was to provide a strong waterproof bag
that could be utilised to store goods, but this idea proved difficult to use
and was subject to movement due to the force of water currents which places the
goods inside at risk of damage. Examples of these basic products already exist but are considered
unsatisfactory in comparison with FloodPal™.
After several iterations of design,we now have a system that creates a 'waterproof room' within an existing building, requiring no additional anchoring  and that is simple to set up on your own.
This self-supporting, self-anchoring, pressure regulating waterproof
enclosure for residential, commercial and industrial use provides a temporary
secure and waterproof area to store goods.
Individuals and businesses that will benefit are:
• 
Previously flooded properties.
• 
Properties in ‘at risk’ areas as identified by either local authorities or insurance companies
• 
Commercial premises in flood prone areas.
• 
Government agencies with offices or
Infrastructure in flood prone areas.
• 
Insurance providers – wishing to mitigate risk
exposure and poor public perception.• 
Mining companies with expensive equipment at risk from flooding.• 
Armed services who need to transport equipment over water.
FloodPal will help people worldwide, but initially our focus is
within Australia with the intention to expanding to the USA and Europe ASAP. Indeed, we may
find partners through Indiegogo who could accelerate this global expansion……
WHY SHOULD YOU
SUPPORT US?
This is a completely reasonable question, why donate your
hard earned money to such a simple idea?
We want to help people and with your help we can make a
difference. You may already live in an area at risk of flooding, or know
someone who is.
Remember, we are NOT
driven entirely by profit, but the desire to HELP
people.
We know that weather patterns are changing and floods are
becoming more frequent and destructive. Eventually, sea level rise could lead
to coastal and river flooding.
Floods cannot be prevented, but the impact on people can be
reduced. We can help people and business return to a more normal life quicker,
with less loss and stress.
We cannot protect entire buildings, but historical data shows that in most flood situations, damage to buildings is low/moderate and can be economically repaired. However, belongings and electrical goods are needed immediately after a
flood. Electricity is normally reconnected very quickly (the FloodPal™ can
protect a generator if required), people can live in and work in buildings waiting
for superficial repairs if they have the basics of life.FloodPal is designed for this scenario
Think of a few ways FloodPal™ could protect you:
• 
A school library could protect its books etc.
• 
Small business can protect equipment and stock.
• 
A medical centre can protect equipment and
records.
• 
A householder can save their furniture etc.
•  Protecting disaster relief supplies etc.
The list of uses is almost endless.

<div>Hey everyone! My name is Gina Graveline and I'm 28 years old, originally from Bangor Maine, but I've been living in NYC for over ten years. I've been working in the service industry for seven years now and hospitality and food are my passions in life. I love cooking and love even more to share my food with others. I graduated with a bachelors in business administration, concentration in small business and entreprenuership, in order to pursue my dream of owning my own food truck.  I have launched this campaign in order to raise more funds needed to get my food truck started. <span>My menu is small but packs a serious punch when it comes to flavor and originality. </span><span>I want to bring a Maine flare using fresh lobster to the street fare food of New York, such as lobster sliders and lobster tacos. I am very confident in my endeavor and can guarantee that people will enjoy everything that my truck has to offer. I have been working very hard over the past few years and have been saving as much money as possible, but I have not been able to produce the necessary funds needed to get started. That's where you come in! </span>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I am looking to raise $80,000 dollars which will cover the cost of the food truck as well as all of my beginning inventory and marketing costs. As we all know lobster is not a cheap commodity and the price of it fluctuates depending on the season so I have estimated the dollar amount needed in order to get through my first few months. I am looking to purchase a new truck which can range anywhere from $50,000 to $150,000 dollars. The particular truck I am interested in is roughly $68,000. I will also need to make some modifications both appliance wise and aesthetically wise which will be a least another $5,000 dollars. The estimated costs for beginning inventory is $3,000 dollars which will be enough to support the business for a few months. Marketing costs are estimated at $2,500 dollars which includes the cost for website development. </div>
<div>
<span>In order to show my appreciation for the help I recieve there will be a customer loyalty program in which, depending on how much money is donated, will provide many perks such as free food from the truck or even the opportunity to have an item on the menu temporarily named after you! The perks available are listed on the right hand side of the campaign. Even if my goal is not reached all of the funds raised will go towards the purchase of the truck which is the most important aspect of my campaign. </span>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Your Impact</h3>
<div>Not only will this food truck fulfill my dreams but I hope that in the future I will be able to expand, resulting in new jobs for my fellow New Yorkers. The food truck industry is no walk in the park and takes a lot of hard work and dedication, however I would love to share this experience with other people who have the same passions as myself. I also know for a fact that food is an amazing way to allow people to connect. My goal is to bring people together through my food concept while also allowing everyone to get a genuine expeirience of the food that I grew up loving so much. If you are a true foodie such as myself then you understand how important food can be for people. Putting a smile on someone's face because they enjoy my food is something that is defintley priceless.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Low on Cash....Don't Worry! </h3>
<div>Even if you can't donate any money, word of mouth can be more powerful than anything and it would be greatly apppreciated if everyone could spread the word about my campaign and my food truck in general. Please share my campaign with anyone you know that has an appretiation for food and who would be interested in being a part of my journey. If you can post my campaign page link through all the social media outlets that you use it would be an enormous aid. The Indiegogo share tools are super easy and make it possible for everyone to share my campaign with the world. <span>Everyone involved in this project should know that they are involved in something that is very special in my heart and my appreciation for your help is beyond what words can express.

</div><p><b>Short Summary.</b></p>Today, many Chicago
neighborhoods are overrun with violent crime.  As a real estate investment expert and a
psychologist, I recognize the effects the physical environment is having on the
psychology of generations of kids growing up amid violence and abandoned
buildings.  Research shows us the
vicious cycle of despair initiated by scarcity. 
Scarcity of financial resources, scarcity of opportunity to get ahead or
get out, scarcity of feelings of safety, and the scarcity of connection to a
strong family or community all perpetuate hopelessness.

<p>I need your help to break
this cycle of despair.</p>
<p>Research confirms what you might guess about the beneficial outcomes from promoting a positive
identity and community and instilling a sense of belonging and safety to
youths.  This can be done by bringing
opportunity to my Chicago neighbors most in need.  </p>
<p>Using my real estate
network, I identified a 5-acre parcel of private land we will use to establish a first of its kind Urban Farming
Institute (UFI).  With your help, we will transform the community through opportunity.</p>
<p>I am counseled by farming experts at the University of Illinois who are helping to develop farming operations to
meet the unique challenges of an urban environment and a small site.  Together we'll also design coursework that promotes urban farming as a career
path for students and the residents of the neighborhoods that will host farm
sites.  UFI will be part classroom and
part business venture.</p>
<p>Neighbors will staff
the farm.  Opportunities exist for both
volunteer and paid positions in operations, sales, administrative and community
outreach.  I also propose a
profit-sharing within the community as a means of building a cooperative
relationship based on mutual benefits as opposed to handouts.</p>
<p><b>Contributions to UFI
will be used to:</b></p>
<p></p><ol>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Reduce violent crime</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Bring financial and
educational opportunities to neighborhoods that have been ignored or forgotten,</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Increase the type and
amount of locally-grown organic produce available for retail purchase and restaurants

</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Find new ways to
promote a sustainable urban existence.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol><p><b>Community Engagement</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>For UFI, community is key. 
Born out of both formal and informal meetings, the idea of an urban farm
in Chicago’s greater Engelwood community is something that neighbors
embrace.  In response to our recent
survey* of 400 residents of greater Englewood:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>68%</b> <b>support</b> an urban farm in their neighborhood.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>76%</b> believe an urban farm would have a <b>positive impact</b>
on children and residents.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>61%</b> said that they would consider <b>working</b> at a
local an urban farm.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>65%</b> said that they are likely to participate in<b>
free classes</b> or are interested in <b>starting a food based business</b> with the help
of an urban farm.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Cleaning up</b> vacant land ranked as the <b>second-highest</b>
priority of Neighborhood Needs.</p>
<p>UFI has a dedicated team of volunteers committed to
community outreach.  Both formal and
informal networks provide us the means to have a conversation and accept community
input into our planning and operations.  What we found was that there is pent up energy for explosive positive change in many communities.  We believe UFI can be the catalyst for those improvement efforts.<br/></p><p>We opened a toll-free community hotline (888-977-2251) that allows
neighbors to leave us feedback and their ideas.  Our website (<a href=""http://www.urbanfarmchicago"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.urbanfarmchicago</a>) has a chat board and community forum space for
all of us to hear and discuss good ideas. 
While we can’t be all things to all people, we want the community to
help us build an organization that will do the most good for our neighbors.</p>
<b>
</b><p><i>* Survey
conducted by Compass Consulting, LLC, November 12, 2014.<span>  Thanks for the donation!</span></i></p><p><i><span><br/></span></i></p>
<p><b>Crowd-funding.  This is where your money goes...</b></p>
<p>UFI needs seed funds
of $181,818.  That is what our budget calls for down to the last dollar.  This money will be used for
site selection and rehabilitation, construction of a greenhouse and classroom,
farming tools both manual and automated, administrative things like printers
and phones, security features, seeds and plants, operational staff and
educators, water bills, permits and legal fees, and marketing materials.</p>
<p>And, we want you to be
a part of the ribbon cutting when we are ready to open in Spring of 2015!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our
goal, then the money will be used to do as much as we can to reach our
objectives.  Smaller site, no greenhouse,
etc..</p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p><p><b>Crowd-solving.  This is where your ideas come in...</b></p><p>We obviously believe in the power of the group.  We are smart enough that we don't know everything, and that's where you come in.  UFI will be unlike any other urban farming project because we want to be the innovation proving grounds for all other urban farming.  If you have good ideas, new technology, an invention you want to test, bring it over.  Once we are set up, we hope to be able to fund research and provide open-source solutions to the urban farming community.</p><b>The Impact.</b><p>Even the short-term benefits
have long term effects.  UFI jobs and
educational opportunities provide an immediate benefit to those who join with
us as employees and students.  Risk-behavior
research I conducted suggests that a paycheck for a day’s work is the best
motivator to avoid destructive behaviors. 
Developmental psychology tells us that learning new skills builds
confidence in one’s abilities.  The
opportunities UFI brings to neighborhoods that have not seen much love lately
will re-ignite the flame of self-reliance that was dampened by crime, abandoned
buildings and hopelessness.  With your
help, we can break the cycle of despair that grips many in Chicago’s toughest
communities.</p>
<p>The immediate short
term environmental impact is great as well. 
We will turn abandoned property and land, which harbors crime, and poses
significant health risks, into a living breathing sustainable organic farm,
capable of feeding hundreds of Chicago families and restaurants.  Gone will be the artifacts of neglect,
replaced with literal green shoots of progress and promise for the future of
the community.</p>
<p>Long term,
transforming communities means transforming the culture as well.  UFI is a first-step in transforming
community identity from one of despair to one of prosperity.  Nothing builds success like success because
insiders see the change and begin to identify themselves as part of it.  Outsiders in turn want to be part of it and
are motivated to change as well.</p>
<p>With the backing of
the world-class agricultural program at U of I, we also aim to change the way
Americans see the “farm”.  To most
city-dwellers, farms are far off places where cows and chickens roam and where
trucks pick up food to deliver it to chain grocers.  We want to change that by inventing a way for
small farmettes to be sustainable both environmentally and economically.  There is no reason why future community
planning should not include open space for urban farming, just like it includes
retail and residential space.  Together
we will transform city living 3.5 acres at a time.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b>A Commitment to Organic Farming, Renewables, and Doing Things Right.</b></p><p>As a prototype urban farm, we are committed to getting it right.  Our partners at the U of I are as committed to finding answers to sustainability within the urban setting. Science and technology will be our guides.  We know climate change is happening; we know carbon emissions are a major cause; we know pesticides are harmful; we know people need to eat better; we know that to be successful we need to demonstrate that doing the right thing can be profitable.  That's why we will be testing and inventing the future best practices for urban farming.  We don't want to just do it, we want to do it Better.</p><b></b><p><b>A Commitment to the 10X Principle.</b></p><p>We are committed to providing employment opportunities at fair wages.  Our understanding of ""fair"" means that no one in the organization will ever make more than ten times anyone else.  When the tide rises, it carries all ships, and so will this enterprise.  If there are ever executives at U-Fin, they won't ever make more than ten times what the new guy makes.  We believe in balance, dignity, and respect for all those who contribute to the team.  If one person deserves a raise, then the team deserves a raise.  We understand this seems rEvoultionary and it's not for everyone; but it is for everyone at U-Fin.</p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges.</b><p>Earning the support of
the City of Chicago and U of I gives us quite a leg-up on the project, but
challenges still exist.     </p>
<p>Knowing what we know
about psychology, business, real estate and farming, we believe the plan is
well-founded and leaves room for the necessary tweaks to overcome any obstacles
and achieve our objectives.</p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help.</b></p>
<p>Volunteers and non-cash donations are
welcome!  We can use elbow grease and leg

<p></p></div>","Short Summary.Today, many Chicago
neighborhoods are overrun with violent crime.  As a real estate investment expert and a
psychologist, I recognize the effects the physical environment is having on the
psychology of generations of kids growing up amid violence and abandoned
buildings.  Research shows us the
vicious cycle of despair initiated by scarcity. 
Scarcity of financial resources, scarcity of opportunity to get ahead or
get out, scarcity of feelings of safety, and the scarcity of connection to a
strong family or community all perpetuate hopelessness.

I need your help to break
this cycle of despair.
Research confirms what you might guess about the beneficial outcomes from promoting a positive
identity and community and instilling a sense of belonging and safety to
youths.  This can be done by bringing
opportunity to my Chicago neighbors most in need.  
Using my real estate
network, I identified a 5-acre parcel of private land we will use to establish a first of its kind Urban Farming
Institute (UFI).  With your help, we will transform the community through opportunity.
I am counseled by farming experts at the University of Illinois who are helping to develop farming operations to
meet the unique challenges of an urban environment and a small site.  Together we'll also design coursework that promotes urban farming as a career
path for students and the residents of the neighborhoods that will host farm
sites.  UFI will be part classroom and
part business venture.
Neighbors will staff
the farm.  Opportunities exist for both
volunteer and paid positions in operations, sales, administrative and community
outreach.  I also propose a
profit-sharing within the community as a means of building a cooperative
relationship based on mutual benefits as opposed to handouts.
Contributions to UFI
will be used to:

Reduce violent crime
Bring financial and
educational opportunities to neighborhoods that have been ignored or forgotten,

Increase the type and
amount of locally-grown organic produce available for retail purchase and restaurants
in Chicago,


Find new ways to
promote a sustainable urban existence.

Community Engagement
For UFI, community is key. 
Born out of both formal and informal meetings, the idea of an urban farm
in Chicago’s greater Engelwood community is something that neighbors
embrace.  In response to our recent
survey* of 400 residents of greater Englewood:
· 
68% support an urban farm in their neighborhood.
· 
76% believe an urban farm would have a positive impact
on children and residents.
· 
61% said that they would consider working at a
local an urban farm.
· 
65% said that they are likely to participate in
free classes or are interested in starting a food based business with the help
of an urban farm.
· 
Cleaning up vacant land ranked as the second-highest
priority of Neighborhood Needs.
UFI has a dedicated team of volunteers committed to
community outreach.  Both formal and
informal networks provide us the means to have a conversation and accept community
input into our planning and operations.  What we found was that there is pent up energy for explosive positive change in many communities.  We believe UFI can be the catalyst for those improvement efforts.We opened a toll-free community hotline (888-977-2251) that allows
neighbors to leave us feedback and their ideas.  Our website (www.urbanfarmchicago) has a chat board and community forum space for
all of us to hear and discuss good ideas. 
While we can’t be all things to all people, we want the community to
help us build an organization that will do the most good for our neighbors.

* Survey
conducted by Compass Consulting, LLC, November 12, 2014.  Thanks for the donation!
Crowd-funding.  This is where your money goes...
UFI needs seed funds
of $181,818.  That is what our budget calls for down to the last dollar.  This money will be used for
site selection and rehabilitation, construction of a greenhouse and classroom,
farming tools both manual and automated, administrative things like printers
and phones, security features, seeds and plants, operational staff and
educators, water bills, permits and legal fees, and marketing materials.
And, we want you to be
a part of the ribbon cutting when we are ready to open in Spring of 2015!
If we do not reach our
goal, then the money will be used to do as much as we can to reach our
objectives.  Smaller site, no greenhouse,
etc..
Crowd-solving.  This is where your ideas come in...We obviously believe in the power of the group.  We are smart enough that we don't know everything, and that's where you come in.  UFI will be unlike any other urban farming project because we want to be the innovation proving grounds for all other urban farming.  If you have good ideas, new technology, an invention you want to test, bring it over.  Once we are set up, we hope to be able to fund research and provide open-source solutions to the urban farming community.The Impact.Even the short-term benefits
have long term effects.  UFI jobs and
educational opportunities provide an immediate benefit to those who join with
us as employees and students.  Risk-behavior
research I conducted suggests that a paycheck for a day’s work is the best
motivator to avoid destructive behaviors. 
Developmental psychology tells us that learning new skills builds
confidence in one’s abilities.  The
opportunities UFI brings to neighborhoods that have not seen much love lately
will re-ignite the flame of self-reliance that was dampened by crime, abandoned
buildings and hopelessness.  With your
help, we can break the cycle of despair that grips many in Chicago’s toughest
communities.
The immediate short
term environmental impact is great as well. 
We will turn abandoned property and land, which harbors crime, and poses
significant health risks, into a living breathing sustainable organic farm,
capable of feeding hundreds of Chicago families and restaurants.  Gone will be the artifacts of neglect,
replaced with literal green shoots of progress and promise for the future of
the community.
Long term,
transforming communities means transforming the culture as well.  UFI is a first-step in transforming
community identity from one of despair to one of prosperity.  Nothing builds success like success because
insiders see the change and begin to identify themselves as part of it.  Outsiders in turn want to be part of it and
are motivated to change as well.
With the backing of
the world-class agricultural program at U of I, we also aim to change the way
Americans see the “farm”.  To most
city-dwellers, farms are far off places where cows and chickens roam and where
trucks pick up food to deliver it to chain grocers.  We want to change that by inventing a way for
small farmettes to be sustainable both environmentally and economically.  There is no reason why future community
planning should not include open space for urban farming, just like it includes
retail and residential space.  Together
we will transform city living 3.5 acres at a time.
A Commitment to Organic Farming, Renewables, and Doing Things Right.As a prototype urban farm, we are committed to getting it right.  Our partners at the U of I are as committed to finding answers to sustainability within the urban setting. Science and technology will be our guides.  We know climate change is happening; we know carbon emissions are a major cause; we know pesticides are harmful; we know people need to eat better; we know that to be successful we need to demonstrate that doing the right thing can be profitable.  That's why we will be testing and inventing the future best practices for urban farming.  We don't want to just do it, we want to do it Better.A Commitment to the 10X Principle.We are committed to providing employment opportunities at fair wages.  Our understanding of ""fair"" means that no one in the organization will ever make more than ten times anyone else.  When the tide rises, it carries all ships, and so will this enterprise.  If there are ever executives at U-Fin, they won't ever make more than ten times what the new guy makes.  We believe in balance, dignity, and respect for all those who contribute to the team.  If one person deserves a raise, then the team deserves a raise.  We understand this seems rEvoultionary and it's not for everyone; but it is for everyone at U-Fin.Risks & Challenges.Earning the support of
the City of Chicago and U of I gives us quite a leg-up on the project, but
challenges still exist.     
Knowing what we know
about psychology, business, real estate and farming, we believe the plan is
well-founded and leaves room for the necessary tweaks to overcome any obstacles
and achieve our objectives.Other Ways You Can Help.

<p>Perks for <b>you</b>: SWAG!<span><br/></span>How this works is, you will visit the website that I published displaying all the different brilliant pieces of art that has been donated to sell. </p>
<p>One of the things I did in designing this campaign was call my ex-boyfriend. Yes, I called my ex and asked him if he'd be interested in contributing by donating his mom's jewelry. This is to say, it not only took forgiving the two guys and their crew, but also reconciling with my ex and what we went through together in dealing with this. He was there with me that night and it was very bitter sweet as I was going through slight amnesia and asked him to tell me what we did that day (I didn't remember anything including why we needed to go to the hospital; I actually have no recollection of this story- this is what he told me had happened.) He then asked if I knew who he was, which happened to be the only thing I was certain of, and responded yeah, you're kevin and I love you. Then a couple years later we broke up, and here we are now. So treat yo'self to something sweet from the Shanny Shop! [When selecting swag from the Shanny Shop please include the <b>item#</b>]</p>
<p>Other options include bling for your walls. I have arranged a striking collection of paintings by two great artists with very different styles, one of whom is my father!</p>
<p>These paintings are breathtaking. Take a look on the website and in your swag selection include the number [<b>painting #</b>]</p>

</div><div>
<p>Here's the scoop: Aside from the physical repair of my jaw, the intention of this campaign is to inspire a resolution of conflicts at different levels in any part of the world. The opportunity this has been for me is to forgive all the violence in my life, especially the stuff that has happened in my own family. This also includes forgiving: Governmental oppression, police brutality, those with opposing opinions and expectations regarding social justice, youths shooting other youths, the church for allowing their leaders to not practice what they preach, the use of war, exploitation, and colonialism. </p>
<p>I'm talking about forgiveness as a choice- in any moment, for absolutely no reason, and after any consideration. It's absolutely not saying I condone the behavior, or I accept/tolerate/or am willing to put up with it. I'm not, and I'm also not willing to allow myself to remain resentful. That ain't for me. My first and second name mean 'Peace Everlasting' and that's what I'm for. Whatever it takes.</p>
<p>When I first got out of the hospital and continued with my plans to move to Arizona for a graduate program in community counseling, I organized a fundraiser with participation from my friends, co-workers and family and it absolutely ruled. Then earlier this summer my friends put together another collection that got me a reservation for my final consultations and impressions (not the funny kind done by comedians) to start the final stages of completing this work. Now THIS is all that's left!!! My dentist and surgeon are set: wax teeth models are made, bone is ready, aim, fire away...</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Part of the importance of completing the work as soon as possible is to maintain the bone &amp; tissue graft that were already placed, to keep the teeth in their current position, and to shape the gums back to a natural convex curve. This will be done with temporary teeth, and although there is risk of the temps cracking I am very well practiced in declining a chicago style hot dog, or passing on corn on the cob (elotes), or even biting into an apple (my biggest weakness). I have SO many recipes to liquify all my meals!</p>
<p>Another challenge is knowing that violence isn't going to go away in its totality. My commitment is to remain firm about creating a possibility of peace, and not merely altering the circumstance and existence of violence, which ultimately will not make the difference. I have an awesome team supporting me and engaging in this creation with me!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>One major way to support this campaign without contributing money is to share the website with your community and especially anyone interested in art. Have your business buy art, have your grandma buy art, have you neighbor buy art, have your boss lady buy art, have your bar or tavern buy art, have your dentist office buy art. </div>
<div>Another way to support me is with professional/legal coaching as I appeal the State Attorney General's decision on my Crime Victim's Compensation application. </div> <p><br/></p>

could almost always count on a response wishing more violent acts to be done to
the guys. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO BE SPENDING MY TIME TALKING ABOUT. I want
to create, not react with violence in retribution to violence.
This is
a campaign for reviving life.
   What I Need & What You Get 

For three years I have been pre-occupied with juggling my recovery & finances, while amazing opportunities keep knocking on my door. I am ready to move forward & let it rip! 
This campaign is for $3,000. I have $7,008 dollars to pay off before I can move on to the
final stretch of completing my smile! This is 2k down from “Let
Me Z Your Grill” campaign in June!!! (Gracias, Merci, Danka, Speciba, Grazie, THANK
YOU).
Broken down (pun intended): 






Anesthesia


$1220




Extraction


$325




Bone Graft


$1775




IV’s


$238




Implant


$2200




Tissue Graft


$750




Oral Surgical Splint


$500




Remaining work includes: 
an Abutment; temp teeth to shape my gums; and 2 crowns (because I'm super fly).
Perks for you: SWAG!How this works is, you will visit the website that I published displaying all the different brilliant pieces of art that has been donated to sell. 
One of the things I did in designing this campaign was call my ex-boyfriend. Yes, I called my ex and asked him if he'd be interested in contributing by donating his mom's jewelry. This is to say, it not only took forgiving the two guys and their crew, but also reconciling with my ex and what we went through together in dealing with this. He was there with me that night and it was very bitter sweet as I was going through slight amnesia and asked him to tell me what we did that day (I didn't remember anything including why we needed to go to the hospital; I actually have no recollection of this story- this is what he told me had happened.) He then asked if I knew who he was, which happened to be the only thing I was certain of, and responded yeah, you're kevin and I love you. Then a couple years later we broke up, and here we are now. So treat yo'self to something sweet from the Shanny Shop! [When selecting swag from the Shanny Shop please include the item#]
Other options include bling for your walls. I have arranged a striking collection of paintings by two great artists with very different styles, one of whom is my father!
These paintings are breathtaking. Take a look on the website and in your swag selection include the number [painting #]

The Impact

Here's the scoop: Aside from the physical repair of my jaw, the intention of this campaign is to inspire a resolution of conflicts at different levels in any part of the world. The opportunity this has been for me is to forgive all the violence in my life, especially the stuff that has happened in my own family. This also includes forgiving: Governmental oppression, police brutality, those with opposing opinions and expectations regarding social justice, youths shooting other youths, the church for allowing their leaders to not practice what they preach, the use of war, exploitation, and colonialism. 
I'm talking about forgiveness as a choice- in any moment, for absolutely no reason, and after any consideration. It's absolutely not saying I condone the behavior, or I accept/tolerate/or am willing to put up with it. I'm not, and I'm also not willing to allow myself to remain resentful. That ain't for me. My first and second name mean 'Peace Everlasting' and that's what I'm for. Whatever it takes.
When I first got out of the hospital and continued with my plans to move to Arizona for a graduate program in community counseling, I organized a fundraiser with participation from my friends, co-workers and family and it absolutely ruled. Then earlier this summer my friends put together another collection that got me a reservation for my final consultations and impressions (not the funny kind done by comedians) to start the final stages of completing this work. Now THIS is all that's left!!! My dentist and surgeon are set: wax teeth models are made, bone is ready, aim, fire away...
    Risks & Challenges Part of the importance of completing the work as soon as possible is to maintain the bone & tissue graft that were already placed, to keep the teeth in their current position, and to shape the gums back to a natural convex curve. This will be done with temporary teeth, and although there is risk of the temps cracking I am very well practiced in declining a chicago style hot dog, or passing on corn on the cob (elotes), or even biting into an apple (my biggest weakness). I have SO many recipes to liquify all my meals!
Another challenge is knowing that violence isn't going to go away in its totality. My commitment is to remain firm about creating a possibility of peace, and not merely altering the circumstance and existence of violence, which ultimately will not make the difference. I have an awesome team supporting me and engaging in this creation with me!
    Other Ways You Can Help
One major way to support this campaign without contributing money is to share the website with your community and especially anyone interested in art. Have your business buy art, have your grandma buy art, have you neighbor buy art, have your boss lady buy art, have your bar or tavern buy art, have your dentist office buy art. 
Another way to support me is with professional/legal coaching as I appeal the State Attorney General's decision on my Crime Victim's Compensation application.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Why You should fund US!</h3>
<p>Because we are standing together to fight against all forms of oppression and bigotry - from racism, homophobia, and sexism, to attacks on the working class. We also stand in solidarity with struggles against oppression internationally (such as the movement for a free Palestine). Oppression is a collective social issue. Recognizing the connections between racial and ethnic identities, gender, sexuality, and social economic status can help us understand how we identify with and combat oppression.</p>
<p>Our Coalition has already been thriving during its short existence having been featured in The Exponent and Fox 59. We have also contributed to our community through several projects we have already successfully pulled off, including open mics, bringing 'Out of Shadows' speakers to campus, confronting police brutality at local forums, and our general engagement in a variety of events highlighted on our social media platform. Though our most significant contribution has been our ability, as a coalition, to work with already established student and community organizations and to bring them together in addressing social justice issues. </p>
<p>We have designed our coalition to be the glue that binds individuals from all walks of life and organizations into a bond strong enough to put our Words Into Action and bring change to our communities. </p>
<p>We have worked hard to sustain our efforts by working creatively with those organizations. However, we now ask you to help us to maximize our efforts. </p>

<p>Since 2010,
major investments of more than $20,000 have been made in vine growing, testing,
winemaking and research on the North Shore terroir. <i>Innovation and Development Manicouagan </i>has supported our project in
2012 and 2013. In 2014, Ms. Gaelle Dubé provided technical supports regarding
the research work and establishment of the vineyard. She is a member of
Quebec’s Order of Agronomists, holds a Bachelor degree in Agronomy from Laval
University and a certificate in higher agricultural technician (option viticulture
and oenology) from Lycée Petrarch in Avignon in France. More than forty species
have been tested in the field and others are in progress. The sampling field
has more than eight hundred vines. Thousand of hours have been spent ​​in
research to find the right varieties for our climate. A good grape maturity
with potential alcohol levels of 10 to 13% alc/vol, with good acidity ranging
between 3.2 and 3.6 ph, good flavors and good resistance to cold temperature
allow us to target the first cultivars. . Further results are expected, from
different cultivars, which will ensure to improve the quality of our products years
after years. Your investment will directly serve the start, implementation and
investment in planting Domaine Côte du Nord. The first important step is the
purchase of the lands. After comes the building of a greenhouse and preparation
of the land to welcome new vines (land clearing, falsetto, plowing, amendment
and lime, planting, installation of poles, lines and support train the vines’
fruiting). It takes at least 3 years before the first modest harvest. The
latter is scheduled for autumn 2017 and the plants at full capacity in
2019-2020. The grape found in grocery stores (blue, green and red) will be the
basis of the vineyard’s start. These discoveries for transforming our future
wines will be introduced in part this year and next year. The first vintage is
scheduled for 2019 (white and rosé), Cabernet Severnji Madeleine Sylvaner,
Pinot Noir, Baltica.</p>

<p>The terroir</p>
<p>The
geographical location of the municipality of Ragueneau is an ideal choice.
Along the Outardes river, away from the St-Laurent river and North’s winds, and
drained soil properties, the location offers us a proper microclimate. Although
our territory is considered as difficult, there are several advantages with
which we work. The development of Phase I of the project is estimated at $150
000.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The purpose</p>
<p>In 8 or 10
years, we will have built an exceptional vineyards in North Shore. We will
produce high quality table grapes, fresh, fruity and juicy. We will have
diversified products, 100% local. White, rosé, red and <span>passerillé  offering quality that will make the pride of the
North Shore. The products will be available from Tadoussac, passing by
Sacré-Coeur, to Blanc-Sablon. They will closely represent our attachment to our
land, so vast and diverse.</span></p>
<p>Starting such a project will also benefit the
North Shore by stimulating the entrepreuneurship and pushing the agricultural
development in the area of small fruit and, eventually, the transformation
here. Our company is committed to the environment and believes in a diversified
agriculture that promotes local and regional economy.</p>

major investments of more than $20,000 have been made in vine growing, testing,
winemaking and research on the North Shore terroir. Innovation and Development Manicouagan has supported our project in
2012 and 2013. In 2014, Ms. Gaelle Dubé provided technical supports regarding
the research work and establishment of the vineyard. She is a member of
Quebec’s Order of Agronomists, holds a Bachelor degree in Agronomy from Laval
University and a certificate in higher agricultural technician (option viticulture
and oenology) from Lycée Petrarch in Avignon in France. More than forty species
have been tested in the field and others are in progress. The sampling field
has more than eight hundred vines. Thousand of hours have been spent ​​in
research to find the right varieties for our climate. A good grape maturity
with potential alcohol levels of 10 to 13% alc/vol, with good acidity ranging
between 3.2 and 3.6 ph, good flavors and good resistance to cold temperature
allow us to target the first cultivars. . Further results are expected, from
different cultivars, which will ensure to improve the quality of our products years
after years. Your investment will directly serve the start, implementation and
investment in planting Domaine Côte du Nord. The first important step is the
purchase of the lands. After comes the building of a greenhouse and preparation
of the land to welcome new vines (land clearing, falsetto, plowing, amendment
and lime, planting, installation of poles, lines and support train the vines’
fruiting). It takes at least 3 years before the first modest harvest. The
latter is scheduled for autumn 2017 and the plants at full capacity in
2019-2020. The grape found in grocery stores (blue, green and red) will be the
basis of the vineyard’s start. These discoveries for transforming our future
wines will be introduced in part this year and next year. The first vintage is
scheduled for 2019 (white and rosé), Cabernet Severnji Madeleine Sylvaner,
Pinot Noir, Baltica.


The terroir
The
geographical location of the municipality of Ragueneau is an ideal choice.
Along the Outardes river, away from the St-Laurent river and North’s winds, and
drained soil properties, the location offers us a proper microclimate. Although
our territory is considered as difficult, there are several advantages with
which we work. The development of Phase I of the project is estimated at $150
000.




The purpose
In 8 or 10
years, we will have built an exceptional vineyards in North Shore. We will
produce high quality table grapes, fresh, fruity and juicy. We will have
diversified products, 100% local. White, rosé, red and passerillé  offering quality that will make the pride of the
North Shore. The products will be available from Tadoussac, passing by
Sacré-Coeur, to Blanc-Sablon. They will closely represent our attachment to our
land, so vast and diverse.
Starting such a project will also benefit the
North Shore by stimulating the entrepreuneurship and pushing the agricultural
development in the area of small fruit and, eventually, the transformation
here. Our company is committed to the environment and believes in a diversified
agriculture that promotes local and regional economy.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The Impact

This salon will be open to serve
900,000 plus people classified as being disabled in Missouri. There is also an aging population that is expected to increase by 15% in the next fifteen years. The Moore Hair Salon LLC will be able to increase their independence by providing a place that they can come and receive accommodating hair care services.
This total does not including people
who suffer from temporary disability such as a stroke, a broken arm or leg, or
to the young girl who has never had a salon experience because she is in a
wheelchair.
The salon will cater to individuals
with mental and developmental disabilities by providing them a safe and
welcoming environment that they can come to receive hair care services. 
The stylists are patient and
understand that wait time is important. Services are not rushed and
appointments are available. 
People who suffer from cancer can
receive exclusive treatments and privacy in the Moore Hair Salon LLC VIP room.

 A contribution to the Moore Hair Salon LLC will benefit the community by helping people have a better quality of life, by building
self-esteem, by changing the face of beauty and how others treat individuals
with disability. 

Risks & Challenges
Moore Hair Salon LLC is a new
salon concept for the area. There is no precedent to follow. Salon Owner
Katrina Moore and her staff have to do extensive hands-on research analysis and
training to learn different behaviors that many of them have never had
experience with.

A major challenge for the Moore Hair Salon LLC is creating awareness that this service is available because most  individuals with disability tend to keep to themselves and stay home. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Others can help by Liking the Moore Hair Salon LLC page on Facebook and share with friends.  Use the Moore Hair Salon LLC page to tell about friends or family members that can benefit from Moore Hair Salon LLC services.
Recommend the Moore Hair Salon LLC Home Hair Care services to individuals who can not get out and have a traditional salon experience. 
 Introduce Katrina Moore to other beauty and healthcare professionals on LinkedIn.

For the past few years I've split my time between working in the tech industry and pursuing a career in poker. So what brought me to this point in life? Sometime in 2012 I was comfortably working a standard 9-to-5 office gig when I suffered a stomach rupture and was nearly killed when my blood pressure could not be stabilized, resulting in me spending 2 weeks in intensive care. As a further kicker I was later diagnosed with the unpleasant liver disease, PSC. </p>
<p>I think I could be forgiven if I gave in to a life of part time work and taking it easy at that point. Not so! My brush with mortality has made me determined to pursue my ambitions; and with the help of my partner I think we can achieve that. </p>
<p>Poker is soaring in popularity right now, you need only look at events such as the Sky UK Poker Championships and as I type this, Poker is the number 10 most watched game on Twitch.tv. Unfortunately there still remains a conspicuous lack of full time card rooms in many counties, including Norfolk. I aim to bring a dedicated full time, player friendly venue to Norfolk and the surrounding areas. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Plan</h3> <p>I have already begun with much of the planning stages; and secured a large part of the finances; so the project will proceed with or without this funding - it's just a matter of how quickly! Currently our core team consists of 3 members and myself, all with specific strengths when it comes to day to day operations of the business.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise £30,000 to aid towards obtaining the proper licencing and interior fitting on the premises. By raising the funds partially here we are aiming to reduce the amount the business will have to borrow; allowing us to provide a more stable and better experience for members.</p>
<p>In contributing, you are helping to guarantee a dedicated, safe venue that will bring an already popular sport further into the spotlight - as well as create a new entertainment attraction for the surrounding areas.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We may face delays obtaining the necessary licencing- gaming licenses require an application and appeals process. We can overcome this by being flexible on the location; but our primary intention is to offer a convenient venue for all of Norfolk.</p>
<p>Finally, although I have experience running a small business I have not attempted something of this scale before. However I hope to mitigate this risk by relying on the experience of the other team members, 2 of which have multiple years experience running businesses of various types.</p>

</div></div>","The Red Lotus Story



Aloha! My name is Reiko. I’m a sensei, a mom, a martial artist, a fitness enthusiast, a director, a friend… mostly just a girl trying to make the best out of this crazy life. I love keeping people healthy and happy and making a positive contribution to our community in Hawaii.
I own an amazing dojo called Red Lotus Hawaii filled with passionate, dedicated students who inspire me daily. We are the little dojo with the big heart. And my students are my family.





Here at Red Lotus we believe that being a “blackbelt” is a metaphor for personal excellence in all facets of one’s life whether you are 3 years old or 90! We want to motivate you, inspire you, and transform your life.
Motivate. Inspire. Transform.
But recently, we lost our home! Oh no! It was an awful blow.  Thankfully, we have found a new location, and we need your help to make it home. We need new mats, mirrors, bags and safety equipment so that we can keep fighting the good fight and continue making a difference in the lives of our students and our community.
Will you please help us?
 

   
Your ImpactMartial arts and fitness is never just a business. And I never measure the worth of my business with dollar signs. I measure our success by the smiles on the faces of students and their pride in their accomplishments. Some students have been training with us since we opened our doors in 2007!With your help, we can create a space to continue servicing our ohana and community.We need mats and mirrors and equipment to start doing that. We lost our mats and mirrors when we lost our space. We are trying to raise $8500 to replace them and get some new equipment. We will continue working with what we have, but your contributions will directly impact our success as a business and the success and safety of every student that steps onto the mat.

<p><b>The Mission:</b></p>
<p>America’s farmers are rapidly disappearing. The average age
of a farmer in United States is now over 58 years old. Only 6% of farmers are
under the age of 35. While consumer demand for grass-fed and certified organic beef
has drastically increased, the number of commercial cattle available continues
to decrease, with 2013 alone seeing a 5.2% decline in supply. With America’s
farmers disappearing, the questions must be asked, <b>“Who’s going to feed our
country in the future?” </b></p>
<p>This crowdfund campaign gives you and I the ability to
answer “We will!” By helping Willow Springs’ campaign succeed, we’ll be doing
our part to ensure America has enough farmers to meet our needs for quality
food. </p>
<p><b>The Resources:</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide high quality grass-fed beef products

My name is Hannah Becker, and I'm a proud farmer at Willow Springs Farm in Franklin Co., Kansas. Since watching the TV show Bonanza at the young age of four, I've dreamed of becoming a cattle producer. Growing up outside of Washington D.C., my dream of starting a cattle operation seemed next to impossible; however, despite the challenges, I was determined to turn my dream into reality. Graduating with my Bachelor's degree in Animal & Dairy Science, and Master's degree in Business Administration, I headed west to stake my claim on a forgotten piece of land now christened Willow Springs Farm. I've been recognized as a Master Cattle Producer, and completed my Masters of Beef Advocacy and Beef Quality Assurance Certifications. 


At Willow Springs Farm our goal is to provide high quality grass-fed
beef products for our community. We need your help to purchase five bred cows
needed to start our grass-fed beef herd. These cows will produce annual calves
that enter our grass-fed operation, resulting in high quality beef

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>3 Phases to implementing our dreams:</p>
<p>$20K start up with new website including membership/group classes/private sessions/multiple styles. The old site <a href=""http://www.yogalivelink.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.yogalivelink.com</a> will be replaced with a new one to accommodate all the changes for group programs, various schedules, and membership.</p>
<p>$30K includes all of the above and gets the platform built to support instructors start their online studios,  AND YogaLiveLink will provide free classes to underserved population of kids in schools.</p>
<p>$40K will do all of the above and allow us to do a national marketing campaign to assist all the instructors with their online studios and grow the customer base in areas where yoga isn’t readily available or accessible.</p>
<br/><h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>We are YogaLiveLink, the first interactive online private yoga and yoga therapy service available worldwide. We have been dedicated to providing quality, personal, and completely interactive private yoga sessions. This is not a streaming product or cookie cutter video program. You work one on one with your yoga instructor or therapist to address your specific and unique needs. In response to our fanbase demand, we plan to add a NEW program offering, Group Classes. Their dream is to provide the same great service they are currently receiving to a larger population of yogis worldwide. These class sessions will still be interactive. You will join in with a group and your instructor will be be able to interact with you directly because you can see them and they can see you. Yes, there is an opt-out button! Keep reading to see how together we can make this dream a reality.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>The Benefit</h3>
<p>The benefits of Yoga are increased body awareness, circulation, flexibility, mindfulness, focus, overall mental and physical strength and health…. YogaLiveLink offers you the same benefits, but you do not have to leave the house or your hotel room to go to a studio. You can stay where you are as long as you have internet, your laptop with a webcam, and your yoga mat.</p>
<p>Forget the stress making it through traffic on time for your class, finding a babysitter to watch your child while you are at the studio, or getting stuck in the dressing room waiting for an available shower.</p>
<p>You will use YogaLiveLink when your work or life schedule make getting to a studio hard, while on vacation or work related travel, anywhere - anytime. Find your favorite instructor or therapist and take them with you wherever you go.  YogaLiveLink is global and gives you the opportunity to practice yoga with others from around the world. How cool is that?</p>

<h3>The Voice</h3>
<p>""I think everybody knows how vital yoga is for longevity, inner peace, happiness and overall wellness. Now, with YogaLiveLink there are no more excuses. With my busy schedule, I am able to do yoga from the comfort of my home, in total privacy, at the time I choose, with my pets also relaxing around me, at a very convenient price, saving time (no commuting, etc.). I love it and I am able to use YogaLiveLink on a regular basis. Thank you YogaLiveLink! I tell all my friends about YogaLiveLink and many of them have asked if you plan to have group classes.

<h3>The Demand</h3>
<p>1.  <b><i>To answer a call to action:</i></b>  New Group Classes - After providing interactive online private sessions for cancer patients for the last 2 years, many of our clients expressed the need for more affordable options. For many, the stress and expense of their treatments make it challenging to pay for private sessions. We are ready to act on the demand of the many fans who seek our specialized service by providing a NEW Group Class format to attract a broader base of yogis throughout the US and beyond. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2. </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>To support others in their business endeavors:</i></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  New Opportunities for Yoga Instructors and Yoga Therapists -  YogaLiveLink is also building a platform for yoga instructors and therapists who are interested in establishing their own online yoga studio, under our name, without the brick and mortar expenses. We will provide everything they need online and assist in marketing. This is an incredible opportunity for any yoga instructor or yoga therapist who is looking for more billable hours and building their reputation and clientele.</span></p>
<br/>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>Our NEW class schedule will accommodate our current clientele and open up opportunities to those who do not have access or time to go to a studio. Our fans see the value in our service and feel strongly that YogaLiveLink should provide affordable alternative group programs to serve the masses. In addition, to the present interactive online private sessions, we will implement a membership model and the opportunity to take LIVE group classes. Interactive yoga is far superior to streaming a class because, if you like, the instructor can see you and can accommodate your personal needs, monitor your development, and help you practice yoga safely. And, this is available for people worldwide. Yoga for everyone!</p>

The benefits of Yoga are increased body awareness, circulation, flexibility, mindfulness, focus, overall mental and physical strength and health…. YogaLiveLink offers you the same benefits, but you do not have to leave the house or your hotel room to go to a studio. You can stay where you are as long as you have internet, your laptop with a webcam, and your yoga mat.
Forget the stress making it through traffic on time for your class, finding a babysitter to watch your child while you are at the studio, or getting stuck in the dressing room waiting for an available shower.
You will use YogaLiveLink when your work or life schedule make getting to a studio hard, while on vacation or work related travel, anywhere - anytime. Find your favorite instructor or therapist and take them with you wherever you go.  YogaLiveLink is global and gives you the opportunity to practice yoga with others from around the world. How cool is that?


The Voice
""I think everybody knows how vital yoga is for longevity, inner peace, happiness and overall wellness. Now, with YogaLiveLink there are no more excuses. With my busy schedule, I am able to do yoga from the comfort of my home, in total privacy, at the time I choose, with my pets also relaxing around me, at a very convenient price, saving time (no commuting, etc.). I love it and I am able to use YogaLiveLink on a regular basis. Thank you YogaLiveLink! I tell all my friends about YogaLiveLink and many of them have asked if you plan to have group classes. Will you add that service, please?"" ~Elena Pezzini, Ph.D






The Demand
1.  To answer a call to action:  New Group Classes - After providing interactive online private sessions for cancer patients for the last 2 years, many of our clients expressed the need for more affordable options. For many, the stress and expense of their treatments make it challenging to pay for private sessions. We are ready to act on the demand of the many fans who seek our specialized service by providing a NEW Group Class format to attract a broader base of yogis throughout the US and beyond. 
2. To support others in their business endeavors:  New Opportunities for Yoga Instructors and Yoga Therapists -  YogaLiveLink is also building a platform for yoga instructors and therapists who are interested in establishing their own online yoga studio, under our name, without the brick and mortar expenses. We will provide everything they need online and assist in marketing. This is an incredible opportunity for any yoga instructor or yoga therapist who is looking for more billable hours and building their reputation and clientele.

    The Impact 

Our NEW class schedule will accommodate our current clientele and open up opportunities to those who do not have access or time to go to a studio. Our fans see the value in our service and feel strongly that YogaLiveLink should provide affordable alternative group programs to serve the masses. In addition, to the present interactive online private sessions, we will implement a membership model and the opportunity to take LIVE group classes. Interactive yoga is far superior to streaming a class because, if you like, the instructor can see you and can accommodate your personal needs, monitor your development, and help you practice yoga safely. And, this is available for people worldwide. Yoga for everyone!

<br/>Harambee Properties was started in order to develop communities that connect and bring residents together in ways that many land development companies do not.  The word Harambee literally means ""All pull together"".  While many have been fortunate to see empowerment happen individually, we still believe that our communities can do better.  We know that inequity is real.  We believe that we can do better. It's time we refocus how we live. Inequity does not have to be a norm, nor does it mean taking from others.  We must examine the structure, means, and results of how we live, why we do it, and where we can change it.  There is never just one right answer or solution, but rather a set or series of solutions.  Harambee Properties believes our approach to pocket communities is one of the solutions.  We are not just buying land, building a few houses, and letting the 
cards fall where they may.  We will start with the people, their skills,
 needs, and desires.  Then we will develop the pocket community based on
 those strengths and needs, taking steps to ensure the community has the
 tools to adapt, maintain, and grow.<br/><br/>We chose the city of Ferguson, MO for our initial project because it  has many of the right pieces that will allow our project to thrive.  Ferguson is rich with good people and small businesses.  It is growing in many ways, yet has the character and stability of an established town.  But like anywhere, inequity is very real.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p>

<p><span><span>Pocket communities aren't new, they are tried and true all over the world in one form or another.  Harambee recognizes that community is not just a set of houses, but a set of people who are connected to work and live together. It
 is critical to recruit residents first.  Together we develop the 
community around collective knowledge, skills, needs, and desires. Next we create an economic base so our pocket community can be self-sufficient and perhaps even income generating. That economic base could be a community garden, child development center, 
artist studio, LEED consultants, etc. depending on the residents needs, skills, and level of revenue generation needed. This component builds skill, creates jobs, as well as provides learning opportunities for residents and neighbors.  This is one reason we want to start with one 
pocket community.  It's not like a traditional land development.  We are
 starting with people first, then building.  That takes more insight, 
thoughtfulness, and cooperation.</span></span><br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>The estimated project cost for six small/tiny houses (ranging between 130 sqft - 700 sqft) plus one common building is $250,000.  This includes land purchase, construction materials, and land preparation as needed. <br/></p>
<p>This campaign is to help get us started.  Most grants, small business start up loans, and other traditional funding sources prohibit land/real estate purchase. While tiny houses on wheels can be built in any backyard space, we would like to have a ""home lot"" to develop and plan around.  Of course we would love to be totally funded through this campaign, however we are asking for your help with the<b> first $150,000. <br/></b></p>
<p>Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase a lot(s) up to 1 acre w/ existing structure <br/>
</li>
<li>Build 1 tiny house and retrofit/remodel/repair existing structure<br/>
</li>
<li>Initial administrative costs (i.e. marketing, recruitment, training, local permits, site maintenance, campaign fees, etc.)</li>
<li>Site preparation such as installing electric, water, and sewage systems for the additional 6 sites. (remember these are small and tiny homes whose electric usage will likely be less than $600/yr on average.</li>
<li>Rewards acquisition &amp; distribution back to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our full intent is to partner with community organizations and businesses to complete this project.  We have already begun speaking with organizations like Youthbuild for remodeling and construction partnerships. We fully intend to seek product sponsorship, training partnerships with local and national educational and professional services.<br/></p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>You work hard.  But far too many of us, work hard just to scrape by as the cost of living requires more and more of what we earn.  Just imagine if the bulk of your resources (the money, time, and benefits you earn) were available to you after you've paid all your living expenses!  What would you do?  This is the quintessential ""If I was rich or won the lottery"" question. Living in or supporting a tiny/small house pocket community allows for a shift in priorities; valuing experience over material, production over consumption.  We all work hard with ultimate goal of ensuring our family's health and safety so that we may enjoy each other and our surroundings. <br/></p> <ul> <li>Starting with the small house with the smart design - These homes are designed to not only be ecologically smart and sustainable, but economically smart as well.  We will intentionally design homes that fit well into a maximum 10 year financial package, yet still below traditional housing rates.  This frees up some financial resources now, but eliminates one of our biggest financial constraints in as soon as now (for those who want to pay cash for/sweat equity our smallest home) up to 10 years for those who opt for a bigger home.</li>

</li>
<li>Additionally, these homes will be designed to be energy and time efficient. Spending significantly less on energy and water consumption, as well as time spent cleaning and maintaining. <br/>
</li>
<li>Shared common space gives our residents prime access to green space, and additional space for various use such as get-togethers, safe outdoor play, hobbies, etc.  The shared common space also fosters cooperation, connectivity, improved security, and a real sense of community. </li>
<li>The economic base, whether it be a community garden, art studio/gallery, LEED or other certification station, etc, allows for income to be generated and cover the cost of routine community maintenance and improvements.  This will lower or replace neighborhood association fees, potentially generate income.<br/>
</li> <li>The development and operation of the pocket community will utilize local youth and other workers, building a skill base that will be available to our pocket community and the community at large.  The training and education will be incorporated as an ongoing resource.  Community members will gain skills up to expertise level that will allow them to maintain their own community, assist others, as well as consult on other projects if they desire.<br/><ul>

</div><p>My memories of Nepal are happy ones. They are an eight year old's memories. <br/></p><div>
</div><p>However, in the aftermath of the ten year civil war (1996-2006) many children were left orphaned, or with devastatingly impoverished families. Forced from their villages through fear of the war or of the forced conscription, many families fled to Kathmandu and often ended up in states of more poverty and/or corruption. Families in the isolated rural villages were easy prey for child traffickers, who promised their children good education and better lives. But the reality was that the children were deposited in unregistered 'orphanages' where they did not attend school, were malnourished, forced into servitude and often abused. </p><div>
</div><p>Human trafficking is one of the fastest growing criminal activities in the world. 41% of Nepal's population are aged under 16. For a country with a population of approximately 27 million, that's nearly 13 million children, many of whom are potentially at risk.<br/></p><div>
</div><p>The Umbrella Foundation was established in 2005 as a direct response to this problem. Umbrella strives to create safe, healthy, happy, and nurturing home environments for these rescued children and youth, with the view of reintegrating them back with their families/communities of origin. <br/></p><div>
</div><p><b>What Am I Doing to Help?</b><br/></p><div>
</div><p>I am in my final term in the University of Victoria's Child and Youth Care Program. During this degree, students are required to work through three practicum placements. I have been given an amazing opportunity to work as a fourth year practicum student with the Umbrella Foundation in one of their childcare homes, in the suburb of Swayambhu, in Kathmandu. </p><div>
</div><p>During my time with Umbrella I will be working directly with the children and communities within the childcare home. Umbrella holds a strong value of education and our role as volunteers is to promote this within the children; from walking them to school, to aiding them in completing assignments. Volunteers live in a separate location to the children and youth; there is a volunteer house within walking distance of all of the three childcare homes. <br/></p><div>
</div><p>I am incredibly excited about this opportunity. I believe in what the Umbrella Foundation is doing and I feel blessed to be able to contribute in my own way. <br/></p><div>
</div><p><b>Why Am I Asking For Money?</b></p><div>
</div><p>As a part of the agreement between the Umbrella Foundation and their volunteers, it is required that each individual brings with them a monetary contribution. This money covers the volunteers expenses (roughly $490 for three months) which includes rent for staying in the volunteer house, two meals a day in the children's houses and the running costs of the program. The remaining contribution ALL goes to Umbrella for the direct care of the children!</p><div>
</div><p>I hope to raise more money than the requirement of my contract. I believe that this cause is a worthy one and one which directly impacts the demographic at risk. My knowledge of Umbrella is that they operate in a way which is very transparent in regards to their intentions. The money being gathered is used directly to benefit the children's education, health and well being. <br/></p><div>
</div><p><b>Why Am I Doing This?</b><br/></p><div>
</div><p>As I begin the last term of my degree, with four years of theory and law and statistics and research and psychology and development and counseling training behind me...I know two things with absolute clarity; <br/></p><div>
</div><p>One, is to always speak from the heart, to be honest and to walk with integrity. In any avenue of life, but specifically when working with people. <br/></p><div>
</div><p>Two, is the importance of advocacy. I believe, with every fiber of my being in
people’s right to information and education. This, to me, is what advocacy
means. This is my drive behind the work that I do currently and the work which
I hope to pursue in the future. I want to be an advocate for those who perhaps
are unable to be an advocate for themselves due to their circumstances. I
believe that it is a great injustice, which exists blatantly ‘invisible’ within
our world, that individuals are forced to survive their existence without
understanding their rights. </p><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>I want to provide a space for advocacy. I want to
work to address the dichotomy between those with power of knowledge and those who
have been disadvantaged by the systems which limit their access to that same
information. <br/></p><div>
</div><p>This is my driving force and the piece which I commit to bringing to my work wherever I go. <br/></p><div>
</div><p>I see the Umbrella Foundation as a project which encapsulates so many of my own values surrounding human and social development work. I believe in their mission statements, their values, and all of the people within the organization to whom I have spoken have been genuine, helpful, passionate, and gone above and beyond to aid me through this process. To me, this speaks to the caliber of the organization itself. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help!</b><br/></p><div>I also want to recognize the fact that not everyone is in a position which they are able/comfortable to contribute financially. That's okay! But, if you believe in what I'm doing and would like to help me out in a different way, please send this along to your own friends and family. Whether that creates more money or not isn't the point for me, the point is about awareness and the sharing of a story which I believe to be of value. </div><div>
<strong></strong><p><b>My Commitment to You</b></p>
<p>In return for your financial contributions, I commit to sharing my story, photos, and experiences with you. I will be writing a travel blog during my time in Nepal which I would love to share with you as a way of giving you some insight into how your money is being used.  This blog will be up and running closer to my leaving date (May 15th) and I will email out a link when it is ready. </p>If you would like some more information regarding human trafficking, specifically in Nepal, I wrote a research paper this year for one of my courses which summarizes some of the information available. I would be delighted to email a copy to anyone who would like to know a little more about this subject. <br/><strong>

Why Am I Doing This?
As I begin the last term of my degree, with four years of theory and law and statistics and research and psychology and development and counseling training behind me...I know two things with absolute clarity; 
One, is to always speak from the heart, to be honest and to walk with integrity. In any avenue of life, but specifically when working with people. 
Two, is the importance of advocacy. I believe, with every fiber of my being in
people’s right to information and education. This, to me, is what advocacy
means. This is my drive behind the work that I do currently and the work which
I hope to pursue in the future. I want to be an advocate for those who perhaps
are unable to be an advocate for themselves due to their circumstances. I
believe that it is a great injustice, which exists blatantly ‘invisible’ within
our world, that individuals are forced to survive their existence without
understanding their rights. 


I want to provide a space for advocacy. I want to
work to address the dichotomy between those with power of knowledge and those who
have been disadvantaged by the systems which limit their access to that same
information. 
This is my driving force and the piece which I commit to bringing to my work wherever I go. 
I see the Umbrella Foundation as a project which encapsulates so many of my own values surrounding human and social development work. I believe in their mission statements, their values, and all of the people within the organization to whom I have spoken have been genuine, helpful, passionate, and gone above and beyond to aid me through this process. To me, this speaks to the caliber of the organization itself. 
Other Ways You Can Help!I also want to recognize the fact that not everyone is in a position which they are able/comfortable to contribute financially. That's okay! But, if you believe in what I'm doing and would like to help me out in a different way, please send this along to your own friends and family. Whether that creates more money or not isn't the point for me, the point is about awareness and the sharing of a story which I believe to be of value. 
My Commitment to You
In return for your financial contributions, I commit to sharing my story, photos, and experiences with you. I will be writing a travel blog during my time in Nepal which I would love to share with you as a way of giving you some insight into how your money is being used.  This blog will be up and running closer to my leaving date (May 15th) and I will email out a link when it is ready. If you would like some more information regarding human trafficking, specifically in Nepal, I wrote a research paper this year for one of my courses which summarizes some of the information available. I would be delighted to email a copy to anyone who would like to know a little more about this subject.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p><b>Our
Mission </b></p>
<p>The mission of the Abundance
Co-operative Academy is to create an economically productive organic farm,
which resembles an ecosystem in its promotion of biological diversity, while
producing healthy and affordable food for communities in Nova Scotia. Food
security is the foundation for our ultimate goal; developing a
self-sufficient community, comprised of sustainable infrastructure, and driven
by renewable energy.</p>
<p><b>Why
is Our Project Important? </b></p>
<p>There
exists a growing population of Nova Scotians who are interested in, but do not
have access to affordable, locally grown, organic food. Our Farm will provide organic vegetables to
communities across NS, specifically within the Halifax and South Shore areas. </p>
<p>We hope to provide a blueprint of
sustainability to the youth of the present and future. Our success will be an
example that they too can create an environmentally responsible living space
for themselves and their communities.</p>
<p><b>Techniques
&amp; Strategies </b></p>
<p>Our strategies for becoming a highly productive farm
include the integration of techniques and strategies used by the some of the
best polyculture and permaculture farmers. Our farm will use many techniques
innovated by Jean-Martin Fortier and Stefan Sobkowiak from Quebec, who have
proven their techniques with great success. Jean-Martin has created a
high-efficiency polyculture farm on an acre and a half and produces over $150
000 of gross income with a 40% profit margin! </p>
<p>One technique, for example, is
companion planting. When symbiotic plants are cultivated correctly, it results
in increased resilience to climactic extremes, pest and disease resistance,
increased nutrient and mineral density and promotion of soil fertility.</p>
<p>A common example of this is corn, beans and squash, known
as “The Three Sisters”. The cornstalks form a
trellis for the beans to climb. The beans, in turn, draw nitrogen from the air,
and via symbiotic bacteria convert the nitrogen to plant-available form. The
broad leaves of the squash form a dense ground cover, inhibiting weeds and
keeping the soil cool and moist! Stefan Sobkowiak successfully uses this technique in his
orchard.</p>
<p>Sobkowiak also focuses on promoting biological diversity
by creating habitats for many species of birds and bees. Encouraging biological
allies increases the health of the ecosystem, which is fundamental to obtaining
a high yield. Birds are the most effective way to control malicious insects
that destroy crops. Bees pollinate plants, which is an essential stage of a
plant's life cycle. Also, the amount of pollination is proportional to the
plants' yield, so the more bees, the higher the production. We will be using
these techniques as well as cultivating worms and mycelium. Worms create
tunnels that allow oxygen and water to penetrate deep into the soil. A high
worm population in the soil increases the rate of decomposition of organic
matter, which ensures essential nutrients are available to the plants at every
stage of growth. Mycorrhiza mycelium is a type of fungus that attaches to the
roots of plants. The mycelium exchanges nutrients and acts as a signalling
system for the plants. If one plant is under attack, it can use the mycelium
connection to communicate to the other plants to protect themselves!
Propagating these four biological allies will drastically increase the
potential yield on the farm.</p>
<p>We will dig a pond near the barn so we can use the
rainwater that falls on the roof to irrigate the crops. The water will then be
pumped up to the drip lines in the field. The drip irrigation is an efficient
way of irrigating the crops because minimal water is lost to evaporation. We
will also need to construct a fence that will keep out deer and other animals
that feed on crops. As our farm becomes established, we will be investing in
additional water retention features, such as ponds and swales, as well as fruit
and nut trees, with the goal of creating a more self-regulating perennial
ecosystem.</p>
<p>By reducing labour inputs through the use of appropriate
technologies, increasing planting density, diligent crop planning, and focusing
on building soil fertility, it is possible to run an economically viable farm
with minimal start-up costs. Additionally,
all revenue from our produce will be used to further develop the farm and
expand our production so that we can serve a larger portion of the community. Once our farm is an established producer of organic food,
we will focus on the transition to a totally sustainable community. This plan
includes generating clean energy, which will support sustainable
infrastructure, providing a healthy and environmentally responsible living
space.</p>
<p><b>Innovation
</b></p>
<p>Beyond the techniques described above, what sets us apart
from other growers is our innovative distribution and pricing system. </p>
<p>We will be offering subscriptions to an online store that
will indicate which vegetables are ready to harvest along with an approximate
market value for each. Subscribers will be able to choose the quantity and
variety of vegetables in their order based on each week’s harvest, as well as
how much they want to pay for the order. </p>
<p>This pay-what-you-want pricing strategy has been utilized
by community-oriented businesses to establish strong relationships and loyal
customer bases. This innovative business model will revolutionize the way
people access locally grown organic food by providing a customizable online
ordering platform, as well as a flexible range of payment options.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need </b></p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will be going towards
purchasing tools, supplies, seeds and infrastructure. Here is an estimation of
the major starting costs of our project: </p>
<p><u>Garden
Supplies &amp; Tools: </u></p>
<p>Black tarps - $400 </p>
<p>Wheel barrows &amp; hand tools (shovels, rakes and hoes)

<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>There are many risks associated with farming because
there is so much to learn and the climate is always changing. This project is
driven by a volunteer labour force with the common desire of developing a
sustainable community. There is a financial risk that comes with this pursuit,
since we are sacrificing personal incomes to bring this collective vision into
reality.</p>
<p>The reason we are willing to take such a risk is because
we are passionate about this project. Our passion will give us the tenacity to
overcome the challenges we will face. We understand that mistakes and failures
are a part of learning. We appreciate that learning from our mistakes and
failures give us strength and wisdom. We are determined to make this project
successful.</p>

Mission 
The mission of the Abundance
Co-operative Academy is to create an economically productive organic farm,
which resembles an ecosystem in its promotion of biological diversity, while
producing healthy and affordable food for communities in Nova Scotia. Food
security is the foundation for our ultimate goal; developing a
self-sufficient community, comprised of sustainable infrastructure, and driven
by renewable energy.
Why
is Our Project Important? 
There
exists a growing population of Nova Scotians who are interested in, but do not
have access to affordable, locally grown, organic food. Our Farm will provide organic vegetables to
communities across NS, specifically within the Halifax and South Shore areas. 
We hope to provide a blueprint of
sustainability to the youth of the present and future. Our success will be an
example that they too can create an environmentally responsible living space
for themselves and their communities.
Techniques
& Strategies 
Our strategies for becoming a highly productive farm
include the integration of techniques and strategies used by the some of the
best polyculture and permaculture farmers. Our farm will use many techniques
innovated by Jean-Martin Fortier and Stefan Sobkowiak from Quebec, who have
proven their techniques with great success. Jean-Martin has created a
high-efficiency polyculture farm on an acre and a half and produces over $150
000 of gross income with a 40% profit margin! 
One technique, for example, is
companion planting. When symbiotic plants are cultivated correctly, it results
in increased resilience to climactic extremes, pest and disease resistance,
increased nutrient and mineral density and promotion of soil fertility.
A common example of this is corn, beans and squash, known
as “The Three Sisters”. The cornstalks form a
trellis for the beans to climb. The beans, in turn, draw nitrogen from the air,
and via symbiotic bacteria convert the nitrogen to plant-available form. The
broad leaves of the squash form a dense ground cover, inhibiting weeds and
keeping the soil cool and moist! Stefan Sobkowiak successfully uses this technique in his
orchard.
Sobkowiak also focuses on promoting biological diversity
by creating habitats for many species of birds and bees. Encouraging biological
allies increases the health of the ecosystem, which is fundamental to obtaining
a high yield. Birds are the most effective way to control malicious insects
that destroy crops. Bees pollinate plants, which is an essential stage of a
plant's life cycle. Also, the amount of pollination is proportional to the
plants' yield, so the more bees, the higher the production. We will be using
these techniques as well as cultivating worms and mycelium. Worms create
tunnels that allow oxygen and water to penetrate deep into the soil. A high
worm population in the soil increases the rate of decomposition of organic
matter, which ensures essential nutrients are available to the plants at every
stage of growth. Mycorrhiza mycelium is a type of fungus that attaches to the
roots of plants. The mycelium exchanges nutrients and acts as a signalling
system for the plants. If one plant is under attack, it can use the mycelium
connection to communicate to the other plants to protect themselves!
Propagating these four biological allies will drastically increase the
potential yield on the farm.
We will dig a pond near the barn so we can use the
rainwater that falls on the roof to irrigate the crops. The water will then be
pumped up to the drip lines in the field. The drip irrigation is an efficient
way of irrigating the crops because minimal water is lost to evaporation. We
will also need to construct a fence that will keep out deer and other animals
that feed on crops. As our farm becomes established, we will be investing in
additional water retention features, such as ponds and swales, as well as fruit
and nut trees, with the goal of creating a more self-regulating perennial
ecosystem.
By reducing labour inputs through the use of appropriate
technologies, increasing planting density, diligent crop planning, and focusing
on building soil fertility, it is possible to run an economically viable farm
with minimal start-up costs. Additionally,
all revenue from our produce will be used to further develop the farm and
expand our production so that we can serve a larger portion of the community. Once our farm is an established producer of organic food,
we will focus on the transition to a totally sustainable community. This plan
includes generating clean energy, which will support sustainable
infrastructure, providing a healthy and environmentally responsible living
space.
Innovation

Beyond the techniques described above, what sets us apart
from other growers is our innovative distribution and pricing system. 
We will be offering subscriptions to an online store that
will indicate which vegetables are ready to harvest along with an approximate
market value for each. Subscribers will be able to choose the quantity and
variety of vegetables in their order based on each week’s harvest, as well as
how much they want to pay for the order. 
This pay-what-you-want pricing strategy has been utilized
by community-oriented businesses to establish strong relationships and loyal
customer bases. This innovative business model will revolutionize the way
people access locally grown organic food by providing a customizable online
ordering platform, as well as a flexible range of payment options.

I was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but I've been a chef and pub owner for more than 20 years here in the U.S. Of all the restaurants and bars I've experienced here, the one thing I've missed the most is an authentic Northern Irish pub. Oh, there are plenty of Irish pubs around, especially if you like leprechauns and four-leaf clovers. But a Northern Irish pub is a whole different thing than a southern Irish pub, because Northern Ireland is a whole different place. Northern Ireland is as once beautiful and haunting, heartbreaking and inspiring, with culture, cuisine, history, music and traditions all its own. I want to share that with you in my first authentic Northern Irish pub, The Glensman.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What's different about The Glensman? In one word: everything.  The menu features traditional Northern Irish dishes like mackerel and prawns sourced and brought in fresh direct from Northern Irish waters. Northern Irish beers and whiskeys will take center stage, like Bushmills, Dunville, and Tennent's lager, with monthly beer and whiskey club meetings to taste new offerings.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But the heart and soul of The Glensman is our culture. Northern Ireland has seen brutal periods in our history. I grew up during some of the worst of The Troubles in the 1970s. The effects of those terrible times show in our music and our art, which you'll experience in The Glensman. You'll hear the likes of Stiff Little Fingers, The Undertones, and of course, my fellow Belfast man, Van Morrison, while you have the chance to learn more about why Northern Ireland is the way it is through art, photos and stories throughout the pub. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Donating to The Glensman pub project means a lot more than helping to open a restaurant. Sharing our Northern Irish history and culture helps us all better understand why Northern Irish people share solidarity and a commitment to community. Our commitment to community in The Glensman's culture is demonstrated in our partnership with non-profits that build families and communities up, like the Ars Bellum Foundation, which helps veterans with PTSD using art therapy. For us, a great pub experience means a great community experience, and we want to be part of the fabric of our neighborhoods.

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Dominic McMahon. I was born and raised in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but I've been a chef and pub owner for more than 20 years here in the U.S. Of all the restaurants and bars I've experienced here, the one thing I've missed the most is an authentic Northern Irish pub. Oh, there are plenty of Irish pubs around, especially if you like leprechauns and four-leaf clovers. But a Northern Irish pub is a whole different thing than a southern Irish pub, because Northern Ireland is a whole different place. Northern Ireland is as once beautiful and haunting, heartbreaking and inspiring, with culture, cuisine, history, music and traditions all its own. I want to share that with you in my first authentic Northern Irish pub, The Glensman.
What's different about The Glensman? In one word: everything.  The menu features traditional Northern Irish dishes like mackerel and prawns sourced and brought in fresh direct from Northern Irish waters. Northern Irish beers and whiskeys will take center stage, like Bushmills, Dunville, and Tennent's lager, with monthly beer and whiskey club meetings to taste new offerings.  
But the heart and soul of The Glensman is our culture. Northern Ireland has seen brutal periods in our history. I grew up during some of the worst of The Troubles in the 1970s. The effects of those terrible times show in our music and our art, which you'll experience in The Glensman. You'll hear the likes of Stiff Little Fingers, The Undertones, and of course, my fellow Belfast man, Van Morrison, while you have the chance to learn more about why Northern Ireland is the way it is through art, photos and stories throughout the pub. 
Donating to The Glensman pub project means a lot more than helping to open a restaurant. Sharing our Northern Irish history and culture helps us all better understand why Northern Irish people share solidarity and a commitment to community. Our commitment to community in The Glensman's culture is demonstrated in our partnership with non-profits that build families and communities up, like the Ars Bellum Foundation, which helps veterans with PTSD using art therapy. For us, a great pub experience means a great community experience, and we want to be part of the fabric of our neighborhoods. You can help make that happen.   We're in the home stretch We've already started the project. We've taken a broken down, empty restaurant shell on Grand Avenue in St. Paul, and we're bringing it back to life. My partner, Kevin Naughton, and I have put $140,000 into The Glensman already, and the building's owner has contributed significant investments in upgrading its infrastructure.

<strong>
</strong><h2>In Summary </h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>We are a student driven service project that is geared towards creating a youth friendly Santa Fe community. We are currently working towards goals that include:</p>
<p>Teen Events: The main focus is to plan, schedule, and attend the events the group of active teens have envisioned. </p>
<p>Changing Stereotypes: This group is focused on changing the negative stereotypes that are applied to the youth and teens in the Santa Fe area.</p>
<p>A Poetree Art Installation: By creating a series of tree like sculptures for people to display poems and other verbal works of art on “leaves” ( which will be made of different colored light filters), this group is developing a creative outlet and interactive art exhibit for the people of our community.</p>
<p>AMPED Productions: AMPED  was founded on the notion that everyone and every teen in Santa Fe deserves the chance to express themselves  through performance, music, and visual arts. This group of young people is currently working on producing new music.</p>
<p>A Graffiti Wall Art Installation: This art installation would feature a permanent graffiti mural on one side of a wall. The other side of the wall will serve as a blank canvas for young graffiti artists to practice their art legally and without damaging property.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2> What We Need:</h2>
<div>We need money to pay for events, publicity, art supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. We would also accept donations of supplies for art installations and events. The Poetree and Graffiti Wall groups need paint and building supplies to create their produts. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h2> Impact:</h2>
<div>Through creative place making, we are promoting an active and engaged youth culture in the Santa Fe Community.  We are also adding to the vibrant local art culture as a whole in Santa Fe. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h2>Challenges: </h2>
<div>One of our challenges is reaching the youth community in Santa Fe.  There are lots of interesting things going on in Santa Fe that no one knows about. Teens can't participate in events when they do not know about them. </div>
<div>Another obstacle to our goals is that Santa Fe seems to have an economic and recreational environment that is geared to an older generation and tourists. This can lead to issues getting support for our youth oriented projects.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h2>How You Can Help:</h2>
<div>You can help make our impact stronger by donating the following: </div>
<div><ul>
<li>money for all sorts of miscellaneous expenditures</li>
<li>supplies for events including: foam dodge balls, glow paint, kickballs, volleyballs, other sporting equipment, and water coolers.</li>
<li>music production equipment</li>
<li>paint and other art supplies including: canvases, spray paint, scissors, glue, markers, tape, acrylic paints, paper, and glitter.</li>
<li>building supplies including: wood, hinges, screwdrivers, nails,screws, wood glue, hammers, palates, plywood, rope, clamps, etc. </li>
<li>more money</li>
<li>your time and energy working alongside empowered youth</li>
<li>Help with advertising campaigns and promotion</li>
</ul></div>

We are a student driven service project that is geared towards creating a youth friendly Santa Fe community. We are currently working towards goals that include:
Teen Events: The main focus is to plan, schedule, and attend the events the group of active teens have envisioned. 
Changing Stereotypes: This group is focused on changing the negative stereotypes that are applied to the youth and teens in the Santa Fe area.
A Poetree Art Installation: By creating a series of tree like sculptures for people to display poems and other verbal works of art on “leaves” ( which will be made of different colored light filters), this group is developing a creative outlet and interactive art exhibit for the people of our community.
AMPED Productions: AMPED  was founded on the notion that everyone and every teen in Santa Fe deserves the chance to express themselves  through performance, music, and visual arts. This group of young people is currently working on producing new music.
A Graffiti Wall Art Installation: This art installation would feature a permanent graffiti mural on one side of a wall. The other side of the wall will serve as a blank canvas for young graffiti artists to practice their art legally and without damaging property.

 What We Need:
We need money to pay for events, publicity, art supplies, and other miscellaneous expenses. We would also accept donations of supplies for art installations and events. The Poetree and Graffiti Wall groups need paint and building supplies to create their produts. 

 Impact:
Through creative place making, we are promoting an active and engaged youth culture in the Santa Fe Community.  We are also adding to the vibrant local art culture as a whole in Santa Fe. 

Challenges: 
One of our challenges is reaching the youth community in Santa Fe.  There are lots of interesting things going on in Santa Fe that no one knows about. Teens can't participate in events when they do not know about them. 
Another obstacle to our goals is that Santa Fe seems to have an economic and recreational environment that is geared to an older generation and tourists. This can lead to issues getting support for our youth oriented projects.

How You Can Help:
You can help make our impact stronger by donating the following: 

money for all sorts of miscellaneous expenditures
supplies for events including: foam dodge balls, glow paint, kickballs, volleyballs, other sporting equipment, and water coolers.
music production equipment
paint and other art supplies including: canvases, spray paint, scissors, glue, markers, tape, acrylic paints, paper, and glitter.
building supplies including: wood, hinges, screwdrivers, nails,screws, wood glue, hammers, palates, plywood, rope, clamps, etc. 
more money
your time and energy working alongside empowered youth
Help with advertising campaigns and promotion

If you are unable to contribute in any of those we would also appreciate it if you could spread the word about our project by liking us on Facebook or other forms of social media.
you can also help by offering your support, skills, political connections etc. to help us get our projects completed.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Philadelphia is surrounded by farms, yet it is considered to be one of the largest food deserts in the United States. The first neighborhood grocery store was only made available to local Temple students and residents in 2010. Additionally, there is only one vegan food establishment out of approximately thirty on or near campus. A fruit truck and farmers market also frequent Temple's campus, but do not serve as a consistent option for students to purchase prepared, fresh meals.This means that there is one establishment that offers prepared plant based meals consistently.</p>
<p> We see that the food truck culture at Temple University is growing increasingly strong with the Crepe truck, various taco trucks, insomnia cookie truck, Halal carts, smoothie trucks, and that there is a simultaneous rising interest in health awareness as well as sustainability. The Temple new co-op in Ritter Hall, 'The Radish' and the farmers market on Thursdays are perfect examples of this. We believe that the food truck culture will give us the vehicle to offer affordable fresh options to an eager community. Vegans, vegetarian, and health conscious eaters have expressed great interest and support for this idea. We believe that there is a great need for our food, as well as a population that will be receptive to sustainability practices, and fitness culture! </p>
<p><span><i>We promise to empower students, community, and faculty members by serving nutritious food at an affordable price, becoming a platform for fitness, reducing our impact on the environment, and inspiring others to live spontaneously.</i></span></p>
<p><span>Some of our future goals include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Sponsoring: FREE running, meditation, and yoga classes to encourage a culture of physical fitness for all levels at Temple University ...oh and you may find yourself in the midst of a dance party with us if you get lucky. </li>
<li>Encouraging: An eco-friendly mindset by modeling sustainable business practices. This includes growing our herbs, some veggies, and spices on the top and sides of our truck! </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fostering: Nutritional awareness through continual research. We will work with a nutritionist to design truck signage that provides customers with nutritional information about menu items. This will be presented in easily understandable percentages, rather than metric measurements or calorie counts. Percentages will encourage customers from 'veteran vegans' to 'veg curious' to monitor their sugar, fat, salt, protein, fiber, and carbohydrate intake in a clear, simple, cumulative way.  </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Supporting: Local farmers by meeting with and establishing personal relationships with local farms. Fruits and vegetables available for recipes will also shift according to growing season, environmental impact, and availability. Happy Hippy will stay loyal to local farmers by expanding and being flexible with their product purchasing options to provide a steady source of income to local farmers</span></li>
<li>Our truck will be FUN and approachable. You will always be able to find us IN the truck following our passions for cooking, fitness, and a life filled with fun. We want to hear about your dreams, encourage you along your journey, swap stories, create lasting relationships, and build a supportive communal network.

<h3>Our Food</h3>
<p><i>""Life expectancy would grow by leaps and bounds if green vegetables tasted like bacon."" -Doug Larson</i></p>
<p>Ok...think back to the last time that you ate multiple delicious slices of pizza and a soda for lunch. How did you feel? Admit it....we've all been there...most likely sluggish and foggy. Sometimes we call this food situation a 'food coma.' At Happy Hippy we still believe in dazzling your taste buds and your senses but WITHOUT weighing your body down. Food is fuel for our bodies and minds to move!! Plant based food is easily broken down, used, and expelled from the body, leaving you fueled and feeling fresh to take on your busy day! </p>
<p>Nicole loves to travel and experiment with food. When she was living in Thailand she learned to cook  without using any words! The language barrier between her and her host aunt resulted in Nicole learning to cook delicious Thai dishes through hand gestures, motions, and using her sense of smell, taste, and touch! She has adopted this strategy into her cooking and hardly ever uses recipes.  She enjoys the freedom and the challenge that cooking with your senses creates. Happy Hippy original dishes will be crafted in this spirit. Our challenge is to make these dishes as wholesome as possible to keep you feeling fueled yet light throughout your day! Our menu items will be packed with all the necessary components of a well balanced meal-- carbs, fiber, protein, fiber, protein, healthy fats, essential vitamins, and of course...LOTS of flavor! </p>

Our Story
Fit. Fun. Fresh. Fuel. 


Nicole and Justine

Our names are Justine and Nicole, and we met six months ago at the beginning of a 200 hour yoga teacher training. 
Prior to teacher training, Justine did a three day fruit fast as part of a 40 day wellness workshop held by HotBox Yoga Studio in Manayunk. After the fast she experimented with giving up meat while continuing to train for a marathon. She completed that marathon in November on a plant based diet and felt light and energized.
Nicole grew up in rural Lancaster County where fresh, organic food was both affordable and abundant. When she left for college at Temple University these options were no longer available to her and she became interested in the relationship between food and well being of the physical body. Over the past several years she has visited Jamaica, lived in Thailand, traveled the US Midwest, paid Canada a visit, and embarked on a two and a half week tour of Europe with her two college roommates. Her travels showed her that people around the world generally eat much less and more fresh produce. Nicole believes that no matter the diet subscription, plant based foods are especially exceptional at naturally healing, balancing, and maintaining biochemical responses in our bodies to prevent disease, leading to a happier, healthier life. 

Nearing the end of our training, we began to realize that we both wanted to be of service to our communities and that our current jobs were not manifesting this purpose. On February 7, 2015, in a tiny coffee shop in Manayunk, the Happy Hippy Food Truck was born, and it is scheduled to open August of 2015 on Temple University's Campus.

Hi. We are Cowtown Restaurant (Aroun (Ronnie)

We've been making the best burgers and breakfasts in town for the
past 3 years at Cowtown Farmers Market. In
2014 we were named one of the best place to have breakfast in South Jersey by
The New Jersey Journal.  We’ve loved
every minute of that time, but we're ready to take our restaurant concept to the general public on the main road!! We're
raising funds to open the next great restaurant: an
incredible:
American,Thai and Southeast Asian fusion.  It’s about time we have a restaurant to
satisfy the ever changing, growing and adventurous favors pallet of this
community.  
Don’t worry WE ARE NOT
LEAVING COWTOWN FARMER MARKET. We will still be open for market days and the
rodeo season Saturdays night. As long as the Wonderful Awesome Harris family
will still have us. WE LOVE THEM!!! We have big plans for our little business,
but to get there we need your help. We don't want to finance our new restaurant

The Impact
 
Our current location is very well known for market days but we do not have road frontage to attract our potential customers. There is
a great opportunity for us to grab the brass ring and fill one of this community's culinary voids.
Where will this money go? We will use our Indiegogo funds
to build the kitchen, permits and signage. We already have everything else ready to go.  We have dining room furnishings, menus done and decors.     Risks & Challenges  
In the restaurant business 1 in 4 restaurants close or change
