CHARLES GOULD (Carmine) is a comedian who lives in the Big Apple. Apparently he's
starved for attention. If you recognize him, he hopes
it's because he's appeared on MTV (as a nerd), College Humor (as
a nerd) and Law and Order (as a nerd blogger) but more likely it's
probably because he looks like that kid you went to summer camp with
named Ethan. Charles was named a
2015 ""Comic to Watch"" by Comedy Central and performed as a
finalist in the New York's Funniest as part of the New York Comedy
Festival. If you're the best looking
person in your family or group of friends, then you won't find him funny. His YouTube videos include the hysterical, Puss,
about two desperate Millenials who dress like cats to get jobs; Red Flags
(why you shouldn’t date him); and East Village Haikus (for
all the drunk girls).",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div> Sara Kozlowska - Graduate of Ballet School of Feliks Parnell in Lodz (Poland), where I started my adventure with dance. During those studies I took part in many performances that were played in Grand Theatre, Musical Theater and in  Philharmonic in Lodz. Later on I began dancing in V6 Theatre in Lodz. I developed  many different dance techniques along with acrobatics. In 2012 I joined KIJO Group, where I constantly improve my skills in contemporary and physical dance, improvisation, contact improvisation and participate in group activities. In dance I am fascinated in physicality, strengh and endurance of the human body. Since 2014 I study choreography and dance techniques on Music Academy of Kiejstut and Grazyna Bacewicz in Lodz.</div>

In October last year I went to Berlin, where was the audition to ""Dance Journey"" which is organized by the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company in Israel. It worked and I received an invitation. So my adventure began! :)  







What is the ""Dance Journey""?





The Dance Journey program is a unique  program hosted by Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company (KCDC), one of the world's leading contemporary dance companies. The program includes repertoire lessons as well as ballet, modern, contemporary and pilates classes. Dance Journey dancers also have the opportunity to take part in 'Nitzotzot' where they are given the opportunity, time and space to create an original choreographic work.

 Participation in this program is very important for me, becouse as a young, maturing dancer I would like to experience, gain knowledge and develop my skills. 
Taking part in the program is an incredible chance to confront my knowledge of dance with what other people know about it.

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<p>This is a free public performance.  We're self-producing in a public park because we believe in creating demand for art through exposure and participation.   But at the same time, we all know that art is never free.  It costs a lot of time, money and creative output to produce this kind of work.  We need your help to make it happen.  Your contribution to our IndieGoGo campaign will fund:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stipends ($3250).  We have hired some highly trained, super-skilled artists for this project, and they've generously agreed to share their talents for modest stipends because they love the work.  Help us pay our 9 luminous performers, 3 incredible designers, and our ridiculously creative production manager.  </p></li>
<li><p>Costumes ($750).  Our Hungry Ghosts may resort to desperate measures to get at your stories...but they draw the line at performing naked.  Help us put them in conceptually rad, movement-friendly costumes.</p></li>
<li><p>The Cards ($250). It’s hard to play a card game without cards. We have a gorgeous deck of oversized cards designed by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/adamwile/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Wile </a>that we need to print and mount.  <i>(P.S. you can get copies of some of these beautiful cards as a perk for supporting this campaign!)</i></p></li>
<li><p>Web App ($150).  <i>Ghost Card</i> happens online as much as it does in person.  Our website needs hosting, and our awesome online story-collection gizmo actually comes with a subscription cost.  <i> (Check out the website and feed us a story.  Already done it?  <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/1758787/www.ghostcardshow.com/feed-us-your-story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Feed us another!</a>  We're insatiably hungry...)</i></p></li>
<li><p>Scenic Design ($300). Ghost Card will premiere at <i>Two Too-Large Tables, </i>but then it's going on the road.  In order to bring the work to public sites across the city and beyond, we need to buy the materials to create an abstracted, elegant, and easily portable scenic design that emulates the concept and quality of the Wexlers' original.</p></li>
<li><p>Crowd Control Ushers ($300).  We are performing in a nontraditional space at Hudson River Park, filled with passersby, park service vehicles and a busy bike path.   We need to hire crowd-control ushers for each performance to guide the audience toward safe areas.</p></li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>In thanks for your support, we have a fantastic selection of perks.   Shout-outs both virtual and literal, fireworks lit in your honor, a one-page theatrical ode by a FullStop playwright starring YOU,  custom playing cards featuring the designs of the show, dance lessons, a private wine reception with the creative team, a mighty creative services package and a limited-edition artist-signed proof by Allan Wexler...plus special SECRET PERKS that will be revealed throughout the campaign.  <i>(Follow us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ghostcardshow/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and our <a href=""http://ghostcardshow.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a> for the inside scoop on secret perks!)</i></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We all know how socially and spiritually isolating life in American society can be sometimes.  And we all know how rich our culture is with artists whose work is rendered invisible to the public because of economic and social barriers.  This project breaks down both of those realities with a free public offering that uses the community’s own stories as the primary narrative substance.  We believe that by reflecting the myriad inner worlds of a neighborhood’s members back to itself through performance, we can begin to dissolve some of the perceived and actual barriers that divide communities of strangers.</span></p>
<p>The piece is designed to be portable, reproducible, and neighborhood-specific, situated in public parks that are regular visiting points for locals, and comprised of stories supplied by the members of the surrounding community.  We hope to eventually present <i>Ghost Card </i>in public spaces all over New York City, and beyond!</p>

<p>At our core, we are a group of creative friends that set out on a goal: to produce a unique piece of indie theater all on our own! I am very proud to say that we're well on our way to that goal with our production of <i>Old Haunts</i>, an original play by Emily Simon.  Emily has written a wonderful coming-of-age story about a  college student,  Mark Robbins, who returns back to his hometown of Boulder, Colorado after a semester spent away at Columbia University. Upon his return, Mark finds himself brutally confronted by the relationships he left wearily behind, and haunted by the uncertainty of what his future holds. Told through non-linear plot lines and vivid glimpses into Mark's spiraling imagination, <i>Old Haunts</i> provides an adventurous and unyielding take on what it's like to revisit your old stomping ground. </p>
<p>While this project was born of sheer optimism and unrivaled passion, there remained a shred of fear that perhaps no one else would be interested in what we had to offer. After all, we were solving tech problems with duct tape and bailing wire. Making costumes out of old socks and tablecloths. Staging rehearsals in our living rooms. Resources were scarce, but our spirits remained high. And we are elated to say that The New York International Fringe Festival believed in our project as much as we do! We have the incredible opportunity to bring <i>Old Haunts </i>to life this August with one of New York's most exciting and prestigious festivals for indie-theater! </p>
<p>Now it's time to get started! The cast has been chosen, the crew established, and the venue set! All we need now is your help! And LOTS of work!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With any theater project, there are a lot of expenses. And while scarcity breeds creativity (we hope), certain costs simply cannot be avoided without sacrificing the fidelity of the show or mistreating the wonderful people of the cast and crew.</p>
<p><b>Rehearsal Space</b>: This is the largest expense we face in doing this project! <i>Old Haunts</i> has a number of complex dance numbers and intricately choreographed scenes that require large studio spaces to create. The cost of studio space in Manhattan for the remainder of our rehearsal period is $2500.00.</p>
<p><b>Props &amp; Costumes</b>: The name of the game for our Fringe NYC production is <i>simplification</i>!  However, certain major costume pieces need to be designed and created which entails hiring a little help from a friend in the costume design business. In addition, props help us fully enter into the warped world of Mark's imagination, and over time, the cost adds up. <br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Furthermore, to be compliant with Fringe NYC requirements, we must make some adjustments to certain props- in particular stage cigarettes and lighters.  We estimate the total cost of the costumes and props to be $1,000.00</span></p>
<p><b>Cargo Van</b>: Another expense we will incur for the Fringe NYC production is the rental of a cargo van.  We will be staging a number of performances of 'Old Haunts' throughout the two week festival, and it is a requirement that we strike our set completely after each show.  That means we're carrying the entire set of our show with us. Therefore, we need to rent a cargo van to house these items for the duration of the festival to keep them readily available for each of our performances. The cost of the cargo van rental is $500.00.</p>
<p><b>Insurance</b>:  We must purchase accident/injury insurance for our cast and crew for our Fringe NYC production.  The cost of this insurance is $300.00.</p>
<p><b>Compensation</b>:  We estimate the compensation for the cast and crew to be $2,000.00.</p>
<p><b>Printing</b>:  The estimated cost of printing our Playbills is $100.00</p>
<p><b>Incidentals</b>:  Every production is met with last minute incidental expenses.  We anticipate our production to be no different.  We're hoping to set aside an additional $400.00 to cover any incidental expenses as they occur.  </p>
<p>Customary Radicals is a fledgling production company with modest means. However, we would like to show our appreciation for any donation you can make. Please check out the 'Perks' section for a list of ways we can give some love back!</p>
<p>In the event we are not able to raise enough funds to fully cover our expenses, any monies raised will go first toward the cost of the insurance for our cast and crew and then toward the rehearsal space as these are our primary concerns.</p>
<p>In the event we surpass our goal, all extra funds will go toward future Customary Radicals productions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Your contribution will allow our production to be manifested at its fullest potential.  <i>Old Haunts</i> is a play with a huge heart and a strong message. With your help, it can be a voice for thousands of people who have experienced similar hardships and heartbreaks. It can be a rally cry for those who could never find the words. It can be a home for those who thought they were alone. </div>
<div>I can't emphasize enough the amount of love and passion that Customary Radicals has brought to this production. It is because we have a message that we believe in. And we want to share our story with you.  </div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Our biggest challenge is actually our biggest achievement.  We are a brand new production company of young artists with vision.  <i>Old Haunts</i> is our very first project and we were immediately recognized by Fringe NYC for our potential.  We are honored and thrilled by this opportunity.  However, because we are just taking our first baby steps as a company, and this is our very first project, we have not had the time to generate the revenue needed to catapult us to the mainstage opportunity Fringe NYC is providing for us.  </div>

<h3>The Company</h3>
<p>cold.dead.fish is a new independent theatre company comprised of Jessica Peverett and Kyle Lewis. To find out a little bit about us as individuals check out our bios below. Together, we're interested in creating visually stimulating, emotionally challenging, intellectually engaging theatre. Right now we're working on <i>The Miranda Project</i>, a brand new play that will be premiering at the 2011 Edmonton International Fringe Festival. Though we've worked together before, this is the first official project as cold.dead.fish. We can't wait to share it with you. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Here's a little bit about the show!</b></p>
<p>Miranda's been locked in the cellar. She finds a light bulb, a bath tub and a stack of books that multiply. Days bleed into weeks and weeks seem like days. She waits patiently. She waits obediently. But when do you give up waiting for love? <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Here's a little bit about us! </b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Kyle Lewis: </b>I've been directing for the past 15 years but if I had to label myself I'd be lost. I've got an MFA in directing from Arizona State University and I am a member of Actors' Equity Association, but I've done a little bit of everything including acting, designing and construction. To date I have at least 100 productions under my belt...but none have engaged me like this one. Whether you attend this production or give your online support (maybe even both?) I guarantee that you will be participating in an incredible theatrical event. And my favorite dessert is Guinness. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Jessica Peverett: </b>I've done all kinds of gigs but primarily I'm an actor, director, playwright and dramaturge based in Edmonton. I just recently graduated from the University of Alberta's Master of Arts program where I spent two years living and breathing theatre. Academia all day and then rehearsals / working at a local theatre at night. This spring, my script Pushed was produced by the Nextfest Arts Company. The production received rave reviews from CBC and Vue Weekly (5 stars) and has been tentatively slated for production again next winter. This will be the first time that I perform something that I've written and I'm so excited to share that with you. And my favorite thing in the world is an iced coffee beverage. </p>

<h3>Why is the Edmonton Fringe Festival so amazing?</h3>
<div>The Edmonton Fringe is the second largest Fringe festival in the world where 41 venues house over 1500 performances. Last year over 192,000 tickets were sold and they estimate that nearly half a million people came out to visit the Fringe site. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The Edmonton Fringe is unique because it runs on a lottery system. So that means, in October of 2010, we submitted an application for a spot in one of those 41 venues and then names were picked from a jar. Literally! A Jar! We were lucky enough to be selected and we've been working on the piece ever since.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you help out <i>The Miranda Project</i>?</h3>
<p>The Edmonton Fringe is a fabulous tool for independent artists to get out and produce new works. But with a great opportunity comes some financial snags. We're responsible for paying all the bills. To apply for the festival, companies are required to pay $635.00 CAD. This gets us a venue, a professional technician, ticket services and very limited promotion. From there, we have to pay for our set, our costumes, our props, our rehearsal space and the rest of our marketing materials (posters, handbills, etc). All this has to be paid off before we can think about paying our actors. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It's really important to us that we be able to compensate the people who throw themselves into this project and there are no guarantees at Fringe!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So here's what we're trying to subsidize before we get to the festival:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1. The $635.00 application fee<br/></p>
<p>2. $100 for promotional materials (if no one knows about our shows, then we certainly won't make any money through ticket sales!)</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The VILLAGE PLAYWRIGHTS was founded out of the need of Lesbian and Gay writers to have a venue in which they could present their works without fear of being harshly criticized or dismissed because of their sexual orientation or gender identification.   The VILLAGE PLAYWRIGHTS meet at the LGBT Center in New York on the 2nd and 4th Wednesdays of each month and welcome all Playwrights, Screenwriters, Directors and Actors to participate in their programs.  The VILLAGE PLAYWRIGHTS take pride in critiquing works solely on their merit and not on their sometimes sensitive subject matter. This allows each writer to find his or her voice as a creative individual.  To speak freely is to be empowered. <br/></p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Do<br/>
</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Twice a month we hold readings of plays. We help with the casting of plays and the readings are followed by a critique of the works by the<span>  </span>writers’ peers which is an invaluable aid for the writer.

Some writers choose to have their works read as they are working on them, scene by scene; others prefer to hear their works read when they are completed.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Three times a year we sponsor An Evening of Short Plays in a theater that we rent in order to give the writers the further opportunity of participating in the production of their plays that have been workshopped at our meetings.  <span style=""font-family: Times; font-size: 12pt;""> Putting a play before an audience is the best method for learning how to write well.</span> </p>

<p><strong>Engel the Elder's BARD, BEAT$ &amp; BURLESQUE </strong>premiers at the <em>2013 Santa Cruz Fringe Festival </em>on Saturday, July 13 (3:30 p.m.); Thursday, July 18 (7:30 p.m.); Friday, July 19 (10:00 p.m.) and Saturday, July 20 (2:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.) at the Tannery Dance and World Culture Center.

<p>Engel the Elder is my alter ego--and we two have been building up to this show/performance-piece for several years. Engel means ""angel"" in German, and his development began when I lived in New York and met an elderly and wise character actor who mentored me and became my angel.</p>
<p>Since 2009, I've appeared as Engel annually at <em>The Carolina Renaissance Festival </em>where I've performed magic, swallowed fire, and recited from Shakespeare, often with Bathos the Muse (the stage name of guitarist Eddie Jeff Cahill), for the thousands of people visiting Fairhaven Village each October &amp; November. I've been nominated twice by the <em>Metrolina Theater Association (Charlotte Metro Area)</em> for appearing as Engel in the part of ""Henry, The Old Actor"" in two separate productions of <em>The Fantasticks </em>and, in the same role, I won Best Character Actor from the Uwharrie Players for their 2012 production of <em>The Fantasticks</em>.</p>
<p>I've written and had published award-winning stories, poems and plays; recorded spoken and musical CDs; appeared in films and on radio and tv--all as Engel the Elder (aka Engel Meister). I've also created signature images of Shakespeare using the name <em>Shaxpere. </em>Last year, on a shoestring budget, I brought my first Engel the Elder show, <em>Engel the Elder's SHAXPERE AFTER MIDNIGHT<strong>, </strong></em>to the <em>2012 Santa Cruz Fringe.</em></p>
<p>To improve and professionally produce the Santa Cruz show, I humbly ask for your participation in funding this production.  Of course, as my ""angels,"" you will not only be contributing to this production, but to the continued development and success of Engel, and what I hope will become a well-loved and well-known character. And, of course, you will receive the really cool perks described to the right.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The goal is to raise at least $600--which is only 40% of the production costs for the <em>2013 Santa Cruz Fringe.</em> The show is a 50-minute salute to everything Shakespeare. The main challenge of putting up this show is raising the money for things like transportation, advertising, props and crew. The next biggest challenge is getting the word out so that people buy tickets and come to the show. Your support of this project will help make this and future show possible!</p>
<p>I thank you for taking your time to consider this project. Any level of help is greatly appreciated. If you can be in Santa Cruz on the performance dates, I hope I'll see you there.  And if you can't be at these performances, I look forward to performing for you soon.</p>

She adds feminist perspective, gay pride, biting commentary… and lots of sequins and sass.” –nytheatre.comNurses in New England“I saw this show last week and it was so great - and I don't know if you saw it? Nurses of New England? It was by that Half Straddle company. It was WONDERFUL. Totally, geniusly ridiculous, with song numbers and a live band and an amazing but simple set. … It was perfectly executed and ultra precise, and the perfs were so good – it was one of those shows where you can just relax because you know no one's trying to pull anything over on you. None of them gives a flying f, yet they've worked really hard and have still managed to not give a flying f.” – Sibyl KempsonFAMILY• Named a Top 10 Show of 2009 by Time Out New York• “Ridiculous and enchanting musical Family... full to the brim with killer talent.”—Helen Shaw, TIME OUT NEW YORK• “Family re-invents downtown experimental theater for the new millennium—and has atremendous lot of fun doing it.”—Heather J. Violanti, NYTHEATRE.COMThe Knockout Blow• “Satter pair babes in off-the-shoulder lamé with winky, wistful dialogue and sets it all to Chris Giarmo’s synthesizer-mad, '80s-esque avant-ballads. A well-put-together production, I almost felt, would have ruined the girls-playing-dress-up vibe.”—Helen Shaw, TIME OUT NEW YORK• “That Eskimo, werewolf and backup dancer know how to knock those songs out of the park”—George Hunka, SUPERFLUITIES REDUX",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>You've found us!</h3>
<p>We are Tremor Theatre Collective. We are a group of performing artists with the common belief in theatre as a space apart, a sublime meeting place where we can all break with reality, and become aware of the simplest iterations of humanity. By extracting those essential moments, those actions and behaviors that reveal us to be human, we weave together new stories, new rules, new realities. We want to take on the challenge it is to create a truly transcendent theatrical experience. Check us out in more detail here: tremorcollective.tumblr.com</p>

<h3>Something's afoot...</h3>
<p>A play! An experience! An adventure! Our inaugural production as a collective will be THE RUB, a site-specific original work, conceived and directed by Nessa Norich, an alumna of Barnard College's theatre program and Jacques Lecoq International School of Theatre. Using Shakespeare's Hamlet as a point of departure, THE RUB is a surreal and playful investigation of the frustration, anxiety, passion, complacency, self-doubt, delusion, isolation and desire that come with being heirs to a state rotting from the inside out. Hamlet's in the thick of it, we're in the thick of it, you're in the thick of it--we're all freaking out about it, so let's do it together!</p>
<p>THE RUB will take place in the sprawling Magic Future Box, a warehouse off the beaten path, in Brooklyn, NY. We promise you this will be a unique diversion!</p>

(only $35 and $47), and our audience size is 400 seats.
For
this performance ”On Pointe at 50, and beyond!..., we've already raised a part of the funds. We need your help and your support to cover the rest of the production expenses, including
scenery, wardrobe, props, studio & theater rentals and performers & choreographer's fees.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>William Shakespeare once wrote  ""All the World's a Stage"" and no other passage can better describe the history and philosophy of the Hudson Shakespeare Company. Since 1992, the company has produced a wide range of titles from the Bard to Modern theater (now over 100 productions and counting) in a variety of outdoor and indoor venues.  From city parks to courtrooms, our mission has always been a simple one - to give our audience the best theatrical experience possible. For 22 years HSC has been serving the public arts community by providing free productions in various venues throughout Northern New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut.  We love performing for these communities and plan to continue to do so.  This fall, we are planning to go beyond our normal summer season and produce TWO shows - one for our annual school tour, an all-female AS YOU LIKE IT and Shakespeare's great slasher play, TITUS ANDRONICUS.  Normally, our funds can take care of us, but this time we are seeking for a bit of help.  Our normal rehearsal space is not available to us, and we would prefer to keep to our actors healthy and happy for our performances by not asking them to rehearse outside in the park as the weather gets cooler. Rehearsal space is expensive, and we need some help in acquiring these spaces for the remainder of the rehearsal period which runs through the end of October.  We can't express hiow much just a little extra cash would help us out.  It will keep everyone safe, happy, and healthy for the rigors the performing requires.  We want to provide an inviting atmosphere for our actors to work in.  </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Rehearsal space!  We are seeking some extra funds to help us out with this.  Each room in Manhattan costs at minimum 20$ an hour (so minimum 60$ a night) so anything you can give will help.  </p>
<p>In return we have some awesome offerings - everything from a signed program from the cast, a reserved front row seat at one of our shows,  or a personal monologue audition session!  </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>As part of this production, we are performing in the Harismus Cemetary in Jersey City.  This historic site is run by valueable volunteers who are trying to perserve the city's history.  It's such a fantastic site for this great play.  By helping us, you will be helping them.  If we are able to bring this awesome show to them, we can bring money to their site to keep it preserved.  Your donating is seriously appreciated.  </li>
<li>We are one of the few non-union theatre companies still in exsistence.  Started in 1992 by our founder, L. Robert Johnson (effectionately known as ""Luther"") who's goal it was to bring outdoor theatre across the Hudson, we strive on to continue to bring these works of the Bard with very little, yet still bring New Jersey and the tri-state area the best talent and productions we can.  It all comes from a love of what we do, and of a love of the work.  We want to continue to grow as artists, as people, and as contributors to the community.  </li>
<li>Please help us help our community and to keep the work of our business partner alive.  Luther started this and has touched many people and while we are aware that a lot of those who participate don't know who he is, or his impact on our lives, to those he did work with, he will never be forgotten and we will continue to forge on in this wonderful company he set up.  </li>

<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share this campaign with others!</li>
<li>Have a car?  You can also help us out by becoming a driver and helping our actors get from one venue to the next!</li>
<li>Have props?  Costumes?  You can donate them to us.</li>
<li>A special skill?  Do you stage manage or love to do sound design?  We'd love to have you.  We're getting more inventive, so please, if you have skills and tricks and tools of the trade to share, let us know! </li>

Robert Johnson (effectionately known as ""Luther"") who's goal it was to bring outdoor theatre across the Hudson, we strive on to continue to bring these works of the Bard with very little, yet still bring New Jersey and the tri-state area the best talent and productions we can.  It all comes from a love of what we do, and of a love of the work.  We want to continue to grow as artists, as people, and as contributors to the community.  
Please help us help our community and to keep the work of our business partner alive.  Luther started this and has touched many people and while we are aware that a lot of those who participate don't know who he is, or his impact on our lives, to those he did work with, he will never be forgotten and we will continue to forge on in this wonderful company he set up.

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Hey there!
How’s it goin’? We’re Elizabeth and Taylor (yes, just like the actress!) and we’re producing a new play, (un)real, with Reckless Theatre Group.

What’s (un)real about?
Family. Fiction. Freefall. 
Desperately alone after her mother’s untimely death, Catherine is forced to navigate her fractured family history and discover how to claim her own future. Is Catherine toeing the edge of reality’s cliff or has she already plunged into the crisp waters of a narrative that is (un)real?  
(un)real began development in fall of 2012 at NYU. After a successful thesis reading earlier this year at Theatre for the New City, the play will premiere December 4th - 8th, 2013.

Who are you anyway?
Reckless was started in 2009 by Producing Artistic Director Taylor Haven Holt, and we have produced three successful mainstage productions - Stupid Kids (UNDER St. Marks), A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Kraine Theatre) and Dog Sees God (UNDER St. Marks), as well as numerous readings and cabarets. We’re proud to have used the talents of over 33 actors in the last 4 years, as well as many designers, stage managers, and videographers.
The motivation of Reckless Theatre Group is to develop theatrical projects utilizing and engaging an emerging generation of artists. In doing so we hope to provide a voice for a present and future generation of issue-oriented introspective theatre-goers. 
In 2013, Reckless produced Shel’s Shorts - a weekend of short pieces by the brilliant Shel Silverstein - at Jimmy’s No. 43, as well as two developmental readings of (un)real.

Brilliant. Who’s working on (un)real?
We’ve put together a crazy amazing team of artists!

the CAST.
Andrea Lynn Green* as Catherine
Matthew McShane as Phillip
Charlie Gorrilla as Gabe
and
Emily Mikesell* as Moira

So, what’s up?
Producing in NYC is not an easy feat. We are thrilled to have booked an amazing and historic theater in the East Village - the Gene Frankel Theater. But it takes a lot of resources to make this production come to life.
That’s where you come in!

How can I get involved?
We are ecstatic to be presenting the premiere of (un)real, and showcasing the talents of our team of artists. In order to make this production a reality we must raise $5,000. The money all goes toward:
- rental of the Gene Frankel Theatre
- actor and designer stipends
- set materials (to transport you to a genuine Greenpoint studio apartment)
- props
- lighting equipment rentals
- transportation of materials and equipment
- marketing and printing costs (postcards, posters, playbills)

That sounds great! But... what do I get in return?
For your generous contributions, you become a member of the Reckless community, and receive a number of different benefits, depending on your level of support. Donors will receive perks such as online (and playbill) shout outs, cast-signed Brooklyn postcards, free beer and wine, and even above-the-title Producing credit.

A través del riesgo, la pasión y la calidad de nuestras propuestas, buscamos incidir en la transformación de nuestra realidad socio-política y cultural mediante el contacto con el público y nuestro medio artístico.</p>
<p>Teniendo en cuenta las acciones que ha tomado el estado en los últimos años y la coyuntura social actual, hemos decidido sumar esfuerzos para mostrar una historia que nos permita ver de cerca lo que está en juego cada vez que ignoramos los derechos básicos de las personas trans que viven en nuestra sociedad. Esta pieza busca ayudarnos a medir la distancia que hay entre nuestro punto de partida como profesionales y ciudadanos y el de las mujeres y hombres trans que también llaman a esta ciudad su hogar. </p>
<p>Creemos y apostamos en que el teatro es una plataforma idónea para mostrar otras realidades y el impacto que tienen nuestras acciones sobre las vidas de los demás.  Somos conscientes de la necesidad de visibilizar a aquellxs personas que no están siendo tomadas en cuenta por la sociedad y el Estado; lo que no se ve se le teme, se le aleja, se le rechaza... Cada unx puede apoyar desde su trinchera, desde aquel lugar que se desarrolla mejor, y en nuestro caso es en el teatro: en puestas en escenas de calidad, con contenido sincero y real.</p>

<h3>EL IMPACTO</h3>
<p>Apostamos por conversar, discutir y educar. Creemos que generar espacios donde se discuta situaciones delicadas es un deber social con el fin de vivir en comunidad de manera más justa para todxs. Poner en escena a un personaje trans VISIBILIZA a una población que normalmente no tiene un espacio en las tablas. Lo que invita a la conversación a toda aquella persona que sea parte del público, ya sea con un conversatorio con personas cercanas al temas o a la salida del teatro con su acompañante, el impacto esta ahí: en romper el tabú.</p>
<p>Es justamente esa acción de romper el tabú la que, poco a poco, va acabando con los prejuicios y discriminación... Si nos empezamos a ver de verdad, reconociendo nuestras semajanzas por sobre nuestras diferencias es cuando vamos a crear una sociedad más justa para todxs. </p>

A través del riesgo, la pasión y la calidad de nuestras propuestas, buscamos incidir en la transformación de nuestra realidad socio-política y cultural mediante el contacto con el público y nuestro medio artístico.
Teniendo en cuenta las acciones que ha tomado el estado en los últimos años y la coyuntura social actual, hemos decidido sumar esfuerzos para mostrar una historia que nos permita ver de cerca lo que está en juego cada vez que ignoramos los derechos básicos de las personas trans que viven en nuestra sociedad. Esta pieza busca ayudarnos a medir la distancia que hay entre nuestro punto de partida como profesionales y ciudadanos y el de las mujeres y hombres trans que también llaman a esta ciudad su hogar. 
Creemos y apostamos en que el teatro es una plataforma idónea para mostrar otras realidades y el impacto que tienen nuestras acciones sobre las vidas de los demás.  Somos conscientes de la necesidad de visibilizar a aquellxs personas que no están siendo tomadas en cuenta por la sociedad y el Estado; lo que no se ve se le teme, se le aleja, se le rechaza... Cada unx puede apoyar desde su trinchera, desde aquel lugar que se desarrolla mejor, y en nuestro caso es en el teatro: en puestas en escenas de calidad, con contenido sincero y real.

<p>We are <a href=""http://www.inlakechdance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>In Lak’ech Dance Academy</i></a>, the only queer, trans and allied salsa and bachata dance company in the U.S., directed by Jahaira Fajardo and Angelica Medina. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521760758/p0h0ayxnooiqop8hqo98.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are proud to produce the first <a href=""http://www.queerlatindancefestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Queer Latin Dance Festival</a> in Oakland, California June 8th – 9th, 2018.</p>
<p>The money that we raise in this campaign will help us to produce this festival and will also support scholarships for queer and trans dancers who would otherwise not be able to afford to attend.  </p>
<p>Our dance company is committed to creating a dance community that affirms all genders and sexualities. We do this because leading and following have nothing to do with gender. We also believe that dance can help us heal from the many traumas that we experience in our lives as queer and trans people.</p>
<p>The Queer Latin Dance Festival will be an embodiment of our values as a company and will reflect the diversity of our communities.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $6000 to produce this festival and to provide scholarships to queer and trans people of color. We’re doing everything we can to keep registration costs down because we want this to be as accessible as possible. But we aren’t skimping on the talent! We are hosting professional and award winning instructors, as well as musical guest Andre Veloz, an amazing female bachata singer, and her band.</p>

We will be printing hand fans and t-shirts with “salserx” and “bachaterx” to help you look hot and stay cool on the dance floor.

Hip hop and breakdance were my first areas of interest in this art form. The first success I had was when I was 15. My mom pushed me to enter a local talent contest called Spotlight to stardom.

Their goal each time they dance is to incorporate inspiration, intention and intelligence. Not only did they achieve that very clearly but they also shared a bond for fellow dancers that was nothing short of awesome! After talking with Jessica, she told me that I should audition for her summer program called ""The Muse Experience"". It is a program that shows you the ins and outs of being a professional dancer in L.A.  and a year later, I did just that! The audition required a video of me answering questions and performing a solo. I got my video in just in time and was accepted to be a part of The Muse Experience 2014!! (The video of my audition is on my page) That was the first step toward the opportunity of a lifetime! The next step, raising 3200 dollars to take a life changing adventure to Los Angeles, California! The money would cover funds to pay for the experience, plane expenses, and food. Whatever money I raise will go towards my fees even if I do not reach my goal. The list of new experiences this provides for me outside of dance includes, first time going to California, first time traveling by plane, and possibly going to a beach for the first time!

<h3>Help us save the GameVerse!</h3>
<p>The DC Stunt Coalition (DCSC) has performed the live stunt show at MAGFest for the past 2 years and we are now far into our prep for year three! This year's chapter: ""Guardians of the Grimdark"" - an action packed adventure starring are stunt performers as creatively costumed video game heroes, anti-heroes, and villains from across your favorite gaming fandoms!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482198281/s3sygzqsmusngluxiujy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since August 2016, we have been hard at work writing another fully original parody show. We are well on our way in producing another exciting and hilarious adventure for our audience to enjoy. With our creative team developing the script and the cast perfecting their fights and learning lines, we  believe you are all in for another extraordinary show.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478842228/rfot3prerr3lsaqrrscx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It is our hope to not only create a fun show for us, but a memorable one for you!</p>
<p>We need your help to show appreciation to this marvelous collection of talented stunt performers and action actors as they fight one another to determine the fate of the GameVerse. With your contributions, we can make the production value of this show; costumes, props, and effects, much greater than years before.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is being produced in an effort to support our cast. As parodies, these shows can't yield a profit, so we use them as educational exercises to give our performers a chance to create an amazing show and put it on MAGFest's incredible primetime stage. With that opportunity though, comes a huge investment on the part of the cast and crew in costumes and props.</p>
<p>So we need your help! We would like to give you, the audience, a chance to help us create this amazing hour of entertainment, all to insure our excitement and inspiration when producing future shows. Your contributions are a direct investment into our ability to create entertaining art!</p>
<p>This year, we'll be pulling out all the stops, as our costumes and props inspired by games and characters such as: Fallout’s Vault Dweller, Mass Effect’s Commander Shepard, Protoman, Bowser, LoL's Katarina, Kirby, Overwatch's Mercy, the Prince of Persia, Kingdom Hearts’ Sora and Heartless, and more characters soon to be announced!</p>
<p>It's a huge show, but we've learned how to crunch our numbers, and create a sustainable budget - so we don't need much! We are aiming to raise just $500 in order to help our performers make exciting costumes, our prop masters to make spectacular props, and also to help us afford provisions for our cast such as extra food, water, and print supplies.</p>
<p>Perks include: Recognition in after-show credits, a month membership to DCSC, private training with a DCSC instructor, and even last year’s star prop the Giant Video Game Controller, signed by last year’s cast!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>DCSC’s ""Gamers Against the Grimdark"" shows at MAGFest are fully volunteer productions. All costumes and props are assembled, created, or modified by the performers at their own personal cost in order to capture the spirit of their characters and the wonderment we all feel from videogaming to the best of their ability. Our performers pay out of their own pockets for the love of our fans, the love of performing, and most importantly, the love of video games. Your support will go a long way in alleviating the costs to our performers, as well as covering the cost of materials and props used in the show.</p>

<p>Beatrice is a wordless steam-punk puppet show, that deals with our human fascination and sometimes
symbiotic relationship with machines. </p>
<p>The performance is based on 'Beatrice', a
short story by Karin Tidbeck. The surreal and tragi-comic universe created by
the author constitutes an ideal setting to explore with puppetry.</p>
<p>It's a unique story about all-consuming passion
and its costs, set in a universe, where man and machine live together, fall in
love, procreate and hate in a way that is both bizarre and organic. The main characters are:  Franz Hiller, a doctor who falls deeply in love with the airship Beatrice. And Anna Goldberg, a printer's daughter, who has a hot romance with a steam
engine called Hercules. </p><p></p>
<p>This extraordinary and imaginative love-story is told in a steam-punk setting of
puppets, shadows, rotating mechanics, original sounds and music, and lots of
dark humor.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/464133/files/20140327072713-BeatricePuppetTheater_20140312_Rehearsels_12_Web.jpg?1395930433"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p> 
We are 5 theater professionals from
Denmark and UK, working together for the first time creating
'Beatrice': 1 director, 2 puppeteers, 1 composer,  and 1 puppet maker /
set designer. </p>
<p>'Beatrice' will be premiered at
Svanekegaarden in Denmark on the 6<sup>th</sup> of June 2014. We will take the production on a
premiere tour on Bornholm. We are also planning a Nordic tour in
September 2014. Following that we will start working on a world tour. </p>
<p>For further information and production peeks, please visit Beatrice on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/beatricedukketeater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a><br/></p>
<h3><b>Who we are:<br/></b></h3>
<p>Tidsrum is a non-profit company
based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Tidsrum makes art experiences focusing
on sensory, poetical and interactive expressions. 'Beatrice' is our first
puppet production. </p>

<h3><b>The Music:</b></h3><p><b>We tell the story with out words</b>, which is why the music is very important. Andreas Busk has not only composed a whole soundtrack for the show, but also invented 2 instruments.</p><p>The Bornholmer Violin is played live in the show. It is mainly used as the voice of Beatrice the airship. Watch here to hear Andreas test its sound:</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FWV4pUmRbKrk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWV4pUmRbKrk&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FWV4pUmRbKrk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>The Step Sequencer - made out of two turntables, is built into the set and is part of the universe the puppets live in. It will add sounds to the soundtrack according to the way the puppets operate it, and with a random factor that gives every show its own sound. <br/></p><h3><b>What we need the money for:</b></h3>
<p>We have been working on 'Beatrice'
since 2012. We've already invested lots of time, energy - and love - to get where we are now:
The puppets are almost finished, the set is working, the music is ready for the
final adjustments and the rehearsals are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we need YOUR help. We hope to raise $15,000 on indiegogo. The raised money will go to:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p>- One last rehearsal period <br/></p><p>- Costumes</p><p>- Lighting equipment</p><p>- Transport costs <br/></p><p>- Materials and workspace (to get the set
really gorgeously steam-punked)</p><p> - A short presentation movie about the show</p>
<p>We already have some funding for PR,
posters and marketing. Any funds above our goal will go to make international touring of
'Beatrice' possible, thus giving more people a chance to experience this
fantastic tale...</p><p>ANY donation will help!  - and all will go
into making the show. </p><p><br/></p><h3>What you get:</h3>
<p>First of all you get to be part of
making this great show real. You will have our sincerest gratitude and to show our appreciation of your generosity, we
will be offering some great perks, including: show tickets, invites to opening
night, mention in our programs and on our website, and even some original
art pieces.</p><p>- If you do NOT want your name on web, Facebook or program just send us a message.<br/></p>

Beatrice is a wordless steam-punk puppet show, that deals with our human fascination and sometimes
symbiotic relationship with machines. 
The performance is based on 'Beatrice', a
short story by Karin Tidbeck. The surreal and tragi-comic universe created by
the author constitutes an ideal setting to explore with puppetry.
It's a unique story about all-consuming passion
and its costs, set in a universe, where man and machine live together, fall in
love, procreate and hate in a way that is both bizarre and organic. The main characters are:  Franz Hiller, a doctor who falls deeply in love with the airship Beatrice. And Anna Goldberg, a printer's daughter, who has a hot romance with a steam
engine called Hercules. 
This extraordinary and imaginative love-story is told in a steam-punk setting of
puppets, shadows, rotating mechanics, original sounds and music, and lots of
dark humor. 
We are 5 theater professionals from
Denmark and UK, working together for the first time creating
'Beatrice': 1 director, 2 puppeteers, 1 composer,  and 1 puppet maker /
set designer. 
'Beatrice' will be premiered at
Svanekegaarden in Denmark on the 6th of June 2014. We will take the production on a
premiere tour on Bornholm. We are also planning a Nordic tour in
September 2014. Following that we will start working on a world tour. 
For further information and production peeks, please visit Beatrice on Facebook
Who we are:
Tidsrum is a non-profit company
based in Copenhagen, Denmark. Tidsrum makes art experiences focusing
on sensory, poetical and interactive expressions. 'Beatrice' is our first
puppet production. 
The dream team making the production 'Beatrice' come
true is: 
Director: Steve Tiplady
Puppeteers: Ida Marie Tjalve and Karina Nielsen
Puppets and Set design: Sarah Piyannah Cederstrand
Instrument creator and composer:
Andreas Busk
Author: Karin Tidbeck
The Music:We tell the story with out words, which is why the music is very important. Andreas Busk has not only composed a whole soundtrack for the show, but also invented 2 instruments.The Bornholmer Violin is played live in the show. It is mainly used as the voice of Beatrice the airship. Watch here to hear Andreas test its sound:The Step Sequencer - made out of two turntables, is built into the set and is part of the universe the puppets live in. It will add sounds to the soundtrack according to the way the puppets operate it, and with a random factor that gives every show its own sound. What we need the money for:
We have been working on 'Beatrice'
since 2012. We've already invested lots of time, energy - and love - to get where we are now:
The puppets are almost finished, the set is working, the music is ready for the
final adjustments and the rehearsals are running.

Now we need YOUR help. We hope to raise $15,000 on indiegogo. The raised money will go to:

- One last rehearsal period - Costumes- Lighting equipment- Transport costs - Materials and workspace (to get the set
really gorgeously steam-punked) - A short presentation movie about the show
We already have some funding for PR,
posters and marketing. Any funds above our goal will go to make international touring of
'Beatrice' possible, thus giving more people a chance to experience this
fantastic tale...ANY donation will help!  - and all will go
into making the show. What you get:
First of all you get to be part of
making this great show real. You will have our sincerest gratitude and to show our appreciation of your generosity, we
will be offering some great perks, including: show tickets, invites to opening
night, mention in our programs and on our website, and even some original
art pieces.- If you do NOT want your name on web, Facebook or program just send us a message.


Other Ways You Can Help:No amount
is too small (or too big!), but we understand that making a donation is 
not
possible for everyone. You can still be a huge help to us by simply 
spreading
the word about our campaign and sharing our video on Facebook and Twitter. And
check us out on Facebook ( in English) to learn more about the process of making 'Beatrice', or Tidsrum's website (in Danish) to learn about our company,

<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>The Ivy Crest Theatre Co., founded in 2015, was developed with the initiative to provide professional quality theatre at an affordable price to the NY audience in intimate black box settings. Our core imperative is that the plays we produce resonate with both our artists and audience. It is our commitment to achieve this mission through underproduced forms of theatre, such as one acts or short plays, new works and revivals of Off-Broadway plays. As an NYC theatre company, it is also our deeply held belief that our work should be as diverse as the city itself- providing a platform for women and minority writers but also to focus on works that range from blue to white collar struggles. As to the type of stories we want to tell, Faulkner said it best ""the problems of the human heart, in conflict with itself.""</p>

<p>There is no easy way to say this, so it's best to be direct. We need money. The actors and staff are volunteering on this project. With that said, we still need funds to secure a theatre and rehearsal space in midtown, pay a professional director, build a set and publicize the event. As of right now, we have put in as much money as we can on our own. To continue in finalizing this project and building a foundation for the theatre company- we need your help. </p>
<h3>Your Impact </h3>
<p>This project, and more specifically, this theatre company is about creating an opportunity. It’s about supporting a group of passionate artists, both new and professional, looking to take on works that strike a chord in them.  </p>
<p>Your impact, is the chance to give us the power to build a foundation so we can bring these works to life. Instead of searching for the right auditions, waiting by the phone for a call back or performing in unfulfilling projects, we want to get to work. It goes beyond just throwing a few extra bucks towards a project a friend is involved in. It’s the opportunity to give us a sustainable platform to continually create theatre on our own terms. You are crucial to our success. There is so much we want to say to you, but we’ll say the only thing worth saying...Thank you.</p>

What We Need
There is no easy way to say this, so it's best to be direct. We need money. The actors and staff are volunteering on this project. With that said, we still need funds to secure a theatre and rehearsal space in midtown, pay a professional director, build a set and publicize the event. As of right now, we have put in as much money as we can on our own. To continue in finalizing this project and building a foundation for the theatre company- we need your help. 
Your Impact 
This project, and more specifically, this theatre company is about creating an opportunity. It’s about supporting a group of passionate artists, both new and professional, looking to take on works that strike a chord in them.  
Your impact, is the chance to give us the power to build a foundation so we can bring these works to life. Instead of searching for the right auditions, waiting by the phone for a call back or performing in unfulfilling projects, we want to get to work. It goes beyond just throwing a few extra bucks towards a project a friend is involved in. It’s the opportunity to give us a sustainable platform to continually create theatre on our own terms. You are crucial to our success. There is so much we want to say to you, but we’ll say the only thing worth saying...Thank you.

<h4>What it's all about</h4>
<div>
<p>Hello and thank you for taking a look at this project. </p>
<p>You're probably wondering why there's a French flag on an apple. </p>
<p>The Necessity of Atheism by Sean Lang is a farce about the young poet Percy Shelley. Set during the height of the Napoleonic Wars (hence the flag), it sees Shelley distributing his new and rather controversial pamphlet asking for proof of God around the University of Oxford, attracting the attention of the less than sympathetic Lord Eldon. This is a boisterous comedy inspired by the exuberant cartoonists of the time. </p>
<p>But what about the apple I hear you ask? Well we don't want to give the game away but the apple is a key part of the hilarity of this play. </p>
<p></p>

<p>At the helm of this project is myself, the director, Sabrina Poole. I began directing in my first year of university with a 1920's adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 'The Importance of Being Earnest. Since then I have gone on to direct a variety of plays from Restoration Drama to new modern writing. 'The Necessity of Atheism' is a play very close to my heart. I played Shelley in the original all-female 2013 production which received a very positive response in Cambridge and Oxford, including multiple nominations in the Cambridge Drama Festival. This play was one of the best I have ever been part of and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to present it again. I have on board a team of enthusiastic and dedicated actors and a talented technician. For both them and myself this is a fantastic opportunity and we want to be able to make the most of it. Which is where you come in. </p>

Starshit est une pièce de théâtre co-écrite par Jonathan Caron et Julie Renault, deux comédiens et auteurs de la relève, qui sera présentée du 5 au 23 avril 2016 à la salle Jean-Claude Germain du Centre du Théâtre d’Aujourd’hui à Montréal MAIS AUSSI à l’automne 2017 à l’Agora des arts de Rouyn-Noranda et au Théâtre du Rift de Ville-Marie, en Abitibi-Témiscamingue.





SYNOPSIS


Bienvenue chez Starshit ! Une usine à café où l’on rencontre une faune d’employés – disciples et porte-étendards de l’entreprise – dont le seul fait de travailler pour cette corporation est en soi un privilège : une adhésion quasi totale, une famille reconstituée, un mode de vie, un amour du café exponentiel !


Texte fantaisiste où l’on fait la satire d’un dévouement corporatif total, Starshit est une critique de la société performante à travers des personnages qui ne sont pas de méchants financiers, mais de jeunes employés payés 10 $ l’heure.



ENTRE LES RÉGIONS ET LES GRANDS CENTRES


Starshit est une co-production du Théâtre du Tandem, établi depuis une vingtaine d’années e  Abitibi-Témiscamingue, et du Théâtre en Quec’Part qui vient tout juste de naître. C’est aussi un projet d’entraide où le relais se fait entre l’expérience et l’apprentissage du milieu artistique professionnel.


Le Théâtre du Tandem veut le porte-voix de l’imaginaire des artistes de l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue, ainsi qu’un espace de rencontre entre le milieu artistique régional et d’autres créateurs du Québec et du Canada.


Le Théâtre en Quec’Part s’assure de garder la relève vivante en région, et de la nomadiser afin qu’elle ne se rouille jamais dans l’acquis, tout en s’assurant de faire le même travail dans les grands centres. Elle axe ainsi la création vers la coopération et l’enrichissement mutuel.


 Ce dont nous avons besoin 

Nous avons l’appui du Tandem, du programme Jeunes Volontaires et de quelques autres partenaires financiers ainsi que trois soirées bénéfices derrière la cravate, mais il nous manque un dernier coup de pouce pour produire un spectacle de cette envergure. Chaque geste compte. Un 25$, un 50$ ou un 100$ contribue à payer:


-La salle du Centre du Théâtre d’aujourd’hui (15 soirs + entrée en salle)
-Les techniciens
-Le matériel de décor
-Les costumes
-Les éclairages
-Les artistes (Concepteurs, comédiens, metteur en scène, conseiller dramaturgique, …)
-Le matériel promotionnel (affiches, flyers, captations vidéos, … )
-Les frais de tournée et de ses préparatifs
-Ect!


Il ne manque que la dernière petite gorgée de café pour bien attaquer la première série de représentations et vous donner le meilleur des spectacles qui soit! Objectif de 7 000$ atteint ou pas, ces fonds seront judicieusement investis dans le projet.


Ce que vous obtenez
Donner à Starshit vous permet d'intégrer l'entreprise petit à petit pour peut-être devenir un célèbre barista habitant Starshit City! Pour vous remercier, la maison mère vous a préparer des petits cadeaux comme: 

10$ La reconnaissance éternelle de la compagnie et de son équipe
25$ Une photo personnalisé de l'équipe qui te remercie et la chanson thème de l'entreprise à mettre comme sonnerie ou réveil-matin

50$ Un ensemble de café gourmets à déguster afin de développer tes goûts
100$ Un tablier rouge à l'effigie de Starshit, pareil à un vrai barista de chez Starshit
300$ Une paire de billets pour aller voir le spectacle, accompagnée d'une visite VIP des coulisses du spectacle en compagnie de l'équipe Starshit
500$Une toile à thématique Café réalisé par nul autre que Jonathan Caron



L'impact

Contribuer au succès de Starshit, c’est permettre à de jeunes artistes de s’accomplir et de produire leur première création dans un théâtre institutionnel, entourés par des gens qui ont de l'expertise dans le domaine. Contribuer à la réussite de Starshit, c’est participer à un acte de rassemblement entre les régions du Québec et ses grands centres. Contribuer à Starshit, c’est aussi permettre la création d’un excellent spectacle auquel vous pourrez assister qui changera peut-être votre perception des choses.

incontro tra Macao e Workcenter risale allo scorso maggio durante il
Festival Folle Agire Urbano a Macao. Il Workcenter,
con la sezione guidata da Mario Biagini - l'Open Program, porta per la prima volta a
Milano un suo spettacolo. La musica, i movimenti, le voci del
Workcenter ci contaminano; il clima di quella serata, l’energia, la
vitalità e la delicatezza ci incantano. In luglio, dopo averci
invitato a Pontedera per vedere il loro lavoro, arriva a Macao anche
il team guidato da Thomas Richards. Nasce così,
attraverso reciproche ospitalità, un progetto comune: una residenza
del Workcenter a Macao, dal 3 al 12 ottobre 2014, con tre spettacoli (<a href=""http://www.macao.mi.it/workcenter/spip.php?article11&amp;lang=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Am America</a>, <a href=""http://www.macao.mi.it/workcenter/spip.php?article12&amp;lang=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electric Party Songs</a>, <a href=""http://www.macao.mi.it/workcenter/spip.php?article13&amp;lang=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Hydden Sayings</a>), un workshop (<a href=""http://www.macao.mi.it/workcenter/spip.php?article14&amp;lang=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Azione intenzionale e comportamento organico</a>), la proiezione di alcuni documentari (<a href=""http://www.macao.mi.it/workcenter/spip.php?article39&amp;lang=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Action in Aya Irini, Dies Iraæ: the Preposterous Theatrum Interioris Show</a>) e una <a href=""http://www.macao.mi.it/workcenter/spip.php?article15&amp;lang=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tavola rotonda</a> sul tema dell'incontro tra ricerca teatrale e politica.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Durante la
residenza abbiamo raccolto immagini, note, frammenti di lavoro e di vita. Vogliamo infatti che
questa esperienza possa confluire nella produzione di un libro con
testi originali di Ginsberg, interviste, appunti di lavoro, note,
foto e video scaricabili tramite QR-code. Un racconto corale per dare
voce a un’esperienza realmente condivisa, che non termina con la
fine dello spettacolo. E’ un progetto
ambizioso. Macao non ha finanziatori né produttori, e abbiamo
bisogno del tuo aiuto per realizzarlo.</span><br/></p>

volontà di Jerzy Grotowski, regista che ha tracciato linee
fondamentali nella ricerca teatrale del secondo novecento. Da uno dei
suoi storici spettacoli, “Apocalypsis cum figuris”, Ermanno Olmi
realizza nel 1979 un celebre documentario. Articolato in due team di
lavoro, il Focused Research Team in Art as Vehicle guidato da Thomas
Richards e l’Open Program guidato da Mario Biagini, il Workcenter
porta ancora oggi la propria ricerca artistica in tutto il mondo. Nel 2001 ritira
al Piccolo Teatro di Milano il prestigioso Premio Ubu per lo
spettacolo “One Breath Left”.</p>

incontro tra Macao e Workcenter risale allo scorso maggio durante il
Festival Folle Agire Urbano a Macao. Il Workcenter,
con la sezione guidata da Mario Biagini - l'Open Program, porta per la prima volta a
Milano un suo spettacolo. La musica, i movimenti, le voci del
Workcenter ci contaminano; il clima di quella serata, l’energia, la
vitalità e la delicatezza ci incantano. In luglio, dopo averci
invitato a Pontedera per vedere il loro lavoro, arriva a Macao anche
il team guidato da Thomas Richards. Nasce così,
attraverso reciproche ospitalità, un progetto comune: una residenza
del Workcenter a Macao, dal 3 al 12 ottobre 2014, con tre spettacoli (I Am America, Electric Party Songs, The Hydden Sayings), un workshop (Azione intenzionale e comportamento organico), la proiezione di alcuni documentari (Action in Aya Irini, Dies Iraæ: the Preposterous Theatrum Interioris Show) e una tavola rotonda sul tema dell'incontro tra ricerca teatrale e politica.
Durante la
residenza abbiamo raccolto immagini, note, frammenti di lavoro e di vita. Vogliamo infatti che
questa esperienza possa confluire nella produzione di un libro con
testi originali di Ginsberg, interviste, appunti di lavoro, note,
foto e video scaricabili tramite QR-code. Un racconto corale per dare
voce a un’esperienza realmente condivisa, che non termina con la
fine dello spettacolo. E’ un progetto
ambizioso. Macao non ha finanziatori né produttori, e abbiamo
bisogno del tuo aiuto per realizzarlo.

hospitable (…) In the Workcenter we seek a certain level of quality
in everything we do. Concerning our job, this means that we must be credible in what we do  (…) These are specific
elements linked to an actor’s work, but not only; they also are
part of life (…) I say this because in Macao I have perceived
something similar; the way in which you were helpful each day… you were not pretending to be helpful and careful. You
really were. This is the same difference between an actor who recites
and an actor who acts: you don’t believe the first, the second you
do.""Alejandro
Tomàs Rodriguez, actor of OpenProgram/Workcenter


NowHere. ACTIVE RESIDENCIESOn
Macao’s facade there is a word: NOWHERE. You can read it as “in
no place”, but also as “now here”.
NOWHERE
is an open project of artistic residencies, of which Open Program
constitutes the first stage. It is, first of all, an encounter among
people who desire a space devoted to cultural production, to the
convergence among stories, a space open to different languages and
artistic forms. 


WHAT WE WANT TO DO
The
production of a book and the videos about the experience of this
meeting stems from the desire to disseminate a collective work,
making it tangible, giving voice to the people who have lived it, to
share it beyond the limited time of the residency. This work is
developed in different phases, starting from Open Program’s
residency in Macao, integrally video recorded and documented with
notes, interviews and photographs. Once processed and post-produced,
these materials will be collected in a book with a QR-code for
accessing the video clips. 


To be able
to narrate all of this effectively is fundamental: not only for the
quality of the artists of Open Program, but also to spread as much as
possible and by appropriate means the active residencies’ program,
of which this experience is the first stage. In fact, our desire is
that more residencies will follow, with actors, musicians and artists
willing to approach an experimental form of cultural production based
on openness and dialogue.SupportersThank you for supporting our self-funding campaign: Stefano Bollani | Federico Fiumani Tiziana Ghiglioni | Têtes de Bois | Andrea MarinelliWith thanks for the advice given during the project's development: Renata M.

<h3>Quick and Dirty Show Info!</h3>
<p><strong>When</strong>: Wednesday, May 24 and Thursday, May 25, 8pm<br/><strong>Where</strong>: <a href=""https://lilypadinman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Lilypad</a>, 1353 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA<br/><strong>Tickets</strong>: Donate $20 on <strong>THIS INDIEGOGO PAGE</strong> (check out the $20 donation levels to your right), or buy with <strong>CASH</strong> at the door.

<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Seating is limited, so if you want a chair, come early!  Doors will open around 7:30. </p>
<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>When The Orange Menace was elected in November, we (Katie, Kathleen, and Anna) were disappointed in our country. And we knew it would be <strong>an attack on marginalized people</strong>: immigrants, people of color, disabled people, and women - and there are plenty of people who fall into more than one of those categories who would be scared. We knew we needed to do something, but what? Well, what we can do is <strong>sing</strong>. (We're not going to be much use in the post-apocalypse.) So we're organizing <strong>an evening of songs about women</strong>, sung by us (who are also women). And we're giving all the proceeds to <a href=""http://alloptionsprc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">All-Options Pregnancy Resource Center</a> in Indiana.

<h3>What's this money for??</h3>
<p>We want as much money as possible to go to the clinic, but there are costs involved in mounting even a small cabaret like this one. Expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$390 space rental</li>
<li>$150 musician payments</li>
<li>$100 printing costs</li>
<li>TBD: perks (the perks cost money to create, so this one depends on how many you want!)</li>
<li>All the rest: that's what we can give to the clinic!</li>

<h3>Why All-Options Pregnancy Resource Center?</h3>
<p>Well, part of the reason we chose this organization was that we are <strong>petty as hell</strong>, and since Mike Pence is from Indiana, we wanted to really get him where he literally lived. Additionally, the women of Indiana, frankly, <strong>need our help</strong> more than the gals here in Massachusetts, overall. <a href=""http://alloptionsprc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">All-Options Pregnancy Resource Center</a> provides ""support for unplanned pregnancy, miscarriage, infertility, abortion, adoption, or parenting,"" which really runs the gamut of women's health care. </p>

<p><a href=""olypulp.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pulp Productions</a>: we are a small group of students and
professionals, troubadours and tragedians, brought together by our shared
vision of what theatre—in its organization and its presentation—ought to be. We
are committed to an open, collaborative creative process, in which all are
encouraged to share their ideas and listen earnestly to others in the building
of character, craft, and authentic connection. We strive, above all, for
truth. </p>
<p>Our upcoming project is <i>The Language Archive</i> by Julia Cho<i>, </i>a contemporary play about the fallible
nature of language. The story begins with a linguist named George who amidst
his desire to archive dying languages becomes blind to what language is
actually for. The play is a poetic, mythic and dreamlike unfolding of how
language, at its essence, exists to say ‘I love you’; a heart breaking and life
affirming play about the wounds created by trying to hold on to that which is
fleeting. <br/></p>
<p>This play illustrates the bravery needed to speak a language and the courage it takes to be truly understood. Language, in this play is said to be an act of faith. And what is theatre, if not also, a great act of faith. <br/></p>
<p>Pulp Productions is currently unsponsored and unfunded, and depends entirely
on the contributions of its members, as well as the generosity of people just
like you. No theatre or performing arts company is able to survive off ticket sales alone. This is even more true for a budding ensemble like ours which strives to create exciting, fresh productions that are accessible to a wide range of audience. Our shows are either free or on a sliding scale with no one turned away due to lack of funds. This current production will be free and open to public.</p>

This is the story of riot cop-­turned-­protester Vasyl and caroller-­turned-­activist Melanka. It unfolds through traditional Central and Eastern Ukrainian carols, ballads, and psalms, in a fully interactive setting that places the audience in the centre of the action as they enjoy a traditional Ukrainian Christmas dinner.The Backstory
Counting Sheep is based on the first­hand experiences of playwrights Mark Marczyk and Marichka Kudriavtseva, who were on the Maidan and the Anti­Terrorist Operation (ATO) front in Ukraine in 2014. It stars members of local Juno­-nominated guerrilla-­folk party-­punks The Lemon Bucket Orkestra (runner-­up for Best Band in NOW Magazine's ""Best of Toronto"" poll).

<h3>Folkwang? Shakespeare?

<p>This is a fantastic opportunity, and we need support to get the cast there!

<p><i>The Yellow Wallpaper</i>
is a landmark work of American literature, written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman,
a woman who went on to be one of the most influential writers and speakers of
her time.  The beauty of the story lies
in the craft with which it is written, and the strength of its images.  It is a compact and precise work, layered
with facets of understanding about imagination, creativity, self-actualization,
depression, freedom, constraint and what defines “madness” in relation to societal
structures and norms. </p>
<p>This production of <i>The
Yellow Wallpaper</i> will use a multidisciplinary approach.  Through scripted scenes, movement, video and

narrative and part expressionistic. 
These two elements intertwine to provide a vehicle in which the
fantastical and surreal world of Charlotte’s imagination is realized through
movement, sound and video, as well as text. 
The story is told through a trio of characters, Charlotte, John and Jenny.  This trio explores the dynamics of marriage,
duty, passion, love, friendship, female camaraderie and survival.  </p>

The six actors volunteering 30+ hours to this project
The sound designer & lighting designer generating our immersive ambience
The artist who designed & drew our poster art
For set pieces including a fully functional door, bathroom signs and wall decor
For rehearsal space

Dearest Sisters,
As you're all aware the Cold War is at it's peak, but nothing will stop us from once again gathering to celebrate our Annual Quiche Breakfast this coming February.
Subsequently I have placed Veronica Schultz in charge of renovating the Susan B Anthony Society for the Sisters of Gertrude Stein headquarters to Federal Emergency Management Agency Fall Out Shelter Standards.
This is not a task that one woman alone can complete, so I am asking you, fellow widows, to band together to help raise the funds required to fully ensure our safety in the completely unlikely event of a Communist attack on our beloved United States of America.
Even the smallest donation will ensure our 1956 Annual Quiche Breakfast will be the best yet!
Yours in service,

   A Note from Buildings And Grounds Chairman- Veronica Schultz Alright Fellow Widows, it is my task as Buildings and Grounds Chairman to ensure the safety of all our Sisters when they are in attendance of society events, so I am completely renovating our Community Centre basement to proper Fall Out Shelter Standards, but I need your help.
On the right hand side of this page you'll see a number of items we require to fit out the basement, from storage and supplies to reinforced glass and our special radiation proof, steel, security door. Support your fellow sister by selecting an item and donating it's value.
In total renovations to the Community Centre will cost $10,000 and we have a limited amount of time before our Annual Quiche Breakfast this year to get the renovation complete. So dig deep and support your fellow sisters, WE NEED YOU! 




From the Men in the Other Room'5 Lesbians Eating A Quiche' began it's life in Chicago in 2011 where one half of Imprint Theatricals, Sean Bryan, was lucky enough to see it's premiere season. From the moment the show ended Sean knew he had to bring it to Australia.
From there the show went on to an award winning run off Broadway and numerous return Chicago seasons.
When Sean met Nathanael Cooper and realised that they were on the same wave length with their love of boutique theatre experiences Imprint Theatricals was born, and the perfect opportunity to bring '5 Lesbians Eating A Quiche' to Australia arose.



Imprint Theatricals intends on leaving a mark on audiences across the globe through diverse and unique producing of live theatrical events.

Sean has produced theatre in both the United States and Australia including the new musicals MARGARET FULTON: QUEEN OF THE DESSERT and FACING EAST, the acclaimed cabaret production I AM PLAYING ME and the Australasian Premiere of the Broadway musical [TITLE OF SHOW].

Nathanael is one of Australia’s leading arts and entertainment journalists with a decade of experience as an entertainment editor at the country’s top newspapers.

When '5 Lesbians Eating A Quiche' premieres on February 3, 2015  at the Brisbane Powerhouse it will be the result of a year's worth of development, hard work, blood, sweat, and eggs. 

Funds raised through this campaign will go towards bringing the production to life in Brisbane. The $10,000 we aim to raise will be broken up as follows:

-Set and Technical Requirements $3,000-Costumes and Props $2,000-Transportation $2,000 -Marketing & Publicity $3,000

Any additional funds raised will go towards furthering our reach through marketing, and developing a tour model to take the Sisters on the road.

We want you to be a part of our journey as Imprint Theatricals from the very beginning by helping to make this outrageous, laugh out loud, comedy explode onto the Australian stage. So chip in what you can, and immerse yourself into the world of '5 Lesbians Eating A Quiche.'

<h3>Hello. We are ARGONAUT.</h3>
<p>ARGONAUT is a young, new theatre company set up by Rory Horne and Nina Cavaliero.</p>
<p>We've made a play. It's called <i><strong>Action at a Distance</strong></i><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>We are taking this play to the 2017 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where it will have a 17-performance run at ZOO Southside.</p>
<p>We're very excited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's some more information about the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ARGONAUT</strong> was set up by Rory and Nina in Norwich earlier this year. Rory and Nina are both about to graduate from the University of East Anglia (UEA).</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Action at a Distance</i></strong> started life as Rory's American Studies Year Abroad Dissertation. Rory and Nina then fleshed it out for performance at Norwich's Maddermarket Theatre in February of this year. The show enjoyed three sold-out performances. (This was an Orange Skies Theatre production, in association with UEA Drama Society.)</li>
<li>The <strong>Edinburgh Festival Fringe</strong> is the biggest arts festival in the world. Each year, hundreds of thousands of creatives from theatre, comedy, music, dance, cabaret and pretty much everything else descend on Scotland's capital city for the whole of August. It's a lot of fun.</li>
<li>
<strong>ZOO Southside</strong> is one of the Fringe's two ZOO Venues located on Nicolson Street in the heart of Edinburgh. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the play:</h3>
<p><i><strong>Action at a Distance </strong></i>is a play about money, war, disconnect, American foreign policy, truth, morality, desperation, obsession, compulsion, goodness, care, reliance and love.</p>
<p><i>In a small town in Nevada, out-of-work plumber Chris stumbles across Josh, a charity worker exposing the truth behind U.S. drone strikes in Syria and Iraq. Her fascination in his world and determination to win his approval sends her down a path towards the darkest of ethical dilemmas. The play explores the relationship between money and morality, and the detachment of American citizens from the international actions of their country.</i></p>
<p><i>“An ingenious plot and a head-f**k of a concept… A really scary, exciting bit of work.”</i> (Steve Waters)</p>
<p>The play takes an original and indirect look at events in the news, showing the different and unique ways in which they interconnect with the lives of regular citizens. It is a project about which we are all incredibly passionate, both because of its relevance to ongoing global events and because of the very human, interpersonal story at its centre.</p>
<p>We will soon be taking the play back into development and rehearsals with new rewrites, new staging and a wonderful new cast, Rosa Caines and Dom Luck, with Nina also taking on a small role. Erin Fitzsimons will be our Production Manager and Molly-Rose Curran our Creative Consultant and Marketing Manager.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where you come in:</h3>
<p><strong>We need your help to make this wonderful opportunity a reality.</strong></p>
<p>Taking a show to Edinburgh is expensive for anyone, but particularly student companies trying to do it off their own backs. The show has had some wonderful responses and feedback so far, and started some very interesting conversations about its subject matter. We want to extend these conversations as far as we can, and a run of performances at the Edinburgh Fringe is a fantastic opportunity to do just that. We all care deeply about this project and are desperate for more people to see it.</p>
<p><strong>Where the money will go:</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, we need to cover the cost of our venue. We are part of the way towards reaching this, but your donations will help us to reach the total amount we owe to ZOO.</p>
<p>Our next largest cost is marketing. The main way you get an audience to come to your Fringe show is by pounding the pavements of Edinburgh, handing out flyers and putting up posters, making it known and recognisable. That means, to have a significant impact, lots of materials are needed, which cost a fairly large amount of money. We will need enough flyers for the duration of our run, and posters to replace the ones that get pasted over (it happens). </p>
<p>We also need to cover the cost of public liability insurance, as well as a small amount for props.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What we can do for you:</strong></p>
<p>We have a number of exciting perks and rewards down the right-hand side of this page. We want a way to say thank you for your support. Check them out and select the one you want! We can't wait to show you our gratitude.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Finally...</h3>
<p>If you're still reading, we love you. You're a superstar and we really appreciate your interest in <i>'Action at a Distance'.</i></p>
<p>It might be a cliche, but every little does help. Any donation you can make would be massively appreciated. Even if that can't be a financial one, it would be wonderful if you could spread the word about our show.</p>

Of course, if you're in Edinburgh from 4th - 22nd August, we'd love for you to come and see the show.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Euphonia Studio is the practice of the London-based  director, musician and scenographer Alisdair Kitchen. Working both independently, and with a community of talented associates, he creates acclaimed opera &amp; theatre productions, concerts, exhibitions, and designs for performance.</p>
<p>To look at some of our previous work, please have a look at our website <a href=""http://www.euphoniastudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any funding we seek will go towards two main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees for our talented performers</li>
<li>The hire of our venue, the The Drayton Arms Theatre.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a thank-you for your generous support, we are offering a range of limited edition prints, recordings, and original artwork - have a look at the side-bar opposite! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Euphonia Studio is proud to have a track record of excellent work, but currently most of our productions operate on a profit-share model, as we rarely have the funds to offer guaranteed fees to our performers and creatives. We want to move away from this risky and limiting model - this Autumn season marks a step in the right direction, as we are offering fixed fees. As Artistic Director, I am personally investing over half the funds needed for this project, but without full funding, we will run at a loss, which in turn has a detrimental impact on our ability to produce work in the future. The picture with full funding is much brighter - we can invest in our future, continue to build on our acclaimed work of the past few years, and offer more, better paid opportunities for talented artists. </p>

Synopsis
When his twin brother Charlie suddenly passes away, all Evan wants to do is forget their complicated relationship and move on, but the tangled relationships Charlie left behind keep Evan from truly letting go. As he falls into a spiral of self-destruction, Evan must make a stark decision: either accept and forgive his dead twin brother, or become him. Set to a lush, contemporary musical theatre score, Wearing Black explores how people grieve, and the different ways they accept and reject love. History
Wearing Black performed a 15-minute snapshot at the 2011 West Village Musical Theatre Festival, then performed the first act as part of the 2013 FRIGID Festival where it was awarded Best Original Score. Wearing Black also performed a 15-minute snapshot as part of the 2013 NYMF event Riley Thomas: Looking Forward.About the Author

<p>This play began as some funny monologues I wrote in grad school for Amie while she was pregnant about how weird people get about hiring a pregnant actress. Fast forward a year, we’ve both graduated and moved to New York and I can’t get those monologues out of my mind. I start to seriously write Essie’s story— and ironically, that was nine months ago. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Synopsis: Essie is a mid-career New York theatre actor with a shot to finally star on Broadway. She and her husband Walter have been trying to conceive for five years. Amazingly, they do! The pregnancy and the Broadway role go head to head for Essie’s future— until a fetal disability diagnosis threatens to sway the balance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a play for and by women artists (with some ally men pitching in). We're pro-life and pro-choice, we have kids and we don't, we're beginning career and mid career. We're not here to tell every woman's story about family/ career/ pregnancy/ abortion: we're here to tell one woman's story. Essie's story.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>We’re pregnant, and we’re nesting</b></p>
<p>Creating a new play is a lot like having a baby. You do all the right things, make all the right plans and still have some unexpected surprises. I know this first-hand, as I was the 2012 Best Short Solo winner at United Solo, and I’m so happy to be back to do it again with this great team. Here are our expenses, in order of need:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>ADMINISTRATIVE: $1110. Most of this is the United Solo festival fee, then rehearsal space and performance space for our June reading (ah, New York City prices). </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MARKETING: $700. We believe this show sparks a crucial conversation about women, arts careers, and families, and how hard it gets when those three butt heads. We want the audience packed on September 20 to talk with Essie about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>ARTISTS: $525 total ($125 each for actor, director, playwright, plus $75 for sound designer and $75 for stage manager). We believe in Essie and this story. We’re also professional women with families. And we believe that every artist should get respected for their work with some form of thank-you payment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>FILMING: $300. We are pursuing avenues to broadcast this show with community television networks. Our amazing colleague Lee Ann Hoover has graciously cut us a family-and-friends-only deal to film and edit the show. Help us put Lee Ann’s generosity in action and get this show into local household TVs! </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>The minimum we need to make this show happen is our administrative and marketing costs ($1810). We'd love to pay ourselves, and we'd love to pay Lee Ann to film it (the whole shebang, $2635). Please help us go all the way!</p><p><b>We’re planning for this baby’s future</b></p>
<p>I know it can feel like a lot to support a show you maybe can’t come see. We may only be at United Solo one night, but then we’re taking the show to YOU. Essie’s going on a road trip.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Women need to talk about infertility, pregnancy, abortion— <i>not </i>with politicians or protestors, but with each other in a safe, open space. Theatre is that space.</li>
<li>Amie’s already toured a show about a similarly hard topic to great success. She’s experienced leading difficult talk-backs with a variety of audiences (we’re working with a pro, people).  </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>I know that many of you reading this can't come to the show in September but wish you could. That's why raising funds for filming and marketing is so important. You're investing in the future of women listening to women through the power of art. <br/></p><p><b>Nobody said it was easy</b></p>
<p>We’ve all had experience producing theatre in a festival, and we’re so excited for United Solo. We’re ready to tear it up. But we’ve never produced a tour before (scheduled venues, organized transportation, squared away with Equity… and all the things we can’t yet see). We’re not old hands at these TV discussions (but we know this story is important and we’re going to keep fighting for it). We’re going big and praying we don’t have to go home. That’s where you come in. We’re going to rely on your support, insight and advice long after this campaign is over and it’s curtains on United Solo.

Hirschfeld and Manning, both leaders in queer and trans* rights during times of war, challenge the State's control of information and censorship of their bodies. In the face of persecution, they channel the sensual strength of queer icon St. Sebastian and the prophetic vision of Kassandra (Aeschylus’ <i>Agamemnon</i>), engaging in a timeless struggle for truth and search for utopia.

<p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Project Summary</b><br/></p><b></b><p>In
this stunning and unique performance, writer Serena Chopra joins Splintered
Light Theater, directed by shadow puppeteer Andryn Arithson, for an
unparalleled shadow performance of Chopra's forthcoming book, Ic (Horse Less
Press, 2016). </p>
<p>Through
shadow performance, Arithson articulates Chopra's Ic, short for Icarus, in his
ascent to the sun of American greatness that, in its brightness is defined by
whiteness, in its dominance is a fortress of masculinity, and in its
singularity, rejects queerness, otherness and multiplicity. At the apex of his
flight, the sun burns away Ic's marginalized identities, and he watches as his
shoes, locket, song and clothes fall, as marginalia, into the city lakes below
where the sun is scattered and spread around the bodies of divers (also <i>divers,
</i>in the Middle English usage, meaning diverse). Who will claim this
marginalia? Who will appropriate this abandoned identity? In this conceptual
retelling of Ovid's Icarus, Chopra demonstrates the struggle minorities face
with integrating their marginalized identities into mainstream institutions,
such as in higher education and corporate business. Despite being invited to
the sun as part of an institutionalized diversity initiative, Ic must dismiss
his ""non-normative"" identity to become white, masculine and
heteronormative, if he wants to thrive in the sun's opulence. Chopra's
book-length poem is driven by the bits and roots of language, the syllable,
suffix and prefix, toppling the dominance of meaning-making by taking
etymological liberties and employing multiple rhythmic profusions at once.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453427035/ebrj9s4onbqfvafs8za2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Alongside
a scored reading of the poem, Arithson's shadow work depicts Chopra's
reconstitution of the classic Icarian ascent. In Arithson's hands, shadow work,
an ancient form of live, communal performance, exudes digital qualities while
retaining the form's intimate craftwork and primal surge. Using only three
lights and a mystery trove of scrapped materials and objects, Arithson's
imagination illuminates the tension between the marginalia and corporate wash
of identity. The performance takes place in-the-round, where the audience is
surrounded, overhead, underfoot and all-about, by the visual sirens of
Arithson's craft and Chopra's potent linguistic tumbling.</p>
<p>Both
Arithson and Chopra have extensive performance backgrounds in dance, theater,
live performance art and film. <i>Ic</i> is Chopra's second full-length book
and will be Arithson's second evening-length shadow performance as
director and lead puppeteer, of a published work. This first-time
collaboration has been a long time in the making and is a beautiful manifestation of
two highly imaginative, playful, empathetic and political artists. Their
combined work is an artful measure of significant and often overlooked
institutionalized oppression. Rather than serving as a didactic soap box, the
collaboration is a visual poem, gesturing in the rhythms of light, color,
shadow and syllable, rendering the impact of oppression and whitewashing on an
individual. Together, Chopra and Arithson open <i>Ic </i>to the
collective, unspeakable muscle memory that struggles with contemporary issues
of race, queerness, and feminism within and without corporate institutions.

us to eventually attach them to dimmers, making the lights more versatile for
future performances. Light and puppetry expert, Nick

<p>My
name is Fred Rohan-Vargas, the creator and producer of Yaki Yim
Bamboo.  Our goal is to raise enough money to put on a spectacular show
for children to sing, dance and experience the fun of being who they are and
looking forward to what they’ll become. The story we tell will hopefully be a
lesson to all of us, no matter how old we are or what fears we develop. 
Change is a natural part of our being and should be a part of our understanding
as we enter the stages set forth in our life’s journey.</p>
<p>Your
support will allow us to fulfill our dream of putting a smile on every child’s
face as we reach out to children beyond the theater walls but to schools,
institutions and communities that could use a good time for their kids to
escape on this magical Caribbean island called Yaki Yim Bamboo. </p><p></p><h2><span><b>Our History</b></span></h2><p><span>YAKI YIM BAMBOO THE MUSICAL is based on THE ISLAND OF YAKI YIM BAMBOO, a children’s play that was performed with music. It was commissioned by The Sandy Ground Historical Society on Staten Island and later performed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture for the kids in Harlem. In 1984 a class of middle school students from United Nations International School presented the play with actor Dustin Hoffman’s daughter, Rebecca Hoffman, playing one of the lead roles.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, the play was performed by two professional children’s theaters, Creative Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey and The St. Louis Black Repertory Company in St. Louis, Missouri, for two of their consecutive seasons.</span></p><p><span>Like the play, the musical interacts with its audience and fills the room with the flavor of Caribbean culture as the actors dance, sing and talk in the easy to understand West Indian dialect.</span></p><h2><b>Our Budget</b></h2>
<p>We
are asking for $15,000 to cover the cost for directors, (both for stage and
music) cast, musicians, backstage personnel (i.e. stage manager, set designer,
costume designer etc.), operations and supplies. We would also like to video
tape the production, so potential contributors, like yourselves, could see what
their contributions have made possible. </p>
<h2><b>Our Thanks to You</b></h2>
<p>I
have to admit how excited we are to have people join us in achieving our goal
and since they are willing to give, we would like to do the same.

She felt something had to be done with the stories of all those women forgotten by history. We thought they had to be heard and seen in a full production. As the project started developing it became influenced by our own experiences as working actresses. We realized that there were so many other people that weren't well represented in the media and therefore ultimately stereotyped, forgotten or delegated as part of the background. That is when we decided to produce an internationally inclusive project that welcomes and celebrates the reality we are living. One where people of all sizes, colors, cultures, and accents exist and live wholly and fully.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438062738/rmrjdn6i6o81rhtlbyqu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Some of our great supporters speaking after 43sec.<br/><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlAbOEB9XMJY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlAbOEB9XMJY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlAbOEB9XMJY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438062855/rczfwbxfczt2mf8bz2ka.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Let's start with what you get!<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438062888/mivkvos9esob903nymzn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>All your perks are tax deductable!

Something we already know but, let's put it on stage!The inspiration came after Patricia went to a reading of 5 10min plays by The 365 Women a Year NYC Group which Kendra was involved in. She felt something had to be done with the stories of all those women forgotten by history. We thought they had to be heard and seen in a full production. As the project started developing it became influenced by our own experiences as working actresses. We realized that there were so many other people that weren't well represented in the media and therefore ultimately stereotyped, forgotten or delegated as part of the background. That is when we decided to produce an internationally inclusive project that welcomes and celebrates the reality we are living. One where people of all sizes, colors, cultures, and accents exist and live wholly and fully.Some of our great supporters speaking after 43sec.Let's start with what you get!All your perks are tax deductable! See them on the side!The costs of producing 2 shows including a stipend for cast, directors and crew are:Artistic team 20 actors, 7 writers, 7 directors, musical director $3100Professional fees stage manager, lighting and sound: $405Remainder of rent utilities: $885PR: $600Marketing: $400Graphic designer, website and general administration costs: $278Fundraising costs Indiegogo campaign and Fractured Atlas comission: $625Total 1 : $6293 minimum required to provide a stipend to the artistic team. This is the bare minimum we need!Total 2: $10,589 to provide a complete salary to the artistic teamTotal 3: $20,643 to prolong the festival to 5 days in Manhattan for a week and considering additional technical and artistic feesTotal 4: $45,043 for the above and to provide a basic salary to the production team and volunteers involved If we don't reach the entire goal we will not print fliers, we will rehearse in our homes, we will still produce a show! We will shorten it or ask people to donate their time but we really hope to not have to do that! If the world is a stage, the mainstream media is holding a spotlight on very specific types portraying them, sometimes, as an ideal and also a tradition. It´s easy (in most cases) to welcome them at home. We are not against it, but we want to use more lights, change the color of their lenses, to show that the same lives can be led by other types,  Your contribution can make a difference!Our final challenge is to get the budget. We already have 35 artists, one stage manager,  PR and Marketing, an accent coach, a video editor on board, so we strongly believe that by sharing our campaign amongst all our friends and family we will reach people that identify with Leela and we can achieve the minimum goal of $6293Look at our program in www.leelanycfestival.org Our plan is a strong marketing campaign. We've already been on 2 radio shows and one podcast. As soon as we get the recordings we will upload them. We have 2 blogs that will publish our story and we will have at least one other radio show!Shout out our campaign! on your Facebook page, Twitter, via email to your friends, colleagues, family, anyone you can think of.Can you provide us with?1. Rehearsal space with piano2. Choreography services3. Free use of keyboard4. Free printing of posters/cards5. Costumes6. Props7. Set design/decoration8. Volunteers (ushers, photographer, box office and more)If you can provide any of these please contact us @ leelanycfestival@gmail.com",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

--------------------------------------SOME WORKSHOP HISTORY... from Lenore DeKoven:Our Workshop began in Los Angeles in 1978 when my graduating MFA acting/directing class at UCLA didn’t want to part with each other or me.  In 1981, when I moved back to New York, several of that group relocated to New York as well and formed the nucleus of what became Our Workshop East.Since those early days, as our ranks grew and flourished, we were joined by graduates from NYU and Columbia theatre and film schools. The Workshop  became a unique creative environment for professional actors, writers and directors. Under my personal direction and using the approach outlined in my book, CHANGING DIRECTION, we work together to develop a common vocabulary, encourage individual growth and develop the techniques to serve any professional situation. It is a gym in which trained writers, directors and actors exercise and further refine their craft, expanding their abilities through mutual collaboration in a supportive and challenging environment.  Thus the work on any given night might include the development or direction of a play or screenplay, preparation of an actor’s audition or a singer’s aria or work on a scene from a Shakespeare play from both acting and directing points of view. Notable Workshop alumni include Ang Lee, Lisa Cholodenko and Debra Granik.From time to time the Workshop has initiated a group project that might utilize some or all of the crafts: acting, writing and directing, often encouraging members to cross over into less familiar disciplines.

<p><b>The Story…</b></p>
<p><i>Aeterno Elementum </i>takes
place in a world filled with cruelty and hate, where suffering and misery have
become so commonplace that the very heavens themselves become twisted and
corrupted. One man, with the best of intentions, sets about trying to restore
purity to the world, but succeeds only in hastening the world’s tragically inevitable,
and necessary, death. Four men hold the key to the world’s rebirth: a disgraced
Samurai, a corrupt nobleman, a former assassin, and a unconquerable warlord.
And behind it all stands the Demoness, borne of mankind’s cruelty, who has come
to orchestrate the world’s ending. </p>
<p>Aeterno Elementum isn’t a story that will just occur on
stage, it will play out around you and amongst you. You’ll feel the heat of the
flames as betrayal claims a man’s honor. You’ll hear the waves break against
the rocks as envy and desire dooms a man’s soul. You’ll see assassins creeping
through the audience, perhaps even sneak right past you, as they hunt a man who
couldn’t escape his past. The drums of war will echo in your chest as mankind
makes one final stand.</p>

<p>Jeremiah Johnson began Ara’Kus Productions six years ago
when he first began composing <i>Aeterno
Elementum</i>. It began with just a small group of friends playing in bars and
clubs, but it quickly became clear that they couldn’t tell the story they
wanted to in such limited venues. That’s when they began taking their songs
onto the stage, using their heavy metal music to craft an opera unlike any
other. The uniqueness of <i>Aeterno
Elementum </i>quickly brought in waves of talented and passionate people who
were eager to take part, volunteering their time and talents to bring <i>Aeterno Elementum to life</i>. From a small
group of musicians, we’ve grown into a full blown theater production company of
nearly sixty people, featuring a full heavy metal band and choir, as well as:</p>

<p>We’re seeking to raise $9000 dollars in order to pay for our

<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>We’re a group of artists and creators that are incredibly
passionate about this show, and we’ve had six years of experience bringing the
apocalypse to the stage with limited resources. We’ve brought to life epic
fights between demons and knights with an impossibly small budget, so we know
how to get the most of our resources. That said, this is without a doubt our
most ambitious project to date and is going to represent both a significant challenge
to pull off and a huge risk for our company. </p>
<p>The costumes alone are going to be a tremendous task to
create, and since we’re working with a stage nearly twice the size of what
we’re used to, set construction will be a massive undertaking. Getting the
lighting, the sound, the special effects and the combat choreography all to
mesh together perfectly will be a great challenge. It won’t be easy, but with
your support, we’re confident we can do it.</p>
<p><b>Spread the Word of
the Coming Apocalypse</b></p>
<p>We want you to spread the word of the coming apocalypse.
Even if you can’t afford to support us financially, simply spreading the word

<p>The Liberty Theatre is an important piece of La Grande's and Eastern Oregon's history that deserves to be preserved. However, beyond the preservation is the impact that this theater will have on the members of our community. The theater will host a wide-variety of programming from plays, musical performances, Oregon Humanities talks, dance and more!

<p>You hold the key to our success! Your gift to the sign recreation project relights the Liberty Theatre, reintroducing it to our community as a theater once again. It opens the door for future giving and is a symbol of what many of us know to be true, the Liberty will thrive once again. <br/></p>

The total budget for this project is about $40,000. Over 75% of the funds will come from grants. We are aiming to raise the remaining $10,000 from our community through fundraisers and larger individual gifts. We have set a goal of $2,000 online, but it is our ultimate goal to raise more than that. We know our supporters can do it! If we do not meet our goal, funds will still go to support the sign project. <br/></p>
<p>As a nonprofit organization, and a young one that that, we do not have a collection of fancy perks to reward you with. Instead we want your donation to go directly to the sign, not into our operating budget. Your gift makes a greater impact this way!</p>

<p>Since its closure in 1959, the Liberty Theatre has slowly faded from community memory. Most that pass by the building on the street see the building as retail space only, the former home of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Theater_%28La_Grande,_Oregon%29#/media/File:Liberty_Theater_-_La_Grande_Oregon.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dominos Pizza</a>.  Little do they know that within the walls of the Liberty is a partially preserved theater waiting to be uncovered once again.</p>
<p>You can bring the memory of the theater back to life by helping us put a replica of its historic sign back on the building.  This sign is completely unique. There are no signs left like it in Eastern Oregon! It will be what the Liberty is recognized by for decades to come. </p>
<p>With this increased recognition comes the opportunity to gather more support for restoring the theater from our community and our region. Your gift to this project multiplies the amount we can raise in the future!</p>

 The Liberty Theatre Foundation is a nonprofit organization located in La Grande, Oregon. Our mission is to restore and operate the Liberty Theatre as a community performing arts center that will serve our region.

La Grande is situated at the foothills of the Blue Mountains in rural Eastern Oregon with a population of about 12,000. During it's height, the town hosted five different theaters. But times changed for the both the community and the entertainment landscape. Today only one of these theaters remains in operation. 

The Liberty Theatre is an important piece of La Grande's and Eastern Oregon's history that deserves to be preserved. However, beyond the preservation is the impact that this theater will have on the members of our community. The theater will host a wide-variety of programming from plays, musical performances, Oregon Humanities talks, dance and more! The Foundation will collaborate with existing community arts organizations like Eastern Oregon Film Festival, La Grande Shakespeare and the Elgin Opera House to increase the accessibility and quality of programming available to the citizens of the Grande Ronde Valley. 

You hold the key to our success! Your gift to the sign recreation project relights the Liberty Theatre, reintroducing it to our community as a theater once again. It opens the door for future giving and is a symbol of what many of us know to be true, the Liberty will thrive once again. 

  What We Need & What You Get

 We are seeking $2,000 from our online community to help us make the recreation of the sign happen! The total budget for this project is about $40,000. Over 75% of the funds will come from grants. We are aiming to raise the remaining $10,000 from our community through fundraisers and larger individual gifts. We have set a goal of $2,000 online, but it is our ultimate goal to raise more than that. We know our supporters can do it! If we do not meet our goal, funds will still go to support the sign project. 
As a nonprofit organization, and a young one that that, we do not have a collection of fancy perks to reward you with. Instead we want your donation to go directly to the sign, not into our operating budget. Your gift makes a greater impact this way!
That said, we do have a few fun things lined out to thank you for your gift. Check them out on your right!
If you are an Oregonian, your gift will qualify you for a tax-credit from the Oregon Cultural Trust.  Match your gift to the Liberty Theatre Foundation with a gift to OCT and receive your OCT gift back as a tax credit. Visit OCT's website for more information. 

  The Impact

 The installation of the sign on the facade of the Liberty Theatre will have a profound impact on the projection and future of the restoration project as a whole. 
Since its closure in 1959, the Liberty Theatre has slowly faded from community memory. Most that pass by the building on the street see the building as retail space only, the former home of Dominos Pizza.  Little do they know that within the walls of the Liberty is a partially preserved theater waiting to be uncovered once again.
You can bring the memory of the theater back to life by helping us put a replica of its historic sign back on the building.  This sign is completely unique. There are no signs left like it in Eastern Oregon! It will be what the Liberty is recognized by for decades to come. 
With this increased recognition comes the opportunity to gather more support for restoring the theater from our community and our region. Your gift to this project multiplies the amount we can raise in the future!
Check out a video done by the La Grande Observer's Tim Mustoe last December that talks about the impact of the project. 

  Risks & Challenges Like all restoration projects, the restoration of the Liberty Theatre and the fabrication and installation of the sign could take longer than the projected timeline. In the past, delayed timelines have been as a result of funding constraints. This is why were are seeking assistance from our community early on in order negate this issue. 
This project will be partially funded by grants. There is a chance that our grant requests will not be 100% funded. As such, we have built in cushioning into our budget to prevent this from creating a delay in the project.  

  Other Ways You Can Help

 Any gift matters, no matter what the size. Even a dollar moves us one step closer to a beautiful, restored theater.

Hi,
My name is Anthony W Johnson. I am the creator of Ballet Magique. Ballet Magique is a fusion of dance, magic, illusion, music, theatre and wushu. The performers not only dance but perform magic and illusion. We have been offered the opportunity to perform We have been offered the opportunity to perform  for the Chinese New Year celebration in San Diego California. as well as other festivals abroad. 
Our goal is to raise enough capital to mount spectacular performance of our show The Ring of the Rose. 
Ring of the Rose is the story of brothers who upon chance fall in love with the same woman. The brothers are in constant turmoil with their own relationship as well as the cultural differences of the races. This turmoil leads to varied conflicts and choices when one of the brothers decides to take matters into his own hands. The Ring of Rose is a passionate love story full of high intense , and dynamic , diverse dance forms, pulsating magic and suspense with awe dropping wushu martial arts and vibrant costumes. 
The Ring of the Rose was first performed by Ballet Magique in Glendale CA to great success, with four Lester Horton Nominations and offers to perform the 10 minute act in various places around the world. Unfortunately as we were about to move forward Gene Wooley my former partner took ill and needed a liver transplant. He eventually, after many struggles and lots of pain, succumbed to his illness and passed away. Because this was and still is our dream, I am determined to keep his memory alive. One way I believe I can do this is to pick up where we left off, and mount the full version of Ring of the Rose for investors as well as the public who have supported us this far and use the capital from that performance to mount the tour that Gene and me always dreamed of.

Over the years, as a teacher, I have spawned many dancers who have danced for me in Ballet Magique and gone on to fantastic careers with Cirque du Soliel, Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre on on Broadway in shows like The Lion King, Come Fly Away, Movin Out and The Color Purple, as well as tours with Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.

Ballet Magique’s mission is to inspire dancers of all nationalities, and to create a new an exciting form of entertainment fusing not only the cultural arts but media technology and illusion.
By fusing classic art forms, including several different kinds of dance, magic, music, theatre, and visual effects, we elevate all of them to a new and glorious level that entrances all audiences even those who have seen all of our competitor’s productions. 

Ballet Magique Entertainment stands alone in the pantheon of artistic achievement and we are committed to enriching current and future generations by offering a fascinating outlook on the virtuosity of the human body, while engaging the mystique of the human psyche. 

What We Need
The funds that we are raising here will help towards offsetting travel costs to San Diego as well to help mount the show.
 
Other Ways to Help
Ballet Magique has been very fortunate to have had overwhelming pubic support over the years for which we are extremely grateful and truly appreciate.  Every dollar raised will be spent on hard costs to put up the best show possible so we hope that you will reach out to your friends and family on our behalf and help us spread the word so that we can reach our goal and begin our new journey.

<p>We are proud to be presenting the world premiere of A LADY IN WAITING this August at Soulstice Theatre in Milwaukee, WI. Written by local playwright Liz Shipe, A LADY IN WAITING is an adventurous new twist on the legendary story of Robin Hood, told from a female point of view. </p>
<p>With this show, we honor a tradition of giving held by our partner, Soulstice Theatre. In the charitable spirit of Robin Hood, we will donate a portion of our box office sales to Hunger Task Force.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Last year, we had a huge response to our Kickstarter campaign for the world premiere of A THOUSAND TIMES GOODNIGHT. This year, by popular demand, we are bringing several rewards to our audiences who don't mind pitching in a little extra to become a bigger part of the show.</p>
<p>As a small theater company, Theater RED often dreams bigger than its production budget allows. This campaign will allow us to fully realize our production plans, all while providing our backers with a unique and fun way to experience the show!</p>
<p>By supporting our project you will be helping us transform not only the theater, but also the lobby space into Sherwood Forest for a complete immerse audience experience – and who knows what you may find in the forest before the show!</p>
<p>From costumes by Liz Shipe to original music by Brian Myers and wondrous lighting effects by Alan Piotrowicz and AntiShadows, LLC, your contribution will bring the characters of Nottingham and Sherwood Forest to life, and transport patrons to the legendary world of Robin Hood for an evening of action, adventure, and fun!</p>
<ul></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>No contribution is too small. At the $5 level, you can be a part of the show with your name on a Wanted Poster on one of the trees in Sherwood Forest! The reward structure aims to provide unique perks at varying contribution levels to allow you to experience the show in an enhanced way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will use any contributions received to focus first on transforming the theater and lobby to immerse our audience in Sherwood Forest from the moment they walk through the doors. Remaining funds will dress our Merry Men, our Nobles, and our ladies in the best finery.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Theater RED was founded to provide substantial roles for women, support growth for artists, and produce new works, especially by local playwrights. We are proud to present A LADY IN WAITING, which meets all these founding tenets by telling a classic story for audiences from a uniquely female perspective for a fresh twist on an adventurous classic; providing stage combat training from Dueling Arts International Associate Instructor Christopher Elst in the disciples of broadsword and quarterstaff that will be featured in the show (talk about live action!) And, producing an original play by local budding playwright Liz Shipe. Liz is the author of the SHERLOCK HOLMES TRILOGY and HOME FOR CHRISTMAS, which have both had successful runs in Milwaukee theaters, and she is currently writing a holiday show by commission for 2015.</p>
<p>Theater RED has had success with fundraising in the past. Last year, Theater RED produced its first world premiere, A THOUSAND TIMES GOODNIGHT, and exceeded its funding goal on its Kickstarter campaign. Theater RED has chosen Indiegogo for A LADY IN WAITING because it wanted to be transparent with its backers that the funding will be used to fully realize the production plans and vision for the show, but the basic plans and design have already been accounted for in the show’s budget.</p>
<p>Help us “plant” trees, sew costumes, and enhance the performance with lights, music, and props to fully immerse the audience in our world for a night, and share in the action, adventure, and intrigue of Nottingham and Sherwood Forest!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We recognize that being dependent on fundraising brings with it risks and challenges, chief of them being that if our funding goals are not fully realized, we will need to make decisions about where the money we are grateful to have raised should be first earmarked. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We also realize that Theater RED had a successful fundraising campaign in November of 2013 and contributors might feel less compelled to donate to our theater again in less than a one year period. We hope that our founding principles and this world premiere production resonate with potential backers, and that the perks we are offering offer a unique benefit to supporting our efforts once again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Acknowledging our past successes and the help that so many people have provided to Theater RED in the past, we are proud to partner with Hunger Task Force for this production to pay that forward in a small way.</p>

</div>
<p>We know that there are many worthwhile projects that ask for your financial support and that it is impossible to donate to them all. We hope you will consider sharing this project with your family and friends.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This show started out as a way to get young people interested in Shakespeare 7 years ago. Since then, this hybrid of Macbeth and the Star Wars Universe has been performed three times for children's theatre and once at a regional theater in Michigan. This newest production marks its first debut by professionals for a Chicago audience. It is fast paced, epically staged, and a whole lotta fun!</p>
<p>Understand that this is Shakespeare's Macbeth set in the Star Wars Universe. It isn't Luke Skywalker; it's Young Siward. It's not Obi Wan; it's King Duncan. Shakespeare's traditional language is there, but so are the lightsabers!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>EDGE Community Theatre is unique in that it is produced by the company. Everyone kicks in dues, and then from there we assemble our budget. But we are a semi-pro theatre so our professionals get paid once that budget has been wiped out. Your gifts allow this to happen!</p>
<p>Our perks are a mixture of the classic and the fantastic! Any amount helps, but we recommend the Audio Drama. We are recording an old timey radio show of our production complete with scoring and sound effects! So if you are unable to make it to Chicago to see the show live, you can still experience it!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Keeping the classics relevant to all people remains as important to our culture now as it did 7 years ago when this project started. This show remains the perfect experience to thrill an old Shakespeare enthusiast or a complete newbie!</p>
<p>EDGE premiered last year with the well received loving tribute to The Princess Bride. Its production team also succesfully mounted two productions of Pirates of Penzance under sail on the Tall Ship Windy at Chicago's Navy Pier. Our track record shows we are dedicated story tellers bringing the exciting and unusual to the stage!</p>

As Director of Philadelphia Dance
Projects (PDP) and a former dancer/choreographer, I have initiated the LOCAL DANCE HISTORY PROJECT. The impetus for this project was
practical.  Several cardboard boxes had
been following me around for over 30 years from place to place. The contents of
these boxes marked “archive” were a jumble of disintegrating papers and odd
video formats, slides, photos and super-8 film reels – of myself a
dancer/improviser and other artist collaborators   What to do with this?  How to get this history out of these boxes?  These boxes tell a story at a pivotal
time for artists in Philadelphia - a story of developing forms and genres,
communities and life styles.  In 2010 through PDP's Local Dance History Project, I invited  Michael Biello, Dan Martin, Jano Cohen and Ishmael Houston-Jones to revisit some of the work of these original artists, including myself, with live performances, a workshop and a forum.
 The performances featured collaborations with a new generation of
dancers reconstructing  and re-imagining a selection of legacy dance works.                        [Jano Cohen's  ""Snow Falling on Waves""  photo: Brian Mengini]These
regenerated and revitalized ­dance works not only captured the spirit of those
original works but also the imaginations of a new sphere of artists and
audiences.  The wonderful success
of these ‘local dance’ intergenerational works went a long way to validating
the value and relevancy of these original artists and their work. It
underscored the importance of sharing, preserving AND expanding these
“stories” as part of a greater context in the creative community and our city’s
history. - Terry Fox, PDP Director and LDHP dance artist
What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking to
raise $7,500 to build the first phase of the Local Dance History Project website. Support will go to designer
fees, hosting costs and digitalization of archival materials. If all goes well, and
funds are raised, we can launch this phase in the Fall of 2014! And begin
to share and gather more stories that are a part of this unique dance history. 
Help us launch the first interactive web page of
the Local Dance History Project with the TIMELINE. We
will begin with a very special look into the evolution of post modern dance as
glimpsed through the microcosm of an especially rich and vibrant era of
independent dance and performance that was taking place in Philadelphia in the
1970’s and 80’s, beginning with artists; Terry Beck, Michael Biello, Jac Carley, Jano Cohen, Terry Fox, Tonio Guerra, Wendy Hammarstrom, Ishmael Houston-Jones, Steve Krieckhaus, and Dan Martin. 
Were you a choreographer, dancer, musician,
visual artist, actor, performance artist, audience member ?  You will be able to tell your story by adding it
to the Local Dance History Project TIMELINE.                                                                                 [Design by Night Kitchen Interactive]This special dance history will not only be

permanent home.The Impact
The
Local Dance History Project is designed to re-engage audiences in an archival
collection of dance & performance work from the 70’s and 80’s and make it
relevant to today’s audiences.  It will serve as a bridge for accessing the role artists have played in the city’s cultural history; for connecting to artists and audiences; and grow that history into the 90’s and on into the 21st century. Your contribution will make it possible to build
a site that engages audiences both old and new, perpetuates these works and
preserves these experiences. Please become a part of this exciting project and
help us tell our story and your story through the Local Dance History Project
Timeline.
 With
the Local Dance History Project, Philadelphia will have the first accessible
web archive for dance ! This robust digital center will present possibilities for live programming as well as archival or static collections for
exhibitions. It will serve a model for other cities and their histories creating a
larger view of dance nationally.

<p>Hello!
My name is Ashley Forché and I’m a sophomore at Columbus School for Girls and a
dancer at BalletMet. I have been dancing since I was three years old and it has
truly become my passion. My ultimate goal is to become a professional
dancer. Dance provides me with a joy unlike anything else and has enriched
my life in so many ways. When I dance, I am my purest form of myself, the best
version of me, and that is why I love dance more than anything in the world. I
have been in many performances including The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Alice in
Wonderland, Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and Carnival of the Animals. I
have also attended several local summer intensive programs in the past, including BalletMet’s
Summer Intensive and Columbus Dance Theatre’s Summer Intensive, but I have not been able to take advantage of out of state opportunities due to limited financial resources. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/456139/files/20140324083111-tutuparty.jpg?1395675071"" src="""" style=""width: 254px; height: 254px;""/></p><p>This

over the summer will allow me to grow by leaps and bounds as a dancer. Additionally, it will

</p><p>What happens when you take a terrible movie and set out to make an even more terrible musical? Jeff Thomson, Jordan Mann and David Eck decided to find out. All three were serious creators of musical theatre. They had everything that emerging artists need to make a name for themselves, awards, the respect of their peers and no money.</p>
<p>Being serious is all well and good, but every so often, there's a joy in writing something ridiculous, and as they sought a property to adapt, one name axe murdered its way up to the top of their list.</p>
<p><i>ThanksKilling</i>. A movie about a foul-mouthed homicidal turkey that didn't include Rob Ford.</p>
<p>After seeing the original film of <i>ThanksKilling</i>, all three realized that this Turkey could not only fly. It could sing.</p>
<p>The original film's shoddy brilliance, its deliberately cliched characters, bad acting, terrible puns, absurd premise and keen self awareness are now the stuff of legend and the creators sought to not just polish the turd before them, but to embrace its turdiness and hold it aloft for all the world to see.</p>
<p>After receiving permission from the film's original creators, and embracing the film's ""we shot it in a week for no money"" essence, Jeff and Jordan wrote the entire show in three days. They were long days, filled with music, laughter and endless discussions on how many possible rhymes exist for MOTHER F**KER. As Jeff and Jordan wrote, the sublime and ridiculous got together and had a cheap and torrid one night stand and while several souls were condemned to the nether regions of hell, the work was completed and a musical was born in an orgy of blood and feathers and bad bird puns. </p>
<p>The show was then blessed to be embraced by Balagan Theatre of Seattle, Washington who endowed the show with a cast, a director and the best scenery and costumes that could be had for $4.20.</p>
<p>It was just what was required, and <i>ThanksKilling The Musical</i> burst forth like a necromanced turkey through the innards of an inbred hick to audience adulation and critical praise.</p>
<p>Where will the Turkey strike next?

And use our things. I figure it’ll take a war to settle it all.”  </i>Said, Returning to Haifa</p><p><strong>Synopsis:</strong></p><p>In 1948, Palestinian couple Said and Safiyya fled their home in Haifa during the 1948 Nakba. Now, in the aftermath of the 1967 Six Day War, the borders are open for the first time in twenty years, and the couple dare to return back to their home. They are prepared to find someone else living where they once did. Yet nothing can prepare Said and Safyya for the encounter they both desire and dread: the long-awaited news about the son they had to leave behind..</p><p><strong>Why we're making it happen now:</strong></p><p>This project brings a new intimacy to this beautiful and powerful story by turning it into a stage show for the first time. Ghassan Kanafani had extraordinary compassion for all touched by war, displacement and occupation. The questions he posed to us in 1968 about <u>human nature and about the need to remember and to resist</u> remain as pertinent today as they were in 1969. We want it to happen <strong>now</strong>, as <u>2018 marks the 70th anniversary</u> of the dispossession of three quarters of a million Palestinians -  a traumatic event which profoundly shaped Kanafani’s life and about which he wrote so passionately before his assassination in 1972.</p><p><strong>About the Adaptation (and why it hasn't happened in New York...yet):</strong></p><p>This adaptation by award-winning playwrights <u>Naomi Wallace and Ismail Khalidi </u>was originally commissioned by New York’s Public Theater, which had committed to programming the play but subsequently abandoned the production after political pressure from the board.</p><p>Determined not to let <u>censorship</u> keep the public from hearing this vital, visionary voice, Naomi Wallace approached many theaters in the US and UK. It was the fearless Finborough Theatre that came forward to offer their stage for Kanafani’s work.</p><p><u>It now receives its long-overdue world premiere.</u></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Help us break the censorship surrounding works by Palestinian authors in english-speaking theaters and bring this beautiful story to the stage.</strong></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TELL ME ABOUT THE MONEY!</strong></h3><p>This play needs the backing and support of a community of people who believe Kanafani’s voice should be heard now in all it's richness and humanity. This time around, we want <u>total creative control. </u>We refuse to be at the mercy of conservative theater boards and big money venues pulling invisible strings that can collapse a project without warning.</p><p>We are  determined to present the world class stage production this story deserves, which means assembling a <u>top-notch international creative team</u>. So, this is where <strong>you</strong> come in:</p><ul>
<li>Our total budget is <u>$40,000.</u>
</li>
<li>We have already raised a huge<u> $30,000</u> from supportive sources which means...</li>
<li>If you help us raise the last <u><strong>$10,000</strong>,</u> then this show will become a reality!</li>
<li>Your funds go <i>directly</i> to paying the actors, designers and production team. They will pay for materials for the set, costumes, lights and props. Your money = the physical show itself.</li>
</ul><p>In return we are offering some exciting <u>perks</u> for our supporters!</p><p>If you are in the UK/Europe at the time of the show we have <u>exclusive free tickets</u> for the Press Night. We also have<u> lovely materials</u> from the rehearsals and production so that you can be in on the process of making this show (signed by the writers and actors!), and on top of that, <u>bespoke workshops</u> for you aspiring writers/actors/directors out there!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE PRESS! THE QUOTES! (What people have said about this project and the team)</strong></h3><p><strong>On the project:</strong></p><p>“You should support this project if you oppose the censorship of silenced voices, and if you want to allow a broad audience access to the eloquent, humanistic work of Ghassan Kanafani. One of the most gifted Palestinian writers of the past century, Kanafani fiercely opposed oppression with his pen. He is still being pursued beyond the grave by those who malign him as a ""terrorist.""

(What’s this all about?) We - playwrights Naomi Wallace, Ismail Khalidi and director Caitlin McLeod - need your help to stage this exciting World Premiere of the english-language adaptation of RETURNING TO HAIFA by renowned Palestinian author Ghassan Kanafani in London, February 2018!This is a darkly comic, deeply human story of two families - one Palestinian, one Israeli - forced by history into an intimacy they didn't choose. This is a drama about memory, erasure and resistance, with frontline immediacy that returns politics to its most personal form.With your help RETURNING TO HAIFA will receive a full four week run at the brave and award-winning Finborough theatre in London (UK) in the New Year. (check out the theatre here http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/)                                                Ismail Khalidi and Naomi Wallace at the grave of Ghassan Kanafani, Beirut.THE PLAY“You haven’t asked, but yes, you both may stay in our house for the time being. And use our things. I figure it’ll take a war to settle it all.”  Said, Returning to HaifaSynopsis:In 1948, Palestinian couple Said and Safiyya fled their home in Haifa during the 1948 Nakba. Now, in the aftermath of the 1967 Six Day War, the borders are open for the first time in twenty years, and the couple dare to return back to their home. They are prepared to find someone else living where they once did. Yet nothing can prepare Said and Safyya for the encounter they both desire and dread: the long-awaited news about the son they had to leave behind..Why we're making it happen now:This project brings a new intimacy to this beautiful and powerful story by turning it into a stage show for the first time. Ghassan Kanafani had extraordinary compassion for all touched by war, displacement and occupation. The questions he posed to us in 1968 about human nature and about the need to remember and to resist remain as pertinent today as they were in 1969. We want it to happen now, as 2018 marks the 70th anniversary of the dispossession of three quarters of a million Palestinians -  a traumatic event which profoundly shaped Kanafani’s life and about which he wrote so passionately before his assassination in 1972.About the Adaptation (and why it hasn't happened in New York...yet):This adaptation by award-winning playwrights Naomi Wallace and Ismail Khalidi was originally commissioned by New York’s Public Theater, which had committed to programming the play but subsequently abandoned the production after political pressure from the board.Determined not to let censorship keep the public from hearing this vital, visionary voice, Naomi Wallace approached many theaters in the US and UK. It was the fearless Finborough Theatre that came forward to offer their stage for Kanafani’s work.It now receives its long-overdue world premiere.Help us break the censorship surrounding works by Palestinian authors in english-speaking theaters and bring this beautiful story to the stage.TELL ME ABOUT THE MONEY!This play needs the backing and support of a community of people who believe Kanafani’s voice should be heard now in all it's richness and humanity. This time around, we want total creative control. We refuse to be at the mercy of conservative theater boards and big money venues pulling invisible strings that can collapse a project without warning.We are  determined to present the world class stage production this story deserves, which means assembling a top-notch international creative team. So, this is where you come in:
Our total budget is $40,000.

We have already raised a huge $30,000 from supportive sources which means...
If you help us raise the last $10,000, then this show will become a reality!
Your funds go directly to paying the actors, designers and production team. They will pay for materials for the set, costumes, lights and props. Your money = the physical show itself.
In return we are offering some exciting perks for our supporters!If you are in the UK/Europe at the time of the show we have exclusive free tickets for the Press Night. We also have lovely materials from the rehearsals and production so that you can be in on the process of making this show (signed by the writers and actors!), and on top of that, bespoke workshops for you aspiring writers/actors/directors out there!THE PRESS! THE QUOTES! (What people have said about this project and the team)On the project:“You should support this project if you oppose the censorship of silenced voices, and if you want to allow a broad audience access to the eloquent, humanistic work of Ghassan Kanafani. One of the most gifted Palestinian writers of the past century, Kanafani fiercely opposed oppression with his pen. He is still being pursued beyond the grave by those who malign him as a ""terrorist."" With your contribution, you can help to right this wrong.”  - Rashid Khalidi, Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies, University of Columbia, NY.“Please support this.

The Mod Musical</i>) and regionally (we worked together on <i>High Hair &amp; Jalapenos</i>).  Peter has examined gay themes in the past, most notably in <i>Howard Crabtree's Whoop Dee Doo!</i>  And, of course, Randy has numerous Broadway credits: <i>42nd Street</i>, <i>White Christmas</i>, <i>Dames at Sea</i>, and <i>Ain't Broadway Grand</i> (which Peter second-acted!)</p><p> </p><p><strong>Peter Charles Morris, Librettist/Lyricist</strong></p><p> </p><p>Peter Charles Morris was most recently represented off-Broadway by <i>Shout!

He was the co-author and co-lyricist of <i>Howard Crabtree’s Whoop-Dee-Doo!</i>, winner of the 1994 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical Revue. His musicalization of <i>The Adventures of Mottel</i>, based on Sholom Aleichem’s last book, was commissioned by the Kaufman Cultural Arts Center of New York and performed at Merkin Hall in March 2007. Other produced works include <i>Frankly, Scarlett</i>, a farce co-authored with Phillip George, about the making of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>; <i>The Remarkable Ruth Fields</i>, a musical comedy about the trials and tribulations of a bearded lady, which received five 1992 Backstage Bistro Awards; <i>Listen to the Wind</i>, the 1995 revival of the 1955 British musical for which he fashioned a new libretto; and <i>High Hair &amp; Jalapenos</i>, an original musical revue lampooning Texas which has become a regular theatrical event in San Antonio. His musical version of William Makepeace Thackeray’s fairy tale novella <i>The Rose and the Ring</i> premiered in London in December 2001, and had an international tour of Canada, England and Australia in 2004. He has written numerous one-act plays, winning the Tennessee Williams One-Act Play Competition for <i>The World’s Longest Kiss</i>. His full-length play <i>No Place Like Home</i> premiered at South Carolina’s Trustus Theatre in 2004. He served as script consultant for <i>My Favorite Broadway: The Love Songs</i>, which was performed at NY’s City Center and subsequently aired on PBS.

And you can help remind audiences that same-sex love and marriage are to be respected and protected.  What we need Our goal for this campaign is $30,000. Every dollar will go directly into production costs. Of course, it costs much more than that to mount an Off-Broadway production. Our producer, Donna Trinkoff, is also raising money by traditional means. But every dollar helps. We need to pay for the costumes and set, the rental of the theater, advertising, and of course, salaries for the actors, the director/choreographer, the designers and the crew. Even if we don't reach our Indiegogo goal, the funds will still contribute enormously to paying for the production.  Why is Gotta Getta Girl important? Of course, we would be thrilled to have a successful production of Gotta Getta Girl; if the show is well-received, it could have a profitable life in stock and regional productions. It could further our careers.  And it could open the minds of those who do not understand gay people or appreciate that they too have a right to love. What are the challenges? The biggest challenge will be getting the public interested in a new, small, intimate Off-Broadway musical in an era when Off-Broadway is in a slump.  But we are well qualified to deal with this. We've both worked Off-Broadway (I music-directed Forbidden Broadway for ten years; Peter wrote Shout! The Mod Musical) and regionally (we worked together on High Hair & Jalapenos).  Peter has examined gay themes in the past, most notably in Howard Crabtree's Whoop Dee Doo!  And, of course, Randy has numerous Broadway credits: 42nd Street, White Christmas, Dames at Sea, and Ain't Broadway Grand (which Peter second-acted!) Peter Charles Morris, Librettist/Lyricist Peter Charles Morris was most recently represented off-Broadway by Shout! The Mod Musical, for which he co-authored the book. (The show is currently being produced by small theatres across the country.) He was the co-author and co-lyricist of Howard Crabtree’s Whoop-Dee-Doo!, winner of the 1994 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical Revue. His musicalization of The Adventures of Mottel, based on Sholom Aleichem’s last book, was commissioned by the Kaufman Cultural Arts Center of New York and performed at Merkin Hall in March 2007. Other produced works include Frankly, Scarlett, a farce co-authored with Phillip George, about the making of Gone with the Wind; The Remarkable Ruth Fields, a musical comedy about the trials and tribulations of a bearded lady, which received five 1992 Backstage Bistro Awards; Listen to the Wind, the 1995 revival of the 1955 British musical for which he fashioned a new libretto; and High Hair & Jalapenos, an original musical revue lampooning Texas which has become a regular theatrical event in San Antonio. His musical version of William Makepeace Thackeray’s fairy tale novella The Rose and the Ring premiered in London in December 2001, and had an international tour of Canada, England and Australia in 2004. He has written numerous one-act plays, winning the Tennessee Williams One-Act Play Competition for The World’s Longest Kiss. His full-length play No Place Like Home premiered at South Carolina’s Trustus Theatre in 2004. He served as script consultant for My Favorite Broadway: The Love Songs, which was performed at NY’s City Center and subsequently aired on PBS. Mr. Morris is an alumnus of the BMI Advanced Musical Theatre Workshop. David Caldwell, Composer David Caldwell composed music and lyrics for All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten and Uh-Oh Here Comes Christmas, both based on the writing of Robert Fulghum. He also composed music for Fulghum's novel Third Wish. David was the music director of Forbidden Broadway from 2004 to 2014. He conducted the American premiere of Stephen Schwartz's Children of Eden. He recently music-directed Murder For Two Off-Broadway, as well as three shows in China, with Inner Mongolian authors and casts. He arranged and orchestrated Marvin Hamlisch's song “I'm Really Dancing” for Career Transitions for Dancers' 25th Anniversary Gala, featuring Angela Lansbury, Chita Rivera and Bebe Neuwirth. David is originally from New Hampshire. He is a graduate of Oberlin Conservatory. He is interviewed at length in Oliver Sacks' book about music and the brain, Musicophilia. He is on the faculty of the American Musical & Dramatic Academy, and is married to Alyssa H. Chase.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
