Following playlist contains some of those reviews. Il existe des développeurs indépendants partout dans le monde et c'est donc avec un certain plaisir que nous avons aujourd'hui déniché une production venue de Corée -Jeuxvideo.com It’s shaping up very nicely and it’s a pretty tense experience – the world can be a surprisingly scary place when you’re only a few inches tall! -AlphaBetaGamer        KEEP OUT is a horror and mystery puzzle adventure game.A whole story of Keep OUT is from Devota Hill in 2044, in which players are set to challenge themselves anew by using unconventional character portrayals become ""Mr. M"", the toy of a wise and benevolent monarch, and freshly woven plot twists to the secrets of Devota Hill and HumathScience.You can see the detail of KEEP OUT stories translated into Japanese, French, Korean via Official Page.           Players explore Devota Hill by manipulating Mr. M in 3D, cross-scroll (side scroller) views.You may have to fight, dodge, or sometimes get stuck against aggressive rats, drones flying around town, human beings who kill animated toys, and other aggressive toys that don't serve the benevolent lord Mr. M. Sometimes you have to use parts of the toy that were killed to survive.WEAVERACTIVE team is planning KEEP OUT to be playable for about 4 hours when playing normally.  The animals at Devota Hill are vicious for some reason.Dogs roam the town with their leash loose and rats guard the aisle swaying. They don’t let you stay moving. The players can run at high speed and avoid areas where animals cannot enter. Of course, there are ways to distract and pass quietly. It is early to say, you are safe if you’ve avoided the wild animals!There are drones navigating small gaps through the buildings of Devota Hill. The drone stuns the toy with a powerful laser, dragging it away from a terrifying human being, or even letting a giant human know the location of the toy.         An announcement surprised the worldIn 2035, a remarkable presentation begins at a press conference held in the hall of Humath Science.INC  "" Benjamin Gunn: We've opened up a new era of RIoT, beyond the age of the traditional IoT. Artificial intelligence applied to our new RIoT technology is not the intelligence of ""artificial"" but the intelligence of the ""real"" that acts autonomously.  Through sufficient research of Humath laboratory...."" Since the release of HumathScience, forces opposed to having intelligence have sparked protests around the world against RIoT systems, and Humath Science has announced that the intelligence applied to the RIoT system is not equipped with any network devices, and that accidents that occur in the mismatch between humanity and RIoT's goals, as shown in sci-fi films, will never happen, nor will they harm humans or any other creatures.Despite HumathScience's ongoing announcement that there are enough devices to respond to all possible problems and variables, the RIo system's counter-protest never stopped, and humath science agreed to gradually expand the range of things from small  toys under the control of HumathScience, with the consent of the villagers of Devota Hill near its laboratory. Live moving toysHumath Science's RIoT system has been successfully realized even protester are still doubts and worries about it. Intelligent toys were not violent at all as studied/planned by Humath science, especially because they were favorable to humans and had no uncontrol matters are existed over them, so the villagers happily adapted to the coexistence of living with moving toys.The children were enthusiastic. They thought that their favorite toys are alive and moving!The toys have become friends with pure children in the form of their own games, anime, and cartoon series. Things that shouldn't have happenedWorld was seeing to the positive effects of RIoT technology, where all the inhabitants of the village were satisfied with no accidents. One day, explosion sounded came out from the outskirts of Devota Hill, armed men began take over the village. Their purpose is only one thing: the interruption of the RIoT system and the disposal of all objects with the RIoT system.The terrorists relentlessly pressed HumathScience's research institute, and their actions were out of control, including taking the people of Devota Hill hostage. There was only one way to stop them, but Humath Science strongly responded that the idea of scrapping toys with the RIoT system is like murder.As a result, devota Hill, a conflict between mercenaries and terrorists in private military enterprises under Humath Science, has become like a battlefield. Contrary to HumathScience's publication, villagers who were threatened with survival were forced to kill toys with RIoT systems to survive.KEEP OUT tells the story of Mr. M, the monarch of toys that survived the mercy killing spree. What will happen next among Humath Science, villagers, terrorists, and toys?       (Animation such as ""Fairy Cake,"" ""Moonlit"" and ""Escape from Features!"" in the description only exists in KEEP OUT’s worldview.) Mr.MMr. M. is a benevolent monarch character from the famous fairy tale series <Fairy Cake>.Mr.M  is a sixth-generation figure that appeared in Fairy Cake: Beyond the Edge, one of the many-designed figures for generations. ""You should bless but not curse those who persecute you.""Episode 7 <Fairy Cake : Beyond the edge>   NocturneNocturne is a mysterious toy. He is not even attacked by drones for some reason. He only appeared briefly in the animated series ""Who are you?"" in the 23rd episode of Moonlit, but he gained huge popularity because of his strong character.  CPT. JamesCPT. James is a brave and vicious pirate captain in <Escape from pirates!>! This is the first figure in <Escape from pirates!> series. As a vicious pirate captain, he doesn't like a benevolent monarch Mr. M. “What sort of king hides in his castle while his men die for him?”Episode 12 <Escape from pirates!>    WolfWolf, who follows Mr.M well, is a dog character from <Fairy Cake: Sunday Morning>.A stupid but Wolf pretends to not be stupid at Mr.M's side.A limited-edition figure released at a famous fast food restaurant as a Christmas event.  SOMEESOMEE is a desert fox character who lives in snowfields and became the president of children around the world on an online video streaming site. He is currently a member of Humath Science's marketing department and is active as a representative character in humath science public relations. In addition to the toys introduced, a variety of toys are featured throughout Devota Hill. Most of them were killed by humans, but each surviving toy plays an important role, and it can help Mr.M or be hostile.       There are religious facilities that can be a relief for toys that are always threatened with survival.There is a religious facility prepared for toys always threatened their lives.The lights from the cellophane stained glass give Devota Hill's toys peace of mind.Made from remodeling boxes of famous couriers, it also has paper chairs made by toys.  Exercise is a really important factor for toys who spend most of their time indoors.Under the guidance of the trainer ""Wrestler"", who is famous for toys, the toys work hard against external threats. The bathtub of an abandoned house has been transformed into a deep sea. Most of the time, no one go around except for a scuba toy who is looking for usable parts and treasures. Maybe players can find helpful items or clues. Vivarium where the lizards were raised, the outrageous dinosaur figures lives only.With its powerful resin, it's hard to survive if you're bitten by this dinosaur figure. The abandoned freezer frozen as like a snowfield. Maybe you'll encounter a polar bear figure!  Devota Hill is made up of interesting environments created by the coexistence of humans and toys.Mr.M is threatened or helped in this environment. You are the lord of toys. With all your toys paying attention to you, think only about salvaging the world of threatened toys!  We are trying to express the effects of light sources, liquids, fire, rain, snow, and hair as natural and realistic as possible by actively utilizing Physically Based Rendering.A rat that threatens Mr. M moves as fast as a real mouse and learns the information around it.Weaveractive team emphasizes the realistic effects of environmental factors such as the surface of the character that gets wet in the rain, trace left over the sticking snow, snow layered on the surface.          KEEP OUT will distribute through STEAM (Valve Inc.) with the PC platform as a priority.After the release of the PC version, it will also be released on console devices such as PS4 and XBOX.

</div></div>","""Anche i rifiuti hanno un’anima, anche i rifiuti meritano una seconda vita.""
TRASH GAME è il gioco associato al lungometraggio d’animazione Trash, che verrà distribuito nelle sale Italiane ad Aprile. Il progetto è connotato da una forte componente educativa, l’intento principale è quello di consentire all’utente di abituarsi alla divisione sistematica dei rifiuti domestici seguendo le corrette regole del riciclo. 



Scatole, bottiglie di plastica, lattine, spazzatura. Abbandonate in strada, nei mercati, sotto i ponti. Ignorati da chiunque. Inanimati. Finché non cala notte...
Slim è una scatola di cartone rassegnata al suo destino, il suo amico Bubbles è una bottiglia di plastica. Slim non crede più a nulla, neanche alla leggenda della Piramide Magica: un luogo mitico in cui è possibile per i rifiuti avere una seconda vita. 
L’arrivo di Spark, una scatola diversa da tutti gli altri rifiuti, trascinerà Slim e Bubbles in un’avventura fantastica che cambierà le loro vite per sempre.  

In un periodo storico come questo, è il momento di cercare soluzioni che incoraggino un cambiamento radicale nello stile di vita, educando ad un consumo consapevole e al corretto smaltimento dei rifiuti ovunque nel mondo.
Nel film d’animazione Trash abbiamo dato vita ad eroi di plastica, carta, vetro ed ogni altra tipologia di materiale (riciclabile e non).   
Il film è un forte strumento per sensibilizzare il pubblico sul tema, ma volevamo di più. Trash Game ci è sembrata pertanto una coerente continuazione del nostro progetto, dandoci la possibilità di influenzare i comportamenti quotidiani delle persone in modo interattivo educandole attivamente al corretto smaltimento dei rifiuti domestici.
In altre parole: se il film Trash rappresenta la vetrina sull’importanza del tema, il gioco assolve alla funzione prettamente educativa, attraverso un sistema di intrattenimento.


Al giocatore viene chiesto di posizionare nei corretti cassonetti il materiale da riciclare che verrà poi accumulato e riutilizzarlo nel CENTRO DEL RICICLO per creare nuovi oggetti e personaggi del film.  Inserendo nel macchinario del riciclo i materiali raccolti nella sezione PLAY sarà possibile creare nuovi oggetti e personaggi del film. Per produrli il giocatore dovrà seguire ricette specifiche, che verranno sbloccate accumulando i materiali nella sezione PLAY.  Qui in SUNSET ALLEY verranno messi a disposizione sfondi originali del film Trash. Posizionando i personaggi del film e gli oggetti creati nel CENTRO DEL RICICLO, l’utente avrà la possibilità di creare scene personalizzate e farne uno screenshot da condividere con gli amici.   È la sezione educativa del gioco dove verranno fornite informazioni sui materiali riciclabili e sul corretto smaltimento dei rifiuti. Qui sono raccolti i vari simboli riportati su oggetti e imballaggi di uso comune. Selezionando un simbolo (o il materiale a cui si riferisce) sarà possibile conoscerne l’origine e la modalità di recupero. Si potranno inoltre trovare curiosità sul riciclo, iniziative positive da tutto il mondo, suggerimenti e molto ancora! La Al-One è una casa di produzione audiovisiva in cui è centrale lo studio di animazione diretto da capi reparto provenienti dalle più grandi realtà internazionali dell’industria cinematografica. Il nostro scopo è quello di creare una realtà del tutto nuova nel panorama creativo europeo, che produca contenuti di altissima qualità soprattutto per il mercato internazionale.  Sotto la guida del fondatore dell’azienda, Alan Vele, la Al-One è diventata un’officina per registi, scrittori, disegnatori, musicisti, professionisti del VFX, animatori ed artisti in genere. La crescita è stata naturale fino a costituire un epicentro creativo unico nel suo genere dove sviluppare prodotti di alto profilo in un ambiente professionale che prende spunto dalle logiche della famiglia.  

Anche se non dovessimo raggiungere il budget richiesto, Trash Game sarà distribuito tra fine Marzo ed Aprile 2020. Provvederemo ad autofinanziare la restante parte del progetto, per essere certi che il nostro lavoro possa continuare.
Abbiamo preso l’impegno di dare vita a questo progetto e non ci fermeremo fin quando non sarà completato. Questa somma ci permetterà di rimanere indipendenti e fedeli ai nostri obiettivi principali.  
Tutto ciò che riusciremo ad ottenere grazie a voi, verrà impiegato esclusivamente per sviluppare Trash Game come segue:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello world! My name is Jeremy Gann, many years ago I decided to take a leap of faith and went out on my own to create custom fabricated plastic cases to house retro/classic console games for myself, I shared my creations with the world...  and it has taken me on a wonderful journey filled with great people and amazing game collections! The ""Old-School Gamer"" community is truly filled with heartfelt men and women! :) </p>
<p>As the game cases have grown over the years, so have the community's requests for new cases to be born into the world. One of the collections that has constantly come up in conversations is the Virtual Boy collection.   So! Let's make this game case a reality together!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550899868/clwkvle44dnbkwf5sosp.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>To the Specifics! </h3>
<p>So! The largest hurdle these cases have is the mold cost. All our cases are created with Plastic Mold Injection. We use Steel Molds, which produce the cleanest, sharpest, end product. The plastic we use as well is premium high quality ""PP"" plastic. (True colors, no odor, a quality plastic that you would expect from a good, sturdy, game case.)</p>
<p>This Campaign is set at $15,000; This will cover the mold creation plus the first production run.</p>
<p>If for some reason this campaign's contributions are on the low-end we will keep everyone in the loop! We will not be touching these funds until to are ready to take these cases into production!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550902191/noy9yqtuo0vgbrrbirmg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello world! My name is Jeremy Gann, many years ago I decided to take a leap of faith and went out on my own to create custom fabricated plastic cases to house retro/classic console games for myself, I shared my creations with the world...  and it has taken me on a wonderful journey filled with great people and amazing game collections! The ""Old-School Gamer"" community is truly filled with heartfelt men and women! :) 
As the game cases have grown over the years, so have the community's requests for new cases to be born into the world. One of the collections that has constantly come up in conversations is the Virtual Boy collection.   So! Let's make this game case a reality together!


To the Specifics! 
So! The largest hurdle these cases have is the mold cost. All our cases are created with Plastic Mold Injection. We use Steel Molds, which produce the cleanest, sharpest, end product. The plastic we use as well is premium high quality ""PP"" plastic. (True colors, no odor, a quality plastic that you would expect from a good, sturdy, game case.)
This Campaign is set at $15,000; This will cover the mold creation plus the first production run.
If for some reason this campaign's contributions are on the low-end we will keep everyone in the loop! We will not be touching these funds until to are ready to take these cases into production!

Hi everyone. We’re Denis and Lazar, founders of FASTED and we’re delighted to show you the first trailer of the game we’ve created. FASTED is not just about cars and racing, it's about how you can unite with your friends and bring your friendship to a whole new level, by simply playing and having fun. We are a team of developers joint under RAGASOFT that is constantly striving to produce the highest quality work for each and every project. It’s important for us to build a relationship with each of our players—the more we know about you, what you like, and what you love, the better we can improve the game and add cool features you would love to play. We have a world-class design and development team that brings ideas to life. First and foremost, we’re professionals. But we believe a key part of being a professional is enjoying the work that we do. We make it a point to invite a random player to our offices once a month so we can get an actual feedback that would help us improve the game. We’re very proud of the culture here at RAGASOFT, and it spills into the work we do for our players. 



RAGASOFT has been producing FASTED since 2014. We are a team of 11 people dedicating every-breath of their body to release the beta version of the game. Our team is currently separated on three vital parts that drive the development. 
Denis Saidov, the Founder of FASTED, is the Art Director and Head of the Web Designers' Team, which make sure that every-single illustration is as closest as possible to the reality.
Lazar Georgiev, the Co-Founder of FASTED, is the Technology Director & Head of the Web Developers' Team, which make sure that every-single line of code works as efficient as the gear-shifting of your car.
Ivan Georgiev is the Lead Tester & Head of the Testers' Team, which make sure that every-single part of the game turn its ignition right away, without any glitches and security breaches.
  


 
First of all, we have chosen the Euro currency because we live in Europe and it makes things much easier for us from
a bureaucratic standpoint. Apart from this, 6,000€ is the amount that we believe would help us make the game with the highest quality as possible and bring it to
the crowd. Why do we need them?

A truly great game is ultimately defined by the integration of its features and design. And that's why we are focusing on creating the very-best design and illustrations, in order to define a truly singular user experience for our players.
Your every-day life is extremely dynamic and what we'd love to bring your joy everywhere with you on your smartphone, tablet or any other portable device. In order to do so our team is working on developing iOS, Android and Windows Phone applications.





As the game has the very-best security, it's truly a challenge to find someone who'll be able to hack it and find the breaches into the code. That's why we will hire white-hack-hackers to track and eliminate possible breaches.

One of the final parts of the development of the game are the additional expenses for VPS servers and other software solutions that would significantly smooth your gameplay experience, through the world of FASTED!

It's also played in most parts of the world, so if you search the popular app stores for Ludo, you're likely to find almost a dozen versions of the game. But the rules differ from country to country, and there's nowhere to download a Ludo game that plays with the Nigerian rules! That's where we come in. We have been working on this game for a while, and before the end of the year 2015, we can have a Nigerian-themed Ludo game on iPads, iPhones, Android devices and Windows 10 devices.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441543725/rhlhsd7fxto9xlfrwpig.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><strong>What we need</strong>:
 The game isn't too large, we have covered the cost of all the art work,
 modelling, music and programming. We need at least $1,000 for two 
things right now:  to keep the game's servers running and to run a small marketing campaign in Nigeria. This game was made with Nigerians in 
mind, and it won't be any good if the game is out but no one has heard 
about it, so the few people who have the game can't find anyone to play 
against online.<br/><br/><p><strong>Breakdown</strong>: We will be using the same server engine that powers games like <a href=""armello.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Armello</a>, the <a href=""https://www.photonengine.com/en/Turnbased/Pricing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Photon cloud engine</a>. With modest to medium size traffic, the server's 
will only cost $65, but if the game is more successful than we 
anticipate, we'll need to scale up, and that would cost about $65 
monthly. With $390, we're sure we won't have server problems for at 
least 6 months. The rest of the money will go into Indiegogo fees and 
marketing the game on Nigerian channels. If we are unable to meet or at 
least come close to the $1,000 goal, we will spend the money only on 
servers, and market the game only through social media.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong>:
 Depending on how much you give, you could get anything from an ad-free 
version of the game on your preferred mobile app store (App Store, 
Playstore and Windows Store only) to actually putting ads of your 
products in our game. You could also help shape the game by having 
insider access to the closed beta, the developer's blog, or the 
developer's audio and video podcasts. We may even throw in some limited 
edition Illuminare Games Studios merchandise.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441543759/fvdwgihll2qt1axgroch.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong>:
 You're not just helping us build one game, you're helping us build a 
game studio. If this first game succeeds, we will be able to focus on 
much larger projects. Every member of Illuminare Game Studios is a real 
gamer, and we have a collective passion for creating awesome gaming 
experiences, including some that can educate without compromising 
entertainment, but we may never achieve these dreams without your help. 
This isn't about making a great Nigerian game. This is about creating a 
great entertainment company!</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong>:
 Honestly, the biggest risk we can foresee is the game becoming much 
more successful than we anticipate, till it gets to the point that we 
can't handle the server costs. If this happens, we may have to shut the 
online section of the game down temporarily until we can get some more 
funds to power the servers. Other than that, the only other challenge 
may be bugs and other issues slowing down our development process so 
that we can't complete the game by October 2015. In this case, the game 
will remain in beta for a few more months until it's ready for launch. Also note that the game is still in development and the screenshots shown here are likely to change before the final product launches. We may also add new features or change some of those we originally intended to include. We're even thinking of making a 3D view of the board.<br/></p>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help</strong>:
 You may not be able to contribute any money to this project, but you 
can help spread the word. Tell your friends about it by social networks,
 talk about it on internet forums, or tell your friend's dad who owns a 
company that may be interested in sponsoring. It will make a big 
difference, and you'll be helping us start on the path towards our 
bigger dreams. Thanks!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441543850/lkmybkxvnccxtha0rbi3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441544118/kpgeeo0fwbkvdnlimgi4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>UPDATE</b>: We're toying with the idea of using stick men to represent the Ludo pieces in a 3D board.

mind, and it won't be any good if the game is out but no one has heard 
about it, so the few people who have the game can't find anyone to play 
against online.Breakdown: We will be using the same server engine that powers games like Armello, the Photon cloud engine. With modest to medium size traffic, the server's 
will only cost $65, but if the game is more successful than we 
anticipate, we'll need to scale up, and that would cost about $65 
monthly. With $390, we're sure we won't have server problems for at 
least 6 months. The rest of the money will go into Indiegogo fees and 
marketing the game on Nigerian channels. If we are unable to meet or at 
least come close to the $1,000 goal, we will spend the money only on 
servers, and market the game only through social media.
What you get:
 Depending on how much you give, you could get anything from an ad-free 
version of the game on your preferred mobile app store (App Store, 
Playstore and Windows Store only) to actually putting ads of your 
products in our game. You could also help shape the game by having 
insider access to the closed beta, the developer's blog, or the 
developer's audio and video podcasts. We may even throw in some limited 
edition Illuminare Games Studios merchandise.
The Impact:
 You're not just helping us build one game, you're helping us build a 
game studio. If this first game succeeds, we will be able to focus on 
much larger projects. Every member of Illuminare Game Studios is a real 
gamer, and we have a collective passion for creating awesome gaming 
experiences, including some that can educate without compromising 
entertainment, but we may never achieve these dreams without your help. 
This isn't about making a great Nigerian game. This is about creating a 
great entertainment company!
Risks and Challenges:
 Honestly, the biggest risk we can foresee is the game becoming much 
more successful than we anticipate, till it gets to the point that we 
can't handle the server costs. If this happens, we may have to shut the 
online section of the game down temporarily until we can get some more 
funds to power the servers. Other than that, the only other challenge 
may be bugs and other issues slowing down our development process so 
that we can't complete the game by October 2015. In this case, the game 
will remain in beta for a few more months until it's ready for launch. Also note that the game is still in development and the screenshots shown here are likely to change before the final product launches. We may also add new features or change some of those we originally intended to include. We're even thinking of making a 3D view of the board.
Other ways you can help:
 You may not be able to contribute any money to this project, but you 
can help spread the word. Tell your friends about it by social networks,
 talk about it on internet forums, or tell your friend's dad who owns a 
company that may be interested in sponsoring. It will make a big 
difference, and you'll be helping us start on the path towards our 
bigger dreams. Thanks!UPDATE: We're toying with the idea of using stick men to represent the Ludo pieces in a 3D board. We haven't decided yet how to color code the stick men so that they don't blend in with the board. Maybe we'll leave them plain white, but they'll wear hats to show what team they're on?",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Keep in mind the game was set up for android aspect ratios and touchscreen but for this demo specifically uses keyboard controls and the buttons have been hidden. The demo will be available within a day of this launch.
  What We Need & What You Get


  I will require $800 for android and ios license, $25 for submission fees for google play and $100 for apple store, and $100 for server CCU usage to start. As the game will be free their will be ad's which will fund the remaining required CCU usage.
 I designed this game to capture the attention of those who love interactive game mechanics such as: Zip line, Grappling hook/swing, Ninja Stars, Smoke bombs, Explosive Vials, Double Jump, Wall Climb etc.
 If I am unable to obtain the required  amount for the license and submission fee's the funds will be still used for assistance in me covering the remaining amount, though this will set back release to a later date.
    The Impact


   I designed this game to give the player a quick yet enjoyable experience in which he or she can become the master, battling against oppenets multiple opponents.
 The network was designed to take minimal time for finding a appropriate game with no work from the player. The match's will have a max player count of 4.
 The game was also made to focus on player creation and customization. Each player will be able to create a character through procedural generation and height displacement to alter hair, face features, and colors for all.    




Risks & Challenges    The only challenge will be to obtain the license and ccu usage expense. This will allow for the game to be available on the market. As all the systems have been checked for functionality and I am happy with the results.
 If I am unable to obtain the funds i need to obtain the license and ccu usage expense. I will have to delay the submission and release. Though this project will come to play no matter if it is sooner or later.

<p><b>Qu'est-ce
que les joueurs vont jouer ?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Pour
ceux qui possèdent d'ores et déjà le livret d'introduction, il est
tout à fait normal de se demander ce que l'on va pouvoir interpréter
clairement. A fortiori davantage si l'on ne le possède pas.
L'univers se pose dans un cadre bien fermé, contrôlé par
l'Institution et ses administrateurs, véritable dirigeants de
quartiers des cités, oeuvrant pour un administrateur général, tous
pour le bien de l'Institution. En conséquences, le sentiment
ressenti laisse apprécier une vie monotone, les jours se suivent et
se ressemblent. En toute honnêteté, la vie de Frodon ne
semblait-elle aussi si morose ? Le petit scénario du kit
d'introduction donne la possibilité aux joueurs de voir un peu plus
clairement surtout le système de jeu et le fait de jouer en binôme
(car oui c'est bel et bien un binôme qui joue le duo humain –
daemon et non pas un unique joueur!). Une fois le livre de base en
main, les joueurs pourront alors créer leurs binômes, tout en ayant
la possibilité de créer des personnages particuliers (en cas de
joueurs impairs) et commencer l'aventure grâce au scénario de
départ dont la suite se trouvera dans le livret de l'Institution,
puis les campagnes. Ces personnages verront leur vision du monde
bouleversée, et devront malgré eux faire des choix cruciaux, à
savoir poursuivre leur quête de la vérité mêlée de danger ou
bien retourner vers le monde bien encadré et monotone de
l'Institution.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>L'originalité
de Daemon ?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Comme
énoncé plus haut, le binôme humain – daemon va être joué par
un binôme de joueur. Les deux victimes se réunissent pour faire
leur création de perso et déterminent en premier lieu lequel va
jouer l'humain et l'autre la daemon. La relation entre les deux
entités est la plus forte existante connue, une réelle synergie au
cours des aventures et des mésaventures, et elle sera mis à mal
lors de confrontations ou à cause de l'éloignement. Le choix de la
race du daemon lors de la création est relativement importante car
si le daemon matérialise la conscience et l'âme de son humain, il
représente de plus le potentiel inné de l'humain tel un aigle royal
pour un leader en sommeil, une hyène mâle pour un humain plutôt
soumis se complaisant dans un cadre matriarcale, un ours pour un
humain rustre et solitaire. Ajouté à cela que le daemon permet un
jugement inconscient par les autres humains. Admettons que deux
personnes se croisent dans une ruelle et se toise tout en percevant
le daemon de chacun, il est naturel que l'appréciation ne sera pas
la même envers un daemon rhinocéros et un daemon canard.</p>
<p>Concernant
les daemons, des capacités utilisables sans compter, apportent
quelques petits bonus dans le jeu dans des domaines diverses, que ce
soit pour passer un obstacle, dévier une attaque, déjouer la mort
ou être sûr de trouver de quoi se nourrir.</p>
<p>Cela
amène aux risques encourus par le binôme et les conséquences sur
chacun. Si l'une des deux entités est touchée, l'autre le perçoit
automatiquement et subit une part minime des dégâts, et plus les
points de vie diminuent, plus l'autre adoptera un comportement
insensé motivé par la survie du binôme.</p>
<p>Si
le daemon meurt, l'humain sombre alors dans un coma irréversible. Si
l'humain meurt, le daemon s'effrite et disparaît instantanément.</p>

</p>
<p>Concernant
le système de jeu, il est composé de 3 caractéristiques
principales et une série de caractéristiques secondaires
(compétences) et enfin des compétences métiers, uniquement pour
l'humain. Si les compétences prennent leurs sources dans les
caractéristiques principales lors des jets de dés par exemple un
humain qui a 4 en physique et 3 en dextérité et qui souhaite faire
une action athlétique qui sort de son ordinaire, il lancera donc 7
dés et tentera d'obtenir des combinaisons de lettres ( doublons,
sextuples voire « daemon »). le niveau de la compétence
ne peut dépasser le niveau de la caractéristique principale
associée, comme dans l'exemple dextérité ne pourra dépasser 4.<br/>le

ensuite dans d'autres jdrs.</p>
<p>Les

l’Institution, un mouvement religieux. Dans ce monde, les artisans sont 
les plus respectés, les scribes et instituteurs maîtrisent l’art 
littéraire, mais chacun se concentre sur la place qu’il occupe dans 
cette société aux us et coutumes bien encadrés par l’Institution et ses 
administrateurs. La lumière bleue, inépuisable, est la source d’énergie

Travel times between the planets were still long and space travel ever treacherous. However, a new technology was developed, one that promised to change everything – two colossal gates, constructed between Earth and Mars.<br/><br/>These gates represented the cutting edge of scientific research, capable of creating stable wormholes between the planets. While the gates promised to dramatically reduce the cost and time of space travel, concerns were raised over the instability of the technology. In spite of these concerns the project was pushed through in order to have the gates ready for the start of the New Year, a momentous event that marked the beginning of the new century and it was hoped, a new era for humanity.<br/><br/>Tragedy struck on the eve of the New Year. While each gate was powered up successfully, it was not long before the gates began emitting increasingly powerful waves of gravitational energy. The effects were devastating: all ships and stations in the vicinity of each gate were crushed in an instance. Those further away suffered less damage but the immense gravitational forces soon caused the gates themselves to collapse. Within minutes, Earth, the Moon and even Mars began to disintegrate.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490400444/nzoa7m9zdv22ylcbllyp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After a while the anomaly became unstable, and collapsed in a violent explosion. The wave of destruction it left behind was unimaginable. The Earth, and Mars were no longer habitable, and the space around was filled with massive debris fields. The ships, which survived this apocalyptic event were now left stranded, and many of them did not have the facilities to survive more than a few hours.</p><p>However, a glimmer of hope remained. Important data from the event was shared throughout the Solar system. This valuable information might be used to develop new technological breakthroughs. There were still surviving smaller colonies like the Europa Science, and Mining Colony near Jupiter, and many smaller station colonies around the asteroid belts beyond Mars. Normally, the majority of these colonies relied on the central planets. Moreover, the communication network collapsed after the disaster.

<li>
<strong>Trade Convoys &amp; Stations : </strong>Trade convoys are cargo ships with several escorting ships working together to defend what they have. They are not friendly, and will shoot on sight. They will provide good loot for those that are brave enough to take them on, and survive. While stations will exist in the actual game, these stations are not mobile, so their only chance is to be neutral to any new arrivals, and trade to survive.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fighters &amp; Hangars :</strong> Fighters' expansion will introduce hangars into the ship building, and crew members' manning fighters. For this feature, the editor will also be modified to allow the design of fighters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Factions &amp; Pirate Gangs :</strong> Pirates are active small, and medium attack ships roaming, and looking for targets of opportunity. There are three planned factions, inspired from the <strong>TV-Series The Expanse</strong>. The factions will give you access to the bookmarks, which mark out faction stations nearby.</li>
<li>
<strong>Instanced Multiplayer :</strong> Lost Sol is actually designed to be integrated into a multiplayer game with ships easily packed, and shared. Aside from that, the multiplayer in Lost Sol can work in multiple models.<ul>
<li>
<strong>Co-op</strong> <strong>: </strong>Host plays the captain, while the clients take direct control over one or several crew members.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fleet-op : </strong>The host player, and every client connected will play with separate ships. The ships will be able to trade, and support each other depending on the host's settings.</li>

The crew needs to explore the remnants of humanity to improve their chances of survival. In order to achieve this, you need to research new technologies, scavenge, mine resources, manage your crew, and rescue other survivors, sometimes even dismantle parts of your own ship in an effort to keep your ship afloat.Throughout the game, you need to make careful decisions how to build your ship, and manage your crew. 
 The StorylineBy year 2499 humanity had extended its reach to the Moon and Mars, with a network of stations spread throughout the solar system, each serving their own purpose. Travel times between the planets were still long and space travel ever treacherous. However, a new technology was developed, one that promised to change everything – two colossal gates, constructed between Earth and Mars.These gates represented the cutting edge of scientific research, capable of creating stable wormholes between the planets. While the gates promised to dramatically reduce the cost and time of space travel, concerns were raised over the instability of the technology. In spite of these concerns the project was pushed through in order to have the gates ready for the start of the New Year, a momentous event that marked the beginning of the new century and it was hoped, a new era for humanity.Tragedy struck on the eve of the New Year. While each gate was powered up successfully, it was not long before the gates began emitting increasingly powerful waves of gravitational energy. The effects were devastating: all ships and stations in the vicinity of each gate were crushed in an instance. Those further away suffered less damage but the immense gravitational forces soon caused the gates themselves to collapse. Within minutes, Earth, the Moon and even Mars began to disintegrate.After a while the anomaly became unstable, and collapsed in a violent explosion. The wave of destruction it left behind was unimaginable. The Earth, and Mars were no longer habitable, and the space around was filled with massive debris fields. The ships, which survived this apocalyptic event were now left stranded, and many of them did not have the facilities to survive more than a few hours.However, a glimmer of hope remained. Important data from the event was shared throughout the Solar system. This valuable information might be used to develop new technological breakthroughs. There were still surviving smaller colonies like the Europa Science, and Mining Colony near Jupiter, and many smaller station colonies around the asteroid belts beyond Mars. Normally, the majority of these colonies relied on the central planets. Moreover, the communication network collapsed after the disaster. Only time will tell if the survivors are able to stay alive. 
 Gather ResourcesYou need resources to build your ship, but your equipment need also specific resources to function. Some of these resources can be looted, refined from asteroids, or even fabricated from raw materials.In Lost Sol, gathering resources can be accomplished in various ways. As long as your ship has enough storage, the collected resources will be stored in your ship, and they can be used to improve, and maintain the ship. 
 Control Your CrewAt its core, Lost Sol is a ship management game, and your crew is an essential part of this experience. Everything from building structures to exploring wrecks is done by commands given to your crew members.While playing the game, depending on your preferences, some commands can be given automatically. You can also manually assign or manage tasks by opening the action menus. Your new orders take priority over automatically given ones, ensuring that the next available crew member will follow your orders. You can also give direct orders to crew members by having them selected while giving your order.You have various options available, under different conditions, in your action menu. 
 Fight for SurvivalDepending on the difficulty setting in the start of your story, the game will generate events like asteroid storms, in different magnitudes, numbers, and speeds, which will test the capabilities of your ship, and crew. You will also face other ships, some of them will be wrecks, and might not have any active defenses, while the others will fight back. It's up to you to decide if you want to risk your ship for the rich spoils you may come across. 
 Structural AIWhen I look at a typical battleship, I am amazed by the amount of crew each ship requires to function, because essentially it is the crew that keeps the ship running. I wanted to create a dynamic ship where the crew is kept busy doing important things, like keeping the ship in a good condition, repairing or operating equipment. This turns the game into a small strategy game on itself.Lost Sol uses a special engine to assess each of your ships modules, checking information like how often they are maintained or how long they stayed damaged. It also makes calculations on how well the structure will continue to perform, if it is going to break down in a glorious explosion, or it will simply die down. It waits a handy crew member to tinker with it, because just like a neglected car is more likely to face serious problems sooner than a well maintained one, so is your ship.This mechanism deepens the relationship between the importance of having a good crew to complement your ship, and the struggles you will be facing when designing such a large ship. 
 Game ViewsLost Sol gameplay is divided into two different views, the ship view, and the space view. In the ship view, you will have a fixed view of your ship with building options enabled. You are able to plan new structures, control existing ones, manage your crew, and assign or control various tasks. In the space view, you will have an outside view of your ship, and you will be able to view objects all around, take direct control over weapons, and use special ship modules. 
 UI CustomizationBoth game views feature things like radar display (bottom right), and crew status (upper right), which can be toggled on/off. The ship status screen can be switch to full cargo view or both toggled off (upper left). 
 Icon Based InterfaceWhile designing the UI, I tried to avoid a text wall as much as possible. Consequently, I made most of the UI design from icons. Deeper ControlSome structures have unique panels for interacting with the structure controls. These can be anything from selecting what resources to refine, to picking new research projects. Every powered structure, which handles processes like research, refining, assembly etc. has an intuitive double hexagon design. This allows for quick overview of what's going on, how much of the progress is completed, and whether the structure is working, idle, or finished. Time DilationControl the speed of the game. Speed it up, or slow it down. Give your self the time to think. 
 Design, And ShareI think what makes a game great is also the power it gives to the players, who want to take it a step forward. Therefore, I made a powerful asset editor inside of the game for those, who want to have the core ship design experience.

For making file sharing easy for platforms like Steam workshop or forums, the editor has different options for importing, and exporting your designs in a single file format in JavaScript Object Notation. The players are able to present different starting challenges, and designs to show their skills, and techniques to the community.When you die in the game, what is left of your ship is saved into the Relic Schematics Library as a wreck, so you have a chance of coming across your old ships in new games.
 Is It Ready ?It has been a year since I started working on Lost Sol, and it is right now in the Pre-Alpha stage. At the end of this Indiegogo campaign we will enter the Alpha stage. Anyone, who has bought the game, or signed up for a backer tier above colonist, will be able to participate in the Alpha stage, and any update that happens afterwards. My goal is to grow our community, and make it possible for everybody to become a part of it by leaving their own personal marks on Lost Sol. I hope Lost Sol will become a great 2D spaceship survival game together with all of you.   
 Future PlansAs the game continues to develop, I want to improve the game content, add new features, and improve user experience with better audio, and art. These listed ideas below are subject to change as the project continues in Alpha stage, depending on the community response. The most demanded features will be prioritized.

More Structures : Increasing the variety of structures that can be built on the ship. 

Extensive Research : Discover new structure options, and improve the current ones.

Higher Tier Structures : More structure variations, which are tied to the research system.

Character Learning : Allowing your crew to learn skills as they do tasks over time.

Deep Characterization : Addition of traits for characters, and a backstory.

Limited Modding Support : Allowing for aspects of the game to be tuned, and changed.

Space Regions : Different properties for different regions of space, all the way to Europa.

Bookmarks : Similar to EvE-Online, can be used for marking out, and naming points of interest to return later.

Endgame Storyline : Completing the story arc for those who want to pursue it.

Your Imagination : Contact me by email, PM, comments, comment underneath game updates, comment under YouTube videos, make a Reddit post, share them in Steam, comment under blog posts about what you have in mind. This is not a one-way street, you will affect the development of Lost Sol with your feedback, and ideas. 
 
 Stretch GoalsThese goals will be worked on after the initial goals of the alpha stages are completed. These large-scale expansions will be unlocked depending on the total funds collected.Stretch goals will be active even after the campaign ends. When the campaign enters InDemand on Indiegogo.About Stretch Goals :

Trade Convoys & Stations : Trade convoys are cargo ships with several escorting ships working together to defend what they have. They are not friendly, and will shoot on sight. They will provide good loot for those that are brave enough to take them on, and survive. While stations will exist in the actual game, these stations are not mobile, so their only chance is to be neutral to any new arrivals, and trade to survive.

Fighters & Hangars : Fighters' expansion will introduce hangars into the ship building, and crew members' manning fighters. For this feature, the editor will also be modified to allow the design of fighters.

Factions & Pirate Gangs : Pirates are active small, and medium attack ships roaming, and looking for targets of opportunity. There are three planned factions, inspired from the TV-Series The Expanse. The factions will give you access to the bookmarks, which mark out faction stations nearby.

Instanced Multiplayer : Lost Sol is actually designed to be integrated into a multiplayer game with ships easily packed, and shared. Aside from that, the multiplayer in Lost Sol can work in multiple models.

Co-op : Host plays the captain, while the clients take direct control over one or several crew members.

Fleet-op : The host player, and every client connected will play with separate ships. The ships will be able to trade, and support each other depending on the host's settings.


 
 Campaign PerksName in Credits : We thank you for supporting us, and as part of our appreciation, your name will be forever in the credits of the game.Lost Sol [Alpha] Digital Copy : You will get the Alpha release of the game when its available in mid-2017, and if we are available in Steam, you will receive a Steam key for the game.Lost Sol [Pre-Alpha] - NOW : You will get the Pre-Alpha within about a week, and if we are available in Steam, you will receive a Steam key for the game.Name in Character Library : Your selected name, and surname will be placed into the character library, and you will have a chance to appear as a crew member or in any number of encounters, which can be tied to factions, and trade stretch goal.Your Ship in Official Game : Your ship will be part of the game, and it will have a chance to appear to others. If factions stretch goal is achieved, this will also include your character name (bio, and portrait if unlocked).Add Portrait, and Bio in Game : You can add a special character name, which will come with a special bio, and an unique portrait you will design.I will edit your picture to fit into this form of template to appear in the game, and make the background transparent if requested. If the Factions & Pirate Gangs stretch goal is achieved, your character has a chance of appearing as the captain of your submitted ship, or a random ship, belonging to one of the factions.Design an Official Station : When the official structures, which are intended for the Alpha release are completed, I will add your station into the game. The players will have a chance to find it, and fight against it. The stations can come in multiple forms, which you can decide (science/military/supply). This will also include trade stations, if the Trade Convoys & Stations stretch goal is achieved.Design a Module : Lost Sol building options will feature many different fictional modules for stations, asteroids, and spaceships. We will sit down, and talk about what kind of things we can add, just tell what you have in mind. The module must fit the narrative of the game.Design a Unique In-game Event : Space is scary, and we already have events like different varieties of asteroid storms, and ship encounters. You can also add to the dangers, or to the opportunities in this universe. We will talk together, and work out how your imagination can come to life.Become Part of the Storyline : This is a special event chain that leads to the Endgame Storyline. By becoming a secret deity you will be directly influencing what will happen in one of these chain missions. I will present the storyline I have planned, and we will decide how your influence will play out for the players. 
 Join the CrewAre you an artist with a burning passion for science fiction, talented, and looking for a possibility to make some awesome art, sounds, or soundtracks for Lost Sol ? If so, we should talk. I will use the Indiegogo funding to provide the players of Lost Sol the visual, and audio experience they deserve. I'm looking forward to hear from you.Multilingual Lost-SolIf you want to support the game by translating Lost Sol to your own language, you can translate the ""Res_Language_English"" file, and send it to me. I will add it into the game.

<p> </p>
<p>We want to keep this project clear for everyone supports us and this idea!<br/>That's why we will list everything we can't afford at our current situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>We're not a big team, just a few gaming friends (know each other since decades) are hyped about an amazing idea. We haven't got the man-power we need. And we need to work also.<br/>Thus we want to have the possibility to work 16/24h on this project!<br/><i>We're only ~6h/day viable at the moment :(</i>

What do you think happens when everyone is able to organize tournaments?<br/>Exactly! There will be many more events and maybe also weekend tournaments for every city out there!<br/>It may take time but we believe that gaming might get a profession as a soccer player is one.</p>
<p>We think everyone has got a passion and just needs to be able to make this passion into a profession. So why can soccer player survive (and even get rich) by just making what they love but gamer not even tho it is mostly the same! The one just needs the body, the other needs more the brain.. And while the organization and the society might be a problem, which the tournament organizer will solve. The other problem is you need a well fitting team! And ExaQueue will be created exactly for this purpose!<br/><strong>So get in action and help us make gaming what it should be!</strong></p>

Jetzt sind wir alle zusammen fokusiert an diesem Projekt und richtig aufgeregt in anbetracht an allen Funktionen die wir konzeptionell bereits ausgefeilt haben,welche in dieser kommende Software, vorrangig für den Desktop, beinhaltet werden.<br/><br/><strong>Um diese so kurz wie möglich zusammen zu fassen: </strong></p>

<div> <p>Um ehrlich zu sein: Wir werden ExaQueue so oder veröffentlichen. Irgendwann. Das ist auch der Punkt. Ich bin einfach viel zu gefesselt von diesem Konzept um von irgendetwas oder irgendjemandem vom Gegenteil überzeugt zu werden aber wir brauchen DICH um daraus wirklich DIE SPIELE SOFTWARE zu kreiren die Team-ExaQueue und unsere Fans mit und ausgetüftelt haben! Ohne dich kann dieses Vorhaben viele Jahre benötigen um endlich öffentlich gemacht zu werden. Vorallem um es so zu erschaffen, dass wir auch stolz sein können! Aber mit deinem Support wollen wir die App bereits im Frühjahr 2018 als open Alpha mit der Hauptfunktion der Spielersuche veröffentlichen! und keine sorge, denn ab diesem Punkt wird es uns auch viel leichter sein externe Gelder zu erhalten und spätestens im Sommer 2018 die Beta veröffentlichen können mit allen Funktionen die wir uns so ersehnen!<br/><br/>Und dieser unglaubliche support soll auch belohnt werden - garkeine Frage!<br/><br/>Gönn dir einen tieferen Einblick in die exklusiven Belohnungen für frühe Supporter des Traums namens ExaQueue auf unserer Website: <a href=""https://www.exaqueue.com/support-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ExaQueuePerks</a><br/>Wir sind uns sicher, dass sich da etwas für jeden <strong>echten Gamer </strong>tummelt!<br/>Aber was genau so wichtig ist, ist, dass du dieses Projekt teilst und damit auch anderen die Möglichkeit gibst die Zukunft des Gamings zu unterstützen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Aber was wollen wir eigentlich genau mit dem Support alles finanzieren?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Wir wollen dieses Projekt so transparent wie nur irgend möglich gestalten und listen damit alle Ausgaben auf, welche wir nicht aus unserer eigenen Tasche und der Sparskontis der Kindheit umsetzen können.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wir sind nur ein kleines Team aus begeisterten Kindheitsfreunden die sich diese Pläne zum Ziel gesetzt haben und arbeiten auch um unsere Mieten zu bezahlen. Deshalb wollen wir die Möglichkeit haben effektiv 16/24h am Tag an ExaQueue zu arbeiten. <br/><i>Momentan leider nur ~6h/Tag möglich :(</i>
</li>
<li>Um die Alpha, so perfektionistisch wie wir auch veranlagt sein mögen, dennoch schnell veröffentlichen zu können brauchen wir mehr man-power! <br/>Deswegen wollen wir ein kleines, grösseres Team zusammenstellen und vorallem unseren einzigen Programmierer etwas entlasten.</li>
<li>Obwohl wir unser Erspartes für Hardware und Software verwenden, so wollen wir dennoch reserven haben, sollten diese in unserem Dauerbetrieb schäden von sich tragen um sie auch ersetzen zu können. Ebenfalls müssen wir die Server auf die Menge an Usern vorbereiten und auch hier reserven haben, solltet ihr uns überaschen. ;)</li>
<li>Besonders in diesem Projekt ist das Marketing wichtig um gleich zu beginn einen Bekanntheitsgrad und Benutzerbasis auf zu bauen um nicht am schluss doch keinen perfekten Mitspieler für dich finden zu können! Oder möchtest du mit jemandem als ""perfektes Team"" gematched werden, der nicht mal deine Sprache(n) spricht? Wir haben zwar bereits unterstützung von einem Netzwerk zugesprochen bekommen, welches sich aber hauptsächlich im deutschschprachigem Raum aufhält. Und denkt doch nur mal einer an die armen Amerikaner und Nordafrikaner!</li>
</ol>
<p>Und das ist es schon! And that's it!<br/>Wir sind bereits ein breit und gut ausgebildetes Team mit Fähigkeiten in den meisten Bereichen die wir benötigen.<br/>Aber dennoch nicht komplett und wieso ein Projekt für die Community nicht mit der Community erschaffen?</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div> <h3>Und was ist das Weitreichendere Ziel von ExaQueue?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Du weisst ja bereits: Wir wollen die Gaming-Community so wie sie auch sein sollte und zwar vereint! Zocken macht einfach mir spass mit guten Freunden und wir wollen diese Art der Liebe und Zusammenkunft in der gesammten Community verbreiten!<br/>Aber das ist bei weitem nicht alles. Was denkst du passiert wenn jedem, egal mit welchen hintergründen, ermöglicht wird Turniere zu organisieren und gestalten?<br/>Genau! Es wird offensichtlich viel mehr Turniere in allen Spielen geben, egal ob Dorfturnier, Frauenturnier, Turnier der Neueinsteiger oder der Primarschüler! Gaming wird etabliert und immer mehr von der Gesellschaft akzeptiert und zwar als soziale interaktion mindestens genauso wie es auch Sport oder Filme sind! Denn Gaming, als interaktives entertainment, ist die Zukunfts des entertainments! So sehen wir das zumindest.. du auch?<br/>ExaQueue soll alles bieten um dieses Unterhaltungsmedium auf die neue Stufe zu führen!<br/><br/>Ps: Jetzt stell dir vor, wie das bei fortgeschrittenerem Virtual Reality ist? oder Augmented Reality? Es wird so viele unglaublich berauschende events geben aber dafür muss nicht nur die technische gegebenheit wachsen sondern unsere Community genau so!<br/>Und wenn du so denkst wie wir und ExaQueue genauso ersehnst wie wir:<br/><br/><strong>Mach es möglich und supporte! Jetzt direkt hier und/oder indem du es teilst und der öffentlichkeit mitteilst!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Danke im vorraus für jede Art der Unterstützung!</strong></p>

Aber mit deinem Support wollen wir die App bereits im Frühjahr 2018 als open Alpha mit der Hauptfunktion der Spielersuche veröffentlichen! und keine sorge, denn ab diesem Punkt wird es uns auch viel leichter sein externe Gelder zu erhalten und spätestens im Sommer 2018 die Beta veröffentlichen können mit allen Funktionen die wir uns so ersehnen!Und dieser unglaubliche support soll auch belohnt werden - garkeine Frage!Gönn dir einen tieferen Einblick in die exklusiven Belohnungen für frühe Supporter des Traums namens ExaQueue auf unserer Website: ExaQueuePerksWir sind uns sicher, dass sich da etwas für jeden echten Gamer tummelt!Aber was genau so wichtig ist, ist, dass du dieses Projekt teilst und damit auch anderen die Möglichkeit gibst die Zukunft des Gamings zu unterstützen!
 
 
Aber was wollen wir eigentlich genau mit dem Support alles finanzieren?
 
Wir wollen dieses Projekt so transparent wie nur irgend möglich gestalten und listen damit alle Ausgaben auf, welche wir nicht aus unserer eigenen Tasche und der Sparskontis der Kindheit umsetzen können.

Wir sind nur ein kleines Team aus begeisterten Kindheitsfreunden die sich diese Pläne zum Ziel gesetzt haben und arbeiten auch um unsere Mieten zu bezahlen. Deshalb wollen wir die Möglichkeit haben effektiv 16/24h am Tag an ExaQueue zu arbeiten. Momentan leider nur ~6h/Tag möglich :(

Um die Alpha, so perfektionistisch wie wir auch veranlagt sein mögen, dennoch schnell veröffentlichen zu können brauchen wir mehr man-power! Deswegen wollen wir ein kleines, grösseres Team zusammenstellen und vorallem unseren einzigen Programmierer etwas entlasten.
Obwohl wir unser Erspartes für Hardware und Software verwenden, so wollen wir dennoch reserven haben, sollten diese in unserem Dauerbetrieb schäden von sich tragen um sie auch ersetzen zu können. Ebenfalls müssen wir die Server auf die Menge an Usern vorbereiten und auch hier reserven haben, solltet ihr uns überaschen. ;)
Besonders in diesem Projekt ist das Marketing wichtig um gleich zu beginn einen Bekanntheitsgrad und Benutzerbasis auf zu bauen um nicht am schluss doch keinen perfekten Mitspieler für dich finden zu können! Oder möchtest du mit jemandem als ""perfektes Team"" gematched werden, der nicht mal deine Sprache(n) spricht? Wir haben zwar bereits unterstützung von einem Netzwerk zugesprochen bekommen, welches sich aber hauptsächlich im deutschschprachigem Raum aufhält. Und denkt doch nur mal einer an die armen Amerikaner und Nordafrikaner!

Und das ist es schon! And that's it!Wir sind bereits ein breit und gut ausgebildetes Team mit Fähigkeiten in den meisten Bereichen die wir benötigen.Aber dennoch nicht komplett und wieso ein Projekt für die Community nicht mit der Community erschaffen?

 
 Und was ist das Weitreichendere Ziel von ExaQueue?
 
Du weisst ja bereits: Wir wollen die Gaming-Community so wie sie auch sein sollte und zwar vereint! Zocken macht einfach mir spass mit guten Freunden und wir wollen diese Art der Liebe und Zusammenkunft in der gesammten Community verbreiten!Aber das ist bei weitem nicht alles. Was denkst du passiert wenn jedem, egal mit welchen hintergründen, ermöglicht wird Turniere zu organisieren und gestalten?Genau! Es wird offensichtlich viel mehr Turniere in allen Spielen geben, egal ob Dorfturnier, Frauenturnier, Turnier der Neueinsteiger oder der Primarschüler! Gaming wird etabliert und immer mehr von der Gesellschaft akzeptiert und zwar als soziale interaktion mindestens genauso wie es auch Sport oder Filme sind! Denn Gaming, als interaktives entertainment, ist die Zukunfts des entertainments! So sehen wir das zumindest.. du auch?ExaQueue soll alles bieten um dieses Unterhaltungsmedium auf die neue Stufe zu führen!Ps: Jetzt stell dir vor, wie das bei fortgeschrittenerem Virtual Reality ist? oder Augmented Reality? Es wird so viele unglaublich berauschende events geben aber dafür muss nicht nur die technische gegebenheit wachsen sondern unsere Community genau so!Und wenn du so denkst wie wir und ExaQueue genauso ersehnst wie wir:Mach es möglich und supporte! Jetzt direkt hier und/oder indem du es teilst und der öffentlichkeit mitteilst!
 
Danke im vorraus für jede Art der Unterstützung!

<p><strong>1. What is Match Queue?</strong></p>
<p>Match Queue is a new social platform geared towards League of Legends players, giving them the opportunity to connect with other players in the game as well as outside in the real world. </p>
<p><strong>2. How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>You start by filling out the form on the homepage and answering some basic questions to create your profile. After your account is created you can begin your search! Our search system will allow you to find other players local to your area using your zip code or within the same server. You can filter your search by rank, preferred lane, and more to narrow down potential duo partners.</p>
<p>Once you select someone’s profile you’re interested in you can hit the “Request to Play” button and send a brief message to that person. If they accept, you’ll be able to communicate back and forth to schedule a time to play together.</p>
<p><strong>3. How much does it cost to join?</strong></p>
<p>Match Queue is FREE to sign up!</p>
<p><strong>4. Why join Match Queue?</strong></p>
<p>There isn’t many matchmaking platforms that are as specific to League of Legends as we are. Our platform provides the chance for gamers to connect in many ways, whether you're looking to build a team, meet new friends or find someone with the skills to play with.</p>
<p><strong>5. How do I get started?</strong></p>
<p>We’re currently in the process of raising funds to begin the development of the site. We know not everyone is able to contribute financially but spreading the word of Match Queue to your friends and social media would be a HUGE help and very much appreciated. </p>

<p align=""justify"">The aim of the game is the defeat of the opponent by bringing him points of damage. The game cards are multi-function. There’s a special game that you can play with them, where you try and attack your opponent using the actual historical warriors that grace the front of the cards. They are also marked as a regular Poker deck of cards, so you can use them that way as well. Depending on what cards fall into your hands, and of course how well you use them, the outcome of the battle depends! Good cards are only 60% of success in the game and you should think qualitatively of your game strategy also!</p>
<p align=""justify"">Players attack each other in course. On what attack power has your card and what defence power has opponent's card depend whether or not the attacker can bring damage points to the defender. Dice will increase the power of attack and defence from 1 to 6. If attacker win in his turn, defender gain damage points. More damage points you will bring to the opponent - more chances to win the global battle before cards will end in the deck. Defender can choose what card will resist of the attacker card. It is better if it will be same era card (border color). If it will be another era's card, so attacker can add more attacking cards from same era and it will be more difficult for defender avoid damage points.</p>
<p align=""justify"">It will be double interesting to play in a jolly crowd as the most characters require some humorous actions from your opponents if you successfully win your battle using such card.</p>

Unfortunately not yet - in fact development & raising funds for the new game is not supposed to be the focus of this campaign.

<p>I made The Most Addicting Sheep Game because it was a game <i>I wanted to play</i>. I was playing a lot of Indie side-scrollers on Xbox with simple graphics and cool music, and it struck me that it would be super awesome if pressing a button to jump was synchronized to the beat of the music. I started mucking about with some code, got a prototype up and running, and was immediately hooked. The Most Addicting Sheep Game was born.</p>
<p>Since then, TMASG has received rave reviews on XBOX, iOS and Windows Phone 7 and now, it's finally time to get <i>EWE</i> running and jumping on Android. </p>
<p>But supporting this campaign is not just about getting TMASG onto Android. It's about keeping it there <i>and</i> keeping it alive on iOS as well. Two things have happened recently that I thought spelt the end for TMASG: Apple released iOS 9 which was not compatible with my code and Microsoft announced the retiring of the Xbox 360 Indie Games section. As a pet project with just one person in charge of everything, from coding to graphics and music, I did not think I would ever have the time again to make the necessary updates. But I am determined! I have been working hard on a new cross-platform version of the game which I've already submitted to Apple for approval (which should go live within a week or two) and which lays the groundwork for the Android port.</p>
<p>In short, your support will aid enormously in getting The Most Addicting Sheep Game onto Android as well as securing its future on iOS.</p>
<h3>Reviews for The Most Addicting Sheep Game</h3>
<p>Even though I've always personally thought TMASG is a great game, at the end of the day it was just a pet project and so I was somewhat surprised when multiple YouTube videos started popping up showing people playing it. And not just playing it, but raving about it. The iPhone port has had similarly positive feedback and the version for Windows Phone 7 won first prize in Microsoft’s Windows Phone Application Development competition in South Africa, my home country and, incidentally, the source for all sheep sounds you might hear while playing it.</p>
<p>Here are just a few of the nice things some wonderful people have said about it.</p>

<h3>The Unexpected Educative Aspect</h3>
<p>I created The Most Addicting Sheep Game as a <i>game.</i> The rhythm aspect, whilst arguably the most important feature of the game, was part of just that: a game. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to see reviews popping up from music teachers and music schools around the world praising TMASG for its ability to teach rhythm to young music students without them even realizing it. When Apple released iOS 9 and the game crashed on iPhone and iPad devices, it was the music teachers who started posting on the game's Facebook page asking when the update was coming out and telling me that their kids were devastated to lose a favorite music app.</p>
<p>I am absolutely thrilled that TMASG can provide fun and enjoyment and serve a useful purpose at the same time. I would love to develop this further in the future. If you're a music teacher and have ideas or feedback, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
<h3>Where Does the Money Go?</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help keep TMASG alive by both ensuring its continued existence on iOS as well as funding the port to Android.</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign will be used primarily in two ways. Some of the funds that I raise from this campaign will help pay for my time spent on porting TMASG to Unity. Because I believe in the project, I will continue to work on it whether I am able to raise the funds or not, but being successful in the campaign will allow me to focus my time on completing the task quickly.</p>
<p>Secondly, an Android port has always somewhat scared me due to the vast number of devices that are available with greatly differing specs, both in terms of screen dimension and processor capability. Despite being a pet project, it is of utmost importance to me to release a product of exceptionally high quality. To do that, I need to test it, and to test it a lot. I would like to spend some of the funds raised on test devices and emulators.</p>
<h3>Some Coding Challenges</h3>
<p>First and foremost, TMASG is a rhythm game. Side-scrollers are a dime-a-dozen on virtually every platform and while I think TMASG stands on its own two feet as a side-scroller, it's the musical timing of the actions to the beat that really sets it apart. And it seems such a simple idea to me now after creating the game that I've spent a lot of time wondering why more developers haven't created more of them. One of the reasons: <i>it's hard</i>.</p>
<p>Getting the images, the game logic and the music to all sync up perfectly turns out to be a rather complex, albeit fascinating, problem. From a technical point of view the pieces of hardware responsible for drawing things to the screen and for playing a sound run on different clocks and even the slightest temporary lag in one of them has a catastrophic effect on the synchronization. Each platform (Xbox, iPhone, etc.) handles these elements slightly differently, so each new port of TMASG so far has required re-solving the problem.</p>
<p>A second interesting challenge for me is that of player controls. When I created the game for Xbox, the player pushed buttons on the Xbox controller to perform various jump and roll actions. In time to the beat, of course. It was fun and challenging to play. And pushing buttons in time to the music felt <i>right</i>. When I ported the game to iOS it was important to me that it didn't just feel like a console game ported to a touch screen. A good touch screen game makes use of the touch screen! There are no buttons on a touch screen and creating the illusion of them sometimes just feels <i>wrong</i>. It took a lot of time and experimentation to settle on ""tap"", ""two finger tap"" and ""swipe"" as the replacement controls for the three actions in TMASG. But with these controls, TMASG feels like it <i>belongs</i> on a touch screen: playing it feels <i>right.</i> In retrospect it seems like such an easy and obvious choice, but such an important one. I've seen countless great console games turned into very average touch screen games because the developers simply emulated the buttons on the screen.</p>
<p>These challenges; the problems that require solving along the path to developing a game, are one of two primary reasons I love to make them and will continue to do so. The second reason? <i>You.</i> The person who plays them. If you'd like to support me in my campaign to keep The Most Addicting Sheep Game alive and get it onto Android, I thank you. If you've played it on Xbox or iOS or WP7 and enjoyed it, I thank you even more. And if you've never played it, check it out!</p>

I made The Most Addicting Sheep Game because it was a game I wanted to play. I was playing a lot of Indie side-scrollers on Xbox with simple graphics and cool music, and it struck me that it would be super awesome if pressing a button to jump was synchronized to the beat of the music. I started mucking about with some code, got a prototype up and running, and was immediately hooked. The Most Addicting Sheep Game was born.
Since then, TMASG has received rave reviews on XBOX, iOS and Windows Phone 7 and now, it's finally time to get EWE running and jumping on Android. 
But supporting this campaign is not just about getting TMASG onto Android. It's about keeping it there and keeping it alive on iOS as well. Two things have happened recently that I thought spelt the end for TMASG: Apple released iOS 9 which was not compatible with my code and Microsoft announced the retiring of the Xbox 360 Indie Games section. As a pet project with just one person in charge of everything, from coding to graphics and music, I did not think I would ever have the time again to make the necessary updates. But I am determined! I have been working hard on a new cross-platform version of the game which I've already submitted to Apple for approval (which should go live within a week or two) and which lays the groundwork for the Android port.
In short, your support will aid enormously in getting The Most Addicting Sheep Game onto Android as well as securing its future on iOS.
Reviews for The Most Addicting Sheep Game
Even though I've always personally thought TMASG is a great game, at the end of the day it was just a pet project and so I was somewhat surprised when multiple YouTube videos started popping up showing people playing it. And not just playing it, but raving about it. The iPhone port has had similarly positive feedback and the version for Windows Phone 7 won first prize in Microsoft’s Windows Phone Application Development competition in South Africa, my home country and, incidentally, the source for all sheep sounds you might hear while playing it.
Here are just a few of the nice things some wonderful people have said about it.
Xbox:
""8/10: Extremely simple, yet awesome, innocent and challenging."" - casuallyhardcore.com
Window Phone 7:
""★★★★★: Loved this on the Xbox, and it's even better with touch controls!"" - homr
""★★★★★: The addicting part is quite accurate. I cannot put it down. Very entertaining and it does reward practice."" - pty muscle oho
iOS:
""Simple to grasp, hard to master (★★★★★) One of the most enjoyable games I've played from the app store. Extra challenges (Infinity Bonus) and modes (Super Sheep Mode) keep you playing far past basic completion. Great game!"" - pugsinkayaks
""Great rhythm app (★★★★★) This app is fantastic to help anyone learning/playing a musical instrument to develop a good sense of rhythm. Have recommended to my students to purchase."" - bnapsbysandi

<p><b>Freak</b>: <i>An Instant Gaming App</i></p>
<p><b>F</b>reak is to introduce an <b>Instant Gaming</b> platform to the word. A wide range of games to be played with one and all on your phone book
just on a click. Freak is to break the hazardous ways of Gaming by logging in
via some social media sites revealing a lot of personal information online every
time a game is to be played. Freak offers login only via your contact number
and automatically adds everyone in your contact list to be able to play any
games with them. Freak is to simplify the entire gaming experience. One
time Login, chose the contact and start playing, indeed that simple. To make gaming more
interesting Freak also allows you to chat with your gaming partner or in a group
along with other unique features.</p>
<p>Freak was founded by 5 college pass-outs with the idea of
breaking the boredom involved in chatting. The founders once passed out college
went to be a part of the Silicon Valley in much reputed companies with a lot of
enthusiasm, just to realize it won’t last for long. Passtimes were spent only
by chatting with friends online that got boring everytime we ran out of topic.
When these coffee lovers, met one evening at a café, the idea of freak took
birth. The conversation was a regular one that involved how bored they were
with their jobs and that chatting was the only option to fill in the hours. The
co-founders, were all the cream of their own college and refused to fit it,
when they could stand out.</p>
<p>“The idea of freak literally freaked me out with the

<br/>
<p>One overwhelming part of freak is that it lets people play
games with anyone in their contact list. Freak unlike other Gaming
applications, is bringing a lot of games of different kinds together and at
your fingertips to be played with your friends and foes instantly. The hassled
process of logging in via Facebook or other social media to play an online game
is not only time consuming but also lets the game application access a lot of
personal data. In this context co-founder Jetty said “Some of us do not play
games only because of these registrations, authentications. We could not let
this same happen with Freak, thus the simplified option of playing games with
your contacts. Also, the chat has cool enough features to keep the user on the
application over other applications“</p><p>
</p><p>Every glory comes with great struggles and so does Freak.
Freak from its advent has been that dream that would not let its co-founders
sleep. Leaving jobs to get into start up may sound fancy but actually is not.
We have spent days in utter despair and run short of money all of the times;
the only thing that got us going was our belief on the application. Keeping the
money constraints aside, the technical difficulties faced were humongous in
nature too. The kind of features that we wanted to design Freak with were so
unique that technical feasibility was always a challenge. But we have never
compromised on our passion, and conveying the same to our investors so as to
make sure they invest in what they must believe in. Freak is a challenging
project but with most certainly change the face of instant gaming the moment it
is ready to be released. The idea of Freak has never been for once been
disliked by anyone, who understood the concept and the whole purpose of it.</p>

allow you to set a time period after which it automatically changes to the next

designed the idea of being able to tag a friend in your status on freak in
case, the status updated is specifically for someone (special). In freak, a
user needs to approve of him/her being added to a group instead of taking the
pain of leaving the group later.</p><p></p><p>                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454396210/y7elc7ej0fsbzvde6rlr.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 223.921px; height: 397px;""/></p><p>                                                    <i>Tagging in status bar</i><br/></p><br/>

<p><b>The vision and the purpose:</b></p>
<p>The strong clutching belief on the product
that its founders has on Freak is owing to the fact that it is a very
competitive product amongst all existing applications in the instant chatting
and gaming field and has a lot to offer. Features and benefits being offered by
Freak are quite unique in its own way when being offered by an instant gaming
application that also supports chatting and other unique features.</p>
<p><b>Challenges and risks:</b></p>
<p>Challenges being faced by Freak are majorly
technical challenges, since the features we are trying to bring into Freak are
unique in their own way and requires a lot of R&amp;D. “Checking of the
technical feasibility and implementation of modifications to execute each and
every feature is mind boggling” <b>says Sairam (CTO Freak).</b></p>
<p>Freak has covered half its way and has
covered many milestones in regard to its development. However, a lot more is to
be done to make the dream of instant gaming a reality of tomorrow. We have
received some investment that had made us travel so far, however we still need
a lot of monetary support to keep Freak going for its final phase of
development. Monetary support is indeed necessary to keep the project going and
bring it to the final release. </p>
<p>This product was initially thought of as an
ice breaker for conversations, and later on all the features and
functionalities were built upon the single idea of simultaneous gaming and
chatting. The idea of simultaneous gaming and chatting in a single application
that allows login only via the phone number, seemed so attractive, that all the
other features were decided to make the decided experience even more smooth and
user friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our target audience is the world. We have not built
or thought of this application targeting a small section of the society or any
age group. This application has been designed in a way that one and all can use
it. The application is so user friendly, that someone need not be a pro gamer
to play games in it, although offers a lot of exciting features like the avatar
name for a gamer and the ledger board with exciting badges to have the gamer’s
interest. The chatting features that has been added as USPs are all keeping in
mind the drawbacks or gap in features that the existing applications of instant
chatting has, to make Freak a wholesome application, that keeps the user
engaged by offering all that he has. This a world class application, and
follows international standards in all aspects. All the stickers, audio buzzes
and designs has been laid out keeping the international audience in mind.</p>

</div>","Freak: An Instant Gaming App
Freak is to introduce an Instant Gaming platform to the word. A wide range of games to be played with one and all on your phone book
just on a click. Freak is to break the hazardous ways of Gaming by logging in
via some social media sites revealing a lot of personal information online every
time a game is to be played. Freak offers login only via your contact number
and automatically adds everyone in your contact list to be able to play any
games with them. Freak is to simplify the entire gaming experience. One
time Login, chose the contact and start playing, indeed that simple. To make gaming more
interesting Freak also allows you to chat with your gaming partner or in a group
along with other unique features.
Freak was founded by 5 college pass-outs with the idea of
breaking the boredom involved in chatting. The founders once passed out college
went to be a part of the Silicon Valley in much reputed companies with a lot of
enthusiasm, just to realize it won’t last for long. Passtimes were spent only
by chatting with friends online that got boring everytime we ran out of topic.
When these coffee lovers, met one evening at a café, the idea of freak took
birth. The conversation was a regular one that involved how bored they were
with their jobs and that chatting was the only option to fill in the hours. The
co-founders, were all the cream of their own college and refused to fit it,
when they could stand out.
“The idea of freak literally freaked me out with the
realization that I can contribute to the world of technology and entertainment.
It was the scope for me to deliver my idea at the world stage, to have
something of my own, and share it to the world.” Said Aroof (Founder - Freak).                                                                                        Home Screen and Registration
“Chatting apps got boring after a few minutes all the time.
The idea of playing a small yet exciting game with friends was just
irresistible “says Mumpi (Co-founder - Freak).
                                                   Tic Tac Toe & Arm Wrestling
Slowly and steadily the whole Idea around freak was
discussed over various such evening coffees, and finally we were self-assured
that we wanted to bring this baby to the world. We did not even spare a second
thought before leaving the Silicon Valley, since we were totally sure we are
bringing something what everybody wants yet have never noticed.
“Freak could the best ice breaker / conversation filler for

<p>As a child of the 70s and 80s, the single-most happy childhood memory I have is the endless hours spent in the arcade with my brother. These days, every time we meet and re-count our growing up years, I yearn to re-create and re-capture those moments when the simple pleasures were about achieving top ranking on the High Score list of Pac-Man and Space Invaders. </p>
<p>I want to bring back the good ol' days and just be able to chill out with my brother once again and introduce the wonder of arcade games to my daughter.</p>
<p>I’m a ""tinker-er"" by nature, and love to take things apart and build stuff just for the heck of it. I used to do this late at night due to my day job. More recently, I quit my day job to try tinkering full-time!</p>
<br/>
<h3>My First Pixel Play Arcade Prototype</h3>
<p>Based on M.A.M.E. (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) that I tinkered with way back in 2000, I set out in late 2014 to build a home arcade system that could play all the classic video games. After much research and trial-and-error, I built the first prototype out of vanguard sheets (paper!). </p>

<br/>
<p>My first order of business when I started out with the vanguard sheet prototype was to source for the parts and then model the housing using Google's Sketchup 3D program. I then had to figure out how I was going to actually build the housing.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Building My First Production Pixel Play Arcade</h3>
<p>The building of the housing evolved over time. I first decided that the most cost-effective method was to CNC-cut the material (essentially using a computer to control the cutting tool) rather that to mill by hand. The problem was that I didn't have access to any tools. So I decided to build my own. I started with a wooden version CNC router. It wasn’t pretty and neither was the cut for the housing. But it was a crucial first step towards my goal.
</p>
<p>I then decided to build a ""proper"" CNC milling machine (I called it the Ox). While it worked a lot better, I was still not happy with the finishing, and the edges were rough and needed to be sanded down.  My final solution was found when I chanced upon a 60 watt laser cutter and I decided to try to laser-cut my housing.  Needless to say, it was <i style=""background-color: initial;"">voila </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">and since then, I never looked back.</span></p>

<p>When I finally built Pixel Play Arcade, I did not realize the significance of what I had done until I showed it to my friends. It brought back so many memories for them (they're kinda in my generation) and the Pixel Play Arcade became the talk of every party. Another surprising thing happened: our kids began to play with it too. There was instant connection across the generations and I've not seen parents and kids have fun like this in a long time: everyone was a kid in the room!</p>
<p>I soon started to get ""orders"" to produce Pixel Play Arcade for my friends. Even acquaintances and colleagues began to ask me to build it for them. It was then that I understood that this project had great potential to bring joy to so many people. </p>

<p>With my home-made tools, my current rate of production is about 1 per week. I estimate that with practice, I might be able to bring that down a little, but not much more. To fulfil the backlog of orders quickly (many would like me to do this by Christmas. Yikes!), I need better tools to increase my rate of production. I figured I need the following:</p>

<p>With the new machines, I am able to produce at a rate of 2 per day. That's more than a 10-fold increase in the production rate. With this capacity, I'll be able to fulfil orders at a much higher rate!</p>
<p>BUT... that's not all. Even as I am fulfilling this dream, I'm already dreaming up a <span style=""background-color: initial;""> <b>2-player Pixel Play Arcade</b>. This is the other reason why I need better tools, especially the 4'x8' laser cutter. I have built a wood prototype of the 2-player arcade but because of the size limitation of my current laser cutter, I am not able to go much bigger. This prototype is hand-milled, which is not only painfully time consuming but also not well finished. I also built a ""proof-of-concept"" demonstrator using metal extrusion as a frame. I need your help to fulfil my dream!</span></p>

<h3>The Pixel Play Arcade</h3>
<p>Every Pixel Play Arcade is hand-made.</p>
<p>First, I laser-cut 3 pieces of 400mm x 600mm wood (one at a time). I then sand the wood, route the curves, and then lacquer them. Prior to assembly, I ""wrap"" the console with veneer and finally glue all the parts together.  </p>

<h3>Perks: The Portable Pixel Play Arcade (3PA)</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Portable Pixel Play Arcade (this is a mouthful so I'll call it 3PA) will include all the hardware that you need to start playing classic games on your TV.  Just connect the power into the console, HDMI from console to TV and turn on the Gamepads and you will have a 2-player console. When you are done, you can just plug the Gamepads into the console for charging.  
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The 3PA has the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Raspberry Pi Version 3 (the ""brain"")</span><br/>
</li>
<li>EU USB wall plug (micro USB cable) to power the 3PA</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everywhere I go, I've received the same request: Can I build one for them? Whether it is wives buying for their husbands, or kids for their dads, or dads for their kids, it is the same: Can I deliver it soon? I feel so bad when I tell them that I am limited in production capacity, and that they'll likely only get theirs sometime next year. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even if I'm not able to raise the full amount, I'll still be able to fulfill your orders, except that I'll take quite a lot longer to get it to you. There is little risk to the completion of the design, as I already have a production model up and running. </p>

</div></div>","Intro
As a child of the 70s and 80s, the single-most happy childhood memory I have is the endless hours spent in the arcade with my brother. These days, every time we meet and re-count our growing up years, I yearn to re-create and re-capture those moments when the simple pleasures were about achieving top ranking on the High Score list of Pac-Man and Space Invaders. 
I want to bring back the good ol' days and just be able to chill out with my brother once again and introduce the wonder of arcade games to my daughter.
I’m a ""tinker-er"" by nature, and love to take things apart and build stuff just for the heck of it. I used to do this late at night due to my day job. More recently, I quit my day job to try tinkering full-time!

My First Pixel Play Arcade Prototype
Based on M.A.M.E. (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) that I tinkered with way back in 2000, I set out in late 2014 to build a home arcade system that could play all the classic video games. After much research and trial-and-error, I built the first prototype out of vanguard sheets (paper!). 












Starting Point: 1st Prototype made out of vanguard sheet




My first order of business when I started out with the vanguard sheet prototype was to source for the parts and then model the housing using Google's Sketchup 3D program. I then had to figure out how I was going to actually build the housing.

Building My First Production Pixel Play Arcade
The building of the housing evolved over time. I first decided that the most cost-effective method was to CNC-cut the material (essentially using a computer to control the cutting tool) rather that to mill by hand. The problem was that I didn't have access to any tools. So I decided to build my own. I started with a wooden version CNC router. It wasn’t pretty and neither was the cut for the housing. But it was a crucial first step towards my goal.

I then decided to build a ""proper"" CNC milling machine (I called it the Ox). While it worked a lot better, I was still not happy with the finishing, and the edges were rough and needed to be sanded down.  My final solution was found when I chanced upon a 60 watt laser cutter and I decided to try to laser-cut my housing.  Needless to say, it was voila and since then, I never looked back.




 

 

 


(Left to Right): 1st CNC routing machine built on my kitchen table; proper CNC routing machine named “Ox”; finally my laser-cutter solution.




When I finally built Pixel Play Arcade, I did not realize the significance of what I had done until I showed it to my friends. It brought back so many memories for them (they're kinda in my generation) and the Pixel Play Arcade became the talk of every party. Another surprising thing happened: our kids began to play with it too. There was instant connection across the generations and I've not seen parents and kids have fun like this in a long time: everyone was a kid in the room!
I soon started to get ""orders"" to produce Pixel Play Arcade for my friends. Even acquaintances and colleagues began to ask me to build it for them. It was then that I understood that this project had great potential to bring joy to so many people. 








The final finished product... Pixel Play Arcade




Why I Need Your Help
With my home-made tools, my current rate of production is about 1 per week. I estimate that with practice, I might be able to bring that down a little, but not much more. To fulfil the backlog of orders quickly (many would like me to do this by Christmas. Yikes!), I need better tools to increase my rate of production. I figured I need the following:
COST ESTIMATION



Item / Desc.
Qty. 
@ 
 Price 


4'x8' Flatbed Laser Cutter
1
$15,000.00
$15,000.00

$500.00
$500.00


Others
1
$2,500.00
$2,500.00


Total Cost Estimation
$20,000.00




With the new machines, I am able to produce at a rate of 2 per day. That's more than a 10-fold increase in the production rate. With this capacity, I'll be able to fulfil orders at a much higher rate!
BUT... that's not all. Even as I am fulfilling this dream, I'm already dreaming up a  2-player Pixel Play Arcade. This is the other reason why I need better tools, especially the 4'x8' laser cutter. I have built a wood prototype of the 2-player arcade but because of the size limitation of my current laser cutter, I am not able to go much bigger. This prototype is hand-milled, which is not only painfully time consuming but also not well finished. I also built a ""proof-of-concept"" demonstrator using metal extrusion as a frame. I need your help to fulfil my dream!

Possible Design of a 2-Player Pixel Play Arcade... 






 
The Pixel Play Arcade
Every Pixel Play Arcade is hand-made.
First, I laser-cut 3 pieces of 400mm x 600mm wood (one at a time). I then sand the wood, route the curves, and then lacquer them. Prior to assembly, I ""wrap"" the console with veneer and finally glue all the parts together.  






Routing of the wood to give it a curve and rounded ends to the console 





The veneer I have chosen is one that I really like as it has a nice dark wood-like finish as shown below.


Pixel Play Arcade has the following components: 


Raspberry Pi Version 3 (the ""brain"")

8GB mini-SD memory card (the ""hard-drive"")
Joystick with 10 LED buttons
5W, 4 ohms dual Speakers 
10.1"" LCD Screen with remote control
8-ports 5V, 5 Amp USB
The console is installed with

Latest Raspbian ""Jessie"" (Linux for Raspberry Pi)
Emulationstation (Front end and emulator)
A few Shareware games















Pixel Play Arcade




When the arcade gets to you, all you have to do is to power on and play. If you intend to download more ROMs/games, you first have to setup a connection to your network (just like when you first buy a PC). To do that, you can follow the steps shown here and follow the section labelled ""Connecting to Your Network"". 

After you have downloaded the ROMs/games onto your PC or Mac, follow the instructions on how to transfer the ROMs/games onto Pixel Play Arcade here or see the FAQ below.

Perks: The Portable Pixel Play Arcade (3PA)



Portable Pixel Play Arcade (this is a mouthful so I'll call it 3PA) will include all the hardware that you need to start playing classic games on your TV.  Just connect the power into the console, HDMI from console to TV and turn on the Gamepads and you will have a 2-player console. When you are done, you can just plug the Gamepads into the console for charging.  


The 3PA has the following components:


Raspberry Pi Version 3 (the ""brain"")

EU USB wall plug (micro USB cable) to power the 3PA
8GB mini-SD memory card (the ""hard-drive"")
HDMI cable - to display the output to the TV
2 x Bluetooth 8Bitdo Zero Gamepads
2 x short micro USB cable to charge the Gamepads




Here are the specs of the components:








Housing with Raspberry Pi 3 with dimensions 95.0mm (L) x 65.0mm (W) x 30.0 (h)
110 - 240 V EU Wall Charger for any voltage usage around the world
HDMI Cable that connects to the Raspberry Pi and output to TV console
2 x GamePads with charger of dimensions 75.0mm (W) x 40.0mm (D) x 15.0mm (H)







   



The finished product... the Portable Pixel Play Arcade (3PA)






The console is installed with

Latest Raspbian ""Jessie""
Emulationstation
A few Shareware games

When the console gets to you, connect the HDMI cable to your Raspberry Pi and the other end to the HDMI port of your TV.  Plug in the power and remember to turn on your Gamepads. The 3PA will then power up you will see the main emulator screen.
Both the Gamepads should already be configured to connect to the 3PA but if for some reason it does not, follow the instructions here to connect. 
If you intend to download more ROMs/games, you have to first setup a connection to your network (just like when you first buy a PC). To do that, you can follow the steps shown here and follow the section labelled ""Connecting to Your Network"".
After you have downloaded the ROMs/games onto your PC or Mac, follow the instructions on how to transfer the ROMs/games onto the 3PA here or see the FAQ below.

Perks: Pixel Play Wireless Handphone Charger
As with the Pixel Play console, this is hand-made out of ply wood.  It works like a Qi charger (i.e. wireless) and the set includes a USB cable. If your handphone is wireless charging-enabled, a $28 contribution will get you this perk.

Perks: Gamepad Key Chain
As with the Pixel Play console, this is hand-made out of ply wood.  It is a key chain in the shape of a gamepad.

Perks: $1 Contribution
Every dollar will help me get closer to my goal of building a Pixel Play Arcade faster, and build a 2-player console as well. Without volume purchase, it is very hard for me to acquire better tools to shorten the production time, so every dollar helps.

<h3><strong>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREATION PROCESS</strong></h3>
<p><br/>The main objective when creating this type of accounts is security.</p>
<p>We have taken care of all phases of creation just like in the rest of our accounts, but the final phase especially the last steps up to the level change we have done totally manually.</p>
<p>We have loaded the count of lucky eggs, we have loaded it on a smartphone and using the lucky eggs, next to an official device Pokemon Go Plus we have traveled dozens of Km in areas full of PokepStops and Pokemon.</p>
<p>It is a very laborious job, but this guarantees us to give a real human treatment to the account and not put at risk an account of such a high level.</p>
<p>All the final evolutions and discards are always made from a Smartphone with the official Pokemon Go App.</p>
<p>All Sniping has been done manually, with smartphone equipped with VPN from the target zone and always using the Official Pokemon GO App.</p>
</div></div>","With ThePokemonFactory.com guarantee 
- Over 1,500 unique visitors per day- More than 400 accounts sold each month- 0% of banned accounts
All contributors will have exclusive access to our Discord channel and our Skype for all questions and suggestions.
ThePokemonFactory.com is the one and only company that currently sells Pokemon Go accounts levels 39 and 40, for us it was easy to realize that to reach these levels safely we had to meet these 3 requirements:- Manual work, forget about bots that will mark your accounts forever, with our Technology owning ""Physical Bot"", we guarantee that our accounts are created humane and always using Pokemon Go App.- Security, we have a network of private VPNs that allow us to make incursions in any location.- Patience, nobody plays 24h a day 7 days a week, we give a rigorous calendar to the account to normalize the creation process.
Although initially our business was directed towards the sale of accounts and alternative services (farming, Catching ...) we have always thought that uninterrupted service to the customer was the only option to be able to guarantee a perfect service for the client.
With a limited number of accounts, and for a limited time, we will create the best accounts in the market with an incredible service:
- Permanent update: every time new Pokemon appear, our customers turn to us to capture and add to their account. Obviously this has a high cost. For this reason you can rest easy, every time there are new additions to Pokemon Go, we will capture them for you, FREE !!.How does it work?When we detect that there are new Pokemon Go, following a rigorous schedule, we will contact you to set a date of capture. You forget everything, we capture your Pokemon and you can continue enjoying the account.
- Anti Ban Guarantee: Only we can guarantee this, our processes of creation are legitimate, rigorous and we never use Bots or Apps of third parties. However you can be even more calm, since if your account is banned for any reason (not covered by the use of bots) we will replace it with an account just like yours
We have everything ready, we only miss you.
These are our wonderful accounts

<p>Aspen is an upcoming visual novel made by Koimarina Games. The story is written keeping a great love of dating sims, sci-fi, and superheroes in mind! Taking down the big bad is an exhausted trope throughout comics, so Aspen has a heavier focus on the characters involved in the story. Getting to know them, improving their lives by reminding them that it isn't <i>all </i>about the usual villain attacks. Sometimes, it can be as simple but as important as just being their best friend.</p>

<h3>The Game</h3>
<p>Planet Ants is a brand new and unique online game that comprises an innovative networked and interconnected ""social media"" game that is played on smartphones either at home or, when permitted, whilst out and about travelling and on the move. The concept is very different to other games using GPS and location technology (for example, “Pokémon GO”) and players will have the advantage to enjoy the many distinct and divergent features and benefits that Planet Ant offers.</p>
<p>The basic idea and concept of the game is for the player to create and then determine the fate and destiny of an ant colony. Players have to feed, enlarge, protect and defend the colony and at the same time also protect, defend and continuously expand the territory that belongs to their own nest. A group of roaming ants is always on the move to gather supplies, form new nests, enlarge the colony and expand the territory.</p>
<p>One of the main aspects of the game and the key to what makes it so different and special from other games is the use of the existing GPS function that is installed on all smartphones and the fact that the player has the ability to use their current geographical location to communicate with their allies and friends. Eventually, this aspect will become even more important as the game develops and battles are introduced so that the colony will be in a position to launch raids on a predatory basis and gain food and territory if they are successful.</p>
<p>An additional and important part of the game is the inclusion of an in-game premium currency called “DITS” that will provide a better gaming experience. All perks include discounts and/or rewards of DITS!</p>
<p>Planet Ants is and will always be a free-to-play game and there will never be a cost for the App. It will never be possible to buy your way to success and the game will always be based on skill and dedication. The use of DITS is only for certain enhancements and is explained fully in the FAQ section.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We are Planet Ants, an English company with Swiss shareholders. We have a vision – to bring a unique and exciting smartphone game to the market.</p>
<p>We have researched and developed something that is unique and that will change the world of gaming. We are passionate and completely focused on realising a successful Indiegogo campaign to enable us to give gamers the game that they have been waiting for.</p>
<p>The infrastructure is there, the extremely complicated game design and structure is complete, the initial graphics are ready and there is a pre-agreement with a leading gaming software developer.</p>
<p>Contributors to our campaign will effectively be an integral part of a new episode in the world of gaming and will be able to justifiably say that they were instrumental in ensuring that Planet Ants conquers the market. Everyone who contributes will be a valued member of the Planet Ants world and community.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £ 15,000 to be able to conclude an agreement with a leading game software developer to get the first phase of Planet Ants out and onto the market. In this first phase, players will establish and build their colony and have several options for individual design and to prepare for future game phases and strategies. We guarantee that every single pence (or cent!) of that amount will be used only for this!</p>
<p>We can also guarantee that if we raise more than our original target, game phases 2 and 3 will be developed and released at the same time. These phases will concentrate on expanding the colony, building defence structures and strategies and preparing for roaming expeditions.</p>
<p>There will be an ongoing development programme with the release of additional game phases and levels to include building alliances, launching patrols with eventual battlefield operations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As you see, we have released a quite amazing range of perks that reward our backers in an almost unbelievable way - based on levels of commitment and the principle that the more you can pledge, the more benefits you receive on an exponential basis. Early Birds will get even more!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We would expect most contributors to be active gamers and the range of perks reflect that by offering significant in-game and other benefits. We are sure that the possibility to be an integral part of the Planet Ants world will also be attractive and that everyone will be proud to be able to say that they were there right at the start.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, we also have something for non-gamers and have created a unique perk – the “Gift Voucher” – an excellent value option designed as a great way to give a present to family and friends who are gamers.</p>
<p>The Planet Ants team consists of a small core of people who have had a varied and always successful track record in the business world and have the necessary talents and abilities to bring the unique smartphone game that they have developed to the market. Their goal is to provide something different, something unique, something that gamers have been waiting for and will want to play.</p>
<p>We are real people and we will always be there for you. We believe that Planet Ants will indeed change the world of gaming. We believe that gamers will want to be a part of Planet Ants and that, most importantly, the game will change their lives and give them social mobility, the ability to meet new friends and, perhaps, most of all, enjoy a great game with a real purpose.</p>

Below you can see examples of the escape from earth posters, and the potential XBOX one case. There are also 4 e-postcards of different designs, 8 different escape from earth wallpapers. We have done a few test prints to perfect the size for cases as well as getting the size right for the download card that goes inside, with it's own scratch off silver section for the code.   This is the second attempt at crowd funding this game, and since the last one I have learnt a lot about who to trust, and when. This time around we have some great support from people spreading the word, to streaming, and Youtube videos. With the main body of code already in place, the challenges should be fairly small, with mostly minor additions and tweaks.  As we go through the build process there will be updates to show how things are progressing. Like all projects there is some risks involved, however as we're keeping our sites on a game which is fun, enjoyable, and attractive to all rather than triple A title, this should help us keep the risks to a minimum.  Below are some stretch goals we have set, if we go over the total we are trying to raise we will do some extra stuff for the game. The £15,000 stretch goal is unlocked this will give you an idea of we what have planned if we hit it. £15,000: Professional Language TranslationFull Motion Video Animation (will replace are built in animation system at start of new game)Android Support (android is planned but later down line if we hit this we will work on it as we do pc and xbox uwp builds)£20,000: LOCKED£25,000: LOCKED£30,000: LOCKED£35,000: LOCKED Discord: Click MeTwitter: Click MeInstagram: Click Me Click Image for demo I have add this section, me Stefan, so i can say thank you to some people that have helped me a lot and supported me a lot. I would like to see a huge thank you to Red Event Studios ""Leon"" for taking time out of his busy schedule to do the funding video and editing it and everything else for it. I would also like to thank Leon personal for all of his support as a friend and help me with some person stuff going on in my life. I have include some of his social media links about if you would like to check him out.YouTube: Red Event Studios I meet Ilona ""IloSomnia"" from a friends discord and have become very since as she has helped me grow my twitch channel form sharing to lurking and being a huge support to Escape From Earth asking about how development is doing and offering to play the game when it out and make video that i can use on the games story page as well. I have add Ilona twitch link below.Twitch: IloSomnia I meet Dogwisdom ""Eric"" throw a person call SamsterPlays as twitch streamer that i can't remember how i meet since then Dogwisdom and me have become very good friend and he has taken large interest in Escape From Earth promoting it on every single stream as well as promoting my channel that has given me a massive boost.  Twitch: Dogwisdom",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Disciples of the Storm is a unique RTS looking to reboot the game style mechanics of the old RTS, Netstorm Islands at War. Under a new game world, and IP, it seeks to bring the same style into 3D environment in a slowly expanding world.</div>
Enter the world of Sonus, ruled by the powerful and fickle Tempest gods of Wind, Thunder, Rain, and Sun.</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The world of Sonus is torn by powerful, eternal storms. The native inhabitants live on the majestic islands hovering high above the billowing maelstrom. Even though the inhabitants normally live in the calmer skies, their islands, over time, will be called down to the lower levels by the Tempests during what the natives call ""Times of Descent"". There they battle to prove their faction's worthiness to the Tempests and in so doing ascend once more to the peaceful higher realms.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b></b><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453151534/kbsec05a2usuyfpubmom.png"" src="""" style=""width: 539px; height: 405px;""/></p>
<b><div style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""background-color: initial;""><b>High Priests</b></b></div></b></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>Take control of a high priest of Sonus. Your faction's priest may align to any one of the Tempest by constructing a temple dedicated to one of your choosing. Your priest is your avatar, and through your priest you may cast powerful spells to turn the tide of battle and aid your units. <span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Though your priest is your avatar in-game, he is also your enemies number one goal to capture to submit as an offering to their chosen Tempest through an altar they construct.</span></div><div>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>While some RTS game bridges may be a single point on a map to cross a river or canyon, in DOTS, bridge play is vital to expand beyond ones home islands. Placeable bridge sections not only act as pathways for your resource collecting units to travel along linked islands, but weapon platforms may also be constructed off the ends of bridges allowing players to further fortify areas, even if local islands are to small, to support many units on them.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></span></p>

<p>The world of Sonus is one of shattered landscapes and floating sky islands.</p>
<p>
Larger sky islands are home to the priests and tribes.  These islands 
often have short undulating grass or palm like trees swaying in the 
wind. </p>
<p>Smaller sky islands, which form most of the world, often 
have little to no trees or vegetation but do have hardy vines that hang 
from their rocky edges. </p>
<p>Long forgotten islands are often home to 
ruins believed to be left over from the time of the Great Sundering.  On
 these remote and rare islands players may find vaults of treasures for 
those that can capture and hold them.</p>

<p>Be part of gaming history by helping launch the re-conceptualized and spiritual successor of the greatest video game. </p>
<p>Released
 in 1997, NetStorm: Islands at War was a bridge-building, 
island-capturing, static-unit warfare RTS. NetStorm broke new ground 
with its unique combination of Tetris-style puzzle and chess-like game 
features. PC Gamer gave it a score of 91. C-Net called it “The #1 game 
of all time that no one ever bought.”</p>
<p>
Launch time and promotion issues relegated NetStorm to the fringe of the
 evolving online gaming frontier where a strong community of enthusiasts
 has kept it alive for more than 15 years!</p>
<p>Now a talented team of 
game developers and former NetStorm enthusiasts, working in partnership 
with the original developers are seeking to create Disciples of the 
Storm, a 3D, full-scale RTS reboot and rebirth of the originals 
game-play style to life.</p>
<p>Our build vision aims to first establish a technically solid DOTS 
limited Multi-player experience. Subsequent stretch goals, in phases, 
will allow the full-scale vision of what we believe Disciples of the 
Storm can be — a totally engrossing, communal, tactics-and-strategy 
warfare game.</p>
<p> 
Full-scale creation on this level represents a significant amount of 
work and time, including new art, new models, animations, and spells. We
 have an extremely talented team who, with the main goal funding, can 
dive into producing polished content. </p>
<p>Your support will help us bring Disciples of the Storm from the realm of concept to reality and playability.</p>
<p><br/></p>

 collective of gaming industry leaders and bold development team 
envision Disciples of the Storm as not only a rebirth of the classic 
game-play style of NetStorm but as a strategy game that will continue to
 expand over time in both physical and dynamic complexity as the team 
will seek to actively expand and continue development well beyond 
release with add-ons.  A wide range of new building units, weaponry, 
bridge styles and spells, along with flexibility in play from individual
 to group, to full-scale guild tournament warfare, promises to make 
Disciples of the Storm unlike any game currently on the market.</span><br/></p>

<ul><li>New IP, New World: As a top-to-bottom concept reboot, Disciples of 
the Storm uses a new IP for long-term stability and to avoid confusion 
with the the old game NetStorm. Disciples of the Storm takes place in an
 entirely new world with redesigned units, spells and effects.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
    The factions of the Tempest: DOTS features 4 factions with the 
factions of Wind, Rain, Thunder and Sun. With each side having close to 
12 unit types each, along with faction neutral buildings that can be 
constructed by any faction to aid their cause.</li></ul>
<ul><li>    Fast Paced Game Play: rapid gameplay of capturing and holding islands and control of pathways through
 islands are vital to victory as player create buffer islands to further fortify their home island.</li></ul>
<ul><li>    Bridging system: 
DOTS features a custom bridging and placement system which allows 
placement of different bridge types allowing for construction of bridge 
networks to support both resource collection and expanding the battle 
front.</li></ul>
<ul><li>    Tower Offense: DOTS use of different static 
defense and attack units with the ability to be built linked off side of
 bridge ends allow for construction of both on islands and out over the
 void of the open sky. DOTS attack and defense units and attack units draw on elements of Tower Defense meets Tower Offense.</li></ul>
<ul><li>    Random Map 
Generation: DOTS feature on the fly map generation for both island 
generation in island shapes and with placement of islands and resources 
allowing for each multiplayer game to be unique.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Multi-platform support: DOTS supports running on Windows, Linux and Mac.</li></ul>
<p><b>Planned features beyond Steam early access first multiplayer release.</b></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Single Player Skirmish AI</b> – Play against user selected number of AI in a single player skirmish AI with adjustable difficulty.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Single Player Campaign: </b>single player campaign and mission with save and load ability.</li></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>We have a majority of Sun unit draft concepts ready and waiting to be modeled and textured along with polished and animated model's already in-game. We are aiming to raise 10k to implement the finished assets for the Steam build for an August release that will have the first two Tempest factions of Rain and Sun implemented in-game.<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></div>If we raise the 10k and go over our set goal our one industry backer will match those funds, bringing our development war-chest to 20k.<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div></div>
</div>Backers will get a fully playable build of DOTS that will include:

1.  Two working Tempest faction of Rain and Sun faction with their respective units.

2. Working Multiplayer build where players will be able to log into the battle lobby and challenge, or host games with other players. 

Our goal is to release the first public release of DOTS on Steam and start growing the player base who will be able to play with the first two Tempest factions, and as the community grows, move to start implementing the remaining Tempest factions of Wind and Thunder.

While the Wind faction will be in the first release of DOTS, its faction will not have polished unit meshes but will primarily have early developer assets stand-ins as placeholders.<div></div><div><br/></div><div>
<div>Some of the early Developer assets art productions stand-in assets for wind faction assets until final polished art design look and models are done for the wind faction.</div>

</div></div>","Disciples of the Storm is a unique RTS looking to reboot the game style mechanics of the old RTS, Netstorm Islands at War. Under a new game world, and IP, it seeks to bring the same style into 3D environment in a slowly expanding world.
Enter the world of Sonus, ruled by the powerful and fickle Tempest gods of Wind, Thunder, Rain, and Sun.The world of Sonus is torn by powerful, eternal storms. The native inhabitants live on the majestic islands hovering high above the billowing maelstrom. Even though the inhabitants normally live in the calmer skies, their islands, over time, will be called down to the lower levels by the Tempests during what the natives call ""Times of Descent"". There they battle to prove their faction's worthiness to the Tempests and in so doing ascend once more to the peaceful higher realms.
High Priests
Take control of a high priest of Sonus. Your faction's priest may align to any one of the Tempest by constructing a temple dedicated to one of your choosing. Your priest is your avatar, and through your priest you may cast powerful spells to turn the tide of battle and aid your units. 
Though your priest is your avatar in-game, he is also your enemies number one goal to capture to submit as an offering to their chosen Tempest through an altar they construct.

Bridges
While some RTS game bridges may be a single point on a map to cross a river or canyon, in DOTS, bridge play is vital to expand beyond ones home islands. Placeable bridge sections not only act as pathways for your resource collecting units to travel along linked islands, but weapon platforms may also be constructed off the ends of bridges allowing players to further fortify areas, even if local islands are to small, to support many units on them.
Each bridge section may take damage and over time and could start to erode, crumbling away if not linked up with another island or have a weapons platform attached to its end.












The world of Sonus is one of shattered landscapes and floating sky islands.

Larger sky islands are home to the priests and tribes.  These islands 
often have short undulating grass or palm like trees swaying in the 
wind. 
Smaller sky islands, which form most of the world, often 
have little to no trees or vegetation but do have hardy vines that hang 
from their rocky edges. 
Long forgotten islands are often home to 
ruins believed to be left over from the time of the Great Sundering.  On
 these remote and rare islands players may find vaults of treasures for 
those that can capture and hold them.











Tempest of Wind:  Wind faction harness the power of air and wind for both defense and attack units.



Thunder Tempest: Thunder faction units are dark and brooding structures that flicker with charges of electricity drawing on the Tempest of Thunder to unleash lighting and devastating thunder cannon attacks over great range and zap enemy units out of the sky. 



Rain Tempest: Units draw on water to form ice based units with some having the ability to heal over time, ice shard casters that spew forth streams of icicle shards that bounce and scatter damaging multiple units and the rain beasts spawned from pools that drift through the air to attack nearby enemy units


Sun Tempest: in a world of storms even so the sun may shine through! followers of the sun while may be weaker individually are Cheap versatile and deadly in number along.  






http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=294002132
Over the past year Storm Isle Productions has been focused on creating 
and drafting new concepts to create new unit designs for the factions while trying to draw inspiration from old concepts. 



Neutral Shrine Building: build-able by any faction used for capturing unclaimed islands and preventing enemy from constructing on island.






Our team is seeking to create a new world in 3D that can be slowly expanded over time to bring both new units to game but also life to the world as a vivid battle field that evolves slowly as team implements more features and world assets.


Be part of gaming history by helping launch the re-conceptualized and spiritual successor of the greatest video game. 
Released
 in 1997, NetStorm: Islands at War was a bridge-building, 
island-capturing, static-unit warfare RTS. NetStorm broke new ground 
with its unique combination of Tetris-style puzzle and chess-like game 
features. PC Gamer gave it a score of 91. C-Net called it “The #1 game 
of all time that no one ever bought.”

Launch time and promotion issues relegated NetStorm to the fringe of the
 evolving online gaming frontier where a strong community of enthusiasts
 has kept it alive for more than 15 years!
Now a talented team of 
game developers and former NetStorm enthusiasts, working in partnership 
with the original developers are seeking to create Disciples of the 
Storm, a 3D, full-scale RTS reboot and rebirth of the originals 
game-play style to life.
Our build vision aims to first establish a technically solid DOTS 
limited Multi-player experience. Subsequent stretch goals, in phases, 
will allow the full-scale vision of what we believe Disciples of the 
Storm can be — a totally engrossing, communal, tactics-and-strategy 
warfare game.
 
Full-scale creation on this level represents a significant amount of 
work and time, including new art, new models, animations, and spells. We
 have an extremely talented team who, with the main goal funding, can 
dive into producing polished content. 
Your support will help us bring Disciples of the Storm from the realm of concept to reality and playability.




Our team at Storm Isle Productions is backed by original NetStorm co-creator and founder of Kongregate, Jim Greer.  Kongregate is a browser based game hosting site.  Along with Jim's backing we also have working with us on development
Beverly Garland who in the past has worked on Wingcommander, Ultima, Crusader no remorse, Ultima VIII: Pagan, NetStorm: Islands at war 
Morgan Ogburn who worked on Ultima IX, Tron Evolution, and Resident Evil 5, NetStorm: Islands at war helping us on concepts designs for units.
Nathan Fabian a programmer from Longshot Studios who has been working on Torment: Tides of Numenera contracted with inXile Entertainment. 
This
 collective of gaming industry leaders and bold development team 
envision Disciples of the Storm as not only a rebirth of the classic 
game-play style of NetStorm but as a strategy game that will continue to
 expand over time in both physical and dynamic complexity as the team 
will seek to actively expand and continue development well beyond 
release with add-ons.  A wide range of new building units, weaponry, 
bridge styles and spells, along with flexibility in play from individual
 to group, to full-scale guild tournament warfare, promises to make 
Disciples of the Storm unlike any game currently on the market.

Sun Faction Concept Meshes







New IP, New World: As a top-to-bottom concept reboot, Disciples of 
the Storm uses a new IP for long-term stability and to avoid confusion 
with the the old game NetStorm. Disciples of the Storm takes place in an
 entirely new world with redesigned units, spells and effects.

    The factions of the Tempest: DOTS features 4 factions with the 
factions of Wind, Rain, Thunder and Sun. With each side having close to 
12 unit types each, along with faction neutral buildings that can be 
constructed by any faction to aid their cause.
    Fast Paced Game Play: rapid gameplay of capturing and holding islands and control of pathways through
 islands are vital to victory as player create buffer islands to further fortify their home island.
    Bridging system: 
DOTS features a custom bridging and placement system which allows 
placement of different bridge types allowing for construction of bridge 
networks to support both resource collection and expanding the battle 
front.
    Tower Offense: DOTS use of different static 
defense and attack units with the ability to be built linked off side of
 bridge ends allow for construction of both on islands and out over the
 void of the open sky. DOTS attack and defense units and attack units draw on elements of Tower Defense meets Tower Offense.
    Random Map 
Generation: DOTS feature on the fly map generation for both island 
generation in island shapes and with placement of islands and resources 
allowing for each multiplayer game to be unique.
Multi-platform support: DOTS supports running on Windows, Linux and Mac.
Planned features beyond Steam early access first multiplayer release.

Single Player Skirmish AI – Play against user selected number of AI in a single player skirmish AI with adjustable difficulty.

Single Player Campaign: single player campaign and mission with save and load ability.
  What We Need

We have a majority of Sun unit draft concepts ready and waiting to be modeled and textured along with polished and animated model's already in-game. We are aiming to raise 10k to implement the finished assets for the Steam build for an August release that will have the first two Tempest factions of Rain and Sun implemented in-game.

If we raise the 10k and go over our set goal our one industry backer will match those funds, bringing our development war-chest to 20k.

What You Get


Backers will get a fully playable build of DOTS that will include:

1.  Two working Tempest faction of Rain and Sun faction with their respective units.

2. Working Multiplayer build where players will be able to log into the battle lobby and challenge, or host games with other players. 

Our goal is to release the first public release of DOTS on Steam and start growing the player base who will be able to play with the first two Tempest factions, and as the community grows, move to start implementing the remaining Tempest factions of Wind and Thunder.

While the Wind faction will be in the first release of DOTS, its faction will not have polished unit meshes but will primarily have early developer assets stand-ins as placeholders.
Some of the early Developer assets art productions stand-in assets for wind faction assets until final polished art design look and models are done for the wind faction.

<h3>The Mean Lama Model</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Our modell is what we call it ”Developer Centric”, which means that Mean Lama´s motto is to offer a really good gaming platform, and a generous payback model for the developers and gaming houses.

<p>
</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things about Mean Lama, is that it is open for all game developers. In other words, even if you are a small indie developer with no marketing budget, you still have the same chance as any game house. Also, for the first time ever, the developers of all the legendary games from the 80’s and 90’s have the possibility to earn a few bucks on titles that haven’t been on the shelves in decades!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Technically, we have come very far. For about 1,5 years we have been working on the platform and the backend system has been tested and is ready. We use a patented new protocol, which is much faster and efficient than other gaming servers. To start up a game from installation to gameplay is very fast, even if you share internet via your mobile phone´s 3G/4G.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>A package of great features!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are many advantages with the Mean Lama Gaming platform is; the possibility to parental control and time regulation - in other words you can limit how your kids play during the day and which games they are allowed to play. Also, Mean Lama will not have any binding period. It will be 100% free from viruses and malware. As a little bonus, the platform is built to prevent saving or hacking of the games, which in the end will result in a significant change for the gaming industries loss of income due to pirating in the world.</p>

 We are doing this for hobby and we have jobs related to our role in this project, so what we need is basically some plugin and asset from the unity store to make this game look great :) Also, all the game will be cloud-saved on a server of our property, so add to that a bit of money to maintain the server and the store licenses for a bit!
Also, every game needs some (or A LOT) of advertising to be known, so aside from sharing this project on facebook and twitter, we will use some money to do some advertising!

    Other Ways You Can Help You can't help us with money? Let your friends know about us! Share this page on social networks! You can also contact us if you have ideas to improve our game or if you want to share some ideas for the next one!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello Gamer! We are Druid Gameworks, a multinational group of video game mod authors and students who have banded together remotely to create our own breed of RPG video game experience! Our journey began four years ago as hobbyists trying to break into the industry with a game design we’re passionate about. Our dream game, Witanlore: Echoes of Twilight, was quite ambitious and after testing the waters on Kickstarter to see if we could even fund the project it became clear we needed to start smaller to prove we could even make a game if we hoped to secure funding sources. We took a small alt start quest from our design doc about an Ursine player questing to protect an ancient artifact left in the care of their tribe and wove it into a new design doc for a smaller scoped RPG titled, <strong>Witanlore: Dreamtime</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507660955/fyvnk78unzkliyqes6rh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>While still facing some skepticism within the video game community at large we won a few diehard fans and some meager startup funds and started development. It hasn’t been a perfect road, there are challenges only time and experience can teach you but there’s nothing we aren’t willing to learn, do, or overcome to pursue our dream of someday uniting under one roof in our own studio. We developed our new design into a prototype, then an alpha, we made it through Steam Greenlight quickly topping the chart with thousands of yes votes, we brought the core game into beta and finally to Steam Early Access! We’re very proud of our game and are so close to completing the journey only to now face one of our greatest challenges:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The project budget is dead. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507660903/xjvmubjozc59uxlfedlh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We estimate the core game will be finished in another 6-8 months but we’ve run out of funds and that means we’re running out of time. Reviews of the game in Early Access are quite good but we’re not selling enough units yet to sustain the team financially. Our developers have been working for almost four years, many of us full time 40+ hours a week, with no income. Mortgages, student loans, car payments, even production babies and hurricanes are putting a weighty financial strain on the team. We’ve exhausted avenues for traditional forms of funding like personal loans. Investors and even grant programs all seem hesitant to support a game by an unproven studio despite our perseverance and steady progress! We’ve also been turned down by investment groups because, despite the game looking great, it’s not following the trends of multiplayer, or VR, or because it has no micro-transactions. Our only hope at relieving the financial pressure long enough to finish Witanlore: Dreamtime is <strong>YOU</strong>.</p>

<p>Now maybe the big fish aren't willing to dive in with the funding we need to finish development properly and on time, but with your $5 pledges combined, all of you can give us a shot at reaching our goals and living our dream! We’ve come so far with very little support, we work hard every day to finalize the game at our highest standard, and <strong>you can make all the difference</strong> in whether we reach the end of this journey successfully or not.   </p>

<p>Our goal for this campaign is pretty straight forward. After IndieGoGo takes their share of the money raised, the rest goes to relieving the financial fatigue being felt by key developers and toward promoting/marketing Witanlore: Dreamtime so that it can gain enough traction to support the team moving forward.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Will Game Dev for Ramen! </strong>Things have been pretty tough for the team financially this past year and a half. It seems like game development is like 50% hard work and 50% dumb luck. We haven't been very lucky unfortunately so we work harder, make due with less, and persevere beyond reason because we love games and we love Witanlore! With your pledge you will be directly supporting the developers so they can continue to create the content you want to see finished!</li>
<li>
<strong>Real Games Show. </strong>In order to stand out among the sea of games on the market, real contenders go to major shows like GDC, PAX, etc. We haven't been able to show Dreamtime due to budget constraints. Some of the funds raised here will go toward entry fees, travel/lodgings, and materials to show Witanlore: Dreamtime in at least one major show next year.</li>
<li>
<strong>Take it to The Mountain! </strong>What's left of the funds raised will go toward increasing our media exposure in print, commercials, and social media promotions. The games that are hugely successful are the ones who make the most marketing noise. While we've been in contact with a number of PR agents and marketing masters, this effort will take some coins to get the wheels turning.</li>

<h3>The Story of Drunk on Trump: The Greatest Board Game Ever Made.</h3>
<p>Team DOT started with Clyde (a Painter and part time builder ), Josh (an American drummer) and Jess (a bag designer) on a Saturday night in Whitechapel. We decided to come up with a game, for no other reason than to entertain ourselves. With an enjoyment of politics, a mutual dislike of Trump, a love for drinking and stupidity, we had a good blend of topics to create a game for the evening. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472051478/xgzh67v66bkwv1yqnvcz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The game proved quite fun and to be honest I don’t remember the latter part of the night.</p>
<p> After board one we didn’t think much more of it but did play it a few times with friends. About 4 months later I was invited to a launch of a product, a whoopy cushion with trumps face on it, I didn’t go but did see it in a prominent news paper and thought hmmm, so we got back together.</p>
<p>Many rethinks of the game where drawn up on computer until we arrived at 'the greatest board game ever made' and a Drunk on Trump party at my flat was in order to see how it played out. It was great fun, we changed a few things and the final board was made, after many hours on Google to see how we could produce the product, we put together a plan to launching DOT</p>
<p>The final Board</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Making the video: </strong>After looking at Indiegogo with the very small budge, we decided we needed a video for the campaign. After harassing friends and asking around we found a young aspiring film maker, Hedley Marks. I had an idea for the video and after a few back and forths, we had a deal. He was booked to start filming with Will Duffield the following week.</p>

<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/180022465?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>Being a builder, I then got to making the set in my flat. With five days to build, one day to film and the help of many friend some how we had a pretty cool video.  </p>
<div> </div>
<p>So hear we are now, we hope you like the video and can get behind us on making the game a reality for the masses!</p>
<p><u><strong>Game Overview</strong></u></p>
<p>Drunk on Trump is a simple game where each player chooses a coloured counter and in turn takes all the bricks of that colour. The objective of the game is to get all your bricks down to build a wall around your side of the board. The first player to finish their bricks wins.</p>
<p>When moving around the board there are many silly and fun things to land on such as Trump cards which are placed on the board, Trump cards contain dares and drinking penalties.</p>
<p>Example of trump cards:</p>

<p>There are also 10 blank trump cards for you to create your own fun.</p>
<p>Another thing a player may land on is the policy pot which is placed on the board. If players land on certain squares, they may have to put a % of their drink in the policy pot or even have to drink it.</p>

<h2>
<strong>完整計劃！</strong>The Full Plan!</h2>
<p>這個深入的影片將回答你有關於咒文的任何問題!<br/>This in depth video will answer any questions that you have about 咒文!</p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/dV9gPIs-FtE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<h3>仁咒義蛋 The Enchanted Egg</h3>
<div>
<p>玩家將扮演""咒""（Joe）的角色，這是一個巧妙的蛋黃，他的主人在他死前委託他保護帝國免受黑魔法。 然而，喬不是他主人第一次創造這樣一個監護人的嘗試。 原來的創作是""呪""，但他們的主人認為他是一個失敗的企圖。</p>
<p>The player will take the role of 咒 (Joe – Zhou), an enchanted egg yolk who was entrusted by his master before his death to protect the empire from dark magic. However, Joe was not his master’s first attempt at creating such a guardian. The original creation was 呪 (Zhou - the alternative form of the caracter 咒), however their master considered him to be a failed attempt. </p>
<p>憤怒的這個咒的更老的雙胞胎尋求報復，把咒從他的第一次機會出帝國。 這把咒發射到一個被稱為羅馬帝國的奇怪和遙遠的土地上。 雖然有人咒設法在拉丁語學習權力的話。 現在他必須利用他的外國魔法，以奪回他在帝國的合法地位。在這個故事中有很多幽默和胡言亂語之間因為咒說中國人與外國口音和他畸形和權力飢餓雙胞胎。</p>
<p>Enraged by this Joe’s older twin 呪 sought revenge and cast Joe out of the empire at his first chance. This launched Joe to a strange and distant land known as the Roman Empire. While there Joe managed to learn words of power in Latin. Now he must utilize his foreign magic in order to take back his rightful place in the empire.Within this story there is a lot of space for humor and banter between Joe who speaks Chinese with a foreign accent and his malformed and power hungry twin.</p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAtUq_6nq6M?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>咒教學法 Learning with Joe</h3>
</div>
<div>然而，這個故事只是好上加好; 一個傳達希臘和拉丁語根源的環境，鼓勵玩家發展他們的詞典。 這是一個幾乎完全沒有開發的東西教西方語言的方法。 玩家和學生在玩這個遊戲後應該離開的概念是，當咒升級時，他們也會！</div>
<div> </div>
<p>However, the story is merely and icing on the cake; a context in which to convey Greek and Latin roots in a manner that will encourage players to develop their lexicons. This is an almost completely untapped method for teaching western languages in the east. The concept that players and students should come away with after playing this game is that as Joe levels up so do they!</p>

</div></div>","完整計劃！The Full Plan!
這個深入的影片將回答你有關於咒文的任何問題!This in depth video will answer any questions that you have about 咒文!


 
仁咒義蛋 The Enchanted Egg

玩家將扮演""咒""（Joe）的角色，這是一個巧妙的蛋黃，他的主人在他死前委託他保護帝國免受黑魔法。 然而，喬不是他主人第一次創造這樣一個監護人的嘗試。 原來的創作是""呪""，但他們的主人認為他是一個失敗的企圖。
The player will take the role of 咒 (Joe – Zhou), an enchanted egg yolk who was entrusted by his master before his death to protect the empire from dark magic. However, Joe was not his master’s first attempt at creating such a guardian. The original creation was 呪 (Zhou - the alternative form of the caracter 咒), however their master considered him to be a failed attempt. 
憤怒的這個咒的更老的雙胞胎尋求報復，把咒從他的第一次機會出帝國。 這把咒發射到一個被稱為羅馬帝國的奇怪和遙遠的土地上。 雖然有人咒設法在拉丁語學習權力的話。 現在他必須利用他的外國魔法，以奪回他在帝國的合法地位。在這個故事中有很多幽默和胡言亂語之間因為咒說中國人與外國口音和他畸形和權力飢餓雙胞胎。
Enraged by this Joe’s older twin 呪 sought revenge and cast Joe out of the empire at his first chance. This launched Joe to a strange and distant land known as the Roman Empire. While there Joe managed to learn words of power in Latin. Now he must utilize his foreign magic in order to take back his rightful place in the empire.Within this story there is a lot of space for humor and banter between Joe who speaks Chinese with a foreign accent and his malformed and power hungry twin.


 
咒教學法 Learning with Joe

然而，這個故事只是好上加好; 一個傳達希臘和拉丁語根源的環境，鼓勵玩家發展他們的詞典。 這是一個幾乎完全沒有開發的東西教西方語言的方法。 玩家和學生在玩這個遊戲後應該離開的概念是，當咒升級時，他們也會！
 
However, the story is merely and icing on the cake; a context in which to convey Greek and Latin roots in a manner that will encourage players to develop their lexicons. This is an almost completely untapped method for teaching western languages in the east. The concept that players and students should come away with after playing this game is that as Joe levels up so do they!
遊戲機制是為了做到這一點。 如果看看遊戲演示，將會看到幾個非常有趣的方面，推動玩家利用他們已經學到的所有內容。 在這些屏幕的頂部是一個線程，指示哪些敵人正在接近咒，除了怪物，還有魔法被施加在咒的方向。 咒可以利用任何需要的法術來打開一個敵人，打開類型字段通過按鈕""念咒""，這將打開一個在他面前的一個圓圈。
The gameplay mechanics are set up to do just that. If one looks at the game demo one will see several very interesting facets that push the players to utilize all that they have already learned. At the top of these screen is a thread that indicates which enemies are approaching Joe and besides monsters there are also magic spells being cast in Joe’s direction. Joe can utilize any spell he needs to take down a foe by opening the type field by hitting the button 念咒 (nianzhou – cast spell), this will open a circle in front of him.在特定的根中輸入一個具有與其意義相關的效果的法術。 例如，簡單的負前綴 ""anti""(抗), ""de""(低), ""dis""(反) 和 ""un""(無) 將導致損害。 然而，諸如 ""bene""(仁) 的法術將癒合並且""micro""(微) 將收縮和減慢傳入的敵人。Typing in a specific root will cast a spell with an effect associated with its meaning. For example simple negative prefixes such as anti-, de-, dis- and un- will cause damage. However a spell such as bene- would heal and micro- would shrink and slow an incoming enemy.
此外，在結束的水平和特定的敵人的老闆也將施放法術。 例如死靈法師會施放法術""死""，因此咒必須直接中和這個法術，使用拉丁當量法。 此外，""pryo(火)的等同物將是熱，""aqua""(水)，""multi""(多)，""mal""(惡)和""photo""(光) 。 可能性幾乎是無限的，因為希臘和拉丁語的根對與許多漢字相當好，因為它們都是古老的起源; 在某種意義上，中文是亞洲的拉丁文。

Moreover the boss at the end of the level and specific foes will also be casting spells. For instance a necromancer would be casting the spell 死 (se – death), therefore Joe must directly neutralize this spell with it’s Latin equivalent mort-. Furthermore the equivalent of 火(huo - fire) would be pyro-, 水(shui – water) aqua-, 多(duo – many) multi-, 惡(e – evil) mal- and 光(guang – light) photo-. The possibilities are nearly limitless, as Greek and Latin roots pair fairly nicely with many Chinese characters because they are both archaic in origin; and in a sense Chinese is the Latin of Asia.

看空格鍵，我們可以看到它用來傳達關於剛剛施放的法術的具體信息。 如根的名稱，法術的傷害和法術力費用。 這些水平將取決於使用法術的頻率，例如，如果玩家不斷輸入法術""anti-""，隨著時間的推移法術力費用將上升，損失輸出將下降。 這是遊戲中的一個關鍵因素，因為它鼓勵玩家循環通過他們的所有劇目中的所有法術，以完全有效地消耗法力和傷害敵人。
Looking at the spacebar one can see that it is used to convey specific information about the spell just cast. Such as the name of the root, the damage of the spell and the mana cost. These levels will very depending on the frequency in which a spell is used, for example if a player were to constantly type the spell anti- , over time the mana cost would rise and the damage output would fall. This is a key element in gameplay because it encourages the player to cycle through all of the spells in their repertoire in order to be completely efficient in spending mana and damaging enemies.

通過每個階段，玩家將面對一個結束老闆，這將丟棄紙張揭示下一階段的法術。 這個下一個咒文將被下一關的老闆重複施放，從而迫使玩家記住它的拉丁語。 隨著咒進一步向東移動，他將穿過中國的小鄉和城市，直到他到達國會大廈，他將在最後面對他的兄弟。
Through each stage players will face an end boss, which will drop a scrap of paper reveling the spell of the next stage. This next spell will be repeatedly cast by the boss of the next level and thus will force the player to memorize its Latin equivalent. As Joe moves further towards the east he will pass through towns and cities of China until he reaches the capitol where he will face his brother at long last.

<h3>Covenant</h3>
<p>Covenant is an upcoming SciFi/Dark Fantasy Action RPG set in an alternate history Medieval Europe where a pantheon of Lovecraftian Deities have invaded Earth and have taken up power as the new Gods of Mankind, set for release on PC and Mac OS.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493023808/ectjjzw1ceburzn6nzgb.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>The player is tasked with traversing through the domains of each God and liberating them from their oppressive rulers.  The game is inspired by similar action RPG's like Dark Souls or Bloodborne, but also aims to incorporate some strategy and management elements through Mount &amp; Blade-esque battle segments.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493023694/zgm9p8ti1vqpuarodu0m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Being a solo developer, everything you see on this page has been the result of me working 100% on my own, and while I have the drive and the talent to bring this game to fruition given enough time, in order to expedite development I need to bring on more professionals in the various fields that make up game development (ie. Coders, Musicians, additional Artists, Marketing People, etc.).  I also do most of my work on a pair of broken gaming laptops (not ideal, I've found), and new equipment is going to be necessary to complete development within a reasonable time-frame.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493023833/uuuh8lm2ovaayfquvxp7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Covenant is simply the type of game that I've always wanted to play myself; a SciFi/Dark Fantasy RPG with some Strategy and Management elements, think <i>Dark Souls</i> meets <i>Mount and Blade</i> with a little bit of base building thrown in for good measure.  And from what I've seen and heard from other gamers and genre enthusiasts, it seems to be the kind of game that a lot of people would want to play, and with financial backing Covenant has the potential to be a great game.  Any amount you might give would make an immense difference in helping to get Covenant's development off the ground.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493024399/pzgqyctd5okjyb2vcesp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Essentially there are 6 major components to what I need in order to complete Covenant;</p>
<ul>
<li>New Equipment : A proper Workstation-Grade desktop setup, a DSLR Camera for Photo-Scanning, Software Licenses, etc. ($8,000 allocated for these expenses)</li>
<li>Hiring Staff : Artists, Programmers, Musicians, etc. ($20,000 allocated for these expenses based on hourly rates, commissions, and work-for-hire costs) I'm looking to keep the dev team fairly small and intimate as not to have too many conflicts between members and ideas.</li>
<li>Legal Fees; Mainly to file the proper Copyrights and Trademarks, as well as forming an LLC. ($2,000 allocated for these expenses) </li>
<li>Fulfilling Backer Perks ($3,500 allocated for these expenses)</li>
<li>Marketing and Advertising ($3,000 allocated for these expenses)</li>
<li>Funds to offset living expenses ($13,500 allocated for these expenses)</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493022923/vrvyuhso2wn3nt9f0izn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If complete funding is not met, the funds that are gathered will be dispersed proportionately based on this model, and cheaper or lower-tier alternatives to services or equipment will be used to cut development costs in order to ensure that Covenant is brought to fruition, even if full funding isn't met.</p>
<p>Any surplus in funding will go towards adding console distribution for the Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch, and if those stretch goals are met any additional funding will be put towards online multiplayer, so you can pit your army against the armies of other players internationally.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are a number of different perks for whatever level of contribution you can make</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 - A special thank you with your name in the backers section of the game's credits </li>
<li>$5 - A special thanks, plus a custom message by you in the game's backer credits</li>
<li>$10 - A special thanks, message, and a pdf copy of the Art of Covenant digital art book</li>
<li>$20 - The previous two perks, plus a digital copy of the game upon release</li>
<li>$50 - A physical copy of the game, plus digital art book and soundtrack (credits and message tiers included)</li>
<li>$100 - A physical copy of the game with digital art book and soundtrack, plus a character figurine (credits and message tiers included)</li>
<li>$150 - A physical copy of the game, physical art book and soundtrack CD, plus the character figurine (credits and message tiers included)</li>
<li>$500 - All previous perks plus the opportunity to design your own enemy type to be featured in a special area of the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Managing a team and budget is always a challenge in terms of completing almost any project.  The greatest challenge will be completing development by my projected date, but I'm more concerned with producing a good game than a bad game completed on time, so even there are any hiccups during development, we'll keep on going until we produce a game we're satisfied with above all else.  I have a plan and a direction in which to take development, and </p>

Covenant is an upcoming SciFi/Dark Fantasy Action RPG set in an alternate history Medieval Europe where a pantheon of Lovecraftian Deities have invaded Earth and have taken up power as the new Gods of Mankind, set for release on PC and Mac OS.
 
The player is tasked with traversing through the domains of each God and liberating them from their oppressive rulers.  The game is inspired by similar action RPG's like Dark Souls or Bloodborne, but also aims to incorporate some strategy and management elements through Mount & Blade-esque battle segments.

Being a solo developer, everything you see on this page has been the result of me working 100% on my own, and while I have the drive and the talent to bring this game to fruition given enough time, in order to expedite development I need to bring on more professionals in the various fields that make up game development (ie. Coders, Musicians, additional Artists, Marketing People, etc.).  I also do most of my work on a pair of broken gaming laptops (not ideal, I've found), and new equipment is going to be necessary to complete development within a reasonable time-frame.

Covenant is simply the type of game that I've always wanted to play myself; a SciFi/Dark Fantasy RPG with some Strategy and Management elements, think Dark Souls meets Mount and Blade with a little bit of base building thrown in for good measure.  And from what I've seen and heard from other gamers and genre enthusiasts, it seems to be the kind of game that a lot of people would want to play, and with financial backing Covenant has the potential to be a great game.  Any amount you might give would make an immense difference in helping to get Covenant's development off the ground.


What We Need
Essentially there are 6 major components to what I need in order to complete Covenant;

New Equipment : A proper Workstation-Grade desktop setup, a DSLR Camera for Photo-Scanning, Software Licenses, etc. ($8,000 allocated for these expenses)
Hiring Staff : Artists, Programmers, Musicians, etc. ($20,000 allocated for these expenses based on hourly rates, commissions, and work-for-hire costs) I'm looking to keep the dev team fairly small and intimate as not to have too many conflicts between members and ideas.
Legal Fees; Mainly to file the proper Copyrights and Trademarks, as well as forming an LLC. ($2,000 allocated for these expenses) 
Fulfilling Backer Perks ($3,500 allocated for these expenses)
Marketing and Advertising ($3,000 allocated for these expenses)
Funds to offset living expenses ($13,500 allocated for these expenses)


If complete funding is not met, the funds that are gathered will be dispersed proportionately based on this model, and cheaper or lower-tier alternatives to services or equipment will be used to cut development costs in order to ensure that Covenant is brought to fruition, even if full funding isn't met.
Any surplus in funding will go towards adding console distribution for the Xbox One, PS4 and Nintendo Switch, and if those stretch goals are met any additional funding will be put towards online multiplayer, so you can pit your army against the armies of other players internationally.

What You Get
Here are a number of different perks for whatever level of contribution you can make

$1 - A special thank you with your name in the backers section of the game's credits 
$5 - A special thanks, plus a custom message by you in the game's backer credits
$10 - A special thanks, message, and a pdf copy of the Art of Covenant digital art book
$20 - The previous two perks, plus a digital copy of the game upon release
$50 - A physical copy of the game, plus digital art book and soundtrack (credits and message tiers included)
$100 - A physical copy of the game with digital art book and soundtrack, plus a character figurine (credits and message tiers included)
$150 - A physical copy of the game, physical art book and soundtrack CD, plus the character figurine (credits and message tiers included)
$500 - All previous perks plus the opportunity to design your own enemy type to be featured in a special area of the game.

Below is a mockup of the physical packaging, book, and figurine.


Risks & Challenges
Managing a team and budget is always a challenge in terms of completing almost any project.  The greatest challenge will be completing development by my projected date, but I'm more concerned with producing a good game than a bad game completed on time, so even there are any hiccups during development, we'll keep on going until we produce a game we're satisfied with above all else.  I have a plan and a direction in which to take development, and 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute monetarily or don't want to use this platform, you can help by spreading the word about Covenant.  If you're aware of any larger entities that might be interested in backing or helping Covenant reach its development funding goals please help bring the game to their attention, anything helps!

<h2>What is Rytmik Studio?</h2>
<p>Simply put, it's a music creation software based around a beautifully simple, yet wonderfully powerful concept. It’s flexible, instant and fun. Create a basic melody in a few steps, compose a great song in a few minutes, and show your musical flare with a whole range of instruments and effects. Rytmik Studio combines a step sequencer and a wavetable synthesizer. All this is supported by a built-in library with over 1200 samples, hundreds of instrument presets and dozens of sample songs. The results of your production can be instantly shared online, or exported to more traditional audio file formats. Rytmik Studio allows you to set different permissions and save songs to the Rytmik Cloud for users to enjoy, from simple playback and rating to remixing and collaborations. Take a song and watch how it evolves as it passes through the hands of more composers and their creative input.</p>

<h2>Why IndieGoGo?</h2>
<p>We have been developing games and applications for over 19 years. In 2010, we started developing the music application Rytmik for Nintendo DSi. Over time, we added new features and improved existing ones. As Rytmik grew, so did technology, and we took advantage of the more powerful hardware that became available. The latest version, Rytmik Ultimate, is available for Windows, MacOS, Nintendo 3DS, and iPad. We are now currently developing the third generation of Rytmik: <strong>Rytmik Studio</strong>.</p>
<p>The community behind Rytmik is growing, and we have two clear objectives. Firstly, we would like to complete Rytmik Studio sooner. Secondly, we want to involve the community in shaping the development itself. In today‘s digital age, a togetherness of development and community is essential for everybody. The new version of Rytmik Studio is now at a point where we can accelerate development, and we need your support to achieve this.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The older geeks out there might still remember “modules”, a once popular music format of the so-called trackers, which were widely used in 16-bit computers. We were also inspired by step sequencers and hardware grooveboxes. When you add a sophisticated synthesizer to the mix, you'll have an idea of what Rytmik Studio combines into one compact music creation toolkit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why choose Rytmik Studio?</h2>
<p>Most of the current music programs are very complex and deep. This is typically reflected in relatively high prices, and often in usability and steep learning curves.</p>
<p>We are heralding the return to the simplicity and playfulness of the first musical programs. Compact control and drag &amp; drop mechanics make it easy to learn and, importantly, to learn quickly. As in previous versions, <strong>Rytmik Studio is once again a unique tool for creating chiptunes, game soundtracks, and electronic music. </strong>Thanks to the new Rytmik Live mode, Rytmik Studio can now also be used for actual performance purposes.</p>
<p>Rytmik Studio is basically “building blocks” for music. We have built an accessible music kit  that overcomes limiting factors, and makes discovering new procedures a pleasure. Even a beginner can rapidly join the fun with ready-made clips, easily-changed parameters, and the ability to edit existing.</p>
<p>In addition, Rytmik Studio also allows professionals to delve deeper and create a stunning, complex song, completely managing the parameters of a flexible synthesizer and sound engine.</p>
<p><strong>Backward compatibility with Rytmik Ultimate</strong> allows you to open a song created in the previous version and enhance it with new features.</p>
<p>Rytmik Studio isn’t intended to compete with software used by major recording studios. Instead, by using modern technology, Rytmik brings back the days when music creation was fun. Rytmik Studio will be simply COOL!</p>

<h2>Rytmik Features</h2>
<h3>Basic features (for Rytmik Ultimate and Rytmik Studio)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wavetable Synth</strong> – The core of the sound engine is a wavetable synthesizer that generates audio by playing sound samples. Rytmik incorporates 16 of these synthesizers.</li>
<li>
<strong>Drawable Waveform Synth</strong> – The wavetable synth enables users to draw short customized samples for unique results.</li>
<li>
<strong>Over 1200 Instrument Samples</strong> – drums, bass, percussion, guitars, strings, pianos, melodic instruments, synthetic instruments, pads, vocals, effects, and much more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Step Sequencer </strong>– The workspace in Rytmik consists of “clips”. In each clip there are four instruments, along with the note sequences assigned to them. Four clips can play simultaneously. Clips can be assembled into tracks, and are easily moved and copied using intuitive drag &amp; drop technique – as simple as building blocks for music.</li>
<li>
<strong>Modulation Parameters</strong> – Every note in the Step Sequencer can determine the pitch and volume of the tone, and can additionally control up to three other parameters of the synthesizer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound Effects</strong> – Easily implement sound-changing effects with <strong>ADSR Envelope, Glide, Digital Delay, Noise Shaper, Sample Offset and Loop Definition</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Selection of Sample Songs</strong> – Play, analyze, modify and enjoy!</li>
<li>
<strong>Export </strong>– Save your finished songs in WAV and MP3 formats.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sharing via Rytmik Cloud</strong> – Instantly share Rytmik songs with a community of users and gain access to thousands of other songs. With management tools and a range of permission settings, songs can be locked down or completely open, allowing for a creative world of musical exploration, solo remixing, group collaborations, and much more. Discover, play and rate songs all across the Rytmik Charts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>NEW in Rytmik Studio</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Advanced Sound Effects</strong> – Fine and dramatic sound editing with <strong>EQ3, Resonant Filter, Drive, Bright, Modelay, Modulation Matrix, 2× ADSR and 2× LFO with optional target modulation, 4× Send, and Sidechain Compression.</strong> ADSR envelopes and LFOs can continuously change a variety of instrument and effect parameters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Automation</strong> – Draw automation curves within songs that smoothly control instruments and effects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Instrument Presets</strong> – Play with an advanced synth! Choose from hundreds of named presets across multiple categories, and create all-new custom presets.<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aVdJrhqsqc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
</li>
<li>
<strong>MIDI Input </strong>– Rytmik is compatible with standard MIDI keyboards.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sidechain</strong> – A must-have tool, especially for contemporary dance and electronic music. Automatically muffle one sound with another (such as a bass with a kick drum). Using these tools makes effects like the “pulsing” in dance music very quick and easy to produce in Rytmik Studio.</li>
<li>
<strong>Global Sound Effects</strong> – Using the <strong>2× Stereo Reverb, 2× Stereo Delay, Master EQ and Limiter</strong>, each instrument can be sent into two reverbs and two delays. From short and simple sound you can create a long vibrant range, or simply deliver the drum width and space. The final output of the sound engine can be further adjusted by the equalizer. Dynamics is controlled by a limiter (also works in multiband mode).</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom Samples</strong> – Rytmik Studio includes a generous number of samples, and also allows you to import new ones freely. Record vocals, instruments and other sources, and seamlessly add these samples into the custom library.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live Performance</strong> – Rytmik Studio Live Mode is specially designed for stage performance. Quickly and dynamically change and control songs play, and take full control of effects directly on groups of instruments.</li>
</ul>

Rytmik Cloud was launched in 2015 as a dedicated cloud storage solution where composers can share, rate, and edit each other’s works. At Cinemax, we also feature the most interesting songs every month, airing them on a YouTube channel. <strong>Check out  the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo1AZuHWyAE&amp;list=PLrF8bdTCiuf4LQ-nLRb6gY0lZC4pIDj3Z&amp;index=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Featured Songs</a>!</strong> We genuinely listen to every published piece, music is in our blood.

The application became popular very quickly. The Nintendo DSi console only had 16MB RAM, so it wasn’t possible to add new instruments to expand on the previous version. Instead, we released new versions that focused on different musical styles. Each version always included new features, and over the course of several years we released five editions: Rytmik, Rytmik: Rock Edition, Rytmik: Hip Hop King, Rytmik: Retrobits and Rytmik: World Music.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506097257/dbtuyq6doln8394kksgz.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Second Generation (2015)</h3><p>Moving to more powerful platforms has allowed us to improve the sound engine and add more features. The philosophy of Rytmik is based on the immediate display of parameter changes. All instruments are instantly available – they are loaded into memory when the application is started. With the transition to new platforms (PC, Mac, Apple iPad, Nintendo 3DS), the limited memory restriction disappeared. Rytmik Ultimate released in 2015, and contains most of the previous versions. In addition, two instrument expansions (or “DLCs” as they’re often known) are available for the desktop version. The same applies for the Rytmik Ultimate Complete version for iPad. The total number of music samples has now reached 1230. In addition, there are 400 words sampled by a robotic voice and a female voice. Rytmik Ultimate also delivered the unique way to share songs with the introduction of Rytmik Cloud. The community of composers has publicly shared more than 7300 songs across platforms! Every composer can offer their own songs for editing, and can of course contribute to other remixes.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506097280/wf9nzvpen7ofcgeinyey.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Evolution</h3><p>Check out the 8 year evolution of Rytmik in detail <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4PaG7z1Zwq7RGRNZ1pkd3ppSzQ/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4PaG7z1Zwq7RGRNZ1pkd3ppSzQ/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506097294/ebq3gi21iathp24qajgg.png"" src=""""/></a></p><h3>Third Generation (2017)</h3><p>Rytmik Studio.

Wavetable Synth – The core of the sound engine is a wavetable synthesizer that generates audio by playing sound samples. Rytmik incorporates 16 of these synthesizers.

Drawable Waveform Synth – The wavetable synth enables users to draw short customized samples for unique results.

Over 1200 Instrument Samples – drums, bass, percussion, guitars, strings, pianos, melodic instruments, synthetic instruments, pads, vocals, effects, and much more.

Step Sequencer – The workspace in Rytmik consists of “clips”. In each clip there are four instruments, along with the note sequences assigned to them. Four clips can play simultaneously. Clips can be assembled into tracks, and are easily moved and copied using intuitive drag & drop technique – as simple as building blocks for music.

Modulation Parameters – Every note in the Step Sequencer can determine the pitch and volume of the tone, and can additionally control up to three other parameters of the synthesizer.

Sound Effects – Easily implement sound-changing effects with ADSR Envelope, Glide, Digital Delay, Noise Shaper, Sample Offset and Loop Definition.

Selection of Sample Songs – Play, analyze, modify and enjoy!

Export – Save your finished songs in WAV and MP3 formats.

Sharing via Rytmik Cloud – Instantly share Rytmik songs with a community of users and gain access to thousands of other songs. With management tools and a range of permission settings, songs can be locked down or completely open, allowing for a creative world of musical exploration, solo remixing, group collaborations, and much more. Discover, play and rate songs all across the Rytmik Charts.

NEW in Rytmik Studio


Advanced Sound Effects – Fine and dramatic sound editing with EQ3, Resonant Filter, Drive, Bright, Modelay, Modulation Matrix, 2× ADSR and 2× LFO with optional target modulation, 4× Send, and Sidechain Compression. ADSR envelopes and LFOs can continuously change a variety of instrument and effect parameters.

Automation – Draw automation curves within songs that smoothly control instruments and effects.

Instrument Presets – Play with an advanced synth! Choose from hundreds of named presets across multiple categories, and create all-new custom presets.


MIDI Input – Rytmik is compatible with standard MIDI keyboards.

Sidechain – A must-have tool, especially for contemporary dance and electronic music. Automatically muffle one sound with another (such as a bass with a kick drum). Using these tools makes effects like the “pulsing” in dance music very quick and easy to produce in Rytmik Studio.

Global Sound Effects – Using the 2× Stereo Reverb, 2× Stereo Delay, Master EQ and Limiter, each instrument can be sent into two reverbs and two delays. From short and simple sound you can create a long vibrant range, or simply deliver the drum width and space. The final output of the sound engine can be further adjusted by the equalizer. Dynamics is controlled by a limiter (also works in multiband mode).

Custom Samples – Rytmik Studio includes a generous number of samples, and also allows you to import new ones freely. Record vocals, instruments and other sources, and seamlessly add these samples into the custom library.

Live Performance – Rytmik Studio Live Mode is specially designed for stage performance. Quickly and dynamically change and control songs play, and take full control of effects directly on groups of instruments.

 
How Rytmik Studio worksFor a detailed idea of how the program works, we have prepared a new sound engine scheme HERE, and for comparison the previous version is HERE.Rytmik LiveRytmik Studio Live Mode is specially designed for stage performance. Quickly and dynamically change and control track play, and take full control of effects directly on groups of instruments. Create – Rehearse – Perform! Community and Rytmik CloudThe first Rytmik was released in 2010, composers have mainly been publishing their work through YouTube videos, even despite the fact that recording Nintendo DSi was a major technical complication. Rytmik Cloud was launched in 2015 as a dedicated cloud storage solution where composers can share, rate, and edit each other’s works. At Cinemax, we also feature the most interesting songs every month, airing them on a YouTube channel. Check out  the Featured Songs! We genuinely listen to every published piece, music is in our blood. The community has also prepared a continuous stream of music compiled from the best songs. Join in and listen to featured songs over the internet with Rytmik Radio, and for those who want to get acquainted with all the songs (that’s over 7,300!), there's the free Rytmik Player. Music is for sharing. Hear it, rate it, live it!History of RytmikFirst Generation (2010)It all started in 2010, when we released the first version on the Nintendo DSiWare platform. The application became popular very quickly. The Nintendo DSi console only had 16MB RAM, so it wasn’t possible to add new instruments to expand on the previous version. Instead, we released new versions that focused on different musical styles. Each version always included new features, and over the course of several years we released five editions: Rytmik, Rytmik: Rock Edition, Rytmik: Hip Hop King, Rytmik: Retrobits and Rytmik: World Music. Second Generation (2015)Moving to more powerful platforms has allowed us to improve the sound engine and add more features. The philosophy of Rytmik is based on the immediate display of parameter changes. All instruments are instantly available – they are loaded into memory when the application is started. With the transition to new platforms (PC, Mac, Apple iPad, Nintendo 3DS), the limited memory restriction disappeared. Rytmik Ultimate released in 2015, and contains most of the previous versions. In addition, two instrument expansions (or “DLCs” as they’re often known) are available for the desktop version. The same applies for the Rytmik Ultimate Complete version for iPad. The total number of music samples has now reached 1230. In addition, there are 400 words sampled by a robotic voice and a female voice. Rytmik Ultimate also delivered the unique way to share songs with the introduction of Rytmik Cloud. The community of composers has publicly shared more than 7300 songs across platforms! Every composer can offer their own songs for editing, and can of course contribute to other remixes.EvolutionCheck out the 8 year evolution of Rytmik in detail HERE.Third Generation (2017)Rytmik Studio. That's what we are working on, and you can now support it. The jump between the second and the third generation is huge. For more specific information, please see the list of features and the description of the internal architecture of our sound engine. We are currently developing this version for PC and Mac. It will be available on Steam in Early Access later this year. The final version of Rytmik Studio will be available in 2018.History of CINEMAXThe studio was founded in 1998. In its history, it has fully developed and contributed to games and applications for PC, Nintendo, iOS and Mac. Titles include the RPG Inquisitor, arcade game Gumboy Crazy Adventure, and of course, the complete Rytmik franchise. More information at http://cinemax.cz. FAQ When will the final version be ready?Rytmik Studio for PC / Mac will be released in 2018. Early Access is scheduled for late this year.How much Rytmik Studio will be on Steam?Rytmik Studio will be priced at 27.99 EUR / 29.99 USD and the Rytmik Live expansion will be 7.99 EUR / 7.99 USD.Are you planning a Nintendo Switch version?Yes. The version for Nintendo Switch will be released in 2018.Is it possible to use the songs created in Rytmik Studio for commercial purposes?If you are the author of the music, then nothing prevents you from doing so. You can use Rytmik, for example, for making your own album, adding audio to videos, making a soundtrack for a YouTube channel, creating effects and tunes for a computer game, etc. The use of a cover version or a remix of foreign songs is governed by classic copyright. Please note that if you are not the author of the material, then we advise that you request the owner’s permission prior to any commercial usage.Are you planning for PS4 or Xbox ONE versions?The Rytmik application contains a large number of controls is on a very small area. This is ideal for touch control navigation. Keyboard and mouse controls are also very effective. Implementing similar usability for home consoles is not quite as intuitive, and that is why we do not plan to release on these platforms yet, but we definitely open to doing so in the future.",13.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><i><b>One
hundred years ago all hell broke loose, literally. Massive planar
gates appeared and hordes of what looked like angels and demons
poured through, to wage war on each other with humanity caught in the
middle...<br/><br/>Mankind struggled greatly in the war. Angels used us
as demon fodder, while the demons enslaved us. Though in some ways we
had greater technology, physically we were weak in comparison. The
best scientists at Genetix Corp. began working on a mutagen to make
the common man into a juggernaut. Instead, what we got were diseased
humans with an inability to feel pain, an endless rage, and a taste
for flesh....<br/><br/>With our armies decimated, and cities ravaged by
the sickness, the world leaders decided that if we can't win, no one
wins. Nuclear weapons were detonated in all the plagued cities, and
at all the planar gates. The war was over, and mankind clung to life
in a new world fraught with danger...</b></i></p>In 2011, Cody Bellinger began the construction of a new tabletop RPG system - one focused on realistic play, exciting roleplaying, and gritty adventure - which he named Apocalypse. He began his work with influences from many other games and systems, including Dungeons and Dragons, Paranoia, and Fallout, but the first version of the product he unveiled was a creature entirely of his own making. With the help of his gaming circle, he began to revise and refine the system through discussion and playtesting, expanding it to a set of rules that could be used in a variety of ways in multiple settings.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, tragedy struck in January 2013 as Cody unexpectedly passed away due to an aortic hemorrhage at only 23 years of age. The gaming group splintered due to the tragedy, and no progress was made on the game, with the pain of Cody's loss too near to the hearts of those who knew him.<br/><br/>In April of 2015, knowing that Cody would want his game played, one of the regular gamemasters of the previous group took the effort to recover Cody's documentation and begin his work again, discussing the rules and settings not only with the previous gaming group, but with a new group that had grown in the intervening years, and restarted playtesting. Combining the documents that Cody had already constructed with notes and thoughts shared through private messaging prior to Cody's untimely death, refinement and development began anew.<br/><br/>With permission from Cody's mother (who, in her own right, has always acted as Group Mom for this myriad group of 20-somethings), we hope to complete the production of Apocalypse and the publication of the new system, both as a memorial to Cody's work and a fresh new take on d20 tabletop gaming for the gaming community. Now we just need your help to make this project of Cody's into a legacy. </div><div><br/></div><div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Apocalypse is a d20 game, but it's <b>unlike any other popular d20 game currently on the market</b>. While it contains elements of this staple of tabletopping that will be familiar to many in the community, it not only brings a fresh, new setting into ready availability, but is designed around real-world actions, effects, and consequences.<br/><br/>Apocalypse is played in the post-apocalyptic world following the events described above, and as such, is a challenging, exciting, and potentially lethal system. Whether you're dealing with shotgun-toting raiders in trucks or you're going toe to toe with a demon behemoth, every choice has the potential to bring dire consequences or great rewards. <br/><br/>With a new approach to weapon, armor, and character design mechanics comes a laundry list of potential combinations of randomized mutations, class-based powers, and unique abilities. Even the landscape can prove dangerous, as radiation effects and environmental shifts due to the apocalypse can surprise even the most careful adventurers.<br/><br/>Apocalypse mechanics use  a logical, real-world approach to armor functionality (lessening and abating damage received rather than simply making a character harder to hit), weaponry (do you want the shotgun, or the missile launcher?), vehicles, basic equipment, and more. </p>
<p>This kind of ingenuity of design is not limited just to the setting, The basic rules of the system and its integral workings bring a new perspective into tabletop RPGs, with aspects of the system designed to make actions, story, and even equipment and gear not only more logical, but easier to work with, easier for beginners to understand, and more realistic, allowing for deeper immersion and abundant excitement for players. The flexibility of the system itself also allows for more creative actions, allowing players to be simplistic and straightforward, or even take inspiration from action movie heroes and tropes.<br/><br/>The storyline is well-developed and its seamless integration with the system allows for players to <b>build their own style of play</b> without being disruptive, whether they're focused mainly on the combat aspects and mechanics of the game or on the roleplaying aspects of tabletop gaming.</p>
<p><b>Apocalypse is the new tabletop that the gaming community needs</b>, and will provide hours, days, or even years of fun to its players.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What Makes Apocalypse Different?</h3>There are a lot of facets that make Apocalypse revolutionary when it comes to tabletop gaming. Obviously, we'd like to keep some of those things back for release so that people who acquire a set of books post-publication (either through a donation perk or through purchase) will have new discoveries to make, but here are some of the awesome parts of what sets Apocalypse apart:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Apocalypse has a well-developed, in-depth setting. It contains fully fleshed out stories, NPCs with years of background, and an explanation for anything and everything the players may encounter - but the things the players encounter are varied, story-rich, and detailed.</li>
<li>The setting is also highly immersive. While other games give you cool abilities, strange powers, and world-shaking items, Apocalypse is driven on making you feel these things are plausible. Through simplicity and the reality-based design of the mechanics and setting, Apocalypse doesn't have the issue of many other tabletop games where the abilities seem too far-fetched for player grasp and comprehension. Players could even start the game as literal copies of themselves, if they really wished. However, powers and abilities are still fantastical, adventurous, and powerful enough to make the game fun.</li>
<li>Another major facet of the Apocalypse system is that it's highly adaptable. Whether the concern is with adaptability to GM designs, player-created situations, or even other setting designs, the system is designed in a way to allow it to be catered to anyone's preferences.</li>
<li>Similarly to the system itself, classes and abilities are highly customizable. There is no “best build,” or preferred class design. All of the characters are unique, and even part of the system is designed to ensure this, as character mutations are acquired through random rolls by the GM.</li>
<li>Mutations themselves are a definite point of interest, because Apocalypse has a list of possible mutations rivaling comic book worlds, but all are designed in such a way to be useful and usable in the game, and the mechanics allow them to function in highly plausible ways.</li>
<li>The fact is, Apocalypse is meant to be played much like an action movie. From shoving a shotgun down a demon's throat, to playing hot potato with a live semtex grenade, the system is built to handle any creative playing idea that players come up with, or that a GM wants to throw in.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few of the unique aspects that set Apocalypse apart, and hopefully they're attractive features for potential users. People who wish to keep up with some of the more detailed aspects of the system's construction and development are also free to follow the Apocalypse team <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ApocalypseTabletop"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Facebook</b></a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ApocDevTeam"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Twitter</b></a>, and <b><a href=""http://apocalypsedevelopment.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tumblr blog</a></b>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>While $50,000 may seem like a lofty goal, we have some pretty big plans to make Apocalypse into what Cody originally envisioned. We hope to produce and publish a full-length, hardback Apocalypse Core Book on a wide scale, complete with illustrations, information about the rules, the methods of play, the classes, and a full exposition of the factions, settings, and ongoing events of the world of Apocalypse. If we exceed that goal, we'll even begin working on supplemental materials immediately.</p> <ul> <li>A major part of our planned budget is for <b>illustrations</b>, both sketched and fully detailed color images. With around 120 images planned, this part of our budget is roughly $15,000.</li>
<li>Another important aspect of a core rulebook is the <b>cartography</b>. From setting topography and cityscapes to detailed graphs and dungeons, maps are an integral component of any good tabletop RPG. We plan to hire the best cartographer(s) we can afford, to add these important elements. This part of our budget is also set at $15,000.</li>
<li>Of course, <b>publication</b> is a major aspect of our plan for Apocalypse. We hope to self-publish through a respectable publishing agency that focuses on game publication. To that end, we have set aside $5,000 in our budget based on our research into publishers and the packages offered by the company we hope to engage.</li> <li>
<b>Writing and editing</b> costs are not inexpensive, and while Cody began fleshing out the setting, there is still much to be done. Part of the production team is already made up of freelance writers and editors, and so we hope to gain their full focus on this project - but that comes at the expense of any other projects which they might otherwise undertake. We hope to use $5,000 to $10,000 to fairly compensate them for their time and efforts exclusively on this project, as well as the time and efforts of the R&amp;D team and designers.</li> <li>The remaining $5,000 to $10,000 of the original $50,000 goal will be used to <b>trademark and copyright</b> the Apocalypse game, setting and related materials, as well as being used for <b>marketing</b> beyond the original marketing materials granted by the publication company's package. Any remainder will be used to offset the cost of <b>playtesting,</b> including the printing of pre-publication manuscripts and materials, project-specific transportation costs, and other assorted project-specific costs.<br/>
</li> </ul>
<div>That's how our plan for the money usage breaks down, but we also plan to provide our contributors with some fun perks for contributions.  Contributors of various levels can get the following awesome rewards:<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>An NPC</b> designed according to your specifications (within the game rules) and placed permanently in the setting of Apocalypse.</li>
<li>A <b>hardback copy</b> of the <b>Apocalypse Core Book</b> from the first edition printing, <b>signed</b> by the development leads (even including a copy of <b>Cody's signature</b>).</li>
<li>An unsigned <b>hardback copy</b> of the <b>Apocalypse Core Book</b> </li>
<li>A 36"" x 24"" laminated color <b>poster</b> of the Apocalypse Core Setting map.</li>
<li>
<b>A Township</b> in the Apocalypse Core Setting named according to either your name or your choice of name (within the reasonable confines of the setting).</li>
<li>Your name in the <b>Design Motivators</b> section of the Apocalypse Core Book credits.</li>
<li>
<b>A PDF copy</b> of the Apocalypse Core Book.</li>
<li>Your name in the <b>Contributors</b> section of the Apocalypse Core Book credits.</li>
<li>Your name in the <b>Special Thanks</b> section of the Apocalypse Core Book credits.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>We also have plans in place for <b>Stretch Goals</b> and new <b>Perks for Stretch Goal Completion</b>, which we will unveil at appropriate times during the campaign.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>With any ongoing project, there are natural challenges and obstacles to overcome, and in this aspect, Apocalypse is no different.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The fact is, Apocalypse <i>is </i>a d20 system. There are many others, and one of the challenges we hope to overcome with the help of this campaign is that <b>Apocalypse is being birthed into a field of competition</b> with long-established systems of other types. We hope to use part of the money raised by this campaign, as mentioned, to aid in marketing both pre- and post-publication.<br/>
</li>
<li>In the same vein, <b>exposure is a major factor</b>. Part of the reason our publication budget is so high (and may even end up taking a larger portion of the funds than we've already planned) is because we want to make sure that we start out with enough copies of the first edition of the Apocalypse Core Book to have a decently wide original distribution base.</li>
<li>While Cody designed something great in the Apocalypse system, he wasn't the best at <b>organizing and fully updating </b>his material. It has already taken countless hours and multiple people working very hard to re-organize the things that he left us, as well as incorporating the various private messages, notes, and random memories we have from gaming sessions into the rules and setting. This effort will be constant and ongoing, and poses a difficult challenge to all the designers and writers. This challenge and the time and effort to overcome it will be aided not only by the fact that we have several professional writers in the development team, but also they will be able to devote more time and effort if they are not sacrificing income to do so through payment from the campaign.</li>
<li>
<b>Playtesting</b> is an important aspect of the development process. From its inception, Apocalypse has been best refined by playing short campaigns and game sessions to test out the rules and features of the game. Playtesting itself, however, poses an interesting set of challenges. Character sheets, copies of the rules, and other materials needed to properly test the system all have a monetary cost, which can be offset by this campaign. Of course, organizing times and putting in the effort to actually refine the game (rather than simply playing a broken system) are challenges in and of themselves, but most of our group has been playing tabletop games for years, if not decades, and we are uniquely suited to undertake this development not only because of that, but because of our blend of skills and education and training.</li>
<li>Finding<b> illustrators and cartographers</b> willing to join the project is obviously a challenge, that carries with it a set of risks - getting quality work in a timely fashion will never be inexpensive - and we hope to use a large portion of the funding to compensate such artists fairly.

</div></div>","The Story Behind Apocalypse 
One
hundred years ago all hell broke loose, literally. Massive planar
gates appeared and hordes of what looked like angels and demons
poured through, to wage war on each other with humanity caught in the
middle...Mankind struggled greatly in the war. Angels used us
as demon fodder, while the demons enslaved us. Though in some ways we
had greater technology, physically we were weak in comparison. The
best scientists at Genetix Corp. began working on a mutagen to make
the common man into a juggernaut. Instead, what we got were diseased
humans with an inability to feel pain, an endless rage, and a taste
for flesh....With our armies decimated, and cities ravaged by
the sickness, the world leaders decided that if we can't win, no one
wins. Nuclear weapons were detonated in all the plagued cities, and
at all the planar gates. The war was over, and mankind clung to life
in a new world fraught with danger...In 2011, Cody Bellinger began the construction of a new tabletop RPG system - one focused on realistic play, exciting roleplaying, and gritty adventure - which he named Apocalypse. He began his work with influences from many other games and systems, including Dungeons and Dragons, Paranoia, and Fallout, but the first version of the product he unveiled was a creature entirely of his own making. With the help of his gaming circle, he began to revise and refine the system through discussion and playtesting, expanding it to a set of rules that could be used in a variety of ways in multiple settings.Unfortunately, tragedy struck in January 2013 as Cody unexpectedly passed away due to an aortic hemorrhage at only 23 years of age. The gaming group splintered due to the tragedy, and no progress was made on the game, with the pain of Cody's loss too near to the hearts of those who knew him.In April of 2015, knowing that Cody would want his game played, one of the regular gamemasters of the previous group took the effort to recover Cody's documentation and begin his work again, discussing the rules and settings not only with the previous gaming group, but with a new group that had grown in the intervening years, and restarted playtesting. Combining the documents that Cody had already constructed with notes and thoughts shared through private messaging prior to Cody's untimely death, refinement and development began anew.With permission from Cody's mother (who, in her own right, has always acted as Group Mom for this myriad group of 20-somethings), we hope to complete the production of Apocalypse and the publication of the new system, both as a memorial to Cody's work and a fresh new take on d20 tabletop gaming for the gaming community. Now we just need your help to make this project of Cody's into a legacy. 



The Impact
Apocalypse is a d20 game, but it's unlike any other popular d20 game currently on the market. While it contains elements of this staple of tabletopping that will be familiar to many in the community, it not only brings a fresh, new setting into ready availability, but is designed around real-world actions, effects, and consequences.Apocalypse is played in the post-apocalyptic world following the events described above, and as such, is a challenging, exciting, and potentially lethal system. Whether you're dealing with shotgun-toting raiders in trucks or you're going toe to toe with a demon behemoth, every choice has the potential to bring dire consequences or great rewards. With a new approach to weapon, armor, and character design mechanics comes a laundry list of potential combinations of randomized mutations, class-based powers, and unique abilities. Even the landscape can prove dangerous, as radiation effects and environmental shifts due to the apocalypse can surprise even the most careful adventurers.Apocalypse mechanics use  a logical, real-world approach to armor functionality (lessening and abating damage received rather than simply making a character harder to hit), weaponry (do you want the shotgun, or the missile launcher?), vehicles, basic equipment, and more. 
This kind of ingenuity of design is not limited just to the setting, The basic rules of the system and its integral workings bring a new perspective into tabletop RPGs, with aspects of the system designed to make actions, story, and even equipment and gear not only more logical, but easier to work with, easier for beginners to understand, and more realistic, allowing for deeper immersion and abundant excitement for players. The flexibility of the system itself also allows for more creative actions, allowing players to be simplistic and straightforward, or even take inspiration from action movie heroes and tropes.The storyline is well-developed and its seamless integration with the system allows for players to build their own style of play without being disruptive, whether they're focused mainly on the combat aspects and mechanics of the game or on the roleplaying aspects of tabletop gaming.
Apocalypse is the new tabletop that the gaming community needs, and will provide hours, days, or even years of fun to its players.

What Makes Apocalypse Different?There are a lot of facets that make Apocalypse revolutionary when it comes to tabletop gaming. Obviously, we'd like to keep some of those things back for release so that people who acquire a set of books post-publication (either through a donation perk or through purchase) will have new discoveries to make, but here are some of the awesome parts of what sets Apocalypse apart:
Apocalypse has a well-developed, in-depth setting. It contains fully fleshed out stories, NPCs with years of background, and an explanation for anything and everything the players may encounter - but the things the players encounter are varied, story-rich, and detailed.
The setting is also highly immersive. While other games give you cool abilities, strange powers, and world-shaking items, Apocalypse is driven on making you feel these things are plausible. Through simplicity and the reality-based design of the mechanics and setting, Apocalypse doesn't have the issue of many other tabletop games where the abilities seem too far-fetched for player grasp and comprehension. Players could even start the game as literal copies of themselves, if they really wished. However, powers and abilities are still fantastical, adventurous, and powerful enough to make the game fun.
Another major facet of the Apocalypse system is that it's highly adaptable. Whether the concern is with adaptability to GM designs, player-created situations, or even other setting designs, the system is designed in a way to allow it to be catered to anyone's preferences.
Similarly to the system itself, classes and abilities are highly customizable. There is no “best build,” or preferred class design. All of the characters are unique, and even part of the system is designed to ensure this, as character mutations are acquired through random rolls by the GM.
Mutations themselves are a definite point of interest, because Apocalypse has a list of possible mutations rivaling comic book worlds, but all are designed in such a way to be useful and usable in the game, and the mechanics allow them to function in highly plausible ways.
The fact is, Apocalypse is meant to be played much like an action movie. From shoving a shotgun down a demon's throat, to playing hot potato with a live semtex grenade, the system is built to handle any creative playing idea that players come up with, or that a GM wants to throw in.

These are just a few of the unique aspects that set Apocalypse apart, and hopefully they're attractive features for potential users. People who wish to keep up with some of the more detailed aspects of the system's construction and development are also free to follow the Apocalypse team Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr blog.


What We Need & What You Get While $50,000 may seem like a lofty goal, we have some pretty big plans to make Apocalypse into what Cody originally envisioned. We hope to produce and publish a full-length, hardback Apocalypse Core Book on a wide scale, complete with illustrations, information about the rules, the methods of play, the classes, and a full exposition of the factions, settings, and ongoing events of the world of Apocalypse. If we exceed that goal, we'll even begin working on supplemental materials immediately.  A major part of our planned budget is for illustrations, both sketched and fully detailed color images. With around 120 images planned, this part of our budget is roughly $15,000.
Another important aspect of a core rulebook is the cartography. From setting topography and cityscapes to detailed graphs and dungeons, maps are an integral component of any good tabletop RPG. We plan to hire the best cartographer(s) we can afford, to add these important elements. This part of our budget is also set at $15,000.
Of course, publication is a major aspect of our plan for Apocalypse. We hope to self-publish through a respectable publishing agency that focuses on game publication. To that end, we have set aside $5,000 in our budget based on our research into publishers and the packages offered by the company we hope to engage. 
Writing and editing costs are not inexpensive, and while Cody began fleshing out the setting, there is still much to be done. Part of the production team is already made up of freelance writers and editors, and so we hope to gain their full focus on this project - but that comes at the expense of any other projects which they might otherwise undertake. We hope to use $5,000 to $10,000 to fairly compensate them for their time and efforts exclusively on this project, as well as the time and efforts of the R&D team and designers. The remaining $5,000 to $10,000 of the original $50,000 goal will be used to trademark and copyright the Apocalypse game, setting and related materials, as well as being used for marketing beyond the original marketing materials granted by the publication company's package. Any remainder will be used to offset the cost of playtesting, including the printing of pre-publication manuscripts and materials, project-specific transportation costs, and other assorted project-specific costs.
 
That's how our plan for the money usage breaks down, but we also plan to provide our contributors with some fun perks for contributions.  Contributors of various levels can get the following awesome rewards:




An NPC designed according to your specifications (within the game rules) and placed permanently in the setting of Apocalypse.
A hardback copy of the Apocalypse Core Book from the first edition printing, signed by the development leads (even including a copy of Cody's signature).
An unsigned hardback copy of the Apocalypse Core Book 
A 36"" x 24"" laminated color poster of the Apocalypse Core Setting map.

A Township in the Apocalypse Core Setting named according to either your name or your choice of name (within the reasonable confines of the setting).
Your name in the Design Motivators section of the Apocalypse Core Book credits.

A PDF copy of the Apocalypse Core Book.
Your name in the Contributors section of the Apocalypse Core Book credits.
Your name in the Special Thanks section of the Apocalypse Core Book credits.


We also have plans in place for Stretch Goals and new Perks for Stretch Goal Completion, which we will unveil at appropriate times during the campaign.




    Risks & Challenges With any ongoing project, there are natural challenges and obstacles to overcome, and in this aspect, Apocalypse is no different.


The fact is, Apocalypse is a d20 system. There are many others, and one of the challenges we hope to overcome with the help of this campaign is that Apocalypse is being birthed into a field of competition with long-established systems of other types. We hope to use part of the money raised by this campaign, as mentioned, to aid in marketing both pre- and post-publication.

In the same vein, exposure is a major factor. Part of the reason our publication budget is so high (and may even end up taking a larger portion of the funds than we've already planned) is because we want to make sure that we start out with enough copies of the first edition of the Apocalypse Core Book to have a decently wide original distribution base.
While Cody designed something great in the Apocalypse system, he wasn't the best at organizing and fully updating his material. It has already taken countless hours and multiple people working very hard to re-organize the things that he left us, as well as incorporating the various private messages, notes, and random memories we have from gaming sessions into the rules and setting. This effort will be constant and ongoing, and poses a difficult challenge to all the designers and writers. This challenge and the time and effort to overcome it will be aided not only by the fact that we have several professional writers in the development team, but also they will be able to devote more time and effort if they are not sacrificing income to do so through payment from the campaign.

Playtesting is an important aspect of the development process. From its inception, Apocalypse has been best refined by playing short campaigns and game sessions to test out the rules and features of the game. Playtesting itself, however, poses an interesting set of challenges. Character sheets, copies of the rules, and other materials needed to properly test the system all have a monetary cost, which can be offset by this campaign. Of course, organizing times and putting in the effort to actually refine the game (rather than simply playing a broken system) are challenges in and of themselves, but most of our group has been playing tabletop games for years, if not decades, and we are uniquely suited to undertake this development not only because of that, but because of our blend of skills and education and training.
Finding illustrators and cartographers willing to join the project is obviously a challenge, that carries with it a set of risks - getting quality work in a timely fashion will never be inexpensive - and we hope to use a large portion of the funding to compensate such artists fairly. There is a long-standing saying that there are three categories of work: fast, cheap, and good, and you can only pick two. We hope to be able to get high quality artwork delivered quickly, but we know this will not come at a low rate of pay. The development team behind Apocalypse is well connected in both the online and local artistic communities, and so we have a variety of artists to approach, but we'll need help from this funding campaign to ensure that the artists are fairly compensated for their work.




Scheduling


We are launching this Indiegogo on May 7th, 2015. It will run until July 7th, ending on Cody's birthday. 


 We plan to work on procuring illustrators and cartographers and giving them design plans to work with, as well as finishing the current round of playtests and incorporating the new facets of the game that develop from these over the summer and fall of 2015. 


During the fall and winter of 2015, we will be hoping to ensure the proper write-ups and formatting of the setting, including all the towns and NPCs we've already made, those earned by contributors, some adventure plots, plot hooks, and campaigns that have already been tested (and exist, in note form), as well as developing new aspects of the setting. This, of course, is an ongoing and constant development now, but still has a lot of work to be done. 


During the spring of 2016, we hope to begin the first phases of publication and marketing, and we will be hoping to begin providing our contribution rewards in either spring or early summer of next year, as well.


This is a tight time-frame, but the contributions from this Indiegogo campaign will make it possible to devote a lot of our time and effort to these goals.We hope not to have setbacks, but any setbacks, as well as regular progress updates, will be published on the Facebook and the blogs run by the development team. If you have any questions, comments, encouragement, or any other correspondence to offer, feel free to send an e-mail to our team  at apocalypsedevteam@gmail.com    In Summary The goal of getting Apocalypse developmentally completed and published has been on the hearts and minds of all of Cody's gamer friends since before his untimely passing, and was even discussed at his funeral as a way to give proper homage to our brotherhood and friendship. Hopefully you, too, will be able to contribute to this goal and help us fund this undertaking.If you are unable to contribute in these notably difficult times, the best way you can help is to raise awareness about the project itself. Share the campaign on Facebook and other social media, keep spreading awareness, and even use the awesome sharing tools that Indiegogo has to aid in keeping Apocalypse in the eyes of the gaming community.Tell your friends and family, other gamers, and anyone you think may be interested. Inform them, before it's too late, that the Apocalypse is coming.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The land, where humans and a collective of supernatural species known as ‘Circumspectors’ were selfless and compassionate, perhaps, even friends…</p><p>Together, they were controlled by an assembly of high ranking religious leaders known as ‘Druids’. Druids were notoriously renowned for their peaceful preaching and advice, although, it was rumoured that not all Druids fulfilled their destiny, and were ultimately exiled to a place darker than the fiery pit of hell itself. These few, were known only as ‘the fallen’. They were separated by a ‘living veil’, a filter, setup by the Druid high command, dividing the humans and Circumspectors from the fallen.</p><p>The fallen were vile and debauched. Life on the other side of the veil just further encouraged this ghastly regime with witchcraft and sorcery being practiced daily and was rapidly becoming ungovernable for the ruling Druids. Among all this chaos, there was a hopeful prospect. Archanus, a young son of the most powerful Druid of all. Archanus was a strong, intelligent child. He also had an extraordinary power. Archanus had the ability to foresee impending events, days before they happened. This special power meant Archanus was highly sought after, with the humans, Circumspectors and Druids all fighting for the young prodigy. The fighting was taking an overwhelming effect on him, until it all became too much. The combat drove Archanus insane and his father, under crushing pressure, had no choice but to exile his own son to the other side of the veil, to protect the gift inside his son. The news of Archanus’ exile rang across Earth and the fighting for Archanus’ gift ceased, shortly thereafter.</p><p>The veil controlled the fallen for many centuries, becoming a prison governed by the Druids, sentencing any supernatural creature found guilty of breaking the Druids strict religious rules. The veil was overpopulated and the fallen were rapidly forming a revolution which was vastly assisted by the discovery of Archanus. With no mental capability to defend himself, Archanus was turned to the side of the fallen. For the next four-hundred years, the fallen worked on a spell which allowed the two worlds to combine and the destruction of the veil. This horror was shortly lived.</p><p>That was then. </p><p>This is now. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/761/609/9c2d3ff71ccea0f0a5f592232d9675dc_original.png?v=1431212344&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=ff7d92c21e71ca81adbcbcfa149572e4"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p><p>At its peak, Recurrence was voted as the <b>91st most anticipated</b> indie game!</p><p>Our inspiration for Recurrence was inspired by our collective want to see a truly epic, large-scale, supernatural survival MMO which encompasses realistic survival aspects such as the need for water, food, shelter, protection and transport to name a few.</p><p>Recurrence is <b>huge</b>...

The land, where humans and a collective of supernatural species known as ‘Circumspectors’ were selfless and compassionate, perhaps, even friends…Together, they were controlled by an assembly of high ranking religious leaders known as ‘Druids’. Druids were notoriously renowned for their peaceful preaching and advice, although, it was rumoured that not all Druids fulfilled their destiny, and were ultimately exiled to a place darker than the fiery pit of hell itself. These few, were known only as ‘the fallen’. They were separated by a ‘living veil’, a filter, setup by the Druid high command, dividing the humans and Circumspectors from the fallen.The fallen were vile and debauched. Life on the other side of the veil just further encouraged this ghastly regime with witchcraft and sorcery being practiced daily and was rapidly becoming ungovernable for the ruling Druids. Among all this chaos, there was a hopeful prospect. Archanus, a young son of the most powerful Druid of all. Archanus was a strong, intelligent child. He also had an extraordinary power. Archanus had the ability to foresee impending events, days before they happened. This special power meant Archanus was highly sought after, with the humans, Circumspectors and Druids all fighting for the young prodigy. The fighting was taking an overwhelming effect on him, until it all became too much. The combat drove Archanus insane and his father, under crushing pressure, had no choice but to exile his own son to the other side of the veil, to protect the gift inside his son. The news of Archanus’ exile rang across Earth and the fighting for Archanus’ gift ceased, shortly thereafter.The veil controlled the fallen for many centuries, becoming a prison governed by the Druids, sentencing any supernatural creature found guilty of breaking the Druids strict religious rules. The veil was overpopulated and the fallen were rapidly forming a revolution which was vastly assisted by the discovery of Archanus. With no mental capability to defend himself, Archanus was turned to the side of the fallen. For the next four-hundred years, the fallen worked on a spell which allowed the two worlds to combine and the destruction of the veil. This horror was shortly lived.That was then. This is now.  At its peak, Recurrence was voted as the 91st most anticipated indie game!Our inspiration for Recurrence was inspired by our collective want to see a truly epic, large-scale, supernatural survival MMO which encompasses realistic survival aspects such as the need for water, food, shelter, protection and transport to name a few.Recurrence is huge... Our game is an open world which offers a vast environment which totals out at 386 km squared! That's roughly the distance that the International Space Station is from earth! Rendered in 4K Recurrence boasts high end, realistic looks and feel. With features such as full weather cycles, day & night cycles and lifelike reflections, lighting and water effects that are comparable to current AAA titles. Players have to survive in this boundless world filled with all kinds of supernatural enemies. including demons, vampires, werewolves and many more. Varying methods are required to vanquish different foes, with preparation and planning required to ensure your survival! Players can choose to defend themselves against the array of powerful supernatural enemies or explore the expansive world in order to track and hunt the more powerful enemies in supernatural lore either alone, or as a team. Account System:All player login data is securely created from within PHP client, which is securely sent and stored on a server side SQL database.Networking:Server allocation is random but based on ping and server population with randomized player spawns across the entire map. We utilize Photon Unity Networking as our networking middleware and have ensured that our client server networking is at the highest scalability.We will also implement an in game text chat system to allow players to connect with friends.
Player: Players will be in control of high quality, fully rigged, animated and textured character models. With a wide variety of characters being available for choice along with the choice of both first and third person views in game. 
Audio:  The audio will be important in supporting the realistic feeling of suspension and fear in Recurrence, with detailed environmental sound effects such as footsteps and movement, ambient sound effects, voice overs and a high quality a full soundtrack, Recurrence will sound just as good as it feels to play.Environment: Recurrence is host to a massive world that is currently 386km squared, filled with detailed foliage and architecture that truly brings it to life. Real life physics are present throughout along with a brilliant weather and time cycle.Gameplay:Recurrence is a game that will have you on the edge of your seat. Our game sets a suspense filled atmosphere fueled by a mix of PVP and PVE gameplay, a vast world filled with range of enemies, jump scares and realistic lighting flickers, among many other features.We will include drone's in the game to allow players to plan ahead, use for reconnaissance and ensure they don't walk into a trap. Drones can be customized along with the characters. Characters can be customized by using items that they have crafted in the game or through the purchase/trading of items on the ""black market"" a player driven economy built to sustain the large scale in-game ecosystem.Why Is Recurrence So Special? For us, Recurrence is our pride and joy, with years of planning and over a year of production, there are so many new and innovative features included with Recurrence that evolves the horror-survival genre to a never before seen level. Recurrence also takes on multiple RPG elements and many MMO elements including massively online gameplay, a constantly evolving world, and regular content updates which gives us the ability to learn new skills, explore a never before possible level of production and of course gives us the thrill of creating such a community driven game. Complex and Casual Gameplay: Recurrence aims to target both casual gamers and the more competitive players. Always getting better: Recurrence will never be a ‘finished game’ there will always be something new to enjoy, whether this is a new addition to the world or just a few new vehicles to collect.The Future:Recurrence will be continually updated for as long as possible. We have no intention to ever stop the development of Recurrence. We have many more ambitious and exciting ideas that when the time is right can be transported into the world for you to further enjoy your Recurrence experience. However, for the purpose of keeping the goals realistic we have listed only a few of the game’s core features above.

<p>Hi,  we are an italian company based in Milan and Catania (<a href=""http://www.saturnlab.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SaturnLab</a>), we are developers and graphic designers, and our main dev, Ricardo Antonio Piana, created (almost 12 years ago, and still active!!) <b>Wardrome</b>, a text-based browser game. </p>
<p>Now, we decided to give Wardrome a new life, developing something new, something old (and something blue maybe!), and we need your help.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wardrome 3.0 will be a 3D adventure MMORPG within a galaxy of 400,000 stars that can hold tens of thousands players simultaneously. It will be available in English, Deutsch, Italian, French, Spanish, Portugues and Dutch.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The game will be released in any case (and the perks accomplished) and the goal is to be ready with the open beta by the end of July 2015. <span><br/></span>Some game's scenarios will be simplified in the first period and subsequently fully implemented.</span><br/></p>
<p>It will be played through a browser WebGL compatible and with any mobile device supporting the same technology. Apps will also be developed for the most common devices. Everything will be free to play with the possibility to buy benefits with a coin called ""<b>Gold</b>"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/4631539_1432033758.0067_funddescription.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Players will be able to fight, dig, trade, do missions in space and in the atmosphere, colonize planets, live adventures with their personal character, interact with others.<span><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here is a list of same game scenarios:</span></p>
<p><b>In Space</b><br/>Players aboard their customizable spaceship can:</p>
<p><i>- fight<br/>- trade between planets spaceports for goods needed by other players<span><br/></span></i><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- dig in asteroids or in the solar crowns to find needed materials</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- recover goods scattered in space thanks to tractor beam</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- explore the solar system  jumping from one planet to another in minimal time with the warp jump</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- explore all the galaxy </span>through a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> wormhole system</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- escort missions</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- carry goods and people</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- recovery missions </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- hunting pirates or aliens</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- speed races with other system's commanders</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- treasure hunt with other system's commanders</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/>- missions to clean space orbiting debris</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/>- cooperation with other players in the system to improve the common facilities (capacity and level of spaceport's technology, wormhole generator's efficiency)</span></i></p>
<p><b>Spaceport</b><br/><span>After approaching at a spaceport you will be able to:</span></p>
<p><i>- participate in auctions to get power-ups, weapons, goods, equipment and different spaceships<br/>- rent research laboratories to produce UTEC (research points) to be used for improvements of ships and structures<span><br/></span><span>- hiring crew members based on the available capacity of the ship<span><br/></span><span>- trade goods<span><br/></span><span>- receive missions to accomplish in space, both automated and made up by other players<span><br/></span></span></span></span></i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">- train with other players in combat  in the armory<span><br/></span>- explore the rooms of the spaceport, making espionage missions, investigation, even fighting in Quake style<span><br/></span>- access information of the galactic encyclopedia<span><br/></span>- win upgrades, money, Gold at the spaceport's lottery</i></p>
<p><b>Wormhole generator</b><br/>Allows you to:</p>
<p><i>- Cross the galaxy moving in the branches leading to the neighboring systems in minimal time<br/>- Improve the generator to make it lead systems at a lower cost<span>- Improve the capacity of the generator to reach more distants stars</span></i></p>
<p><b>Planets</b><br/>It will be possible:</p>
<p><i>- Create colonies on the planets, with buildings such as laboratory research, housing, spaceport, planetary defenses etc.<br/>- Land in the colonies of others players to trade<span>- Fighting in atmosphere<span>- Explore with the character  the buildings, make quests, PvP battles.<span>- Races between spacecraft in atmosphere</span></span></span></i></p>
<p>The characters will have their own cash of credits, research points called UTEC, and a special coin game called Gold that you can obtain paying or completing special missions.</p>
<p>The game will be initially implemented by simplifying some of the scenarios described or leaving them on hold and gradually making them 100% working. </p>
<p>The new deployments will be indicated to the players through a history of galaxy evolution.</p>
<p><b>The ships in the first phase of game development will be:</b></p>

<p>Spaceships move, shoot, and defend through the cells of energy that can be charged at fee of credits in spaceports, periodically through a building on planetary colonies, with the sun in space (nearer it is, better it charges)</p>
<p>Players will normally start from neutral faction: attacking a representative of the neutral faction makes hostile all other factions to a certain percentage, attacking another faction makes hostile only that faction. The player of the neutral faction will evolve in the galaxy and will be able to choose one of the factions to belong to after a training period in the game, and then he can change it if it has reached the requirements for a different faction. <span><br/></span>The factions are:</p>
<p><b>- Neutral (red livery) for beginners<br/>- Mining (magenta livery) for players who digged more raw materials<span><br/></span><span>- Traders (green livery) for players who traded more goods<span><br/></span><span>- Military (blue livery) for players who have made more attacks<span><br/></span><span>- ELITE (yellow livery) for players who excels above all factions members. The ELITE faction will have a limited number of players and the last will be expelled  and sent back to neutral based due to the results of a monthly ranking.</span></span></span></b></p>
<p>The Golds allow the following functions:</p>
<p><b>- Purchase of additional lottery tickets at the spaceport (you can win credits, ship upgrades, UTEC, etc. Every day the system assigns one free lottery ticket) 25Gold<br/>- Charging energy of the ship ""on the fly"" in difficult situations (1gold for each cell to recharge)<span>- Immediate construction of buildings in the colonies (depending on the time remaining for the construction)<span>-Bet at an auction before it starts (25 gold)</span></span></b></p>

Hi,  we are an italian company based in Milan and Catania (SaturnLab), we are developers and graphic designers, and our main dev, Ricardo Antonio Piana, created (almost 12 years ago, and still active!!) Wardrome, a text-based browser game. 
Now, we decided to give Wardrome a new life, developing something new, something old (and something blue maybe!), and we need your help.
Wardrome 3.0 will be a 3D adventure MMORPG within a galaxy of 400,000 stars that can hold tens of thousands players simultaneously. It will be available in English, Deutsch, Italian, French, Spanish, Portugues and Dutch.
The game will be released in any case (and the perks accomplished) and the goal is to be ready with the open beta by the end of July 2015. Some game's scenarios will be simplified in the first period and subsequently fully implemented.
It will be played through a browser WebGL compatible and with any mobile device supporting the same technology. Apps will also be developed for the most common devices. Everything will be free to play with the possibility to buy benefits with a coin called ""Gold"".

Players will be able to fight, dig, trade, do missions in space and in the atmosphere, colonize planets, live adventures with their personal character, interact with others.Here is a list of same game scenarios:
In SpacePlayers aboard their customizable spaceship can:
- fight- trade between planets spaceports for goods needed by other players- dig in asteroids or in the solar crowns to find needed materials- recover goods scattered in space thanks to tractor beam- explore the solar system  jumping from one planet to another in minimal time with the warp jump- explore all the galaxy through a wormhole system- escort missions- carry goods and people- recovery missions - hunting pirates or aliens- speed races with other system's commanders- treasure hunt with other system's commanders- missions to clean space orbiting debris- cooperation with other players in the system to improve the common facilities (capacity and level of spaceport's technology, wormhole generator's efficiency)
SpaceportAfter approaching at a spaceport you will be able to:
- participate in auctions to get power-ups, weapons, goods, equipment and different spaceships- rent research laboratories to produce UTEC (research points) to be used for improvements of ships and structures- hiring crew members based on the available capacity of the ship- trade goods- receive missions to accomplish in space, both automated and made up by other players- train with other players in combat  in the armory- explore the rooms of the spaceport, making espionage missions, investigation, even fighting in Quake style- access information of the galactic encyclopedia- win upgrades, money, Gold at the spaceport's lottery
Wormhole generatorAllows you to:
- Cross the galaxy moving in the branches leading to the neighboring systems in minimal time- Improve the generator to make it lead systems at a lower cost- Improve the capacity of the generator to reach more distants stars
PlanetsIt will be possible:
- Create colonies on the planets, with buildings such as laboratory research, housing, spaceport, planetary defenses etc.- Land in the colonies of others players to trade- Fighting in atmosphere- Explore with the character  the buildings, make quests, PvP battles.- Races between spacecraft in atmosphere
The characters will have their own cash of credits, research points called UTEC, and a special coin game called Gold that you can obtain paying or completing special missions.
The game will be initially implemented by simplifying some of the scenarios described or leaving them on hold and gradually making them 100% working. 
The new deployments will be indicated to the players through a history of galaxy evolution.
The ships in the first phase of game development will be:

The Maasym will be the starting ship.

Spaceships move, shoot, and defend through the cells of energy that can be charged at fee of credits in spaceports, periodically through a building on planetary colonies, with the sun in space (nearer it is, better it charges)
Players will normally start from neutral faction: attacking a representative of the neutral faction makes hostile all other factions to a certain percentage, attacking another faction makes hostile only that faction. The player of the neutral faction will evolve in the galaxy and will be able to choose one of the factions to belong to after a training period in the game, and then he can change it if it has reached the requirements for a different faction. The factions are:
- Neutral (red livery) for beginners- Mining (magenta livery) for players who digged more raw materials- Traders (green livery) for players who traded more goods- Military (blue livery) for players who have made more attacks- ELITE (yellow livery) for players who excels above all factions members. The ELITE faction will have a limited number of players and the last will be expelled  and sent back to neutral based due to the results of a monthly ranking.
The Golds allow the following functions:
- Purchase of additional lottery tickets at the spaceport (you can win credits, ship upgrades, UTEC, etc. Every day the system assigns one free lottery ticket) 25Gold- Charging energy of the ship ""on the fly"" in difficult situations (1gold for each cell to recharge)- Immediate construction of buildings in the colonies (depending on the time remaining for the construction)-Bet at an auction before it starts (25 gold)


VERSIONE ITALIANACiao, siamo una società italiana su Milano e Catania (SaturnLab), siamo grafici e sviluppatori, e il nostro ""main dev"", Ricardo Antonio Piana, ha creato (quasi 12 anni fa, ed è ancora attivo!!) Wardrome, un browser game testuale.Abbiamo deciso di dare a Wardrome nuova vita, sviluppando qualcosa di nuovo, qualcosa di vecchio (e magari qualcosa di blu!) e abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto.
Wardrome 3.0 in 3D sarà una avventura MMORPG all’interno di una galassia di 400.000 stelle che potrà ospitare decine di migliaia di giocatori contemporaneamente. Sarà disponibile in Italiano, Inglese, Francese, Tedesco, Spagnolo, Portoghese e Olandese.
Il gioco sarà rilasciato comunque (e i perk consegnati) e l’obiettivo è di essere pronti con la open beta entro la fine di luglio 2015. Alcune parti del gioco saranno semplificate nel primo periodo e implementate successivamente.
Si giocherà attraverso un browser compatibile con le WebGL e con qualsiasi dispositivo mobile che supporti la stessa tecnologia. Saranno anche sviluppate app per i dispositivi più comuni. Tutto sarà free to play con possibilità di acquistare benefit in gioco tramite una moneta chiamata “Gold”.

Il gioco consentirà di combattere, scavare, commerciare, effettuare missioni, sia nello spazio che nell’atmosfera, colonizzare pianeti, creare avventure personali col proprio personaggio, interagire con gli altri. 
Ecco un elenco degli scenari di gioco:
Spazio aperto

Qui a bordo della propria astronave personalizzabile si potrà:- combattere- commerciare tra spazioporti e pianeti i beni necessari  agli altri player- scavare negli asteroidi e nelle corone solari per ottenere i materiali necessari- recuperare merci disperse nello spazio col raggio traente- esplorare il sistema solare di cui si fa parte saltando da un pianeta all’altro in tempi minimi con il salto warp- esplorare la galassia attraverso un sistema di Wormhole- missioni di scorta- missioni di posta- missioni di recupero merci o persone- caccia a pirati o alieni- gare di velocità con altri comandanti del sistema- gare di recupero oggetti con altri comandanti del sistema- missioni di pulizia rifiuti spaziali- cooperazione con gli altri player del sistema per migliorare le strutture comuni (capienza e livello di tecnologia dello spazioporto, efficienza del generatore di Wormhole)SpazioportoUna volta approdati ad uno spazioporto sarà possibile:- partecipare ad aste per ottenere potenziamenti, armi, merci, dispositivi e astronavi differenti- noleggiare laboratori di ricerca per produrre UTEC (punti ricerca) da utilizzare per migliorare navi e strutture.- assumere membri dell’equipaggio in base alla capienza della nave a disposizione.- compravendita di merci all’emporio dello spazioporto.- compravendita di merci contrattando con altri personaggi nei locali comuni dello spazioporto.- andare al bar dello spazioporto per ricevere missioni da compiere nello spazio, sia automatizzate che inventate da altri giocatori.- allenarsi con altri giocatori nel combattimento con laser e corpo a corpo nella sala d’armi.- esplorare le sale dello spazioporto, compiendo missioni di spionaggio, investigazione, anche con combattimenti in stile Quake.- accedere alle informazioni dell’enciclopedia galattica.- vincere potenziamenti, denaro, Gold alla lotteria dello spazioporto.Generatore di WormholePermetterà di:
- attraversare la galassia passando nei rami che conducono ai sistemi vicini in tempi minimi- migliorare il generatore in modo che conduca nei sistemi a costi minori- migliorare la portata del generatore PianetiSarà possibile:
- creare colonie sui pianeti, con costruzioni quali laboratorio di ricerca, alloggi, spazioporto di terra, difese planetarie etc.- atterrare in colonie altrui per scambi commerciali- combattimenti in atmosfera- esplorazione col personaggio degli edifici, missioni, combattimenti pvp.- gare tra astronavi in atmosferaI personaggi avranno una propria cassa divisa in crediti, punti ricerca chiamati UTEC, e una moneta speciale di gioco chiamata Gold che sarà possibile ottenere con acquisto in-app o svolgendo missioni particolari.
Il gioco verrà implementato inizialmente semplificando alcuni degli scenari descritti o lasciandoli in sospeso e via via rendendoli completi al 100%. Le nuove implementazioni verranno segnalate ai giocatori attraverso una storia della galassia in evoluzione.Le astronavi della prima fase di sviluppo in gioco saranno le seguenti:La Maasym sarà la nave iniziale.Le astronavi si spostano, sparano e difendono grazie a delle celle di energia che possono essere ricaricate mediante crediti negli spazioporti, periodicamente tramite un edificio sulle colonie planetarie o col sole nello spazio (più è vicino e più veloce è il caricamento).I giocatori iniziano normalmente dalla fazione neutrale: attaccare un rappresentante della fazione neutrale inimica tutte le altre fazioni di una certa percentuale, attaccare una fazione inimica solo quella fazione. Il giocatore della fazione neutrale potrà a seconda del suo operato nella galassia, scegliere una delle fazioni a cui appartenere dopo un certo periodo di training in gioco e successivamente cambiarla se ha raggiunto i requisiti per una fazione diversa. Le fazioni sono:- neutrale (livrea rossa) per i principianti- mineraria (livrea magenta) per i giocatori che hanno -scavato più materie prime- commerciale (livrea verde) per i giocatori che hanno scambiato più merci- militare (livrea blu) per i giocatori che hanno compiuto più attacchi- ELITE (livrea gialla) per i giocatori che si sono elevati sopra tutte le fazioni precedenti eccellendo in tutto. La fazione ELITE avrà un numero limitato di giocatori e gli ultimi verranno espulsi e retrocessi alla neutrale in base ai risultati di una classifica mensile.I Gold consentiranno le seguenti funzioni:- acquisto di biglietti addizionali della lotteria presso lo spazioporto (si possono vincere crediti, potenziamenti navali, UTEC, etc. Ogni giorno il sistema ne assegna uno gratuitamente ( 25gold)- ricarica dell’energia della nave “al volo” in situazioni difficili, (1gold per ogni cella da ricaricare)- costruzione immediata di edifici nelle colonie (dipendente dal tempo restante per la costruzione)- offerta ad un asta prima che inizi (25 gold)",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> You have arrived too late. The attack has already wiped out every human on earth. Now it's up to you and your team to rebuild civilization. Explore and survive on an empty planet with your team. Build shelter, scavenge the city, climb mountains, the possibilities are endless. Do whatever you want in this post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>The Ground Division aims to give a realistic and enjoyable survival experience that can be shared with friends in the Co-op mode, or you can test your skills alone in the wilderness and be the sole survivor of the attack if you choose. Combining photo-realistic graphics, complex and immersive gameplay systems, and support for various VR platforms we can achieve the most realistic and immersive survival experience yet. While these systems are complex and immersive, we have made them as user friendly as possible so just about anyone can be fully immersed in The Ground Division without worry of complex systems and interfaces.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding mainly to expand our team to include Environment Artists, Networking Programmers, Gameplay Programmers and hopefully more developers to make this project great. Currently, the project is under development by a single dev, but with your support and funding we can hire more devs onto the team to help speed up development.</p>
<p>What's in it for you? We want to get the community as involved with the development of this project as possible, that's why we are giving all our backers immediate access to early alpha test at the conclusion of this campaign so we can get your reactions and feedback as early on in development as possible. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to get additional perks such as naming buildings in-game and digital wallpapers and the soundtrack to the game depending on what perks you select.</p>
<p>What if we don't reach our funding goal? This project is important to us and we will make sure to do as much with whatever we get to continue to make this project great and get it into your hands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your support, we can make this project not only a reality, but we can make this great and make this the game we have all been waiting for.</p>
<p>We have all been waiting for the perfect open-world survival game, while I can't guarantee this will be perfect, we will put the work in and make it as close to perfect as we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As you may have seen before with projects of this scale in early development, there is a very real possibility of failure. However, we are confident in our ability and believe we have demonstrated our dedication and skill to this project to make The Ground Division a reality. With your support, we are certain we can finish this project and get it into your hands.</p>
<p>To maintain your trust and support, we have decided to give the community a larger role in development than most projects like this. We are doing this by making the early alpha builds of the project available to supporters at the end of this campaign for immediate reactions and feedback so we can continue to build a game that you, the community, want to play. Not only that, but we will also continue to put out monthly development vlogs showing off the current development progress.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will never delete comments or silence the voices of our community. The core of this project is community-driven and we never want to take that away from you. Not only do we want to use these platforms to communicate updates on development, but most importantly we want to be sure your voice is always heard.</p>

The rumor is, a kid named  Charles got lost in it, went in and never came out. When a cop went in  after them they went missing as well. No one’s entirely sure, but the  locals tend to keep away from it claiming it to be a curse upon the land. The maze lives right on the edge of the Local Fairgrounds, and this year, they are hoping to open it up as an attraction.</p><p>Built on the land of Ethel Fir, a twice widowed woman who died in 1935 leaving no will and no heir. It's said the maze was a  crazed project she had worked away at for years before her death. She had fervently planted and shaped the trees muttering about looky loos and nosey brats as it grew bigger each year, surrounding her house and  grounds, and slowly growing taller and taller. After nearly 8 years without anyone seeing her, the local authorities assumed her dead, and  entered the maze. They found her home in a state of disrepair, food  clearly long rotten, and it appeared no one had lived in it for quite a  long time. They searched the home, and what they could of the maze  itself, but failed to find her body or any information regarding her  death. Without a will in place, her property was left to the state, and  turned into a local park, open to the fair when it visited town. It's  said that from time to time kids will wander in on a dare, or couples  will enter trying to find old Ethel's home as a quiet place to be together. Often they come out safe and sound, if a little excitable, but the town has always had a higher than normal rate of missing persons. No one has ever been found in the maze. In the light of day it's simply an overgrown hedge, and a dilapidated home from the late 1800s.

The screenshots have been taken over the course of a few months of development so some more look different to others. It may or may not change and the game may look graphically different as development continues.What is Labyrinthine?Labyrinthine is a horror game that can be played solo or co-operatively online that may just make you never want to enter a hedge maze again. As you navigate the dark corridors, you will be faced with puzzles, scares and Horrifying monsters with unique AI's designed to hunt you down.Together with up to 4 players online (or even alone if you're feeling brave!) you must solve the mystery of the happisburg hedge maze while escaping the clutches of the denizens within.As multiplayer fans and horror fanatics, we noticed a bitter lack of cooperative horror titles out there. Being fairly well versed in the market, it appears that a lot of the games that do allow for cooperative horror are gimicky and lack any real depth/immersion. Many are seemingly from indie studios that don't really focus on producing a creepy atmosphere and focus more on cheap jumpscares. We want to change that. We have made it our goal to build a worthy title to appease those longing for something new and exciting.Labyrinthine is our answer to a severely lacking genre and we have done extensive research and learning into what makes people feel uneasy, scared and downright terrified. There's an emphasis on the emotion of terror over horror (see Horror vs Terror) as we feel it creates a more memorable fear. Teamplay is encouraged as we have built the game from the ground up as a co-op centric game.Before We Continue, Make Sure To Visit These Links:Joining our discord is a great way to watch development and interract with the developers directly. We post updates, answer questions and take suggestions. We would really appreciate you joining us, even if you mute the server and only check it now and then!Make sure to wishlist us on steam! It costs you nothing, is only a single click and helps us out massively. Steam recommends unreleased games based on their wishlist count so every one matters!  Gameplay within Labyrinthine can be broken down into several smaller gameplay loops.SearchingAt certain sections of the game, you will be tasked with finding items to progress. This will involve good navigation skills as the item spawnpoints will often be randomised and the hedges can disorientate you. Having an organised party will help make these sections much easier to handle!PuzzlesPuzzles play a large role in the game. You will be presented with various puzzles that hinder progress until completed. Don't worry if you're not a fantastic puzzle solver, while some will test your perception, none of them are too difficult to decipher for the average person. Again, teamplay is promoted as more minds on the puzzle will solve it quicker.FleeingYou are not alone in the maze. Various monstrosities are active within it's walls and they aren't going to take your presence positively. You will have to run, hide and use other tactics to escape from the horrors that pursue you.Teamwork As mentioned, our game has been built from the ground up with teamplay in mind. We want to promote teamplay as much as possible while still maintaining a solo-available experience. You will have access to items that help teams organise themselves and find each other. These include Glowsticks, a Compass and more.Story / LorefindingLabyrinthine has a full set of lore built behind the scenes that explains the who, what, why when and where. We aim to make this discoverable by piecing together various bits of in-game lore. From audio tapes to notes; The story hunter can find the truth behind the happisburg hedge maze!  The environment in Labyrinthine is key to creating a truly unnerving atmosphere. We have put a lot of effort into creating an atmospheric darkness which leaves you feeling disconnected and subdued. To keep everything feeling flush and immersive, nearly all of our major assets are created in-house. You may be surprised to hear that the environment in Labyrinthine isn't all just hedges either! We realise that too much of the same thing is unstimulating, so we have worked hard on changing things up within the maze. You will have the chance to visit various environments within the confines of the maze, including indoor locations, underground and a forest...Environment scares will also play a large part in-game.

they flirt with one another all the time to express their interest. Not only is
this natural, but it is fun &amp; it is what attracts you to that person in the
first few moments.  Welcome to flirtStack,

</div></div>","About the Project








flirtStack is about ‘hitting on’ someone, and most of the
time someone not of your choice!


‘Flirting is FUN! 
And we all know flirting takes place in almost every situation… between
friends, co-workers, or even total strangers. 
Many times it’s the mechanism that increases the bond between two people.  For instance, when two people start dating
they flirt with one another all the time to express their interest. Not only is
this natural, but it is fun & it is what attracts you to that person in the
first few moments.  Welcome to flirtStack,
an adult card game for 4-12 people that brings everyone together for fun,
laughter & excitement!  


flirtStack is a combination of social networking and
traditional card games - all wrapped up in a single package!




This game was
designed (to cater to both techno geeks and old fashioned card/and/or
board-gamers) because we felt the need to increase social activity without total
loss of mobile interaction!  The social
aspect is still there, & so is the technology interface, and besides that,
a social network specifically designed for flirters!  The QR code below takes you directly to flirtStack Home, so why wait!  SCAN the code, SIGN UP & START FLIRTING today!   





flirtStack is all about taking a chance!
If your
choice is to play the extended social network interface version (Mobile Net
Version), thereby incorporating the internet extension, your mobile phone
becomes an important part of the game as there are rules in the game that allow
for you to follow a QR coded link to the flirtStack website where you will  'Take a Chance' & ‘Roll the Dice”!  This game is made to be played anywhere where
you may or may not have mobile reception. However, where you do have mobile
reception, do play the extended social network interface version, as it adds an
added dimension of fun and laughter!











flirtStack is all about selfies - groupie & individual! 
flirtStack.com not only allows an added
dimension where flirters are in accordance to the rules able to “Roll the Dice”

flirters all over the world to unite, and to ‘Flirt’ of course!

</div></div>","Hang on to your stuff and get ready for Cops and Thugs.. at Night! Our first Videogame for mobile devices. 
Navigate your way as a thief and steal as much stuff in the dark. Whatever you do mind the walls, furniture and especially the cops. There's more than 100 various stages all set to test your memory and dexterity. Are you the king of thieves?












Cops & Thugs.. At night! Is the first release by HiveStudio.
Born in beautiful Barcelona we are two associates with more than 8 years experience working abroad in different places such as Spain, France, USA and Canada as Computer Science Engineers specialized in Mobile Development since 2010. 
We are passionate about videogames since childhood. Since we started working on Mobile Apps we wanted to work on a videogame someday.
Finally we came up with this idea of gameplay two years ago and we started working since then in our spare time. Now we believe it’s time to give it a final push as we strive to create a professional videogame that everyone can enjoy.
Albert Castro
I really love Canada but I have to say it gets quite cold during the winter, but hey! Being stuck at home for 6 months a year also means you have plenty of time to dedicate to indoors hobbies, such as programming. I loved working on this project. I learnt a lot about videogame development as well as level design and even working on the graphics.
Damia Ferrer
I’m luckier than Albert so I can see the sunshine everyday in hot California. I’m passionate about robotics as well as mobile programming. Working in this game it’s been inspiring as I have been able to learn a lot about game level design, programming, etc.
Saoud Belshalat
I have been a gamer for as long as i can remember. I come from one of the most successful cities in the world, Dubai. I am passionate about being successful in anything I do. I work in a telecommunication company, I am the founder and board member of the UAE rugby federation. Surprisingly, I still have so much spare time. My role here is to help promote this amazing game with Albert and Damia through marketing, and also to introduce a new addictive, yet fun, game to the world.We need your help in order to polish the game up and create the best user experience. We want to take it to the next level and make the game as fun as possible!Apart from the funds we may receive, we really like the idea of having other people participating in our game. That's why our rewards are focused on adding game content created by our indiegogo backers. We are sure people will have much more ideas of new levels and power up items! We look forward to hear your feedback!

We are asking for $5,000. Most of the game engine and graphics are already done. So we need the money to finish the game and to add content to make it funnier!! The budged will be distributed like this:

$5,000: Create levels. Our goal is to have at least 100 levels. The more time you can play the more time you enjoy!
$3,000: More power up items! We want to make the game as varied as possible. We don’t like repetitive videogames!
$1,000: Enhance user experience. We would like to create Leaderboards and Achievements to challenge the player!
$1,000: Add miscellaneous content.

In case we could get more funds, we would like to expand the game to other devices and add much more content to the game:
$20,000: Game+ version. We love playing difficult games! We want to add a new Game+ to enlarge game life.
$24,000: iPad version. Imagine play a huge level on your tablet, we would love to create this version!
$30,000: Android version. As we have limited resources we can only work on the IOS version right now, but we would be glad to create a version for all the Android players out there.

Our release day for the App Store is scheduled for April 1st, 2015! Once we achieve our funding goal we will be working on the indiegogo features adding content to the game!
In case we may succeed on our funding goal the idea is to launch an iPad and Android version during Summer 2015.

<p>We've launched a new referral program, check out the Updates section to read more about it <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/suuri-s-adventure-game/x/11006067#/updates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/suuri-s-adve...</a></p><p>Suuri's Adventure is a mixed genre game that uses both a
matching and adventure based themes. Suuri takes off on her adventure to save
her brother with 5 weapons. Each stone in the matching portion of the game
corresponds to one of the 5 elemental weapons, matching 3 or more of those
stones charges that weapon. Here is a prototype, game board and stones are
final but the character art and weapons are placement only.<br/>

The following is my basic GDD to give more info about the game.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Suuri’s Adventure</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>High Concept:</strong><br/>
The high queen Suuri Kuningatar returns home from a long journey to find that
her brother has been kidnapped by Lady Elle Mantle the lady of darkness in an
attempt to gain control of the master crystal. Suuri gathers her wits and
weapons to set out into the realm, fighting Elle’s bosses and minions to rescue
her brother. She will need skill and cunning to overcome the waves of evil
bosses and minions to reach the heart of Elle’s realm.<br/>
<br/>
Suuri’s Adventure is the first title in a series of different games planned.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Backstory:</strong><br/>
In the benevolent land of Criostail Ghleann lives a crystal people charged with
keeping the balance of energy here on Earth. Deep in the center of this land
lies Magtcentrum the seat of power, a place where the 12 crystal leaders
(Emerald, Amethist, Agate, Aquamarine, Citrine, Celestite, Garnet, Jade, Lapis,
Malachite, Rose Quartz, and Ruby) gather to absorb the ethereal energy and
regulate its power down to the earthly plane. Suuri Kuningatar, the Emerald
high queen of the land, watches over everything with a justful and kind eye.
They have thrived in peacefull abundance under her rule for thousands of years.
There has been only one citizen in the recent history of Criostail Ghleann
who’s greedy and ambitious nature caused her to be cast out of the land. The
Onyx lady of darkness Elle Mantle, whose lust for power has grown exponentially
over the centuries and she will stop at nothing to control the master crystal
underneath Magtcentrum. Recruiting elements from the lower realms she has
finally amassed an army that might be large enough to become such a threat.
Once Elle controls the master crystal she will use block the flow of energy to
earth, keeping it for herself and raising her to godlike ability. It is up to
Suuri Kuningatar and the other 11 crystal leaders to stop Elle from succeeding.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Game Platform:</strong><br/>
The game is a mix of genres, a match 3+ with an adventure. It is intended to be
a social media game (Facebook). The game will use a free to play / in-game
purchase model. Special ability stones will be available as random drops and in
the game store. The game will use Unicoins as a common currency, which will
also be used in future titles.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Game Play:</strong><br/>
The player swaps adjacent (vertical / horizontal) symbols, no match will be
required to move a symbol. Successfully matching 3 or more symbols will charge
that symbol’s weapon in the adventure part. As the symbols match they remove
themselves and drop down new symbols, there is a possibility for multiple
symbol types to match up. Example, if one of the dropping symbols completes a
match those will also be counted in that turn. There will be 5 different symbols
1 for each element, Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Psi (psychic/spirit) used to
charge the 5 weapons Suuri caries. Two regular game stones will also be used. A
life stone that will act as a heal stone, giving the player a health boost. The
second is a death stone, this one will take half the match points for that
stone away from the total enemy health and give it to the player.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Game Play Mechanics:</strong><br/>
<strong>Game Layout:</strong><br/>
There will be a few screen types from main title to social media specific and
the main game screen .The main game screen will be split into 2 sections, the
lower half will consist of the matching part while the adventure portion will
be on top.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Mechanics:</strong><br/>
There will be starting levels based on each element and some other levels to be
added later. Example might be seasonal types (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine’s
Day, etc.). Each set will have 3 levels per element with increasing number of
waves per level. The first will be 3 enemy waves then 4 then 5. Additional sets
added later can be variable from 3 - 5 levels per set. The player advances to
the next wave by matching symbols in the lower grid to charge the weapon in the
adventure part to shoot the enemies on screen. With each successful match of 3
or more like symbols it charges the appropriate elemental weapon and shoots at
the enemies in the upper adventure half decreasing its health bar. It is a turn
based game so after the player fires each enemy on screen will take turns
shooting at the player. The weapons are upgradable to add stamina and damage for
that weapon. Player health is a base number plus the stamina of all the
weapons.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Player Control:</strong><br/>
The player will use the mouse (or touch/drag for mobile devices) to move
adjacent pieces on the match 3 game grid.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Score &amp; Health Meters:</strong><br/>
Each enemy will have a health bar that will decrease as the enemy is hit. The
player will also have a main health bar that will decrease with each enemy hit.
Each enemy defeated will add to the score.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Winning &amp; Losing:</strong><br/>
Winning solution is two parts, first successfully defeating all enemies on
screen per “wave” and finally defeating the “boss” wave to complete each level.
Score points will be added to the main score which will advance the player with
experience points. Those points are used to upgrade the weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Loss condition is if the player loses all heath before defeating the “boss”.
Score points will be lost.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Game Environment:</strong><br/>
The game environment will be split into two sections. The upper part will have
an adventure section displaying the world, enemies, and elemental weapons. Each
level set will keep a common theme, example the water element will have a water
look and feel to it. The lower part will have the match 3 game grid. A
background will be used to fill the negative space and tie the theme together
for that level set.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Characters:</strong><br/>
<strong>The Player’s Character:</strong><br/>
The player is the title character (protagonist) Suuri Kuningatar.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The NPCs:</strong><br/>
Elle Mantle, the main antagonist. Each wave will have a boss and several minion
types for that level set theme.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Why indiegogo:</strong><br/>
The basic game prototype has been made but your help is needed to complete the
graphics and character art needed for the 30 initial levels.<br/>
<br/>
A boss character will be created for the highest supporter over $10,000 for a
special supporter’s level. In the event of more than one with the same amount a
random drawing will be held to pick who will become the Boss for that level.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>BIO</strong><br/>
currently a design studio for a variety of medium from print to web and offer
services including design, programming and photography. The goal is to
transition into a full gaming studio. Initially creating games for social media
and expand into full desktop and mobile titles within the first 2 to 3 years.
This title is the first in a series around Suuri. A prototype is made; however,
funds are needed to generate the artwork for all the characters, backgrounds,
and weapons in the game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Stretch goals:</strong><br/>
$65,000<br/>
Experience points are universal but an option can be added later to allow
special “drops” from the enemies allowing for element specific upgrades and
special abilities for the weapons.<br/>
<br/>
$80,000<br/>
Currently the damage is calculated based on the weapon numbers; however, this
can be augmented by adding a player stat option that can have shield, health,
and damage ratings that up those numbers and help protect the character better.<br/>
<br/>

</div>","We've launched a new referral program, check out the Updates section to read more about it https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/suuri-s-adve...Suuri's Adventure is a mixed genre game that uses both a
matching and adventure based themes. Suuri takes off on her adventure to save
her brother with 5 weapons. Each stone in the matching portion of the game
corresponds to one of the 5 elemental weapons, matching 3 or more of those
stones charges that weapon. Here is a prototype, game board and stones are
final but the character art and weapons are placement only.

Main game screen
The following is my basic GDD to give more info about the game.

Suuri’s Adventure

High Concept:
The high queen Suuri Kuningatar returns home from a long journey to find that
her brother has been kidnapped by Lady Elle Mantle the lady of darkness in an
attempt to gain control of the master crystal. Suuri gathers her wits and
weapons to set out into the realm, fighting Elle’s bosses and minions to rescue
her brother. She will need skill and cunning to overcome the waves of evil
bosses and minions to reach the heart of Elle’s realm.

Suuri’s Adventure is the first title in a series of different games planned.

Backstory:
In the benevolent land of Criostail Ghleann lives a crystal people charged with
keeping the balance of energy here on Earth. Deep in the center of this land
lies Magtcentrum the seat of power, a place where the 12 crystal leaders
(Emerald, Amethist, Agate, Aquamarine, Citrine, Celestite, Garnet, Jade, Lapis,
Malachite, Rose Quartz, and Ruby) gather to absorb the ethereal energy and
regulate its power down to the earthly plane. Suuri Kuningatar, the Emerald
high queen of the land, watches over everything with a justful and kind eye.
They have thrived in peacefull abundance under her rule for thousands of years.
There has been only one citizen in the recent history of Criostail Ghleann
who’s greedy and ambitious nature caused her to be cast out of the land. The
Onyx lady of darkness Elle Mantle, whose lust for power has grown exponentially
over the centuries and she will stop at nothing to control the master crystal
underneath Magtcentrum. Recruiting elements from the lower realms she has
finally amassed an army that might be large enough to become such a threat.
Once Elle controls the master crystal she will use block the flow of energy to
earth, keeping it for herself and raising her to godlike ability. It is up to
Suuri Kuningatar and the other 11 crystal leaders to stop Elle from succeeding.

Game Platform:
The game is a mix of genres, a match 3+ with an adventure. It is intended to be
a social media game (Facebook). The game will use a free to play / in-game
purchase model. Special ability stones will be available as random drops and in
the game store. The game will use Unicoins as a common currency, which will
also be used in future titles.

Game Play:
The player swaps adjacent (vertical / horizontal) symbols, no match will be
required to move a symbol. Successfully matching 3 or more symbols will charge
that symbol’s weapon in the adventure part. As the symbols match they remove
themselves and drop down new symbols, there is a possibility for multiple
symbol types to match up. Example, if one of the dropping symbols completes a
match those will also be counted in that turn. There will be 5 different symbols
1 for each element, Earth, Air, Fire, Water and Psi (psychic/spirit) used to
charge the 5 weapons Suuri caries. Two regular game stones will also be used. A
life stone that will act as a heal stone, giving the player a health boost. The
second is a death stone, this one will take half the match points for that
stone away from the total enemy health and give it to the player.

Game Play Mechanics:
Game Layout:
There will be a few screen types from main title to social media specific and
the main game screen .The main game screen will be split into 2 sections, the
lower half will consist of the matching part while the adventure portion will
be on top.

Mechanics:
There will be starting levels based on each element and some other levels to be
added later. Example might be seasonal types (Halloween, Christmas, Valentine’s
Day, etc.). Each set will have 3 levels per element with increasing number of
waves per level. The first will be 3 enemy waves then 4 then 5. Additional sets
added later can be variable from 3 - 5 levels per set. The player advances to
the next wave by matching symbols in the lower grid to charge the weapon in the
adventure part to shoot the enemies on screen. With each successful match of 3
or more like symbols it charges the appropriate elemental weapon and shoots at
the enemies in the upper adventure half decreasing its health bar. It is a turn
based game so after the player fires each enemy on screen will take turns
shooting at the player. The weapons are upgradable to add stamina and damage for
that weapon. Player health is a base number plus the stamina of all the
weapons.

Player Control:
The player will use the mouse (or touch/drag for mobile devices) to move
adjacent pieces on the match 3 game grid.

Score & Health Meters:
Each enemy will have a health bar that will decrease as the enemy is hit. The
player will also have a main health bar that will decrease with each enemy hit.
Each enemy defeated will add to the score.

Winning & Losing:
Winning solution is two parts, first successfully defeating all enemies on
screen per “wave” and finally defeating the “boss” wave to complete each level.
Score points will be added to the main score which will advance the player with
experience points. Those points are used to upgrade the weapons.

Loss condition is if the player loses all heath before defeating the “boss”.
Score points will be lost.

Game Environment:
The game environment will be split into two sections. The upper part will have
an adventure section displaying the world, enemies, and elemental weapons. Each
level set will keep a common theme, example the water element will have a water
look and feel to it. The lower part will have the match 3 game grid. A
background will be used to fill the negative space and tie the theme together
for that level set.

Characters:
The Player’s Character:
The player is the title character (protagonist) Suuri Kuningatar.

The NPCs:
Elle Mantle, the main antagonist. Each wave will have a boss and several minion
types for that level set theme.

Why indiegogo:
The basic game prototype has been made but your help is needed to complete the
graphics and character art needed for the 30 initial levels.

A boss character will be created for the highest supporter over $10,000 for a
special supporter’s level. In the event of more than one with the same amount a
random drawing will be held to pick who will become the Boss for that level.

BIO
currently a design studio for a variety of medium from print to web and offer
services including design, programming and photography. The goal is to
transition into a full gaming studio. Initially creating games for social media
and expand into full desktop and mobile titles within the first 2 to 3 years.
This title is the first in a series around Suuri. A prototype is made; however,
funds are needed to generate the artwork for all the characters, backgrounds,
and weapons in the game.



Stretch goals:
$65,000
Experience points are universal but an option can be added later to allow
special “drops” from the enemies allowing for element specific upgrades and
special abilities for the weapons.

$80,000
Currently the damage is calculated based on the weapon numbers; however, this
can be augmented by adding a player stat option that can have shield, health,
and damage ratings that up those numbers and help protect the character better.

$100,000
Currently the game is designed for desktop social media platforms using Flash,
with extra support we will port the game to a mobile friendly game engine.

<h3>About Elemental Perios &amp; Its Team </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559710369/igdjponra67mco47wnfj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hi, we're the Elemental Perios team. We're led by Stuart Miller, a father who was fascinated by the amount of useless information his children retained about video game characters in their brains. He asked himself, ""What if there was a video game that was just as fun, but actually taught children something worthwhile?"" </p>
<p>Enter the magical world of Perios. In this world, a Perio is a character much like a Pokemon™ and there are many different types -- 118 to be exact. That's because each Perio stands for a different element of the Periodic Table of Elements. Every unique Perio comes with unique characteristics, mirroring those of actual chemical elements. The more a child learns about their favorite Perio, the more they learn about chemistry. </p>
<p>Since Stuart first wondered how his kids could better use their brains, the Perios team developed three apps and mobile games and launched Perios themed interactive learning exhibits at Utica Children's Museum. </p>
<p><strong>Now, his children are all grown up and the Perios world is growing up too. </strong></p>
<p>We hope to raise $50,000 to fund the rest of the development of the newest and most ambitious Perios game yet: Elemental Perios. This multi-level quest game will remind children of Halo and Pokemon combined. As the Elemental Explorer (the main character) discovers this new and beautiful universe, it can catch Perios, utilize their unique characteristics, or combine them with others to create useful reactions.</p>
<p>Instead of storing useless facts about made up characters, players will gain a foundational knowledge of chemistry that they can bring with them to their first high school chemistry class. The trick is making the game so fun, they don't even realize it's educational. We like to call this phenomenon ""accidental learning""<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span></p>
<p><font>To bring the game to life, Stuart Miller teamed up with Forge Modern, a creative technology consulting firm in Los Angeles led by Elias Clark. Clark is Forge Modern's </font>Creative Developer with a Masters in Animation and New Media and a passion for developing engaging educational experiences. <font>So far, </font>Forge Modern's team has done an incredible job building out the first level of the game.</p>

Whatever funds we raise will be used 100% towards marketing and materials for our game.  Our perks - We will give you a link to come hang out with us and chat live and view us actually coding and playing the game. We are all super friendly and from 3 different countries. Our campaign is important to us and for the people who love VR games and want more of them. We are making a difference as we give some of our revenues to charities such as the Happy Housing which helps to fight the homelessness in Canada.We worked on some of these games that were very successful and can be seen at rikkir.com & happyhousing.orgWe are now trying to make a game that is going to get attention for being unique and bring the joy of narrative-driven games to VR. This is our first VR game, but we feel that our experience in game making lead us to this and gave us the edge we needed.We are actively playtesting other VR games to make sure we get our game just right, and are getting people to sign up and become alpha testers to help us find bugs and suggest features. Some people can't afford to contribute at this point, but that doesn't mean they can't help:If you can not contribute any money then feel free to share this campaign on your social media pages or any other website you feel people might be interested on.Come join us on our Discord channel to discuss development, propose ideas or to just hangout with us! www.discord.me/rikkirgames",12.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Battle &amp; Combat</b><br/></p>
<p><i>Mini Melee</i> is a hack and slash action MMORPG. <br/></p>
<p>With the availability to move in 8 direction, it allows the player to attack in any direction within 360 degrees giving the 3D effect in a 2.5D environment.</p>
<p>Due to Weapons are all i short range, it requires the player to hone their skills in dodging, reacting, predicting and attacking precisely w<span style=""background-color: initial;"">hich is the game's goal, to offer a complete player-performance game.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Game Engine</b></p>
<p><i>Mini Melee</i> is currently being developed using Unity3D Engine.</p>
<p>It's globally known for developing high-end games both in 2D or 3D.</p>
<p>It is also one of the Top 5 Game Engines that is purely dedicated on developing games that is user and developer friendly.</p>
<p>With the use of Unity3D Engine, it will allow us to develop and publish our games in cross-platforms like Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Community</b></p>
<p><i>Mini Melee</i>'s community will be a place where we will provide 24/7 player support and moderation with a less than an hour response in-game or not.</p>
<p>Players, Veterans and Game Masters (Moderators, Developers and Leaders) will coexist in the game to assure safe and secured gaming experience.</p>
<p>Meaning, players can regularly see and chat with available Game Masters online in the game and ultimately play with them on events, hunts and raids.</p>
<p>However, Game Masters aren't allowed to trade players and be included in a trade between players. Both players are only liable for their gains/losses. Game Masters will never ask/give/return items.</p>
<p>Observed dedicated player applicants may be promoted to a Game Veteran and become a part of the Player Support Team to provide a better in-game/forum assistance for other players.</p>
<p>Game Veterans are still players, meaning they can still trade with other players, but they have additional in-game powers for player assistance. For example, they can fly in every floor and in any location like Game Masters can.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if Game Veterans are observed as completely dedicated on their activity and performance, they may be promoted as an Official Game Master not only in Mini Melee but also in all game projects of The Exceeds.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Budget</p>
<p><i>Mini Melee</i>'s budget include salaries, rents, utilities, equipment, legal costs and other sort of business activities that will require financial support ahead.</p>
<p><i style=""background-color: initial;"">The Exceeds</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> team have decided to set the $10,000 as a minimum starting line to continue the development. With the continuous support and contribution of people in the IndieGoGo community, we'll be able to expand our team and be able to fasten our development while increasing and delivering decent results and updates to our user which will serve as our stretch goal.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If you have noticed, $10,000 is very low to support the development funds and would actually support only a single developer in a month considering the scale of this game project. Some of us have been using our own pockets already just to keep the development running because we really wanted to make this game project possible and hopefully release a Single-Player prototype demo of the game to give the users a feel of the game.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>The Team</b></p>
<p><i>The Exceeds </i>Team is composed of members who have been in the gaming industry for many years, if not, decades. All of them were originally players before and they're able to pinpoint what's good and bad about a game from its basic to complex features within a user's perspective which comes from their experience to be applied in the development.</p>
<p><i>Mini Melee</i> is a big game project and certainly we would need to expand our team by adding more talented developers especially artists and designers suitable for the nature of Mini Melee which we can't make it possible without your support.</p>

This way, from a user's perspective, we can both easily pinpoint what are good and bad points that can be enhanced and simplified for a better straightforward in-game systems that can be fully enjoyed by the users. Ultimately, we may also pick Game Veterans within the IndieGoGo community when they're fully interested and suitable for the development of Mini Melee. Check the Community topic below for more details about Game Veterans.Note: Majority of the Concept Art below is a rough sketch and temporary. It will be replaced later on with better graphical presentation from the development updates. The GameMini Melee is a 2.5D Action MMORPG wherein users can experience the 2D and 3D essence of a game altogether while delivering user-friendly gaming experience. Each set of system that will be built in the game will have an important impact on the user's experience and game play rather than just ""another feature"" to be added. The Exceeds team is sensitively designing in-game systems to be added to bring a full relevance of each in the game.World ExplorationMini Melee is played in a 2.5D isometric environment with 8 directional controls using WASD keys as movement controls.Mini Melee's world is greatly influenced and designed by a combination of Greek & Roman Mythology and the essence of some anime shows and games blended to bring a whole new user experience in a virtual world.The World of Mini Melee is set in a massive ever-changing clocktower called the Tower of Eternity or also known as Horologium. It is divided into floors sustained by the Guardians and the Crystals at the center of each floor. Who knows what lies ahead beyond the horizon.Players must fulfill the Current Floor Guardian's Wish  to obtain a Crystal Badge that will serve as a Key to the Gate of the Next Floor.World exploration is both in an open world manner wherein all players within the vicinity can hunt on the same monsters/bosses and in an instanced manner wherein players can either enter an area in solo mode (1), party mode (5) or raid mode (10-20).
Character Progression
Mini Melee's progression system is synchronously designed as level is dictated by the highest quality of gears crafted and worn. Meaning, there won't be an experience system.

For example, Player A has successfully crafted full Golden-tier set from the Nth Floor. Player A's level is as well successfully leveled up to XX. It's a matter of grinding materials for better gears to level up than experience gained.
In short, if your Level is high it exactly means you're that well geared altogether. This way, the problem within most MMORPGs as high leveled players with poor gear ratings for dungeons & raids is solved. While the rest will be player performance based.



Player Stats
Mini Melee's stat system is straightforwardly designed into 2 stats, Damage and Health. Meaning Damage dealt will exactly reduce Health count and Health count will exactly endure Damage dealt. Due to parrying and evading will depend on the player's performance.
Players when leveled up are always given 2 stat points which they can either put in either Damage or Health. They are given the opportunity to be flexible on whatever type of play they want. Either Attacker-type, Tank-type or Balance-type.
The same applies for equipment. There will be equipment that are better in Health, some are better in Damage and some are completely balanced to fulfill the 3 set of roles without having any of the 3 as better from another.
This way, play style isn't limited and players can perform unique set of combat combination, make situation wise builds and adjust depending on party or raid they belong and monsters or players they will battle


Gathering & Crafting
Mini Melee's gathering system is purely designed on hunting materials by defeating monsters. While crafting system is hierarchically designed as tier based equipment.
White-tier Equipment require materials dropped by Common Monsters and materials sold by a Friendly NPC.
Orange-tier Equipment requires a prerequisite base White-tier equipment and materials dropped by Elite Monsters. 
Golden-tier Equipment requires a prerequisite base Orange-tier and materials dropped by Boss Monsters.
For Example: Slime drops Slime Eye and Slime Goo plus Ore sold by NPC, you can craft it for a White-tier weapon and by crafting it with Elite Slime's Cat Ears and Tail, you can craft it for an Orange-tier weapon and ultimately by crafting it with Slime King's Mustache, you can craft it for a Golden-tier weapon. (Reminder: This is only an example.)



Equipment & Costumes
Mini Melee's weapon system is specifically designed as weapons to be used only for short range combat, they vary in size, shape, texture, color, theme and animation. Examples are Axe, Hammer, Gauntlet, Katana, Knife, Lance, Rapier, Scythe, Sword, etc.
While Armor system is solely designed to increase stats only due to the character's clothing appearance will be overwritten by Costumes which are either personalized or customized designs that follows a certain theme or an event.



With the addition of Offhand equipment, it will distinct attackers more from the tanks due to Off-hand Shields are dedicated only for giving HP stats while Off-hand Weapons are dedicated only for giving DMG stats.
Players can still switch accordingly if they either want to wield Off-hand weapon or shields at any time when out of combat. 



Battle & Combat

With the availability to move in 8 direction, it allows the player to attack in any direction within 360 degrees giving the 3D effect in a 2.5D environment.
Due to Weapons are all i short range, it requires the player to hone their skills in dodging, reacting, predicting and attacking precisely which is the game's goal, to offer a complete player-performance game.





Game Engine
Mini Melee is currently being developed using Unity3D Engine.
It's globally known for developing high-end games both in 2D or 3D.
It is also one of the Top 5 Game Engines that is purely dedicated on developing games that is user and developer friendly.
With the use of Unity3D Engine, it will allow us to develop and publish our games in cross-platforms like Windows, Mac, Android and iOS.

Community
Mini Melee's community will be a place where we will provide 24/7 player support and moderation with a less than an hour response in-game or not.
Players, Veterans and Game Masters (Moderators, Developers and Leaders) will coexist in the game to assure safe and secured gaming experience.
Meaning, players can regularly see and chat with available Game Masters online in the game and ultimately play with them on events, hunts and raids.
However, Game Masters aren't allowed to trade players and be included in a trade between players. Both players are only liable for their gains/losses. Game Masters will never ask/give/return items.
Observed dedicated player applicants may be promoted to a Game Veteran and become a part of the Player Support Team to provide a better in-game/forum assistance for other players.
Game Veterans are still players, meaning they can still trade with other players, but they have additional in-game powers for player assistance. For example, they can fly in every floor and in any location like Game Masters can.
Ultimately, if Game Veterans are observed as completely dedicated on their activity and performance, they may be promoted as an Official Game Master not only in Mini Melee but also in all game projects of The Exceeds.




Budget
Mini Melee's budget include salaries, rents, utilities, equipment, legal costs and other sort of business activities that will require financial support ahead.
The Exceeds team have decided to set the $10,000 as a minimum starting line to continue the development. With the continuous support and contribution of people in the IndieGoGo community, we'll be able to expand our team and be able to fasten our development while increasing and delivering decent results and updates to our user which will serve as our stretch goal.
If you have noticed, $10,000 is very low to support the development funds and would actually support only a single developer in a month considering the scale of this game project. Some of us have been using our own pockets already just to keep the development running because we really wanted to make this game project possible and hopefully release a Single-Player prototype demo of the game to give the users a feel of the game.
The Team
The Exceeds Team is composed of members who have been in the gaming industry for many years, if not, decades. All of them were originally players before and they're able to pinpoint what's good and bad about a game from its basic to complex features within a user's perspective which comes from their experience to be applied in the development.
Mini Melee is a big game project and certainly we would need to expand our team by adding more talented developers especially artists and designers suitable for the nature of Mini Melee which we can't make it possible without your support.

Further more, qualified battle rappers and battle rap league owners will be eligible to enjoy in an advertising revenue sharing program designed by FBR to put money back into the hands of the skilled rappers and league owners who make it all happen. 
Battle Rap is a creative and entertaining art in its own and FBR is not only dedicated to supporting the industry's growth and recognition, but also in making it more accessible to fans worldwide.  


WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU'LL GET 


We're a trio of Boston-based locals who have put in all we have to start Fantasy Battle Rap and we're trying to raise $15,000 through our crowdfunding campaign to continue the development of our platform. The funds will be used to pay for additional resources and custom programming needed to further build and enhance the gaming platform. Even if we do not meet our goal, all funds raised go to the Fantasy Battle Rap, LLC and will be used to pay for intended purposes stated above. However, we're dedicated to making this happen and with you're help we can go further.  
All donations are appreciated! Contributors can receive cool perks such as shout-outs on our social media accounts, FBR merchandise, and even VIP tickets to our official launch battle rap event taking place in October 2015. 
If that wasn't exciting enough, one lucky contributor will have the chance to battle Chilla Jones (www.chillajones.com) in front of a live crowd and video stream on our platform!!

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Hey there, my name's Andreas Malessa. I've been organising gaming events, tournaments and parties in Cologne, Germany under the brands ""Barcraft Cologne"" and ""Bar of Legends Cologne"" for more than three years now. Over these years, I got lots of experiences in gastronomy, event management, marketing and of course I'm a huge gaming and esports addict!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We want gaming, eSports and nerd culture to grow (up) - from side events in a rented bar into something bigger! We want to build a place where all kinds of nerds can feel at home and share their passion with people alike!<br/></p>
<p>This can't happen if  our events stay the ""hobby"" they have been, limiting our time and financial ressources. That's why we want to open up our own dedicated gaming, esports &amp; nerd bar in Cologne! </p>
<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, a bar like this costs a lot - and banks don't like to fund neither gaming nor gastronomy projects. That's why we need your support!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What you give &amp; what you'll get</h3>
<p>For the whole bar we'll need around 75,000 €. With our crowdfunding goal of 25,000 € we'll be able to get a regular credit to finance the bar. The more money we raise the easier the financing will become and the safer we can calculate.<br/>If we don't raise enough money we'll either try to get our funding with whatever we get or we'll pay back everything (minus the 5% that indiegogo takes).<br/>We have some unique perks that are only available once and many more common perks. Unique perks are for example signed, not obtainable WCS trading cards I collected over the last year or some of our selfmade gaming cookie cutters.<br/>The common perks include free drinks in our bar, tshirts that will only be produced for this event and never availabe again, <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438648836/g7uhusy2nlzedywjtky9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>- every donor gets a unique number on his/her shirt -<br/>behind-the-scenes material, your name engraved on elements in the bar or special memberships that grant you free drinks with every visit. <br/>Furthermore, everyone will get additional extras whenever we reach certain goals.

Today it is a global force with over 30,000 staff helping many of the world’s most desperate people. They give up their day jobs, leave their comfort zone, and move far away from their families, to work for MSF as doctors, nurses, logisticians, water and sanitation experts, and in many other capacities. They are one of the world’s most efficiently run charities, and one with the most impact. Their stories, their bravery, and the everyday challenges they face and overcome to bring even basic treatments to disaster-stricken places is almost impossible for most of us to comprehend. These are real world heroes, not the ones that popular media feed us. They should be our role models, so let’s create a game that unlocks the humanitarian inside all of us.</p><p><strong>What do we need from you?</strong></p><p>Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is backing this project and has offered ongoing collaboration and support but as a medical aid charity they are unable to contribute financially with their donor’s money.</p><p>So, to make this game a reality, we need your financial support, but as well as sourcing funds, we also recruiting your beautiful minds, your imagination, your ability to problem solve, and your curiosity! We want your help to create this amazing game and no previous experience or coding knowledge is necessary. You’ve all seen the power of crowdfunding, and your donations will help us get the game off the ground, but what we really want is your help to create the game itself.</p><p><strong>A community of gamers</strong></p><p>Through a specially designed forum (run by ANewMission.org), we will  brainstorm ideas and collaborate on how to create a mobile game that will directly impact Doctors Without Borders’ (MSF) work. Alongside MSF staff and top game designers, our IndieGoGO backers will be part of a dynamic community focused on making an innovative mobile game with real impact, the likes of which has never been done!</p><p>Development of the game will  happen over several months but as a community member you'll be free to dip in and out of the project, contributing as much or as little as you’d like. By crowdsourcing ideas in this way, we believe the process will be fun and creative, and allow people from all over the world to come together and bounce ideas off each other!</p><p>We’d like you to be involved in any way you can, but  if you’d just like to give some money to support this project, that’s fantastic too.  We are incredibly grateful for any contribution you can make and we’re offering some great perks so check them out.</p><p><strong>How will we use the money?</strong></p><p>At this stage, we are not trying to raise money for a  finished  game - we’re just seeking development funding. We are in touch with big games developers and they are already very interested in helping us make the game.  We are confident they will, but they need a fully developed pitch, complete with artwork, and basic prototypes before they invest. It’s a seriously exciting challenge, and we are thrilled to invite you to be a part of this special community.</p><p>We’re seeking $50,000 but of course, the more we can raise, the further we can take this game. However, if we don’t raise enough to develop this game any further we plan to donate it to MSF. In addition, if there’s any money left over from the development phase, we would donate that to MSF as well - so please make sure you're happy for us to do that before donating to this IndieGoGo campaign.   </p><p>So here’s a bit more detail about how we plan to use the money we raise:</p><p>-  Development of the concept  with games developers and executive producers Games 4 Change, Mediadante (the producers),  2conleche and of course Doctors Without Borders and the our IndieGoGo community</p><p>- Commissioning storyboard artists, prototypes, and mock-ups  </p><p>-  Providing workshops for for MSF field staff  with extensive real-world  experience so they can be a part of the development phase to make it as realistic as possible.</p><p>-  Testing of the concept with gamers and market research.</p><p>-  The creation of a visually exciting package online and in print that we can present to the game developers</p><p>-  Economy travel to and from investors meetings in the UK and abroad so they can say, “Yes, let’s enter this brave new world of socially beneficial gaming together”.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467193563/pwxjh2ojggtlp2pefbgu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Who’s on  the team?</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/msf.english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doctors Without Borders (MSF) </a>- from the frontline to the back office people across MSF are excited about the possibilities of sharing their everyday extraordinary experiences with the world and the opportunity to reach new audiences.</p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Mediadante/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mediadante</a> - award-winning documentary makers, this team has long worked to find fresh ways to tell MSF's story and new paths for easy donations to keep their work alive.

And when you’re on the frontline of war zones, deadly diseases, and natural disasters it’s almost impossible.We are creating a mobile game that will allow you to step into the shoes of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and experience what’s it’s like working to save lives under the most extreme conditions with only limited supplies.This game is unique in its capacity to enable players to help real people from the other side of the planet through an easy to use ‘donate’ button - money from which will be given directly to MSF.We all sit on the sofa or bus, watch a news clip from the other side of the world and think “that is awful,” yet very few of us find a way to make a real difference. The staff of Doctors Without Borders risk their own lives to save the lives of people far, far away every single day.  Mediadante (BAFTA-Nominated producers of “Escape from Isis”) want to work with YOU to make a powerful game that, just by playing, gives all of us the chance  to make a difference.¡Haz click aquí para leer la presentación en castellano!What is the game?This mobile game gives players the chance to experience for themselves the unthinkable situations faced by humanitarian workers on the frontline of conflicts, epidemics, and natural disasters. Based on the work of the medical aid organisation, Doctors Without Borders (MSF),  this is a highly playable, slightly addictive (in a good way) game, that gives everyone the chance to make an impact through the sharing of knowledge and direct donations.Before we get into details we want to make clear that ultimately we want the game to be shaped, invented and reinvented by you, the gamer. We have established a broad framework for the game but everything from the final title of the game, the storyline, scenarios, and even the logo, will be created collaboratively with our community of gamers.The basic gaming dynamic could be similar to Plague Inc. , This War of Mine or The Sims or any other real time strategy game in which players need to solve a problem with limited resources, while up against forces beyond their control.There are different characters to choose from, (different roles in MSF) and multiple scenarios in which you could find yourself.The game is set in an imaginary region of the world where  every potential disaster is possible.Through different challenges the user must learn the game controls and the different activities of each character (all professionals used by MSF on its missions: Doctors, Nurses, Constructors, Logistics Specialists, Communication Officers)Then you step into the shoes of one of those people - you create, build and then become your own hero. You have to make life and death decisions.Once the first disaster hits they will keep coming and growing in difficulty as the game evolves.Each scenario or ‘mission’  is introduced with an in-game video feed that may include real-world archive footage  of past emergencies, helping to ground the imaginary world of the game in the reality of the world it reflects. Gamers can click through to the forum to find out more about what happened in the past, giving them context and content to help them play the game more efficiently and discuss real world events and problems.The user must also build different facilities; field hospitals, shelters, refugee camps water and sanitation stations to assist their mission.Each mission is set in the same virtual world  but has a different emergency  unfolding:
Natural disasters - Earthquakes, floods, hurricane, tsunami
Famine
War and conflict
Disease outbreak
Extreme poverty - long term health effects
 Why are we making this game?We would like to tell the story of MSF through a mobile game in order to:- raise key awareness of humanitarian emergencies and global medical problems,- Engage a community of socially-minded or just casual gamers in the work of Doctors Without Borders (MSF)  - help raise crucial funding for this brave organisation to continue their work in over 60 countriesOur aim is to reach beyond basic storytelling and give people a real insight into what’s like to be part of an MSF team working under extreme conditions.Although the game is set in a fictional world, it draws upon the rich seam of real life stories and experiences of MSF staff, responding to events such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the humanitarian crisis in Syria, and the earthquakes in Nepal and HaitiThe physical, medical, moral and logistical challenges Doctors Without Borders face under extreme time pressure are very much real. Their staff  have a set of tools (vehicles, medical equipment, ‘inflatable’ hospitals etc) and resources (medicines, fuel, staff etc)  which they have to use and manage a with great care and expertise.  They also make life or death decisions such as where and when to intervene in a humanitarian emergency, that determines the fate of thousands.  Who are  Doctors Without Borders (MSF)?Doctors without Borders (also known by its French name Medecins Sans Frontieres - or ‘MSF’ for short) is  an international humanitarian-aid organisation and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, that was founded in France in 1971. Today it is a global force with over 30,000 staff helping many of the world’s most desperate people. They give up their day jobs, leave their comfort zone, and move far away from their families, to work for MSF as doctors, nurses, logisticians, water and sanitation experts, and in many other capacities. They are one of the world’s most efficiently run charities, and one with the most impact. Their stories, their bravery, and the everyday challenges they face and overcome to bring even basic treatments to disaster-stricken places is almost impossible for most of us to comprehend. These are real world heroes, not the ones that popular media feed us. They should be our role models, so let’s create a game that unlocks the humanitarian inside all of us.What do we need from you?Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is backing this project and has offered ongoing collaboration and support but as a medical aid charity they are unable to contribute financially with their donor’s money.So, to make this game a reality, we need your financial support, but as well as sourcing funds, we also recruiting your beautiful minds, your imagination, your ability to problem solve, and your curiosity! We want your help to create this amazing game and no previous experience or coding knowledge is necessary. You’ve all seen the power of crowdfunding, and your donations will help us get the game off the ground, but what we really want is your help to create the game itself.A community of gamersThrough a specially designed forum (run by ANewMission.org), we will  brainstorm ideas and collaborate on how to create a mobile game that will directly impact Doctors Without Borders’ (MSF) work. Alongside MSF staff and top game designers, our IndieGoGO backers will be part of a dynamic community focused on making an innovative mobile game with real impact, the likes of which has never been done!Development of the game will  happen over several months but as a community member you'll be free to dip in and out of the project, contributing as much or as little as you’d like. By crowdsourcing ideas in this way, we believe the process will be fun and creative, and allow people from all over the world to come together and bounce ideas off each other!We’d like you to be involved in any way you can, but  if you’d just like to give some money to support this project, that’s fantastic too.  We are incredibly grateful for any contribution you can make and we’re offering some great perks so check them out.How will we use the money?At this stage, we are not trying to raise money for a  finished  game - we’re just seeking development funding. We are in touch with big games developers and they are already very interested in helping us make the game.  We are confident they will, but they need a fully developed pitch, complete with artwork, and basic prototypes before they invest. It’s a seriously exciting challenge, and we are thrilled to invite you to be a part of this special community.We’re seeking $50,000 but of course, the more we can raise, the further we can take this game. However, if we don’t raise enough to develop this game any further we plan to donate it to MSF. In addition, if there’s any money left over from the development phase, we would donate that to MSF as well - so please make sure you're happy for us to do that before donating to this IndieGoGo campaign.   So here’s a bit more detail about how we plan to use the money we raise:-  Development of the concept  with games developers and executive producers Games 4 Change, Mediadante (the producers),  2conleche and of course Doctors Without Borders and the our IndieGoGo community- Commissioning storyboard artists, prototypes, and mock-ups  -  Providing workshops for for MSF field staff  with extensive real-world  experience so they can be a part of the development phase to make it as realistic as possible.-  Testing of the concept with gamers and market research.-  The creation of a visually exciting package online and in print that we can present to the game developers-  Economy travel to and from investors meetings in the UK and abroad so they can say, “Yes, let’s enter this brave new world of socially beneficial gaming together”.Who’s on  the team?Doctors Without Borders (MSF) - from the frontline to the back office people across MSF are excited about the possibilities of sharing their everyday extraordinary experiences with the world and the opportunity to reach new audiences.Mediadante - award-winning documentary makers, this team has long worked to find fresh ways to tell MSF's story and new paths for easy donations to keep their work alive. Rosie Garthwaite's award-winning book which gives a third of its profits to MSF, How To Avoid Being Killed in a War Zone, is part of the inspiration for this game.Eduardo Celorio - the founder of 2conleche,  A digital strategy consulting company specialising in creating interaction and gamification between content and the audience. The company is involved in several successful projects such as tusrelatos.com, the largest community of short stories in Spanish, and several trivia games produced in different formats.Anew Mission – A young company that connects the world in doing good. They have built the platform we will be using to co-create the game. It has been especially designed for collaborative innovation. And teaches us how to solve problems creatively.Playback Interactive - was formed in 2014 with the goal of producing high quality, innovative titles on mobile platforms. They like to produce rapid prototypes and get quick user feedback to determine good projects to pursue full time and also to deliver the most enjoyable experiences possible for potential users. As of February this year they signed a publishing deal with All 4 Games, a games publishing arm of Channel 4 set up to support creative talent within the mobile games sector. CASTELLANOMSF - [IT’S NO GAME]¡Salvar vidas nunca es fácil! Y cuando estás en la primera línea de zonas de guerra, ante enfermedades mortales o frente a desastres naturales es casi imposible.Estamos creando un juego móvil que te permitirá ponerte en la piel de Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) y vivir lo que significa trabajar para salvar vidas en las condiciones más extremas y con recursos limitados.Es sencillo sentarse en el sofá, ver las noticias que provienen del otro lado del mundo y pensar: “esto es horrible, quiero hacer algo”. La realidad es que pocas personas pueden realmente hacer algo para que cambien las cosas. El personal de Médicos Sin Fronteras sí puede, y cada día arriesgan sus vidas para salvar a personas que viven y sufren en lugares muy, muy lejanos.Desde Mediadante (productores de ""Escape de Isis"" documental nominado a un BAFTA) y 2conleche (consultora estratégica de marketing online) queremos trabajar contigo para hacer un juego de gran alcance que, solo por jugarlo, te dé la oportunidad de marcar la diferencia y ayudar a los más necesitados.¿Qué es It’s No Game?Un juego móvil que da a los jugadores la oportunidad de experimentar por sí mismos las situaciones impensables a las que se enfrentan los trabajadores humanitarios en la primera línea de los conflictos, epidemias y desastres naturales. Basado en el trabajo de la ONG de ayuda médica, Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF), estamos ante un juego divertido y un poco adictivo (en el buen sentido), que te dará la oportunidad de hacer un verdadero impacto en el mundo a través del intercambio de conocimientos (Crowd-Knowledge)y donaciones directas a MSF.Antes de entrar en detalles queremos dejar claro que en última instancia, queremos que el juego sea construido, inventado y reinventado por ti: el jugador. Hemos establecido las líneas básicas pero todo, desde el título final, la historia, los escenarios e incluso el logotipo, se creará en colaboración con nuestra comunidad de jugadores.La dinámica básica del juego podría ser similar a Plague Inc., This War of Mine, The Sims o cualquier otro juego de estrategia en tiempo real. Los jugadores tienen que resolver problemas con recursos limitados mientras luchan contra fuerzas fuera de su control.Hay diferentes personajes para elegir, (que son los diferentes profesionales que trabajan en MSF) y múltiples escenarios en los que podrías encontrarte.El juego se desarrolla en una región imaginaria del mundo en la que todo desastre potencial es posible.A través de diferentes retos los usuarios deberán aprender los controles del juego y las diferentes actividades de cada personaje (todos los profesionales que acuden con MSF en sus misiones: médicos, enfermeras, constructores, especialistas en logística, responsables de comunicación, etc.).A continuación entras en la piel de una de estas personas - creas, construyes y terminas por convertirte en tu propio héroe. Tienes que tomar decisiones de vida o muerte.Una vez llegue el primer desastre, no vas a poder parar. Conforme avanzas en el juego los desastres te seguirán golpeando y creciendo en dificultad.Cada escenario o ""misión"" se introduce con una secuencia de vídeo que puede incluir imágenes de archivo de emergencias reales que ya han sucedido. Esto ayudará a los jugadores a que puedan comprender mejor el mundo imaginario del juego y la realidad que este mundo refleja. Además, los jugadores podrán ir al foro para averiguar más acerca de lo sucedido en el pasado, obtener contexto y contenidos de ayuda para ser más eficiente en la misión. Además, el foro servirá para discutir acontecimientos y problemas del mundo real.El usuario también debe construir diferentes instalaciones; hospitales de campaña, refugios, campos de refugiados y estaciones de saneamiento y agua potable para ayudar en la misión.Cada misión sucede en el mismo mundo virtual. Lo que cambia son las diferentes emergencia que se van desarrollando:
Desastres naturales - terremotos, inundaciones, huracanes, tsunamis
Hambruna
Guerras y conflictos armados
Epidemias de enfermedades
Extrema pobreza - efectos sobre la salud a largo plazo
¿Por qué hacemos este juego?
Nos gustaría contar la historia de MSF a través de un juego para móviles con la finalidad de: el fin de:
Sensibilizar a la población de las emergencias humanitarias y los problemas de salud mundiales.
Crear una comunidad de jugadores con mentalidad social alrededor del trabajo de Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF).
Ayudar a aumentar los fondos de esta valiente ONG para que pueda continuar su trabajo en más de 60 países.
Aunque el juego se desarrolla en un mundo de ficción, se basa en la rica veta de historias reales y experiencias del personal de MSF en respuesta a acontecimientos como la epidemia de Ébola en África occidental, la crisis humanitaria en Siria y los terremotos en Nepal y Haití.Este juego es único en su capacidad de permitir que los jugadores ayuden a personas reales al otro lado del planeta a través de un botón “donar” - que enviará dinero directamente a MSF.Los desafíos físicos, médicos, morales y logísticos a los que Médicos Sin Fronteras se enfrenta bajo extrema presión, son una realidad diaria para los voluntarios de esta organización. El personal de MSF tiene un conjunto de herramientas (vehículos, equipos médicos, hospitales inflables, etc.) y recursos (medicamentos, combustible, personal, etc.) que tienen que usar y administrar con gran cuidado y experiencia. También toman decisiones de vida o muerte, cómo dónde y cuándo intervenir en una situación de emergencia humanitaria. Estas decisiones determinan el destino de miles de personas.¿Quiénes son Médicos Sin Fronteras?Médicos sin Fronteras (también conocido por su nombre en francés MEDECINS SANS FRONTIERES o ""MSF"" para abreviar) es una organización internacional de ayuda humanitaria y Premio Nobel de la Paz, que fue fundada en Francia en 1971. Hoy en día es una fuerza global con más de 30.000 empleados que ayudan a muchas de las personas más desesperadas del mundo. Son personas que dejan sus trabajos, salen de su zona de confort y dejan a sus familias para trabajar en MSF como médicos, enfermeros, especialistas en logística, expertos en potabilización de agua y saneamiento y en muchas otros roles necesarios. MSF es una de las ONG más eficiente del mundo y con mayor impacto. Para la mayoría de nosotros es casi imposible comprender sus historias, valentía y los retos diarios a los que se enfrentan para lograr llevar los tratamientos más básicos a los lugares afectados por desastres. Estos sí son héroes reales, muy diferentes de los que la cultura popular nos ofrecer. Deben ser nuestros modelo, y por esta razón vamos a crear este juego con el fin de abrir la vena humanitaria dentro de todos nosotros.Nuestro objetivo es llegar más allá de la narración básica y dar a la gente una visión real de lo que es ser parte de un equipo de MSF que trabaja en condiciones extremas.¿Qué necesitamos de ti?Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) apoya este proyecto y nos ha ofrecido su colaboración permanente, pero como organización benéfica que son no son capaces de contribuir económicamente con el dinero de sus donantes.Por lo tanto, para hacer este juego una realidad, necesitamos tu apoyo financiero. Pero además de los fondos de abastecimiento, también necesitamos tu creatividad, tu imaginación, tu capacidad para resolver problemas y tu curiosidad. Queremos que tu ayuda para crear este juego increíble. No es necesarios tener experiencia previa o conocimiento de programación. Todos conocemos el poder del crowdfunding y sí, tus donaciones nos ayudarán a conseguir que el juego despegue, pero lo que realmente queremos es tu ayuda para crear el juego en sí mismo.Una comunidad de jugadoresA través de un foro especialmente diseñado (desarrollado por ANewMission.org), vamos a pensar en ideas y colaborar en la forma de crear un juego para móviles que impactará directamente en el trabajo de Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF). Junto con el personal de MSF y los mejores diseñadores de juegos, nuestros patrocinadores Indiegogo serán parte de una comunidad dinámica centrada en hacer un juego para móviles innovador y con impacto real como nunca se ha hecho.El desarrollo del juego durará varios meses, pero como miembro de la comunidad serás libre de entrar y salir del proyecto y de contribuir tanto o tan poco como desees. Creemos que esta forma para generar ideas va a ser divertido y creativo. Sobretodo va a permitir que gente de todo el mundo se reúna y comparta ideas entre sí.Nos gustaría que te involucres tanto como quieras y puedas. No obstante, si no quieres participar del desarrollo y lo que te apetece es darnos un poco de dinero para apoyar este proyecto, nos parece fantástico también. Estamos muy agradecidos de cualquier contribución que puedas hacer. Revisa todos los regalos que ofrecemos y escoge el que más te apetezca.¿Cómo vamos a usar el dinero?En esta etapa no estamos tratando de recaudar dinero para terminar el juego, sólo estamos buscando financiación para el desarrollo. Estamos en contacto con grandes desarrolladores de juegos que están muy interesados ​​en ayudarnos a hacer esto una realidad. Estamos seguros de que lo harán, pero antes de invertir en este proyecto necesitamos presentarles un concepto totalmente desarrollado, con arte finales y prototipos básicos. Estamos ante un reto emocionante y encantados de invitarte a ser parte de esta comunidad especial.Nuestro objetivo es recaudar $ 50.000 pero, como casi siempre, cuantos más fondos podamos conseguir mejor, Sin embargo, si no conseguimos obtener los fondos suficiente para desarrollar este juego tenemos la intención de donar todas vuestras donaciones a MSF. Por supuesto, si hay algo de dinero sobrante de la fase de desarrollo también lo donaremos a MSF. Por favor, asegúrate que este planteamiento te gusta antes de donar en esta campaña IndieGoGo.Aquí tienes más detalle acerca de cómo planeamos utilizar el dinero que recaudemos:
Desarrollo del concepto con los desarrolladores de juegos y los productores ejecutivos Playback Interactive, Mediadante, 2conleche (los productores) y, por supuesto, Médicos sin Fronteras y tú, como parte la comunidad que se una a esta aventura.
Propuesta gráfica, storyboard, prototipos y maquetas
Talleres para personal de campo de MSF con amplia experiencia en el mundo real. Buscamos conocer su experiencia para hacer un juego lo más realista posible.
Prueba del concepto con jugadores y estudio de mercado.
Creación de un paquete visualmente emocionante para presentar a los posibles inversores del juego.
Costes relacionados con las reuniones con inversores en el Reino Unido y en el extranjero. Buscamos que nos digan: ""Sí, queremos ser parte de este nuevo mundo de juegos sociales"".
¿De qué otras formas beneficiará este juego a Médicos sin Fronteras?El juego estará directamente vinculada a un Foro (gestionado por anewmission.org) - online para debatir y discutir ""misiones"" dentro del juego y los problemas del mundo real.El objetivo del juego es entretener, educar, crear conciencia y obtener fondos para MSF.El objetivo último del foro es crear una herramienta que MSF puede utilizar para consultar a la comunidad de jugadores sobre necesidades que surjan en el terreno.El primer desafío, o ""misión"", de este foro será hacer realidad este juego, pues como te hemos contado queremos que la comunidad no sólo participe con ayudas económicas sino que se involucre en el desarrollo del mismo. ¿Estás listo para jugar?¿Quién es el equipo?Médicos Sin Fronteras (MSF) - desde aquellos en primera línea hasta las personas que trabajan en la parte administrativa de MSF están entusiasmados con las posibilidades de compartir sus experiencias extraordinarias con el mundo y la posibilidad de llegar a nuevos públicos.Mediadante - premiados documentalistas, este equipo ha trabajado durante mucho tiempo para encontrar nuevas maneras de contar la historia de MSF y encontrar nuevas vías de financiación para que el trabajo de esta ONG siga adelante. Rosie Garthwaite, autora del premiado libro How To Avoid Being Killed in a War Zone, da una tercera parte de sus beneficios a MSF y es parte de la inspiración de este juego.2conleche - Una consultora de estrategia digital especializada en crear dinámicas de interacción (gamificación) entre los contenidos y su público. Dirigida por Edu Celorio participa en varios proyectos exitosos como tusrelatos.com, la mayor comunidad de relatos en español, y varios juegos de trivia producidos en distintos formatos.Anew Mission - Una empresa joven que conecta el mundo para hacer el bien. Esta empresa ha desarrollado la plataforma, el foro, que se va a utilizar para co-crear el juego. Esta plataforma ha sido diseñada para fomentar la innovación colaborativa y tiene como objetivo enseñarnos cómo resolver problemas de forma creativa.Playback Interactive -  fundada en 2014 con el objetivo de producir aplicaciones de alta calidad e innovadores títulos para plataformas móviles. A ellos les gusta producir prototipos rápidos y obtener retroalimentación de los usuarios para determinar buenos proyectos que merezca la pena perseguir a tiempo completo. Buscan entregar una experiencia lo más agradables posible a los usuarios.

<p>Bringing Leonardo Bridge to its
current level has been a <b>100% individual initiative</b>, by two Greek bridge
enthusiasts who, empowered by their passion for the game, devoted their free
time to create this unique platform so that all bridge lovers can have an
online place to get together and get to know each other. The initial idea was
to make this environment accessible to anyone, and this is why we haven’t
considered Leonardo as a profit-making platform.</p>
<p><b>However, in order to further develop the
game, we need to enlarge our team, and since there are no revenues coming from
the game itself, we turned to Indiegogo’s crowdfunding platform. </b></p>

<p>After many hours of calculations, we
concluded that a <b>35.000 $</b> funding not only will enable us to employ the right

Bringing Leonardo Bridge to its
current level has been a 100% individual initiative, by two Greek bridge
enthusiasts who, empowered by their passion for the game, devoted their free
time to create this unique platform so that all bridge lovers can have an
online place to get together and get to know each other. The initial idea was
to make this environment accessible to anyone, and this is why we haven’t
considered Leonardo as a profit-making platform.
However, in order to further develop the
game, we need to enlarge our team, and since there are no revenues coming from
the game itself, we turned to Indiegogo’s crowdfunding platform. 
 

After many hours of calculations, we
concluded that a 35.000 $ funding not only will enable us to employ the right
professionals and acquire all the necessary software/hardware to upgrade
Leonardo Bridge, but it will also allow us to help in our turn the “Athens Association of Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Disorder”. So when you claim any of our perks, your
financial support will be distributed as follows: 

62% for App Design & Development for iOS & Android, Live
     tournaments Design & developemnt, hardware/software upgrade
19% cost of perks
14% Indiegogo, PayPal, taxes
5% Donation to the “Athens
     Association of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorder”

BEYOND
MONEY: OTHER WAYS TO HELP US 
Money makes the world go round, it’s true,
but there are also other ways to help us make that great leap forward for online
bridge playing. 

Talk about Leonardo Bridge and our goals to your bridge partners
     and/or your association/club. 
Share our Indiegogo campaign with the world by simply clicking
     on the social media links below 
Write a story about us if you are a journalist or blogger
Feel free to give us feedback, concerning both our campaign and
     perks but also Leonardo Bridge at its current state! We look forward to meeting
     you at Leonardo’s Facebook Game Page.

Thank you a million for your
support! 

Leonardo
Bridge was conceived and designed by Achilles Charmpilas and Vasiliki Nika,
two Greeks with a unique passion for bridge. Achilles has been developing
computer programs for more than a decade. Vasiliki is a music composer, online
marketing entrepreneur, member of the Greek Bridge Association and bridge instructor amongst other
things. Together they have developed a wide variety of products, among which an innovative sports article generation engine. 

Leonardo is also supported by Konstantinos Kontomitros, a Greek Bridge expert, who is ready to share his knowledge and experience with bridge players in Leonardo Bridge, from all over the world. 
More details about the entire team you can find here.
 


We are offering a wide range of perks to cover all tastes and budgets. You can be among the first to have access to the new mobile LeonardoBridge App with as little as US$ 15, or get a Leonardo Mug, or a special Leonardo T-shirt or Leonardo Sweater, or all 3 of them by ordering the Leonardo Combo pack!


You can also enhance your bridge playing level with the Leonardo Masterclass perk, or by one of the very few Leonardo VIP members in live tournaments!
The new Leonardo Bridge is just a step away. But we can’t make this step without you.
Please make your contribution before our campaign expires, to help us raise the necessary 35.000 $ for the Leonardo Bridge upgrade.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

 What is “Reclaim”? It is a third-person, adventure puzzler game in which you have one very important mission: to recover Earth’s long lost history.  Earth has become inhospitable due to catastrophic events caused by humans, forcing them to evacuate the planet and colonize others. Centuries later, humanity sends a robot to Earth to recover our long lost history for us to share to our future generations.  

After centuries of not being on Earth, humans don’t know how the atmosphere has changed, or what they will encounter on the planet, so they send Space Probe Centurion model VLKR-5 to explore it. The probe has been equipped with state-of-the-art life support systems, the latest in radar and scanning technologies, and an exoskeleton made to withstand even the harshest of climates, be it bone-chilling cold temperatures or rock-melting heat. All of these capabilities will be at the player’s disposal, and are essential to exploring the familiar but unknown Earth.

</ul></div></div>","What is this again?
Project OpenHattan is an initiative with a specific goal to create an accurate and complete virtual Manhattan. We think it is time gamers are finally given a realistic, detailed, real-scale, authentic 3D model to play with. We want to recreate every building, street, sidewalk and park as an exact top-quality textured 3D model. All of it made specifically to be used in real-time applications and games. 
Our idea is to harness the power of the gaming and CG community and create a virtual urban environment of before unseen size and detail. That's 70000 buildings in a 21km x 5km area and over 800km of streets. Just to give you an idea of the scale, here is a comparison with some of the best virtual cities:Once created, the model will be FREE to use by ANYONE. So, whether you are a gamer, CG artist, developer or a virtual tourist there are enough reasons to get excited about bringing the FIRST EVER complete and detailed  3D model of Manhattan to the public.All the funds from this campaign will go into creating the resource. Most of it will go back to the modding and CG communities as rewards for creating 3D models. Anyone with the required skills can participate in the modeling stage and GET PAID in return. (read on for more on that)ImpactJust what would the existence of such a massive resource mean to the gaming and CG scene? We think it will create a big splash and see customers benefiting in several ways: 

Gamers get the ultimate urban playground. Manhattan is not only huge, it is astonishing. Diverse and rich neighborhoods intertwine to create the greatest borough of the greatest city. You could spend months just exploring areas and finding hidden jewels everywhere.

Developers gain a free setting for their projects, allowing them to focus time and money into the rest of their pipelines. Eventually gamers will get to enjoy new ideas and developments in better and more polished games. 

CG artists can utilize a free resource for both their professional and personal projects, saving them time and money while improving the quality of their work.

Virtual explorers will be able to roam the streets of Manhattan in the virtual reality of Occulus Rift or similar products. Imagine flying over central park, between downtown skyscrapers or under the Manhattan bridge.
What do you get for contributing?Being excited about a studio, modder or an indie dev building something around the virtual Manhattan is not the only reason to contribute to the cause. There's actual stuff you will get if we hit the goal.

Every backer will receive an Occulus Rift enabled playable demo featuring the complete Manhattan model. You will be able to drive, walk or fly around and explore the city. It will be created either in Cryengine or UDK 4, granting it amazing visuals. Additional features may be added (we are open for suggestions). There will be multiple builds released to the backers, showing off the model throughout its modeling stages. (you won't have to wait long once modeling has started for the first glimpses of Manhattan)





You will also receive the entire 3D model complete with textures in multiple formats ready for import into real-time engines and applications. 


 (preview low-poly massing model)
Every, third party commercial project, featuring this 3D model will offer a discount to every contributor . We will be aiming for a discount of minimum $5 so you can get your contribution back with the first purchase and start saving onwards. (check perks for doubling the discount)
Anyone with enough experience in 3D modeling and texturing will be able choose a city block to model in our platform and GET PAID in return. (for rewards sizes check further down)

                           


What about existing models?There are several sources that provide models and all of them are unusable not only because of the low detail level, but also due to the lack of commercial-use licenses. Google's, satellite-derived, model is the best out there and it still is miles away from what we need. Here is a comparison between google's model and the detail of OpenHattan.






We believe advances in technology should come from the content providers. As such we want to make the next step towards creating a realistic and immersive city environment. A detail level so high, coupled with the free-to-use nature of the resource, creates a thrilling new opportunity for the future virtual scene. 

We will create an experience that's the next best thing to actually being in Manhattan. (Occulus rift anyone?)

We are also excited to see what indie developers and studios will do with it and what new and creative ways to use it they'll come up with.


How are we going to do it?
1. Survey and data acquisition

We send a team to New York to survey Manhattan and take photos of each building, street or park. All the references will be taken with 3d modeling and texturing in mind (we have years of experience in that). We want to use real images for textures as much as possible for the highest realism and accuracy. This stage alone is a massive and expensive task. 

2. Platform
We make a platform (website) where we meet the funds gathered and 3D artists (modelers) who want to create buildings, parks, roads and whatever needs to be made and GET PAID in return. The island will be divided in blocks and a reward assigned to each block, depending on complexity. It should be reiterated that ANYONE can opt in to be a modeler. We will not be modeling buildings inhouse, the project relies on interested 3D modelers contributing their skills. (for reward sizes check further down)





3. Modeling 
Modelers send us 3D models of blocks they've chosen to model and we enforce quality control. We have access to experienced specialists in architectural modeling and game artists who can make sure every model is up to the needed standard. Our primary target for the usage of the model is realtime engines and games. Models will be textured and modeled accordingly with lower GPU and CPU usage in mind and utilization of real-time techniques for the best possible visuals.4. We manage and piece the thousands of models, we have received, into a complete and seamless model.
5. We release the complete 3D model to be used freely for any kind of projects. The only rule is developers of commercial products (games, movies) will have to offer a discount to every backer of this campaign.Money talk

This campaign is flexible, meaning even if the goal isn't reached we will still receive the funds and be able to perform a part of the task. There are multiple milestones which will guarantee certain stages of the whole project will get done.
1. $0-$10 000
If the project stays below the budget needed to go and survey city blocks on site we will use the money to create a couple of blocks from data available on the Internet and volunteer the work needed to model them. They will be put in a real-time engine and released to the public as a proof of concept. Keep in mind that not having data specially gathered for the purposes and having to do it for free will take longer.
2. $10 000 
If we collect this much we will be able to gather the data for 4 city blocks and publish it in a platform for people to to pick buildings to model. We will then import the 3D models in a real-time engine and release the build. It will serve as a technical demo to promote the project and attract more people to donate for the inclusion of more city blocks.
3. $30 000

That much will ensure the photographing and surveying an area the size of Little Italy. It will also cover attaching a reward of $1000 to each city block for anyone who creates it. The result will be released in a build of the real-time demo.
4. $30 000+
The more we collect the more we will include and the bigger the rewards  thus attracting more and better qualified CG artists.
5. $200 000
If we reach this milestione we can perform the whole survey of Manhattan, collect all the data needed and launch the platform to distribute the blocks to willing to contribute modelers. Even if this is all we get to do it will form a solid base for further efforts to accomplish the idea. It will not, however be enough to offer rewards for the modeling of the buildings.
Alternatively the money could be used to photograph a couple of Manhattan areas and offer rewards for modeling them in the platform. Similarly to the $30 000 milestone this will create an initial build of the demo to be used for promotion.
6. $ 200 000+
From this  amount up to the goal we can scale the scope of the task to accomodate the funds gathered. 
The top goal of the campaign is high and it is a measure of what is needed for the full job of creating 70 000 buildings and 800km or streets. However we will still be able to work with whatever we get and recreate a proportional area of Manhattan. How big and how soon it will be ready depends, off course, on the budget.
We see OpenHattan not as a business start-up but as an experiment in how much the world wants to have this resource. It is not a product, that will generate revenue once created and has no other funding sources. The crowd-funding campaign is its ultimate test and contributions are the votes “yay”.
Before donating, please be sure you will be ok with the project finishing this campaign below the $10 000 mark. You are donating to an idea, not a product.
We understand not everyone can donate and because reaching as many, possibly interested individuals, as possible is crucial for the “elections” to work we ask you to share on FB, tweet or just tell your friends. This could sometimes contribute to the project more than a donation would.

Time frames





Photographing all the buildings and streets and gathering all the data will take about 3-4 months.


Creating the online platform to distribute the funds and city blocks will take a couple of months.


The rest is up to the public. How much will contributors gather and respectively how many modelers we will attract and how motivated they will be to do the job quickly.


The making of the interactive demo will overlap with the modeling stage, so once all the models are done, it will virtually be ready too. (beta builds will be released during the modeling process so you get to walk the streets of Manhattan much earlier than the completion date)

Why Manhattan?Maybe you are thinking we've seen enough of it. We have seen a lot, but it has mostly been the same stuff. All the famous sites have been well over-used and worn out. However, there is so much more to that borough than what we are shown in movies. When it comes to games, we've never had a city even close to being large enough to encompass the true attraction of Manhattan. It is the sheer size and diversity of areas and vibes that turn it into a place that can tell a 1000 stories. Many people don't realize how rich and intriguing this place is. It has a lot more to offer than Times square, Empire state building and Downtown. Some say you need to spend months with it to understand it. After all if you had one shot at doing this wouldn't it be Manhattan?We understand having just the island is silly. You have to be able to see the rest of the boroughs and you will. We will create the visible, from the island, parts of the other boroughs for a complete immersion. About usMy name is Dimitar Tilev and I am the creator of the project.

""I levelled to Java skill 80 after I finished the Bug Boss in the Repo Dungeon.""""I have cleared all quest in Advanced C++ tutorial.""Does this make sense to you? We see fun for developers & students.You'll be able to download Code RPGify for free from our website once it's released (current eta, Nov 2016 if the funding succeeds). The rewards with PERKs are not available for cash, you can only reach those items by actually playing the game. We have no plan to make those IAP at least for now. It is not a coding tutorial game, it adds fun on top of your current and future programming assignments!One more thing; We need your enthusiasm not only your funding. Love, feedbacks, fun ideas and your commitment. So we will open-source the client program and some of server logic(like calculating exp, skill-tree proposals etc) to GitHub when we're ready. We have a huge goal, we know we can't go without your help. Please share our goal and become our ally!



Code + Exp

Bring some fun and motivation into your coding life. Once our client is installed, you will start gaining exp while you code. You're coding Java in Eclipse, doing some C# in Visual Studio or hacking Javascript in Sublime Text? No matter what tool or language you use, we get them all.

The Code RPGify client utilizes the node fs.watch functionality. We're all programmers, so: inotify on linux, kqueue on OS X, ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows. It depends on your OS, you get the point, don't you? ;-) Then it detects the programming language using atom linguist and analysis the amount of work. In this way you can use RPGify without any significant performance loss. And no worries! We don't cause any trouble, the client never actually reads your code or sends your code anywhere. The exp point is calculated by file size and timestamp with the file path being hashed and salted individually.


Get Equipments


Aren't you waiting for your fancy new laptop? I also want a new laptop however no money no laptop. I'm just surfing the news for the launching date & expectations, but I decided to make one and give it to my character :)
You can also make coins, not only exp points when you are coding. With the coins you've collected, you can buy your character a powerful laptop, a convenient mouse, a fancy new keyboard or widescreen monitor, it's up to you(or the liking of your character). Given gears boost your exp gain, coin digging and lower the fatigue.

Resume & Statistics

Having trouble remembering what projects you have worked on? RPGify will remember what the project was, which skills you used, how many months you worked on it and other interesting information, just for you. Oh and don't forget, there are also interesting statistics ready:  Yearly / monthly / weekly / dayly coding hours Average coding hours during weekdays Estimated compile time Project details  So. Is this a Game or What?
Here is our humble beginning: We've taken the level and equipment system from RPG games so, yeah it is a game, for now.
And as you know there are tons of great systems and mechanics in RPG games, skill trees, guilds, raids, parties, quests, chats, etc. We imagine RPGify to be integrated with all of those systems from RPG games. We think of it as more than just another RPG game. You can learn coding using the tutorial quests, check necessary skills on your skill tree as a professional developer, manage your friends list and add them from any git commit in your commit history right away, Job recruiters will call out ""Looking for more C++ developers"". Yes, at the moment this is just imagination, but we're sure it is absolutely worth a shot. Although some of those ideas might be found to be poor or might be dropped for some other reason, we haven't faced yet.
So. Again. Isn't it just a game? We certainly want it become something beyond a simple game, but still, you can play it. The one thing that is different from games is we do not characters store on your local disk. A lower level doesn't mean you are a poor developer or vice versa.

<p>You are Princess Grais, a half-elf, the illegitimate child of the Queen of Fehrton. Thought to have died at the hands of bandits, you were given into the care of peasants in a local hunting village. There you grew to be a young woman with no knowledge of your royal lineage. When the King's agents discovered the truth of your whereabouts and of the Queen's infidelity, you were to be captured and executed. But the King's own champion, sworn to protect you, rescued you from the shadow of death. You must now embark on an epic quest to learn the truth of your heritage and the nature of your destiny. A great prophecy of doom hangs over the lands and you are a central player in the drama to unfold.</p>

<u>Search:</u> Instead of having to physically search every square inch of an area, the player can initiate a skill-based search, which will reveal objects of interest in the immediate area by highlighting them. Depending on the character's skill level, the search can even reveal hidden or secret items such as secret doors.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<u>Environment Clues:</u> Things found in the environment can be essential for progressing in the game such as writing on a wall, an item on the ground, etc. For example, a quest could be triggered by simply finding a message scrawled on the wall that says ""Griffon Inn. Ask for Brayden."" </div><div><br/></div><div>
<u>Game master hints: </u>Sometimes when someone is stuck when playing a P&amp;P RPG, the GM may sense it and provide a little snippet of information to help the players progress. When GM hints are enabled, the player can opt to view one at any time. If a hint is available, the wise Game Master appears and gives the player some good advice on how best to proceed.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<u>Simulated Sensory Perception (SSP)</u>: In a P&amp;P RPG, players are often given detailed descriptions of an area or room when they first arrive. This is often embellished by the Game Master who can go so far as to tell the player what smells are in the air, the ambient temperature, or even how the place makes the character ""feel."" While a lot of this information is easily translated to the visuals that the player sees, there can still be a lot more information given to enrich the play experience. With SSP turned on, the player can see additional textual information when available that describes a place in more detail. Such information can also convey back story or historical facts about a place.</div><div>

<p>My name is Thomas Scott. I'm the president and head game designer/programmer for Magique Productions, Ltd. I started programming games on the Commodore 64 back in 1984 and have been a fan of video games from the Atari 2600 era all the way up to present day. I'm an avid role-playing gamer and author of many role-playing game adventures. I've also written teleplays, having produced my own TV pilot that aired on local TV in Las Vegas, Nevada. By day, I've been a professional programmer for the past 25+ years. I've spent the last 13 years with a gaming company developing multimedia and game operating systems for video slot machines.</p>
<p><i>Scions of Chaos: Prologue</i> is being developed on the <b>Unity 5</b> game engine. We have spent that last year honing our skills on this platform and accumulating some of the best plugins and assets available. </p>

<p>We find ourselves in a financial bind that threatens to halt our development on the Nintendo platform. Our invoice for the Nintendo Dev Kit was due on September 24th and, due to circumstances beyond our control, we were only able to pay about one-third of the total. We received an extension until November 14th, but find that we have not improved our financial situation. That is why we are reaching out to the gaming community for help to get us over this important hurdle and back on track.</p>
<p>Our first priority at this time is to get our Nintendo Dev Kit paid off and to help cover some of the development costs we've incurred thus far in regards to art and 3D content.  Here is the breakdown:</p> <ul> <li>While we can't disclose the price of a Nintendo Dev kit, it is the first priority to get it paid off. Our deadline for paying for the kit was September 24th, 2015, <b>but we've received an extension until November 14th, 2015</b>. A portion of this funding goes immediately to paying off the dev kit.</li> <li>We've incurred some costs in purchasing art and 3D content as well as 3rd party tools and scripts for speeding up the development process. We've invested in some of the best Unity assets available for making professional games. Some of the money will go to cover the costs we've already incurred out of pocket. </li> <li>If we don't reach our entire goal, all money will go towards payment of the Nintendo Dev Kit and we'll do whatever we can to come up with the difference.</li>
<li>If we should be so blessed to achieve funding beyond our development kit needs, all funds will go toward additional 3D content, music, and paying our development team for their efforts. If we see this escalate, I will update the campaign with additional stretch goals to match.<br/>
</li> </ul>
<div><i><b>Important Note: This short term funding drive is primarily to pay for the Nintendo Dev Kit and some initial costs. However, if we reach our goal, the campaign shall continue indefinitely as part of Indiegogo's In-Demand program. But it is urgent that we raise the initial funds in the time-frame requested.</b></i></div>
<div><i><b>Update: Anticipating that our funding campaign might not go through, I contacted Nintendo and let them know we are not going to be able to meet the November 14th extension deadline. I said that the best I could expect to do is to pay a portion of the invoice every 2 weeks unless our sources came through. They were very understanding and have agreed to let us pay every 2 weeks until it's paid off. So we are not dead in the water and this game will definitely see the light of day on the Wii U console. <span style=""background-color: initial;""><p style=""display: inline !important;"">That being said, we still want to push forward with getting this campaign funded. The more we can get toward the dev kit total, the faster we can make good on paying the invoice and getting back to focusing on making games. Please continue to spread the word on social media as we push forward.</p></span></b></i></div>

Pen & Paper RPG
...and throw in a little Skyrim
Scions of Chaos: Prologue is the first installment in a multi-chapter series of games to be released over the next few years. Each chapter is a complete stand-alone game, but with clear ties to an over-arching
story-line that spans time and genres. 


You are Princess Grais, a half-elf, the illegitimate child of the Queen of Fehrton. Thought to have died at the hands of bandits, you were given into the care of peasants in a local hunting village. There you grew to be a young woman with no knowledge of your royal lineage. When the King's agents discovered the truth of your whereabouts and of the Queen's infidelity, you were to be captured and executed. But the King's own champion, sworn to protect you, rescued you from the shadow of death. You must now embark on an epic quest to learn the truth of your heritage and the nature of your destiny. A great prophecy of doom hangs over the lands and you are a central player in the drama to unfold.

Pen & Paper ConceptsThe following concepts were inspired by traditional pen & paper (tabletop) role-playing gaming.
Search: Instead of having to physically search every square inch of an area, the player can initiate a skill-based search, which will reveal objects of interest in the immediate area by highlighting them. Depending on the character's skill level, the search can even reveal hidden or secret items such as secret doors.
Environment Clues: Things found in the environment can be essential for progressing in the game such as writing on a wall, an item on the ground, etc. For example, a quest could be triggered by simply finding a message scrawled on the wall that says ""Griffon Inn. Ask for Brayden."" 
Game master hints: Sometimes when someone is stuck when playing a P&P RPG, the GM may sense it and provide a little snippet of information to help the players progress. When GM hints are enabled, the player can opt to view one at any time. If a hint is available, the wise Game Master appears and gives the player some good advice on how best to proceed.
Simulated Sensory Perception (SSP): In a P&P RPG, players are often given detailed descriptions of an area or room when they first arrive. This is often embellished by the Game Master who can go so far as to tell the player what smells are in the air, the ambient temperature, or even how the place makes the character ""feel."" While a lot of this information is easily translated to the visuals that the player sees, there can still be a lot more information given to enrich the play experience. With SSP turned on, the player can see additional textual information when available that describes a place in more detail. Such information can also convey back story or historical facts about a place.




Scions of Chaos: Prologue is the first in a series of video game titles that span multiple genres. Prologue is a fantasy action/adventure RPG game with strong story elements and a firm foundation in pen & paper role-playing game traditions.



We at Magique Productions are passionate about making games and have a great desire to bring unique family friendly games to the PC and console gaming systems.



                          
My name is Thomas Scott. I'm the president and head game designer/programmer for Magique Productions, Ltd. I started programming games on the Commodore 64 back in 1984 and have been a fan of video games from the Atari 2600 era all the way up to present day. I'm an avid role-playing gamer and author of many role-playing game adventures. I've also written teleplays, having produced my own TV pilot that aired on local TV in Las Vegas, Nevada. By day, I've been a professional programmer for the past 25+ years. I've spent the last 13 years with a gaming company developing multimedia and game operating systems for video slot machines.
Scions of Chaos: Prologue is being developed on the Unity 5 game engine. We have spent that last year honing our skills on this platform and accumulating some of the best plugins and assets available. 



We find ourselves in a financial bind that threatens to halt our development on the Nintendo platform. Our invoice for the Nintendo Dev Kit was due on September 24th and, due to circumstances beyond our control, we were only able to pay about one-third of the total. We received an extension until November 14th, but find that we have not improved our financial situation. That is why we are reaching out to the gaming community for help to get us over this important hurdle and back on track.
Our first priority at this time is to get our Nintendo Dev Kit paid off and to help cover some of the development costs we've incurred thus far in regards to art and 3D content.  Here is the breakdown:  While we can't disclose the price of a Nintendo Dev kit, it is the first priority to get it paid off. Our deadline for paying for the kit was September 24th, 2015, but we've received an extension until November 14th, 2015. A portion of this funding goes immediately to paying off the dev kit. We've incurred some costs in purchasing art and 3D content as well as 3rd party tools and scripts for speeding up the development process. We've invested in some of the best Unity assets available for making professional games. Some of the money will go to cover the costs we've already incurred out of pocket.  If we don't reach our entire goal, all money will go towards payment of the Nintendo Dev Kit and we'll do whatever we can to come up with the difference.
If we should be so blessed to achieve funding beyond our development kit needs, all funds will go toward additional 3D content, music, and paying our development team for their efforts. If we see this escalate, I will update the campaign with additional stretch goals to match.
 
Important Note: This short term funding drive is primarily to pay for the Nintendo Dev Kit and some initial costs. However, if we reach our goal, the campaign shall continue indefinitely as part of Indiegogo's In-Demand program. But it is urgent that we raise the initial funds in the time-frame requested.
Update: Anticipating that our funding campaign might not go through, I contacted Nintendo and let them know we are not going to be able to meet the November 14th extension deadline. I said that the best I could expect to do is to pay a portion of the invoice every 2 weeks unless our sources came through. They were very understanding and have agreed to let us pay every 2 weeks until it's paid off. So we are not dead in the water and this game will definitely see the light of day on the Wii U console. That being said, we still want to push forward with getting this campaign funded. The more we can get toward the dev kit total, the faster we can make good on paying the invoice and getting back to focusing on making games. Please continue to spread the word on social media as we push forward.

With anything like this there are certainly risks involved. Games take time to develop and deadlines can be missed. Or the scope of the game can change. While we plan to do everything in our power to insure that Scions of Chaos: Prologue is completed and in your hands by end of 2016, we cannot guarantee the timing will work out. As everyone knows, even the biggest studios can have setbacks or changes in plans as we've seen with such games as the Legend of Zelda Wii U, Mighty No. 9, and others. 
To insure that we do our best in getting these games out the door and into your hands, we will use all available funds to bring on additional game developers to stay on track and improve the quality of the end product.

Let's face it. There just aren't many games of this type on the Wii U or even planned for the Wii U. This kind of game is sorely needed and can fill a huge void in the gaming library of a great Nintendo console.

Unity is also an excellent choice for small size studios and provide a great level of support and tooling to get the job done.



Composition

There is no restrictions on the tools our artist use to create the beautiful graphics of Paradise Island. Over the last years we have established a flow of using PSD for deliverables, and FBX produce by Maya or 3D Studio Max. There are many technologies involved for audio, particles and more. We look forward to answering any qusetions regarding this matter.

<p>Our project is a unique one. We 
are attempting to recreate a moment in history by pushing today's 
current technology to its limits. With advanced models, concepts, and a cutting edge 
game engine, we are virtually rebuilding the entire <em>RMS Titanic</em>, the world's most famous ill-fated ocean liner.</p>
<p>In
 our game, you'll be able to explore the ship inside and out. You can 
access every room, corridor, cabin, and pantry, with as much 
interactiveness as we can achieve. A tour mode is available where the 
player can simply explore everything at their leisure, but the main 
focus of the game is the story mode.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Beginning
 in the city of Southampton, England, which is being recreated on a large scale and with as much accuracy as our ship, the player is on the run from the
 police. He's accused of a terrible crime, but most importantly- he's 
innocent. He must pursue the true culprit, requiring the player to find a
 way onto the Titanic just before it departs.</span><br/></p>
<p>Playing
 through all five days of the voyage talking to passengers, gathering 
clues, and unraveling a grand mystery all while trying not to get 
discovered, the hero, Mr. Robert Morgan, has no idea that his whole 
world is about to change. When <em>Titanic</em> collides with an iceberg
 in the middle of the North Atlantic, the player must race the rising 
waters to complete the mystery, prove his innocence, and, most 
importantly.... survive.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_HThWAfmpE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">To give a quick summary, watch this video on our budget breakdown.</a><br/></p>
<p><strong>Team Expansion:</strong> <em>This represents the money needed
 to expand the team and hire new people, such as programmers, 
technicians, musicians, voice actors, and 2D artists.</em></p>
<p><strong>Team Compensation:</strong> <em>This
 is the cost needed for people currently included in the team, to cover 
the continued work and time needed to complete the project. This is also
 including core consultants, as well as additional modelers who are 
working on commission helping with characters, props, and other parts of
 the 1912 world.</em></p>
<p><strong>Hardware and Software:</strong> <em>This
 is any and all equipment we need to purchase, including additional 
computers, software licenses, motion capture materials, and sound 
equipment.</em></p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> <em>This is any kind of</em><em>
 cost that occurs on special occasions, but is no less necessary for the
 production. It includes travel for research and recording events, for 
sound materials, for possible studio sessions, and other special event 
purchases.</em></p>
<p><strong>Promotional and Legal:</strong>  <em>Licensing, rights, and contract </em><em>negotiations.
 The promotional costs include continuing to spread the word, completion
 fees, and also IndieGoGo perks to thank the donors.</em></p>
<p><strong>IndieGoGo Fees:</strong> <em>IndieGoGo
 charges us 9% until we reach our goal, then begins charging 4% after 
that, also refunding the difference between the 9% and 4% fees. <br/></em></p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Southampton and the Rest of the Project <br/>
</h4>
<p>Our goal is to not just complete the Titanic in its entirety, but a large chunk of the City of Southampton, England, as it appeared in 1912.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As our budget expands and 
increases, we will also be expanding the main part of the game, the 
Titanic elements, but with every additional $250,000 we receive, enough 
money will be put aside for us to expand out to the next numbered zone 
and include that in the game.</p>
<p>Work has already begun on the 
greenzone with progress having been done on nearly every street in it. 
It is all an early work-in-progress and obviously lacking textures, but 
samples are below.</p>

<p></p>
<p>This covers the costs needed right this moment, in addition to giving
 us enough to move forward in all possible directions, including 
beginning sound work, programming, and building the team.</p>This money allows us to complete the ship and tour mode, as well as hold our group out to find additional funding elsewhere. <br/><p></p>

<p>If we are able to achieve our vision through the support of our fans and contributors, we intend to revolutionize gaming. Just with the small fan-base we began with, we've seen opinions and biases fade. Many people see video games as a mindless pastime with no educational value and something only for the younger generations. Whether the stereotypes are true or not, the concept of this game goes beyond that. <br/></p>
<p>In the words of some of our more senior consultants, ""this isn't a game. This is an experience.""</p>

<p>It is our goal to include as many facts about the ship and her passengers and crew as we can. We intend for the player to be able to assume that if it was included in this game, it happened. We are searching and researching with an enormous amount of effort to find every last shred of evidence we can, including a large amount of unpublished documents and plans of the ship, to make sure the stories and ship designs we include are exactly as they appeared in 1912.</p>

<p>Never before has the historical maritime city had the opportunity to be recreated on such an authentic and in-depth level. We recognize this, and want to take the opportunity to give this city the preservation it deserves.

<p>We are going out of our way to make sure to include as many people as we can in the game, all based on real life people (with the exception of the main character and the villains). </p>
<p>As of now, the number of real-life Titanic passengers and crew in the game who you can talk to, interact with, and even 'stalk' during the sinking to watch their real-life actions is around 200. However, this number may increase or decrease as final production decisions are made, based on how successful our campaign is.<br/></p>
<p>We are also trying to include people who are lesser known, either because they never had the opportunity to write down their story, or because they were never focused on before by films. These people include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Some of the 113 Swedish Passengers on board, of whom 87 were lost</i></li>
<li><i>Masabumi Hosono, the only Japanese passenger</i></li>

</div></div>","Sail through history on board the ill-fated RMS Titanic, the largest 
moving object in the world in 1912, and a technological wonder of the 
time. As Titanic races through the icy waters of the North Atlantic, 
Robert Morgan battles the odds to clear his name of horrible crimes. 
When the brand new luxury liner strikes an iceberg, and threatens the 
lives of 2,200 souls, Morgan must race the rising waters and the clock 
as the ship sinks out from under him.

We are a small team of independent developers looking to make history by bringing it to life. We want to recreate the entire RMS Titanic, in full detail and authenticity, for the player to explore however they choose.







FREE ROAM MODE, where the player can wander around the ship, the docks, and the city of Southampton with no objectives, minimal crowds, and no time limits.

STORY MODE, where the player must live in the confines of 1912 society and work to clear his name of horrible crimes, for which the police are chasing him. In the end, as the vessel begins to sink in real-time, the player must work to finish his mission before it is too late.



Want to add a third dimension to Titanic? You'll be able to tour the ship and experience the grandeur of the great liner and the detail of our Titanic recreation using the Oculus Rift headset coupled with the power of Unreal Engine 4!In the finished game, you'll be able to explore every corner of the ship and take in the breathtaking beauty of Titanic in a rich virtual reality. Walk the narrow corridors to get a feeling for how cramped some of the spaces were on board, or stroll the promenades and wander the spacious public rooms of First Class to admire the craftsmanship of Edwardian shipbuilding and interior design at its best.You don't even have to wait to do that to some small extent. Check out this article to see what some have been doing with our FREE early environment demo and Oculus Rift, or just watch the video below to see it in action!

Our project is a unique one. We 
are attempting to recreate a moment in history by pushing today's 
current technology to its limits. With advanced models, concepts, and a cutting edge 
game engine, we are virtually rebuilding the entire RMS Titanic, the world's most famous ill-fated ocean liner.
In
 our game, you'll be able to explore the ship inside and out. You can 
access every room, corridor, cabin, and pantry, with as much 
interactiveness as we can achieve. A tour mode is available where the 
player can simply explore everything at their leisure, but the main 
focus of the game is the story mode.
Beginning
 in the city of Southampton, England, which is being recreated on a large scale and with as much accuracy as our ship, the player is on the run from the
 police. He's accused of a terrible crime, but most importantly- he's 
innocent. He must pursue the true culprit, requiring the player to find a
 way onto the Titanic just before it departs.
Playing
 through all five days of the voyage talking to passengers, gathering 
clues, and unraveling a grand mystery all while trying not to get 
discovered, the hero, Mr. Robert Morgan, has no idea that his whole 
world is about to change. When Titanic collides with an iceberg
 in the middle of the North Atlantic, the player must race the rising 
waters to complete the mystery, prove his innocence, and, most 
importantly.... survive.

   










To give a quick summary, watch this video on our budget breakdown.
Team Expansion: This represents the money needed
 to expand the team and hire new people, such as programmers, 
technicians, musicians, voice actors, and 2D artists.
Team Compensation: This
 is the cost needed for people currently included in the team, to cover 
the continued work and time needed to complete the project. This is also
 including core consultants, as well as additional modelers who are 
working on commission helping with characters, props, and other parts of
 the 1912 world.
Hardware and Software: This
 is any and all equipment we need to purchase, including additional 
computers, software licenses, motion capture materials, and sound 
equipment.
Situational: This is any kind of
 cost that occurs on special occasions, but is no less necessary for the
 production. It includes travel for research and recording events, for 
sound materials, for possible studio sessions, and other special event 
purchases.
Promotional and Legal:  Licensing, rights, and contract negotiations.
 The promotional costs include continuing to spread the word, completion
 fees, and also IndieGoGo perks to thank the donors.
IndieGoGo Fees: IndieGoGo
 charges us 9% until we reach our goal, then begins charging 4% after 
that, also refunding the difference between the 9% and 4% fees. 

Southampton and the Rest of the Project 

Our goal is to not just complete the Titanic in its entirety, but a large chunk of the City of Southampton, England, as it appeared in 1912.

As our budget expands and 
increases, we will also be expanding the main part of the game, the 
Titanic elements, but with every additional $250,000 we receive, enough 
money will be put aside for us to expand out to the next numbered zone 
and include that in the game.
Work has already begun on the 
greenzone with progress having been done on nearly every street in it. 
It is all an early work-in-progress and obviously lacking textures, but 
samples are below.








This covers the costs needed right this moment, in addition to giving
 us enough to move forward in all possible directions, including 
beginning sound work, programming, and building the team.This money allows us to complete the ship and tour mode, as well as hold our group out to find additional funding elsewhere. 




This
 is still not enough to get us through completion of our vision for the entire game, but allows us to work
 even harder for longer times, and lets us build more progress before 
needing to seek additional funding.

Allows for additional fund-raising events in the promotional category, such as dinners and other on-location events
This also allots for additional programmers to join the team






This is the lowest amount needed in order to bring us through completion, but the game will need to be trimmed back.

Includes minimum necessary team expansion to complete game
Allows for all needed hardware and software






This
 allows us to complete the game as we see fit, including most of the 
features we have our hearts set on, but will still require a slight bit 
of conservatism.

Additional programmers and team members
Covers completion, marketing, and distribution costs
May allow us to commission a Ken Marschall cover artwork






This
 allows us to comfortably complete the game, flush in everything we were
 possibly considering, and even see what other ideas can be included.

Full marketing and distribution
Game convention attendance
Possible expansion packs?
Live orchestra soundtrack?
Large team of professionals to guarantee quality



  

The Perks
To the right of the page, we're offering various thank-you prizes ranging from a simple credit on our page to being modeled into the game, meet-ups, and limited edition items. Please keep in mind that these are all 'thank-you' items, and not actual purchases. All perks include everything in the smaller perks as well, even perks that are in limited quantity.
To find out more about our perks, click here!
Other Things in ReturnIn addition to our perks, you will also be a part of something monumental. There has never been a recreation of a real-life subject like this, let alone something as poorly documented. You'll know that your contribution and support was a vital part in making this happen.Along the way, we will also continue to update our fans with behind-the-scenes videos, exciting screenshots, and historical vignettes educating those who are interested in fascinating stories and debates about history's most famous ship.






If we are able to achieve our vision through the support of our fans and contributors, we intend to revolutionize gaming. Just with the small fan-base we began with, we've seen opinions and biases fade. Many people see video games as a mindless pastime with no educational value and something only for the younger generations. Whether the stereotypes are true or not, the concept of this game goes beyond that. 
In the words of some of our more senior consultants, ""this isn't a game. This is an experience.""
This game will not only be exciting and entertaining, but will make history interesting and kindle the desire in many of today's youth to learn and research.





We intend for this game to also be an educational tool, with a special package designed for teachers and schools to educate their students on the Titanic and the 1912 time period. We are working with teachers and principals to develop a product that can be licensed to schools and youth groups to promote an exciting and engaging way of learning.






It is our goal to include as many facts about the ship and her passengers and crew as we can. We intend for the player to be able to assume that if it was included in this game, it happened. We are searching and researching with an enormous amount of effort to find every last shred of evidence we can, including a large amount of unpublished documents and plans of the ship, to make sure the stories and ship designs we include are exactly as they appeared in 1912.
We are also making our own discoveries in the ship, even 103 years after the disaster. We are finding rooms and areas that were actually always assumed to be one way, but in fact are different. We will be announcing these areas through in-depth documentary style videos over the course of the campaign. Stay tuned for our updates!

We recognize this, and want to take the opportunity to give this city the preservation it deserves. We really want to pay tribute to the city out of respect for the hundreds lost and the citizens today who still continue to preserve the memories of those lost on the ship.
If possible, we'd also like to see about recreating the shipyards of Belfast, parts of Cherbourg and Queenstown (now Cobh), and even the Piers of New York City.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Dude, where is my beer? is a satiric <strong>point-and-click adventure game</strong> about a guy who is desperately trying to find a pilsner in a world where people only care about craft beers.</p>
<p>In this game the protagonist has to talk to different characters, most of them bartenders, solve <strong>beer related puzzles</strong> at <strong>different stages of inebriation</strong> at locations like a sports bar, a microbrewery, a dive bar and a rock bar in his quest of finding an old school pilsner. Drinking beer is an integral part of the game experience and your BAC will open up or close off quest options and dialogue choices.</p>
<p>Among the puzzles you will have to win <strong>a brewing contest</strong> by finding all the necessary (and not only) ingredients to brew a rare beer, following a brewing recipe and I am sure you will fail a few times, before you brew it correctly.</p>
<p>With your help we can create an amazingly good-looking, humorous <strong>old school adventure game</strong> with fun puzzles and dialogues, and if it works, we can continue in the same direction and make more games like this one.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542226184/zbwsxelmluj7fom19p0a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After ten years in the IT industry, I decided to combine my love for old school adventure games with all the skills I can contribute and bring them together in one product, using creative writing, graphic design, 2D animation, programming and humor. In DWIMB I can use all of them, with some help from another graphic designer and a sound designer.</p>
<p>I am a <strong>professional 2D animator</strong> with ten years of experience from the IT, animation and web industry. My background gives me experience in all aspects of producing a project like DWIMB, including concept development, script, project management, graphic design, animation, interaction design, and programming. You can check out<strong> my animation portfolio</strong> here: <a href=""http://www.arik.no"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.arik.no</a></p>
<p>The project will feature all original artwork by illustrator <strong>Edo Brenes</strong>,  His unique style is sure to make the game look spectacular. You can check out his work at <a href=""http://www.edobrenes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.edobrenes.com</a> (He also made the illustrations above.)</p>

</div></div>","Summary
Dude, where is my beer? is a satiric point-and-click adventure game about a guy who is desperately trying to find a pilsner in a world where people only care about craft beers.
In this game the protagonist has to talk to different characters, most of them bartenders, solve beer related puzzles at different stages of inebriation at locations like a sports bar, a microbrewery, a dive bar and a rock bar in his quest of finding an old school pilsner. Drinking beer is an integral part of the game experience and your BAC will open up or close off quest options and dialogue choices.
Among the puzzles you will have to win a brewing contest by finding all the necessary (and not only) ingredients to brew a rare beer, following a brewing recipe and I am sure you will fail a few times, before you brew it correctly.
With your help we can create an amazingly good-looking, humorous old school adventure game with fun puzzles and dialogues, and if it works, we can continue in the same direction and make more games like this one.

After ten years in the IT industry, I decided to combine my love for old school adventure games with all the skills I can contribute and bring them together in one product, using creative writing, graphic design, 2D animation, programming and humor. In DWIMB I can use all of them, with some help from another graphic designer and a sound designer.
I am a professional 2D animator with ten years of experience from the IT, animation and web industry. My background gives me experience in all aspects of producing a project like DWIMB, including concept development, script, project management, graphic design, animation, interaction design, and programming. You can check out my animation portfolio here: www.arik.no
The project will feature all original artwork by illustrator Edo Brenes,  His unique style is sure to make the game look spectacular. You can check out his work at www.edobrenes.com (He also made the illustrations above.)
 

What We Need 

I am working on this game in my spare time and my original plan was to produce it all by myself, but as the project grew more ambitious, so did I. I decided to use a professional graphic designer with experience from these kind of projects, and when I found the one I knew would bring the game to a new level, I asked him for a quote. Therefore, almost all the funds from this crowdfunding are going forward to pay him for designing backgrounds, characters and all the items in the game, consecutively. Besides that we need funds to pay a sound designer and a composer to make the sound effects, a game theme and background music for the different locations in the game. The rest of the money will go to the voice actors to record all the dialogues and make the gaming experience even better.
Our goal is to make DWIMB available for the Steam platform on PC, Linux and Mac. We want to make the game interesting to people from different countries, and we are going to translate it to different languages. I speak English, Norwegian and Russian fluently and right now I am learning Spanish, so the translation would be neither expensive nor difficult to implement.

We are going to update the contributors and those who are interested in helping, by posting updates about the progress and showing the new graphic elements to prove that we are working hard and getting closer to the target!
 

Funding and Status       
We will finish the game no matter what. If we don't meet the goal, we will try to find other ways of getting the funds to pay for graphics and sounds. That might delay the whole development of the project, but it doesn't mean it will stop.
The storyboard and most of the programming is almost done. What still needs to be done is to create the graphics and implement them into the game, make the animations, improve some parts of the story, dialogues and puzzles and put the sound and the music at the end.

<p>In M.A.S.S. Builder, you’re free to create your own M.A.S.S. with everything you’ve collected. That’s right, you can put any kind of parts into each slot of your M.A.S.S. and create the perfect one that is up to your taste. We have classified each part of your M.A.S.S. into 4 main categories as of following:<br/><br/><u>Frames and Armors</u><br/>These are the main body of your M.A.S.S. They are the inner works where you'll be attaching and assembling parts of armors onto. After selecting your frame, you will then attach 'Armors' which are parts that will be attached onto a M.A.S.S. frame to cover them up. You are free to change each parts to suit your liking and create a customized look for your M.A.S.S.</p>

<p><u>Weapons</u><br/>Equipped with each M.A.S.S. are an array of weapons to deal with the Quarks. Each weapon will be separated into two parts that form a single weapon, so choose what you’d like to have. You can wield a total of one melee weapon, two ranged shooters, and two launcher option parts on your M.A.S.S. For more clarification, see below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Close Combat melee weapons allow selecting a grip to determine your stances and an assaulter part that determines the weapon’s damaging abilities.</li>
<li>Shooters are categorized into two types. You can select a trigger and barrel for both of them so you can customize them to shoot what you like.<ul>
<li>Bullet shooters are ranged weapons that fire physical bullets. These weapons have ammo counts but will continuously shoot until they run out of it aside from reloading. </li>
<li>Energy shooters are ranged weapons that fire energy bullets. These weapons do not have ammo counts, but will constantly need to recharge before being able to fire again. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Launchers are separated into bullet launchers and energy launchers as well. They attach to parts the M.A.S.S.’ body.<ul>
<li>Bullet launchers launch projectiles such as missiles or physical objects, they are extremely effective at their purpose but they are limited by ammo counts.</li>
<li>Energy launchers will use a large amount of energy from the M.A.S.S. to fire but they do not need to care about ammo counts.</li>

<p><strong>Ranged Combat:</strong> Ranged weapons allow you to select a trigger and barrel that customizes how you shoot and what you shoot at your enemies.</p>

<p><strong>Weapon Attachment:</strong> After setting up your weapons, you can bring a various of them into the battlefield but the more you bring, the more weight it takes and your balance with speed might be worse.</p>
<p>For everything that you decide to put onto the M.A.S.S. you only need to think about your M.A.S.S.’ weight. That’s the only downside of putting on too much armor and weapons as it will mostly slow you down in exchange of being more sturdy or more powerful. Then after creating the perfect look for your M.A.S.S. you can choose from a variety of combat enhancement 'gears' and 'operating system' to install into your M.A.S.S. These will determine the combat abilities you can wield, adjusting your speed, weight, and everything without having any effect on your appearance.The rest is up to your liking, we don’t want to limit your creativity in creating a M.A.S.S. you like to really use. Go wild!<br/> </p>

<p>While developing as a small team under other developers and publishers, we learnt about each other, growing to become more of a family than a team and gaining experience through our commissioned works. With strong bonds and some coincidences, we have separated and created a new entity that housed everyone from the team together under the same roof living together day and night.</p>

<p>Although we are a new company, the team has been working together on various games and assets for many publishers and developers to use in their own games. What we’ve worked on are products that have been distributed to the world in a manner or the other, and this is speaking from Thailand.The games that we’ve worked on includes MMORPGs, Mobile Games, Rhythm Mobile Games, even VR Games as well. Although we sounds funny and silly when we do things like this, our team leader is a very strict man that won’t allow errors or low-quality works to manifest in our games so we hope that you’ll put your trust in us.</p>

<ol><li>Why Indiegogo campaign?</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">The reason we’re using crowdfunding as a source of funding is because it’s a great method for us to secure some funds to further develop our framework into a game that we’d like to play. Since we’re doing that, we would like to invite other people to join us in the game, create something that we’d never thought of to create, and have fun with us, and the best way to do that is to let you guys chip in your support and feedback of the game with us so we can improve it while building.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">We’d also like to fully commit into game development, not going part-time, taking a few hours after our work to develop a game. No, we’d like to spend at least a third of a day to work on M.A.S.S. Builder and that requires you guys to help support us.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">This might be a question many of you are asking, and we’re ready to answer it. As we have mentioned above, we’re working full time on game development already and this is a project we’ve started as our liberation for a good while already as well.

<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Of course we’ll try to procure more funding in any other ways so that this project can be done as soon as possible and not later than we speculated in deliverance. So let me repeat this to you again, we will finish the game for every of our backers and fans.</p>
<ol><li value=""4"">What’s the business model?</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">M.A.S.S. Builder final product will be sold on steam as a purchase once, no subscription model. We’ll continue updating the game with free contents and patches but we’ll tell you honestly that there might be some DLCs available as well after sales and if there are great demands for the game.</p>
<ol><li value=""5"">Where can I find more information about M.A.S.S. Builder?</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">For now, we’ve got all existing information available on our social media (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VermillionDev/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/vermilliondev"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>) where you are free to send us a private message to talk about things, ask questions, and the likes of those.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>Regarding the perks that allow us to design stuffs, when are we getting to do it?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>A.</strong> For those perks, after the development of the alpha/beta finishes, we will contact you through your e-mail and start designing together with you on those stuffs. This process might take some time so we'll try to do it as soon as possible after we are complete but it should be at least the 2nd quarter of 2018. We'll update you with our builds and designs in our demo before that though so you can get a sense of what's to come and what's to be designed. Maybe faster if we can allocate more resources to that.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>How do we help you design those stuffs? How do I send my design in?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>A. </strong>You can either sketch us a design or find us a reference image for both of them. If you're into 3D modelling, we'll be more than happy for your model.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For armors, since they don't have status or anything, we'll take the image or model, sketch it out in our designs for our 3D artist to use, and have him create it.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For weapons, we'll have you break it into two parts, melee being the hilt and the edge, ranged being the trigger and the barrel, and launchers being the generator/ammo and the launchpad.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Hilts will state how they are held in stances, edges will be how it damages, triggers tell how the weapons are fired (burst? ammo type? stuffs like that) and barrels tells us how the projectile is activated (shoots double or a bullet at a time? maybe a gatling barrel?), and generators tells us what are shot (energy ball of heat, electric discharge?) while launchpad will tell us how each projectile behaves of firing (small pod of 4 or 8 like missiles or maybe a beam discharge?).</p>
<h3><strong>Risks in development, challenges to overcome</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, you’ve read it this far and want to know how risky this project is. First things, game development takes time to create a very immersive and fun experience for our players. To this point, we all know there are various games that takes forever to be released, or folded projects since there’s not enough money. We’ve already finished designing mechanics and core gameplay features, cutting down one of the most time-consuming workload already so all that’s left is to start the development.</p>
<h3><strong>Spreading the word</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks for reading until this point, if you liked the project or at least what you’ve just read, please tell your friends, your foes, whoever you’d like to! Just spreading the word about our project is a great help in realizing our game, our dreams, and bring it to life. We’re extremely grateful for the opportunity and support that you gave us.</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
</div></div>","UpdatesPlease have a try of our customization prototype demo v3!  http://www.indiedb.com/games/mass-builder/downloads/mass-builder-prototype-demo-v3 
updated with the following:
- New armor set for a better preview of our customization system
- More weapons for customization
- A small preview into the combat system through our improved training grounds
- Added melee combat for testing
- Changed and improved particle effects and optimization
- Changed and improved some animation styles






The World: The world after its collapse from being invaded. Countries are abolished and humanity is forced into shelters (a total of 13 around the world). Terrains are deformed as a result of wars and red zones that humanity should never enter are established.
 


In M.A.S.S. Builder, you’re free to create your own M.A.S.S. with everything you’ve collected. That’s right, you can put any kind of parts into each slot of your M.A.S.S. and create the perfect one that is up to your taste. We have classified each part of your M.A.S.S. into 4 main categories as of following:Frames and ArmorsThese are the main body of your M.A.S.S. They are the inner works where you'll be attaching and assembling parts of armors onto. After selecting your frame, you will then attach 'Armors' which are parts that will be attached onto a M.A.S.S. frame to cover them up. You are free to change each parts to suit your liking and create a customized look for your M.A.S.S.


Joint Adjustment: Frame joints' length can be adjusted in most cases to create the perfect looks for your armors.

Armor Assemble: Attaching armor onto a frame.

Joint Armor Expand: Armor pieces that are attached on joints will be resized in accordance to frame joints.





Armors: Armors can be fully mixed and matched up to your liking. Above is a preview of the two styles we have created.

Paint: Each armor will have around 2-4 sub-elements where you can select a paint style for each element separately.When you edit those styles, every part using it will be changed as well.

Decal: Decals can be attached onto each armor piece and you can adjust its size, color, position, designs, and etc. as you like.
WeaponsEquipped with each M.A.S.S. are an array of weapons to deal with the Quarks. Each weapon will be separated into two parts that form a single weapon, so choose what you’d like to have. You can wield a total of one melee weapon, two ranged shooters, and two launcher option parts on your M.A.S.S. For more clarification, see below.

Close Combat melee weapons allow selecting a grip to determine your stances and an assaulter part that determines the weapon’s damaging abilities.
Shooters are categorized into two types. You can select a trigger and barrel for both of them so you can customize them to shoot what you like.
Bullet shooters are ranged weapons that fire physical bullets. These weapons have ammo counts but will continuously shoot until they run out of it aside from reloading. 
Energy shooters are ranged weapons that fire energy bullets. These weapons do not have ammo counts, but will constantly need to recharge before being able to fire again. 


Launchers are separated into bullet launchers and energy launchers as well. They attach to parts the M.A.S.S.’ body.
Bullet launchers launch projectiles such as missiles or physical objects, they are extremely effective at their purpose but they are limited by ammo counts.
Energy launchers will use a large amount of energy from the M.A.S.S. to fire but they do not need to care about ammo counts.




Close Combat: Melee weapons allow selecting a grip to determine your stances and an assaulter part that determines the weapon’s damaging abilities.

Ranged Combat: Ranged weapons allow you to select a trigger and barrel that customizes how you shoot and what you shoot at your enemies.

Weapon Stances: Each weapon has its own attacking stances and their variation of combination of attacks.

Weapon Attachment: After setting up your weapons, you can bring a various of them into the battlefield but the more you bring, the more weight it takes and your balance with speed might be worse.
For everything that you decide to put onto the M.A.S.S. you only need to think about your M.A.S.S.’ weight. That’s the only downside of putting on too much armor and weapons as it will mostly slow you down in exchange of being more sturdy or more powerful. Then after creating the perfect look for your M.A.S.S. you can choose from a variety of combat enhancement 'gears' and 'operating system' to install into your M.A.S.S. These will determine the combat abilities you can wield, adjusting your speed, weight, and everything without having any effect on your appearance.The rest is up to your liking, we don’t want to limit your creativity in creating a M.A.S.S. you like to really use. Go wild! 

Fighting against you in these missions will be alien lifeforms, not the grotesque one but cool looking ones like these. Most of them are not that strong but beware they come in great numbers and you’ll be overwhelmed if you’re not careful.
Sometimes, you’ll also face an extremely strong opponent, be it a commanding alien or some other mercenaries. Please take care of them for the safety of Earth as well.

 

After finally finishing the last detail in your creation and finalizing your M.A.S.S, you will take on various missions around the world. 
You will be launched and deployed from your hangar straight into battle after briefing and from there, complete your mission in a fast-paced action-filled battlefield, using your optimized arsenal of weaponry.

Mission Dialogue: Throughout missions, you will encounter NPC dialogues on important progress or information that needs to be relayed.

Movement: There are various methods to traverse the missions quickly in the game. Using boosters are one of them.

Melee Combat: Prototype motion of frame movement and melee combat effects. Melee combats will have a strong effect against enemies.

Ranged Combat: Prototype motion of frame movement and ranged combat aiming effects. Sample of plasma weapon with large area of destruction. There are various other customization with your weapons such as explosive or freezing shots.


 



 

While developing as a small team under other developers and publishers, we learnt about each other, growing to become more of a family than a team and gaining experience through our commissioned works. With strong bonds and some coincidences, we have separated and created a new entity that housed everyone from the team together under the same roof living together day and night.

Although we are a new company, the team has been working together on various games and assets for many publishers and developers to use in their own games. What we’ve worked on are products that have been distributed to the world in a manner or the other, and this is speaking from Thailand.The games that we’ve worked on includes MMORPGs, Mobile Games, Rhythm Mobile Games, even VR Games as well. Although we sounds funny and silly when we do things like this, our team leader is a very strict man that won’t allow errors or low-quality works to manifest in our games so we hope that you’ll put your trust in us.
 

For the supporter options, here are both versions of the digital poster. You may choose one. The rest of the tiers will get both colors.

 


 








 

Why Indiegogo campaign?
The reason we’re using crowdfunding as a source of funding is because it’s a great method for us to secure some funds to further develop our framework into a game that we’d like to play. Since we’re doing that, we would like to invite other people to join us in the game, create something that we’d never thought of to create, and have fun with us, and the best way to do that is to let you guys chip in your support and feedback of the game with us so we can improve it while building.
We’d also like to fully commit into game development, not going part-time, taking a few hours after our work to develop a game. No, we’d like to spend at least a third of a day to work on M.A.S.S. Builder and that requires you guys to help support us.
Why $40,000?
Alright, let’s get this straight to the point. Our team is working full time on game development as you are reading this right now, but it's a game commissioned by someone else. We would like to instead, create, work on, and play what we'd seen as truly our game.
With this amount of money, we’ll be able to survive to finish the game within the specified timeframe (with the standards of living and how we live) while also being able to procure what is needed for the completion of the game.
For clarity, we'll breakdown the $40,000 for you to see how they goes into each part of our development process.


(40%) Arts and assets: Due to M.A.S.S. Builder being a very customizeable experience, we'd like to create lots and lots of variants of armors and weapons for our players.
(30%) Programming: There's lots to programming, creating databases to fulfill each parts of the game, utilizing particles, enemy AI programming, etc.
(10%) Sound: Voice overs from professional talents and composers to create the soundtrack for the game.
(5%) Content Design: Creating contents to create a world that feels ""real"" in its own sense with story writing and the settings.
(10%) Game Design: Creating additional mechanics that create the ""fun"" factor in gameplay and balancing numbers in ""building.""
(5%) QA: Quality assurance can help us get rid of possible factor of ""unfun"" and bugs before the project is released.

Why flexible funding?
This might be a question many of you are asking, and we’re ready to answer it. As we have mentioned above, we’re working full time on game development already and this is a project we’ve started as our liberation for a good while already as well. So for any amount of money that we receive, you can be sure that we’ll finish the game eventually, just not in the time frame that we’ve stated. 
Of course we’ll try to procure more funding in any other ways so that this project can be done as soon as possible and not later than we speculated in deliverance. So let me repeat this to you again, we will finish the game for every of our backers and fans.
What’s the business model?
M.A.S.S. Builder final product will be sold on steam as a purchase once, no subscription model. We’ll continue updating the game with free contents and patches but we’ll tell you honestly that there might be some DLCs available as well after sales and if there are great demands for the game.
Where can I find more information about M.A.S.S. Builder?
For now, we’ve got all existing information available on our social media (Facebook, Twitter) where you are free to send us a private message to talk about things, ask questions, and the likes of those.
Q. Regarding the perks that allow us to design stuffs, when are we getting to do it?
A. For those perks, after the development of the alpha/beta finishes, we will contact you through your e-mail and start designing together with you on those stuffs. This process might take some time so we'll try to do it as soon as possible after we are complete but it should be at least the 2nd quarter of 2018. We'll update you with our builds and designs in our demo before that though so you can get a sense of what's to come and what's to be designed. Maybe faster if we can allocate more resources to that.
Q. How do we help you design those stuffs? How do I send my design in?
A. You can either sketch us a design or find us a reference image for both of them. If you're into 3D modelling, we'll be more than happy for your model.
For armors, since they don't have status or anything, we'll take the image or model, sketch it out in our designs for our 3D artist to use, and have him create it.
For weapons, we'll have you break it into two parts, melee being the hilt and the edge, ranged being the trigger and the barrel, and launchers being the generator/ammo and the launchpad.
Hilts will state how they are held in stances, edges will be how it damages, triggers tell how the weapons are fired (burst? ammo type? stuffs like that) and barrels tells us how the projectile is activated (shoots double or a bullet at a time? maybe a gatling barrel?), and generators tells us what are shot (energy ball of heat, electric discharge?) while launchpad will tell us how each projectile behaves of firing (small pod of 4 or 8 like missiles or maybe a beam discharge?).
Risks in development, challenges to overcome
Okay, you’ve read it this far and want to know how risky this project is. First things, game development takes time to create a very immersive and fun experience for our players. To this point, we all know there are various games that takes forever to be released, or folded projects since there’s not enough money. We’ve already finished designing mechanics and core gameplay features, cutting down one of the most time-consuming workload already so all that’s left is to start the development.
Spreading the word
Thanks for reading until this point, if you liked the project or at least what you’ve just read, please tell your friends, your foes, whoever you’d like to! Just spreading the word about our project is a great help in realizing our game, our dreams, and bring it to life. We’re extremely grateful for the opportunity and support that you gave us.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I had always wanted to make video games from a young age, to the point that I would make drawings of game idea's and give them to the people at Blockbuster, thinking that they could get them to someone to be made.</p>
<p>It was silly but I was a kid. I didn't know any better. Later on in life, I got the writers bug and wrote a 500k word novel in around 3 weeks. I never went anywhere with it but it was something I was and still am proud of to this day.</p>
<p>When I discovered visual novels, I was amazed at how well crafted these stories could be. They contained beautiful artwork, well designed characters, interesting stories and moving dialogue.</p>
<p>I was hooked.</p>
<p>It was at this point that I decided that I would take all of my years tinkering with game engines and the stories I had rattling around in my head to finally create something worth while.</p>
<p>And so, I contacted an artist I was introduced to years ago and got him sketching characters for me and I was amazed at how well he captured the way I envisioned them!</p>
<p>More time passed and I really started cracking down on writing the story. Most of it is still in my head and is slowly flowing onto the page, though. I currently sit at around 30k words and I'm only three acts into the story!</p>
<p>My goal is to have a long, detailed and interesting story with several different endings available to the readers.</p>
<p>I suppose you'd like to have an idea as to what the story is all about?</p>
<p>""Broken Reflections follows the protagonist, a student who has suffered from depression their entire life, who has been sent to a school that specializes in students with illnesses and traumatic pasts.</p>

<p>They are all different and, in that sense, they are all the same.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>This Is Where You Come In!</h3>
<p>What I need is simple. I need enough initial funding to get this thing off the ground and gears moving before I can present the world with something worthy of full funding.</p>
<p>To do that, I need money for character and background art, the soundtrack and special effects for cinematic scenes.</p>
<p>If I can reach the full, $5000 goal, it will give me plenty to work with for what I have planned at the end of the year.</p>

<h3>Why This Is Important to Me and Maybe Even You</h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>    I am a Computer Science graduate, and I have always had an interest in video games and creating a world in which you can become a part of a larger experience. I have developed a number of projects to various degrees of complexity, but this campaign is important to me in order to further my skill and press forward with creating more content. I would like to be able to better share my work with others, get feedback from a community, and gain support from those who can share in my enjoyment.</p>
<p>Space Bunnies is a survival adventure game in which you explore different planets and systems and practice diplomacy with various alien species. This started out as a small project, but with strong positive feedback I have chosen to expand it. I hope to continue to have the opportunity to share my creations, and with them, a small piece of joy in how I see this world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>    Thus far, I have created a solid prototype for movement and interaction within the space system and individual planets as well as an outline for numerous other systems and content that I would like to add. This project will only be a three month span for further developing a framework for a combat system.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline: </strong>3 Months (January 1st-March 31st)</p>
<p>Develop a Playable Demo</p>
<p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Planet Interaction</p>
<p>    Week 1: Character movement (rotation vs planet rotation)</p>
<p>    Week 2: Character Interaction</p>
<p>    Week 3: Enemy Tracking</p>

</div></div>","Summary
    I am a Computer Science graduate, and I have always had an interest in video games and creating a world in which you can become a part of a larger experience. I have developed a number of projects to various degrees of complexity, but this campaign is important to me in order to further my skill and press forward with creating more content. I would like to be able to better share my work with others, get feedback from a community, and gain support from those who can share in my enjoyment.
Space Bunnies is a survival adventure game in which you explore different planets and systems and practice diplomacy with various alien species. This started out as a small project, but with strong positive feedback I have chosen to expand it. I hope to continue to have the opportunity to share my creations, and with them, a small piece of joy in how I see this world.

The Goal
    Thus far, I have created a solid prototype for movement and interaction within the space system and individual planets as well as an outline for numerous other systems and content that I would like to add. This project will only be a three month span for further developing a framework for a combat system.
Timeline: 3 Months (January 1st-March 31st)
Develop a Playable Demo
Month 1: Planet Interaction
    Week 1: Character movement (rotation vs planet rotation)
    Week 2: Character Interaction
    Week 3: Enemy Tracking
    Week 4: Enemy Attacking
Month 2: Game Progression Mechanics
    Week 1: In-Game UI and menu
    Week 2: NPC interaction
    Week 3: Event Generation
    Week 4: Save/Load Data
Month 3: Space Combat
    Week 1: Shoot with ship (Different types of firing)
    Week 2: Ship stats
    Week 3: Enemy AI (shooting and defending)
    Week 4: Enemy AI (tracking and evading)
Month 4: End of Project
    Week 1: Clean up
    Week 2: Release Demo
    Week 3+: Evaluate future of project
Every two weeks I will write a review on any progress I am able to make to update any followers I may have. At the end of the project, I will publicly provide an executable demo.

The Impact
    Feedback is extremely important to me, and highly valuable to my progress. If you would like to see this project completed, please share your support. If you have an opinion or would like to be involved, please let me know. Your positive feedback will depend on whether I will be developing Space Bunnies further, or whether I will be entering other directions.

Risks & Challenges
   Time - I have limited time and energy. I have developed a timeline to make my goals clear so I can set my pace and have motivation to continue onward. With each two week period I can determine whether I have met my goals, and decide on whether my timeline may need revised.
   Delays - If I can not meet my goals in time, I may revise my timeline and create a new estimate for when I can fully complete my goal.
   Technology - For as much as I believe I have encountered every issue I possibly could, there are always unforseen obstacles that I will encounter. I may have to revise my solution for an instance of this project as necessary to create a functional product.

<b>This game <i>utilizes all the contemporary behaviors we know </i>to move a person toward positive physical and mental health. </b>Many people are worried about their mental and physical health.

Either parents feel they are a bad influence or that a kid is just wasting time that could be better used elsewhere. A lot of adults are indulging in gaming these days too.

What I'm working on, is a fun game where you can lift your spirits as you identify with a depressed character, an avatar you design, who practices and internalizes positive thoughts, feelings and experiences! 

This is a game you can play on a mobile app or on the web. These activities will be equally funny, healthy and appropriate for the young and old. This isn't just for the clinically depressed, we all feel down sometimes. There are 38 million sufferers of depression in America alone. You may know or love someone who feels down, slow and sluggish, suffers from low self esteem, anxiety and/or depression like I do, or know what it's like to have the winter or Monday blues.

What activities will you see in this game?


There are 6 main steps that the world of psychology suggests a person follows for combating depression and anxiety: 


Visit a therapist or a support group
Express feelings with family and friends whenever possible
Try to remain mentally active at work or a job
Exercise daily if health permits
Have a nutritious diet with ample fluids

Learn meditation, yoga or stress relieving exercises 


These steps will be taken by your character in fun exercises that set him up for rewards, consisting of visible improved health, and both coins for a gift shop, and to purchase fun experiences. Just as you can earn these things in real life, you can also earn them in this game. 

In the game, there will be activities based on behaviors that deepen optimism and social connections, behaviors that make positive changes in our lives, enforcing our belief that our behavior really matters. For example, making it a regular practice to write thank you notes and share them, mental activity games designed around nutrition, a few minutes of low impact cardio or practicing meditation. Some of these simple exercises have scientifically proven in studies to create more optimistic, calm and happy people.  These are just some of the activities you will find in this fun, awesome game.

</div></div>","Putting the “Shooting” in “Troubleshooting”This October, enter the PC as antivirus software and fight against an unending cyber menace!  We’re bringing old-school shooters to the next generation and adding a Rogue-like mode to the mix for the most tenacious shooter fans!Deeply inspired by early FPS legends and their fast-paced run-and-gun gameplay, ""Infinite Recursion"" seeks to recapture the feeling of impending Doom that makes players Quake with fear as they navigate uncharted levels filled to the brim with merciless foes.Early FPS levels might start out uncharted, but they can only stay that way for so long.  After a while, traversing the same abandoned facilities or hellish pits becomes second nature, and the need to rely on instinct is replaced by the ability to learn every surprise the levels hold.  To keep the experience perpetually fresh, ""Infinite Recursion"" uses procedural generation to make every level uniquely treacherous, so keeping your wits about you never becomes outdated.Story Told Through Gameplay: Years ago, the only way to tell a story in a video game was through gameplay.  Exposition and world-building and mission objectives would all have to be conveyed without the use of cutscenes and long speeches, leading to an experience that felt like one big adventure.  This is how “Infinite Recursion” will tell its story.  Minimal dialogue, minimal cutscenes, and minimal interruption.  It’s your adventure -- your story -- from beginning to end.Fast-Paced Action: “Infinite Recursion” takes us back to when a shooter was a run-and-gun adrenaline rush filled with enemies and bullets and a distinct lack of mercy on both ends.  We’re not saying a slow and methodical cutscene-filled morality-questioning modern shooter is a bad thing; all we’re saying is that sometimes, it’s nice to just play a game.Weapons: It wouldn’t be an FPS without tons of weapons ranging from “lethal” to “more lethal”, and we’ve gone all-out in designing some pretty swell “more lethal” weapons to call our very own.  Do you like lava?  How about lightning?  How does shooting them from a gun sound?  The answer is “Magnificent.”Story-Mode: The story of “Infinite Recursion” takes place in a personal computer.  You take on the role of Vanguard Version 4.5, the newest antivirus software on the market, who has just been installed to hunt down and delete malicious software, but viruses aren’t the only enemies you’ll find waiting for you.  Outdated programs and crazed hackers wreak havoc throughout the system, and something even more nefarious lurks toward the end of your journey. In this mode, there is a set number of levels and bosses, tied together with checkpoints and a minimalist, gameplay-centric narrative.Infinite-Mode: Infinite-Mode pits the player against an unending labyrinth of viruses and hackers with far more variety than Story-Mode can offer with its finite levels.  As the true test of players’ tenacity and skill, Infinite-Mode also removes all checkpoints, giving the player only one chance to get the farthest they can before their demise.  How long will your software last before becoming obsolete?Power-Ups: Throughout levels, 4.5 can find upgrades to boost skills, such as his speed, health, and fire-rate.  These upgrades are scattered on every floor, so be sure to check each room thoroughly if you find yourself wanting for an edge.Alternate Characters: 4.5 “Ninja” is the latest and fastest antivirus program in the system, but he isn’t the only one.  By playing through ""Infinite Recursion"", you’ll unlock different characters to use in Infinite-Mode, each with their own unique starting traits and play-styles.  Which one will you make it farthest with?Licenses are expensive, but they’re necessary to build and distribute the final version of our game.  We’ve come so far with our development, but we can’t finish by ourselves.  As a start-up company, we can’t afford these licenses.  That’s why we need you.  With your support, we’re not just a start-up company.  We’re a community of gamers that remembers the thrill of classic shooters and wants to see it again, and it’s that community that can see our very first project through to completion.Our game is meant to reawaken the nostalgia deep within older gamers while showing the younger generation the golden age of the FPS.  This comes with the inherent risk of trying to stay true to the titans we’re honoring while also adding a few new features to appeal to a new era.  Keeping this balance between loyalty and originality is no easy task, but with community feedback and testing, it is well within reach.“Infinite Recursion” is well on its way to completion, but what if we told you 100% was just the beginning?  If we get more funding than our campaign requires, we’ll be able to start putting the extra pledges toward extra content.  The original game is meant to be a single-player experience on the PC, but it could be so much more if you give us your support!Before you pledge, you’re probably thinking to yourself, “What’s in it for me?”  Well, we’ve got you covered with a plethora of neat perks, some of which are limited in stock and exclusive to the IndieGoGo campaign.Special Backer Credit - $5You were generous enough to give us your time and money, and as such, you deserve a special place in the credits as a backer!Digital Copy of the Game - $10You’ll get a code to download the full digital version of “Infinite Recursion” for the PC upon release, plus you still get backer credit!Digital Soundtrack - $15You’ll get a code to download the full “Infinite Recursion” soundtrack in digital form upon release, plus all previous rewards!Digital Artbook - $20You’ll get a code to download the “Infinite Recursion” artbook, containing everything from early concept to finished designs for characters and worlds, plus all previous rewards!Early Access Beta - $25You’ll get a code to download the Beta version of “Infinite Recursion” while we work on final updates and changes before the game’s official launch, plus you get all the previous rewards, too!Virus Invasion Screensaver - $35If you’ve never noticed viruses infecting your computer due to the power of your antivirus program (or the sneakiness of the viruses), then you’ll enjoy this System CorRuptivity Electronic EmulatioN and SimulAtion Via Enhanced Reality (SCREENSAVER, for short), which will let you experience a [totally fictional] invasion of viruses right on your computer screen!  Not to mention you still get all the previous rewards.SIGNED & LIMITED Poster - $50Have yourself a big ol’ wall-hugging picture to remember your generosity by!  We’ve only got so many of these, so get them while they’re still here.  This is the first of the physical perks, but it still comes with all the previous rewards!""Infinite Recursion"" Poster - $50Don’t worry if you missed the limited signed poster.  You can still get yourself a big ol’ standard wall-hugging picture to remember your generosity by!  It still comes with all the previous rewards that aren’t signed and limited, so no worries!SIGNED & LIMITED Game - $60     You’ll be mailed a signed physical copy of “Infinite Recursion” for the PC upon release, plus you’ll still get all the previous rewards!Physical Game - $60     We might be out of signed copies, but you can still be mailed a standard physical disc copy of “Infinite Recursion” for the PC upon release, plus you’ll still get all the previous rewards (not including SIGNED & LIMITED items)!Physical Soundtrack - $75     You’ll be mailed a physical disc copy of the “Infinite Recursion” soundtrack upon release, in addition to all previous rewards (not including SIGNED & LIMITED items)!SIGNED & LIMITED Game and Tee - $100    You’ll be mailed an “Infinite Recursion” T-shirt, and instead of the regular physical copy of the game, you’ll be mailed a signed physical copy of “Infinite Recursion” for the PC upon release, plus you’ll still get all the previous rewards (not including other SIGNED & LIMITED items or other physical game copies)!

This is the financial break-up for the initial $25,000 we're asking for:Any funding beyond the first $25,000 goes toward our stretch goals.Money means nothing without people who want to share our vision.  The more people we can reach, the bigger our following can become and the farther our vision can spread, so if you think old-school shooters still have a place in the modern era, be sure to share our campaign on social media (by clicking the links below), and anywhere else you can think of.  We won’t forget all your help!We’d also love to be featured on the number one PC gaming platform, so show your support for us on Steam Greenlight!",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

For example you decide to play only with music theme word pack and perform only by singing and the whole game gets to a completely new level.

After pressing the word you have chosen, you have 5 seconds supported by the sound alert to get ready for your performace. If you need to check the word, you can use the slider. In the game mode screen there are also two buttons, a <b>red one</b>, which you press when you fail or break any rule, and a <b>green one</b> for being successful. Both being successful or unsuccessful means it’s the other team’s turn and everything repeats. <b>After each round players in one team switch</b> (the one who was guessing in the last round, will perform in the next round etc.).

Everything has been already said, all drinks were drunk, all pubs were closed at the time and we wanted to do something. Accidentally we had no games to play, but all of us had a smartphones. Even after some research <b>I couldn’t find any playable game </b>and I realized I could make one…  About year and a half passed by when I finaly had some time to work on the game (on the bus, on the train, at boring classes in school) creating<b> hundreds and hundreds of words to guess</b>.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431193115/dbojee00bgvtjsttgf10.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>After some time a friend of mine introduced me <b>Jan Šíma</b>, who was excited by the idea so we decided to cooperate.

When you connect to the Internet it will upload your results and download results from other devices and that will form sets of words <b>from the easiest to the hardest ones</b> to guess.

<h3>6) Goals on Indiegogo</h3>
<p>We have some plans with our game and some of them are quite BIG :) And we would like to move quicker with your help, so here are few promises...</p>
<p><b>If we reach our goal of $1000</b></p>
<p>We are planning to release Android version till the end of February and iOS till the end of February for iPads and during spring for iPhones.</p>
<p><b>If we reach $1500</b></p>
<p>We will add some other languages according to your comments and wishes.</p>
<p><b>If we receive more than $2000</b></p>
<p>We will translate the game into much more languages! :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>7) Thanks</h3>
<div>Thank you very very much if you decide to contribute or if you just had enough energy to get here at the end. There might be (and probably are) some mistakes in English and we are sorry for that. But all the English and other languages in the game has been revised twice by native speakers so that should be much better.</div>

</div></div>","1) WhatWhat is it all about?We are working on a new fun game, which should make people laugh at parties. The game is a “board game” in your pockets. Unlike typical board games it has a lot more options. It allows up to four teams of players on one device (min. 4 players = 2 teams). In the game one member of the team always performs a word (by pantomime, singing, drawing or description) and his/her playmate(s) tries to guess it.  The game was made in reaction to a lack of good party games played on one device. Its one and only goal is to make people laugh.Thanks to various settings and packs of words you are able to play the game exactly according to your wishes. For example you decide to play only with music theme word pack and perform only by singing and the whole game gets to a completely new level. Or you can choose only movie pack and perfom by pantomiming some famous movie scenes.The game can also represent perfectly practical and useful tool for learning foreign languages. Players can choose different language settings for menu and for words in the game. We already have the game in English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Polish, Czech and Slovak and hopefully there will be more languages in the future. It’s also great for children with word packs aimed at them.  1.1) The main features:•  Many words, it will take a long time to go through all of it•  You can play with two, three or four teams (unlimited number of team members)•  Pantomime, drawing, singing and description of various words•  Intuitive and simple to play•  Can be used as a practical tool to improve foreign language•  Many languages (EN, DE, FR, RU, ES, PL, CZ, SK)  2) How to play this game (RULES)The game is for 2, 3 or 4 teams (min. 2 players for a team). The number of players in one team isn’t limited, but two players are recommended.Game fields have 4 colors which determine how the word must be “performed” (= type of game). Red fields mean pantomime, blue ones description by giving a definition of the word, green ones drawing and yellow ones singing.If you need any help during the game, use the help button (""i""), we hope you will find your answer.There could be more hands on one device which could cause incorrect/accidental touches, if this happen use the return button in the right top corner of the screen.Before every game you set the number of teams and their colors, the time limit for guessing the right word, and the number of game fields. In the next two steps you can also choose which packs of words you want to activate and what types of game you want to play. At the beginning of every game all teams are on the start field. First team presses the “PLAY“ button and chooses one of the words from the list. Every word has a different number which tells you how many fields you will move forward if you guess it correctly. After pressing the word you have chosen, you have 5 seconds supported by the sound alert to get ready for your performace. If you need to check the word, you can use the slider. In the game mode screen there are also two buttons, a red one, which you press when you fail or break any rule, and a green one for being successful. Both being successful or unsuccessful means it’s the other team’s turn and everything repeats. After each round players in one team switch (the one who was guessing in the last round, will perform in the next round etc.). This will continue until the first team gets to the end. Then you can choose whether you want to let other teams finish the game, repeat the same game or exit to the menu.(Word) description means that you can talk during the time limit, give definitions of the word and try to guide your playmate(s) to guess the right word. You can’t use the root of the given word.Singing doesn’t necessarily mean you have to sing or hum a real song or a melody; you simply have to try to sing the definition of the word you would use in an ordinary description.Pantomime is about using your own body in an attempt to help your playmate guess the word.For drawing you must have a paper and a pencil. It’s not allowed to write any letters, you can only draw. 3) How and why we are working on this gameOnce upon a time I was sitting with my flatmates in the living room. Everything has been already said, all drinks were drunk, all pubs were closed at the time and we wanted to do something. Accidentally we had no games to play, but all of us had a smartphones. Even after some research I couldn’t find any playable game and I realized I could make one…  About year and a half passed by when I finaly had some time to work on the game (on the bus, on the train, at boring classes in school) creating hundreds and hundreds of words to guess.  After some time a friend of mine introduced me Jan Šíma, who was excited by the idea so we decided to cooperate. I am responsible for all the graphics, all the text (not at all for the translation) and promo. Jan is programing Android and iOS version.  It was a long journey to get to this point where we are right before the finishing line. There are thousands of words in 8 languages, about 10 pages of text in 8 languages each and third version of graphic which should be very easy to operate on bigger screens of tablets and also smaller screens of smartphones. 4) Reasonable questionsSo why are we asking for funding when it‘s almost done?The more players are involved the better the game gets (for the reason scroll down).We want to attract as many players as possible and with a little help from you we can create some ads, which we can’t afford at this point. Also we want to find the answer for the most important question – Is there enough players interested in this type of game? We try to make no compromises and make it truly the best game for multiple player on one devices. So please, give it a try… :)  Also we have to pay the rent, food, drinks and we expect to work 3 months full time now only on our game to finish it and to provide some basic support and fix bugs. To be able do it as good as we want it to be done we need some help with funding.Why more players mean better game?We wanted the game to adjust the level of difficulty so every time you guess any word and you either fail or succeed the game will remember it. When you connect to the Internet it will upload your results and download results from other devices and that will form sets of words from the easiest to the hardest ones to guess. It means that the words which move you one field forward should be much easier than the ones which move you four fields forward (this function going to be launch later next year (2017)). 5) Funding and other ways to help

7) Thanks
Thank you very very much if you decide to contribute or if you just had enough energy to get here at the end. There might be (and probably are) some mistakes in English and we are sorry for that. But all the English and other languages in the game has been revised twice by native speakers so that should be much better.

Thanks one more time, and hopefully - Have fun with our game! :)

EYUC2011 Wroclaw, Poland - 11 place OPEN


WJUC2012 Dublin, Ireland - 11 place OPEN, 11th place Women


EYUC2013 Cologne, Germany 12 place - Open, 14th place - women


WJUC2014 Lecco, Italy - 22 place OPEN, 7 place WOMEN


      Over the past year the ruble against the euro has fallen dramatically, making trips to international tournaments for the Russian teams are much more expensive. This is particularly felt by students and pupils who have not yet earned money and are forced to ask their parents.
      This year the participation of  Russian Juniors Teams in EYUC-U19 is really insure because of the high cost of the trip.

Team fee = 1000 Euro 
Player fee = 50 Euro (x20 players in each team)      We had 3 potential teams but eventually because of money we have only women U19, and even this team will reach up EYUC  only if we collect the money to pay their fees. Our Federation of Flying Disc have no opportunity to pay for any team.

   We ask to help only to juniors. All the coaches will pay for themselves because we are adults and we have a job in addition to which we have voluntary engaged with Juniors Ultimate.

<p>The story begins in the city of Dropp, cornerstone of a universe that freely mingles the <strong>Western</strong> and <strong>Fantasy</strong> genres, to create a Weird-West setting where classic 19<sup>th</sup>-century elements of the Old West blend with modern technology.</p>
<p>In the middle of a deserted wasteland, features of the past meet modernity in a mixture of sand, wood, electricity and machinery, providing a unique environment for the game.</p>
<p>The city is built online and set in specific <strong>Locations</strong> hosted on the <i>Social Network</i> platforms and on the <i>Official Site</i>. Each Location has its own function and dedicated contents, and is usually managed by a <strong>Main Character</strong>.</p>
<p>The world structure and narrative form are based on the principles of transmedia storytelling, where different media contribute to the development of the story, creating a richer and more engaging user experience.</p>
<p>To visit and interact with a specific Location, the user will simply have to go the platform hosting it:</p>

<p>The once flourishing city of Dropp now lies in ruins, after a terrible earthquake triggered a series of catastrophic events that put it down on its knees.</p>
<p>Only a few areas and buildings are left standing in the city, and that is where the user, who will in all respects become one of its <strong>citizens</strong>, will start living his own adventure, in a world in constant evolution!</p>

<p>Sons of Dropp is a universe characterized by amazing and engaging <strong>narrative, audio and visual contents</strong>.</p>
<p>The story proceeds through <strong>animations, illustrations, storytelling</strong> and many other assets that make the project unique.</p>
<p>So far, we have been financing the project through personal investment and a small grant by the Lazio Regional Council, which allowed us to cover some of the costs related to the collaborators, the creation of the main narrative structure, the design of the firsts concept arts and the prototyping of the website.</p>
<p>Thanks to that grant – which has been entirely used up – Sons of Dropp could still be launched and run, even we do not reach the target amount here, but it will have to be done with a quality and quantity of contents inferior to our goals.</p>
<p>To offer the experience that we have in mind, we need support of everyone and that is why your contribution here on Indiegogo is essential to us.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo campaign will entirely be dedicated to the development and the enrichment, in terms of quality and quantity, of the narrative, visual and audio contents that will define the gaming environment.</p>
<p>If we reach our funding objective we will be able to expand the frames of secondary storylines and side quests, realize higher-quality articulated animations, create concept arts for each situation and event we propose, enrich the whole project with details that will make it a captivating and engaging experience.</p>
<p>Sons of Dropp will be free, though we do not exclude a pay-to-play version that will guarantee the access to exclusive contents and to the making-of.</p>
<p>The city of Dropp needs you for its revival!</p>
<p>It also needs you to share the initiative and spread the word as much as you can.</p>
<p>So do not hesitate to subscribe to the channels of the project: once Sons of Dropp is launched, they will all form part of the SOD experience!</p>

<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLANGE</strong></p>
<p>The most risky task will be to keep the contents and the platforms together, in order to create the pulsating and vibrant world we have in mind.</p>
<p>Developing a story strongly defined by visual contents that allows user interaction and has within it role play elements, is expensive and complex. We need a clear and at the same time flexible programming, which allows us to shape the story also on the basis of user participation.</p>
<p>The obstacles during the development of the project will be linked to the structure we have in mind. This is why we are working to create a game system which is simple and intriguing at the same time.</p>
<p>For us, the challenge has already begun, so are you ready to become the Sons of Dropp?</p>

Sons of Dropp is a new concept of interactive online story that merges the principles of Role Playing with those of transmedia narration.
A constantly evolving virtual world which can be explored by navigating freely on the official website and Social Network platforms connected to it.
Immerse yourself into the setting, interact in real time with characters, join quests, earn experience points and influence the storyline with your choices.
In Sons of Dropp the story is not yet defined and much of his course depends on you too.
Available late 2018
 

The story begins in the city of Dropp, cornerstone of a universe that freely mingles the Western and Fantasy genres, to create a Weird-West setting where classic 19th-century elements of the Old West blend with modern technology.
In the middle of a deserted wasteland, features of the past meet modernity in a mixture of sand, wood, electricity and machinery, providing a unique environment for the game.
The city is built online and set in specific Locations hosted on the Social Network platforms and on the Official Site. Each Location has its own function and dedicated contents, and is usually managed by a Main Character.
The world structure and narrative form are based on the principles of transmedia storytelling, where different media contribute to the development of the story, creating a richer and more engaging user experience.
To visit and interact with a specific Location, the user will simply have to go the platform hosting it:

The once flourishing city of Dropp now lies in ruins, after a terrible earthquake triggered a series of catastrophic events that put it down on its knees.
Only a few areas and buildings are left standing in the city, and that is where the user, who will in all respects become one of its citizens, will start living his own adventure, in a world in constant evolution!

EVery Location will have its function and content. here you could find Quest to join, main characters opinion about the story events and more detail about the narration. 
The Last Dropp Inn, where  you can drink the excellent Mesaz of the rough innkeeper Boris Malgor and the Street, guarded by the mysterious Stranger will be hosted respectively on Facebook and Twitter.

The Public Library, managed by the wise librarian Judith Sandoval and the Construction Yard, a symbol of rebirth, directed by the brilliant engineer Majr Zonza, can be visited on the official website of Sons of Dropp.


Also the Kamizu Shrine, where the deity Kamizu is worshipped, will be hosted on the official site.

Is very important to note that characters will be ""run"" by real people! So dialogues will be 100% spontaneous!
 


Narration and Interaction will be organized as follow:

The Main Story is narrated through Animated Episodes, that generate small ""Narrative Arcs"".
The length of each narrative arc will vary, but their average duration in the real world will be of about 1 month.
Within each narrative arc, a system of Quests, Missions and Random Events will help the users/citizens deepen their understanding of the narrative universe and interact with it through:
Quests linked to the primary storyline (and thus with the events narrated in the animated episodes);
Side Quests that can trigger smaller and secondary storylines;
Natural or Random Events that can affect the city and will require the participation of a number of citizens to be addressed;
Missions proposed by Characters.


Upon the completion of all Main Quests linked to an animated episode, the next episode will start, giving way to a new narrative arc that will allow the story to continue.


The virtual narrative world continues to exist and evolve, even when the users are not online, thanks to the authors running it behind the curtain.
Sons of Dropp is set up as a ""persistent world"", in which Time plays an innovative role: even if you decide to stay out of the action for a day, important events may still occur and you could be thrown into an ongoing cataclysm or an enemy invasion on your next visit.
If that happens, you can still catch up on the story by viewing the animated episodes, that will always be accessible, or by going through the Summary Section on the website.

In some cases, the behaviour of the community may influence and change the course of events. Secondary storylines can actually generate situations where the community inputs and decisions will determine the outcome of an issue.

In the image above:


A. Quest ask citizens to get rid of infected in a specific area in the city.

B. After this, a new Quest will begin, asking to remove corpses all around to avoid a new infection. In this case, a minimum number of users have to join and succeed the quest.

C. If the number of users IS NOT REACHED, the quest is failed and the infection starts again, even worst than before.

D. In the other case, the problem is solved and order restored. For the moment...


It is important to understand that this is not a videogame you’ll be looking at, nor an online game or a browser game. It is a new and different experience that has, as we have said, a compelling story.
The user interface on the site will therefore be reduced to a minimum, to give us the opportunity to elastically manage and elaborate the story and the events narrated, ensuring a varied and engaging interaction.
The official website will perform the following important functions:​
- It will be a connection to the whole narrative universe. In the homepage there will be a map that will indicate which locations are reachable in the present moment. A section that will summarize all the narrative events will also be available.

- It will manage the points and equipment system. In the profile created on the site will be collected all information about the ""status"" of the citizen: experience points acquired, equipment unlocked, current level.

- It will host some locations. In the Public Library section, for example, you can access archive of the city (Game Bible) where you will find all the information on the elements that make up the narrative universe, or you can find out if the librarian has some Quests to propose.


The Quests and Missions System represents the way in which citizens will be called to action.
The setting will be as follows:

The types of Quest will be different:
CREATIVE QUESTS: they present an opening narration and ask the citizen to write his actions describing how he would deal with the proposed situation. The more creative and consistent with the opening narration the descriptions will be, the more chance you have to beat the Quest.

EQUIPMENT QUESTS: in the next paragraph we will explain how it will be possible to unlock equipment that will allow the citizen to participate in this type of Quest.

It foresees initially hidden equipment.
The colors of the equipment icons indicate the type of equipment required.
The citizen must choose between the equipment he has already unlocked, commenting on the Quest with the elements he considers necessary to deal with the situation.
It is mandatory to comment with a number of items equal to the number of the hidden ones.
When the Quest concludes, the requirements are published and the citizens who have guessed them pass the Quest.

Quest at its launch:
Quest resolved:

Note: The opening narration of the Quest provides valuable information about the necessary equipment.
If the description suggests, for example, to act in silence, there is a good chance that the required weapon is not a firearm but a silent weapon!
MULTIPLE ANSWER QUESTS: data una situazione bisognerà scegliere l'azione reputata più giusta tra quelle proposte  
OTHER TYPOLOGIES which we will reveal further ahead​
Not all the Quests will be available by browsing the site only. It may happen that they are issued in one of the locations hosted by social networks, which is why we recommend exploring the entire ""universe"".

The days in Dropp will run in parallel to the real-world days and it will be up to the citizens to decide when, how and how much they want to participate in the adventure in order to feel satisfied, knowing that the main story will still be following the natural course of events.
 



NOTE: Perk starting from VIP CITIZEN on include ""Chronicles of Dropp volume"", that will be ready in the first half of 2019. For these perks, we can ship a digital version of every other object in October 2018, and then ship every physical object when the volume will be ready.

Sons of Dropp is a universe characterized by amazing and engaging narrative, audio and visual contents.
The story proceeds through animations, illustrations, storytelling and many other assets that make the project unique.
So far, we have been financing the project through personal investment and a small grant by the Lazio Regional Council, which allowed us to cover some of the costs related to the collaborators, the creation of the main narrative structure, the design of the firsts concept arts and the prototyping of the website.
Thanks to that grant – which has been entirely used up – Sons of Dropp could still be launched and run, even we do not reach the target amount here, but it will have to be done with a quality and quantity of contents inferior to our goals.
To offer the experience that we have in mind, we need support of everyone and that is why your contribution here on Indiegogo is essential to us.
The Indiegogo campaign will entirely be dedicated to the development and the enrichment, in terms of quality and quantity, of the narrative, visual and audio contents that will define the gaming environment.
If we reach our funding objective we will be able to expand the frames of secondary storylines and side quests, realize higher-quality articulated animations, create concept arts for each situation and event we propose, enrich the whole project with details that will make it a captivating and engaging experience.
Sons of Dropp will be free, though we do not exclude a pay-to-play version that will guarantee the access to exclusive contents and to the making-of.
The city of Dropp needs you for its revival!
It also needs you to share the initiative and spread the word as much as you can.
So do not hesitate to subscribe to the channels of the project: once Sons of Dropp is launched, they will all form part of the SOD experience!

RISKS AND CHALLANGE
The most risky task will be to keep the contents and the platforms together, in order to create the pulsating and vibrant world we have in mind.
Developing a story strongly defined by visual contents that allows user interaction and has within it role play elements, is expensive and complex. We need a clear and at the same time flexible programming, which allows us to shape the story also on the basis of user participation.
The obstacles during the development of the project will be linked to the structure we have in mind. This is why we are working to create a game system which is simple and intriguing at the same time.
For us, the challenge has already begun, so are you ready to become the Sons of Dropp?",36.0,0,"1 Campaign
