<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Safe |X Camp Project consists of visual representation of Circa Survive songs (from the Inuit Sessions, to Violent Waves and B-Side tracks). I will be leaving stencil paintings on various mediums (wood panelings, wheatpastes, doors, ETC), with the following: <br/><br/>                                             CIRCA |X SURVIVE<br/>                                        THE SHRINE EXPO HALL</p>
<p>                                                        LA, CA</p>
<p>                                                       12.28.13</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each piece will be posted on various social media sites (Facebook &amp; Instagram for example) with the title of the song being represented.</p>
<p>The plan is to start leaving these out all throughout Orange County, CA, and make my way closer and closer to the Shrine Expo Hall (which will host Circa Survive's last show of 2013). <br/><br/>The visual depictions will get bigger and bigger until the final installation finale which will be discussed further when details begin to unfold. Regardless of you being a California resident or a Circa Survive fan, there are plenty of ways to get involved and be part of one of the greatest shows of the year.<br/><br/>This will all take place on the day of the show (December 28th, 2013). I will be in the LA area bright and early, putting up all the pieces throughout the city (ANY HELP IN THIS WILL BE EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL SO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HELPING OUT WITH THROUGHOUT THE DAY, PLEASE SEND ME AN EMAIL SO I CAN ADD YOU TO THE ""CIRCONIAN LIST"" : ERIKELIOTHEREDIA@GMAIL.COM</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even if you're not a fan of Circa Survive, you can always support indie artists/art culture. There is so much good art that had a tendency of being under-appreciated each day, that I felt the need to contribute to the rise of an up-and-coming movement.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you do not feel like contributing money, you can always just follow the trend of oral tradition by spreading the link of The Safe Camp Project Indiegogo site. Any potential referral is a good word-of-mouth on my end, so please feel free to spread the word through all of your social networking favorites.</p>

We have been making two dimensional and three dimensional pixel art out of Perler beads for over 6 years now. We take your favorite video game characters, anime characters, or really any image you want and make it in to art work that you can use for a number of decorative uses. We strive every day to make the American dream come true. We struggle to own and run our own business even during this financially difficult time! Just like everyone else though, our costs have gone up and we are doing everything we can to not transfer these one-time fees to our customers.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">By contributing to our fundraiser today you will be helping us build our company’s ability to offer newer and better products. We want to buy a smaller bead called mini Hama beads, so that we can make our work more detailed yet still a manageable size and price.

</table><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We have an excellent track record as a business. We have nearly always made back what it costs us to go to a convention. Though the prices for a lot of different parts cost us more every event. That is why we need to expand our business. This fundraiser is good for us, the people who own this business, to help us to finance our business without risking our personal homes and families. The money will help, on a miniscule level, the economy in Michigan, and in the United States.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Every little bit counts even if it's $1!

We appreciate any little bit!</p></div>","Hello! This company, Ravenfox Studios LLC, is a small Michigan based art studio. We have been making two dimensional and three dimensional pixel art out of Perler beads for over 6 years now. We take your favorite video game characters, anime characters, or really any image you want and make it in to art work that you can use for a number of decorative uses. We strive every day to make the American dream come true. We struggle to own and run our own business even during this financially difficult time! Just like everyone else though, our costs have gone up and we are doing everything we can to not transfer these one-time fees to our customers.
By contributing to our fundraiser today you will be helping us build our company’s ability to offer newer and better products. We want to buy a smaller bead called mini Hama beads, so that we can make our work more detailed yet still a manageable size and price. Also these beads would allow us to offer the same images we already offer in a variety of new products such as key chains, jewelry, or accessories of many types.
Your donations today would also allow us to continue to take personal commissions at our tables. Many of the conventions or art shows that we sell our pieces at charge us for the electricity needed to run our computers and our iron. Some conventions will charge us over $400 in one weekend.

We have estimated that we need $2000 seed money to help to improve this business. Right now we're starting small trying to raise money for our battery! For every donation you will receive a gift!

<p><strong>Quo Vadis Blog  8/7/12<br/></strong></p>
<p>"" ...a smart and stylish alternative to what we get at Staples. In an era where personalization is key, why not clips!. I love my ""KD"" clips - it makes the document mine in a unique way.""<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Inkophile - Pen &amp; Ink Blog  8/3/12 </strong></p>
<p>""Regular paper clips lack any air of style. Supra Clips leaves the ordinary clip by the wayside.“</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About This Project</strong><br/><br/>Over time, there has been little innovation in the field of paper clips and staples. <br/>In August 2011, The Wall Street Journal, published an article asking:<br/><strong><em>Can You Build A Better Paper Clip?</em></strong><br/><br/>We have.</p>
<p>Supra Clips represent an advancement over traditional staples and paper clips <br/>by incorporating personalized design with superior function. They not only hold <br/>papers together…they capture attention and enhance document presentation by <br/>elegantly securing papers in perfect alignment. Our American made product is <br/>also environmentally friendly. Manufactured in aluminum. Reusable and recyclable.</p>
<p>We wanted to develop a paper clip that allowed people to distinguish themselves. <br/>We now offer a variety of designs, colors and monograms for social and business <br/>applications.</p>
<p><img alt=""20120629070350-1_-_demo_bars"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/304910/primary_pictures/original/20120629070350-1_-_demo_bars.jpg?1340978666"" id=""project_pitchmedia_primary_picture_image"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p><strong>Introduction &amp; Why We Seek Your Support</strong></p>
<p>My husband Kelly and I have developed Supra Clip. They are also known as Classic Clips. We introduced the Supra Clip brand for this Indiegogo event. This limited time promotion offers product at great discount. Goods will ship in early September shortly after funding occurs.</p>
<p>We design clips ourselves and own proprietary rights to product. However, we are presently dependent upon a contract manufacturer here in the US to make product for us.</p>
<p>Our project goal is to move from contract manufacturing to in-house manufacturing. With successful Indiegogo support we will be able to purchase press equipment to begin making clips ourselves. </p>
<p>Your support is very important. Therefore, we are offering Indiegogo perks at deep discount. We have sufficient gold coil stock to make your Perks. </p>
<p>We also have all embossing die-sets made for designs shown. Once funding happens, we will immediately purchase the press equipment. </p>
<p>We should be setup within two weeks. If for any reason there is a delay, our contract manufacturer will still be in place. Again, our goal is to ship product soon after funding. Bottom line we are properly organized to make and ship your Rewards/Perks.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Funds</strong></p>
<p><strong>What your $18,000 contribution will do. </strong></p>
<p>$15,000 - Purchase of a used press, feeder and coil unwinder</p>
<p>$750 Perks - Coil material costs</p>
<p>$950 Perks - Packaging materials and postage costs</p>
<p>$1,300 - Indiegogo administration costs</p>
<p>Any additional funding will be used to purchase better equipment !</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

"" ...a smart and stylish alternative to what we get at Staples. In an era where personalization is key, why not clips!. I love my ""KD"" clips - it makes the document mine in a unique way.""
Inkophile - Pen & Ink Blog  8/3/12 
""Regular paper clips lack any air of style. Supra Clips leaves the ordinary clip by the wayside.“
 
About This ProjectOver time, there has been little innovation in the field of paper clips and staples. In August 2011, The Wall Street Journal, published an article asking:Can You Build A Better Paper Clip?We have.
Supra Clips represent an advancement over traditional staples and paper clips by incorporating personalized design with superior function. They not only hold papers together…they capture attention and enhance document presentation by elegantly securing papers in perfect alignment. Our American made product is also environmentally friendly. Manufactured in aluminum. Reusable and recyclable.
We wanted to develop a paper clip that allowed people to distinguish themselves. We now offer a variety of designs, colors and monograms for social and business applications.

Introduction & Why We Seek Your Support
My husband Kelly and I have developed Supra Clip. They are also known as Classic Clips. We introduced the Supra Clip brand for this Indiegogo event. This limited time promotion offers product at great discount. Goods will ship in early September shortly after funding occurs.
We design clips ourselves and own proprietary rights to product. However, we are presently dependent upon a contract manufacturer here in the US to make product for us.
Our project goal is to move from contract manufacturing to in-house manufacturing. With successful Indiegogo support we will be able to purchase press equipment to begin making clips ourselves. 
Your support is very important. Therefore, we are offering Indiegogo perks at deep discount. We have sufficient gold coil stock to make your Perks. 
We also have all embossing die-sets made for designs shown. Once funding happens, we will immediately purchase the press equipment. 
We should be setup within two weeks. If for any reason there is a delay, our contract manufacturer will still be in place. Again, our goal is to ship product soon after funding. Bottom line we are properly organized to make and ship your Rewards/Perks.
Use of Funds
What your $18,000 contribution will do. 
$15,000 - Purchase of a used press, feeder and coil unwinder
$750 Perks - Coil material costs
$950 Perks - Packaging materials and postage costs
$1,300 - Indiegogo administration costs
Any additional funding will be used to purchase better equipment !

<h3>What is the Violet Protest?</h3>
<p>Developed and organized by Arizona-based artist, educator and social practitioner, Ann Morton, the <i><strong>Violet Protest </strong></i>is a nation-wide public engagement project that employs hand-made textiles as tools for protest against political divisiveness, and instead, generates a creative call for national unity.</p>
<p>Focused on values we hold dear, rather than specific political or social issues, the color <i>Violet</i> symbolizes the literal combination of red and blue, familiar symbols of our nation’s differing ideologies.</p>
<p>Thousands of makers from across all 50 states, DC and Canada have contributed 8 x 8-inch squares using a variety of textile processes. Each square, created with equal parts red and blue, sends an individual message supporting the core values of the <i>Violet Protest</i>.</p>
<p>Core values of the <i>Violet Protest</i>:<br/>• Respect for the other   • Citizenship   • Compromise   • Courage   • Candor  <br/>• Country over party and corporate influence   • Compassion   • Creativity</p>
<p>As of July 2021, the <i>Violet Protest</i> has over 2200 makers signed up to make nearly 17,000 individual squares, representing almost 75,000 hours of hand labor.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626987043/o7yariqxbhb2gelzmuux.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we need your support?</h3>
<p>The project goal is to send bundles of between 25-50 of these individual squares to each member of the 117<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">th </span>US Congress in late 2021/early 2022 as a unique demonstration of protest, and to voice our hopes and support for cooperation between lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In support of the thousands of <i>Violet Protesters,</i> and to achieve our ultimate mission of affecting hearts and minds, we want the impact to be strong when these bundles arrive in Washington DC.</p>
<p>In addition to the unique collection of textile squares of all techniques and textures, we will be including letters and photos from multiple makers and overview materials about <i>Violet Protest</i> in each package.</p>
<p>We are also working with Arizona State University to be a part of an event at their program facility in Washington DC to gain presence and visibility. We are reaching out to PR and media outlets to create a buzz around the <i>Violet Protest’s</i> arrival in DC. We have a team of tenacious, well connected advocates working on behalf of the <i>Violet Protest</i>. And although we hope to hand deliver some of these packages directly to lawmaker’s offices, the majority of these packages will be sent via USPS.</p>
<p>To print, package and pay for postage, our estimated budget to send 535 individual packages totals approx. $12,000.00. In addition, there are travel and rental costs associated with the sorting and packaging operation, and to facilitate our presence in Washington DC coinciding with the delivery of these packages of squares to Congress. All these efforts need funding, and that is why we are launching this campaign.</p>

<p>The <i>Violet Protest</i> has been on exhibit at Phoenix Art Museum since March 10, and will be up until September 5, 2021. The exhibit opened with approximately 9500 squares on display, with new squares being added each week. Now totaling about 11,000 squares, it is projected that the gallery will hold nearly 17,000 squares by the closing of the exhibition!</p>
<p>Artist, Ann Morton, has spent several days each week in the gallery, knitting to underscore the extraordinary outpouring of hand labor by all the Violet Protesters. Nearly every time she is present, she encounters visitors that are stunned and even moved to tears upon experiencing the <i>Violet Protest</i> face to face. The power within this exhibition is palpable. </p>
<p>With the launch of this project being in January 2020, before any of us knew what the year ahead would bring, makers have stepped up and participated throughout the challenging events of 2020. This project has been a lifeline for many during these dark days. It has given makers a way to be creative, and be a part of this movement that has become an increasingly important outlet through which to voice their resistance to the growing and threatening divisions within our US democracy. Delivering these tens of thousands of squares to Congress has been our singular goal because we believe that this is a truly unique expression that can touch the hearts and minds of our lawmakers.</p>

<h3>Meaningful Visions...</h3>
<p>When I was 3 years old, in the north west of Australia, my mother drew me a stick figure, and I thought it was the most magical thing in the world! Over the years that sense of wonder has only grown, just as the language that evokes that wonder has kept evolving. Stick figures at some point became realistic illusions. And realistic illusions soon became meaningful visions.</p>
<p>The poetic and meaningful vision, transmitted in a song of oil, is what I live for; it is the secret I have to give the world. 'The Secrets of Pangaea' is my most ambitious project to date. It has been conceived as a series of large scale paintings, drawings and prints. Already underway I plan to complete the series during a 3 month apprenticeship with the renowned painter, Odd Nerdrum, in Norway, between August and October of this year.</p>
<p>'The Secrets of Pangaea' comes off the back of two successful solo exhibitions of mostly single figure paintings, since moving to Ireland. These were 'The Antique Gaze' (2015) and 'Guardians of Solitude' (2016). The Antique Gaze marked my first foray into Baroque-inspired figurative painting (previously my work had been very modernist). 'The Secrets of Pangaea' marks another shift, this time from single figure portraiture to multi-figure narrative painting. This is a bit like a writer shifting from the short story to the novel, and my chief inspiration, in making this move, has been the Norwegian master Odd Nerdrum. It is an amazing privilege, therefore to be studying with him this year. But I need your help to get me there!</p>

<p>I decided to launch this campaign as a shared opportunity: pre-sales and patronage will give me the time and resources I need for the Nerdrum apprenticeship (including travel and living expenses) - and time and materials to complete the series. It will greatly alleviate the financial pressure which builds to a crescendo between exhibitions (I live off sales and private teaching). In alleviating such pressure it will allow me to produce a higher quality presentation, in terms of materials (both in quantity and quality), in the production of limited edition lithographs (to be created and printed at Cork Printmakers),  and in the production of a high quality catalogue to complement the exhibition.</p>
<p>Conversely it is an an opportunity for the art lover, friend and supporter to contribute towards the series' creation. Purchasing a work of art is for many of us, a little out of reach. This is an opportunity to show your appreciation and support without necessarily making an expensive purchase. Catalogues, classes, prints, seminars and prize draws all come in at under €50! For the collector and patron it is an opportunity to join the journey from the works' earliest conception, to the point of  realisation and acquisition. The Secrets of Pangaea can live on in your home as paintings, drawings and prints! In between the two, if you would love to be a collector, but can't quite manage it, I'm offering a third option: co-owning a work with other community collectors. But, hang on, how would that work? Read on!</p>
<h3>Community Acquisition Fund: 'Clon Art Share'</h3>
<p>Sometimes I see a painting, print or sculpture at a show, and would love to buy it, but I just don't have the funds. If I had the option to co-own the piece, however, say for a 10% share, that perhaps I could afford! This has got me thinking about the possibility of a community art share fund, and I'd like to try it out in Clonakilty, where I live, through this campaign (you could start something similar where-ever you are!). So I am offering a community sharehold option of €85. Community shareholders will meet as a group at a preview event to The Pangaea exhibition, and decide as a group on a purchase and negotiate a community space for it to be shown in. Shareholders will each receive a certificate stating their sharehold value and the title of the work. It will be up to the group to decide rules of on-sale and exchange, however it is my hope that it could be the beginnings of a permanent community collection. Community lovers, are you game? Let's begin the revolution!</p>

<h3>Prize Draws</h3>
<p>Everyone who pledges will go into a prize draw! EVERYONE! There are three prize draws: the first for an A4 'gilcee' colour print of one of my paintings (this is a high quality reproduction on fine art paper), the second for a limited edition lithograph of one of the Pangaea drawings (hand printed at Cork Printmakers using a special photo-litho technique), and the third for an original Pangaea drawing. How lucky are you feeling? One special perk - the Raw Sienna Supporter - has entry into all three draws!!!</p>
<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>There are four class options available, from 2 hour sketching sessions to a six week course. There are options for those wanting to explore recreationally ('Summer Creators), for beginners and more advanced painters. There is also an option to join me in Paris in Summer 2018 for a gallery tour and drawing tuition! Come and join the fray!</p>

<h3>Baroque Wanderers Soiree</h3>
<p>Cheese and wine in hand, allow me to take you into the world of the 'Old Masters', into the time of Rembrandt and Carravaggio - then hold on as we accelerate into the Now, into the world of the 'New Baroque', a painterly world defined by the likes of Odd Nerdrum, Nicola Samori and Agostino Arrivabene. They are contemporary masters who are reviving the very soul of painting and this a chance for me to introduce you to their work!</p>
<p>This will be an intimate, informative and sensory evening. Wine, nibbles and refreshments will be provided, as well as my Guardians and Pangaea catalogues. And, of course a night of the Baroque would not be complete without the timeless airs of award-winning composer Justin Grounds, who will regale us with his Baroque violin.</p>
<p>To add a little more spice there will be an exclusive soiree prize draw with several lithographs and giclee prints up for grabs!</p>
<h3>Lithographs &amp; Drawings</h3>
<p>Lithography is a beautiful form of printmaking, and photo-lithography an exquisite way of reproducing drawings. And this is what I plan to do for the Pangaea series. The process, technical support and facilities, however are not cheap, and this is one of the reasons for running this campaign. With pre-orders and pledges I can make this happen, providing a richer smorgasboard (yet more affordable acquisition) for your eyes.</p>

<p><i>'Song of Pangaea', 100x100cm, charcoal and pastel on paper, 2017. Available for reservation by deposit. To be shown this November. €700 (unframed).</i></p>
<p>Drawing plays a vital role for me in developing compositions for paintings, and they become wonderful works in their own right. A suite of the Pangaea drawings will be shown in late 2017 as part of the collection. If you place a 'collector' deposit through this campaign I will email you images as they emerge and will give you an invitation to a special preview event, giving you first options for acquisition.</p>
<h3>Collectors and Patrons</h3>
<p>Works are still available from my previous two collections and may be viewed on my website: jameswaller.org. The 'Collector' and 'Patron' options allow you to place a deposit for artwork which you can then choose from existing available work, or which you can commission, or which you can choose from the Pangaea series as it becomes available. Collectors and Patrons will be emailed images as they come to light and be invited to a special preview event, to see the work first hand and have first options on acquisition. A note, as well on size: there will be a good mix of small, medium and large paintings in the collection, and prices will range from €250-€550 (smallest), €550-€950 (small-medium), €950-€1400 (medium-large), €1400-€9000 (large-epic). Drawings will be between €250 and €750 (not including frame).</p>

<p>This is a treasure to keep for a life time. The Child Portrait Package comes in at €550. It is for a 60x40cm oil painting on linen, and includes a preparatory drawing, catalogues and prize draw entry. I can work from a photograph that you provide or we can organize a photo session.</p>

<h3>Secrets of Pangaea Catalogue</h3>
<p>Producing a high quality exhibition catalogue is a significant way to increase visibility and presence and provides a valuable aid in pitching to galleries, collectors and markets further afield. It is, however, something I can only contemplate through pre-sales, and is another reason for this campaign. I was only able to produce a catalogue of my last show after it was over, and then only in a small number. Your pledge will enable The Secrets of Pangaea to be far better presented and in time for the show! And, of course, you will receive the catalogue!</p>

<h3>Crunching the Numbers!</h3>
<p>By now you'll have an inkling of what's involved: a three month apprenticeship, flights, travel, living expenses, material expenses - including oils and mediums, timber for frames, linen, paper<strong> -  </strong>printmaking  expenses, including studio membership, paper, ink and technical guidance - studio rental, catalogue and printing costs. And most of all, time.  It all stacks up. Sales from Guardians of Solitude have taken me part of the way. But I'm now looking to your support and to Pangaea pre-sales to carry me through!  €4500 will get me there. Five portraits, 5 lithographs, 10 gilcee prints and 2 full classes will do the job. And the world will be all the richer for it!</p>

<p>So I hope to see you on this journey, deepening the vibration, investing in a richer stillness and a greater beauty, investing in your community and the special space of your home. Your faith and patronage will be rewarded, with treasures that will last centuries, for all to enjoy. The Secrets of Pangaea project is as much about a striving for mastery of expression, as it is an attempt to hauntingly resonate the world. Underlying both is a desire for human connection and that is the very essence of this campaign. I'll get there by hook or by crook, but I'd rather you with me on the way! And if you're not able to make a pledge, you can still help me immensely by sharing this campaign and spreading the word.</p>

</div></div>","Meaningful Visions...
When I was 3 years old, in the north west of Australia, my mother drew me a stick figure, and I thought it was the most magical thing in the world! Over the years that sense of wonder has only grown, just as the language that evokes that wonder has kept evolving. Stick figures at some point became realistic illusions. And realistic illusions soon became meaningful visions.
The poetic and meaningful vision, transmitted in a song of oil, is what I live for; it is the secret I have to give the world. 'The Secrets of Pangaea' is my most ambitious project to date. It has been conceived as a series of large scale paintings, drawings and prints. Already underway I plan to complete the series during a 3 month apprenticeship with the renowned painter, Odd Nerdrum, in Norway, between August and October of this year.
'The Secrets of Pangaea' comes off the back of two successful solo exhibitions of mostly single figure paintings, since moving to Ireland. These were 'The Antique Gaze' (2015) and 'Guardians of Solitude' (2016). The Antique Gaze marked my first foray into Baroque-inspired figurative painting (previously my work had been very modernist). 'The Secrets of Pangaea' marks another shift, this time from single figure portraiture to multi-figure narrative painting. This is a bit like a writer shifting from the short story to the novel, and my chief inspiration, in making this move, has been the Norwegian master Odd Nerdrum. It is an amazing privilege, therefore to be studying with him this year. But I need your help to get me there!

In alleviating such pressure it will allow me to produce a higher quality presentation, in terms of materials (both in quantity and quality), in the production of limited edition lithographs (to be created and printed at Cork Printmakers),  and in the production of a high quality catalogue to complement the exhibition.

This project requires the purchasing of digging equipment, lumber, paint, and other building materials to create lovely, inviting places to poop.</p>
<p>+Showers                                                                                                                                                                       We are constructing an outdoor shower stall on the property to allow members to bathe during the event. This will require lumber, concrete, and other building materials.</p>
<p>+Communal cooking                                                                                                                                                     We are constructing a communal grill/cooking station in the back of the property to improve on our ad-hoc station we put together on the 4<sup>th</sup> last year. We will need to purchase rebar, cinderblocks, propane, and grill grates.</p>
<p>+Generator                                                                                                                                                                       Any remaining funds will go toward the purchase of a dedicated inverter-generator for the event. While this is a very expensive investment, it will not only bring down long terms costs of generator rental, but will provide us with safer, quieter energy for our power needs.</p>
<p>***Please note contributions to this campaign do not cover annual club membership dues***</p>

<p>Normal cost for a mix is about 750.00, with Monarchs running $6-8 each , while the Ladies cost around $3 each.  We would like to add more Monarchs because of the interaction with participants, but also, they are a near Threatened species, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). One of the greatest threats to the Monarch is the loss of food and habitat due to use of herbicides. The plants that they prefer serve as food, habitat and space for reproduction.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>NIA</b>
stands for <b>Northside Independent Artists</b>. We all live and work on the north
side of Chicago, and we give back to the city that inspires us with our art
shows.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>NIA
Fine Art Friday</b>, on December 2<sup>nd</sup>, will be our fourth show. It is not
represented by a gallery or any big arts organization. Like all our shows, it
is a grassroots effort created entirely by us. We are designing it, we will
promote it, and we will pay for the event costs.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need</h3><div> </div><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Because we’ve done this so many times, we can now anticipate what the costs will be. They include space rental; food and beverages for our guests; print materials, including posters, flyers and postcards; hardware for hanging art; and event décor.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We always sell art at our shows, but we also spend at least as much as we earn on event costs. This is not a sustainable model, and we will not be able to continue doing shows at a loss.</p><p align=""justify"">We are asking you to help us pay for <b>NIA Fine Art Friday</b> event costs. Any contribution is welcome – even a $5 donation will help us get closer to our goal.</p> <div> <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">For some of us, the <b>NIA</b> shows represent our only opportunity to present our work to the public, interact with fans, and earn any money from our art. This also means that fans will only get the chance to see most of this work at a <b>NIA </b>show. Your donation literally affects dozens of people.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">For all of us, the shows present valuable learning experiences, as we expand our knowledge of event planning, organization, marketing and promotion. The <b>NIA </b>shows make us better equipped to contribute our time and talents to any number of culturally enriching events. By supporting <b>NIA</b> today, you are ""paying it forward"", helping to nurture all those future events we will create or enhance.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Why You Should Help</h3> <p></p>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you’re a friend or family member of a <b>NIA</b> artist, you know how much this show means to us. Help us realize our dream.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Maybe you’re someone who plans to attend the show in December.

NIA
stands for Northside Independent Artists. We all live and work on the north
side of Chicago, and we give back to the city that inspires us with our art
shows.
NIA
Fine Art Friday, on December 2nd, will be our fourth show. It is not
represented by a gallery or any big arts organization. Like all our shows, it
is a grassroots effort created entirely by us. We are designing it, we will
promote it, and we will pay for the event costs.
   What We Need Because we’ve done this so many times, we can now anticipate what the costs will be. They include space rental; food and beverages for our guests; print materials, including posters, flyers and postcards; hardware for hanging art; and event décor.We always sell art at our shows, but we also spend at least as much as we earn on event costs. This is not a sustainable model, and we will not be able to continue doing shows at a loss.We are asking you to help us pay for NIA Fine Art Friday event costs. Any contribution is welcome – even a $5 donation will help us get closer to our goal.  Why It Matters
For some of us, the NIA shows represent our only opportunity to present our work to the public, interact with fans, and earn any money from our art. This also means that fans will only get the chance to see most of this work at a NIA show. Your donation literally affects dozens of people.
For all of us, the shows present valuable learning experiences, as we expand our knowledge of event planning, organization, marketing and promotion. The NIA shows make us better equipped to contribute our time and talents to any number of culturally enriching events. By supporting NIA today, you are ""paying it forward"", helping to nurture all those future events we will create or enhance.   Why You Should Help 
If you’re a friend or family member of a NIA artist, you know how much this show means to us. Help us realize our dream.Maybe you’re someone who plans to attend the show in December. You can ensure that it actually happens by making a donation today.If you would like to attend the show, but know that you will be unable to, you can still make your presence felt with a donation. It is the next best thing to spending your money on a piece of artwork.Finally, if you’re simply someone who is moved and inspired by our story – the story of non-famous artists with a lot of ambition – please contribute to this fundraiser.If you can't help monetarily at this time, then please help spread the word by sharing this campaign on your favorite social media.

<p><strong>I am looking for good-hearted people who can help me realized my mobile art workshop for children and art enthusiast. Sharing your blessings is a great way to please God.</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Mobile Art Workshop</strong></i> - I also planned to introduce mobile artwork shop for children, to encourage them to pursue  their skills in art and enjoy this talent throughout their lives. This will be a free art workshop that travels from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>I would appeal for a whole-hearted support from Indiegogo backers all over the world. Any help extended is greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>Joel Escol is a frustrated artist and 4th Year Architecture student. He didn't finish his last year in college plus some major subjects due to massive poverty. Out of frustration, he got married and gave up his talent in art and thrashed all his painting materials. Instead, he focused on his work as a Journalist and also on his family. He had forgotten his ultimate dream of establishing a mini art school and teach children all about his brand of artistry.</p>
<p>But the internet and YouTube opened doors to him to live up to his passion in painting and cartooning when he saw great artists and read about their lives.</p>
<p>Now, after 20 years, his passion in painting is here again, as he was more inspired by his over 6,000 neighbors who are survivors of Typhoon Haiyan that hit his hometown two years ago and claimed the lives of over a thousand people. Their children needs help to recover from trauma and he believes he can become part of their recovery.</p>

<p><b>Update (7/19): </b>Wow, we raised 2x the goal in less than 24 hours! We're definitely making books! <strong>If the campaign hits $5,000, I'll add stickers to everyone's order!</strong></p>

<p>I have a notebook of blind contour drawings, where I draw things without looking at the page. It’s supposed to build hand-eye coordination, but you also make some really funny and bad drawings.</p>
<p>A lot of my drawings are of Donald Trump. I’ve turned some of them into this coloring book, Make America Colorful Again, and <strong>I'm donating 100% of proceeds to help immigrants stay in America.</strong></p>
<p>In many of these, I ended up mangling him in some unfortunate way. </p>

<p>There's 21 pictures of Trump, 5 bonus pictures, and a space for you to try your own drawings across 32 pages. Make coloring fun again!</p>
<p>You can color Trump in any way you want. You might also find your own ways to mangle him in some unfortunate way.</p>

<p>Jokes aside, we might shrug off Trump’s promises to build a wall or ban Muslim immigration, but we’ve done it before.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.iibayarea.org/work/list-services/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Immigration Institute of the Bay Area</a> is a non-profit organization that provides high-quality, low-cost immigration legal services to the Bay Area community. </p>
<p>They help immigrants to America stay in this country legally and become American citizens. Their locations offer services in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Dari, Hindi, and Urdu.</p>
<p>Last year, they did:</p>
<ul>
<li>7000 office visits</li>
<li>3000 attendees at Workshops &amp; Trainings</li>
<li>450 VAWA self-petitions / U-Visas</li>
<li>300 Naturalizations</li>
<li>250 Adjustment of Status</li>
<li>250 Work Authorizations</li>
<li>200 Consular Processings</li>
<li>200 Replacements / Renewals of Green Cards</li>
<li>100 Temporary Protective Status applications</li>
</ul>
<p>They also help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>applications for Citizenship and Naturalization</li>
<li><p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) applications, an Obama administration policy which protects illegal immigrants from deportation</p></li>
<li><p>family reunification services, including Lawful Permanent Residence applications for family members, green card applications, and Fiancé(e) visas</p></li>
<li><p>humanitarian services, for domestic violence and crime survivors, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) applicants, and asylees &amp; refugees</p></li>
<li><p>free English as a Second Language (ESL) classes that emphasize speaking and cover United States government, history, and civics, all topics tested during the naturalization interview</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a <a href=""http://www.iibayarea.org/work/list-services/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">full list of their services</a>. Services are provided on a sliding scale based on income. Additionally, the group is largely managed and operated by people of color.</p>
<p>You should also <a href=""http://www.iibayarea.org/donate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">donate to them directly</a>!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To maximize the proceeds we can pass on to the IIBA, I'm self-publishing and distributing the book! That'll mean that I'll have to figure out things like how to print a lot of copies and how to ship them out, so it may take me a bit longer to get things to you.</p>
<p>Other than that, the book is done and you can <a href=""https://makeamericacolorfulagain.com/trump_ebooks.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download it right now</a> to print at home! </p>

<p>1) <a href=""https://vote.usa.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">register to vote</a> (takes 10 min online)!

<p>2) to speak out against hateful speech whenever you encounter it in your community, even if the people being hated on look nothing like you, and even if it's awkward. We'll come together only if we understand each other first.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can spend some time volunteering at an <a href=""https://www.volunteermatch.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">organization in your community</a> which helps folks who may not feel so American right now.</p>

The Immigration Institute of the Bay Area is a non-profit organization that provides high-quality, low-cost immigration legal services to the Bay Area community. 
They help immigrants to America stay in this country legally and become American citizens. Their locations offer services in English, Spanish, Mandarin, Dari, Hindi, and Urdu.
Last year, they did:

7000 office visits
3000 attendees at Workshops & Trainings
450 VAWA self-petitions / U-Visas
300 Naturalizations
250 Adjustment of Status
250 Work Authorizations
200 Consular Processings
200 Replacements / Renewals of Green Cards
100 Temporary Protective Status applications

They also help with:

applications for Citizenship and Naturalization
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) applications, an Obama administration policy which protects illegal immigrants from deportation
family reunification services, including Lawful Permanent Residence applications for family members, green card applications, and Fiancé(e) visas
humanitarian services, for domestic violence and crime survivors, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) applicants, and asylees & refugees
free English as a Second Language (ESL) classes that emphasize speaking and cover United States government, history, and civics, all topics tested during the naturalization interview

Here's a full list of their services. Services are provided on a sliding scale based on income. Additionally, the group is largely managed and operated by people of color.
You should also donate to them directly!

 
Risks & Challenges
To maximize the proceeds we can pass on to the IIBA, I'm self-publishing and distributing the book! That'll mean that I'll have to figure out things like how to print a lot of copies and how to ship them out, so it may take me a bit longer to get things to you.
Other than that, the book is done and you can download it right now to print at home! 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, no problem! The PDF is free, so please download it and color it at home. 
In return, I ask two things:
1) register to vote (takes 10 min online)! Even if you don't like any of the presidential candidates, 88% of all seats in Congress are up for election this year — 469 in total — and they're the ones who make the laws. Your vote matters!
2) to speak out against hateful speech whenever you encounter it in your community, even if the people being hated on look nothing like you, and even if it's awkward. We'll come together only if we understand each other first.
Otherwise, you can spend some time volunteering at an organization in your community which helps folks who may not feel so American right now.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Timeline:</b> This is a large project, and Burning Man is in 3 months. This is why we've spent the last several months planning, finding a crew, and figuring out exactly how we're going to build this thing. We've worked out a build schedule that will ensure we get the piece done in time. We're also working with experienced fabricators who know the ins and outs of building for Burning Man, so we're confident we can do this well.</p>
<p><b>Budget: </b>One risk is that there could be unforeseen costs that might go way over budget and risk the project. In order to prevent this danger from occurring, we have researched all costs carefully. In many cases, we've been discussing costs for months with vendors and laborers. We're pretty confident in our budgeting for this project. There is, of course, the risk that we will not meet the fundraising goal. If we do not meet the Indiegogo goal, we will still complete this project (this is possible because of the grant we have received) but might have to complete it at slightly smaller scale. </p>
<p><b>Structural engineering:</b> We've been consulting with an external structural engineering firm, who are working with us to design the structure and give it an engineer's stamp of approval.</p>
<p><b>Crew:</b> We've got a solid core team, consisting of the two artists, a project manager, a lighting and build manager, and a fiberglass expert. This is the minimum that we would need in order to make this project a reality, but if you are interested in volunteering, we'd love your help!

<p><b>Rewards:</b> The hand-crafted rewards (the 3D printed models and bases) have been planned for and are already being worked on. I have also identified and vetted suppliers for the rewards that are not hand-crafted and have done careful research into shipping and material costs for all rewards. These estimates have been included in our budget calculations.</p>

We also found ourselves a wonderful mix of poetry, art, home-made cakes and coffee.<br/><br/>As this mix of art-forms stood in the face of 2017, we decided that we needed a new name, some new handmade furniture and a new exhibition to show it all off in.

<p><i>2. something observed in a scientific investigation or experiment that is not naturally present but occurs as a result of the preparative or investigative procedure.</i><br/> </p>
<p>Our open call for responses to our new name, in the site specific context of Stirchley (which is where we have been lovingly based, ever since we first opened) has given us some amazing artworks. We'd actually love to properly print/frame and prepare the cafe to exhibit these works.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise £500 to help us do this.</p>
<p>The money will go towards printing costs, exhibition material, gifts to thank our participating artists for all their hard work as well as creating spaces and opportunity for future artists and art events.</p>
<p><i>Exhibition artists are:</i></p>
<p>Fred Hubble, Jonathan Wright, Suzi Osborn, Lucy Hutchinson, Sophie Huckfield, Duncan Poulton, Liz Hardy, Antonio Roberts and James Kennedy.</p>

<b>You might be asking yourself, why would I care about a makerspace in Medellín, Colombia? </b><div>
<b><br/></b><div>
<p><b><b>To us, a makerspace and the maker movement, are about much more than just a room full of tools and machinery.  It represents an alternative.  We see the maker movement as the new Declaration of Independence.  However, this declaration does not seek liberation from any imperial nation, it seeks only to break the chains that currently limit our creativity.  For we have always been free, and always will be, no matter where we live. The maker movement is about acknowledging that very freedom in a time where it has never been more accessible.  Makerspaces are the platforms from which this freedom can be realized, If the internet democratized access to information, makerspaces will democratize the capacity to produce.

<p></p>
<p>At Göra we've been working hard for over a year to bring Medellín its first makerspace.  We've identified our two biggest challenges in bringing Medellín the makerspace it needs.</p>
<p>1. Our lack of a fixed location to build the community </p>
<p>2. Our lack of a serious selection of tools and machinery.</p>
<p>Acquiring the space and tools we need are only the beginning of our journey.  We will face other challenges to be sure:</p>
<p>Building a thriving community is our main goal, and in order to do that we must be a sustainable operation.  It will be difficult to find the right equilibrium between remaining accessible to as many people as possible and maintaining a manageable community size that allows sustainability.  For example, if we charge a very cheap rate then we will need a lot of members to be sustainable which we currently cannot handle and if we charge a very high rate we will be denying access to many of the people we wish to collaborate with.  </p>
<p>What we are doing to overcome this challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with other makerspaces from all over the world to gain insight from their experiences and re-evaluate our own.</li>
<li>Reach out to other local small business to gain support and guidance.</li>
<li>Collaborate with other local businesses in ways to help with promotion and seek sustainability together.</li>
<li>Maintain the lowest costs possible.</li>
<li>Gather feedback from our members and the community.</li>
<li>Acquire the necessary business consultations we need to properly address our challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other challenges include navigating the Colombian legal environment in terms of insurance and employment laws.  We have found quality lawyers to help us, but they're not free! </p>

<p style=""color:#da0080;""><b>We Need to Raise at least $20,000! </b></p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the first things
that we want to have in our makerspace. With $20,000 the first two things we
will spend money on are a laser cutter and securing our own place with at least
six months rent in the bank.  This is a wish list for the amount of space
we want to have and the machines and tools we would fill it up with (with
growth in mind!): </p>
<p>With a warehouse of 8,503 sq. ft. we could
have an amazing place to start. That would  work well for the first two
years.  We could however start with less and just sign only a one year
lease, but we expect rapid growth after the first year.  We have
approximates for how much space each work section will require:</p>
<p>Carpentry – 120 m2 (384 sq. ft.)</p>
<p>Welding – 100 m2 (320 sq. ft.)</p>
<p>Electronics – 30 m2 (96 sq. ft.)</p>

You might be asking yourself, why would I care about a makerspace in Medellín, Colombia? 

To us, a makerspace and the maker movement, are about much more than just a room full of tools and machinery.  It represents an alternative.  We see the maker movement as the new Declaration of Independence.  However, this declaration does not seek liberation from any imperial nation, it seeks only to break the chains that currently limit our creativity.  For we have always been free, and always will be, no matter where we live. The maker movement is about acknowledging that very freedom in a time where it has never been more accessible.  Makerspaces are the platforms from which this freedom can be realized, If the internet democratized access to information, makerspaces will democratize the capacity to produce. From a makerspace we can truly leverage our combined human knowledge and experiences and transform them into useful solutions and innovations.  
The maker movement represents a new paradigm.  It's a new way of thinking, a profound global cultural rebirth. It provides the foundation to experience life in a new and more fulfilling way. To make is to share, every time you make something you leave a piece of yourself in that which you created. There is no greater gift to give than this, nor any greater gift to receive.
Medellín is a vibrant city full of creativity and passion.  Help us unlock this city's massive potential and show the world what people can accomplish when they come together for a common goal!

Impact
Despite our challenges over the first year (most pressing being our lack of serious tools and our own space to create) we have spread the maker movement throughout the city and have seen the birth and growth of maker businesses:

Ventus - a drone software company with a marketplace for drone apps (www.appsdrones.com) 
Maker Colombia - Educational robotics kits  (http://makercolombia.com/)
EMET Robotics - Build and teach advanced robotics (http://www.emet-robotics.com/)
Me&Co - Mechanical engineering company 
El Guardian - An app to provide sober drivers in the city (https://www.facebook.com/El-Guardian-Conductore...)

Building a thriving community is our main goal, and in order to do that we must be a sustainable operation.  It will be difficult to find the right equilibrium between remaining accessible to as many people as possible and maintaining a manageable community size that allows sustainability.  For example, if we charge a very cheap rate then we will need a lot of members to be sustainable which we currently cannot handle and if we charge a very high rate we will be denying access to many of the people we wish to collaborate with.  
What we are doing to overcome this challenge:

Communicate with other makerspaces from all over the world to gain insight from their experiences and re-evaluate our own.
Reach out to other local small business to gain support and guidance.
Collaborate with other local businesses in ways to help with promotion and seek sustainability together.
Maintain the lowest costs possible.
Gather feedback from our members and the community.
Acquire the necessary business consultations we need to properly address our challenges.

Other challenges include navigating the Colombian legal environment in terms of insurance and employment laws.  We have found quality lawyers to help us, but they're not free!

We Need to Raise at least $20,000! 
Here is a list of some of the first things
that we want to have in our makerspace. With $20,000 the first two things we
will spend money on are a laser cutter and securing our own place with at least
six months rent in the bank.  This is a wish list for the amount of space
we want to have and the machines and tools we would fill it up with (with
growth in mind!): 
With a warehouse of 8,503 sq. ft. we could
have an amazing place to start. That would  work well for the first two
years.  We could however start with less and just sign only a one year
lease, but we expect rapid growth after the first year.  We have
approximates for how much space each work section will require:
Carpentry – 120 m2 (384 sq. ft.)
Welding – 100 m2 (320 sq. ft.)
Electronics – 30 m2 (96 sq. ft.)
3D Printing – 50 m2 (160 sq. ft.)
Sewing – 50 m2 (160 sq. ft.)
Painting – 30 m2 (96 sq. ft.)
Design – 40 m2 (128 sq. ft.)
CNC – 70 m2 (224 sq. ft.)
Water Cutter – 100 m2 (320 sq. ft.)
Garden – 80 m2 (256 sq. ft.)
Community – 40 m2 (128 sq. ft.)
Kitchen – 50 m2 (160 sq. ft.)
Lobby – 20 m2 (64 sq. ft.)
Lockers – 10 m2 (30 sq. ft.)
(gallery – 60 m2/192 sq. ft.)
Total= 574 m2/6178 sq ft.
Expensive Machinery Needed:
Wood working basics:
CNC Machine – X carve = $1,279
Wood Lathe – Central Machinery = $299
Drill Press - $200
Jig Saw manual – Milwaukee 720w 500- 3000 rpm

<p>Meowchi are sweet mochi kittens that come in a <a href=""https://www.tastypeachstudios.com/collections/meowchi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">range of flavors and variants</a>. Created in 2012 by our artist, Ryan Zanfei, they have quickly become a staple character of our brand! The first standard 5 inch sized Meowchi plush was produced within that first year. Since then, we've created over 20 flavors and variants of these palm sized kittens!</p>
<p><strong>What is Tasty Peach Studios?</strong></p>
<p>We are a sweet, unique boutique that sells adorable, indie merchandise inspired by Japan! Every character and design is made by our artist with love and care. We started off in 2007 in our Etsy shop crafting hand made clay charms and jewelry. Since then we have grown to become one of the leading Indie brands on the convention circuit, providing high quality metal jewelry, accessories, plush, apparel, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>So why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest requests we have had for this character is bigger versions. Our Kickstarter successfully funded these guys' first run with an overwhelming 150K campaign! But as we stated before, bigger plush means higher production costs and the need for extra storage space.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter allowed us to purchase a large warehouse to store a lot of our merchandise and goodies in, but we're still only able to take up so much space with the Giant Meowchi we're funding on Indiegogo! That means they'll be available once a year, early each year for pre-orders! So this year we've chosen Indiegogo to host these orders to hopefully fund another round of these cuties! With Indiegogo we also don't need to reach a ""goal"" to be successful, we just collect the funds and orders what you pay for! So there will be LITTLE TO NO EXTRAS!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516905582/kvthrjloopfslvbxroud.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>When getting any plush made, there are always many steps from start to finish, including multiple revisions to the initial design. Like all plush, each Meowchi started off as a concept design.

and communities. Aside from peace, I also facilitate creative workshops that
promote cultural heritage, environmental education; and transformative and
healing arts. 

Currently, I am designing a peace art program for a children's museum and integrating an art campaign that will work with children to make the call for the end of armed conflict in this generation for the peace talks taking place between the government and armed rebel groups in my country. 
 
On May 31 this year, I received a formal approval for my tuition scholarship for my first year
at the European Graduate School for a Masters Degree in Expressive Arts for
Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding. This degree requires a month long
visit to Saas – Fee in Switzerland every July. for three years. Everything else will be on
distance learning where one can focus on applying the study in one’s chosen
community.

My
intention is to study sacred and indigenous art themes to develop my practice
of transformative and community based art. The plan is to integrate
Asian themes with existing  creative and transformative processes and frameworks.
The study will be applied with my work with interfaith/intercultural community
partners in the Philippines and around Asia to be used in arts relief,
dialogue, and community building. My intention is also to work with local
culture and wisdom bearers and co-create modules and artworks with them and
their community. 
Making
Peace Work through Creativity 
My
contribution in the field of conflict transformation and peacebuilding will be
through developing creative mechanisms that further validate the importance of
interior factors and processes like interfaith dialogue, creativity, and
indigenous wisdom as vital components to achieving integral sustainable development. 

The
study and the practice will also be documenting traditional arts, wisdom and
practice that can contribute to the wealth of existing peacebuilding
approaches. 

The
output of the study will be co-created modules and artworks together with local
culture bearers and their community members that will be used for arts relief,
dialogue, and community building. 

This
year, my intention is to benefit and work with interfaith/intercultural
communities in Metro Manila and Mindanao to bridge the people to creative and peaceful
solutions to armed conflict in the country. The next two years will be work
around conflict affected areas in Asia. 
 


Let's Have a Co-Creative Partnership 
Because I have consciously decided to be an artist surviving as a consultant
for project management jobs since late last year instead of doing full time
work that has regular pay, my funds are not enough to support myself for this
trip. I come from a middle class family with simple needs and I do not wish to
burden my parents for they have already given me so much to help me become the
empowered adult that I am now.

This peace starts with myself. So I am now embodying this intention for peace by
connecting with you. Believe me it has been a challenge to ask.I am 
trying to consciously use the word ""invitation"" instead of ""challenge"" 
now. I only have barely a month to fundraise since I got my tuition 
scholarship formally approved. I even went through doubts asking myself why I should go through all this trouble and stress. So after playing cha-cha with the universe, I asked myself WHY NOT? So all this is an invitation  to humility, sharing, and abundance!

I am raising $5,500 for the following:
1.  Round Trip Air Ticket to Zurich, Switzerland - $1,500
2.  Lodging at Hotel Allalin (required venue for stay) - $ 2,700
3.  Travel Allowance for train transfers and pocket money  - $
800
4. I didn't mention this in the video but If there's extra, I'd like to buy a new netbook or upgrade my 4
year old Asus Laptop that needs keyboard and memory repair - $ 500 

Please see the wonderful perks I can share as energy exchange for your support. If you have other ideas. Let's talk.

<h3>Our Story <br/>
</h3> <p><span class=""agText"">I have spent the last 10 Years working full time as
 a Clinical Massage Therapist, while working part time on my jewelry 
&amp; photography careers. My husband, Thano, has spent many years working in retail management, while spending nights, weekends &amp; days off working as my Lapidary Artist/Mining Stones. We have decided now is the time to make the jump... so as of a month ago we are working FULL TIME to make our jewelry line our main source of income! This is a HUGE leap for us! We can't do it without your help!<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""agText"">We start our process going out into nature to open pit mining areas around the country. Most of the time these are free sites, but every once in a while we will go to a mine that charges a fee. I am also a photographer, so these trips serve a dual purpose (</span><span class=""agText"">I sell my prints on the same Etsy shop as our jewelry)</span><span class=""agText"">. Often times we have to hike out quite a distance to gather our gemstones, usually in beautiful &amp; secluded nature! The perfect place for a photographer! While mining our stones Thano &amp; I are sending Reiki to the earth &amp; the stones. Once we are home we continue to use Reiki throughout the entire process of creating our jewelry, including </span>the lapidary process, to clear negative energy out of all our materials, while 
raising the vibration of all of our work. All of our Jewelry is one of a kind. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It is our DREAM to have our Jewelry Line be our main source of income! <br/></p>
<span class=""agText""></span><p><span class=""agText""><br/></span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What happens if we don't reach our campaign goal? <br/>
</h3>We will continue to move forward with our plans even if we do not meet our goal, it just may take us a lot longer &amp; we may have to go back to part time work on our dream.<br/><p>The money will go toward what it can, we may not be able to get everything on our list, but we'll get what we can.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to buy Jewelry &amp; Lapidary equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>Including but not limited to: raw sterling silver, new lapidary saws/blades/ grinding wheels/ sandpaper etc., jewelry tools, flex shaft drill, drill bits, solder, torch, gasses (propane &amp; oxygen).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need to fund mining trips to gather stones for our jewelry.</p>
<p>We are looking to go back to Pala, Ca for tourmaline. <br/></p>
<p>We would like to go to Oregon for sunstone. We also have many more close trips planned for petrified wood, jasper and more. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also need to pay for website hosting services, our website is currently being hosted for free &amp; it has ads across the top, something we would like to change asap! <a href=""http://www.erindonnellyellis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""erindonnellyellis.com"">erindonnellyellis.com</a><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story 
 I have spent the last 10 Years working full time as
 a Clinical Massage Therapist, while working part time on my jewelry 
& photography careers. My husband, Thano, has spent many years working in retail management, while spending nights, weekends & days off working as my Lapidary Artist/Mining Stones. We have decided now is the time to make the jump... so as of a month ago we are working FULL TIME to make our jewelry line our main source of income! This is a HUGE leap for us! We can't do it without your help!

We start our process going out into nature to open pit mining areas around the country. Most of the time these are free sites, but every once in a while we will go to a mine that charges a fee. I am also a photographer, so these trips serve a dual purpose (I sell my prints on the same Etsy shop as our jewelry). Often times we have to hike out quite a distance to gather our gemstones, usually in beautiful & secluded nature! The perfect place for a photographer! While mining our stones Thano & I are sending Reiki to the earth & the stones. Once we are home we continue to use Reiki throughout the entire process of creating our jewelry, including the lapidary process, to clear negative energy out of all our materials, while 
raising the vibration of all of our work. All of our Jewelry is one of a kind. 

It is our DREAM to have our Jewelry Line be our main source of income! 


What happens if we don't reach our campaign goal? 
We will continue to move forward with our plans even if we do not meet our goal, it just may take us a lot longer & we may have to go back to part time work on our dream.The money will go toward what it can, we may not be able to get everything on our list, but we'll get what we can.


What We Need & What You Get
We need to buy Jewelry & Lapidary equipment and supplies.
Including but not limited to: raw sterling silver, new lapidary saws/blades/ grinding wheels/ sandpaper etc., jewelry tools, flex shaft drill, drill bits, solder, torch, gasses (propane & oxygen).

We need to fund mining trips to gather stones for our jewelry.
We are looking to go back to Pala, Ca for tourmaline. 
We would like to go to Oregon for sunstone. We also have many more close trips planned for petrified wood, jasper and more. 

We also need to pay for website hosting services, our website is currently being hosted for free & it has ads across the top, something we would like to change asap! erindonnellyellis.com

We are looking to do a lot of craft events this year, so we need to fund entry & jury fees, a canopy & weights, tables & display (we have one table, 2 chairs & some display, but we will need more).

We are also looking to move our studio! 

Please view our Perks for all the things you can redeem!

Why Machine de Cirque?
Founder Vincent Dubé has been a comedy
and circus performer for nearly 20 years, as well as an engineering graduate. He
is also interested in the percussions he incorporates in his artisitic work. Based
on this diverse expertise, he wants to combine all his passions to create a
unique endeavour – Machine de Cirque.Pourquoi Machine de Cirque?
Le fondateur, Vincent Dubé est un
homme de cirque et de comédie depuis près de 20 ans, et diplômé d'ingénierie.
Il s'intéresse également aux percussions qu'il intègre à son travail artistique. Fort
de ces expériences diverses, il a eu envie de réunir toutes ses passions pour
en faire une créature unique, Machine de Cirque.


Circus and Engineering? Like
Cirque du Soleil?
The engineering team is integral to the
process from the start, which helps incorporate it seamlessly while showcasing
the value of the performers. With only 1% of Cirque du Soleil’s budget, Machine
de cirque has to rely on ingenious solutions, repurposed day-to-day objects,
and contraptions operated with elbow grease – the fuel with the best
quality/cost ratio on the market. This is a human scale project where each of
the five performers occupies a vital place on stage. With a small team, the
artists and art and technical designers can all gather around the drawing board
to produce an unexpected exchange of ideas and astounding results.Cirque et ingénierie? Comme le Cirque du Soleil?L'équipe d'ingénierie est introduite au

The Team / L'équipe
RAPHAËL and YOHANN are one of the 10 best juggling acts in the
world in addition to all the other skills they master – artistic bicycling,
acrobatics, unicycling.
And let’s not forget their runaway smash hit
with the Towel Act that was a favourite on YouTube around the world.
RAPHAËL et YOHANN font partie des dix meilleures équipes de jonglerie au monde en plus de toutes les autres disciplines où ils excellent : vélo artistique, acrobatie, monocycle.
Il ne faut pas oublier leur succès retentissant avec leur numéro de serviette qui fait sensation sur YouTube et à travers le monde. 








MAXIM and UGO are a hit wherever they go with their teeter board acrobatics act:
— Gold Medal at the Paris Cirque de Demain Festival
— Gold Medal at Youngstage in Switzerland
MAXIM et UGO font un malheur partout où ils passent grâce à leur numéro de planche coréenne :
— Médaille d'or au Festival de Cirque de Demain à Paris
— Médaille d'or à Youngstage en Suisse

FRÉDÉRIC is a consummate actor, musician and composer, and will soon add new arrows to his quiver with juggling and acrobatics!!

FRÉDÉRIC c'est un acteur, un musicien et un compositeur émérite. Et prochainement, de nouvelles cordes seront ajoutées à son arc : la jonglerie et la haute voltige acrobatique!!




Why are the best performers
joining Machine de Cirque?
Because they believe in the project.
Because they play a large part in the
creation process.
Because they want to explore, innovate and
create a Company with a unique style.
Because they have humongous fun working

Pourquoi les meilleurs artistes se joignent-ils à Machine de Cirque?
Parce qu'ils croient au projet.
Parce qu'ils ont une grande place dans tout le processus de création.

you help fund this project or not, the show will go ahead and be premiered in
Quebec City on May 21, 2015. The venue has been booked and a show will be put
on with the available resources.
The team is made up of experienced
contributors who know how to repeatedly create shows within the constraints of
time and money.
Machine de Cirque already possesses the
minimum resources required to create the project. We have already collected 45%
of the project’s total budget through grants. Our campaign objective represents
20% of the total cost. This 20% can make all the difference. We have what we
need to pay for the boring stuff – studio space, insurance, venues, administration,
promotion, etc.
Your contribution will be specifically
invested in the quality of the show’s contents (art and technical design, research
and development). It will help develop the project’s full potential. It’s that 20%
that will allow us to innovate.

Pourquoi nous faire confiance?
Vous avez déjà financé un projet qui n'a pas vu le jour. Ce ne sera pas le cas avec Machine de Cirque. Que vous le financiez ou pas, il y aura un spectacle créé qui sera présenté en première à Québec le 21 mai 2015. La salle est réservée et un spectacle sera livré avec les ressources disponibles.L'équipe est composée de collaborateurs d'expérience qui ont su créer des spectacles dans les contraintes de temps et d'argent à plusieurs reprises. Machine de Cirque dispose déjà des ressources minimales nécessaires pour faire le projet. Nous avons déjà amassé 45% du budget total du projet en subventions. Notre objectif de campagne représente 20 % du projet. Ce 20 % peut faire toute la différence  Nous avons ce qu'il faut pour payer les trucs ennuyeux : locaux, assurances, salles, administration, promotion etc. Votre contribution sera investie uniquement sur la qualité du contenu du spectacle (conception artistique et technique, recherche et développement). Elle permettra de développer le projet à son plein potentiel. C'est avec ce 20% que nous pourrons innover.Projected Project Revenue / Revenus projetés du projetProjected Project Expenses / Dépenses projetées du projetWhat Impact Will Your Contribution
Have
Your contribution will make a difference on the show’s impact. With your
help Machine de Cirque has better chances of inserting itself into the artistic
milieu and tour theaters near you, wherever you live on this planet.
With its great international experience, the
Company has all the necessary contact points to reach you, our eager public! But
we need help to produce a show that will really stand out.
The success of our first show will allow the
Company to develop and invest in other creations. Your contribution can
therefore have a long-term impact.
Impact de votre contribution
Votre contribution fera la différence
sur l'impact qu'aura ce spectacle. Avec votre aide, Machine de Cirque a
beaucoup plus de chances de s’introduire dans le milieu artistique et de faire
la tournée des théâtres près de chez vous, où que vous soyez sur la planète.

Par sa grande expérience internationale,
la compagnie a tous les contacts nécessaires pour se rendre jusqu’à vous,
public impatient! Mais nous avons besoin d’aide pour faire un spectacle qui se
démarque vraiment.Le succès du premier spectacle permettra à la compagnie de se développer et d'investir dans d'autres créations. Votre contribution peut donc avoir un impact à long terme.Original Perks / Des contreparties uniques

<p>The Contemporary Arts Museum Houston’s Teen Council needs your

a biennial exhibition. This year’s exhibition, From the Margins, will present artworks in a variety of media by
Houston-area teens, which will be selected by the Teen Council. From the Margins will include works that
speak to the teenaged artists’ experience with or observation of
marginalization – considering communities that were once on the fringe that
are becoming more mainstream. Who are we?Teen council is a group of 12-13 Houston-area teens employed by the museum to curate exhibitions, contribute to outreach and education programs by sharing a teenaged perspective on art, and gain valuable museum experience. CAMH is one of the few museums in the nation with programming directed specifically toward teens, and the only museum in the nation that puts teens directly in the driver's seat.Our mission:CAMH is a non-collecting institution dedicated to presenting the best and most exciting international, national, and regional art. CAMH is a leading destination to experience innovative art and actively encourages engagement with its exhibitions by art enthusiasts of all ages through its educational programs, publications, and online resources. Admission to the CAMH is always free.Our motto:ALWAYS FRESH, ALWAYS FREE  
Impact
According to ""Room to Rise: The Lasting Impact of Intensive Teen Programs in Art Museums,"" a study by the Institute for Museum and Library Sciences,  teen-oriented museum programs have an immense impact on their alumni*:



Personal growth and self-knowledge - teens gain a lasting sense of identity, achievement, and empowerment

Wide career horizons - these programs expose the teens to new career paths and opportunities

Real-world life skills - teens develop useful and transferable skills

Transformed relationships with museums - teens gain greater sense of belonging in and appreciation for museums

Community engagement and influence - teens more highly value community, collaboration, and diversity

*All information in the above bullet list is cited from the Institute for Museum and Library Sciences study entitled ""Room to Rise: The Lasting Impact of Intensive Teen Programs in Art Museums,"" set to publish later this year.

This is a huge opportunity for my artistic career; I just graduated art school and this will give me a really important opportunity to immerse myself in artistic research for a month. This really is allowing me to kick-start my career as an artist.<br/><br/>During the residency I am going to explore how to combine sculptural practices with the 2 dimensional world of printmaking. I want to print on various surfaces and use various sculptural practices to draw out that print into a three-dimensional form.<br/><br/><strong>""But why do you need funding?""</strong></p>
<p>Well, you see I got accepted last minute to do the residency, meaning I found out at the end of June that I will be going there for September 1st. This gives me two months to save up thousands of dollars with my part-time, minimum wage job. While I expect I will be able to save some money over the two months, I am financially independent (meaning I pay rent, food, everything myself) and I am looking to other sources for funding. If all else fails I will take out a small loan, but I really abhor being in debt. If my funds are raised, they will go to two things specifically:</p>
<p><strong>My flight, 1000:</strong> Flights from Toronto to Amsterdam and back, (especially when last minute) will probably cost me about $850-$1000, according to my research. I budgeted 1000 because I also know that indiegogo skims about 4-9% off the money you raise in order to pay for the website.<br/><br/><strong>My Studio Fee, 750:</strong> The studio fee is 550 euro, which translates to about $750 CAD. This covers studio costs for the month, the provided accomodation, and some materials.<br/><br/><strong>Extra Funds:</strong> If I manage to raise extra funds somehow, I would first jump up and down for joy, and then I would spend them on such neccesities as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Travel Insurance</li>
<li>Extra Supplies (Paper, ink)</li>
<li>Covering rent while I am gone</li>
</ul><p><strong>""What do I get for helping?""</strong><br/><br/>Well, my dear madam or sir! Any contribution helps, and will recieve my deepest gratitude.

Up until now, my current body of work has been focused around the representation of insects. Insects have become a metaphor for fears to me, as I used to be terribly afraid and revulsed by them. Around September 2012 I started to use them as my subject matter. When you draw something, you objectify it, it becomes less symbolic of something scary and becomes a conglomeration of lines, dots, shapes, forms. You learn to see the beauty in a thing, when you draw it. <br/><br/>Simultaneously, I began a project in street art, a medium which both fascinated me and scared me. Going out at night alone when you're a lady is scary, especially when you frequent run down and abandoned buildings. I began to wheatpaste prints of insects to the construction and abandoned walls of my city. Wheatpaste is a simple, organic paste made from flour, sugar, and water, which causes no damage to buildings and which small insects like to sometimes eat.<br/><br/>To see the products of this body of work (and also some other stuff) check out my tumblr <a href=""http://paper-bug.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://paper-bug.tumblr.com</a> .

I am traveling trip to Ghana to work with the amazing organization Cross Cultural Collaborative to run an art workshop for the children of Nungua.  The skills they learn and projects they complete can be sold to help with their school tuition. This is a great way for students to embrace creativity and personal expression while learning sustainable skills that will support them. 
My conversations with Ellie Shimelman, the director of the program, have given me many ideas about projects to do at the Cultural center. Most of these will utilize the materials that are available in Ghana, many of which are recycled. One of the more plentiful resources is black plastic bags, which we will be using in various means of weaving and fusing to make reusable bags and other items. 

I have received a grant from the SMFA to cover my flight to Ghana. I would like to raise funds to bring supplies to the cultural center. They have limited art supplies and resource materials and I would love to be able to bring some necessary basics. If the students wish to do art in school, they are responsible for buying their own supplies which most cannot afford to do. Please specify with your donation what you would like the funds to be used for!



Here is what your donation will provide:

$100 printer ink
                     Ink is hard to find there, expensive, and dries out quickly due to the high heat
$100 paint and art supplies 
                     The youth have very few supplies to work with. Mostly crayons :(
$100 paper
                     Ellie says they go through paper like crazy!
$300 silk screen supplies

                     I will be teaching the youth how to silkscreen so that they can design t-shirts to sell
$200 secondhand or new t-shirts 
                     For the youth to print on and wear or sell
$200 extra bag fee
                     We have a donation of 4 laptops and other art supplies and believe it or not, this is the cheapest way to get supplies to Ghana.

I feel a great sense of urgency to share and begin dialogues with people. This is why I've created the Eco Heart Oracle deck. I've also recently started www.EcoHeartRetreats.com offering virtual 
retreats reconnecting people back to the Earth - these one day retreats 
can be done from anywhere in the world. I believe in giving back and sharing and that together we can create change in our lives and in the world. I began publishing Eco Heart Magazine in 2013 as another way of giving back - I was a designer working in print media before becoming an artist. The magazine is about spirituality, art, environment and healing and shares articles from, and about, people working in different ways and modalities who are creating positive heart-centered change in the world. Please sign up for your free subscription here: Eco Heart Magazine - SuscribeOther ways you can helpPlease share the Eco Heart Oracle deck campaign with your friends and family - it's easy using the Indiegogo share tools! Together we can create change!

<p><b>For the last 18 years, Meridian Gallery has employed hundreds of low-income, minority teens from all over San Francisco as part of its Meridian Interns Program (MIP). </b>Our young interns, aged 14-17, meet everyday after school and throughout the summer to work as artists-in-training, learning to paint, draw, sculpt, carve, and create printed artworks in the gallery’s on-site studio. <b>That’s right – they’re paid to make art!</b> Taught by professional artist instructors (some of whom are former interns themselves), these teens gain invaluable work experience and professional skills within the setting of a non-profit, contemporary art gallery. <b>But as Meridian Gallery faces the threat of eviction, the future of MIP is in jeopardy. </b>Please help us keep this important program alive, and in turn, support the burgeoning young artist community of San Francisco.</p>
<p>MIP is not only a great part-time job for low-income teens (whose families often depend on them for their financial contributions), it's also an educational program that prepares them for future employment. MIP offers our young interns academic and career counseling as well as the opportunity to develop valuable social skills (critical thinking, literacy, verbal and visual communication, team work, discipline) and transferable job skills (use of computer graphics programs and desktop publishing tools, publication writing, gallery maintenance, installation of shows, and financial literacy). <b>It is our goal to help these kids prepare for the future, and have fun doing it.</b></p>
<p>At the end of every term, the interns organize and install their own show at the Meridian Gallery so that they can share their creations with the world. (In fact, their latest exhibition, <i>Toward a Natural World: Exploring Indigenous Cultures and Native Plants of the Coastal Bay Area</i>, is on display until Friday, August 22. Come check it out!) They also produce an annual “zine,” or do-it-yourself magazine, which features all of their favorite artworks and commemorates social highlights from the year, including holiday celebrations and field trips to nearby art galleries, museums, and parks. The young interns are also very involved in local community work, beautifying San Francisco by restoring murals and planting gardens.</p>

Our young interns, aged 14-17, meet everyday after school and throughout the summer to work as artists-in-training, learning to paint, draw, sculpt, carve, and create printed artworks in the gallery’s on-site studio. That’s right – they’re paid to make art! Taught by professional artist instructors (some of whom are former interns themselves), these teens gain invaluable work experience and professional skills within the setting of a non-profit, contemporary art gallery. But as Meridian Gallery faces the threat of eviction, the future of MIP is in jeopardy. Please help us keep this important program alive, and in turn, support the burgeoning young artist community of San Francisco.
MIP is not only a great part-time job for low-income teens (whose families often depend on them for their financial contributions), it's also an educational program that prepares them for future employment. MIP offers our young interns academic and career counseling as well as the opportunity to develop valuable social skills (critical thinking, literacy, verbal and visual communication, team work, discipline) and transferable job skills (use of computer graphics programs and desktop publishing tools, publication writing, gallery maintenance, installation of shows, and financial literacy).

What We Need & What You Get

 We need to raise $50,000 to keep the Meridian Interns Program alive. 
The majority of the funds, $40,000, will be used to secure a new lease so that the youth interns can stay in their studio here at Meridian Gallery for years to come. This location is so important to the success of the program for a number of reasons: 1) It is easily accessible from all over the city, making MIP available to all low-income teenagers with a passion for art; 2) It is nearby many galleries, museums, and cultural centers, giving kids who might not otherwise have an opportunity to visit these art and educational institutions a chance to learn and be inspired; 3) It houses an on-site studio fully equipped with art supplies, cooking facilities, and desktop computers for graphic design projects. This studio was installed by co-founders Anne Brodzky and Anthony Williams in 2007, when they renovated the Victorian building's unused basement with the help of MIP interns. 
The Meridian Interns Program's studio is housed in the lowest level of the Meridian Gallery, located in a beautiful Victorian building at 535 Powell Street, just two blocks from San Francisco's historic Union Square.

The remaining $10,000 will support the program itself. This will be used to:- Pay the youth interns and their artist instructors- Buy healthy food for snacks and meals prepared in the studio kitchen- Buy art supplies and equipment- Cover the costs of installing and promoting exhibitions- Fund field trips to art galleries, museums, parks and cultural centers- Produce the annual MIP zine, the ""Megazine""- Provide all interns with memberships to the de Young Museum


MIP interns prepare everyday meals and special treats - like apple pie - in the studio's kitchenette. 
Ensuring the Future of MIP
The Meridian Interns Program has operated successfully for 18 years. We have a wonderful and dedicated staff of professional artist instructors, centrally-located and well-stocked facilities, and years of experience teaching our paid interns to create unique artworks. Given adequate funding, we will no doubt be able to continue our mission of supporting youth arts education in San Francisco. The biggest threat to the Meridian Interns Program is that of eviction. If we do not raise the $50,000 necessary to secure a new lease to stay in our current building, the program, and all of its participants, will be displaced. This would present a huge challenge to MIP, as we would have to find, secure, and move into a new studio space, which would be a very difficult, time-consuming and expensive endeavor in the increasingly competitive San Franciscan commercial real estate market. We need your help to stay in our beloved building. This alone will ensure the stability of the Meridian Interns Program. Help us keep this amazing program alive.  Spread the Word! Any and all contributions will help us achieve our goal of continuing the Meridian Interns Program in its current home. But there are other ways you can help!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Robbie Chanin and I am looking to raise 30 grand to build an art gallery called: 'Glitter Gallery'.  <br/></p>
<p>Glitter Gallery has funding for gallery space in San Francisco, California.  Robbie is networking to raise $30,000 to stock the in-house artist's studio with art supplies as well as defray the costs of renovation when the gallery space is acquired.  Robbie is a deaf lipreader who uses glitter to share his view..</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Glitter saved my life,"" he says.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Attended Gallaudet University School For the Deaf and Blind in Washington, D.C, Robbie has sold over 500 paintings in the short span since he began painting.  Today, he offers you a proposition for your help to make his dreams come true.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Willing to cut costs wherever it's necessary to raise the roof of Glitter Gallery.  Volunteers have come forward to offer expertise and financial planning.  Philip has only money through investors to purchase a gallery but not enough for in-house artist's studio art supplies and renovation to suit the aesthetic vision that will one day be Glitter Gallery. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If anyone interested in investing into a minority-owned business or friends and artist who love to follow new work, please forward or share this with them.  There are lots of handmade original rewards created exclusively by the artist, Robbie Chanin.<br/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>It's me, an artist with a great passion and even bigger dreams</h3>
<p>Hi there, Let me introduce myself:</p>
<p>My name is Brenda Meelker, a female digital artist from The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Embrision Arts is my artistname.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I was in need of some distraction and opened one of the First Photoshop elements software that I got from my dad.</p>
<p>A bit of experimenting eventually leed to a revelation of my creativity and a true passion began.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I’m a professional digital artist who is trying to expand her career by working for publishers and attending exhibitions. I've done a couple of projects so far but It doesn’t pay my bills yet.</p>
<p>I’m also working as a registered nurse to tie loose ends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you like to see all of my art, please go over here:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://embrisionarts.deviantart.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""My art"">http://embrisionarts.deviantart.com/gallery/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>       My dream, my digital art adventure in New York</h3>
<p>I have attended some exhibitions in my own country, but I never had the opportunity to be part of a Group exhibition in a foreign country.</p>
<p>The company Basak Malone recently invited me to be part of such a great project: A publication in the second edition of the New Collectors book and a Group exhibition in conjunction with this second edition.</p>
<p>The exhibition will take place from 5 till 18 January 2013 in the Ward Nasse Gallery in New York.</p>
<p>I can fund the participation of the publication and exhibition myself, but it will be difficult for me to finance my attendance for a couple of days in New York</p>
<p>You could help me finance my stay in New York to be phycically present at the exhibition.</p>
<p>This is something that is very important to me and really a dream come true.</p>
<p>   </p>
<p>                     Longing Worlds: Voyage to the beauty of nature</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i671.photobucket.com/albums/vv78/Gerbren31/LWVoyagetothebeautyofnatureflickrsmall.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>         What would you fund and what will you get in return</h3>
<p>                                      <strong>Funding:</strong></p>
<p>-The return flight from Amsterdam airport to New York.</p>
<p>-The stay in a middle class hotel.</p>
<p>All funding will go to the trip, even if I don’t make it to my goal. All money is welcome.</p>
<p>All extra funding will go to the transportation of my art to NY (this costs about 500 euro, incl. insurance).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                      <strong>In return:</strong></p>
<p>A lot of gratitude and of course the perks!</p>
<p><strong>If I succeed in achieving my goal:</strong></p>
<p>I will create an exclusive artwork for one of the donators. The selected person will receive a high resolution file of the creation.</p>
<p>This only applies when more than 10 people have contributed.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>                             <strong>What It means to me</strong>
</h3>
<p>I can ship all of my works to New York and watch all the photo’s of the exhibition in my little room in Holland afterwards, but I rather be physically a part of this wonderful adventure.</p>
<p>I would love to have the ability to actually talk about my work to the visitors in the gallery and be able to network with the people from the industry.</p>
<p>It’s eventually a great way to expand my career and It would be a great reward for all the hard work and passion I’ve put in my art so far.</p>
<p>                                 </p>
<h3>                                   Spread the word</h3>
<p>Not able to help me financially?  You are doing me a big favor by spreading the word and make people aware of my dream.</p>
<p>Remember to use the share tools at Indiegogo as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>          Many, many thanks in advance for your support!</h3>

       My dream, my digital art adventure in New York
I have attended some exhibitions in my own country, but I never had the opportunity to be part of a Group exhibition in a foreign country.
The company Basak Malone recently invited me to be part of such a great project: A publication in the second edition of the New Collectors book and a Group exhibition in conjunction with this second edition.
The exhibition will take place from 5 till 18 January 2013 in the Ward Nasse Gallery in New York.
I can fund the participation of the publication and exhibition myself, but it will be difficult for me to finance my attendance for a couple of days in New York
You could help me finance my stay in New York to be phycically present at the exhibition.
This is something that is very important to me and really a dream come true.
   
                     Longing Worlds: Voyage to the beauty of nature

 
         What would you fund and what will you get in return
                                      Funding:
-The return flight from Amsterdam airport to New York.
-The stay in a middle class hotel.
All funding will go to the trip, even if I don’t make it to my goal. All money is welcome.
All extra funding will go to the transportation of my art to NY (this costs about 500 euro, incl. insurance).
 
                                      In return:
A lot of gratitude and of course the perks!
If I succeed in achieving my goal:
I will create an exclusive artwork for one of the donators. The selected person will receive a high resolution file of the creation.
This only applies when more than 10 people have contributed.
 
                             What It means to me

I can ship all of my works to New York and watch all the photo’s of the exhibition in my little room in Holland afterwards, but I rather be physically a part of this wonderful adventure.
I would love to have the ability to actually talk about my work to the visitors in the gallery and be able to network with the people from the industry.
It’s eventually a great way to expand my career and It would be a great reward for all the hard work and passion I’ve put in my art so far.
                                 
                                   Spread the word
Not able to help me financially?  You are doing me a big favor by spreading the word and make people aware of my dream.
Remember to use the share tools at Indiegogo as well.
 
          Many, many thanks in advance for your support!

<p>The 2013 WALL\THERAPY event was something never before seen in Rochester. Over 30 world renown artists from across the globe came together to create unique and elegant works of art on various walls all over the city. In span of a week Rochester gained over 60 new murals in locations throughout the city, in neighborhoods including the South Wedge and near the El Camino Trail. These paintings varied in size from only a few feet long to creations over 4 stories. By the end of Fall 2013, we had 35 muralists join us in all. All of this was created thanks to financial and volunteer donations from you, our supporters.</p>
<p>We are asking again for assistance to continuing this forward momentum, to continue to bring unique artists to our city to help inspire and to heal. Your continued support will allow us to purchase the paint and supplies, rent the lifts and ladders needed to support the local and international artists as they produce visually compelling murals in the Rochester cityscape, in turn improving and strengthening our thriving community. </p>
<p><b>______________________________________________________________</b></p>
<p><b>What your donation means directly to the cause: </b></p>
<p><b>For every $15</b> you donate, we can afford an artist with 3 cans of spray paint. To show you how much that matters, we offer a set of die cut stickers to those giving $15 or more! <br/></p>
<p><b>For every $25</b> you donate the money goes for 4-5 cans of spray paint or a gallon bucket of primer </p>
<p><b>For every $50</b> that means we can purchase paint brushes, rollers, buckets and cover other supply expenses. </p>
<p><b>Donations of $150 or more</b> helps the team supply the artist with food and water as they paint their murals (wouldn't you like to be the person that helped sponsor an artist from Europe to have their first garbage plate!?)</p>
<p><b>Donations of $500 or more</b> helps us rent a mechanical lift for the week, and our artists don’t have to stand precariously on a ladder to paint their work.</p>
<p><b>Should you donate $1000,</b> that money goes directly to plane tickets and any sort of car rental needed for the artists</p>
<p><b>If you donate $5000 ,</b>you are not just solidifying WALL\THERAPY this year and becoming a producer of this event, but you will be instrumental in helping us start focusing on the humanitarian endeavor and sister initiative known as IMPACT! </p>
<p><br/><b><i>

<p>As the artists visit and help our city heal through images, they are also taking back with them the understanding of what they can do to help communities in a global fashion. As WALL\THERAPY images has helped heal our city, the artists will begin to spread the word how images can truly save lives. Our sister initiative is doing just that, utilizing imaging to improve and saves lives in developing communities. IMPACT! (IMProving Access to Care by Teleradiology), does its healing by setting up diagnostic imaging sites in developing countries. The connection between art and the medical philanthropy is imagery. Street murals enhance life. Medical X-ray imagery preserves it. </p>
<p>Both entities are housed under the Synthesis Collaborative, a 501(c)(3) public charity incorporated in New York State. The organization raises funds to set up teleradiology services within these developing communities and grow a network of volunteer radiologists around the world. These doctors use cloud computing to access images, interpret them and recommend treatment. As a result, afflictions that are commonly misdiagnosed, or missed entirely, are properly diagnosed, saving countless lives. Artists travel to these communities as well, improving life with inspirational murals. </p>

The 2013 WALL\THERAPY event was something never before seen in Rochester. Over 30 world renown artists from across the globe came together to create unique and elegant works of art on various walls all over the city. In span of a week Rochester gained over 60 new murals in locations throughout the city, in neighborhoods including the South Wedge and near the El Camino Trail. These paintings varied in size from only a few feet long to creations over 4 stories. By the end of Fall 2013, we had 35 muralists join us in all. All of this was created thanks to financial and volunteer donations from you, our supporters.
We are asking again for assistance to continuing this forward momentum, to continue to bring unique artists to our city to help inspire and to heal. Your continued support will allow us to purchase the paint and supplies, rent the lifts and ladders needed to support the local and international artists as they produce visually compelling murals in the Rochester cityscape, in turn improving and strengthening our thriving community. 
______________________________________________________________
What your donation means directly to the cause: 
For every $15 you donate, we can afford an artist with 3 cans of spray paint. To show you how much that matters, we offer a set of die cut stickers to those giving $15 or more! 
For every $25 you donate the money goes for 4-5 cans of spray paint or a gallon bucket of primer 
For every $50 that means we can purchase paint brushes, rollers, buckets and cover other supply expenses. 
Donations of $150 or more helps the team supply the artist with food and water as they paint their murals (wouldn't you like to be the person that helped sponsor an artist from Europe to have their first garbage plate!?)
Donations of $500 or more helps us rent a mechanical lift for the week, and our artists don’t have to stand precariously on a ladder to paint their work.
Should you donate $1000, that money goes directly to plane tickets and any sort of car rental needed for the artists
If you donate $5000 ,you are not just solidifying WALL\THERAPY this year and becoming a producer of this event, but you will be instrumental in helping us start focusing on the humanitarian endeavor and sister initiative known as IMPACT! 

Read below to learn more:
As the artists visit and help our city heal through images, they are also taking back with them the understanding of what they can do to help communities in a global fashion. As WALL\THERAPY images has helped heal our city, the artists will begin to spread the word how images can truly save lives. Our sister initiative is doing just that, utilizing imaging to improve and saves lives in developing communities. IMPACT! (IMProving Access to Care by Teleradiology), does its healing by setting up diagnostic imaging sites in developing countries. The connection between art and the medical philanthropy is imagery. Street murals enhance life. Medical X-ray imagery preserves it. 
Both entities are housed under the Synthesis Collaborative, a 501(c)(3) public charity incorporated in New York State. The organization raises funds to set up teleradiology services within these developing communities and grow a network of volunteer radiologists around the world. These doctors use cloud computing to access images, interpret them and recommend treatment. As a result, afflictions that are commonly misdiagnosed, or missed entirely, are properly diagnosed, saving countless lives. Artists travel to these communities as well, improving life with inspirational murals.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello to you and thanks for looking! My name is Scott. I am an artist living and working in the Telluride area. Last year, I ventured into sculpture at Burning Man, by bringing to life the Yoga Robot. Don't know what that is?? Just Google it!!</p>
<p>This year I had an idea to do something quite a bit different. The plan is to build a full scale artillery gun. With seats for two, and hand cranks that move and aim it. Except that it will be a large scale Teleidescope, which will be able to spin around with pedals. The barrel of the scope will be somewhere around 30"".There will also be a small memorial plaque with exciting details. And possibly a sentry on site from time to time.</p>
<p>A teleidescope is a kaleidescope that looks out into the world, using the field of vision to create the image.</p>
<p>The idea is that you will see a massive out of place gun sitting in the desert, and upon inspection you will find that it is a giant toy.</p>
<p>The importance of this project to me, is that I get to be a part of the Burning Man experience, rather than just a spectator. Also, I am able to make other people's visit that much more interesting and special. I feel that this event is truly one of the largest art venues available, especially in the context of showing strange and obscure art to thousands of people. Plans are also being made for exhibition and placement after the event.</p>
<p>As a donor, you get to be a part of this experience as well. You will make it possible for me to reach my goal and fulfill my vision. Creating art and bringing it to this environment is expensive and time consuming. I will not make any money doing this, I simply do it because I want it to become reality.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Building the gun, getting together vintage parts, assembly and transportation is going to get expensive. My overall budget is looking to be over $11,000. This campaign is to get things rolling, get some parts coming this way, and to get us started with construction. Future fundraising campaigns will be coming along to keep things moving. </p>
<p>Perks: There will be a few nice custom things that I will make or get made for you. These will be simple tokens of appreciation, hand made with love for the people that help make this happen.</p>
<p>While we hope to meet this goal, <strong><em>don't be shy about pushing it above and beyond</em></strong>! Even if we don't reach our goal this time around, we are still going to be lurching forwards with whatever funding we receive. Rest assured, any money donated at this time will get the ball rolling and become a part of our success.</p>

<p>This fundraiser is for the purpose of creating and donating a statue - as a true work of art - of District Judge Otis D. Wright, II in California.

<p><strong>Background story</strong></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Prenda Law is an organization that has sued thousands of people for allegedly downloading porn from the internet over the past few years.

Perhaps the first <span lang=""EN-US"">crowd funded spontaneous</span> artwork of its kind, our goal is to show the world that we - the citizens of the internet - honor Judge Wright.

<ul>
<li>Get formal permission from Judge Wright. While this is not strictly required, making a statue or work of art of a person is silly if the person involved will have no part of it. </li>

<p>People always suggest these kind of crazy ideas when something cool happens in cyberspace. Let's make it happen this time!

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you are an artist in California, please take a day or two to think about this project. How would you pay tribute to Judge Wright? Can you draw or describe your intended work of art? Your budget will be approx. 7000 USD, perhaps more if this fundraising becomes a big success.</p>
<p>If you are an honest lawyer (heh!) living in California, and you would like to help make this project a success by working pro-bono then please contact me. There is plenty of work to be done, such as handling the donations in a proper manner and paying a local artist in compliance with local laws. Having a local pro-bono lawyer would be a great help.</p>
<p><strong>Exces Funding</strong></p>
<p>Funding above the intended goal will go to a better, bigger or more impressive (and thereby more expensive) piece of art. Should the amount reach ludicrous levels the excess funding will be donated to the EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation, whose work is very much in the same spirit as Judge Wrights has demonstrated in the Prenda case.</p>
<p><strong>If we don't reach our goal</strong></p>
<p>Should we be unable to raise our goal of 7000 USD we will reevaluate the situation. The first move will be to look for artists willing to make a work within the budget available to us. Failing that we will contact donaters and offer them the option of either a refund or transfering their donation to the EFF - Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>

Background story
Prenda Law is an organization that has sued thousands of people for allegedly downloading porn from the internet over the past few years.

Pay a few thousand dollars to make the problem go away, or face the embarrassment and costs of defending yourself in a porn-related case in court.
Recently one of their cases fell apart and a federal judge began asking tough questions. The organization has been in collapse ever since. Technology News site Ars Technica has covered most of the story, which finally culminated when Judge Wright officially asked for a criminal investigation.
The final order from Judge Wright has attracted much attention, not only because of his rulings but also because of his widespread use of humor and Sci-Fi references (mainly StarTrek).
This campaign seeks to raise funds to make an original work of art, for example a statue, of Judge Otis D. Wright.

<p>Rachel Timmins (Baltimore, MD) and Jillian Moore (Iowa City, IA) are two makers who have curated a group of emerging American art jewelers who they believe collectively demonstrate the wide range of work that the US has to offer today in this field.  This group will go to SIERAAD, an international art jewelry fair in Amsterdam (November 2013).  Rachel, Jillian and their curated group:  Katja Toporski, April Wood, Laura Wood, Elizabeth Steiner, Satomi Kawai, Katie Poterala, Rebekah Frank and Stephanie Voegele have all earned their MFA degrees at various universities across the United States and have been active participants in the art jewelry community, exhibiting at venues both nationally and internationally.  </p>
<p>By exhibiting at <a href=""http://www.sieraadartfair.com/cms/?lang=en"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">SIERAAD</a>, we hope to further connect the European jewelry community and its corresponding market with that of the United States. This promotion of community will help the individual makers in our group foster connections that will ripple out beyond the confines of this singular event.  It will also give galleries and buyers overseas a fresh look at the diverse range of jewelry that is happening in America due to the nature of our carefully selected group. We want to be better connected: not just through the internet - but in real life, real space, and real time. Your donation can help our ten-person group to cover our costs, and also help to foster much needed growth in the international art jewelry community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As a group, each of us has already individually signed a contract with SIERAAD, committing to do the show and to pay for the cost of our booth.  In fact, SIERAAD has already started to promote this year's show with some of our images! Regardless of funding, WE ARE GOING!  Our SIERAAD booth costs about $7,500 USD once necessary additions are factored in due to the size of our group. Funding will mean that an enormous group such as ours, made entirely of emerging makers with limited resources, can afford to do this show properly.  All proceeds from this fundraising will go towards paying for our 21 square meter booth - the booth fee, and the accompanying booth furniture.  </p>
<p>In return for your donations, we are happy to offer a variety of rewards!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, all the proceeds that we do make will still go to covering our booth costs.  What is left over will need to be covered by the individuals in our group. </p>
<p>Should we find ourselves fortunate enough to exceed our goal of $7500, all further funding will go toward travel, lodging, and other necessary expenses incurred by our group.</p>
</div>

<p>We feel that going to SIERAAD is necessary for our individual careers as it will foster relationships with international gallerists and buyers but it is also necessary in helping to grow and connect the art jewelry community.  We really need this.  Our community needs this.  </p>

<p>Similar to others who lived in Ethiopia in the 80s, I have been nomadic since. This has led to many interesting things in my life: four academic degrees in journalism, international studies, anthropology and media and cultural studies. I have filmed street dogs in India, gate-crashed climate change conferences and worked on community art projects in places that I do not belong to. I have worked on experimental films in holy cities and struggled to take photography in faraway places just for the pleasure of seeing something beautiful. </p>
<p>It all confuses me very much too. </p><p>But despite all this, I still keep on coming back to my memories of Ethiopia. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Consider the following story: </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In 1984, one of the worst famines in human history took place. An estimated four million people died of hunger. A tidal wave of compassion emerged as emotional images were streamed live across the world on television screens, and as Live Aid provided the soundtrack to the human tragedy: </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""We are the world, we are the children ..."" </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Living in Ethiopia at the time, I also vaguely remember this time. I was 8 or 9 years old then.  In one of these memories, I am in the dusty heartlands of this famine in Northern Ethiopia. I remember a scene where we walk past a bridge with stick figure people. Our local guide tells us: “</span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">These people will not be here in the morning … the hyenas will get them.</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">” </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In the morning the streets were empty. </span><br/></p>
<p>There are many more memories like this. Yet these memories have been coloured by time and my over-active imagination. Memories have become stories and, after many years, I am not always sure what happened and what I have supplemented to fill in the dots of this surreal narrative. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Now I have a daughter. How do I tell such stories to her when she grows up? How does one best explain the sometimes cruel beauty of human existence? How does one explain growing up in extraordinary circumstances that, nonetheless, seemed so ordinary to anybody who lived through them? </span></p>
<p><b>Injera Westerns</b> is how.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196516/files/20131113233104-what_is_IW.jpg?1384414264"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Injera Westerns** </b>is an art project based on memories of people who grew up in Ethiopia in the 1980s. Yes, this was a time of great famine, civil war, Red Terror, and a Stalinist dictatorship and other not-so-nice things. But, as importantly, this was also a time of growing up, lasting friendship, first kisses, heartbreaks, wild parties and other such life-changing events. <i>Time to put down our soul roots as one participant put it. </i> <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Based on these memories, I want to produce an experimental art book that combines fictionalised coming-of-age stories of children and young people with the more sinister political backdrop of this turbulent period in Ethiopian history. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why do I want to do this?</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I think the untold truth of our lives is simply stranger, more poetic and more surreal than any fiction I have read or any movie I have seen. These stories need to be now heard as widely as possible. <b>Moreover, these stories are not about Ethiopia only but touch on universal themes everybody can relate to in their humane laughter and sorrow.</b></span></p>
<p>The book revolves around the core question of <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">how does one explain the less pleasant side of life - such as human suffering - to my daughter when she grows up? </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In an effort t</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">o do this impossible task, the book creates the mythical world of <b>Injera Westerns </b>that freely combines different visual and textual styles from old </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">propaganda posters, Italian spaghetti western movies, popular culture, critical media theory, existential philosophy, Ethiopian church paintings, comics, children's books, oral history, surrealism, political theory and much much more. These elements are then pulled together with my original design work, photography, watercolour, ink sketches, paintings and writing.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Does this all sound a bit complex?  Well it is.  But I sincerely believe that this is the only honest way I am able to tell the story I want to tell. At least in this book - my sincere hope is - I will be able to shatter some of the simplistic cliches and stereotypes that still plague Western representations of countries such as Ethiopia.  <br/></span></p>
<p>Below are a few illustrative examples that provide an idea about I am talking about (though the final book will be quite different in form and content):</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196524/files/20131113233342-2013_10_03_IW.jpg?1384414422"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196520/files/20131113233154-2013_09_07_injerawesterns_small.jpg?1384414314"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">** The title Injera Western, by the way, is an homage to Italian Spaghetti Westerns movies. Injera is to Ethiopia as what spaghetti is to Italy.</span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196526/files/20131113233639-pilgrimage.jpg?1384414599"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>How does Injera Westerns work?</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The first phase </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">consisted of a digital storytelling experiment that took place on an invite-only Facebook group. Over 6 months almost 500 people who had lived in Ethiopia in the 1980s discussed and shared their warm, funny and sometimes painful memories of growing up in Ethiopia.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>The second phase </b>now aims to use these stories, and many others I have, to produce a beautiful art book. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">But in order to get all the necessary visual and textual material for the book I need to travel back to Ethiopia. Moreover, what I want to do now is carry out a <b>mythical</b></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b> journey in the high mountains of Ethiopia</b> where I will reminisce over these stories, a kind of</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">pilgrimage </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">during which I meditate on who I have become and what these stories mean for me. During this pilgrimage I will then capture the material needed to make this book what it deserves to be: photography, sketches, paintings, and all other visual material that is still needed.  </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I will follow the following route over 20 days:</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196527/files/20131113233718-2013_10_25_map_b.jpg?1384414638"" src="""" style=""width: 568.6574074074074px; height: 865px;""/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you wonder why I need to go all the way to the Ethiopian mountains for this, I hope the following picture will explain why the book simply cannot be done without this </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">majestic landscape forming the existential backdrop for the Injera Westerns stories.</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196563/files/20131114002231-149666_10150304677880459_634635_n.jpg?1384417351"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196565/files/20131114002315-what_is_needed.jpg?1384417395"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To make this possible, however, I need to fundraise a bit.  <b>This is where I need your help and why I have come to Indiegogo hat in hand for the first time.</b> I need to raise enough funds to cover my costs of traveling to Ethiopia, to organise this pilgrimage in the mountains, as well as for the costs of producing the book professionally.  In particular, I hope to fundraise the following amounts:</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196579/files/20131114004445-2013_10_25_costs.jpg?1384418685"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p></p><p>My initial fundraising target is thus 7,500 EUR.  <b>Without this nothing will happen.  </b>In other words, the book cannot be done without this amount. Any additional money that is then raised will be then used for the following additional purposes:</p>

This has led to many interesting things in my life: four academic degrees in journalism, international studies, anthropology and media and cultural studies. I have filmed street dogs in India, gate-crashed climate change conferences and worked on community art projects in places that I do not belong to. I have worked on experimental films in holy cities and struggled to take photography in faraway places just for the pleasure of seeing something beautiful. 
It all confuses me very much too. But despite all this, I still keep on coming back to my memories of Ethiopia. Consider the following story: In 1984, one of the worst famines in human history took place. An estimated four million people died of hunger. A tidal wave of compassion emerged as emotional images were streamed live across the world on television screens, and as Live Aid provided the soundtrack to the human tragedy: ""We are the world, we are the children ..."" Living in Ethiopia at the time, I also vaguely remember this time. I was 8 or 9 years old then.  In one of these memories, I am in the dusty heartlands of this famine in Northern Ethiopia. I remember a scene where we walk past a bridge with stick figure people. Our local guide tells us: “These people will not be here in the morning … the hyenas will get them.” In the morning the streets were empty. 
There are many more memories like this. Yet these memories have been coloured by time and my over-active imagination. Memories have become stories and, after many years, I am not always sure what happened and what I have supplemented to fill in the dots of this surreal narrative. Now I have a daughter. How do I tell such stories to her when she grows up? How does one best explain the sometimes cruel beauty of human existence? How does one explain growing up in extraordinary circumstances that, nonetheless, seemed so ordinary to anybody who lived through them? 
Injera Westerns is how.
Injera Westerns** is an art project based on memories of people who grew up in Ethiopia in the 1980s. Yes, this was a time of great famine, civil war, Red Terror, and a Stalinist dictatorship and other not-so-nice things. But, as importantly, this was also a time of growing up, lasting friendship, first kisses, heartbreaks, wild parties and other such life-changing events. Time to put down our soul roots as one participant put it.  Based on these memories, I want to produce an experimental art book that combines fictionalised coming-of-age stories of children and young people with the more sinister political backdrop of this turbulent period in Ethiopian history. Why do I want to do this?I think the untold truth of our lives is simply stranger, more poetic and more surreal than any fiction I have read or any movie I have seen. These stories need to be now heard as widely as possible. Moreover, these stories are not about Ethiopia only but touch on universal themes everybody can relate to in their humane laughter and sorrow.
The book revolves around the core question of  how does one explain the less pleasant side of life - such as human suffering - to my daughter when she grows up? In an effort to do this impossible task, the book creates the mythical world of Injera Westerns that freely combines different visual and textual styles from old propaganda posters, Italian spaghetti western movies, popular culture, critical media theory, existential philosophy, Ethiopian church paintings, comics, children's books, oral history, surrealism, political theory and much much more. These elements are then pulled together with my original design work, photography, watercolour, ink sketches, paintings and writing.Does this all sound a bit complex?  Well it is.  But I sincerely believe that this is the only honest way I am able to tell the story I want to tell. At least in this book - my sincere hope is - I will be able to shatter some of the simplistic cliches and stereotypes that still plague Western representations of countries such as Ethiopia.  
Below are a few illustrative examples that provide an idea about I am talking about (though the final book will be quite different in form and content):
** The title Injera Western, by the way, is an homage to Italian Spaghetti Westerns movies. Injera is to Ethiopia as what spaghetti is to Italy.How does Injera Westerns work?The first phase consisted of a digital storytelling experiment that took place on an invite-only Facebook group. Over 6 months almost 500 people who had lived in Ethiopia in the 1980s discussed and shared their warm, funny and sometimes painful memories of growing up in Ethiopia.
The second phase now aims to use these stories, and many others I have, to produce a beautiful art book. But in order to get all the necessary visual and textual material for the book I need to travel back to Ethiopia. Moreover, what I want to do now is carry out a mythical journey in the high mountains of Ethiopia where I will reminisce over these stories, a kind of pilgrimage during which I meditate on who I have become and what these stories mean for me. During this pilgrimage I will then capture the material needed to make this book what it deserves to be: photography, sketches, paintings, and all other visual material that is still needed.  I will follow the following route over 20 days:If you wonder why I need to go all the way to the Ethiopian mountains for this, I hope the following picture will explain why the book simply cannot be done without this majestic landscape forming the existential backdrop for the Injera Westerns stories.
To make this possible, however, I need to fundraise a bit.  This is where I need your help and why I have come to Indiegogo hat in hand for the first time. I need to raise enough funds to cover my costs of traveling to Ethiopia, to organise this pilgrimage in the mountains, as well as for the costs of producing the book professionally.  In particular, I hope to fundraise the following amounts:My initial fundraising target is thus 7,500 EUR.  Without this nothing will happen.  In other words, the book cannot be done without this amount. Any additional money that is then raised will be then used for the following additional purposes:
1. 7500-12500: to organise a touring art exhibition based on the visual-textual material of the book;
2. 12500-17500: to continue research on this project and write a more classical oral history book based on these stories hopefully published by a publisher; 
3. 17500 - ?: Money above this will be used to launch an Injera Westerns foundation to support organisations in Ethiopia that combine artistic and social work in innovative ways.  We have identified one project we would love to help out.The good thing about all this is that you can also benefit from my crazy idea!  In order to help you support this project, I have created a wide selections of perks aimed at giving you something nice in return. These range from postcards, posters, electronic versions and  signed copies of my book to original photography, sketches and paintings produced during this trip.
My aim here is not to get rich; simply to get this important book done. These perks are intended to give you different kinds of incentives and pathways that can potentially make this book possible with your help. I will naturally offer additional perks over the duration of the fundraising project - and before Christmas - so please do also come back here often and see how this experiment continues.Please check the list on the right for the different perks that I am offering as well as the visual breakdown of the perks below.

The biggest opportunity for artists to meet the public and show their work is the last weekend of each month for Final Fridays and Second Look Saturdays. I get my keys October 1st, which only gives me 3.5 weeks to get the studio ready for its Final Friday/Second Look Saturday debut! This is where I need your help!


This studio is an early stage---one stair step---for ARTsonality! Eventually, I'd love to have a storefront space that's entirely community-focused, but without clientele and referrals, it would fail. This is why a well-put-together studio space is crucial to ARTsonality's success! (Also, since female entrepreneurs aren't taken nearly as seriously as male entrepreneurs, this would make a storefront space that much more difficult without a middle step.) 
Bottom line: I am taking a big, creative, entrepreneurial plunge and I'd LOVE for you to be a part of it!

<p></p>
<p>Nitrocellulose (also: cellulose
nitrate, flash paper, flash cotton, guncotton, flash
string) is a highly flammable compound formed by nitratingcellulose
through exposure to nitric acid or other powerful nitrating agent. When
used as a propellant or low-order explosive, it was
originally known as guncotton.</p>
<h3>The dream</h3>
<p>At
times it happens that a dream comes true in the most unpredictable ways.  That is what is happening to Virginia
Bettinelli, author of “Fulmicotone”, a book that has had great success among
its online readers, a book that has not been marred by the logic of a lazy and
greedy editorial market.  The book,
selected for the LA GIARA prize in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region of Italy,
characterized by its disruptive sense of freedom that characterizes the work as
well as its author, is free of the contractual obligations of a publisher.  The book, independently published, was sold
out after its first printing.  It is now
available on line in the form of an e-book. 
It consists of 36 stories describing the life of a family and our

</div></div>","What's Fulmicotone about?
Life. It's only life.There are muddled lives that never manage
to undo those knots formed even earlier than the umbilical
cord. Sad, rather unlucky lives, for which the
wheel never seems to turn. Angry lives, shaky lives, short, broken
lives, that in turn gave life though.Once I saw a yellow butterfly seal its fate,
flying and uncertainly fluttering its wings just a few centimetres
from the asphalt, scorching in the Summer; I thought
risk is exciting, though free flight is less insidious.The yellow of the butterfly’s wings, stark
against the black, scorching of asphalt, switched on in my mind the
full, indelible awareness of the infinite, divine quantity of beauty that
exists in the world.


What's Fulmicotone?



Nitrocellulose (also: cellulose
nitrate, flash paper, flash cotton, guncotton, flash
string) is a highly flammable compound formed by nitratingcellulose
through exposure to nitric acid or other powerful nitrating agent. When
used as a propellant or low-order explosive, it was
originally known as guncotton.
The dream
At
times it happens that a dream comes true in the most unpredictable ways.  That is what is happening to Virginia
Bettinelli, author of “Fulmicotone”, a book that has had great success among
its online readers, a book that has not been marred by the logic of a lazy and
greedy editorial market.  The book,
selected for the LA GIARA prize in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region of Italy,
characterized by its disruptive sense of freedom that characterizes the work as
well as its author, is free of the contractual obligations of a publisher.  The book, independently published, was sold
out after its first printing.  It is now
available on line in the form of an e-book. 
It consists of 36 stories describing the life of a family and our
Northeastern region from the 1970s to today.
Fulmicotone
– says the author – is explosive, and the book has had that same effect on me
and on those who read it.  It was written
from an almost impassioned necessity - that of freeing all of the tangled knots
that haunted the author through the years. 
Fulmicotone brings to light a world that overwhelms the reader.  Bettinelli has a writing style that is
immediate, direct, a perpetual balance between the written language, rich with
musical citations, and the ebook version that has a warm soundtrack and images
that are raw, crude and piercing.  
The
plot follows the narrator as a girl come woman who tells the tale of a father
who is excessive in all senses, from whom one must escape, but inevitably will
return to for a sort of inexplicable, fascinating, visceral contradiction that
is he.
“I

Contemporary Dance Projects (Kemi) is a not-for-profit dance company with Jennifer
Dallas, founder and artistic director, at the helm.</span></p>
<p>September
18-21, 2013 at the Winchester Street Theatre in Toronto, Canada Kemi presents its
third full-length evening of dance entitled<i> <b>Stages</b></i>. The production includes 2 premieres: <i>Time Now,</i> a trio for 3 women by Jennifer Dallas, and <i>Thirst </i>by Tedd Robinson, a duet for
Michael Caldwell and Jennifer Dallas. </p>
<p>The seed for <b><i>Time Now</i></b> came from Jennifer’s interest in Duke Ellington’s Big
Band music and in women of the 1920s. The work has evolved as a broad study of women.
Empowerment, feminine unity, women’s place in social structure, the female
silhouette, sexuality and language were all of interest to Jennifer in the
creation of <i>Time Now. </i>Ultimately in <i>Time Now</i> the relationships between the 3 dancers reveal feminine power. The dance is set to an
original score by three-time Canadian Juno nominee Elizabeth Shepherd and recorded
at the Glenn Gould Studio by renowned recording engineer John MacLean.</p>

<p><i><b>Stages</b> </i>celebrates the work of emerging
and established dance artists and musicians. For the artists involved it has been an
opportunity to create, connect and learn with some of Canada’s most inquisitive
and compelling performing artists. For the audience that fills the seats <i><b>Stages</b> </i>it is an opportunity to see the
fruits of artistic labour, to be transported through the imagination,
questioned, challenged, touched and inspired. </p>
<p><i>""An increasingly virtual
culture has altered our understanding of ourselves, our bodies, our
relationships and our responsibilities. Dance helps to remind, reflect and
reconnect audiences by engaging the shared vessel of the human
body. For K</i><i>e</i><i>mi, the dance studio/stage is where human interaction can enjoy the
beauty and freedom of transcending age, race and experience.” </i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">– </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Jennifer

<p>We are 4-weeks away from opening night! Arts funding has been decided and while we are so grateful for the creation funding received from the Toronto Arts Council in 2011 for <i>Time Now</i>, the fact remains that we have not received any funding for the production of <i>Stages</i>. </p>
<p>Dear friends, admirers and wonderers, we need your help. </p>
<p>Funds from this campaign will first and foremost go to THE ARTISTS, fees for their time, expertise and brilliant work. The expenses of self-presented dance are vast and include the following: rehearsal studio space, theatre rental, lighting design, costuming and set design, materials and construction, technical staff, publicity, documentation (video and photography) and administrative staff.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal we will have to cut back on production expenses and artists will receive a less than ideal fee. If we EXCEED our goal, however, we'll be able to more fairly compensate our team AND increase our marketing and audience reach, bringing <i>Stages</i> to even more people!</p>
<p>By contributing to <i>Stages</i>, in addition to the warm satisfaction of supporting dance art, you will receive a unique perk from Kemi. Among other things we have a collection of cloth from West Africa, music from the show, photographs from the studio, and knitted wear to keep your ankles cozy among other charming things. Check out your choices in the column on the right!</p></span><p></p>

About Stages 

Kemi
Contemporary Dance Projects (Kemi) is a not-for-profit dance company with Jennifer
Dallas, founder and artistic director, at the helm.
September
18-21, 2013 at the Winchester Street Theatre in Toronto, Canada Kemi presents its
third full-length evening of dance entitled Stages. The production includes 2 premieres: Time Now, a trio for 3 women by Jennifer Dallas, and Thirst by Tedd Robinson, a duet for
Michael Caldwell and Jennifer Dallas. 
The seed for Time Now came from Jennifer’s interest in Duke Ellington’s Big
Band music and in women of the 1920s. The work has evolved as a broad study of women.
Empowerment, feminine unity, women’s place in social structure, the female
silhouette, sexuality and language were all of interest to Jennifer in the
creation of Time Now. Ultimately in Time Now the relationships between the 3 dancers reveal feminine power. The dance is set to an
original score by three-time Canadian Juno nominee Elizabeth Shepherd and recorded
at the Glenn Gould Studio by renowned recording engineer John MacLean.

Thirst brings together seasoned and celebrated artist Tedd Robinson as choreographer, mid-career artists Michael Caldwell and Jennifer Dallas as dancers, and Quebec sensation Charles Quevillon as composer. Tedd Robinson’s work is challenging for the performer and inviting to the audience; it reveals truths of humanity though candour and humour.
Thirst is a work that flowed out of us naturally, with the weight of a desert dune. – Tedd Robinson

What We Need and What You Get
The Impact
Stages celebrates the work of emerging
and established dance artists and musicians. For the artists involved it has been an
opportunity to create, connect and learn with some of Canada’s most inquisitive
and compelling performing artists. For the audience that fills the seats Stages it is an opportunity to see the
fruits of artistic labour, to be transported through the imagination,
questioned, challenged, touched and inspired. 
""An increasingly virtual
culture has altered our understanding of ourselves, our bodies, our
relationships and our responsibilities. Dance helps to remind, reflect and
reconnect audiences by engaging the shared vessel of the human
body. For Kemi, the dance studio/stage is where human interaction can enjoy the
beauty and freedom of transcending age, race and experience.” – Jennifer
Dallas 

We are 4-weeks away from opening night! Arts funding has been decided and while we are so grateful for the creation funding received from the Toronto Arts Council in 2011 for Time Now, the fact remains that we have not received any funding for the production of Stages. 
Dear friends, admirers and wonderers, we need your help. 
Funds from this campaign will first and foremost go to THE ARTISTS, fees for their time, expertise and brilliant work. The expenses of self-presented dance are vast and include the following: rehearsal studio space, theatre rental, lighting design, costuming and set design, materials and construction, technical staff, publicity, documentation (video and photography) and administrative staff.
If we don’t reach our goal we will have to cut back on production expenses and artists will receive a less than ideal fee. If we EXCEED our goal, however, we'll be able to more fairly compensate our team AND increase our marketing and audience reach, bringing Stages to even more people!
By contributing to Stages, in addition to the warm satisfaction of supporting dance art, you will receive a unique perk from Kemi. Among other things we have a collection of cloth from West Africa, music from the show, photographs from the studio, and knitted wear to keep your ankles cozy among other charming things. Check out your choices in the column on the right!

Other Ways You Can Help
Come to the show!
Most
importantly we want our work to be seen! Come see Stages and tell your friends and community
about it. Bring someone who adores contemporary dance or jazz music, or someone who has never been to dance show before – take a chance!

<p><em><b>Support the Arts – Help Us Go Digital</b></em></p>
<p><b>Your help is needed for industry mandated digital cinema conversion</b></p>
<p>For nearly 75 years the Fine Arts Theatre Place in Maynard has been a staple of the regional community, providing residents and families with access to some of the world’s most popular motion pictures. But this year, our small town theatre is faced with an unprecedented challenge – the film industry’s mandated January 1, 2014 conversion from the traditional 35mm film to digital projection. Though this transformation will maintain the theatre’s ability to bring first-run movies, it also requires substantial costs, which is why the Fine Arts Theatre Place has launched the“Support the Arts – Help Us Go Digital” campaign.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/867063/files/20140918154800-arts.jpg?1411080480"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>This campaign has set a fundraising goal of $200,000, which will cover the cost of new projection equipment, computers and a sound system necessary to support the digital format. The film industry has used 35mm film since it first launched in 1910, but it is now making the transition to digital projection. New movies will cease being released on 35mm film by the end of 2013, meaning that theatres must have the updated equipment to show new films.</p>
<p><a href=""http://fineartstheatreplace.com/press/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Since purchasing the Fine Arts Theatre Place last April</a>, new owners, Steve Trumble and his business partner and Maynard resident Melanie Perry, have breathed new life back into the theatre investing more $500,000 in restoration efforts.</p>
<p>With the budget depleted, the theatre needs the strong support from the community for the new “Help Us Go Digital” campaign.

Your help is needed for industry mandated digital cinema conversion
For nearly 75 years the Fine Arts Theatre Place in Maynard has been a staple of the regional community, providing residents and families with access to some of the world’s most popular motion pictures. But this year, our small town theatre is faced with an unprecedented challenge – the film industry’s mandated January 1, 2014 conversion from the traditional 35mm film to digital projection. Though this transformation will maintain the theatre’s ability to bring first-run movies, it also requires substantial costs, which is why the Fine Arts Theatre Place has launched the“Support the Arts – Help Us Go Digital” campaign.


This campaign has set a fundraising goal of $200,000, which will cover the cost of new projection equipment, computers and a sound system necessary to support the digital format. The film industry has used 35mm film since it first launched in 1910, but it is now making the transition to digital projection. New movies will cease being released on 35mm film by the end of 2013, meaning that theatres must have the updated equipment to show new films.
Since purchasing the Fine Arts Theatre Place last April, new owners, Steve Trumble and his business partner and Maynard resident Melanie Perry, have breathed new life back into the theatre investing more $500,000 in restoration efforts.
With the budget depleted, the theatre needs the strong support from the community for the new “Help Us Go Digital” campaign. This is an opportunity for residents and community and business leaders to make a direct and sustained investment in this community and to help ensure the future of this local historic gem.

 It's always been that way but these days Bio-Art is fashionable which is great for me because my research-led art practice is all about biology.  I'm a grad student in my final year of a fine art program so without classes to attend I've fallen in love with a plan to trek to NYC to take a class at the School of Visual Art. The class is called Biological Imaging: The Use of Microscopy to Observe and Photograph Life. Which is right up my alley.

Coincidentally during the same time in NYC the SVA is hosting a three day international conference called Naturally Hypernatural: Visions of Nature with visiting bio artists from around the world. Which is fantastic luck for me.

Also in November Genspace, NYC's public biolab is offering a class on Synthetic Biology which fits in with my bio art practice perfectly.

AND the New York Science Center is displaying an exhibit of Art inspired by Science, Particularly the brain. (Did I mention that my thesis is an art project about how our brains work?)

This expedition will be invaluable to my practice and career as an artist and residency director. 

I'm going to do this on a shoestring because I don't have any student loans, grants or funding of any kind apart from what I raise here so please consider purchasing a print.  I'm asking for $1000 to cover tuition at the SVA ($210) and Genspace ($300), The Naturally Hypernatural Conference ($25), bus and train fare from Ottawa ($225), NYC metro pass ($112), and accommodation (I'll mostly be couch surfing but don't want to arrive empty handed). And the printing/postage of the work sold in this campaign.


NEW PERK! NYC under a microscope postcard! I've been photographing NYC under a microscope and the results are beautiful. I'll send you one as a thank you for donating $10 to my campaign. You can choose which one you like here. Just say which one you want right on the photo, I'll print it up on a dye sublimation printer and pop it in the mail. 



Since this is an underwater themed research project and I am a printmaker I am offering marine-life related prints to my supporters.

For 35 years, Nightwood Theatre has been Canada’s national
woman’s theatre. We have been helping women develop their skills, get their
foot in the door in Canadian theatre, and forge creative alliances among women
in the arts.  We produce shows, mentor artists, and
advocate. We’ve become something like a home for Canadian women in theatre.
At the heart of our work is a belief in the
power of what women bring to the world through theatre. Our work is cut out for
us:


72% of theatres in Canada are run by
men.


Of the 1006 credited playwrights
produced in Canada in 2010 only 288 were women. That is only 29%.

Only 33% of the plays produced are
directed by women. 
There’s an equity gap, a big one. And it doesn’t
make sense. Women have so much more to say. 10,000 WOMEN CAMPAIGNWith
our 10,000 Women Campaign, we are giving you the chance to tell one woman that she matters to you by contributing just
$10. An opportunity to tell us her name, share
her story, honour her.Through this campaign we will gather 10,000
names, and 10,000 stories. But today we have a smaller goal. We’re asking you
to help us gather 600 names by July 15.  When we hit our goal of 10,000 names, we will recognize these remarkable women with a groundbreaking art exhibit. In the meantime:

<p><b>Fin dalla sua
nascita, avvenuta nel 2011</b>, ALTO FEST <span>è dimora per pratiche d'arte
innovative e condivise; abbattere ogni muro possibile tra spettatore e scena,
seminare bellezza, far fiorire orizzonti, camminare lo stupore. In 4 anni
abbiamo dedicato alla città il nostro tempo, i nostri soldi, le
nostre competenze e conoscenze. Lo abbiamo fatto non solo perché la cultura è
il nostro lavoro, ma perché prima di tutto noi stessi siamo spettatori curiosi,
affamati di coraggio e innovazione, e non vogliamo più sentirci isolati dai
movimenti culturali internazionali, prendere treni e macinare chilometri per
vedere e godere di opere che in nessun modo arriveranno qui, dove abitiamo.
Abbiamo coltivato questo progetto, contenti della fatica, insieme ai tanti
cittadini che ci hanno donato i loro appartamenti, negozi, giardini, spazi
d'ogni sorta, che hanno accolto artisti provenienti da terre lontane, che a
loro volta hanno condiviso con gli spettatori opere d'arte coraggiose e
innovative, portando a Napoli la voce della cultura contemporanea
internazionale. Anche quest’anno, dal 22 al 28 settembre 2014, Napoli sarà casa
per artisti che arriveranno da tutto il mondo. Ancora una volta i cittadini
ospiteranno gli spettacoli nei loro spazi domestici. La Rete Ospitale si
comporrà di nuove persone che doneranno gratuitamente i loro alloggi agli artisti e ai
volontari che arriveranno da ogni dove per animare le giornate di ALTO FEST.<span><br/></span> </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687906/files/20140701132109-DSC_8187.jpg?1404246069"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

<h3>Hey guys! thank you for looking at my campaign. My name is Rose and im 19, I have just finished a three year college course and I am now looking to kick start my career. I love to draw and I'm especially passionate about design. I'm trying my best to make an income out of selling my tattoo designs but I need a little help! :)</h3>
<p>My campaign is to raise money to get some decent drawing materials and equipment so i can produce work that's up to a high standard for selling.</p>
<p>This campaign is also to help me get noticed by the puplic so I can find people I can design for.</p>
<p>Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve. </p>
<p>For me, this is as much about reaching an audience for my art work as it is about raising funds to puchase the art matericals I require. At the moment, the only people that know about my designs are close family and friends, so having people help me spread the word even if they're not able to put money in will help me out so much and I'll be so gratful!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need and what you get.</h3>
<p>The money I hope to raise will be spent on art materials such as Prismacolours. I researched into these and they seem to be the best for what I want to do and i found a kit that has 150 pencils! Unfortunately, these are very expensive but apparently worth the money! The rest of the money will be spend on decent art books, drawing pads, pencils, and quality pens. At the moment Ionly have really cheap equipment that doesn't work very well.</p>
<p>THE PERKS! as a thank you reward, I will be offering customised tattoo designs or anything of that nature! Ranging from outlines to big coloured in drawings! all my work can be emailed over to you or posted on your facebook wall or any other social networking site so all your friends know what a great help you have been :)</p>
<p>If i dont raise all the money I'll just have to buy what i can out of it and just continue to save up, hopefully out of this though, I will have at least gained a little publicity for my designs.</p>
<p>So even if you can't donate i would very VERY much appreciate you spreading the word! :)</p>
<p>Thank you for checking out my campaign</p>
<p>Wish me luck! :) xXx</p>

</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are Oscar and Dienke, and we are planning to make a big journey around the world with our four children aged 9, 8, 5 and 4 years old. While we are on the road we will teach children how to make art with our ""Make Factory"". The Make Factory teaches children that almost any idea can be used to turn into a work of art, an invention or a project. Even if it may look crazy at first!</p>
<p>Art has no boundaries and there is no ""truth"" that needs to be proven. It is all about personal experience and that makes it a very usefull tool to teach children almost anything. And to teach them how you can just change your everyday way of looking at things by stepping into the world of art. In the Make Factory children learn how to develop ideas and think of solutions rather than the bounderies.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands the Make Factory has been around for a while, and several children that participated in it have won awards with their works. Now the Make Factory is going on tour. If you want to learn more about the Make Factory (or join one!) please visit <a href=""http://www.dienkegroenhout.nl/en/category/kids"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.dienkegroenhout.nl/en/category/kids</a></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To make our trip possible, we will need 25,000 euro<br/><br/>During our trip we will draw all of our adventures and experiences with the Make Factory children. They will not just be simple drawings but mixed with collages, pictures, tape or even animations. In any way, the results will always be surprising and inspiring! When we made it all around the world, we will put together all of our drawings and pieces of art in a beautiful book!</p>
<p>Do you want to follow our drawn adventures? And help us to sent the Make Factory on tour?</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Many things in life seem obvious, inevitable, unchangeable. But by taking distance and overseeing the whole thing from a different point of view it suddenly becomes clear that it can also be different. Taking this distance and seeing opportunities is an important element of the Make Factory. By participating even with a small amount you contribute for yourself and for others that this is not forgotten.</p>
<h3>Finally</h3>
<p>By liking our project and sharing it through social media you help us tremendously, simply because we will then reach a large group of potential supporters. Thank you!</p>

Tenslotte
Door ons project te liken en te delen via de sociale media worden we ook al enorm geholpen, simpelweg omdat we daarmee een grote groep potentiele supporters kunnen bereiken. Bedankt!
 

ENGLISH VERSION


Summary



We are Oscar and Dienke, and we are planning to make a big journey around the world with our four children aged 9, 8, 5 and 4 years old. While we are on the road we will teach children how to make art with our ""Make Factory"". The Make Factory teaches children that almost any idea can be used to turn into a work of art, an invention or a project. Even if it may look crazy at first!
Art has no boundaries and there is no ""truth"" that needs to be proven. It is all about personal experience and that makes it a very usefull tool to teach children almost anything. And to teach them how you can just change your everyday way of looking at things by stepping into the world of art. In the Make Factory children learn how to develop ideas and think of solutions rather than the bounderies.
In the Netherlands the Make Factory has been around for a while, and several children that participated in it have won awards with their works. Now the Make Factory is going on tour. If you want to learn more about the Make Factory (or join one!) please visit www.dienkegroenhout.nl/en/category/kids
What We Need & What You Get



To make our trip possible, we will need 25,000 euroDuring our trip we will draw all of our adventures and experiences with the Make Factory children. They will not just be simple drawings but mixed with collages, pictures, tape or even animations. In any way, the results will always be surprising and inspiring! When we made it all around the world, we will put together all of our drawings and pieces of art in a beautiful book!
Do you want to follow our drawn adventures? And help us to sent the Make Factory on tour?
Background
Many things in life seem obvious, inevitable, unchangeable. But by taking distance and overseeing the whole thing from a different point of view it suddenly becomes clear that it can also be different. Taking this distance and seeing opportunities is an important element of the Make Factory. By participating even with a small amount you contribute for yourself and for others that this is not forgotten.
Finally
By liking our project and sharing it through social media you help us tremendously, simply because we will then reach a large group of potential supporters. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>irevuo Magazine will be a quarterly magazine dedicated to promoting unknown artists. We want to publish the first issue in January 2013.</p>
<p>The magazine will be available in both digital and printed editions. It will contain reviews, interviews, and a special showcase for visual artists (one artist will be chosen each issue, and promoted.) Also, we'll have articles and essays on art and related subjects.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Basically we need to cover expenses with:</p>
<p>Typesetting and layout. We need to buy specialized software to do that.</p>
<p>We'll need to order proof copies of our printed magazine, so we can make sure that the fonts, the images, everything's perfect.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we'd like to pay our artists for the art they're showcasing in our magazine (paintings, sketches, fiction, etc.) We know how important this is to an artist, maybe not as much for the intrinsic value of the amount they receive, but because it acts as a sort of validation mechanism.</p>
<p>So we would love to be a paying magazine and pay our artists for their art.</p>

<p>For my next art project I am going to travel into the vastness of Patagonia. Here, I hope to find permanent wind, most of the time from a south-southeastern direction, which, in connection with the plain, apparently infinite scenery along the coast and in the pampas, will provide me with the ideal condition for my plan. I will leave in the best, as windiest, time of the year in February, two months on the go will follow!</p>

<p><strong>With a sailing boat which has been equipped with wheels I am going to sail across the country on the road E3 and on small lonesome side streets from the south of Patagonia which is nearly unsettled across the pampas northward towards civilization.</strong></p>
<p>Only powered by the force of the wind, I will be completely dependent on this element. In contrast to sailing on water it is not possible for me to cruise against the wind on the street. The direction of the wind has to be the right one to make headway. I will have to sit out a calm or headwind, always hoping that the next wind will soon make amends for it.<br/><img alt=""Karte mit Schiff"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/483215/pictures/full/20121010085420-Karte_mit_Schiff.jpg?1349884464"" src="""" style="""" title=""Karte mit Schiff""/><br/>Thus, I will proceed northwards according to wind, course of roads and weather, aiming at Buenos Aires. I will go as far as the wind becomes a breeze, too weak to power the boat or civilization represented by traffic lights and power lines over the streets, or a bigger amount of traffic or traffic policeman will make my underpinning impossible...</p>
<p>As a result of this trip I will produce a video installation on several channels integrating my real, converted sailing boat.<br/><img alt=""Boot vor Windrad"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/481827/pictures/full/20121009123626-60x40_Windrad.jpg?1349811394"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><img alt=""Boot auf Brücke"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/481822/pictures/full/20121009123508-60x40_Boot_auf_Bruecke.jpg?1349811320"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<h3>THE FINANCING</h3>
<p>To be able to realize this project, 39,000 US$ are necessary. This sum consists of material sponsorship, personal contribution and crowdfunding (18.000US$):</p>
<ul>
<li>17,500 US$ for the sailing boat, rebuilding it and the transport to Argentina</li>
<li>17,000 US$ for film production and post production</li>
<li>4,500 US$ for collages (photograph development and shipping)</li>
</ul><p>If need be, I am happy to send you a detailed cost calculation of the project.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Crowdfunding</h3>
<p>Everybody who likes the idea can support me according to his or her means and possibilities. Besides that, it is about gaining a bit more (creative) freedom with your help. According to each sum every supporter receives a service in return.</p>
<p>*The collages and fine art prints will be produced and delivered after the sailing trip. If the project should not take place due to unknown reasons, I will guarantee that you get back your money instead of the collages and fine art prints. An early failure of the project in Patagonia is not implied here. </p>
<p>To every supporter it is guaranteed that the provided means are only used for this restricted purpose.</p>

<h3>Further needs:</h3>
<p>Who would like to support me otherwise, can get in touch with me directly.<br/>In addition to the crowd funding, further sponsors are needed to gain the entire required material. Moreover, there is the possibility to get engaged with the project, to offer know-how or to take part organizationally. The expenses can be considerably lowered thereby. This engagement will be paid with postcards and collages, too.</p>
<p>The following support is searched for right now:</p>
<ul>
<li>shipment of the sailing boat: does somebody know a lot about prices, containers and duty regulations for products shipped to Argentina? Personal contacts with international forwarding agencies and shipping company would be very helpful</li>
<li>we search for a fold-up bicycle as ""a dinghy"". If somebody has a functioning one, I would be very grateful</li>
<li>translations: the plan is to be translated into good Spanish.</li>
<li>who is in touch with Argentinian art facilities, curators, institutions, etc. to support the project – an official letter of a big institution could tune a crusty policeman more leniently...</li>
<li>generally exhibition possibilities for this project</li>
<li>tips and contacts with material sponsors and supporters</li>
<li>press contacts to help the project to more publicity</li>
<li><strong>tell about this project your friends and colleagues, to all that might enjoy it.</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>I hope that it will be possible to realize this project with your help and support!</strong></p>

<p>On a small, converted truck I hit the road to Rimini. The loading area of the truck has been transformed into an Outdoor-Mobil with a real lawn, bushes, a tent and a fireplace, which one can all together set up into a wild natural camping area immediately. The slide show presents the course of my 10-day trip over the Passo del San Gottardo to the Lago di Como and further to the beaches of Rimini, as well as the way back via Venice and the Passo del Brennero. This reflects the classical holiday itinerary to Italy that many Germans chose during the times of the wirtschaftswunder, the so-called economic miracle of the 1950s. <br/>More information <a href=""http://www.danielbeerstecher.com/english/project_sites/Outdoor-Mobil.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>

<p><strong>Sand by the Sea<br/></strong><em>2010 | video | 31:20 min</em></p>
<p>I crossed the Sahara desert dressed in a surfer´s outfit and carrying a surfboard under my arms. For half an hour one can watch me trying to come closer and closer towards the sea. The desert inhabitants who I meet are asked to tell me the way. Through the photographs that tell a story and the especially composed music a certain dense atmosphere for this absurd journey is created, which initiates reflection also of the medium film itself. It is a cinematographic picture story between movie, art and performance.<br/>More information <a href=""http://www.danielbeerstecher.com/english/video_sites/Sand_am_Meer.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>

<p><strong>ein Kunstprojekt von Daniel Beerstecher</strong></p>
<p>Die Wüste, das Meer, einsame Landschaften oder einfach die Sicht vom Gipfel eines Berges. Weite, in der der Blick durch nichts gestört wird und kaum einen Halt findet, hat mich schon immer fasziniert.</p>
<p>Umgeben von Naturgewalten wird man sich seiner wahren Größe bewusst, gesellschaftliche Probleme verlieren an Bedeutung, der eigene Horizont erweitert sich und die Dinge, die uns in unserem Alltag fesseln und überlebenswichtig erscheinen, treten in den Hintergrund.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><span style=""font-size: small;"">Wer einmal von dieser Sehnsucht nach Freiheit, Weite und Ruhe ergriffen wurde, den lässt sie nicht mehr los...</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p><img alt=""Sturm im kommen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/481853/pictures/full/20121009124352-60x40_Sturm_zieht_auf.jpg?1349811840"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Für mein nächstes Kunstprojekt begebe ich mich in die Weite Patagoniens. Hier finde ich stetig anhaltenden Wind, meist aus süd-südöstlicher Richtung, der in Verbindung mit der flachen, unendlich scheinenden Landschaft entlang der Küste und in der Pampa, die ideale Voraussetzung für mein Vorhaben bietet. Zur besten Jahreszeit im Februar geht es los, zwei Monate lang werde ich etwa unterwegs sein!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""CENTER"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">WIE PASSIERT'S</span></p>
<p><strong>Mit meinem Segelboot, das mit Rädern ausgestattet wird, möchte ich über Land auf der Hauptstraße E3 und auf kleinen einsamen Nebenstraßen vom beinahe unbesiedelten Süden Patagoniens durch die Pampa nordwärts Richtung Zivilisation segeln.</strong></p>
<p>Allein angetrieben von der Kraft des Windes, bin ich ganz und gar von diesem Element abhängig. Im Gegensatz zum Seglen auf dem Wasser ist es mir auf der Straße nicht möglich, gegen den Wind zu kreuzen. Die Windrichtung muss stimmen, um voranzukommen. Eine Flaute oder Gegenwind müssen ausgesessen werden, immer in der Hoffnung, dass es sich bald bessert.</p>
<p><img alt=""Karte mit Schiff"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/483215/pictures/full/20121010085420-Karte_mit_Schiff.jpg?1349884464"" src="""" style="""" title=""Karte mit Schiff""/></p>
<p>So geht es je nach Wind, Straßenverlauf und Wetter gen Norden, Richtung Buenos Aires. So weit, bis der Wind zu schwach wird, das Boot anzutreiben oder bis die Zivilisation durch Ampeln und Stromleitungen über den Straßen, ein großes Verkehrsaufkommen oder Verkehrspolizisten mein Unterfangen unmöglich macht...</p>
<p>Als Resultat dieser Reise soll eine Mehrkanal-Videoinstallation entstehen, in deren Zentrum mein originales, umgebautes Segelboot steht.</p>

<p><strong>OUTDOOR-MOBIL <br/></strong><em>2010 | Fotos, Diaistallation | 6:40 min</em></p>
<div>In einem kleinen, umgebauten LKW mache ich mich auf den Weg nach Rimini. Die Ladeflächen des LKWs wurden mit einer Wiese, mit Büschen, Zelt und Feuerstelle zu einem Outdoor-Mobil umgestaltet, das bei jedem Halt sofort in ein wildes Naturcampingareal verwandelt werden kann. Die Diashow zeigt den Verlauf meiner zehntägigen Reise über den Gotthard bis zum Lago di Como und weiter zum Strand in Rimini, sowie die Rückreise über Venedig und den Brennerpass. Dies entspricht etwa der klassischen Reiseroute nach Italien, wie sie viele Deutsche zur Zeit des Wirtschaftswunders gewählt haben.

Die erzählerisch fotografierten Bilder und die extra komponierte Filmmusik verleihen der absurden Reise eine spezielle, dichte Atmosphäre, die auch auf der Ebene des Mediums Film Reflexion erlaubt.

<p><strong>Um projeto de Daniel Beerstecher</strong></p>
<p>Deserto, mar, paisagens solitárias ou, simplesmente, a vista do pico de uma montanha. Uma vastidão em que não nos fixamos em algum ponto específico sempre me fascinou. <br/><br/>Estar cercado pela natureza faz com que nos demos conta de nosso real tamanho, problemas sociais parecem menos importantes, o nosso horizonte é ampliado e as questões do dia-a-dia, que parecem fundamentais para a sobrevivência, tornam-se menos relevantes. <br/><br/><strong>Quem quer que tenha sido tocado por esse desejo por liberdade, vastidão e silêncio, não pode tirar isso da cabeça...<br/></strong><br/><br/>                                       O QUE ESTÁ EM QUESTÃO</p>
<p><img alt=""Sturm im kommen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/481853/pictures/full/20121009124352-60x40_Sturm_zieht_auf.jpg?1349811840"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>O meu próximo projeto de arte é uma viagem pela vastidão da Patagônia. Lá, espero encontrar vento constante, sul-sudeste na maior parte do tempo, que, somado ao relevo de planície -- uma paisagem aparentemente infinita ao longo da costa e nos pampas -- irá possibilitar as condições ideais para o meu plano. Vou partir no melhor período do ano, com as melhores condições de vento: fevereiro. A partir daí, dois meses irão passar!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""CENTER"">COMO ISSO VAI ACONTECER</p>
<p><strong>Com um veleiro equipado com rodas, irei velejar pela rodovia E3 e por pequenas e solitárias ruas do sul da Patagônia, praticamente inabitadas nos pampas no sentido norte, em direção a Buenos Aires. </strong><br/><br/>Contando apenas com o vento como combustível, estarei totalmente dependente dele para me movimentar. Diferente de velejar na água, em terra não terei a opção de ir contra o vento. A sua direção tem que estar de acordo com o roteiro que preciso seguir.  Terei que abrir mão também das brisas, sempre esperando que o vento que vem a seguir faça as pazes comigo. </p>

<p>Indícios de civilização podem ser obstáculos para a passagem da embarcação, como sinais de trânsito e fios de alta tensão... Há ainda outros possíveis adversários, como a presença de tráfego ou guardas de trânsito. <br/><br/>Como resultado da viagem, irei produzir uma videoinstalação em diferentes canais, onde também estará presente o meu veleiro.</p>

<h3><strong>Financiamento</strong></h3>
<p>Para realizar o projeto são necessários 30 mil euros. Essa soma consiste em patrocínio(16.000€) e crowd funding (14.000 €):</p>
<ul>
<li>13.000 € para o veleiro, reforma e transporte</li>
<li>12.000 € para a produção e pós-produção do filme</li>
<li>3.500 € para o desenvolvimento das colagens (fotografia e postagem)
<div> </div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><span><strong><br/>Crowd funding</strong></span></h3>
<p>Todos os que gostarem da ideia podem apoiar de acordo com suas possibilidades. De acordo com a contribuição, cada apoiador receberá algo em troca:</p>
<p>*As colagens serão enviadas para os destinatários após a viagem. Se o projeto não ocorrer por alguma razão, garanto a devolução do seu dinheiro ao invés do envio das colagens. Se houver a impossibilidade de dar continuidade ao projeto (razões climáticas, policiais, mecânicas etc), quando já estiver em andamento na Patagônia, não haverá devolução dos recursos, pois estes já terão sido aplicados na viagem e adequação do veleiro. </p>
<p>Para todos os apoiadores, há a garantia de que os recursos serão utilizados apenas para os propósitos aqui listados. Se houver interesse, posso enviar o custo detalhado do projeto. </p>

<h3><strong>Outras necessidades:<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Quem quiser apoiar o projeto de outra forma, pode entrar em contato comigo (veja abaixo). Além do crowd funding, outros patrocinadores são necessários. Fora isso, há a possibilidade de se engajar com o projeto, oferecendo know how ou participando da organização. Dessa forma, os gastos podem ser consideravelmente reduzidos. O engajamento será pago com cartões postais e colagens. O apoio a seguir é necessário no momento:</p>
<ul>
<li>transporte do veleiro: alguém tem conhecimento de preços, containers e regulação de impostos para produtos transportados para a Argentina? Contatos de pessoas em agências de exportação e transportadoras são bem-vindos.</li>
<li>preciso de bicicletas dobráveis . Se alguém tiver alguma disponível, ficarei muito grato.</li>
<li>tradução: o plano é traduzir esse material também para o espanhol.</li>
<li>alguém tem contato com espaços de arte argentinos, curadores, instituições etc para dar apoio? Uma carta oficial de uma grande instituição pode facilitar negociações com algum policial mais “truculento”.  </li>
<li>possibilidades de exibição do projeto.</li>
<li>dicas e contatos de possíveis patrocinadores e apoiadores.</li>
<li>contatos de imprensa para divulgar o projeto.</li>
<li><strong>enviar esse conceito para amigos, para todos aqueles que possam curtir a ideia.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Espero que seja possível realizar o projeto com a sua ajuda e apoio!</strong></p>

<p>Numa caminhonete adaptada eu peguei a estrada para Rimini. A caçamba da caminhonete foi transformada em um outdoor móvel com gramado, arbustos, uma barraca e uma lareira, podendo ser percebida como uma área de camping selvagem. O slide show mostra momentos de minha viagem de 10 dias pelo Passo del San Gottardo para o Lago di Como, e também para as praias de Rimini. O caminho de volta foi por Veneza e Passo del Brennero. Muitos alemães faziam esse roteiro clássico de viagem para a Itália, em épocas de feriado, no período chamado wirtschaftswunder,  conhecido como milagre econômico dos anos 1950. </p>

<p><em>2010 | vídeo  | 31:20 min</em></p>
<p>Eu cruzei o deserto de Saara com roupas de surfista, carregando uma prancha. Por meia hora, é possível assistir a minha tentativa de me aproximar do mar. Eu pergunto aos  habitantes do deserto que encontro pelo caminho por onde devo seguir. Através das fotografias que contam uma história e da composição musical, é criada uma densa atmosfera para essa jornada absurda, que detona reflexões sobre o próprio meio filme. Esse é um trabalho entre o cinema e a performance.</p>

LAND-SAILOR
The desert, the sea, lonesome landscapes or simply the view from a mountain’s peak. Vastness, in which your view is not disturbed by anything and you find nothing to focus on has always fascinated me.
Surrounded by nature’s forces you realize your true size, social problems become less important, your own horizon is broadened and the things that absorb you in your everyday life become less important.
Whoever has been seized by this longing for freedom, vastness and silence, can’t get it out of his head....
 
WHAT IT IS ABOUT

For my next art project I am going to travel into the vastness of Patagonia. Here, I hope to find permanent wind, most of the time from a south-southeastern direction, which, in connection with the plain, apparently infinite scenery along the coast and in the pampas, will provide me with the ideal condition for my plan. I will leave in the best, as windiest, time of the year in February, two months on the go will follow!
 
HOW IT HAPPENS
With a sailing boat which has been equipped with wheels I am going to sail across the country on the road E3 and on small lonesome side streets from the south of Patagonia which is nearly unsettled across the pampas northward towards civilization.
Only powered by the force of the wind, I will be completely dependent on this element. In contrast to sailing on water it is not possible for me to cruise against the wind on the street. The direction of the wind has to be the right one to make headway. I will have to sit out a calm or headwind, always hoping that the next wind will soon make amends for it.Thus, I will proceed northwards according to wind, course of roads and weather, aiming at Buenos Aires. I will go as far as the wind becomes a breeze, too weak to power the boat or civilization represented by traffic lights and power lines over the streets, or a bigger amount of traffic or traffic policeman will make my underpinning impossible...
As a result of this trip I will produce a video installation on several channels integrating my real, converted sailing boat.
THE FINANCING
To be able to realize this project, 39,000 US$ are necessary. This sum consists of material sponsorship, personal contribution and crowdfunding (18.000US$):

17,500 US$ for the sailing boat, rebuilding it and the transport to Argentina
17,000 US$ for film production and post production
4,500 US$ for collages (photograph development and shipping)
If need be, I am happy to send you a detailed cost calculation of the project.

Crowdfunding
Everybody who likes the idea can support me according to his or her means and possibilities. Besides that, it is about gaining a bit more (creative) freedom with your help. According to each sum every supporter receives a service in return.
*The collages and fine art prints will be produced and delivered after the sailing trip. If the project should not take place due to unknown reasons, I will guarantee that you get back your money instead of the collages and fine art prints. An early failure of the project in Patagonia is not implied here. 
To every supporter it is guaranteed that the provided means are only used for this restricted purpose.

Further needs:
Who would like to support me otherwise, can get in touch with me directly.In addition to the crowd funding, further sponsors are needed to gain the entire required material. Moreover, there is the possibility to get engaged with the project, to offer know-how or to take part organizationally. The expenses can be considerably lowered thereby. This engagement will be paid with postcards and collages, too.
The following support is searched for right now:

shipment of the sailing boat: does somebody know a lot about prices, containers and duty regulations for products shipped to Argentina? Personal contacts with international forwarding agencies and shipping company would be very helpful
we search for a fold-up bicycle as ""a dinghy"". If somebody has a functioning one, I would be very grateful
translations: the plan is to be translated into good Spanish.
who is in touch with Argentinian art facilities, curators, institutions, etc. to support the project – an official letter of a big institution could tune a crusty policeman more leniently...
generally exhibition possibilities for this project
tips and contacts with material sponsors and supporters
press contacts to help the project to more publicity
tell about this project your friends and colleagues, to all that might enjoy it.
I hope that it will be possible to realize this project with your help and support!

With this project I am referring to two of my former works. They are based on similar questions, as the given examples will show. You can find further work on my web page: www.danielbeerstecher.de
Outdoor-Mobil 2010 | Photos, slide show | 6:40 min
On a small, converted truck I hit the road to Rimini. The loading area of the truck has been transformed into an Outdoor-Mobil with a real lawn, bushes, a tent and a fireplace, which one can all together set up into a wild natural camping area immediately. The slide show presents the course of my 10-day trip over the Passo del San Gottardo to the Lago di Como and further to the beaches of Rimini, as well as the way back via Venice and the Passo del Brennero. This reflects the classical holiday itinerary to Italy that many Germans chose during the times of the wirtschaftswunder, the so-called economic miracle of the 1950s. More information here
 

 
Sand by the Sea2010 | video | 31:20 min
I crossed the Sahara desert dressed in a surfer´s outfit and carrying a surfboard under my arms. For half an hour one can watch me trying to come closer and closer towards the sea. The desert inhabitants who I meet are asked to tell me the way. Through the photographs that tell a story and the especially composed music a certain dense atmosphere for this absurd journey is created, which initiates reflection also of the medium film itself. It is a cinematographic picture story between movie, art and performance.More information here

LAND-SAILOR
ein Kunstprojekt von Daniel Beerstecher
Die Wüste, das Meer, einsame Landschaften oder einfach die Sicht vom Gipfel eines Berges. Weite, in der der Blick durch nichts gestört wird und kaum einen Halt findet, hat mich schon immer fasziniert.
Umgeben von Naturgewalten wird man sich seiner wahren Größe bewusst, gesellschaftliche Probleme verlieren an Bedeutung, der eigene Horizont erweitert sich und die Dinge, die uns in unserem Alltag fesseln und überlebenswichtig erscheinen, treten in den Hintergrund.
Wer einmal von dieser Sehnsucht nach Freiheit, Weite und Ruhe ergriffen wurde, den lässt sie nicht mehr los...
 
WORUM GEHT'S 

Für mein nächstes Kunstprojekt begebe ich mich in die Weite Patagoniens. Hier finde ich stetig anhaltenden Wind, meist aus süd-südöstlicher Richtung, der in Verbindung mit der flachen, unendlich scheinenden Landschaft entlang der Küste und in der Pampa, die ideale Voraussetzung für mein Vorhaben bietet. Zur besten Jahreszeit im Februar geht es los, zwei Monate lang werde ich etwa unterwegs sein!
 
WIE PASSIERT'S
Mit meinem Segelboot, das mit Rädern ausgestattet wird, möchte ich über Land auf der Hauptstraße E3 und auf kleinen einsamen Nebenstraßen vom beinahe unbesiedelten Süden Patagoniens durch die Pampa nordwärts Richtung Zivilisation segeln.
Allein angetrieben von der Kraft des Windes, bin ich ganz und gar von diesem Element abhängig. Im Gegensatz zum Seglen auf dem Wasser ist es mir auf der Straße nicht möglich, gegen den Wind zu kreuzen. Die Windrichtung muss stimmen, um voranzukommen. Eine Flaute oder Gegenwind müssen ausgesessen werden, immer in der Hoffnung, dass es sich bald bessert.

So geht es je nach Wind, Straßenverlauf und Wetter gen Norden, Richtung Buenos Aires. So weit, bis der Wind zu schwach wird, das Boot anzutreiben oder bis die Zivilisation durch Ampeln und Stromleitungen über den Straßen, ein großes Verkehrsaufkommen oder Verkehrspolizisten mein Unterfangen unmöglich macht...
Als Resultat dieser Reise soll eine Mehrkanal-Videoinstallation entstehen, in deren Zentrum mein originales, umgebautes Segelboot steht.
 

Die Finanzierung
Um dieses Projekt realisieren zu können, sind 30.000€ nötig. Diese Summe setzt sich aus Crowdfunding (14.000€), Materialsponsoring und Eigenleistung so zusammen: 

13.500,- € für Segelboot, Umbau und Transport
13.000,- € Filmproduktion + Postporduktion
3.500,- € Collagen (Fotoausdrucke, Rahmung, Versand)

Auf Wunsch schicke ich gerne auch eine detaillierte Kostenkalkulation des Projektes zu.
Crowdfunding
Jeder, dem die Idee gefällt, kann mich nach seinen Mitteln und Möglichkeiten unterstützen. Dabei geht es um nichts weniger, als mit eurer Hilfe ein Stück Freiheit zu erlangen. Je nach Höhe des Betrags erhält jeder Unterstützer eine Gegenleistung. Siehe Perks.
*Collagen und Fine Art Prints werden nach dem Segeltörn erstellt und ausgeliefert. Falls das Projekt aus unbekannten Gründen doch nicht stattfinden sollte, besteht die Möglichkeit, anstelle der Collagen und Fine Art Prints sein Geld zurück zu bekommen. Ein frühzeitiges Scheitern des Projektes in Patagonien ist hier nicht eingeschlossen.
Jedem Unterstützer wird garantiert, dass die zur Verfügung gestellten Mittel ausschließlich zweckgebunden verwendet werden. 
 

Weitere Hilfen:

Zusätzlich zum Crowdfunding werden Sponsoren für Materialen und den Transport des Bootes angefragt, um die Kosten möglichst niedrig zu halten.
Außerdem besteht die Möglichkeit, mit anzupacken, Know-how einzubringen oder sich organisatorisch zu beteiligen. Dadurch können die Kosten erheblich gesenkt werden. Auch dieses Engagement wird mit Postkarten und Collagen honoriert. Folgende Unterstützung wird gebraucht:

Verschiffung des Segelbootes: kennt sich jemand mit Preisen, Containern und Zollbestimmungen für Ware nach Übersee aus? Persönliche Kontakte zuinternationalen Speditionen und Redereien wären sehr hilfreich.
Wir suchen ein Klappfahrrad als „Beiboot“. Falls jemand ein gebrauchfähiges hat, bin ich sehr dankbar.

Übersetzungen: das Konzept soll in gutes Spanisch übersetzt werden... Meine  Sprachfähigkeiten reichen hierzu leider nicht aus
Wer hat Kontakt zu argentinischen Kunsteinrichtungen, Kuratoren, Institutionen, um das Projekt abzusichern- ein offizielles Schreiben von einer großen Institution könnt einen schlecht gelaunten Polizisten gnädiger stimmen...
Ausstellungsmöglichkeiten im Allgemeinen für dieses Projekt. Tipps und Kontakte zu Sponsoren und FördererPressekontakte, um dem Projekt zu mehr Öffentlichkeit zu verhelfen
Postet das Projekt auf eurer Facebookseite und ladet eure Freunde ein, dass Projekt auf Indiegogo zu besuchen. 
Das Weitersenden dieses Konzepts an Freunde und Bekannte- vor allem an jene, bei denen ihr euch vorstellen könnt, dass sie an diesem Projekt gefallen finden. Ihr findet in der Galerie eine PDF-Version zum runterladen.

Ich hoffe, dass es mit eurer Hilfe und Unterstützung möglich wird, das Projekt Land-Sailor zu realisieren!

OUTDOOR-MOBIL 2010 | Fotos, Diaistallation | 6:40 min
In einem kleinen, umgebauten LKW mache ich mich auf den Weg nach Rimini. Die Ladeflächen des LKWs wurden mit einer Wiese, mit Büschen, Zelt und Feuerstelle zu einem Outdoor-Mobil umgestaltet, das bei jedem Halt sofort in ein wildes Naturcampingareal verwandelt werden kann. Die Diashow zeigt den Verlauf meiner zehntägigen Reise über den Gotthard bis zum Lago di Como und weiter zum Strand in Rimini, sowie die Rückreise über Venedig und den Brennerpass. Dies entspricht etwa der klassischen Reiseroute nach Italien, wie sie viele Deutsche zur Zeit des Wirtschaftswunders gewählt haben.

Sand am Meer2010 | Video | 31:20 min
Im Surferoutfit und mit Surfbrett unter dem Arm durchquere ich in „Sand am Meer“ die Sahara. Eine halbe Stunde lang ist zu sehen, wie ich Schritt für Schritt versuche, dem Meer näher zu kommen. Die Wüstenbewohner, denen ich begegne, frage ich nach dem Weg. Die erzählerisch fotografierten Bilder und die extra komponierte Filmmusik verleihen der absurden Reise eine spezielle, dichte Atmosphäre, die auch auf der Ebene des Mediums Film Reflexion erlaubt. Eine kinematografische Bildergeschichte zwischen Kino, Kunst und Performance. Mehr Informationen zu diesem Projekt hier

LAND-SAILOR
Um projeto de Daniel Beerstecher
Deserto, mar, paisagens solitárias ou, simplesmente, a vista do pico de uma montanha. Uma vastidão em que não nos fixamos em algum ponto específico sempre me fascinou. Estar cercado pela natureza faz com que nos demos conta de nosso real tamanho, problemas sociais parecem menos importantes, o nosso horizonte é ampliado e as questões do dia-a-dia, que parecem fundamentais para a sobrevivência, tornam-se menos relevantes. Quem quer que tenha sido tocado por esse desejo por liberdade, vastidão e silêncio, não pode tirar isso da cabeça...                                       O QUE ESTÁ EM QUESTÃO

O meu próximo projeto de arte é uma viagem pela vastidão da Patagônia. Lá, espero encontrar vento constante, sul-sudeste na maior parte do tempo, que, somado ao relevo de planície -- uma paisagem aparentemente infinita ao longo da costa e nos pampas -- irá possibilitar as condições ideais para o meu plano. Vou partir no melhor período do ano, com as melhores condições de vento: fevereiro. A partir daí, dois meses irão passar!
 
COMO ISSO VAI ACONTECER
Com um veleiro equipado com rodas, irei velejar pela rodovia E3 e por pequenas e solitárias ruas do sul da Patagônia, praticamente inabitadas nos pampas no sentido norte, em direção a Buenos Aires. Contando apenas com o vento como combustível, estarei totalmente dependente dele para me movimentar. Diferente de velejar na água, em terra não terei a opção de ir contra o vento. A sua direção tem que estar de acordo com o roteiro que preciso seguir.  Terei que abrir mão também das brisas, sempre esperando que o vento que vem a seguir faça as pazes comigo. 

Indícios de civilização podem ser obstáculos para a passagem da embarcação, como sinais de trânsito e fios de alta tensão... Há ainda outros possíveis adversários, como a presença de tráfego ou guardas de trânsito. Como resultado da viagem, irei produzir uma videoinstalação em diferentes canais, onde também estará presente o meu veleiro.

Financiamento
Para realizar o projeto são necessários 30 mil euros. Essa soma consiste em patrocínio(16.000€) e crowd funding (14.000 €):

13.000 € para o veleiro, reforma e transporte
12.000 € para a produção e pós-produção do filme
3.500 € para o desenvolvimento das colagens (fotografia e postagem)
 


Crowd funding
Todos os que gostarem da ideia podem apoiar de acordo com suas possibilidades. De acordo com a contribuição, cada apoiador receberá algo em troca:
*As colagens serão enviadas para os destinatários após a viagem. Se o projeto não ocorrer por alguma razão, garanto a devolução do seu dinheiro ao invés do envio das colagens. Se houver a impossibilidade de dar continuidade ao projeto (razões climáticas, policiais, mecânicas etc), quando já estiver em andamento na Patagônia, não haverá devolução dos recursos, pois estes já terão sido aplicados na viagem e adequação do veleiro. 
Para todos os apoiadores, há a garantia de que os recursos serão utilizados apenas para os propósitos aqui listados. Se houver interesse, posso enviar o custo detalhado do projeto. 
 



Outras necessidades:
Quem quiser apoiar o projeto de outra forma, pode entrar em contato comigo (veja abaixo). Além do crowd funding, outros patrocinadores são necessários. Fora isso, há a possibilidade de se engajar com o projeto, oferecendo know how ou participando da organização. Dessa forma, os gastos podem ser consideravelmente reduzidos. O engajamento será pago com cartões postais e colagens. O apoio a seguir é necessário no momento:

transporte do veleiro: alguém tem conhecimento de preços, containers e regulação de impostos para produtos transportados para a Argentina? Contatos de pessoas em agências de exportação e transportadoras são bem-vindos.
preciso de bicicletas dobráveis . Se alguém tiver alguma disponível, ficarei muito grato.
tradução: o plano é traduzir esse material também para o espanhol.
alguém tem contato com espaços de arte argentinos, curadores, instituições etc para dar apoio? Uma carta oficial de uma grande instituição pode facilitar negociações com algum policial mais “truculento”.  
possibilidades de exibição do projeto.
dicas e contatos de possíveis patrocinadores e apoiadores.
contatos de imprensa para divulgar o projeto.
enviar esse conceito para amigos, para todos aqueles que possam curtir a ideia.

Espero que seja possível realizar o projeto com a sua ajuda e apoio!

OUTDOOR-MOBIL 2010 | fotos, slide show | 6:40 min

Numa caminhonete adaptada eu peguei a estrada para Rimini. A caçamba da caminhonete foi transformada em um outdoor móvel com gramado, arbustos, uma barraca e uma lareira, podendo ser percebida como uma área de camping selvagem. O slide show mostra momentos de minha viagem de 10 dias pelo Passo del San Gottardo para o Lago di Como, e também para as praias de Rimini. O caminho de volta foi por Veneza e Passo del Brennero. Muitos alemães faziam esse roteiro clássico de viagem para a Itália, em épocas de feriado, no período chamado wirtschaftswunder,  conhecido como milagre econômico dos anos 1950.

Sand am Meer
2010 | vídeo  | 31:20 min
Eu cruzei o deserto de Saara com roupas de surfista, carregando uma prancha. Por meia hora, é possível assistir a minha tentativa de me aproximar do mar. Eu pergunto aos  habitantes do deserto que encontro pelo caminho por onde devo seguir. Através das fotografias que contam uma história e da composição musical, é criada uma densa atmosfera para essa jornada absurda, que detona reflexões sobre o próprio meio filme. Esse é um trabalho entre o cinema e a performance.

<p class=""p1""><b>Hyperflesh Markup Language at the Banff Centre</b></p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">I am a queer, HIV-positive artist living and working in Montreal, Quebec. Since graduating from the Intermedia/Cyberarts program at Concordia University in April 2011, I have been working extremely hard at fostering my emerging art practice. Recently I was accepted to participate in a thematic residency entitled <i>Art and the effects of the Real</i> at the Banff Centre in Banff, Alberta. Directed by Vancouver-based artist and academic Ken Lum, the residency will take place over 50 days in January and February 2012. It is a unique opportunity to dedicate myself to producing art work and developing my art practice in an exciting new direction. I only recently found out about my acceptance and therefore need to raise the necessary funding in a short period of time. This is why I am turning to you through IndieGoGo in order to make this great opportunity to grow as an artist into a reality.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Hyperflesh Markup Language </i>is the title of my proposed program of research and creation at the Banff Centre<i>. </i>The title is a play on the technical term ""hypertext markup language"" ie: the coding language used to program websites. As such, the art that I will be making will examine the space where the body, identity, and the Internet intersect. My focus will be on creating performative works that draw upon queer cyberspace as sites for personal disclosure and play. Using the print, video, and studio resources of the Banff Centre, I will be making work that exists both online (as animated GIFs and videos) and as physical objects like large-scale photographic prints, sculptural installations, and text-based wall works made with materials like vinyl, styrofoam, and neon signage. I will also being using web broadcasting and social media tools as venues for live performances. The subject matter for these works will come from online sources and digital artifacts such as chat transcripts, user profiles on cruising websites, blogs, pornographic images and videos. </p>

<p class=""p1""><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">This residency is an amazing chance for me to grow as an artist and to push my emerging art practice into a professional context. It will be my first residency opportunity outside of university and I will be making links with my artistic peers from all over the country. As a program of work that uses the internet as a point of creation and dissemination, the audience for my work will be far-reaching and diverse.  </p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">This is important because I present an important point of view in terms of the art that I am producing. As a queer, HIV-positive artist, the action of disclosure is prevalent in all of my work; it is a relentless process through which I situate myself towards others and within the world. Some – many – of my works deal with personal disclosure: for example, I discuss my HIV status, expose my queerness or report my sexual history. Some – most – examine the structures of disclosure (discursive, formal, cultural). I employ disclosure as a means to initiate a circuit of information, feeling, and/or action between myself and the viewer. It is in this evolving process of exchange that my art works are reproduced from my everyday experience. So far, I have found that my work does a lot to stimulate a discussion around what it means to live with HIV/AIDS. The internet has been a really useful tool to do this and I am excited to engage in an artistic residency program that will allow me to push my engagement with an online audience even further.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Without your help I may have to greatly reduce the amount or quality of work that I would like to produce during my residency, or in the worst case scenario not attend the program at all. I am doing everything that I am capable of to make this happen, however as a recent University graduate and struggling artist, I have limited resources for raising this money in such a short period. </p>

<p class=""p1""><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">As previously mentioned, I received my acceptance into the program at the end of September, which leaves a very short turn around time to raise the money to go. Right now, I have just enough money to pay for the tuition cost of the program. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to raise the money for any other expenses related to my residency. This is why I am turning to you through this IndieGogo campaign. The $3000 raised with this campaign will go towards covering three things: my materials budget, travel expenses, and living expenses other than room and board at the Banff Centre. </p>

<p class=""p1"">This consists of the biggest portion of the money that I need to raise in order to have a successful residency.  Some concrete expenses that I will need to cover are a new hard drive and printing costs at the Banff Centre digital labs. Furthermore, as an experimental residency, I need to have a materials budget that allows for me to try things out and adapt to new demands in my production. </p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>

<p class=""p1""><u>$500 living expenses</u></p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Although my room and board are covered in my tuition fee for the program, I will still need money to help pay for any other daily/monthly living expenses for the 50+ days that I will be at or traveling to and from the Banff Centre.

It is challenging to constantly enter paid competitions and open calls, as well as attending paid lectures, workshops and talks that are important for any practitioner’s career. This is why we decided to create an independent, non-profit platform to showcase the work of emerging artists for free. Until now we have used our Instagram account and website to showcase the images of talents that we have discovered or that have submitted work to us. We believe that by hosting free events we will help students, graduates and emerging artists to enrich their practice, develop their skills and expand their knowledge, hence this campaign is very important to us!</p><p>Until now we have been funded by the University of Portsmouth, which has helped us to secure a gallery space in London. We are going to have the exhibition from the 6th to the 9th of September at Four Corners Gallery. As part of the show we would like to host two additional events. The first one, happening on the 8th, would be a collaborative workshop between Revolv and other collectives. Together we would work on the creation of a self-published zine, featuring the works of the artists that we have already showcased on our respective platforms. The zine will be available free of charge for our visitors. The second event will take place on the 9th of September and will consist of talks by four guest speakers from the creative industry. They will introduce their practice and give advice on creative topics drawing upon their own experiences of the art world. One of our guests is the award-winning artist Felicity Hammond. We would like to make this happen whilst keeping our events free but ensuring that our guests get compensated for their time and contributions.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p>We need £500 to be able to cover the travel expenses for our contributing artists. On the Friday (8th of September) we have planned to host a collaborative zine workshop – the participants will be members from other collectives, who have been invited to get involved. The event will start at 10:30 and finish approximately 15:30 – by the end of which we would have a complete zine and start producing more free copies for visitors.</p><p>The first collective we are working with is<a href=""http://londonaltphoto.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong> London Alternative Photography Collective</strong></a>, led by three artists.

<h3>About Gender Unbound Art Fest</h3>
<p>Gender Unbound Art Fest is a multi-discipline art festival that exclusively features transgender and intersex creators. We use art, music, and performance to celebrate an often marginalized community, empower gender diverse creators, and educate the general public in a context outside of celebrity coming out stories and bathroom legislation. We also connect attendees to much-needed services and organizations.</p>
<p>The second annual Gender Unbound Art Fest will take place on Saturday, Sept. 2, 2017, at Vuka North Lamar (5540 N Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78756). The event is run by Gender Portraits, a sponsored nonprofit project of Austin Creative Alliance that documents and advocates for gender diverse people through art.</p>
<p>We need your help to make Gender Unbound 2017 a success!</p>

<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498678142/zxqz4s7zscjr50lksqfn.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Gender Unbound is funded in part through a grant by the City of Austin Cultural Arts Division of Economic Development. After our fiscal sponsor’s fees are taken out, our $3,750 city grant pays for most of Vuka’s venue rental fee. Many elements of the event will be sourced from donated goods—like alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, snacks, merchandise (shirts and stickers), and signage.</p>
<p>But we still need your help to pay for other expenses. Our $3,000 funding goal (minus 5%-10% in Indiegogo fees) will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The remainder of Vuka’s venue rental fee</li>
<li>Event insurance (required by both city and venue contracts)</li>
<li>Screen printing for shirts</li>
<li>Supplies for reward levels: badges, packaging for art bundles, etc.</li>
<li>Event supplies: posters, pamphlets/flyers, wristbands, cups, etc.</li>
<li>Equipment rentals: audio equipment, assistive listening devices, etc.</li>
<li>Performer stipends: payment for musicians, performers, event emcee, etc.</li>
<li>Administrative stipends: payment for the event organizer, stage manager, volunteer coordinator, etc.</li>
<li>Contractor stipends: payment for the photographer, videographer, sound tech, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we pass our $3,000 goal, we will build toward things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist stipends: payment for exhibiting visual artists</li>
<li>Travel stipends: payment to bring in out-of-state artists</li>
<li>Increasing all stipends: raising payment amounts to market rate for all talent and organizers</li>
<li>Gender Unbound Art Fest 2018: start-up funds for next year’s event</li>
</ul>
<p>We have taken great care to minimize the amount of Indiegogo money that is spent on perk rewards. We've created substantial Indiegogo perks using high-value items that will already be created as a part of the festival like tickets, shirts, and art. This ensures that the maximum amount of raised funds will be spent on the festival. In addition, no Indiegogo funds will be used for shipping or handling of perks.</p>

<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>All perks will be delivered digitally or picked up in-person at the event. As mentioned in the section above, this is to ensure that more funds are spent on the festival rather than on perk fulfillment. If you are wanting to support Gender Unbound but can't make it to Austin for the festival, we recommend selecting perks for sponsored tickets and/or projected ads.</p>

<p>Get an advance ticket to Gender Unbound 2017 for $5 (will be $7 at the door) <strong>or</strong> sponsor a ticket to Gender Unbound 2017 for a community member!</p>
<p>Sponsored tickets are dispersed to trans, intersex, and LGBTQ+ organizations in Texas to be distributed where they are needed most in the community.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Gender Unbound is an event dedicated entirely to uplifting transgender and intersex creators. Last year, we featured and paid 13 artists and 3 musicians. We were also able to pay for the travel of one artist, Catherine Graffam, from New Hampshire to attend the festival as both an artist and a speaker. According to survey feedback, our artists were able to make over $2500 in art sales at the event, with many reporting that the festival was their most successful show of the year. Financially empowering trans and intersex artists enriches the entire community by amplifying their voices with creative and visible expression.</p>
<p>In that vein, Gender Unbound is an opportunity for the general public to see the strength, complexity, and beauty of transgender and intersex voices in contrast to the misinformation and hostility that transgender and intersex people increasingly face. Around 400 people attended Gender Unbound Art Fest 2016, and of those who responded to our follow-up survey, 89% said that they knew more about gender diverse people, communities, and/or issues after attending the festival. We hope that through the vibrant creators showcased in Gender Unbound 2017 will spark an interest in transgender and intersex issues for even more attendees.<br/><br/>We also use the festival as an opportunity to connect our artists and attendees to some vital services. At our inaugural event, we had community social and support organizations tabling with info, Aids Services of Austin providing free HIV testing, and nonpartisan voter registration. Almost a third of our survey respondents said that they connected with a service or resource at the event.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks: Because grant funding is already secured for the majority of the venue rental cost, and the event is run in large part by volunteers, there is no risk of Gender Unbound Art Fest 2017 being cancelled for lack of funding. The quality and the nature of the festival may change depending on the amount of Indiegogo funding, but Gender Unbound will still happen in some form.</p>
</div><div><p>Challenges: We anticipate that our biggest challenge will be raising enough money to be able to pay artists, performers, and organizers fairly. While we had help from many dedicated volunteers in 2016, Gender Unbound Art Fest 2017 will shine brightest if we raise enough money to ensure that artists, performers, and organizers can participate without asking them to shoulder any financial stress.</p></div><div>

</div></div>","About Gender Unbound Art Fest
Gender Unbound Art Fest is a multi-discipline art festival that exclusively features transgender and intersex creators. We use art, music, and performance to celebrate an often marginalized community, empower gender diverse creators, and educate the general public in a context outside of celebrity coming out stories and bathroom legislation. We also connect attendees to much-needed services and organizations.
The second annual Gender Unbound Art Fest will take place on Saturday, Sept. 2, 2017, at Vuka North Lamar (5540 N Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78756). The event is run by Gender Portraits, a sponsored nonprofit project of Austin Creative Alliance that documents and advocates for gender diverse people through art.
We need your help to make Gender Unbound 2017 a success!


What We Need
Gender Unbound is funded in part through a grant by the City of Austin Cultural Arts Division of Economic Development. After our fiscal sponsor’s fees are taken out, our $3,750 city grant pays for most of Vuka’s venue rental fee. Many elements of the event will be sourced from donated goods—like alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, snacks, merchandise (shirts and stickers), and signage.
But we still need your help to pay for other expenses. Our $3,000 funding goal (minus 5%-10% in Indiegogo fees) will pay for:

The remainder of Vuka’s venue rental fee
Event insurance (required by both city and venue contracts)
Screen printing for shirts
Supplies for reward levels: badges, packaging for art bundles, etc.
Event supplies: posters, pamphlets/flyers, wristbands, cups, etc.
Equipment rentals: audio equipment, assistive listening devices, etc.
Performer stipends: payment for musicians, performers, event emcee, etc.
Administrative stipends: payment for the event organizer, stage manager, volunteer coordinator, etc.
Contractor stipends: payment for the photographer, videographer, sound tech, etc.

If we pass our $3,000 goal, we will build toward things like:

Artist stipends: payment for exhibiting visual artists
Travel stipends: payment to bring in out-of-state artists
Increasing all stipends: raising payment amounts to market rate for all talent and organizers
Gender Unbound Art Fest 2018: start-up funds for next year’s event

We have taken great care to minimize the amount of Indiegogo money that is spent on perk rewards. We've created substantial Indiegogo perks using high-value items that will already be created as a part of the festival like tickets, shirts, and art. This ensures that the maximum amount of raised funds will be spent on the festival. In addition, no Indiegogo funds will be used for shipping or handling of perks.

Perks
All perks will be delivered digitally or picked up in-person at the event. As mentioned in the section above, this is to ensure that more funds are spent on the festival rather than on perk fulfillment. If you are wanting to support Gender Unbound but can't make it to Austin for the festival, we recommend selecting perks for sponsored tickets and/or projected ads.

We will use a variety of mediums (social practice art, ceramics, boat building, photography, music, poetry) to address the ever-important conversation about water and environmental stewardship as the river flows a mere 50 yards from the performance space.

<p>MWMO has generously funded half of our budget. We are seeking to raise $1,600 in order to cover the remaining costs, including support for the artists’ time, materials and transport costs. Donations will allow us to bring work by artist Anna Metcalfe, composers Katherine Bergman, Joshua Clausen and Daniel Nass, the ensembles Zeitgeist, the Stone Arch Collective, the River Singers, and poet and songwriter Ben Weaver. </p>
<p>In recognition of your gifts, donation perks include prints of Anna’s work, downloads of all the music, ceramic story cups from Anna’s installation, and personalized collaborative pieces, made one-of-a-kind from Anna and Josh. </p>

Donations will allow us to bring work by artist Anna Metcalfe, composers Katherine Bergman, Joshua Clausen and Daniel Nass, the ensembles Zeitgeist, the Stone Arch Collective, the River Singers, and poet and songwriter Ben Weaver. 
In recognition of your gifts, donation perks include prints of Anna’s work, downloads of all the music, ceramic story cups from Anna’s installation, and personalized collaborative pieces, made one-of-a-kind from Anna and Josh.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am a Hillary Clinton Super Volunteer and I support my candidate with my Hillary-themed art car. The Hillcar is a 1989 Toyota Corolla, painted with images of Hillary Clinton, decorated with jewels, toys, game pieces, and lots of glitter. The Hillcar has campaigned for Hillary in 15 states since 2008.</p>
<p>We recently campaigned with the Hillcar on the East Coast in 6 states during their Democratic primaries. We got out the vote in a burst of color, smiles and fun in New York, Conneticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania. We also talked about the need for more art in schools, more free art programs for kids, as well as advocating for good border relations through art. </p>
<p>Now we would like to drive the colorful Hillcar to California to campaign in the biggest primary of them all. 475 delegates are at stake. A win in California is essential in preventing a contested Democratic Convention. The delegate math says Hillary will win the nomination, but she needs to win big so that Bernie supporters and Hillary supporters can join forces and begin to hard work that's ahead.</p>
<p>I would also like to continue to advocate on a national level for the importance of art in schools and the power of free art programs for kids. Hillary has dedicated her life to championing quality education, which includes the arts. Your donations will also ensure the continuation of my free, grassroots art programs such as <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BorderBedazzlers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Border Bedazzlers</a>, <a href=""http://artenvoys.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art Envoys</a>, and <a href=""http://www.paintyourtown.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paint Your Town! </a></p>
<p>The power of Hillcar is that it can get Hillary's message to a lot to people at a very low price. We drive the Hillcar through as many neighborhoods as we possibly can, stopping and talking to people all along the way. We offer photo opportunities and inspire people to feel included and excited.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From the same team that brought you the Image TMNT conclusion (Vol. 3 #24 &amp; 25) as well as ""TMNT: Odyssey"" comes a brand new graphic novel. This one takes place after a couple of years after Mirage TMNT Vol. 4, with Donatello leading an excursion to the center of the universe both to save it (an unknown energy is breaking down all life on a cellular level) as well as get answers for himself, his brothers and the others in his group along the way. Answers will be had, secrets revealed and consequences will be suffered.</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Andrew Modeen, a writer and filmmaker from the Seattle area. I’m a lifelong fan of the TMNT, and am also the guy responsible for the Image TMNT comic book conclusion that you can read about here: <a href=""http://www.thegreenlanterncorps.com/tmnt/vol3.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thegreenlanterncorps.com/tmnt/vol3.html</a><br/>Also ""TMNT: Odyssey,"" of which you can read a digital version here: <a href=""http://www.thegreenlanterncorps.com/tmnt/odyssey.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thegreenlanterncorps.com/tmnt/odysse...</a>
</li>
<li>""Origin"" is a 95+ page graphic novel that will feature Donatello leading an expedition to the center of the universe that will question everything he, his brothers, and those that he brings along for the journey have held as absolutes. A science fiction tale featuring adventure, action, as well as consequences. </li>
<li><p>The book is illustrated by Jim Lawson, veteran TMNT artist who has been drawing the TMNT since nearly the very beginning. Classics like “Sons of the Silent Age,” “Return to New York,” “City at War,” Tales of the TMNT Vol. 1, the entirety of TMNT Vol. 2 (Mirage), TMNT Vol. 4, and a great deal of Tales of the TMNT Vol. 2… this is the guy. Check out what he's been up to here: <a href=""http://jimlawsonart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jimlawsonart.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>Dan Berger, another TMNT veteran, contributes a 5 pages of artwork for a Splinter-based tale within the main storyline and narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Andres Ponce, longtime TMNT artist (""Tales of the TMNT,"" Vol. 2 will contribute the cover artwork).</p></li>
<li><p>The ""Professor Obligado"" storyline from ""Tales of the TMNT,"" Vol. 2 sees conclusion and ties directly into the main ""Origin"" narrative. This will be in black and white with duotones, to suit the previous installments of this. Drawn by Jim Lawson, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>A disconnected 20 page bonus backup will be included that features the Turtles squaring up against a popular intergalactic alien hunter species you may or may not be familiar with in the forests of Northampton.

<li><p>We have a variety of rewards in store for people able and willing to contribute to the project, as you will see below.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>As with ""Odyssey,"" Jim Lawson has very graciously attached himself to the project as our artist, however he does need compensation. 7 pages of “Odyssey” have already been commissioned and completed in order to show you what is in store, but to complete the project additional funding is needed. As we're going color in this project (the Obligado introduction notwithstanding) we will also need to cover the cost of a colorist, the very talented Courtland Brugger. Beyond this and the printing costs (which we now know very well what to expect after ""Odyssey"" and the Image conclusion) and the actual campaign fees to Indiegogo, we need to make sure every base is covered.</li>
<li>We are definitely not asking for money to profit in any way, shape, or form – we are only looking for funds to continue commissioning Jim Lawson for the pages that remain, then see things through on the production side. In addition to helping bring to fruition this project contributing is also a big way to give back to a man who has given a great deal to TMNT as we know it today. </li>
<li>Funds received will be going to Jim Lawson first and foremost to get the remaining pages pencilled and inked, then to our colorist, and then to cover the final cost of the printing and distribution which we need to not lose sight of. Rich Horn, who was a huge asset during ""Odyssey""'s distribution, has also graciously agreed to help in all matters of that to ensure speedy delivery of the final product.</li>
<li>The greatest care will be taken in the final shipping of the printed books. Rich Horn at tmnt-ninjaturtles.com has been been doing this a long time and sends books out with high quality packaging.</li>
</ul>
<div><h3>The Risk</h3></div>
<div><ul><li>In the event this campaign is unsuccessful to meet its goal, if at least 50% of goal is met then it will still be full-steam ahead. This is a passion project and it will be seen through, the same as ""Odyssey"" and the Image TMNT finisher. Jim Lawson will continue to be commissioned, albeit at a slower pace. If less than 50% of the goal is reached, however, all funds will be returned. </li></ul></div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm David Orr. Under my Orogenic Industries name, I make art and design inspired by the vast awesomeness of prehistoric life! For years, I've created enamel pins, screen printed art, embroidered patches, stickers, tee shirts, and more to share my love of paleontology. These pins, featuring Tiktaalik and Lystrosaurus, have a timely message to inspire us to look back at the grand achievements of evolution, when our ancient ancestors explored new frontiers and persisted through disaster and cataclysm.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding goal has been set to be able to produce 100 each of each pin. They'll come carded and packed in sustainable shipping materials.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals!</h3>
<p>If we meet the stretch goal of $1000, we will unlock <strong>embroidered patches</strong> of each design as well! Pledge levels for bundled pins and patches will offer additional savings.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I create work for my own paleo-centered project Orogenic Industries as well as Blue Aster Studio, and with both projects, my goal is to spread the joy of science and nature. So with products like these pins, my greatest hope is that they allow my fellow science geeks a new way to spark conversations about the beauty of the natural world and the profundity of deep time. And I love creating pieces that shine a little light on the obscure, but no less wonderful, facets of life on Earth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a low-risk project! I have years of experience with design and production, and I've seen many projects like this through to completion. The designs are complete and production-ready. We just need some money to make them happen!</p>
<p>Of course, we are all dealing with a global pandemic, and that can have unexpected impacts on any industry. But I am working with trusted partners who are staying hard at work even through the COVID-19 crisis, and I will stay on top of any changes to production timelines as soon as I am aware of them!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like these pins and want to see them get made, but can't afford to pledge now, I still appreciate your support more than I can express. Spreading the word on social media makes a HUGE difference, and I'm grateful for every link you can tweet or plug on Facebook or Instagram.</p>

For years, I've created enamel pins, screen printed art, embroidered patches, stickers, tee shirts, and more to share my love of paleontology. These pins, featuring Tiktaalik and Lystrosaurus, have a timely message to inspire us to look back at the grand achievements of evolution, when our ancient ancestors explored new frontiers and persisted through disaster and cataclysm.

What We Need & What You Get
The funding goal has been set to be able to produce 100 each of each pin. They'll come carded and packed in sustainable shipping materials.
Stretch Goals!
If we meet the stretch goal of $1000, we will unlock embroidered patches of each design as well! Pledge levels for bundled pins and patches will offer additional savings.

The Impact
I create work for my own paleo-centered project Orogenic Industries as well as Blue Aster Studio, and with both projects, my goal is to spread the joy of science and nature. So with products like these pins, my greatest hope is that they allow my fellow science geeks a new way to spark conversations about the beauty of the natural world and the profundity of deep time. And I love creating pieces that shine a little light on the obscure, but no less wonderful, facets of life on Earth.

Risks & Challenges
This is a low-risk project! I have years of experience with design and production, and I've seen many projects like this through to completion. The designs are complete and production-ready. We just need some money to make them happen!
Of course, we are all dealing with a global pandemic, and that can have unexpected impacts on any industry. But I am working with trusted partners who are staying hard at work even through the COVID-19 crisis, and I will stay on top of any changes to production timelines as soon as I am aware of them!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you like these pins and want to see them get made, but can't afford to pledge now, I still appreciate your support more than I can express. Spreading the word on social media makes a HUGE difference, and I'm grateful for every link you can tweet or plug on Facebook or Instagram.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</div><p> </p><h3>FAQ<br/> </h3><p><strong>What is silkscreen printing?</strong><br/>Silkscreen printing is a printmaking technique in which an image is transferred into a stencil in a mesh screen, which can then be used to reproduce the stenciled image. The image can be anything: a marker drawing, a digital image, and painted brush stroke, as long is it is entirely opaque, and on a transparent surface. This silkscreen-ready image is called a transparency, film, or positive. The silkscreen itself is then coated in photo-emulsion, which is light sensitive. When the coated screen and the positive are exposed to a light source, the area blocked by the positive, which is your image, remains water-soluble, while the exposed areas of the screen are hardened. When you then rinse your screen with water, the area of your image washes out, leaving a stencil through which ink can pass. <br/><br/><strong>When will I receive my perk?</strong><br/>You will receive your gift in Fall 2018.

Nu är vandringen i gång, och behöver byggas på.This campaign is a continuation of the campaign Europe by Foot, which laid the ground for the walk. Now the walk is under way, and need to be built on.Video in EnglishFölj äventyret / Follow The AdventurePå svenska:Blogg: framstegen.netFacebook: facebook.com/FramStegenTwitter: twitter.com/framstegenIn English:Blog: tomsorhannus.lifeFacebook: facebook.com/europebyfoot/Twitter: twitter.com/europebyfootGräsrotsfinansiering – Ett enkelt sätt att stödaEftersom många av er kanske inte är bekanta med gräsrotsfinansiering och hur man gör om man vill understöda ett projekt gjorde jag en kort video som visar hur det går till (se nedan).Gräsrotsfinansiering ger vem som helst, som du och jag, möjlighet att bidra till att ett projekt kan förverkligas. Det är samtidigt ett sätt att kunna förverkliga projekt som kanske annars inte skulle bli av.Alla summor är välkomna och bidrar till att göra vandringen möjlig, stora som små, inget är för smått och inget är för stort. Det är helt och hållet upp till dig vad du bidrar med om du vill vara med och förverkliga vandringen. Allt tas emot med tacksamhet och uppskattning!Förutom de alternativ som finns till höger kan du också ge en helt valfri summa genom att klicka på BACK IT, fylla i summan och sedan klicka på Check Out, vilket tar dig till betalningssidan. Även här ingår förmåner, beroende på summans storlek.På betalningssidan (gäller även dem som valt ett av de färdiga alternativen) fyller du i ditt namn, din e-postadress och leveransadress, vart du vill ha skickat de fysiska förmåner som ingår om du valt ett sådant alternativ, och till sist betalningsuppgifterna.Vill du hellre understöda på något annat sätt går det också att ordna, bara skicka ett mejl åt mig på tom.sorhannus@gmail.com så kommer vi överens om hur det ska gå till.Har du frågor om finansieringen och hur det går till att understöda får du också gärna mejla. Jag förstår att det kan vara knepigt att få grepp om det hela, och jag lär mig själv någonting nytt varje dag, så fråga gärna.Det är bara tillsammans vi kan göra det här möjligt.Crowd Funding - A Simple Way to ContributeSince many of you might not be familiar with crowd funding and how to contribute I made a short video on how it works.

Målet / The Target
Målet för den här andra delen av kampanjen är satt till 500 €, och det är ett delmål. Når vi dit under kampanjtiden kan kampanjen fortsätta utan avbrott ända till Gibraltar. Det gör det hela enklare, annars måste jag sätta upp en ny kampanj då den här går ut. Kampanjmålet kan enbart nås med DIN hjälp. Är du med och gör det möjligt?Även om kampanjen går i Euro är det fullt möjligt att delta också från länder med annan valuta, som Sverige. Betalningen görs med kreditkort.The target for this second part of the campaign is set to 500 €, and if we reach there during the campaign time the campaign can continue without interruption all the way to Gibraltar. It makes things easier, because otherwise I will have to start up a new campaign when this one runs out. The campaign target is possible to reach only with YOUR support. Will you participate in making it possible?När och hur / When and WhereVandringen startade den 20 juni 2017, från Pjelax, Närpes och målet är Gibraltar, nästan så långt söderut man kan komma i Europa.Distansen är uppskattningsvis drygt 4000 km, och beräknas ta ett halvår att genomföra. Det här är ändå inte ett äventyr för att bevisa något utan för att utforska, uppleva och uttrycka något, så tidtabellen är flexibel och flytande.The walk started on June 20, 2017 from Narpes, a place known for its tomatoes and cucumbers, located in western Finland, and will end in Gibraltar in the very south of Europe, on the border to Africa.The distance is approximately 4000+ kilometers, and the estimated time to get it done is half a year. However this is not about perfoming to prove something, but performing to explore, experience and express something, so the time table is flexible and fleeting.Utforska, uppleva, uttrycka och skapa / Explore, Experience, Express and ShareJag kallar mig själv levnadskonstnär, vilket i praktiken betyder att utforska, uppleva, uttrycka och dela, och jag vill dela det här äventyret med dig. Det betyder att du kommer att kunna ta del av sådant som skapas under äventyret...såsom texter, dikter, foton och videon.Att vandra till fots är ett utmärkt sätt att utforska världen, både den yttre och den inre världen (vilka i verkligheten är en värld).Det är också ett utmärkt sätt att uppleva det tidlösa och gränslösa. När man är där ute och vandrar försvinner både tid och gränser.Att vandra och att skriva är två naturliga sätt för mig att ge uttryck för det som livet gett mig. På något sätt är vi alla konstnärer, och att dela med oss av våra naturliga gåvor och att växa som människor är allt vad det här livet egentligen handlar om.I call myself a life artist, which practically speaking means exploring, experiencing, expressing and sharing, and I want to share this adventure with you. That means you will be able to take part of creations coming up along the road, such as...texts, poems, pictures and videos.Walking by foot is an excellent way of exploring the world, both the outer world and the inner world, and it brings one close up to both these worlds (which in reality are one world).It is also an excellent way to experience the timeless and boundless true reality, which we all are parts of. When you are out there walking time and borders simply disappear.Walking and writing are two natural ways for me to let life express itself. In some way we are all artists, and sharing our natural gifts and growing as humans is really what this life is all about.För Dig / For YouGräsrotsfinansiering handlar inte bara om att ge understöd, utan det är ett utbyte så du får också något tillbaka.Först och främst kommer du med ditt understöd att göra äventyret möjligt, och därmed kunna följa det och ta del av sådant som skapas under resans gång, texter, dikter, foton, videon, och allt det här kommer att finnas tillgängligt på bloggenFramStegen.net...och via sociala medier.Ge 5 € eller mera och du hjälper till att göra det hela möjligt och kan följa det.Ge 10 € eller mera och få ett signerat digitalt tack kort.Ge 20 € eller mera och få ett signerat fysiskt tack kort sänt hem till dig.Ge 30 € eller mera och få en e-bok från resan + ett signerat digitalt tack kort.Ge 60 € eller mera och få en inbunden bok från resan + ett signerat fysiskt tack kort.Ge 100 € eller mera och få en inbunden bok från resan + en extra mindre bok + ett signerat fysiskt tack kort.Ge 150 € eller mera och få 2 inbundna böcker + en extra mindre bok + ett signerat fysiskt tack kort.Alla de här tack korten och böckerna har en uppskattad leveranstid i maj/juni 2018, men det här är väldigt preliminärt och kan förändras.Det kommer att vara möjligt att ge understöd under hela resans gång.Notera att det tillkommer en avgift för frakt på 5 € inom EU och 10 € i resten av världen för de fysiska böckerna. Det här för att täcka en del av fraktkostnaderna.Crowd funding is not only about contributions, it is an exchange.What´s then in it for you? First of all you will be able to follow the journey through the blogtomsorhannus.life and through social media and take part of what is created along the road, such as texts, poems, pictures, videos and so on.This will all be avaliable to you for free, but by supporting the journey and contributing to it and make it happen there is more in it for you.Pledge 5 € or more and Be able to follow itPledge 10 € or more and get A signed digital thank you card.Pledge 20 € or more and get A signed physical thank you card sent to you.Pledge 30 € or more and get an E-book from the journey + A signed digital thank you card.Pledge 60 € or more and get A hardcover book from the journey + A signed physical thank you cardPledge 100 € or more and get A hardcover book + A special small book (physical) + A signed physical thank you cardPledge 150 € or more and get 2 hardcover books + A special small book (physical) + A signed physical thank you cardThe estimated delivery dates for the perks (see list to the right) are at this point very preliminary, and may change.It will also be possible to contribute during the walk.Note: there will be a shipping fee of 5 € in the EU and 10 € in the rest of the world added to the physical books, to cover some of the shipping costsDe 3 P:na / The 3 P´sDet här äventyret handlar inte om mig, utan det är ett sätt att ge uttryck för något större. Allt sant skapande, allt konstnärskap, handlar om att ge uttryck för livets djupare och högre dimensioner.Videon nedan är på engelska, och innebörden är att det hela handlar om vår inneboende potential, om den inre kraften vi alla har och som driver allt samt om att upptäcka att den här jorden vi bor på är ett paradis.As every true creation this is not first and foremost about the one creating, but there is something bigger behind it. Running at the centre of this adventure and creation is what I call the 3 P´s.The Human Potential, inborn in everyone of us.The Inner Power, running through all of us, and being the driving force behind everything that is.This Paradise, that we are living in. Earth is a paradise, we just need to adjust our eyes and our vision to be able to see it.Leading up to the fourth P - Peace.Kul / FunNaturligtvis handlar det här också om att ha kul. Varför annars göra något sådant här?Kärlek, glädje och skratt är vad det mänskliga livet och mänskligt välmående är baserat på, och det är sådant vi alltid borde ha med oss.Sant skapande är konstruktivt, och kommer ur en källa av kärlek och lekfullhet.Livet självt är ett evigt pågående äventyr och skapande.Of course, this is also about having fun. Why otherwise do something like this?Love, joy and laughter are the trinity of life, and should be with us in everything we do. They are the basic elements of human life and human wellbeing. Isn´t wellbeing something we are looking for in everything?True creation is constructive, and comes out of love and fun.Life itself is an ever ongoing funny adventure and creation.Bakgrund / BackgroundIdén till det här äventyret föddes under en vandring längs pilgrimsleden till Santiago de Compostela våren 2009.

I then realized that people had walked by foot across Europe hundreds of years ago, and I thought......if it was possible then it should be possible today.The walk in Spain woke something in me, a dormant love for walking and nature and the open, free, eternal space one experiences when out there in our natural habitat.

De hittills insamlade medlen kommer att gå till vandringen, och den här nya kampanjen ska förhoppningsvis bygga på den tidigare kampanjen.Jag är alltså på väg på vandringen och tar det dag för dag, och ser hur det går.Det är alltså möjligt att ge understöd under vandringens gång, här på kampanjsidan.

Just remember if you do it online to use the Indiegogo share tools.Vägen / The RoadDet här är ingen asketisk vandring och inte heller en vandring i ren vildmark. Den kommer att gå längs landsbygden, men också genom byar och städer, och jag kommer att använda mig av bekvämligheter för till exempel mat och övernattning.Jag kommer att ha med mig ett tält och en sovsäck samt en hängmatta, men jag kommer också att tillbringa nätter under tak. Jag bestämmer från dag till dag hur det blir.This is not an ascetic walk and it is not a walk in real wilderness. It will go on the countryside and along lonely roads, but it will also go through populated areas, villages, towns and cities, and I will use comforts (for food and sleep) along the road.Some parts may go along walking trails, but the main part will go along ordinary roads, preferably smaller ones, bicycle paths and similar. This means I will have to find my own overnight stays, and other conveniences.I will carry with me a tent and a sleeping bag, and a hammock, but I will also spend nights under roofs, and I decide from day to day how I spend the nights.Övrigt / MoreDet finns naturligtvis inga garantier för att det här projektet kommer att lyckas. Allt kan hända i det här äventyret vi kallar livet, men det finns ingen orsak att oroa sig på förhand eller att måla upp problem. Situationer i livet är till för att genomlevas, och ibland händer det att vi helt enkelt tvingas ändra riktning. Det kan jag i alla fall lova, att jag kommer att göra mitt bästa för att uppfylla det här äventyret.Kom ihåg att den här presentationen bara är ett litet, litet frö, som innehåller så mycket, mycket mera, om vi får det att gro och växa. Det kan bli en vacker planta med njutbara frukter.Så genom att understöda vandringen hjälper du fröet att gro och växa, och du blir en del av det här ävetyret som kallas Europe by Foot - Vandringen.Sprid gärna budskapet om vandringen och kampanjen.Ju fler som tar del desto större är sannolikheten att kunna genomföra det här hela vägen, och desto mera får även du ut av det.Tack för att du tagit dig tid att läsa det här och om du bestämmer dig för att bidra och vara en del av äventyret är jag väldigt tacksam! Alla bidrag räknas, stora som små.Of course there is no guarantee that this project will succeed. Anything can happen in this adventure we call life, but there is no reason to worry or paint pictures of negativity beforehand. Situations are there to be lived through, and sometimes it just happens that we have to change our direction, but one thing I can assure you, I will do the best I can to fulfill this creation.I know there will be days with rain, I know there will be days with sun, I know there will be hard days, and I know there will be days with fun. I know I sometimes will be lost, but I also know that most of the time I will find my way.Remember that this presentation is just a tiny, tiny, tiny small seed, and it contains so much, much, much more if we get it to sprout and grow.It can become a beautiful plant, with tasty fruits.So by contributing you will be a part of making it grow, and be a part of this adventure called Europe by Foot - The Walk.Feel free to spread the word about the walk and the campaign around you and over the world.The more people who take part in it the more probable it is to get it all the way through, which means you will also get more out of it.Thank you for taking your time to read this and if you want to contribute and be a part of the adventure I am very grateful!

As an artist, there is no limit to where I find inspiration for my art.
The focus of my work the past few years has very clearly been mythology,
folklore, and translating these old cultural beliefs into contemporary
narratives which apply to us today. <br/></p>
<p>
Through illustrating my comic series Mt. Olyphant, writing my own
stories, reading Joseph Campbell, and many other books on creation myths, deities,
and the myths of the Underworld, I have come to write a series that is
primarily inspired by Aztec imagery and themes. It will not be solely an Aztec comic,
but instead a comic that draws on universal themes found in multiple
mythologies about creation, death, the hero’s journey, and rebirth.<br/>
<br/>
There is no better place to be one with the dead than Mexico on Dia de los
Muertos.<br/>
<br/>
By contributing to this journey, you will not only be able to follow my journey
to Mexico, but also help enable my research for future art pieces, my future
comic series, and many more fabulous stories.<br/>
<br/>
I would be so grateful for your help. <br/>
To be able to experience the culture of Mexico’s people has been a dream for a
long time, and to do my story justice would be a worthy cause.
<br/></p> <ul><br/></ul> </div> <div> <h3>First, the Good Part: What You Get by Helping<br/>
</h3>
I will be making drawings and small paintings all during my time in
Mexico. If you so generously help me, then these will find their way into your
hands either in the form of postcards or the original drawings themselves. <br/>
<br/>
I will be making two different sets of postcards, the Deity Deck (10 different
designs) which will be illustrations of Aztec and Mayan deities with a
description on the back; and the Travel Deck (10 different designs) which will
feature authentic food, places of interest and cultural traditions unique to
Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Day of the Dead Deck: Stretch Goal!<br/>
As a stretch goal (2,000), I will make a third set of post cards (10 designs)
and send it with contributions of $20 or more.

<h3>The Bad and the Ugly: Travel Costs Mad Money<br/>
</h3>
<span>Travelling is expensive: usually a minimum of $700 expensive if you are
travelling out of the country. A great experience like this is not cheap, but
it will reap so much inspiration for art. As long as I have enough to get home.<br/>
<br/>
By helping me on this journey, you will get excerpts from Mexico itself: street
food, art museums, Aztec and Mayan pyramids, sacrificial altars, and LOTS of skulls, all through
ART! <br/>
<br/>
Whether tasting tacos, or visiting with spirits, the pieces from this trip will be
a great way to directly support the arts, but also receive some in return!<br/>
<br/>
So $700 is specifically for air fare, it is about $350 each way (woah).<br/>
Besides that are hostel accommodations (we are going cheap at about $45/night
for 5 nights: ~$250 after taxes) and car rental or bus fare from Mexico City to Aguascalientes
(about 5-6 hours). Also, the cost of making all of these FABULOUS postcard sets may end up being +$300 and shipping costs, I could go on, but no one wants that.<br/></span><br/><b><h3>Impact: HUGE<br/>
</h3></b>

A big deal about contributing SPECIFICALLY to this journey is the spiritual
aspect of Dia de los Muertos.<span> 
Halloween does not have the same impact in the US as in Mexico. This
holiday is all about family ties, and it is believed the dead are not only
remembered, but present WITH us in the land of the living on this day. <br/>
<br/>
We will be celebrating Dia de los Muertos in Aguascalientes, which hosts the
Festival de Calavares: Festival of Skeletons. The perfect place to see
authentic sugar skulls, and skeletons dancing on All Hallow’s Eve! This is the only city in the country to host this festival, along with the traditional grave decorating, memorial altars, and much more.<br/><br/>
I feel very strongly about the cultural, spiritual, and artistic merits
of this journey. Through art, the vitality of Mexico will shine through the
pages, and you will be supporting an artist directly! <br/>
<br/>
I have put on projects of impossible scale before with the help of my friends
and I am asking you again to lend a hand. The Lyceum comes to mind as something
improbable and against the odds, which only happened with the help of my
wonderful, talented friends. Let’s make something amazing happen again.

Travelling is intense and can be stressful. Being a stranger in a
strange land can be disorienting, but I am brushing up on my conversational
Spanish, and hoping to use my sketchbook as an icebreaker. <br/>
<br/>
Also planes. They suck.<br/>
But, FOR ART!<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind all of this would make a GREAT and easy Christmas gift. I can even

<p>
</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>(<i>scroll down for English and Crew info)</i></p>
<p>En un pequeño país, en el corazón de
Oriente Próximo, hubo una revolución cultural, entre los años 60 y 80. Había
una necesidad latente de expresarse mediante el arte, la creación, el ambiente
artístico de todo el mundo que se reunía en esta pequeña pero potente tierra
conocida como Líbano.</p>
<p>Durante la época de la contracultura,
Beirut y más aún, el Líbano fueron el epicentro de este movimiento en Oriente
Próximo. ¿Acaso sabemos que a finales de los 60, inicios de los 70, había
festivales con hitos de la historia de la música americana como Joan Baez,
Charlie Mingus, Miles Davis… en las ruinas romanas de Baalbek? </p>
<p>Pocos archivos de la actividad cultural de
aquella época se han conservado, o al menos eso es lo que se creía. </p>
<p>A finales de los años 60, apareció en el
mapa un joven entusiasta y apasionado de las artes, Waddah Faris, el
protagonista de nuestro documental.Estudió
arquitectura para posteriormente dirigirse al diseño de interiores, galerista,
pero sólo una cosa se ha mantenido siempre en su vida: la fotografía.Cargando siempre con su cámara, vivió
y retrató una generación que marcó el camino cultural que seguiría el país, hasta
que llegó la Guerra Civil. Su obra no ha sido exhibida nunca hasta este año, y
lo hará a lo grande hacia finales de 2016. Con la ayuda de Saleh Barakat,
galerista y marchante de arte y viejo amigo de Faris. </p>
<p>Tristemente, las guerras tanto internas
como externas que ha sufrido el país y sus alrededores, hacen que no conozcamos
otra faceta más que esa.</p>

<h3>Nota del Director</h3>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">El principal motivo por el que me
siento atraído hacia el proyecto es tan simple y a la vez tan complejo, como
que un hijo quiere descubrir a su padre y las raíces culturales del país del
cual proviene la mitad de su familia. </span><br/></p>
<p>A esto se le suma que W. Faris, mi
padre, fue una figura central y hasta ahora desconocida en la vida y el
movimiento cultural de un país que estaba en auge. </p>
<p>Hará casi dos años supe que se
llevaría a cabo esta exposición. Fue con el experto en arte árabe, moderno y
contemporáneo, y galerista libanés Saleh Barakat con quien aprendí lo que había
representado mi padre para la historia del movimiento cultural del país en las
décadas previas a la Guerra Civil. </p>
<p>Siempre había sabido que era un gran
fotógrafo y me había contado sus anécdotas, pero fue cuando Saleh me dijo
“Teymur, tu padre es un tesoro nacional y haremos que lo vea todo el mundo”,
cuando me di cuenta.</p>
<p>Empecé a observar sus fotografías a
dos niveles: por un lado como archivos sobre el Líbano en ese periodo concreto,
y por el otro lado, como piezas artísticas en sí mismas.</p>
<p>Miraba a una pared, en su casa de
Beirut. Un increíble retrato de una mujer misteriosa en una tienda. Era una mujer
beduina, cerca de Baalbek de 1972. Miraba a otro lado y encontraba una obra, no
de gran tamaño, firmada por Max Ernst –uno de los padres del surrealismo– con
una dedicatoria a mi padre. Resulta que Ernst fue a Beirut en sus últimos años
con su esposa Dorothea Tanning (también reconocida artista del mismo
movimiento) y mi padre estuvo toda su estancia acompañándoles tras entablar una
buena amistad. </p>

<h3>Director's Note</h3>
<div>
<p><i>The main reason for which I feel attracted to
this project is as simple but at the same time as complex, as a son who wants
to discover his father and the cultural roots of the country from which half of
his family is from.</i></p>
<p><i>To this, we have to add that W. Faris, my
father, was a central figure and unknown until now in the life and cultural
movement of a country that was booming. A war that lasted almost twenty years,
and ended what was once the center of the Middle East.</i></p>
<p><i>About two years ago I came to know that this
exhibition would take place. It was the expert in modern and contemporary Arab
art, and Lebanese gallery owner Saleh Barakat, from whom I learned what my
father had represented for the history of this cultural movement in the country
during the pre-Civil War decades.</i></p>
<p><i>I had always known that he was a great
photographer and he had told me his stories (which amazed me more every time,
due to what I discovered from the country and the Lebanese cultural life), but
it was when Saleh told me: “Teymur, your father is a national treasure and
we’ll make the entire world see it”, when I realized.</i></p>
<p><i>I began to observe his photographs in two
levels: on one side as archives about Lebanon during that period, and on the
other hand, as artworks by themselves.</i></p>
<p><i>I looked towards a wall, in his home in
Beirut. An incredible portrait of a mysterious lady in a tent. It was a Bedouin
woman, close to Baalbek in 1972. I looked at the other side and I could see an
artwork, not quite big, signed by Max Ernst –one of the fathers of the
surrealistic movement- dedicated to my dad. Apparently, a late Ernst visited
Beirut with his wife Dorothea Tanning (also a renown artist of this
movement) and my father spent all their stay accompanying them after they
had bonded and become close friends.</i></p>
<p><i>The only person who has archives of this trip
that these central figures of contemporary art history is my father. I began to
understand that those images were something else, documents. Documents that
exposed the heart of a culture, of a generation, in a country that to almost
everyone goes unnoticed.</i></p>
<p><i>With this documentary I’d like the audience to
learn and understand the cultural life of that country, and make them see
through W.F.’s photographs, that are probably the only archives that portray so
fully Lebanon during its most revolutionary years.</i></p>

(scroll down for English and Crew info)
En un pequeño país, en el corazón de
Oriente Próximo, hubo una revolución cultural, entre los años 60 y 80. Había
una necesidad latente de expresarse mediante el arte, la creación, el ambiente
artístico de todo el mundo que se reunía en esta pequeña pero potente tierra
conocida como Líbano.
Durante la época de la contracultura,
Beirut y más aún, el Líbano fueron el epicentro de este movimiento en Oriente
Próximo. ¿Acaso sabemos que a finales de los 60, inicios de los 70, había
festivales con hitos de la historia de la música americana como Joan Baez,
Charlie Mingus, Miles Davis… en las ruinas romanas de Baalbek? 
Pocos archivos de la actividad cultural de
aquella época se han conservado, o al menos eso es lo que se creía. 
A finales de los años 60, apareció en el
mapa un joven entusiasta y apasionado de las artes, Waddah Faris, el
protagonista de nuestro documental.Estudió
arquitectura para posteriormente dirigirse al diseño de interiores, galerista,
pero sólo una cosa se ha mantenido siempre en su vida: la fotografía.Cargando siempre con su cámara, vivió
y retrató una generación que marcó el camino cultural que seguiría el país, hasta
que llegó la Guerra Civil. Su obra no ha sido exhibida nunca hasta este año, y
lo hará a lo grande hacia finales de 2016. Con la ayuda de Saleh Barakat,
galerista y marchante de arte y viejo amigo de Faris. 
Tristemente, las guerras tanto internas
como externas que ha sufrido el país y sus alrededores, hacen que no conozcamos
otra faceta más que esa.




Nota del Director



El principal motivo por el que me
siento atraído hacia el proyecto es tan simple y a la vez tan complejo, como
que un hijo quiere descubrir a su padre y las raíces culturales del país del
cual proviene la mitad de su familia. 
A esto se le suma que W. Faris, mi
padre, fue una figura central y hasta ahora desconocida en la vida y el
movimiento cultural de un país que estaba en auge. 
Hará casi dos años supe que se
llevaría a cabo esta exposición. Fue con el experto en arte árabe, moderno y
contemporáneo, y galerista libanés Saleh Barakat con quien aprendí lo que había
representado mi padre para la historia del movimiento cultural del país en las
décadas previas a la Guerra Civil. 
Siempre había sabido que era un gran
fotógrafo y me había contado sus anécdotas, pero fue cuando Saleh me dijo
“Teymur, tu padre es un tesoro nacional y haremos que lo vea todo el mundo”,
cuando me di cuenta.
Empecé a observar sus fotografías a
dos niveles: por un lado como archivos sobre el Líbano en ese periodo concreto,
y por el otro lado, como piezas artísticas en sí mismas.
Miraba a una pared, en su casa de
Beirut. Un increíble retrato de una mujer misteriosa en una tienda. Era una mujer
beduina, cerca de Baalbek de 1972. Miraba a otro lado y encontraba una obra, no
de gran tamaño, firmada por Max Ernst –uno de los padres del surrealismo– con
una dedicatoria a mi padre. Resulta que Ernst fue a Beirut en sus últimos años
con su esposa Dorothea Tanning (también reconocida artista del mismo
movimiento) y mi padre estuvo toda su estancia acompañándoles tras entablar una
buena amistad. 
La única persona que tiene archivos
del viaje de estas figuras esenciales del arte contemporáneo, es mi padre. Empecé
a comprender que esas imágenes eran algo más, eran documentos. Documentos que
exponen el corazón de una cultura, de una generación, en un país que para casi
todo el mundo ha pasado desapercibido.
Con este documental quiero que el
espectador pueda aprender y comprender la vida cultural de ese país y hacérselo
ver a través de las fotografías de W. F., que probablemente sean los únicos
archivos tan completos que retraten el Líbano en sus años más
revolucionarios. 








El impacto
Con este documental, pretendemos
correr la cortina tras la cual se escondía una revolución contracultural
equiparable a la que se dio en Occidente, pero que había permanecido
desconocida hasta ahora. 

A través de la obra de W. Faris, lograremos reconstruir y viajar hasta una época,
en donde Beirut se encontraba en plena efervescencia. Un mundo de ensueño,
hasta que la guerra lo convirtió en una pesadilla.

Synopsis
In a small
country, in the heart of the Middle East, there was a cultural revolution,
between the 60s and 80s. There was an underlying need to express oneself
through art, creation, and the artistic community from all around the world met
in this small but powerful land known as Lebanon.
During the
time of the counterculture, Beirut and furthermore, Lebanon was the epicenter
of this movement in the Middle East. This small country in the Eastern end of
the Mediterranean goes unnoticed by most, although it’s been a key factor
throughout history and cultural evolution, from the Phoenician times to the
present. Do we know that in the late 60s, early 70s, there were festivals with
milestones of American music like Joan Baez, Charlie Mingus, Miles Davis… in
the Roman ruins of Baalbek?
Few
archives have been kept from the cultural activity of that period, or at least
that’s what people thought.
In the late
60s, appeared on the map a young, enthusiastic and passionate man about the
arts, Waddah Faris, the star of our documentary. Always carrying his camera, he
lived and portrayed a generation that marked the cultural path that this
country would continue until the Civil War arrived.
His work has
never been exhibited until this year, and will make it big by the second half of 2016, with the help of Saleh Barakat, gallery owner, art marchant and long time friend of Faris'.
Sadly, both
internal and external wars that have hit the country have left us with no
knowledge of any other facet of this area.


                                 

Director's Note

The main reason for which I feel attracted to
this project is as simple but at the same time as complex, as a son who wants
to discover his father and the cultural roots of the country from which half of
his family is from.
To this, we have to add that W. Faris, my
father, was a central figure and unknown until now in the life and cultural
movement of a country that was booming. A war that lasted almost twenty years,
and ended what was once the center of the Middle East.
About two years ago I came to know that this
exhibition would take place. It was the expert in modern and contemporary Arab
art, and Lebanese gallery owner Saleh Barakat, from whom I learned what my
father had represented for the history of this cultural movement in the country
during the pre-Civil War decades.
I had always known that he was a great
photographer and he had told me his stories (which amazed me more every time,
due to what I discovered from the country and the Lebanese cultural life), but
it was when Saleh told me: “Teymur, your father is a national treasure and
we’ll make the entire world see it”, when I realized.
I began to observe his photographs in two
levels: on one side as archives about Lebanon during that period, and on the
other hand, as artworks by themselves.
I looked towards a wall, in his home in
Beirut. An incredible portrait of a mysterious lady in a tent. It was a Bedouin
woman, close to Baalbek in 1972. I looked at the other side and I could see an
artwork, not quite big, signed by Max Ernst –one of the fathers of the
surrealistic movement- dedicated to my dad. Apparently, a late Ernst visited
Beirut with his wife Dorothea Tanning (also a renown artist of this
movement) and my father spent all their stay accompanying them after they
had bonded and become close friends.
The only person who has archives of this trip
that these central figures of contemporary art history is my father. I began to
understand that those images were something else, documents. Documents that
exposed the heart of a culture, of a generation, in a country that to almost
everyone goes unnoticed.
With this documentary I’d like the audience to
learn and understand the cultural life of that country, and make them see
through W.F.’s photographs, that are probably the only archives that portray so
fully Lebanon during its most revolutionary years.

     
The Impact


With this documentary, we
want to shed some light on this countercultural revolution which can be
compared to the one that was lived in the West, but it had remained unknown
until now.
Through the work of W.
Faris, we'll rebuild and travel to a time, where Beirut was in full swing. A
dream-like world until the war turned it into a nightmare.
