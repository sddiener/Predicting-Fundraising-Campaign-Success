<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p><i>The
Betrothal</i> is the story of many mothers in Uganda and other developing
countries who lose their children due to preventable causes. Often, it is because public
officials steal funds meant for their treatment or vaccination. In the play,
the playwright, Joshua Mmali, dramatizes one such case, using a village woman in
Uganda and her baby on the one hand, and a young gentleman who works in the
Ministry of Health on the other. After stealing a lot of money in underhand
deals that involve his bosses, this public official is intent on marrying his
beautiful girlfriend whose mother, coincidentally, is the village woman
mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><b>Why this play is important</b></p>
<p>The drama highlights health issues that people have to grapple with everyday in developing countries. It is a play that addresses an issue that is very close to my heart, and that is why I am inspired to see its success. When I lost my father, Dr. Joseph
Sepiriya Nyanzi on the 8th of August 2014, it was on his way from Masaka to Kampala- a two-hour drive to hospital. Had there
been a health centre well equipped for bypass surgery in Masaka, my father
would still be alive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The
playwright <b>seeks to raise awareness
about the dangers of corruption</b> in Uganda, in Africa, and in any society
that might be impacted by such dangers. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>New play BREATHE tackles the thorny issue of mental health amongst millenials trying to make their way in life.</p>
<p>BREATHE pans across the struggles of four housemates living in London trying to successfully accomplish their dreams. Personal secrets, fears and dreams emerge as their lives intertwine, revealing the importance of human connection and friendship in the face of anxiety and depression. Will they choose security or transform their fears into fuel to conquer their dreams? </p>
<p>At the heart of our play lies the idea of bringing the medium of theatre and film together through the fusion of video projections and social media’s overshadowing presence. BREATHE is designed to engage in a dialogue with the viewer, provoking introspection and stimulating imaginations through the use of visual projections.</p>
<p>We believe that the topic of mental illness is particularly relevant in the current period of time in which the UK and several regional councils have reported high rate of low mental wellbeing among their citizens. The play aims to open the question to mental illness to everyone and open up these ‘labels’ as anxiety and depression to a wider public and allow an open discussion without the need to judge or discriminate.</p>

<h3>WAR Trilogy Synopsis</h3>
<p>At some point in the future, the United States is engaged in a violent war with another country. Political tensions between the two countries have escalated over the past few years, resulting in the most dire and bloody conflict in recent American history: Operation Janus. A Soldier, part of the United States Army Reserve, receives orders to deploy to the war, forcing him to leave behind his newlywed wife. Devastated by the news, but also realizing that the deployment was imminent, the Soldier leaves with the understanding that he might not come back. </p>
<p><i>WAR</i> is a story told through dance and cinematography about love, trauma, guilt, grief, and acceptance in the face of extreme conflict. </p>
<h3><strong>WAR Principal Cast</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>The Soldier (Rowan Quinain)</u></strong><br/>The Soldier, a member of the United States Army Reserve, is a young man enjoying a good life with the Love of his life, his newlywed wife. He works a great full-time civilian job while simultaneously advancing his military career on the side. As a reservist, he has never been deployed and has grown comfortable with his civilian life. However, everything changes when one day, he receives orders to report to active duty in Operation Janus, the most dire and bloody conflict in recent American history. Uncertain of his future, the Soldier is faced with the prospect of leaving behind his Love, as well as the imminent burdens of war and its consequences should he return. Whether or not he returns from his deployment, the Soldier's life is destined to change forever.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Love (Liz Galvan)</u></strong><br/>The Love is a young woman newly married to the love of her life, the Soldier. With a great job and a wonderful husband, the Love is blissful and lives life with intense fulfillment every single day. Her idyllic is turned completely upside down when her Soldier receives orders to deploy overseas to Operation Janus, a violent conflict borne from mounting tensions between the antagonizing country and the United States. She is heartbroken and fearful of being separated from her Soldier, knowing that there is a chance he might never return. However, she recognizes that he made a commitment to serve his country, and by making a commitment to the Soldier, the Love also made a commitment to let him go should he be called to duty. Through this trial, she learns to find acceptance in the circumstances that befall her, and that near or far, her love will always be with the Soldier, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Girl (Amy Shin)</u></strong><br/>A mysterious figure haunting the Soldier's dreams, the Girl is an enigma that only the Soldier is able to see. He is unsure of who she is, but knows that this Girl changed the course of his life forever. The Soldier gets the feeling that this Girl played a role in his service in Operation Janus, but for one reason or another, he cannot remember who she is. The significance of her existence is a mystery that the Soldier is hesitant to solve, but as her memory starts to consume him he has no choice but to face both his past and the Girl, in more ways than one.</p>
<h3>WAR Project Background</h3>
<p>My name is Specialist Rowan Quinain. I have been a dancer in the Chicago urban dance community for about six years now, and just recently also completed Initial Entry Training for the United States Army as a Corrections/Detentions Specialist. In December of last year, I returned home to Chicago as an Army Reservist and plan to continue pursuing civilian employment, education, and of course, my passion for dance.</p>
<p>The <i>WAR Dance Trilogy</i> is a project I have been conceptualizing since June of 2017. During this time, I was set to soon leave Chicago to complete my military training. As one of the first members, if not <i>the</i> first member, of the Chicago urban dance community to join the military and continue my dance career on the side, I wanted to take advantage of this unique position and tell stories to the community that have never been told before.</p>
<p>For a while now, I have recognized that my purpose as a dancer is to convey emotion and to tell stories. At its core, dance is a highly passionate form of art. Passion is also intertwined with suffering, and I have always sought to convey both positive and negative emotions through dance, to tell stories of my own trials and tribulations without fear of reprimand or embarrassment. Through <i>WAR</i>, however, I hope to tell the story of soldiers everywhere that may be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury as a result of their service in war. The characters in this trilogy are intentionally left nameless, as they could be absolutely anyone. Although this story is fictional, the message behind it is very much non-fictional, and there are many veterans that seek to benefit from an art project like this existing in the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking to raise at least <strong>$3,000 </strong>for this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Filmography ($1,000/33%) </strong>- A bulk of the funds raised from this campaign will go towards filmography provided by the amazing Viet Phan from New Pixel Films. I have a very close working and personal relationship with Viet; he has almost exclusively shot my concept videos in the past and I am 100% confident he would be perfect to help bring this project to fruition. This portion of funds will cover all aspects of the filming process to include filming, lighting, editing, consulting, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cast/Crew Pay ($500/17%) </strong>- I will be asking a lot of my cast members in terms of emotion through dance and acting and I am sure to challenge their boundaries and comfort as artists. Because of the artistic value of the work I am seeking to produce, I want to make sure my cast members are properly compensated for their contribution to my project. Additionally, any additional funds will go towards compensating additional crew members (yet to be determined) to potentially include a makeup artist, a sound designer, and more. In addition to financial compensation, I also would like to provide simple sustenance for my cast and crew on each day of production, whether it be for filming or editing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Costumes/Props ($500/17%) </strong>- For the most part, many costumes in this video series will be provided either by me or another cast/crew member. However, there is a possibility I will need to purchase additional costumes for other scenes. There will also be a need to purchase additional military gear for scenes depicting the Soldier in action, which will consume a majority of the funds for this section.</li>
<li>
<strong>Premiere Event ($600/20%) </strong>- After the videos have been produced, I want to use a portion of the funds raised from this campaign to host a premiere event to screen the trilogy. This event will be catered and will feature opening performances from the Chicago community to include dance, spoken word, music, and more. I will also have a booth set up for Mission22, a nonprofit organization with three programs to benefit veterans and veteran families who are suffering or have lost a loved one due to PTSD.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mission22 Contribution ($400/13%) </strong>- Finally, the last portion of funds from this campaign will be donated to Mission22, mentioned above. M22 was founded based on the fact that over 20 veterans take their own lives every single day due to the effects of Post Traumatic Stress and Traumatic Brain Injury. M22 has three major programs to help combat this: Awareness, the War at Home Memorial, and Veteran Treatment Programs. M22 represents the perfect bridge between military life and art and I could not choose a better beneficiary for this project. In addition to funds raised here on IndieGogo, all proceeds and donations raised at the <i>WAR</i> Premiere Event will be added to my contribution to M22. You can find out more about M22 here: <a href=""http://www.mission22.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mission22.com/</a> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Through <i>WAR</i>, I hope to bridge the gap between my experiences as a new soldier and as a dancer. In order to maintain maximum authenticity and respect, I will be meeting with several members of the Armed Forces, both current members and veterans, in order to paint a genuine picture of wartime and its effects for myself. I will also be consulting with these people regarding creative/story choices I am making in the WAR Dance Trilogy to make sure each story beat is purposeful, respectful, and impactful.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, a portion of the proceeds from this campaign and the eventual release event will go towards benefiting Mission22. I believe M22's programs are the embodiment of what I am trying to accomplish with this project, and I think that with our combined efforts, we can make real strides in the war against veteran suicide and PTSD. My hope is to make even the smallest stride towards reducing the number of veteran suicides and to help the effort to fight PTSD and raise awareness about issues that are not heavily discussed today, especially not in the Chicago dance community. If this project can help save just one life, then I've accomplished my goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><u><strong>Choreography Process</strong></u> - I have been choreographing for several years now and have taught various classes in the Chicagoland area, Minnesota, and California. While I am a capable choreographer, I am by no means an expert nor would I consider myself ""fast"" at choreographing. I can foresee the largest roadblock to this project would be the creative process itself and challenging myself to create the most impactful choreography that I can. While I have no doubt in my mind I can get it done, it is moreso an issue of <i>how fast </i>I can get it done, which is why I have left ample time in my production timeline for choreography itself. However, my cast members have assured me that should I need any assistance whatsoever, I can lean on them for creative advice and collaboration, so I don't see this as a pressing issue in terms of production.</p>
<p><strong><u>Authenticity</u></strong> - I recognize that I myself do not have experience in the subject matter discussed in <i>WAR</i>. As stated previously, I am a new member of the Armed Forces and do not have any combat experience under my belt. One of my utmost concerns is the need for authenticity and respectful storytelling in the execution of this project, which is why I have already mentioned that I will be consulting with fellow soldiers, veterans, and ambassadors from Mission22, the non-profit that I seek to help benefit through this project.

<p><strong><u>Deployment</u></strong> - Finally, the ideas and story behind this project were all based on my very real fear of getting deployed. My reserve unit is currently ""ready for deployment,"" which means I could get the call at any moment to leave within 30 days. This call could happen next week, next month, or not at all. While I am afraid, I am ready to fulfill my commitment as an Army Soldier and am currently steeling myself for the possibility of leaving home again soon. Should a deployment happen within the timeline of this production, all production will understandably cease until I return from my deployment. I ask for your understanding in this worst case scenario, as if it happens, there is nothing I can do to continue production while I am deployed. However, I am determined to bring this project to fruition no matter what happens, so production will continue as soon as I return home.</p>

</div></div>","WAR Trilogy Synopsis
At some point in the future, the United States is engaged in a violent war with another country. Political tensions between the two countries have escalated over the past few years, resulting in the most dire and bloody conflict in recent American history: Operation Janus. A Soldier, part of the United States Army Reserve, receives orders to deploy to the war, forcing him to leave behind his newlywed wife. Devastated by the news, but also realizing that the deployment was imminent, the Soldier leaves with the understanding that he might not come back. 
WAR is a story told through dance and cinematography about love, trauma, guilt, grief, and acceptance in the face of extreme conflict. 
WAR Principal Cast
The Soldier (Rowan Quinain)The Soldier, a member of the United States Army Reserve, is a young man enjoying a good life with the Love of his life, his newlywed wife. He works a great full-time civilian job while simultaneously advancing his military career on the side. As a reservist, he has never been deployed and has grown comfortable with his civilian life. However, everything changes when one day, he receives orders to report to active duty in Operation Janus, the most dire and bloody conflict in recent American history. Uncertain of his future, the Soldier is faced with the prospect of leaving behind his Love, as well as the imminent burdens of war and its consequences should he return. Whether or not he returns from his deployment, the Soldier's life is destined to change forever.
The Love (Liz Galvan)The Love is a young woman newly married to the love of her life, the Soldier. With a great job and a wonderful husband, the Love is blissful and lives life with intense fulfillment every single day. Her idyllic is turned completely upside down when her Soldier receives orders to deploy overseas to Operation Janus, a violent conflict borne from mounting tensions between the antagonizing country and the United States. She is heartbroken and fearful of being separated from her Soldier, knowing that there is a chance he might never return. However, she recognizes that he made a commitment to serve his country, and by making a commitment to the Soldier, the Love also made a commitment to let him go should he be called to duty. Through this trial, she learns to find acceptance in the circumstances that befall her, and that near or far, her love will always be with the Soldier, and vice versa.
The Girl (Amy Shin)A mysterious figure haunting the Soldier's dreams, the Girl is an enigma that only the Soldier is able to see. He is unsure of who she is, but knows that this Girl changed the course of his life forever. The Soldier gets the feeling that this Girl played a role in his service in Operation Janus, but for one reason or another, he cannot remember who she is. The significance of her existence is a mystery that the Soldier is hesitant to solve, but as her memory starts to consume him he has no choice but to face both his past and the Girl, in more ways than one.
WAR Project Background
My name is Specialist Rowan Quinain. I have been a dancer in the Chicago urban dance community for about six years now, and just recently also completed Initial Entry Training for the United States Army as a Corrections/Detentions Specialist. In December of last year, I returned home to Chicago as an Army Reservist and plan to continue pursuing civilian employment, education, and of course, my passion for dance.
The WAR Dance Trilogy is a project I have been conceptualizing since June of 2017. During this time, I was set to soon leave Chicago to complete my military training. As one of the first members, if not the first member, of the Chicago urban dance community to join the military and continue my dance career on the side, I wanted to take advantage of this unique position and tell stories to the community that have never been told before.
For a while now, I have recognized that my purpose as a dancer is to convey emotion and to tell stories. At its core, dance is a highly passionate form of art. Passion is also intertwined with suffering, and I have always sought to convey both positive and negative emotions through dance, to tell stories of my own trials and tribulations without fear of reprimand or embarrassment. Through WAR, however, I hope to tell the story of soldiers everywhere that may be suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury as a result of their service in war. The characters in this trilogy are intentionally left nameless, as they could be absolutely anyone. Although this story is fictional, the message behind it is very much non-fictional, and there are many veterans that seek to benefit from an art project like this existing in the world.

What We Need & What You Get
I am seeking to raise at least $3,000 for this project.


Filmography ($1,000/33%) - A bulk of the funds raised from this campaign will go towards filmography provided by the amazing Viet Phan from New Pixel Films. I have a very close working and personal relationship with Viet; he has almost exclusively shot my concept videos in the past and I am 100% confident he would be perfect to help bring this project to fruition. This portion of funds will cover all aspects of the filming process to include filming, lighting, editing, consulting, and more.

Cast/Crew Pay ($500/17%) - I will be asking a lot of my cast members in terms of emotion through dance and acting and I am sure to challenge their boundaries and comfort as artists. Because of the artistic value of the work I am seeking to produce, I want to make sure my cast members are properly compensated for their contribution to my project. Additionally, any additional funds will go towards compensating additional crew members (yet to be determined) to potentially include a makeup artist, a sound designer, and more. In addition to financial compensation, I also would like to provide simple sustenance for my cast and crew on each day of production, whether it be for filming or editing.

Costumes/Props ($500/17%) - For the most part, many costumes in this video series will be provided either by me or another cast/crew member. However, there is a possibility I will need to purchase additional costumes for other scenes. There will also be a need to purchase additional military gear for scenes depicting the Soldier in action, which will consume a majority of the funds for this section.

Premiere Event ($600/20%) - After the videos have been produced, I want to use a portion of the funds raised from this campaign to host a premiere event to screen the trilogy. This event will be catered and will feature opening performances from the Chicago community to include dance, spoken word, music, and more. I will also have a booth set up for Mission22, a nonprofit organization with three programs to benefit veterans and veteran families who are suffering or have lost a loved one due to PTSD.

Mission22 Contribution ($400/13%) - Finally, the last portion of funds from this campaign will be donated to Mission22, mentioned above. M22 was founded based on the fact that over 20 veterans take their own lives every single day due to the effects of Post Traumatic Stress and Traumatic Brain Injury. M22 has three major programs to help combat this: Awareness, the War at Home Memorial, and Veteran Treatment Programs. M22 represents the perfect bridge between military life and art and I could not choose a better beneficiary for this project. In addition to funds raised here on IndieGogo, all proceeds and donations raised at the WAR Premiere Event will be added to my contribution to M22. You can find out more about M22 here: http://www.mission22.com/ 


The Impact
Through WAR, I hope to bridge the gap between my experiences as a new soldier and as a dancer. In order to maintain maximum authenticity and respect, I will be meeting with several members of the Armed Forces, both current members and veterans, in order to paint a genuine picture of wartime and its effects for myself. I will also be consulting with these people regarding creative/story choices I am making in the WAR Dance Trilogy to make sure each story beat is purposeful, respectful, and impactful.
As mentioned previously, a portion of the proceeds from this campaign and the eventual release event will go towards benefiting Mission22. I believe M22's programs are the embodiment of what I am trying to accomplish with this project, and I think that with our combined efforts, we can make real strides in the war against veteran suicide and PTSD. My hope is to make even the smallest stride towards reducing the number of veteran suicides and to help the effort to fight PTSD and raise awareness about issues that are not heavily discussed today, especially not in the Chicago dance community. If this project can help save just one life, then I've accomplished my goal.

Risks & Challenges
Choreography Process - I have been choreographing for several years now and have taught various classes in the Chicagoland area, Minnesota, and California. While I am a capable choreographer, I am by no means an expert nor would I consider myself ""fast"" at choreographing. I can foresee the largest roadblock to this project would be the creative process itself and challenging myself to create the most impactful choreography that I can. While I have no doubt in my mind I can get it done, it is moreso an issue of how fast I can get it done, which is why I have left ample time in my production timeline for choreography itself. However, my cast members have assured me that should I need any assistance whatsoever, I can lean on them for creative advice and collaboration, so I don't see this as a pressing issue in terms of production.
Authenticity - I recognize that I myself do not have experience in the subject matter discussed in WAR. As stated previously, I am a new member of the Armed Forces and do not have any combat experience under my belt. One of my utmost concerns is the need for authenticity and respectful storytelling in the execution of this project, which is why I have already mentioned that I will be consulting with fellow soldiers, veterans, and ambassadors from Mission22, the non-profit that I seek to help benefit through this project. No story beat will be executed without being vetted or advised upon by people that have real experience in this matter, as this trilogy will be nothing without respect for the demographic it seeks to help.
Deployment - Finally, the ideas and story behind this project were all based on my very real fear of getting deployed. My reserve unit is currently ""ready for deployment,"" which means I could get the call at any moment to leave within 30 days. This call could happen next week, next month, or not at all. While I am afraid, I am ready to fulfill my commitment as an Army Soldier and am currently steeling myself for the possibility of leaving home again soon. Should a deployment happen within the timeline of this production, all production will understandably cease until I return from my deployment. I ask for your understanding in this worst case scenario, as if it happens, there is nothing I can do to continue production while I am deployed. However, I am determined to bring this project to fruition no matter what happens, so production will continue as soon as I return home.

<h2>About the Show</h2>
<p>You're invited to the last sh*t show of the year, to revel in the deaths, divorces, deception and the miserable isolation of life. We've all been through some stuff and thrown some parties, and it just seems fitting to go out with a bang. There will be drugs. </p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>Here's the breakdown of what we need in order to make this production as successful as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're looking to raise about $1,200 for our production of <i>An Incomplete List... </i>Your contribution will support basic needs such as props, set materials, costume materials, and payment for our actors and production team. </li>
<li>Even if we don't make our goal, your contribution will still support our production, as any funds not received in donations will be coming out of the artists' personal finances. Thank you in advance for your kind donation!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past, <i>An Incomplete List... </i>was produced as part of the 2017 Philadelphia Fringe Festival.

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>The Sunday Art Club (TSAC) is a two-part platform we launched in the summer of 2020, comprising a monthly live event showcasing multidisciplinary art from diverse artists.</p>
<p>Artist-led, we passionately believe in advocating for grassroots artists and connecting them with audiences craving a place to discover and enjoy new artists, art and performances.</p>
<p>In the months since TSAC began we’ve programmed an array of brilliant performances ranging from musicians, such as Jordana Mba &amp; Kaia Vieira, to Spoken Word Poet Marta Luné, and Performance Artist Kollier Din-Bangura. We also launched a ‘Platform Talks’ series in August 2020, a spotlight style interview segment that hit the ground running with veteran artists Dollie Henry &amp; Paul Jenkins, founders of Body of People Jazz Theatre Company.        <br/> These are but a few talented artists out of the 52 that we’ve platformed so far, (some established in their own right), who deserve to have their work and voices amplified. Our mission is to connect them with audiences who also have a yearning for real grassroots art.</p>
<p>Our event garnered the interest of local and national publications, such as The Upcoming and BBC radio, links below: </p>

<p><a href=""https://thesundayartclub.com/Home#home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheSundayArtClub.com</a></p>
<p>TSAC is a two-part platform, the first part is an Event scheduled for the last Sunday of every month and centred around:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Intimate performances.</li>
<li>A platform showcasing both undiscovered and established talent.</li>
<li>A curated experience of real grassroots art.</li>
<li>A scratch space for artists of all disciplines to explore new work in front of a live audience.</li>
<li>Live interviews with veteran artists and change makers in the arts industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second part is a digital platform that we’ve begun building which aims to be: </p>
<ul>
<li>A digital hub for grassroots culture globally allowing us to expand our reach beyond the U.K.</li>
<li>A collection of works, performances &amp; interviews available online, anytime or location.</li>
<li>A finger-on-the-pulse community arts space accessible 365 days a year. </li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to preserve our quality and our pledge to showcasing the best undiscovered and emerging talent, we need the funds to organise production, and grow the platform's reach through targeted marketing whilst paying artists fairly.</p>
<p>We have set our initial goal at £2,500 because we are keen to iterate rapidly in this time of great need for the arts and most importantly, grassroots representation. Reaching this goal would allow us to invest in targeted marketing, basic production costs (transportation and Covid-19 PPE) and reserve cash for artist expenses. </p>
<p>However, in order to become the force for change we aspire to represent, our stretch goals are the desired target.</p>
<p><font>For example, the Budget Breakdown below details the costs to produce a Digital performance. </font></p>
<p><font>Pay at the U.K. National Living Wage is what we can achieve throughout 2021 if we reach our Stretch Goal of £12,500; producing both live/digital performances each month. </font></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621346483/r4ly7zvjwtbelxbqeyob.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><font>The Breakdown below is calculated at industry rates arts (Equity &amp; BECTU) and is reflective of an artist/creative's cost of living, frequency of work opportunities, and requires more funding.</font></p>
<p><font>Reaching our Stretch Goals of £25,000 and beyond will allow us to implement a comprehensive strategy (hiring qualified professionals in roles such as marketing) preparing the platform for 2022.</font></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621346455/veat7vr3tfzcb6r5gcvx.jpg"" src=""""/>The Stretch Goals at £7,500, £12,500, £25,000 and £40,000 reflect the true costs involved in establishing a live/digital art event that punches above its weight and produces content comparable to that of industry giants.</p>
<p>Reaching these Stretch Goals will allow us to attract additional sponsorship and a more sustainable funding structure that enables The Sunday Art Club to become an event of excellence. A successfully funded campaign will give us 6 months to build upon the successes of 2020 and implement the best strategy to achieve a thriving platform in 2022.  </p>
<p>You, our amazing backers can fund this endeavour by making a one-off contribution or collecting a Perk. Some perks will give you discounted access to TSAC when we re-open this summer and others will grant you behind the scenes participation and even an Executive Producer role. Perk to Consider: Summer Live Event Pass.</p>
<p>International backers are encouraged to see TSAC as a global platform that could be producing live events internationally as early as 2022. Even with our work focused in London and the U.K. at present, it's very important that we connect with international artists through our digital platform and showcase a wide range of stories. Perk to Consider: Summer Live-Stream Pass.</p>
<p>We vow to keep The Sunday Art Club Artist-led and will always be answerable to the artists and audiences that support us, ensuring that the individual is heard and championed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will TSAC's Impact be?</h3>
<p>We launched TSAC in the summer of 2020 just as the first Covid-19 national lockdown in the U.K. eased and are proud to say that both July and August editions sold out. We programmed more than 30 performances involving over 50 artists. Our September edition saw great ticket sales (our first attempt at monetising the event) before being cut short by new Covid-19 safety measures.</p>
<p>On a local level, TSAC will be a hub for artists and community to come together and celebrate grassroots art, reconnecting audiences' relationship to art and expanding representation across the many art forms.</p>
<p>On an international and global level, artists will be given a platform to reach a much larger audience, particularly audiences who are actively seeking to engage with performers sidelined from mainstream performance.</p>
<p>Whilst success means different things to different people, we want to mandate our success in the championing of grassroots artists and the providing of appropriate support. Beyond this, we absolutely want to be a force for change straddling both the commercial world of live entertainment and the artistic fringe environment that often produces the best artistic voices.</p>
<p>The Sunday Art Club will be our way of democratizing art and connecting diverse stories with diverse audiences.</p>
<p>Join the movement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest and most immediate hurdle is Covid-19 and the lasting effects that prohibit the entertainment industry from holding large events.</p>
<p>Drawing on the expertise of Khaos Artistic Director James Scotland who has worked as an Actor/Director/ Producer in theatre (West End, Fringe) and film for over a decade, our team will focus on the quality of performance and representation of diverse artists, ensuring that both can be delivered to audiences within Covid-19 guidelines as they change and keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>In-line with established theatres and online streaming services, Creative Director Marwa Ayari will connect and grow our audience nationally and internationally through our digital platform making TSAC a secure investment in the face of Covid-19 and a vital force in Covid recovery for the freelancers most affected within the arts industry.</p>
<p>We don't run the risk of losing funds to Covid-19 as any work that needs to be created in isolation and or with strict Covid-19 guidelines can be adhered to, allowing us to place equal focus on the development of our online platform. </p>

</div></div>","Our Campaign
The Sunday Art Club (TSAC) is a two-part platform we launched in the summer of 2020, comprising a monthly live event showcasing multidisciplinary art from diverse artists.
Artist-led, we passionately believe in advocating for grassroots artists and connecting them with audiences craving a place to discover and enjoy new artists, art and performances.
In the months since TSAC began we’ve programmed an array of brilliant performances ranging from musicians, such as Jordana Mba & Kaia Vieira, to Spoken Word Poet Marta Luné, and Performance Artist Kollier Din-Bangura. We also launched a ‘Platform Talks’ series in August 2020, a spotlight style interview segment that hit the ground running with veteran artists Dollie Henry & Paul Jenkins, founders of Body of People Jazz Theatre Company.         These are but a few talented artists out of the 52 that we’ve platformed so far, (some established in their own right), who deserve to have their work and voices amplified. Our mission is to connect them with audiences who also have a yearning for real grassroots art.
Our event garnered the interest of local and national publications, such as The Upcoming and BBC radio, links below: 
The Upcoming - The Future of Inclusive Theatre
Islington Gazette - Sunday Art Club
Broadway World - Outdoor Festival The Sunday Art Club

TSAC is a two-part platform, the first part is an Event scheduled for the last Sunday of every month and centred around:  

Intimate performances.
A platform showcasing both undiscovered and established talent.
A curated experience of real grassroots art.
A scratch space for artists of all disciplines to explore new work in front of a live audience.
Live interviews with veteran artists and change makers in the arts industry.

The second part is a digital platform that we’ve begun building which aims to be: 

A digital hub for grassroots culture globally allowing us to expand our reach beyond the U.K.
A collection of works, performances & interviews available online, anytime or location.
A finger-on-the-pulse community arts space accessible 365 days a year. 

See our Concept productions below for a look at the artists and stories we've featured so far.
Music Sessions - Roxana & Jorma - Carnal Hell
Visual Art Series - Katja Larsson
Theatre Series - Macbeth: BEIRUT

What We Need & What You Get
In order to preserve our quality and our pledge to showcasing the best undiscovered and emerging talent, we need the funds to organise production, and grow the platform's reach through targeted marketing whilst paying artists fairly.
We have set our initial goal at £2,500 because we are keen to iterate rapidly in this time of great need for the arts and most importantly, grassroots representation. Reaching this goal would allow us to invest in targeted marketing, basic production costs (transportation and Covid-19 PPE) and reserve cash for artist expenses. 
However, in order to become the force for change we aspire to represent, our stretch goals are the desired target.
For example, the Budget Breakdown below details the costs to produce a Digital performance. 
Pay at the U.K. National Living Wage is what we can achieve throughout 2021 if we reach our Stretch Goal of £12,500; producing both live/digital performances each month. 

The Breakdown below is calculated at industry rates arts (Equity & BECTU) and is reflective of an artist/creative's cost of living, frequency of work opportunities, and requires more funding.
Reaching our Stretch Goals of £25,000 and beyond will allow us to implement a comprehensive strategy (hiring qualified professionals in roles such as marketing) preparing the platform for 2022.
The Stretch Goals at £7,500, £12,500, £25,000 and £40,000 reflect the true costs involved in establishing a live/digital art event that punches above its weight and produces content comparable to that of industry giants.
Reaching these Stretch Goals will allow us to attract additional sponsorship and a more sustainable funding structure that enables The Sunday Art Club to become an event of excellence. A successfully funded campaign will give us 6 months to build upon the successes of 2020 and implement the best strategy to achieve a thriving platform in 2022.  
You, our amazing backers can fund this endeavour by making a one-off contribution or collecting a Perk. Some perks will give you discounted access to TSAC when we re-open this summer and others will grant you behind the scenes participation and even an Executive Producer role. Perk to Consider: Summer Live Event Pass.
International backers are encouraged to see TSAC as a global platform that could be producing live events internationally as early as 2022. Even with our work focused in London and the U.K. at present, it's very important that we connect with international artists through our digital platform and showcase a wide range of stories. Perk to Consider: Summer Live-Stream Pass.
We vow to keep The Sunday Art Club Artist-led and will always be answerable to the artists and audiences that support us, ensuring that the individual is heard and championed.

What will TSAC's Impact be?
We launched TSAC in the summer of 2020 just as the first Covid-19 national lockdown in the U.K. eased and are proud to say that both July and August editions sold out. We programmed more than 30 performances involving over 50 artists. Our September edition saw great ticket sales (our first attempt at monetising the event) before being cut short by new Covid-19 safety measures.
On a local level, TSAC will be a hub for artists and community to come together and celebrate grassroots art, reconnecting audiences' relationship to art and expanding representation across the many art forms.
On an international and global level, artists will be given a platform to reach a much larger audience, particularly audiences who are actively seeking to engage with performers sidelined from mainstream performance.
Whilst success means different things to different people, we want to mandate our success in the championing of grassroots artists and the providing of appropriate support. Beyond this, we absolutely want to be a force for change straddling both the commercial world of live entertainment and the artistic fringe environment that often produces the best artistic voices.
The Sunday Art Club will be our way of democratizing art and connecting diverse stories with diverse audiences.
Join the movement.

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest and most immediate hurdle is Covid-19 and the lasting effects that prohibit the entertainment industry from holding large events.
Drawing on the expertise of Khaos Artistic Director James Scotland who has worked as an Actor/Director/ Producer in theatre (West End, Fringe) and film for over a decade, our team will focus on the quality of performance and representation of diverse artists, ensuring that both can be delivered to audiences within Covid-19 guidelines as they change and keep everyone safe.
In-line with established theatres and online streaming services, Creative Director Marwa Ayari will connect and grow our audience nationally and internationally through our digital platform making TSAC a secure investment in the face of Covid-19 and a vital force in Covid recovery for the freelancers most affected within the arts industry.
We don't run the risk of losing funds to Covid-19 as any work that needs to be created in isolation and or with strict Covid-19 guidelines can be adhered to, allowing us to place equal focus on the development of our online platform.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The Cuckoo's Theater Project is a non-profit theater company producing works in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. We are currently in the midst of our 5th season, but we need your help to continue. TCTP is encountered countless roadblocks to get to this anniversary season, and only with your support will we be able to continue. By donating today, you will ensure that TCTP can follow through with our 5th season (see season productions below) as well as renovate our venue at 7077 N Ashland Avenue. This is a pivotal time for The Cuckoo's Theater Project. We could not be where we are today without support from our patrons and donors, but we are now asking for your generous support in our time of need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Mission Statement: </i></p>
<p>The Cuckoo's Theater Project produces works that expose the discomforts of human nature. By navigating the struggle as a community, we seek to find light within the darkness in hopes of creating a brighter future. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to do two things:</p>
<p>1. Ensure we can successfully finish the remaining two shows in our season.</p>
<p>2. Make the first venue of our building into a quality, licensed, and rentable space not only for TCTP but for other storefront theaters and the Rogers Park community.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have two shows left in our 5th season: <i>Missed Opportunities</i> by Jillian Leff and <i>Calorie Counters </i>by Molly Wagner. Both of these shows are world premieres.</p>
<p>We need your help to make these amazing shows happen. By donating, you can also receive complimentary tickets and other perks to see your contribution in effect. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>""The Nest"" is the nickname for the Cuckoo's building at 7077 N Ashland Avenue. The building was purchased in 2016 by our managing director and donated to TCTP. The building was originally home to the Rogers Park Women's Center and later converted into a church. The first floor of the building will house a primary 50-seat performance space (which can be used both traditionally and in the round), a small rehearsal space, a dance studio, a set construction room, and offices. The second floor will be a large 100-seat performance space, costume and prop storage (for rentals), and individual studio spaces. </p>
<p>Our initial goal is for the downstairs venue to become a usable space. Many of the key elements are already existing, but paint, a light-grid, and dressing room renovations are currently needed in order to finish this project. With the first space done, TCTP will finally have a home. But equally important: a large number of small performing arts organizations will have a local, affordable place to present their own art. We want this space to be a legacy for The Cuckoo's Theater Project, but also be an important part of the Rogers Park arts scene for the countless organizations that are based here. </p>

</div><div>
<p>Your contribution to TCTP will not only preserve Rogers Park arts, but will also stabilize many other artists and arts organizations in the area. Below, we've listed some of the most important reasons for you to donate today:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCTP staff and company have a proven track record of the drive and motivation that it takes to run a non-profit theater company. We started with little knowledge, little money, and only a few people. We have since become a company with a strong, knowledgeable staff and a dedicated core of company members who have fallen in love with the company and what we do. </li>
<li>The Nest was always going to be a challenge from the start. Of course, the gift of this building was amazing, but we've lacked the resources and backing to complete the project. However, we are incredibly close to finishing the first space: by searching for donations of seating, building our own in-the-round stage, and volunteering time to clean and organize. </li>
<li>We have always had a dedication to our community. Having been born and bred in Rogers Park, we struggled with the fact that there were little-to-no affordable venue options in the neighborhood. We want The Nest to be a place for the whole community to gather and to foster creativity in every way. </li>
<li>Season 5 is about identity. TCTP is now beginning to have their own identity and share with Chicago. By continuing our season, we are learning more about ourselves and showing our audience how to learn more about themselves and each other. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In order to fully produce the world premiere of Calorie Counters, we are reaching out to our friends, fellow artists, and supportive network to raise the funds we need to realize our full artistic vision. We are creating this campaign to help us offset the costs of producing a show, and your generous donation will allow us to pay our performers and designers that will allow us to fully fund this production.

A video of Terminator 2, bought by my mother from Asda (I remember trying to pronounce the name Schwarzenegger on the cassette case to no avail), was the straw that broke the camel's back. I no longer wanted to watch the screen; I wanted to be in the screen.

However, the lengths that she and her cast of closest friends must go to in order to achieve artistic excellence will irrevocably change how they see the world, and themselves. Prepare for a journey like no other!Here is the ticket link for our event: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/redgates-presents-...Check out this feature on MyTheatreMates: https://mytheatremates.com/howtosavetheworld-ne...And check out our Facebook Event page!: https://www.facebook.com/events/2457746194245692/Thank you so much for coming onto this page. Your simple click has already made a world of difference! Who knows, there might be a reward waiting for you at the bottom of this page...Yep, that's me. My name is Patrick Bayele. I am an actor, writer, director, and I am about to graduate with a First-Class degree in Film Studies and Comparative Literature from Queen Mary University Of London. Having been raised by three parents - my mother, father, and VHS system - I have loved and revelled in visual storytelling before I uttered my first words (at the age of 5). A video of Terminator 2, bought by my mother from Asda (I remember trying to pronounce the name Schwarzenegger on the cassette case to no avail), was the straw that broke the camel's back. I no longer wanted to watch the screen; I wanted to be in the screen. I turned to local performing arts in my area - acting, singing and dance - and it only took a matter of sessions, and the role of Leroy in Bugsy Malone, to seal my future and my passion in storytelling. I have never looked back. ...And here we are.16 years later, and currently 22 years old - mature, grizzled, and with an unrivalled sense of humour - I am now part of Identity Agency Group, the same agency as John Boyega and Letitia Wright, and the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain, a charity which has nurtured hundreds of influential artists. Since 2015, I have performed at Shaftesbury Theatre, Wilton's Music Hall, The Royal Court and the Criterion Theatre in anniversary specials, educational workshops and world premieres. Many, many industry professionals such as Paul Roseby OBE, Femi Oguns MBE, Lynette Linton, Juliet Knight and Sita Thomas, have commended me for my commitment, rigour, professionalism, undying focus and my invincible vibe. Function, directed by Lynette Linton (currently the Artistic Director at the Bush Theatre), written by Sophie Ellerby, performed at the Criterion Theatre - what a show!How To Save The World is the culmination of everything I have learned ever since I began performing all those moons ago, and this show marks our entry into the realm of excellence. I have written several pieces for Theatre, TV, Film, and I frequently collaborate with Redgates Theatre - run by Callum Tilling, our guardian angel for this production - in helping to direct the critically-acclaimed Gateways showcases. I established my artistic company - Pat On The Back Productions - in 2017, after having staged No Good, the third play that I have written, acted in and directed. How To Save The World is my fifth self-written play - and by far my most ambitious. Being personally invited to meet the cast of Black Panther - I look so goofy!Moscow theatre raves with the gang - for the win!However, it was my six-week acting term at the Moscow Art Theatre School in 2018 which changed me irrevocably, as an artist and as a person. Having been immersed in such a distinct culture, I learned that there is no rulebook for telling stories.This adaptation of The Seagull, directed by Yuriy Butusov, burnt the rulebook right in front of me.As a person who has endured adversity, loss and heartbreak, I felt that The Seagull by Anton Chekhov - a personal favourite, and a play which solidified the prestige of the Moscow Art Theatre School at the turn of the 20th century - was the perfect vehicle to tell a modern day story about 21st century humanity. Our intention with the play is to find something beautiful amidst the haze of our reality; we want things to change for the better, once and for all - all of us do. But in order to save the world, we must become who we are destined to be. This is a story of what it means to be human.Looking out over the Baltic Sea in Peterhof, St. Petersburg - the future is out there.We are a cast of Queen Mary students, with the majority of us having studied drama. What's funny is that we often experience overlaps with our lives and the lives of the characters, and this brings us closer to the story at hand, and brings us even closer together as a cast. We all collaborate through the theatre committee, but this is a story which I felt had to be taken outside of Queen Mary, so it could be showcased on a much wider scale. We have been working tirelessly to honour this story as much as possible, and we show no signs of stopping until we strike that set on the 31st, or perhaps even after this date! Help us in our journey by donating to our project, so you and I, through a story about actors - those people who are brilliant at playing other people, but never themselves - can; illustrate a new way of building identities, foster unconditional love amongst our diverse, divided communities, and usher in a dawn of a new theatre. How To Save The World is not only an adaptation of a masterpiece - it is a play that marks the beginning of a world of infinite possibilities through self-discovery, authentic passion, and a genuine belief in an ideal world. By contributing, you will aid us in eradicating a world so devoid of hope, that the only cry of resilience we can muster is 'that is the way it is', and you will bring us closer towards the great beyond of our generation.It starts now - help us save the world.Our excellent cast, from left to right: Archie Brown, Beatrice Olivier, Shavariya Padayachee, Patrick Bayele, Alfie Noble, Maria Messias Mendes, Rosie Hodgson and James Garnham. What We Need & What You GetRedgates and Pat On The Back - partners in crime!As the project has progressed, our total expenditure stands at an estimate of £9680. Whilst this was initially larger, it has been due to the good will of our associates and collaborators who have offered additional services or provided their assistance with little to no charge that the overall cost has decreased. Their contribution is invaluable to us, and will always be remembered.  A substantial amount of capital has been amassed personally over the years, and this capital will be used to pay cast members and collaborating practitioners. With this page, we are asking for £1500 to help cover what reaches outside of our own pockets. However, as we have applied for further funding from other sources, we are launching this indiegogo not only to meet the demands of the production, but also to involve you, our audience, in its creation, so we can all truly develop a universal story and mould an everlasting cultural staple for everyone. Through this page, we aim to cover the cost of certain expenditures, those being:
The cost of making our play accessible (hiring extra chairs, props and platforms) (£1000).
Paying the salaries of technicians (£350).
Acquiring props (£150).

We have three tiers: Awesome Donors, Premium Donors and Badass Donors! Our Badass tier will be uploaded as the show approaches...Premium donors who contribute £50 or more will receive: 

Deluxe copies of the script - Copies of our technical scripts in all the different draft versions, with amendments and notes, all signed by every member of our cast - they'll be worth a pretty penny in the future! This also includes Blessed They Be Damned, the very play which Keira, the protagonist, writes for the London Student Drama Festival, the competition she is driven to win throughout the story. That's all we'll say on that; we really have gone the extra mile to make this story as brilliant as possible!

How on earth did we create How To Save The World? This blueprint will give you all the answers and so, so much more.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>~Lé Carnaval~</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Derive from a passion to revive Indonesia Pantomime Arts, Septian Dwi Cahyo, Indonesia Pantomime Maestro, Since 2012 came with the idea of ""FunToMime"", to send messages to the society. Mime is <i>Fun</i>. Pantomime isn't that hard. It can be done by anyone, anywhere, anytime. We prove them in a stage play. Practices are more effective than theories, they say.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Under Septian Dwi Cahyo and Louis Lie MasterMime’s supervision, Surabaya Pantomime Community is cooperating with HOME Theater, Jonie SQL (API Comedian from Surabaya), Broomstick Theater (Student Activity Unit of Petra Christian University), and Art College Students from Surabaya State University (UNESA) presents FunToMime Surabaya in a storyline entitled ""Lé Carnaval"". Hand in hand, to bring Indonesia Pantomime towards a higher level.</p>

<h3>OTHELLO</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, a hot white man named William Shakespeare sat down and wrote a play about a hot black man, thus kicking off a long history of writers overstepping the boundaries of their lived experience. </p>

<h3>About Terianne </h3>
<p>My name is Terianne Falcone and I am a long-time actress and comedienne. I love performing ‘Good Grief: Stories at 207 West 88th Street’ because of the compassion it evokes in audiences, and I believe compassion can go a long way in our society today. </p>
<p>I have been involved in many aspects of acting since the 90’s—television, film, radio and more New York off-Broadway shows than I can count. Being Will Ferrell's over-the-top Italian girlfriend on Saturday Night Live was a highlight, but my greatest joy came when I started creating my own work with the financial support of Artistic New Directions theatre company in New York where the late great Gary Austin of Groundlings fame became my mentor and director. </p>
<p>More recently I lived in Rome while performing and teaching acting and improvisation. I now live in Brighton, England, and what better way to introduce Bruna (the character in the video above!)  to the UK than at the incredible Brighton Fringe Festival. The work has gotten some nice reviews: latest from GScene, a local LGBT magazine, wrote: ""She holds the stage magnetically and magnificently, and her true skill is in bringing out their humanity and making the point that grief can be good."" </p>
<h3>Real people, real stories</h3>
<p>I am passionate about this show because the stories I tell are from real people from my time living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. I felt compelled to write them down. There’s bespectacled ""Mona"" who came to see a room I had for rent, an elderly cab driver with a shocking story about World War II, Emily from a girls’ sleepover and a shocking tale from a New York Times headline. </p>
<p>Then there’s Bruna, the main character, the heart of the show. She's the outlandish, but wise, outrageous, but lovable elderly Italian superintendent of the building at 207 West 88th Street. ""I'ma de soup of de build!"" she says. Audiences fall in love with her. She is based on a real life Bruna who actually had a husband named Bruno. She was rough on the edges but ultimately kind. She stirs up a lot of feeling in audiences. </p>

<h3>What the show needs and what you get</h3>
<p>There are many expenses involved such as registration fees, promotional expenses, marketing, props, hiring items and services. </p>
<p>By contributing you will not just be helping the show but the communities around it. Theatre is powerful; it's healing. I've had members of the public come up to me in tears, thanking me because one of the stories reflected their own life.</p>
<p>And the silly, fun perks -- something to make you feel ""Spesh"" as Bruna would say! From a specialized video greeting from Bruna to a live meeting with her; to a personalized song to your own show! Take a look on the right and see what makes you smile most!</p>

And the silly, fun perks -- something to make you feel ""Spesh"" as Bruna would say! From a specialized video greeting from Bruna to a live meeting with her; to a personalized song to your own show! Take a look on the right and see what makes you smile most!

<p><strong>Why ""Cash In Your Blessings""? </strong></p>
<p>As children, we’re all told to dream big and strive for greatness and to fulfill our dreams…this is my dream. I’ve had a joy of writing since forever. From I was a little girl, reading and writing has been my favorite pastime. If I wasn't busy climbing mango trees, playing hopscotch or racing with my cousins and friends, I was reading a book or writing one in my notebook. I published my first children's book when I was ten years old, and by published, I mean I wrote a story about animals and I used the box from my Animal Crackers snack as the book cover. Let’s just say that was one of my most memorable summers ever. I really wished someone had kept my one and only copy. So, writing has been a lifelong interest of mine. Having wrote this stage play and to see it in production would be making a dream come true for me. However, I need your help to make it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Now?</strong></p>
<p>Now, because I want to stop procrastinating and doubting myself that this can really happen. That this gal from the islands can achieve such goals. A quote I like from the late Dr. Myles Monroe is, “the greatest tragedy in life is not death, but a life without purpose.” Writing this play is part of my purpose. Not only will producing this stage play fulfill one of my dreams – but also those of the actors and other members on the production team.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve quickly discovered writing my first stage play may have been the easiest part. There’s so much that goes into producing a stage play, things that I wasn’t aware of. Which is why I’m needing help to produce a professional stage play. Money raised will go towards covering production expenses, such as: venue fees, design costs, marketing costs, consultation, insurance, paying actors, and other production crew, etc. My hope is to have the first show in the Fall of 2018 at a local theater in Maryland or Washington, DC. Any donation amount would be greatly appreciated, and I will forever be grateful to you for your assistance.</p>

<h3>It's Alive!!! (about our Creation)</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We are a group of various actors, writers, artists, theatre enthusiast. indie film makers, costumers &amp; musicians in the New Orleans area.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Upon moving to this Darkly Romantic area to finally discover and delve into the Creole Roots my family had always talked about, I (Lazlo Aluisa) had expected to find (amongst the ever so present &amp; thriving art/entertainment scene) some kind of Late Night Horror Theatre. Local writer Ann Rice had so vividly depicted her ""Theatre of the Vampires"" in her now classic novel ""Interview With the Vampire,"" that it just seemed natural that there would be something like this. However, to my disappointment, no such or similar outlet existed. Over the years, time and time again, I have heard so many original and vital artists &amp; musicians say that what inspired them was just as much what they were ""not"" seeing/hearing and so they decided to become  advocates for what they longed for. This resonated  deeply with me. So I took their cue and decide to create such an outlet. Having a love for other genres other than just vampires this is what I came up with as my own contribution. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>To say that ""I"" came up with this is a huge understatement. At best this is quite simply a continuation to a long tradition of great and terrible stories going as far back as cave paintings, and that has inspired everything from the earliest campfire stories, mythology, religion, as well as classic and modern works of literature, theatre &amp; film. We (the troupe) only hope that our contributions to these mediums can add something of value. The ""I"" in that statement is, of course, also overshadowed by my collogues... one of the most fantastic groups of creative individuals that I have ever known . Such individuals are so awe inspiring to me. I am so fortunate &amp; blessed to be working with them and hope that you know, my fellow theatre enthusiast, that it would mean so much to me if you would not only support my efforts but theirs as well.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We ReallyNeed Help With &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<ul><li>The beauty of what we are trying to achieve is that SO MUCH OF IT IS ALREADY PAID FOR. A local venue that we are proud to call home (on the Heart of Bourbon Street) is so inspired by what we are putting together that they have vowed to give us the whole third floor of their Creole Townhouse Venue RENT FREE as long as we are producing such entertainment and as long as we contribute the sound system, lights, talent, content, and patrons. They  know that there is nothing else like this that is currently being produced in the region. They feel so confident that this is going to contribute so much to their venue that they are even building the stage for it. However, even though we have their vote of confidence and are so close to fulfilling our end of things, there are some fundamental things that we still need to obtain to get up and running on our end and to add a certain level of quality to it all.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We are asking anyone/everyone who is so inspired to donate a minimum of $20 or even more if you can. Smaller donations are, of course, welcome and most appreciated as well for those of you who are in a pinch yet would still like to contribute.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Locals</strong> (in the New Orleans Area): You will get a set of free tableside seating passes to a show and will be told where they can obtain free general admission passes anytime that you would like to attend a show. You will get links to videos of full captured shows once we shoot them, edit them, and upload them to the web. You will also get a membership to the ""Rock Monster Social Club,"" which is a social club that will keep you informed on cool double feature film screenings, other underground music, art, and theatre events, as well as a card that you can use to eat and drink for major discounts in select local venues (sometimes as much as 50% off).</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Non-Locals: </strong>You<strong> </strong>will get<strong> </strong>links to videos of full captured shows once we shoot them, edit them, and upload them to the web. You will also get everything promised to locals if/whenever you visit the area. You will be invited to join the Facebook group of the ""Rock Monster Social Club"" that will keep you informed on what is going on with the project. If/when you come to town you will also get a temporary membership card that will keep you informed on cool double feature film screenings, other underground music, art, and theatre events to check out while you are here in town and that you can use to eat and drink for major discounts in select local venues while you are here in town.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>The funds raised</strong> will mostly go to technical aspects, sets, costuming, and makeup (the performers will make their pay off of tickets sold and ""pass the hat"" donations). We have sound and lights taken care of but need to get a laptop and a few tablet computers to control the software that controls the sound and lights. We aim to also obtain a ""backline"" of musical amps and equipment so that not only will the house band not have to load gear in &amp; out every night but so we can also put on some cool underground music shows on nights where we do not do the theatre. We also have some reusable sets pieces to build, some costumes to make/obtain, and some theatrical and special fx make up to purchase. Any extra or leftover funds will be used to continue to make set pieces, costumes, and obtain makeup.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Not many risks because, as previously pointed out, we have a venue that is willing to give the room RENT FREE as long as we are producing. We have a great marketing plan that includes many associate partners that are ready to get on board and help us network it.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>However, as mentioned, we are still behind on some of the things mentioned above and have a mid-October date that is pressing towards us. So we not only want to nail down all of our production needs but we want to impress upon the venue that we know what we are doing, can handle this, and that their vote of confidence in us is not in vain. So, once again, this is why we are appealing to you, our fellow art &amp; theatre enthusiasts.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3><i>black girl love: an adaptation project</i></h3>

<p>An adaptation of Anondra “Kat” Williams' book of short stories and poetry, black girl love looks at the everyday lives of black queer women and non-binary people. It's a play about our relationships to love, sex, and obsession. In the tradition of a choreo-poem, the show is non-linear and uses original poetry by Williams. black girl love captures the mundane and precious stories of black queer women and non-binary people who have been so long ignored in American theatre. The VORTEX and GenEnCo are pleased to produce this new play by Al(aina) L. Monts for three weeks only at The VORTEX.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Project Now</h3>
<p>In a time and place where it's common-place to hear people talking about ""end times,"" perhaps it is now more than ever that stories about the joy, love, and desire of historically marginalized people become vital to our survival. <i>black girl love</i> is about how black women love each other in complex, multi-faceted, problematic and celebratory ways. How often do we see queer black women just ""be,"" on screen or onstage</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How We Will Use These Funds</h3>
<p>Donations from this campaign will go directly toward paying creative collaborators, that are mostly Black women, and all women or transpeople. We have already received a grant from the City of Austin, which will cover much of our talent and materials costs. We are grateful to The VORTEX for underwriting our project through providing performance space and other material goods so we can direct most of our resources toward paying talent. GenEnCo has steadily been raising its artists' stipends over the last few years. The $2000 will insure that trend continues. It is the goal of the Generic Ensemble Company to make creative labor sustainable for all collaborators. Love makes art good, but you can't eat it. Money helps.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's Talk About Radical Rush</h3>
<p>We are so proud to be partnering with The VORTEX on their Radical Rush program that reserves a bloc of free tickets in the spirit of sustainability, accessibility, and participating in the gift economy. Radical Rush tickets are released an hour before the performance starts--first come first serve. Your donation to this campaign allows us to offer our show to all patrons, regardless of their socio-economic status. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Are So Cool</h3>
<p>The Generic Ensemble Company (GenEnCo) is one of the few troupes in Austin, and nationally, that centers queer people of color bodies and experiences in physically engaged, experimental, ensemble-based performance. GenEnCo has some grants and awards under its belt, and director, kt shorb, has presented work nationally.

One particular shot, of a baby whale who had been poisoned as a result of toxins passed on to it from it’s mother, because the mother had been poisoned by micro-plastics. We agreed at that moment that we wanted to do something to help save the seas, and to stop things like this from happening.</p><p>There are many skills that would be useful in taking direct action, but I possessed none of them. What I had were skills in magic, comedy, scriptwriting and juggling, and over a decade of performing experience, including ten years of touring schools in Italy with a company called Action Theatre in English, with shows teaching the English language. What Felicity had was a large amount of knowledge if marine life, years of experience presenting talks on fossils and marine creatures to school groups with Island Gems Fossil Hunts, and a childhood desire to be a mermaid. </p><p>That evening, Fliss the Mermaid, Curios Aquatica and our mission of ‘Saving Our Seas Through Education And Entertainment’ were born!</p><p>Since then we have created our first educational school show, had our first performance, which was wonderfully well received, and a little over a month since we announced the launch of Curios Aquatica we have already raised over £100 for our first nominated marine charity, the Marine Conservation Society UK, mostly from Greg replacing ‘passing the hat’ with him passing a collection pot for the charity after shows at two Steampunk festivals.</p><p>But now, Fliss the Mermaid needs your help!</p><p><br/><b><u>What We Need… And What You Get!</u></b></p><p><br/>Fliss and I leapt into creating these shows, and we wanted this to be an all-new show, not reusing any of my old tricks and props, and so tricks, props, puppets, a set, and of course a tail all had to be obtained! We called in family favours to get the set painted and some of the set dressing added, and worked hard ourselves to keep the cost down. We also knew that the show had to impress, and in particular that Fliss the Mermaid had to look her best, and so (in the words of John Hammond from one of our favourite films), we spared no expense in setting up the show, and in the end this show cost us over £4000 to put together – a worthwhile investment for the cause we are trying to help! However, with our wedding approaching and real life things needing to be paid for as well, we have really reached our budget limit for the show. Now we have a show with an important message, which means a lot to us personally, and we feel to the world as a whole, and we need help to raise the extra money we need to promote the show, let people know it exists, and start getting it booked into schools and other appropriate places across the UK… and who knows, maybe even beyond!</p><p>We are putting time into creating what we can on a zero budget campaign – website, emails, social media, etc, but we need some funds to really get the word out. For example:</p><p>•    Advertising in teaching magazines. We have managed to secure a deal with The Teacher magazine for a discount on advertising, but even a simple advert will still cost £180 for a single  edition – more if we want a more noticeable size or position.<br/>•    Leaflets. Greg performs at events across the country with his stage-tricycle, and has a leaflet rack on that where people take leaflets for both his shows and our Steampunk web series The Last Airship – and we have a number of traders at events who are kind enough to take stacks of these leaflets and help distribute them at events Greg can’t be at. We are planning to piggyback on this marketing by creating a three-fold leaflet incorporating the stage-tricycle, The Last Airship and Curios Aquatica. This way anyone interested in either of the other two takes home information on Curios Aquatica too! To get 10,000 good quality three-fold flyers professionally designed and printed will coat about £290.</p><p>As you can see, leaflets and a one month advert uses up almost all of our initial goal amount of £500, which is why we have our first stretch goal of £1000!</p><p>•    We would be able to start to negotiate deals for advertising in multiple editions of magazines.<br/>•    We can start to write letters and send our information to schools by post – still one of the best ways to get information out. With a second class stamp costing 56p, by the time you factor in stationary it costs over £60 for every 100 letters!</p><p>Beyond this, every penny adds to the level of advertising and promotion we can achieve, and allows us to get our shows into more schools and other venues, and teach more people about the harm being done to the oceans, and how we can help! All the way up to our second, way-out-there stretch goal... £2000.</p><p>•   We would be able to expand our video promotions with better underwater filming equipment.</p><p>•   We would be able to negotiate on a full year of magazine adverts with improved placement.</p><p>Obviously even if we were to fall short on our initial goal, the show is ready, we would allocate what we did get to marketing in the best ways possible, and keep pushing our message!</p><p>So now you know what we need – how about your rewards!</p><p>£5 – A Friend of Fliss – You will get a thank you message, our gratitude, and the warm fuzzy feeling knowing that you have helped us spread our message.

Upon arrival to each country, each team of participants partners with a local contact and is housed for  the month. We work alongside the missionaries ministry and volunteer work.</p><h2>What type of ministries and volunteer work will I be doing?</h2><div>We will partner with orphanages, refugee camps, local churches, homeless shelters, minister to women and children trapped in prostitution as a result of human trafficking and other humanitarian organizations. Each country varies in the volunteer work we will be doing. I won't know until I arrive in each country. I am looking forward to be delightfully surprised by each type of volunteer work I will be doing. It will be especially moving to work amongst the poor, homeless, orphans, prostitutes, refugees, sick and burdened. It is an integral part for us to facilitate, support, serve and love people who are less fortunate then us. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1341948/files/20150331062742-wr-photo_boy_soccer_ball.png?1427808462"" src="""" style=""width: 619.157190635452px;height: 317px;""/></p>

I am twenty one years old and I am from Nova Scotia, Canada. I love to travel, hike, be outdoors, practice yoga, run half marathons, swim in the ocean and be amongst people. I have a tremendous heart for missions and volunteering. And this year I have decided to go on the World Race.What is the World Race?The World Race - is an eleven month mission trip where participants travel to eleven different countries partnering alongside missionaries and organizations within the host country. Upon arrival to each country, each team of participants partners with a local contact and is housed for  the month. We work alongside the missionaries ministry and volunteer work.What type of ministries and volunteer work will I be doing?We will partner with orphanages, refugee camps, local churches, homeless shelters, minister to women and children trapped in prostitution as a result of human trafficking and other humanitarian organizations. Each country varies in the volunteer work we will be doing. I won't know until I arrive in each country. I am looking forward to be delightfully surprised by each type of volunteer work I will be doing. It will be especially moving to work amongst the poor, homeless, orphans, prostitutes, refugees, sick and burdened. It is an integral part for us to facilitate, support, serve and love people who are less fortunate then us. 
I especially am looking forward to working in orphanages and with kids camps. I have a heart for children. I love delighting and seeing their fascination about the world. I have had the privilege on a couple of occasions to volunteer at kids camps. One in particular was in Bordeaux, France. We played sports, sang and had small group discussions.


Bordeaux, France. July 2012
I used to be a children's swim instructor and coach. I currently volunteer as a Sunday School teacher at my Church.
Another time enjoying the company of children in Egypt

                                                          Luxor, Egypt. May 2012

Where will I be going?

My World Race squad leaves in July 2015. We will be traveling to India, Nepal, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Botswana, Swaziland, South Africa, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Jamaica. The key reason that I was drawn to the World Race was because of its diversity. I love that I will have the opportunity to travel to eleven different countries, interacting with distinct cultures and serve others in a multitude of ways, over the course of a year.What will the funds be going to?The funding I receive through this campaign will cover all the costs of my plane tickets, other transportation costs, travel insurance, ministries, housing and food. It does not include my gear, vaccinations and extra money for outings while on the World Race.Why should I support Clare Howe's World Race?You believe that making a difference in lives that are less fortunate than ours is important. You love seeing people being provided with love and care through volunteering. Perhaps, deep down you would love to do the WR and are encouraged to support the cause. Either way, I appreciate it, you make my Race. What's in it for you?By supporting this campaign you will get the satisfaction of helping me depart on my World Race in July 2015. Dependant on the increments you donate you will receive a combination of a thank you card, two bracelets, a fridge magnet and a World Race t-shirt.  View the perks on the right hand side.

Our executive, directors, actors and crew are all volunteers and work for 3-6 months in rehearsals to bring shows we are passionate about to the community.<br/><br/>For many of the students, university or college is their first time away from home and the club provides a safe space where they can learn and create and grow. <br/><br/>The funds we are looking to raise will help cover the costs of our productions: show royalties, costumes, props, and sets. This previous year we had over fifty students involved in four productions and these funds will enable us to continue to grow and expand with our membership.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>More that just a flamenco company, <strong><a href=""https://www.mojacarflamenco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mojácar Flamenco</a> </strong>is the ongoing adventure of two artists, composer <strong><a href=""https://www.mojacarflamenco.com/stephen-dick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stephen Dick</a>,</strong> and choreographer <strong><a href=""https://www.mojacarflamenco.com/katerina-tomas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Katerina Tomás</a>,</strong> who share a passion for flamenco, creativity, expression and each other.</p>
<p>Since 1996, Mojácar Flamenco has been a unique voice in flamenco, blending traditional flamenco with elements of jazz, classical music, modern dance and theater.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>In June 2020, Mojacar Flamenco will present <a href=""https://www.mojacarflamenco.com/toque-jondo"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Toque Jondo,</strong></i></a> an evening of flamenco dance theater, based on the poetry of Federico Garcia Lorca and the music of Manuel De Falla, at the historic El Portal Theater in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Flamenco illuminates those moments that balance on a knife’s edge,  when love stares down fear and life conquers despair. With powerful rhythms, striking imagery and expressive storytelling, <strong>Toque Jondo</strong> blends flamenco with elements of opera, jazz and ballet to tell three stories about  lives suspended between love and despair.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cantan Los Fuegos: </strong>Manuel de Falla's classic story of love and betrayal, <i>El Amor Brujo</i> is reimagined as a flamenco jazz ballet driven by Latin rhythms with echoes of '60's  jazz.</li>
<li>
<strong>Romance Sonambulo: </strong>Based on Lorca's poem, this is a tragic story of two lovers separated at the edge of life, desperate to be reunited before they are enveloped in darkness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nana Del Caballo Grande:</strong> Based on the lullaby from Lorca's play, <i>Bodas de Sangre</i>, this piece tells the story of a young family traveling by night, surrounded by forces that threaten to destroy them.</li>

<li>Studio recording for ten musicians</li>
<li>Theater rental and professional support</li>
<li>Marketing and publicity expenses</li>

<h3>About ""Art""</h3>
<p>Dedicated to my brother, Samuel, who has Down Syndrome and continues to inspire me every single day. There's been a BIG leap in representation on TV and in Film for you, buddy. But the theatre...I only know of one play (a non-musical play) that was written <i>specifically</i> for an actor with Down Syndrome <a href=""https://www.samuelfrench.com/p/64325/amy-and-the-orphans"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(Lindsey Ferrentino's <i>Amy and the Orphans</i>)</a>.</p>
<p>New representation is so important for any person who rarely sees themselves on stage or screen. Theatre creates opportunities for expression. In fact, ""Art"" is all about expression - whether it's expression through paint or learning how to positively use your feelings. With that said, I have always felt a huge responsibility to be truthful in the art I make. It comes naturally to me to write about real people, real life situations. The characters are fictitious, but ""Art's"" themes of ignorance, stereotype, jealousy, resentment, <i>and</i> love are sewn into the fabric of our society today.</p>
<p>The story of ""Art"" has brotherhood at its core. One of them, David, is the popular guy - liked by everyone - but plagued by his own insecurities. The other, Arthur, is an incoming freshman in high school. Oh, and he happens to have Down Syndrome. After a decision is made allowing Arthur to join his peers at the public high school, will he find a way to express himself? Will David understand where he fits into a family like his own? Will their parents ever agree on Arthur's progress? </p>

<h3>Where We're At</h3>
<p>We have released our Demo Recordings! Feel free to head to our website, <a href=""https://www.artnewmusical.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>artnewmusical.com</strong></a> to download it! This was a labor of love and the performers featured are the most amazing. </p>
<ul>
<li>We have social media platforms (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) which gain new supporters each day.</li>
<li>Partnership with a fundraising platform to raise money for the <a href=""https://www.ndss.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>National Down Syndrome Society</strong></a>.</li>
<li>A first draft of our script has been finished, rounding out our one act, 90-minute musical.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where We Hope To Be (with your help!)</h3>
<p>We want to put our Demo Recording on iTunes, Spotify and more! With releasing a Demo Recording, there were many factors (financially) that came into play. Hiring performers, using audio software and studio equipment isn't cheap! But, we knew to produce these demos, it would be worth it. There are also some future costs to think about as we move forward in the writing/performance process:</p>
<ul>
<li>A staged reading - the musical on its feet, the first time for an audience, open to the public.</li>
<li>New songs to be demo'd in the studio (not for public release).</li>
<li>Reaching out to producers, hopefully having a concert production produced in Nashville.</li>
<li>Fully staged production within the next 7-8 months.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any artistic venture, there will always be bumps in the road. In fact, a big bump that could potentially happen is that the theatre world isn't ready for a musical quite like this and the response ends up being mixed. We are confident that this story is universal: one of love, and acceptance. A story about siblings finding their way back to each other while, at the same time, starting to leave the nest.</p>
<ul>
<li>All funds raised will be used in the pre-production and draft phase of ""Art""</li>
<li>Your generous contributions will be used to help us reach more supporters and become advocates for families blessed with a relative with Down Syndrome.</li>

<p>“Laver son linge sale en famille en utilisant pour la lessive les cendres des aïeux.”<br/>- Jules Renard</p>
<p>After the death of her father, Natalie and her homophobic mother are forced to reunite to fulfill his wish of having his ashes scattered in Percé, Quebec. Linge Sale is a new bilingual play about intergenerational queerness, loss, and the Atlantic.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531420672/n5lpevdtyywajdrypdso.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Caitlin Cooke and Anthony Michon in Linge Sale</i></p>
<h3><strong>Director's Note</strong></h3>
<p>So often stories about young queer people are coming out stories, but Linge Sale is not a coming out story and it doesn’t end with a tearful change of heart. Avery Burrow dares to put young queer women in the driver seat and asks us to examine what we inherit.</p>
<p>Linge Sale is a love song to all the girls we couldn’t hold hands with in public, or invite to Sunday dinner for fear of the wrath of our parents.</p>
<p>This production is dedicated to our younger selves and anyone who has ever struggled with who they are in the face of their families. We see you, we love you and we hope you find the strength to be vulnerable where you can be, when you can be.</p>

</div></div>","“Laver son linge sale en famille en utilisant pour la lessive les cendres des aïeux.”- Jules Renard
After the death of her father, Natalie and her homophobic mother are forced to reunite to fulfill his wish of having his ashes scattered in Percé, Quebec. Linge Sale is a new bilingual play about intergenerational queerness, loss, and the Atlantic.

Caitlin Cooke and Anthony Michon in Linge Sale
Director's Note
So often stories about young queer people are coming out stories, but Linge Sale is not a coming out story and it doesn’t end with a tearful change of heart. Avery Burrow dares to put young queer women in the driver seat and asks us to examine what we inherit.
Linge Sale is a love song to all the girls we couldn’t hold hands with in public, or invite to Sunday dinner for fear of the wrath of our parents.
This production is dedicated to our younger selves and anyone who has ever struggled with who they are in the face of their families. We see you, we love you and we hope you find the strength to be vulnerable where you can be, when you can be.
- Murdoch

<h3>How can one write an immaterial history of a building evading from mere architectural and spatial concerns? How can the body mediate the social and urban fabric of a city? Located in the centre of Athens on Stadiou street, the imposing mansion Megaro Athinogenous that was built in the last quarter of the 19th century stands out as an example of the transitioning moment in architecture with neoclassical and French neo-baroque influences. Megaro Athinogenous had many lives, from a typical Athenian bourgeois family house, to hosting a bank, shops and a political party head quarter, the building also survived a storm, an earthquake to eventually succumbs to fire. Choreographer Ioanna Angelopoulou’s interest on this now listed building bring into focus the inhabitants of this mansion at the turn of the century. Researching the photography archive of ELIA (Greek Literary and Historical Archive), from fragments, she created an imaginary family album, an ethereal genealogy of ghosts. The mansion bore witness to the first steps of children, several generations of spectres that ran up and down the stairs, slammed doors, sat at lively family dinners debating politics,… What remains are Effigies that imprinted the photographic paper. Angelopoulou created a choreography that re-enact the creation and the apparition of an image, in a constant back and forth between their tridimensional nature that precedes the inscription and the bidimensional movements of effigies that found a dwelling in the photographs.

<p>A film about Beethoven FOR Beethoven, and for the lovers of his music worldwide. Almost every other Beethoven movie is a depressing standard biopic focusing on the saddest details of his life. This film will be a celebrations of Beethoven's music! A Musical with exciting dance numbers set to Beethoven's greatest compositions, and a Comedy showing the funny side of the man.</p>
<p>How is THIS beethoven film different?</p>

A film about Beethoven FOR Beethoven, and for the lovers of his music worldwide. Almost every other Beethoven movie is a depressing standard biopic focusing on the saddest details of his life.

<h3>Short Story</h3>
<p>In 1949 Troubled Island composed by William Grant Still became the first Grand Opera by an African American to be produced by a major company. The Opera written by Langston Hughes and Verna Arvey is set against the backdrop of the Haitian Revolution. It focuses on a crucial but often overlooked piece of history. This magnificent opera has very rarely been performed beyond its initial run and has ever been seen in full in Europe.</p>
<p>Thee Black Swan Theatre and Opera company specialises in bringing important pieces of work like this to life and will be producing a 10 night run at the Bloomsbury Theatre in Central London in 2020.  We want your help to make this the most magnificent performance it can possibly be and tell this story the way it truly deserves to be told.  We want you to help us build a legacy for this important but underappreciated piece of work so that it can become the cultural phenomenon it deserves to be.      </p>
<h3>Long Story</h3>
<p>On the 31st of March, 1949 a monumental piece of work was staged for the first time by the New York City Opera. Troubled Island composed by William Grant Still, written by Langston Hughes and Verna Arvey became the first Grand Opera composed by an African American to be produced by a major opera company. The premiere performance appeared to be a hit as it was greeted by 22 curtain calls but the critical reaction was mostly negative. Years later Judith Still, daughter of William Grant Still and Verna Arvey, said that the opera was intentionally panned by critics due to racial prejudice. Due to the influence of the critics, Troubled Island was only performed 3 times by the New York City Opera before the production was shut down. Since then there has only been one performance of the full opera, in 2013 at the Paul Robeson Theatre in Chicago and it has never been performed in full in Europe.  </p>
<p>It is a travesty that this opera is not more widely known and celebrated and Thee Black Swan Theatre and Opera company is aiming to change this. In 2013 Joe Charles the founder and artistic director of Thee Black Swan directed several workshop performances featuring extracts from Troubled Island.</p>

c'est dans le couple qu'il se réalise seulement. Je veux montrer qu'il est

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As I said above, I have been an actor ever since I can remember.  I have performed in community theaters in Riverside and Chino, California and Missoula, Montana, as well as performing at Oxnard College in California.  I have been part of the Hollywood Fringe Festival since it started in 2010 as a member of the press, and have written hundreds of reviews of shows.  <a href=""http://www.lamusiccritic.com/indie_voice_blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lamusiccritic.com/indie_voice_blog</a></p>
<p>Now it's my turn.  I have a great story to tell, and I need your help to bring it to the Hollywood Fringe Festival.  I have been so inspired attending and reviewing your stories, that I feel compelled to tell my own.</p>
<p>If you can help me, it will allow me to tell my story, as well as make me a better journalist because I will truly understand what it's like to be on the other side of the review.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div><ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
As I said above, I have been an actor ever since I can remember.  I have performed in community theaters in Riverside and Chino, California and Missoula, Montana, as well as performing at Oxnard College in California.  I have been part of the Hollywood Fringe Festival since it started in 2010 as a member of the press, and have written hundreds of reviews of shows.  http://www.lamusiccritic.com/indie_voice_blog
Now it's my turn.  I have a great story to tell, and I need your help to bring it to the Hollywood Fringe Festival.  I have been so inspired attending and reviewing your stories, that I feel compelled to tell my own.
If you can help me, it will allow me to tell my story, as well as make me a better journalist because I will truly understand what it's like to be on the other side of the review.

<p>Two years ago and after a lot of effort, we managed to create a 'Greek Theatrical Group' of Nottingham. The effort was enormous because our team is mostly formed by amateur actors. However, with the right guidance and passion for the theatre, we succeeded last year in staging Aristophanes'  play ' The Wealth' and this year ' The last Black Cat' by Eugenios Trivizas. The last performance was a bigger success, as we prepared English subtitles (to reach not only a Greek-speaking audience), but have rented a small theatre for two-night shows.</p>
<p>After a lot of discussions, our group decided that some changes have to be done, in order to expand and create even more possibilities for self- development.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest change that needs to be done is the new venue for our rehearsals. Up till now, we were meeting once a week in different venues which were not fitting the purpose. Unfortunately, we do not have enough funds to afford  to rent a proper one.</p>
<p>To be able to develop our acting skills, and prepare the new performance we are in great need of a suitable place, where we can practice.</p>
<p>Our new play is going to be staged in June, and it is very important to us.</p>
<p>It touches the delicate nature of modern Greek history after the II WW. It combines the theme of the Civil War, the big wave of immigration from Greece to Germany, the personal feeling of being torn between the two countries/cultures and much more.</p>

<p><b>Steffon Long -  Founding Artistic Director </b></p>
<p>I was a junior at the University of Massachusetts, Boston Campus, majoring in Psychology and Theatre Arts, when I saw Karen Kain and Rudolf Nureyev dance <b><i>Sleeping Beauty</i></b> with the National Ballet of Canada. I’d seen <b><i>The Nutcracker</i></b> several times as a child, but it didn’t affect me the way seeing <b>Sleeping Beauty</b> did. The day after that performance I enrolled in adult ballet classes at Boston Ballet. Three months later my teacher, Bob Steel, then a principal dancer with the company, advised me to quit school, move to NYC to study ballet full-time, and pursue a career as a professional ballet dancer. I followed his advice, and was awarded a full scholarship / Trainee position at the legendary Harkness Ballet House of Ballet Arts, (NYC) with Maria T. Vegh and the late David Howard.</p>
<p>My career as a ballet dancer was not remarkable, except for the fact that I was very fortunate to have had any kind of career at all considering how late I began dancing. I was an ordinary, well-trained, employable ballet dancer. I went on to dance corps de ballet, soloist and principal roles with San Francisco Ballet, Oakland Ballet (Oakland, CA), the National Ballet of Iran (Tehran, Iran), The Marin Ballet Company (San Rafael, CA), Classic Ballet of New Jersey, Irish National Ballet (Ireland), Ballet Classique de Paris (Paris, France) , Schindowski Ballet (Gelsenkirchen, Germany) and Stadtischen Bhunen Ballet (Dortmund, Germany).</p>
<p>Since 1985, when I retired from dancing, I have served as Dance Program Director at Stord Kulturskule and Stord Vidergaande Skule (Stord, Norway), and Artistic Director at Worcester School for the Performing Arts and Worcester Youth Ballet (Worcester, MA.), Redwood Empire Ballet School and Redwood Empire Ballet Company (Santa Rosa, CA), Yuma Ballet Theatre (Yuma, AZ), Pacifica Youth Ballet (Pacifica, CA) and Divertissement Dance Company (San Francisco, CA).</p>
<p>In addition, I have taught and choreographed for …</p>
<p>Ballet California, Maria Vegh Ballet Center, Black Hills Dance Theatre (Rapid City, South Dakota), Ballet Classico de Valencia (Valencia, Spain), Hoefgen Studios of Music and Dance (Dorsten, Germany),  Sanda Dance Company (London, UK), Classic Ballet of New Jersey, FLEX Studios, The Drill Hall, Ealing Dance Studios and Dance Works (London, UK),  Wladimir Studios  (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Stord Kulturskule and Stord Vidergaande Skule (Stord, Norway)</p>
<p>I have also been a guest teacher at ….</p>
<p>The Dance Center (Bergen, Norway), Ballet des Brandenburger Theater (Berlin, Germany), Tanztheater am Staatstheater (Cottbus, Germany),  Ballet der Stadtischen Bhunen (Hagen, Germany), The Dance Place  (Basel, Switzerland), and the Tanz Centrum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>In 1990 / 1991 I decided to further my dance education by attending Laban Centre for Movement and Dance (now it’s Trinity Laban   <a href=""http://www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/</a> ) where I studied Movement Observation and Analysis and Dance Composition.</p>
<p><b>Maria Vegh - Artistic Advisor</b></p>
<p>Maria Vegh's career has been distinguished, long and varied. Initially arriving in New York in the early 50's with a vocal scholarship to Juilliard, she was introduced to ballet and came quickly to embrace it. Beginning at the unusually late age of eighteen, she moved rapidly through her training at the National Academy of Ballet and the Ballet Russe School while studying with such notable teachers as Pamela May, Thalia Mara, Mary Skeaping and Arthur Mahoney. After dancing with the Ballet Repertory Company of New York and, as a principal dancer, with the Royal Ponciana Theatre, she began her teaching career at the National Ballet of New York. Appointed a teacher at the then widely-acclaimed, pioneering New York City <b>Harkness House for Ballet Arts</b> in 1968, she became its co-director, with David Howard, in 1971. Moving to California in 1976 (following the closing of Harkness) to become Artistic Director of <b>Marin Ballet</b>, Ms. Vegh led that institution for more than a decade during its rapid accent to national prominence (detailed in a 1981 Dance Magazine feature article).</p>
<p>In 1993, she left Marin Ballet in order to establish the <b>Maria Vegh Ballet Centre</b>. Not a school in the usual sense (it offered virtually no classes), it provided the setting within which Ms. Vegh essentially worked with a small group of serious, promising intermediate and advanced ballet students who aspired to professional careers: individualized instruction and coaching, the identification and correction of technical issues, the development of strong, precise technique and musicality, and injury prevention.</p>
<p>Ms. Vegh has travelled widely across the U.S. and Peru and Japan as a <b>master teacher</b> and as a leader of <b>teacher-training programs</b>, in which she utilized her own syllabus, <i>To Dance</i>. She has been a guest-teacher at many universities and colleges, and ballet schools and companies; she is a member of Regional Dance America's Advisory Committee; she has recently produced a series of videotapes on the training of ballet students.</p>
<p><b>Devon Chen - Associate Director</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Devon started developing her passion for dance at an early age with her first ballet classes. From there, she went on to study many different dance forms including modern, jazz and hip-hop and fell more in love with all that dance had to offer. She has performed with LV Dance Collective, Loose Change Dance Company, Jenni Bregman and Dancers, Vassar College Repertory Dance Theatre and FlyPeople - of which she was a Co-Founding member of the only student-run dance company at Vassar College. Furthermore, Devon has performed at the International Summer Dance Festival in Burgos, Spain, the San Francisco International Hip Hop Fest, City Dance Live on Stage, HeArt of Market, Bay Area National Dance Week and SAFEhouse Arts' Summer Performance Festival. </p>Additionally, Devon received a B. A. in Biopsychology from Vassar College and went on to earn her Master’s and Doctorate in Physical Therapy from the University of California, San Francisco and San Francisco State University. She is also a certified Pilates Instructor and uses Pilates to assist in the rehabilitation of her patients. Currently, she practices physical therapy at the Center for Sports and Dance Medicine at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, where she is a dance medicine specialist, as well as backstage for the casts and crew of touring Broadway shows such as the Book of Mormon and Porgy and Bess.<p></p>

I went on to dance corps de ballet, soloist and principal roles with San Francisco Ballet, Oakland Ballet (Oakland, CA), the National Ballet of Iran (Tehran, Iran), The Marin Ballet Company (San Rafael, CA), Classic Ballet of New Jersey, Irish National Ballet (Ireland), Ballet Classique de Paris (Paris, France) , Schindowski Ballet (Gelsenkirchen, Germany) and Stadtischen Bhunen Ballet (Dortmund, Germany).
Since 1985, when I retired from dancing, I have served as Dance Program Director at Stord Kulturskule and Stord Vidergaande Skule (Stord, Norway), and Artistic Director at Worcester School for the Performing Arts and Worcester Youth Ballet (Worcester, MA.), Redwood Empire Ballet School and Redwood Empire Ballet Company (Santa Rosa, CA), Yuma Ballet Theatre (Yuma, AZ), Pacifica Youth Ballet (Pacifica, CA) and Divertissement Dance Company (San Francisco, CA).
In addition, I have taught and choreographed for …
Ballet California, Maria Vegh Ballet Center, Black Hills Dance Theatre (Rapid City, South Dakota), Ballet Classico de Valencia (Valencia, Spain), Hoefgen Studios of Music and Dance (Dorsten, Germany),  Sanda Dance Company (London, UK), Classic Ballet of New Jersey, FLEX Studios, The Drill Hall, Ealing Dance Studios and Dance Works (London, UK),  Wladimir Studios  (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and Stord Kulturskule and Stord Vidergaande Skule (Stord, Norway)
I have also been a guest teacher at ….
The Dance Center (Bergen, Norway), Ballet des Brandenburger Theater (Berlin, Germany), Tanztheater am Staatstheater (Cottbus, Germany),  Ballet der Stadtischen Bhunen (Hagen, Germany), The Dance Place  (Basel, Switzerland), and the Tanz Centrum in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
In 1990 / 1991 I decided to further my dance education by attending Laban Centre for Movement and Dance (now it’s Trinity Laban   www.trinitylaban.ac.uk/ ) where I studied Movement Observation and Analysis and Dance Composition.
Maria Vegh - Artistic Advisor
Maria Vegh's career has been distinguished, long and varied. Initially arriving in New York in the early 50's with a vocal scholarship to Juilliard, she was introduced to ballet and came quickly to embrace it. Beginning at the unusually late age of eighteen, she moved rapidly through her training at the National Academy of Ballet and the Ballet Russe School while studying with such notable teachers as Pamela May, Thalia Mara, Mary Skeaping and Arthur Mahoney. After dancing with the Ballet Repertory Company of New York and, as a principal dancer, with the Royal Ponciana Theatre, she began her teaching career at the National Ballet of New York. Appointed a teacher at the then widely-acclaimed, pioneering New York City Harkness House for Ballet Arts in 1968, she became its co-director, with David Howard, in 1971. Moving to California in 1976 (following the closing of Harkness) to become Artistic Director of Marin Ballet, Ms. Vegh led that institution for more than a decade during its rapid accent to national prominence (detailed in a 1981 Dance Magazine feature article).
In 1993, she left Marin Ballet in order to establish the Maria Vegh Ballet Centre. Not a school in the usual sense (it offered virtually no classes), it provided the setting within which Ms. Vegh essentially worked with a small group of serious, promising intermediate and advanced ballet students who aspired to professional careers: individualized instruction and coaching, the identification and correction of technical issues, the development of strong, precise technique and musicality, and injury prevention.
Ms. Vegh has travelled widely across the U.S. and Peru and Japan as a master teacher and as a leader of teacher-training programs, in which she utilized her own syllabus, To Dance. She has been a guest-teacher at many universities and colleges, and ballet schools and companies; she is a member of Regional Dance America's Advisory Committee; she has recently produced a series of videotapes on the training of ballet students.
Devon Chen - Associate Director

Devon started developing her passion for dance at an early age with her first ballet classes. From there, she went on to study many different dance forms including modern, jazz and hip-hop and fell more in love with all that dance had to offer. She has performed with LV Dance Collective, Loose Change Dance Company, Jenni Bregman and Dancers, Vassar College Repertory Dance Theatre and FlyPeople - of which she was a Co-Founding member of the only student-run dance company at Vassar College. Furthermore, Devon has performed at the International Summer Dance Festival in Burgos, Spain, the San Francisco International Hip Hop Fest, City Dance Live on Stage, HeArt of Market, Bay Area National Dance Week and SAFEhouse Arts' Summer Performance Festival. Additionally, Devon received a B. A. in Biopsychology from Vassar College and went on to earn her Master’s and Doctorate in Physical Therapy from the University of California, San Francisco and San Francisco State University. She is also a certified Pilates Instructor and uses Pilates to assist in the rehabilitation of her patients. Currently, she practices physical therapy at the Center for Sports and Dance Medicine at Saint Francis Memorial Hospital in San Francisco, where she is a dance medicine specialist, as well as backstage for the casts and crew of touring Broadway shows such as the Book of Mormon and Porgy and Bess.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>LE JUICE is funding for its summer tour of our inaugural show, S/he/it Happens. So far we're performing in London, Birmingham and Manchester, with plans to spread our wings in September.   </p>
<p>S/he/it Happens is a one-woman gender-messing clown show exploring the violence of assimilation through slapstick, wit, and some surprising new friends. A curious clown is stuck between the gender binary. Armed with not much more than a pair of boxers, they set out on a violently hilarious attempt to fit, one way or another. Is it really rewriting the rules if you haven't read the rulebook?</p>
<p>We make clowning with bite; politically charged, yet highly personal comedy. We believe in self-love and self-mockery, and want you to come join in. As a brand new, graduate company, we need your help in finding our feet and developing our work for a larger audience. Our plan this summer is to test new material on new audiences, touring smaller fringes as the next step to larger plans. However, we cannot do this on our own; as such a tiny company, micro funding is hard to come by, and as two students, we lack the start up capital.  </p>
<h3>Who we are​</h3>
<p>Le Juice serves a fresh box of concentrated clowning comedy, sucking up the hard stuff. Artist - Miranda Porter. Producer - Livi Dunlop.</p>
<div><p>Livi and Miranda met each other in the distant days of 6th form college, down in the depths of Hampshire. </p></div>
<div>Miranda is a soon-to-be graduate of European Theatre Arts at Rose Bruford College. She has studied clowning under Gaulier in France, as well as in Spain, Poland, and Finland. This is her first solo project. Full bio and CV - <a href=""http://www.mirandaporter.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mirandaporter.co.uk</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Livi Dunlop is a theatremaker based in Winchester and Oxford. Their work can be found at lividunlop.com.</p>
<p>Graphics by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/a_mbee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amber Beardow</a>.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We feel it is crucial to pay any collaborators for their work - your money will cover our artist's fees for graphics, as well as all our print marketing costs. Additionally, it will cover the company's transport to and from Manchester, all props and costumes, music licensing, insurance, and our festival registration fees, all of which add up, as well as covering our venue hire fees for one city.

</div></div>","Short Summary
LE JUICE is funding for its summer tour of our inaugural show, S/he/it Happens. So far we're performing in London, Birmingham and Manchester, with plans to spread our wings in September.   
S/he/it Happens is a one-woman gender-messing clown show exploring the violence of assimilation through slapstick, wit, and some surprising new friends. A curious clown is stuck between the gender binary. Armed with not much more than a pair of boxers, they set out on a violently hilarious attempt to fit, one way or another. Is it really rewriting the rules if you haven't read the rulebook?
We make clowning with bite; politically charged, yet highly personal comedy. We believe in self-love and self-mockery, and want you to come join in. As a brand new, graduate company, we need your help in finding our feet and developing our work for a larger audience. Our plan this summer is to test new material on new audiences, touring smaller fringes as the next step to larger plans. However, we cannot do this on our own; as such a tiny company, micro funding is hard to come by, and as two students, we lack the start up capital.  
Who we are​
Le Juice serves a fresh box of concentrated clowning comedy, sucking up the hard stuff. Artist - Miranda Porter. Producer - Livi Dunlop.
Livi and Miranda met each other in the distant days of 6th form college, down in the depths of Hampshire. 
Miranda is a soon-to-be graduate of European Theatre Arts at Rose Bruford College. She has studied clowning under Gaulier in France, as well as in Spain, Poland, and Finland. This is her first solo project. Full bio and CV - http://www.mirandaporter.co.uk

 
Livi Dunlop is a theatremaker based in Winchester and Oxford. Their work can be found at lividunlop.com.
Graphics by Amber Beardow.
What We Need & What You Get
We feel it is crucial to pay any collaborators for their work - your money will cover our artist's fees for graphics, as well as all our print marketing costs. Additionally, it will cover the company's transport to and from Manchester, all props and costumes, music licensing, insurance, and our festival registration fees, all of which add up, as well as covering our venue hire fees for one city. Any extra we raise above our target will go towards paying for September venues - we've applied to Oxford's Old Fire Station (a wonderful venue which you should check out regardless), which costs three times our Manchester venue per night. We are also including 10% to cover Indiegogo's fees and handling charges.
In return we've set up some fun rewards in the spirit of the occasion, and we are always willing to chat, chuckle, and share our enthusiasm. Plus, y'know, you could always come see the show..

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A Hitchcock/Tarantino-esque comedy with guns, lovers and a Broadway starlet.</p>
<p>It’s not the best birthday for Broadway star Blaze O’Hara. She is the unwitting hypotenuse of a love triangle with her boyfriend, aspiring writer Jimmy Poole and her landlord, Mafia Don Harry Verona. She can keep Harry’s heart and hands at bay until the gun goes off and Harry is shot. With his mother due any minute to meet her, Blaze needs quick thinking and even quicker action.</p>
<p>Being a milestone birthday, Blaze begins to evaluate her life, love and career. Mortal danger will do that to a girl. She quickly realises that men have been forcing their desires and decisions on her for too long and it’s time to take back control. Not just to save her life, but to face her fears, literally, because The Trouble With Harry is that he’s hanging from a Rope by the Rear Window; and his mother’s due any minute for coffee.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the West End we need a full blown set - bathroom and living room and a van to get everything to and from the theatre in one day/night.</p>
<p>We need £4,000.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While tickets are available to the public, it is an industry showcase for producers who may wish to take the show on for a proper West End and/or Broadway run. We are trying to build sustainable careers for extraordinary actors and this is the second step towards that promise. </p>
<p>The best chance we have of showcasing their talent is for a first rate West End production on the night. We have the same cast as Edinburgh except for the role of Blaze which is now being played by the supremely talented Rachael Sparkes. </p>
<p>We also need your laughter so, if you can come, please do and please laugh uproariously - <a href=""https://lwtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/the-man-from-verona/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://lwtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/the-man-from-...</a> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The show will go on. There is no risk to your investment.</p>
<p>The only challenge is that we don't sell out, don't get the laughs and don't showcase ourselves in the best light.</p>

<h3>Hi! My name is Meg. I'm an artist, drag queen, drag mother, and overall lover of everything glamorous. </h3>
<p>A year ago, I created a show called It's Not Personal, It's Drag as my senior project to close out my theatre degree. The show was a hit, taught tons of people about drag and the gay community, and left everyone feeling fierce. This year, I'm bringing the show back, and better than ever! The only thing is...we need your help. Before, the tech aspects were available to me, but this time, all of it is coming out of my pocket. Any help you can give, even if it's just $1, will mean the world to us and make an impact on the success of the show. My goals for this year?</p>
<p>- Reach out and market to audiences beyond the immediate gay community</p>
<p>- Teach audiences about drag and constructs of gender </p>
<p>- Inspire audience members to go out and see more local drag</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>With the registration fee, light rental, sound rental, materials to transform the space we're in, posters/marketing materials and decorations, the costs come to roughly $750. As an individual paying for it solo, I could really use some help so I really can get all of the materials I need and make these queens look and sound stellar. </li>
<li>If you donate $5, you'll get your very own signed poster from all of the queens! </li>
<li>If you donate $10, you'll get a reserved seat in our front row VIP section, a signed poster, and a free Mocktail. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Meg. I'm an artist, drag queen, drag mother, and overall lover of everything glamorous. 
A year ago, I created a show called It's Not Personal, It's Drag as my senior project to close out my theatre degree. The show was a hit, taught tons of people about drag and the gay community, and left everyone feeling fierce. This year, I'm bringing the show back, and better than ever! The only thing is...we need your help. Before, the tech aspects were available to me, but this time, all of it is coming out of my pocket. Any help you can give, even if it's just $1, will mean the world to us and make an impact on the success of the show. My goals for this year?
- Reach out and market to audiences beyond the immediate gay community
- Teach audiences about drag and constructs of gender 
- Inspire audience members to go out and see more local drag

What We Need & What You Get

With the registration fee, light rental, sound rental, materials to transform the space we're in, posters/marketing materials and decorations, the costs come to roughly $750. As an individual paying for it solo, I could really use some help so I really can get all of the materials I need and make these queens look and sound stellar. 
If you donate $5, you'll get your very own signed poster from all of the queens! 
If you donate $10, you'll get a reserved seat in our front row VIP section, a signed poster, and a free Mocktail. 


The Impact
Drag is beautiful, drag is grungy, drag is campy, drag is controversial, but most importantly- drag is powerful. I want to bring that power to the Jersey Fringe, because this world needs drag. It’s Not Personal, It’s Drag will deliver you all of the charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent that you need for the rest of the year. The goal is to “wear crowns, fuck with gender, bend the rules, don’t surrender” (in the words of Sasha Velour, season nine winner of Rupaul’s Drag Race) and ultimately entice audiences to get out to see and support local drag, because the art form supports us all.

<p>La <b>Fundación Cultural Metáforas</b> es una Entidad sin ánimo de lucro de
Bogotá D.C. - Colombia que desarrolla proyectos culturales, de educación
informal, desarrollo del talento humano y de favorecimiento a comunidades en
situación de vulnerabilidad a través de puestas en escena teatrales,
Bibliovacaciones creativas y programas de senbilización artística. </p>
<p>The Metaphors Cultural Foundation is a
non-profit organization in Bogota D.C Colombia. It develops cultural projects
concerning informal education, talent development, and provides support for
communities in vulnerable situation through theater plays, creative
library-vacations and art programs.</p>
<p><b>NUESTRA PRECOCUPACIÓN / OUR CONCERN</b></p>
<p>En Colombia resulta muy difícil
producir espectáculos teatrales auto gestionables y auto sostenibles por
diferentes motivos: los artistas no podemos depender económicamente de nuestro
arte, hay una subvaloración al oficio del teatro y del actor,  existe una sobre demanda de actores y de
montajes teatrales para una escasa oferta que paga precios irrisorios por las
funciones y por los honorarios de los artistas, no existen modelos gubernamentales
que garanticen la formalización y del desarrollo sostenible de dicha actividad,
por todo esto,  en la gran mayoría de los
casos nos toca  a los actores, directores
y gestores culturales alternar las actividades artísticas con la docencia, los
eventos recreativos, labores freelance, prácticas de teatro de calle y en el peor
de los casos desempeñar oficios muy alejados de nuestra profesión (ventas,
servicio al cliente, atención al público etc.) para poder vivir y solventar los
gastos diarios de alimentación, vestuario y vivienda entre otros; situación que
no ha facilitado que la Fundación Cultural Metáforas pueda consolidar equipos
de trabajo estables para llevar a cabo su objeto social.</p>
<p>Por otra parte, nos enfrentamos a
la disyuntiva de encontrar financiamiento para la producción de las obras, lo
que nos imposibilita llevar a cabo un proceso de creación sólido y coherente,
situación que en muchos casos termina desmotivando a los artistas y
fragmentando los procesos de creación.</p>
<p>En este marco contextual se
presenta esta campaña de crowdfunding como una alternativa para hallar
soluciones a nuestra problemática.</p>
<p>In Colombia it is very difficult to stage
theatrical performances which would be self-managed and self-sustaining. And
there is a number of reasons for this:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Financially
the artists can't depend on their occupation due to low salaries , </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The
art of the theater and of the actor is underestimated </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>There
is an over demand of actors and plays for the lack of offers with ridiculously
low prices for a show and low actors’ fees </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>There
are no models of government, which guarantee formal and sustainable development
of this activity.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, in most cases it is up
to actors, directors and cultural managers to combine the artistic activity
with teaching, recreational events, freelancing, taking part in street theatre
and in the worst case, to have occupation which is quite far from our
profession (sales, customer service, etc.) to be able to survive and afford
daily expenses for food, clothes and dwelling in the society. This is a kind of
situation which has not facilitated that the Cultural Foundation “Metáforas”
could consolidate stable teams to carry out its corporative aim. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we face the dilemma of
finding funding for the production of the works which disables us to carry out
a firm and coherent process of creating. In many cases this situation ends up
with demotivating artists and fragmenting a creation processes.</p>
<p>In this context crowdfunding is presented as an
alternative campaign to find solutions to our issues.</p>
<p><b>DESCRIPCIÓN DE CAMPAÑA / DESCRIPTION OF THE CAMPAIGN</b></p>

La Fundación Cultural Metáforas es una Entidad sin ánimo de lucro de
Bogotá D.C. - Colombia que desarrolla proyectos culturales, de educación
informal, desarrollo del talento humano y de favorecimiento a comunidades en
situación de vulnerabilidad a través de puestas en escena teatrales,
Bibliovacaciones creativas y programas de senbilización artística. 
The Metaphors Cultural Foundation is a
non-profit organization in Bogota D.C Colombia. It develops cultural projects
concerning informal education, talent development, and provides support for
communities in vulnerable situation through theater plays, creative
library-vacations and art programs.
NUESTRA PRECOCUPACIÓN / OUR CONCERN
En Colombia resulta muy difícil
producir espectáculos teatrales auto gestionables y auto sostenibles por
diferentes motivos: los artistas no podemos depender económicamente de nuestro
arte, hay una subvaloración al oficio del teatro y del actor,  existe una sobre demanda de actores y de
montajes teatrales para una escasa oferta que paga precios irrisorios por las
funciones y por los honorarios de los artistas, no existen modelos gubernamentales
que garanticen la formalización y del desarrollo sostenible de dicha actividad,
por todo esto,  en la gran mayoría de los
casos nos toca  a los actores, directores
y gestores culturales alternar las actividades artísticas con la docencia, los
eventos recreativos, labores freelance, prácticas de teatro de calle y en el peor
de los casos desempeñar oficios muy alejados de nuestra profesión (ventas,
servicio al cliente, atención al público etc.) para poder vivir y solventar los
gastos diarios de alimentación, vestuario y vivienda entre otros; situación que
no ha facilitado que la Fundación Cultural Metáforas pueda consolidar equipos
de trabajo estables para llevar a cabo su objeto social.
Por otra parte, nos enfrentamos a
la disyuntiva de encontrar financiamiento para la producción de las obras, lo
que nos imposibilita llevar a cabo un proceso de creación sólido y coherente,
situación que en muchos casos termina desmotivando a los artistas y
fragmentando los procesos de creación.
En este marco contextual se
presenta esta campaña de crowdfunding como una alternativa para hallar
soluciones a nuestra problemática.
In Colombia it is very difficult to stage
theatrical performances which would be self-managed and self-sustaining. And
there is a number of reasons for this:
· 
Financially
the artists can't depend on their occupation due to low salaries , 
· 
The
art of the theater and of the actor is underestimated 
· 
There
is an over demand of actors and plays for the lack of offers with ridiculously
low prices for a show and low actors’ fees 
· 
There
are no models of government, which guarantee formal and sustainable development
of this activity.
For all these reasons, in most cases it is up
to actors, directors and cultural managers to combine the artistic activity
with teaching, recreational events, freelancing, taking part in street theatre
and in the worst case, to have occupation which is quite far from our
profession (sales, customer service, etc.) to be able to survive and afford
daily expenses for food, clothes and dwelling in the society. This is a kind of
situation which has not facilitated that the Cultural Foundation “Metáforas”
could consolidate stable teams to carry out its corporative aim. 
On the other hand, we face the dilemma of
finding funding for the production of the works which disables us to carry out
a firm and coherent process of creating. In many cases this situation ends up
with demotivating artists and fragmenting a creation processes.
In this context crowdfunding is presented as an
alternative campaign to find solutions to our issues.

<p>Heavy Metal Knitting World Championships were held in Joensuu, Finland for the first time in July 2019. News of the event swept to all corners of the world - in one week videos made of the event had been seen by hundreds of millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>Spend one minute of your life by viewing this video from the event. You won't regret it. Or if you don't like anything creative and crazy then you will. Then you shouldn't be even reading this campaign.</p>

</div>
<p>The competition was a success, but unfortunately it was organized by a group of heavy metal knitting enthusiast-volunteers and an EU funded program that saw its end in 2020. No more EU monies meant no more Heavy Metal Knitting - unless someone took a risk and did something.</p>
<p><strong>So we did!</strong></p>
<p>We established a company called WTF Productions Ltd. (yeah, you read that right - it's Welcome to Finland Productions), who would take the responsibility of organizing craziest Finnish summer event out there. </p>
<p>We prepared everything in time and in late December 2019 we launched the application period for the 2020 competition and started eagerly waiting for the applications to roll in.<br/><br/><strong>But little did we know,</strong> that there would be a person in China, who would eat a bat and who single-handedly would make the world go bat shit crazy. And cause home quarantines, restrictions on movement and halts on commercial activities on a scale never seen before...</p>
<p>Our team pondered on this just when the application period was about to close in March and made the heavy decision - <i>we had to cancel the 2020 event.</i></p>
<p>In 2019, the live event had people coming from Japan, UK, USA, Israel, Russia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. If we were to organize the event during the summer 2020, we would pose a serious threat to the contestants if they were to fly to Finland during the Covid-19 epidemic and meet with people from all around the world.</p>
<p>We can't estimate (and we believe no one can) when the crisis and limitations will be over, so the safest bet to do here is to cancel the whole year 2020 and look forward to 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The main problem in cancelling events </strong>is however, that a cancelled event cannot generate any income for the organizer. No income - no stage, no lights, no security, no band, no event and eventually no organizers.</p>
<p>To make ends meet and to actually make the event happen again in 2021, we're asking help from you - the grand people of the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Help us create the event again and make it even better!</strong></p>
<p>By supporting this project, you will make sure that Heavy Metal Knitting will continue and see the crowning of the Heavy Metal Knitting World Champion 2021 (and beyond).</p>

</div><div>
<p>Organizing a Heavy Metal Knitting World Championship event entails on a minimum level</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue &amp; stage (it's an open air event, so we need to rent and build a stage)</li>
<li>Audio equipment for the metal band (heavy metal knitting ain't the same in acoustic mode)</li>
<li>Heavy metal band (this goes without saying. Without a metal band, heavy metal knitting is just - well - knitting)</li>
<li>Sound engineer (to mix those tunes for the people seeing the event live)</li>
<li>Licenses (if we play real metal songs from real bands we need to pay for the licenses)</li>
<li>Security (we don't know how out of hand the event will get, better get some people securing the artists)</li>
<li>Live feed (we do realize that not all people can (or want) to come to the most remote corner of the European Union, so the thing we should do is to bring the action to you when it's happening!)</li>
<li>The evening before - the contestants need to get to know each other and relax a bit before their big show. We're planning to host a small get-together for the contestants in a Finnish forest under the midnight sun. </li>
</ul>
<p>The event and the list above will cost us approximately 20,666 €. Note that we didn't include any compensation for the team in the estimation. We really want to make this happen so we set the bar on the minimum level and hope we're able to exceed it with our idea. If we get more, we're super happy about it and can make even better of an event! </p>
<ul></ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of 20,666 €, we'll try to make the event happen anyway. Cutting corners is not nice nor wanted, but the most important thing is that we guarantee that the event will actually take place. If the campaign falls short of the goal - we'll just have to find another way to fund it.</p>

<p><strong>In exchange for your interest and monies we offer something truly great (in our opinion at least).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any perk will grant you a lifetime access to the most exquisite club of all time: The Heavy Metal Knitters of the World (we actually have a Facebook group under that name). That and your name permanently on the Wall of Heavy Metal Knitting Fame that will be on our website <a href=""http://www.heavymetalknitting.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.heavymetalknitting.com</a>. Just how cool is that? YOUR NAME ON THE HEAVY METAL KNITTING WEBSITE!</li>
<li>You can purchase the coolest clothes and carry the heavy metal knitting logos on your t-shirt or patch your badge anywhere you like. Be a promoter. Pleeeaaase.</li>
<li>You can learn how to do heavy metal knitting yourself! Buy the heavy metal knitting starter pack and play some Purl Jam or SlipKnit. The starter kit contains actual knitting needles, Finnish wool made from real sheep, music recommendations, and of course instructions and a moves list on how to do heavy metal knitting!</li>
<li>We'll make a few heavy metal knitting wool sweaters and place them available for purchase only in IndieGoGo! Go get em while they're there! Really unique. These will be knitted while listening to your favourite metal band on repeat.</li>
<li>The entrepreneurs and business people will see our limited heavy metal knitting cooperation packages worth of buying. Remember the millions of video views we got? Wouldn't it be great to see your company there too?</li>
<li>We also made a limited perk for Elon Musk. Elon alone can make Heavy Metal Knitting happen. At the cost of 20,666€ Elon alone can buy the ""This is for you Elon"" cooperation package. If Elon buys this perk, we would name the event for 2021 as ""Elon Musk Heavy Metal Knitting World Championship"" Elon Musk is a great inspiration to all of us at the WTF Productions company, so this would be the greatest thing to happen :D</li>

<p>The impact of the campaign is immense. The Internet (especially the Internet of Japan) demands more stuff like this. If the campaign is successful, we're able to safely continue developing the event and start planning it for the years to come (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024...)</p>
<p>Last year our small team built the event from scratch and on a very low budget still resulting in awesome material. Just think what is possible if there's support from all the corners of the world!</p>
<p>We're aiming to build a worldwide community of heavy metal knitters with the Heavy Metal World Championship being it's yearly peak event. This campaign is a make or break in this endeavor.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The biggest risk one can think of has already realized. The Covid-19 epidemic shut down entire continents and made going to other countries and organizing events impossible. We cannot be certain that the epidemic and governments around the world would allow the participants to arrive to Finland in July 2019, so we did what we could and moved the event forward by one full year.</p>
<p>Other, not so dire risks relate to funding and marketing.</p>
<p>The funding part is obvious - to organize the event, we need to put in hundreds of hours of work and pay the professionals who make the show happen in July 2021. We should be able to attract funding worth of 20 666 € from different channels, but if we don't we'll still try to make the event happen.</p>
<p>We prioritize on securing the funding for the event before anything else.</p>
<p>The second risk is that we won't get enough participants in the competition. Last year there was 26 applicants our of which 12 got into the live finals. We're obviously expecting more applicants for the 2021 event as the Covid-19 epidemic should be a thing in the past.</p>

<p><b>OR,--</b>by 
Liz Duffy Adams.  Aphra Behn, the
first female playwright of the English Restoration stage (and a spy!), meets up
with The Merry Monarch King Charles and Nell Gwynne, the first female actress
on the English stage…and hot fireworks follow! 
Originally produced by SF’s Magic Theatre.</p>
<p><b>The Merchant of Venice—by
you-know-who.</b>  Italians and Jews speak
in accent which lends rhythm to the language, in this controversial and brutal
“comedy” about a harsh collecting of a debt and revenge.  But teenage Portia is the smartest girl in
Venice who outwits them all (think a young Katharine Hepburn).  The old question remains: “Who is the hero
and who the villain?”<i>In two hours</i>
with all the boring parts tossed into the bin of dramatic history, and
accompanied by lovely traditional Italian music.  </p>
<p><b>The Actor’s
Nightmare &amp; Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All to You—</b>by Christopher Durang.  The bad dream of every actor of showing up
in underwear not knowing their lines.  Worse
in the cast are historical theatre luminaries Henry Irving, Sarah Siddons, Dame
Ellen Terry.  Worse yet, the plays are <i>Hamlet, Private Lives, A Man for All
Seasons, </i>and a ersatz Samuel Beckett Play. 
The other one is the nun who terrorized every parochial schoolboy’s
dreams and made the rest of us laugh hysterically at her educational
philosophy. </p>
<p><b>DOG’S HAMLET and CAHOOT’S MACBETH</b> by Tom Stoppard.  This clever romp is two short plays. In the
first, a troupe of English schoolboys (played by adults) speak in a mock
language called ""Dogg."" This hilarious language babbles along until
the schoolboys, who are studying Shakespeare's ""foreign"" language,
present an incredibly funny 15 minute version of Hamlet and then encore with a
two-minute version!   <i>Then</i>, after the Prague Spring of 1968, theaters were shuttered and state-supported actors lost their jobs.  But you could ""rent"" an evening of theatre by having 5 actors show up at your door with a suitcase full of props and costumes and put on a play in your living room.  In ""Kahoot's Macbeth"" the action shifts between the bare stage and a police inquiry. The murder and intrigue of Shakespeare's play are juxtaposed with the Czech political harassment.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">""The language and the laughter are contagious...Lewis

John Hale and Karly Shea in ""Other People's Money""  Mar-Apr 2014 at Kehillah""WHY RAISE MONEY FOR JUST ONE PLAY?""...our rationaleFor for all the local enthusiasm, great reviews, and advertising—we haven't been in the same place long enough  to make a splash and bring in the audiences.          For instance: ""What I Did Last Summer"" (Nov 1 - Dec 13) costs $13,000 to produce...and we grossed only $3, 000 in 17 performances.We plan on doing three plays this year.  But it is unrealistic to expect to raise enough for all three (about $40K plus) in 40 days, so
we are aiming to raise enough for another production while we rally more
support and get more audience.                              So, ""One play at a time.""""The Dining Room"" with John Hale, Karly Shea, Aaron Vanderbeeck, Susannah Wood, Brett Mermer, Jamie Harkin  Nov-Dec 2013 Piedmont Center for the Arts
""ARE WE WORTH IT?""...quotes from reviews 
We have produced 3 plays “The Dining
Room,” “Other People’s Money,” and “What I Did Last Summer,” and 3 staged
readings “The Vibrator Play,” “Love Letters,” and “Speed-the Plow.” Our plays have received first-class
reviews.  Here are the blurbs:
""When
I saw their riotous and high-spirited production of ""The Dining Room""
by A.R.Gurney last holiday season, I thought here is a neighborhood theatre
company whose work I do not want to miss. “The Piedmont-Oakland Rep is
thoroughly professional.--Jeremy Larner,
Screenwriter, Academy Award winner for Original Screenplay in 1973
for ""The Candidate"" which starred Robert Redford.
 “[The Dining Room] is more than a baby step –
it’s a full-fledged accomplishment. Deft orchestrator, the Rep’s artistic
director, John McMullen, who has chosen perhaps the perfect play for his
company’s debut in town.”--Robert C. Hall, Piedmont Post
“Other People's Money is… an enormously entertaining ride—a not-so-fictional history lesson that rockets
viewers right into the present. Piedmont Oakland Rep has done a great job bringing it to life.”---Barry Willis, president,
Critics Circle in Piedmont Post
 “Come for the greed and sex, stay for the
doughnuts.  [reviewing""Other People's Money""] …exquisite
power plays and the compelling-yet-repelling 
(John Hale as) Garfield, whose cunning, self-deprecation, dancey
rejoinders, and fetish for doughnuts make him…highly watchable.”–Anna Pulley , East Bay Express

.. the distraught mother is a joy to watch…. [Director John] McMullen
keeps the action moving at a good clip….Add two teen pals and a bit of
sexual tension…[in 'What I Did Last Summer'], you have a coming-of-age
drama  with plenty of grit.” – Sally Hogarty, Contra Costa Times &
Inside Bay Area News
“Other People's Money is…a
neat ensemble for the often quick scenes with sharp dialogue.  It's a fine Fall entertainment—and hopefully
PORT has a long run of its own on Piedmont Avenue.” --Ken Bullock, Berkeley Daily Planet




Nathan Zambala, Rosie Fry, Cameron Dodd in ""What I Did Last Summer""            Nov-Dec 2014 at 4137 Piedmont Avenue--where we want to stay!

""WHERE THE MONEY GOES""...our budget for full disclosure--and which part you might want to underwrite.We pay the actors--not much, but we
pay. Many non-Equity theatres don’t pay.  Actors have to pay for transportation, a quick
snack on the way to rehearsal.            Each actor puts in about 200 hours per play: 15 performances of 3 hours each.  25 rehearsals—5 nights per week from 7 pm to 10 pm--usually
after a full day’s work at an office or a restaurant. At least 40 hours to memorize lines.  Talk about dedication!
We spend little on the set--it's theatre of the imagination!--and we borrow most
of the costumes. Royalties are $100 PER PERFORMANCE…unless we do Shakespeare,
Shaw, or Wilde, etc.…but we mostly want to bring you those plays that perhaps you don’t
see elsewhere.

Boston
Marriage—David Mamet’s only love story, a high comedy about a pair of
Lesbian Courtesans Con-Artists in Victorian Times.
Medea--Euripides, adaptation by California poet Robinson Jeffers...                   “HELL HATH NO FURY….She gave him her all.   Stole
the treasure, betrayed her father, cut her brother into pieces then threw the
pieces out the back of the chariot to slow down her father’s pursuit.  She came with him to his homeland where they
treated this princess like an outsider, an alien, a witch. …not that she didn’t
have her tricks and potions. Now he is leaving her to marry a younger woman—the
king’s daughter—so he can climb the ladder of success. And he plans to take
their two boys with him. BUT…Some women you just shouldn’t mess with.”                         Judith Anderson urged her friend Jeffers to adapt the play for her--and she won the Tony for her performance!  ""...a very actable version."" 
OR,--by 
Liz Duffy Adams.  Aphra Behn, the
first female playwright of the English Restoration stage (and a spy!), meets up
with The Merry Monarch King Charles and Nell Gwynne, the first female actress
on the English stage…and hot fireworks follow! 
Originally produced by SF’s Magic Theatre.
The Merchant of Venice—by
you-know-who.  Italians and Jews speak
in accent which lends rhythm to the language, in this controversial and brutal
“comedy” about a harsh collecting of a debt and revenge.  But teenage Portia is the smartest girl in
Venice who outwits them all (think a young Katharine Hepburn).  The old question remains: “Who is the hero
and who the villain?”In two hours
with all the boring parts tossed into the bin of dramatic history, and
accompanied by lovely traditional Italian music.  
The Actor’s
Nightmare & Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All to You—by Christopher Durang.  The bad dream of every actor of showing up
in underwear not knowing their lines.  Worse
in the cast are historical theatre luminaries Henry Irving, Sarah Siddons, Dame
Ellen Terry.  Worse yet, the plays are Hamlet, Private Lives, A Man for All
Seasons, and a ersatz Samuel Beckett Play. 
The other one is the nun who terrorized every parochial schoolboy’s
dreams and made the rest of us laugh hysterically at her educational
philosophy. 
DOG’S HAMLET and CAHOOT’S MACBETH by Tom Stoppard.  This clever romp is two short plays. In the
first, a troupe of English schoolboys (played by adults) speak in a mock
language called ""Dogg."" This hilarious language babbles along until
the schoolboys, who are studying Shakespeare's ""foreign"" language,
present an incredibly funny 15 minute version of Hamlet and then encore with a
two-minute version!   Then, after the Prague Spring of 1968, theaters were shuttered and state-supported actors lost their jobs.  But you could ""rent"" an evening of theatre by having 5 actors show up at your door with a suitcase full of props and costumes and put on a play in your living room.  In ""Kahoot's Macbeth"" the action shifts between the bare stage and a police inquiry. The murder and intrigue of Shakespeare's play are juxtaposed with the Czech political harassment.  ""The language and the laughter are contagious...Lewis
Carroll would have been at home."" - The New York Time. ""A blend of comic nonsense and astringent political
satire."" - Christian Science Monitor



Heidi Wolff and Brett Mermer ""In the Next Room: The Vibrator Play""  Sept 2014  at 4137 Piedmont Avenue
FAQs--ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS
I’VE BEEN ASKED:
Why such a low
estimate on the ticket revenue and attendance? We based it on what we have brought in over the last 3 plays.  We sell some tickets on Goldstar for half price.   We discount a lot to bring people in. Hopefully, more tickets will be sold,
A lot of people have said that they didn’t know about us.  Hopefully, that will change when we have a season and can
sell subscriptions and “flexpasses.”
You can help remedy this: tell everyone you know that there
is live theatre on Piedmont Avenue!).
How much have we spent so far?
In the last year we have produced 3 plays and 3 staged
readings.                             We have spent over $35,000.  The Producer put up his own money to fund the productions.   None of the budget reflects any repayment of that amount.
Why is the rent so
low on Piedmont Avenue?
We would be sharing the space with another tenant.  We would have access on Saturday nights and
Sundays…which means we have to set up all the sets, lights, etc., then
dismantle everything each weekend.  
Thus our schedule of playing 3 performances per week on
Saturday evening , Sunday Matinee, and Sunday evening for 5 weeks per
production.
It’s too hard to park
on Piedmont Avenue
We go to the movies, we go to restaurants, we go to the
gyms, we go shopping, we go to the beauty parlor, and always find a place to park.                               HOWEVER, Wells Fargo has generously offered their 20 space
parking lot to us after their 6 pm closing.                                                                                                         We will offer this as a perk to the first 20 who contribute
$100 for the Reception, and to our first subscribers (when we get a full season and can sell subscriptions).
How do we select the plays?
As is usual, the artistic director
decides the season.  This year, we are
inviting our audience to weigh in on which plays they prefer from a list. 
John McMullen says, ""Here is what I think about when selecting a
play: does it touch me emotionally and tickle my brain?  Do I have the actors to
play the roles? Will it make my audience want to come and see it? We have a
“company” of actors who we tend to consider when choosing plays. 
Why not apply for grants?
 It seems that you have to be in business for about three years before they take you seriously.   Lots of the money for arts grants has shrunk, but we will be applying soon. 
Can I deduct this?
If we raise the $13K, yes, you will
be able to deduct it from this year’s taxes.
We are awaiting our 501c3 nonprofit
status, but it is a sure thing and retroactive to when we incorporated.
If we don’t raise it, you get your
money back.
Who is behind all this?
Producer John McMullen has an MFA in
directing from Carnegie Mellon, and lots of experience acting, directing, and
teaching at Carnegie Mellon, City College of San Francisco, and Los Medanos
College.
For the last 4 years, he has been the
theatre critic for the Berkeley Daily Planet—but his theatre friends tease him
that, “He has come back from the dark side.”

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>With a new year comes a brand new focus, the Limelight Theatre Company, bringing new works, new voices, and heartfelt stories to light centerstage. The Limelight Theatre Company was founded in response to the necessity for the continuation of the arts and uplifting the voices of our local artists and creators during a time of great challenge and change. The Limelight Theatre Company introduces its name with pride, as we emerge from a period of darkness with hopes to pave the way to more accessible, affordable, and enlightening dramatic art.</p>
<p>Join us and support us as we work to educate and enlighten our communities through the arts and place professional artists and creators in the limelight. The Limelight Theatre Company plans to provide an array of events in the future, including mainstage productions, staged readings, and concerts. Please support our mission by donating to our campaign. Your contribution will directly support the necessary funding to put artists and creators centerstage. We thank you and we welcome you to the Limelight Theatre Company.  ​</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $11,000. All funds raised will go directly towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production expenses for upcoming productions, staged readings and concerts</li>
<li>Licensing rights for theatrical works and concert materials </li>
<li>Hiring of performers, musicians and creative designers</li>
<li>Operational expenses</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a tremendous impact on the arts community. With many theaters shut down and permanently closed, artists and designers are out of work and the continuation of the arts is in jeopardy. This campaign will directly support the Limelight Theatre Company’s mission  by providing much-needed opportunities for professional artists and providing accessible and affordable arts experiences for communities in the Westchester, Putnam and the greater NY area. <br/> </p>

<h3>A Clear Road Ahead</h3>
<p>Our mission at the Limelight Theatre Company is to stimulate, promote, teach and develop interest in the dramatic arts; to enlighten and educate the general public in the dramatic arts; to advance the general level of culture in the field of dramatic arts by the establishment and maintenance of a theater community for the production of plays, musicals, readings, dramas, comedies, shows, concerts, and dramatic arts in all forms and of the highest standards; and to bring all aspects of the dramatic arts to areas and centers not adequately served at the present time. Furthermore, the Limelight Theatre Company works to share and raise the voices and inclusivity of all artists, cultures, and backgrounds in our performing arts community.</p>
<p>Led by founder Stephanie Scuderi, the Limelight Theatre Company was created with this determined mission and will stop at nothing to fulfill it! Stephanie Scuderi is also the Executive Director of Spotlight Arts, Inc., a nationally recognized and award-winning youth theatre company where Stephanie directs many of their mainstage productions, and single-handedly led the company through the global pandemic over the past year with new and innovative ways to safely continue to bring theatre to its audiences and artists. Stephanie is also on faculty at Temple University where she teaches voice to their B.F.A. Musical Theatre students. Stephanie's most recent and notable experiences in New York as a performer were her leading roles as Alice in Frank Wildhorn’s revised version of WONDERLAND at the Frederick Loewe Theater in New York, NY directed by Tony Nominee and award-winning director Gabriel Barre and the role of Gabby in CITY OF ANGELS at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York, NY directed by David Alpert and music direction by Ana Flavia Zuim.

</div></div>","Who We Are
With a new year comes a brand new focus, the Limelight Theatre Company, bringing new works, new voices, and heartfelt stories to light centerstage. The Limelight Theatre Company was founded in response to the necessity for the continuation of the arts and uplifting the voices of our local artists and creators during a time of great challenge and change. The Limelight Theatre Company introduces its name with pride, as we emerge from a period of darkness with hopes to pave the way to more accessible, affordable, and enlightening dramatic art.
Join us and support us as we work to educate and enlighten our communities through the arts and place professional artists and creators in the limelight. The Limelight Theatre Company plans to provide an array of events in the future, including mainstage productions, staged readings, and concerts. Please support our mission by donating to our campaign. Your contribution will directly support the necessary funding to put artists and creators centerstage. We thank you and we welcome you to the Limelight Theatre Company.  ​
 

What We Need
Our fundraising goal is $11,000. All funds raised will go directly towards:

Production expenses for upcoming productions, staged readings and concerts
Licensing rights for theatrical works and concert materials 
Hiring of performers, musicians and creative designers
Operational expenses

 

The Impact
Your contribution will make a tremendous impact on the arts community. With many theaters shut down and permanently closed, artists and designers are out of work and the continuation of the arts is in jeopardy. This campaign will directly support the Limelight Theatre Company’s mission  by providing much-needed opportunities for professional artists and providing accessible and affordable arts experiences for communities in the Westchester, Putnam and the greater NY area.  

A Clear Road Ahead

<h3>What is this ""punk theatre"" you refer to?</h3>
<p>Diagnostic Theatre Company is seeking funding for its inaugural season of punk theatre. ""Punk theatre"", as we call it, are performances that are work-shopped and produced under a strict adherence to a set of DIY ethics:</p>
<ul>
<li>DTC is a non-profit 501-c3 who donates its proceeds to charities and organizations that share our goals (i.e. Southern Poverty Law Center, Anti-Defamation League, Black Lives Matter, ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Hand in Hand for Syria).</li>
<li>Diagnostic believes that theatre, and ""high art"" in general, suffer from the haughty airs that surround it by excluding the wide swath of audience members who might be interested in attending, if only they could afford it. DTC believes you shouldn't need a disposable income to enjoy art and culture. There is no dress code, if you're a little late, you're fine.</li>
<li>Diagnostic Theatre Company will never have any corporate sponsorship. Ever. Funding is provided in part by grants and primarily through donations from supporters like you.</li>
<li>Admission to any and all DTC productions are pay-what-you-can in the form of donations to that show's selected charity and/or beneficiary.</li>
<li>DTC is committed to diversity and inclusion when it comes to casting, representation onstage, and the formation of original characters in new works. We firmly believe this is the way theatre, art, and America should be by default, so you will never see us making a hashtag out of it or exploiting it in any kind of marketing tactic to draw either crowds or funding.</li>
<li>DTC will prioritize the production of original works but will also produce new visions of classics, and productions of lesser-known modern works.</li>
<li>Street theatre workshopping of new works, house shows where available.</li>
<li>Hand-crafted/re-purposed/upcycled minimalist crowd-sourced sets, props, and costumes.</li>
<li>Original music by unsigned, DIY artists or Diagnostic artists only. Potential short musical sets by local punk bands before top of show and during intermissions.</li>
<li>Diagnostic believes in a power determined by the people, in an art that cannot be compromised. We believe, we will endure, and we will overcome.</li>
<li>Diagnostic is vehemently anti-fascist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite transparently, Diagnostic is a leftist company. We make no effort to hide that and will understand if you decide this is a deal-breaker.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In short, Diagnostic needs the start-up capital to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay artists and technicians a decent day rate</li>
<li>Rent rehearsal and performance spaces</li>
<li>Pay festival registration fees</li>
<li>Equipment cost and rental</li>
<li>Costumes and props</li>
<li>Royalties</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributions to Diagnostic Theatre's campaign will benefit the public by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing live theatre for and inspired by the proletariat</li>
<li>Helping to sustain a culture of constructive resistance against the current administration</li>
<li>Peacefully protest the establishment through art and performance, rather than violence</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously these are divisive times, and this is a potentially divisive stance for a non-profit to take. But Diagnostic is not intimidated by this culture of monologue, rather, we look forward to helping us all move towards a culture of dialogue. We are confident we can overcome these obstacles by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remaining steadfast in the belief in love and cooperation</li>
<li>Celebrating each other</li>
</ul>

<p>Each year, we depend on donations from festival goers and various grants to help offset the cost of the festival that has become a Boulder tradition since the original Folkfest in 1981. <a href=""https://boulderdance.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/INTrl.-FESTIVAL-HISTORY-5_15.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(click here for more history)</a> As a 501(c)3 non-profit, our budget has limitations and so we are reaching out to the public in hopes of raising funds to help sustain and grow the Boulder International Festival.</p>

<p>The festival kicks off with a public Salsa dance on Friday night followed by participatory international folk dancing with music by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BarbelfishBand/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Barbelfish Balkan Band</a> on Saturday evening with a variety of dance lessons and demonstrations from performers throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>To put this all together requires a budget of just over $10,000. We are hoping to raise $2,000 through crowdfunding to:</p>

<h3>Who we are and what we do:</h3>
<p>We are Joe, Poppy and Molly, the core team behind The Cardboard Rocketship, a brand new theatre company based in Manchester, producing exciting and relevant work by young people. We set up at the start of lockdown to give young creatives a way to stay creative and collaborative, and create relevant and immediate theatre from young peoples' perspective. We are raising money to help get us off the ground, and what we raise will first and foremost go towards setting ourselves up as a community interest company and producing our second project, a piece which heavily relies on a printed element. The piece will be a celebration and exploration of young people's relationship to protest. All profits made from  it will go towards charities supporting and championing equality and intersectionality in the UK. Anything left over from fundraising will be put into delivering further projects, events and engagement activities such as workshops. Our main aim as a company is to give young people the space and opportunity to make work that is relevant and exciting to them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we are fundraising for:</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise £500. This will be more than enough to cover the printing costs for our second project, set ourselves up as a community interest company and begin to deliver an exciting, diverse and inclusive programme of online (for now) events and opportunities for young theatre makers and creatives. This is an extremely tough time for theatre, and it is more than likely that one of the aspects of theatre's that could suffer the most is their youth programmes, which are extremely important to thousands of young theatre makers, performers and writers across the country, including us. In an uncertain time, we are aiming to provide a space for these young people to thrive, allowing them to keep creative, develop their skills and make work that is relevant and vital to them.</p>
<h3>The reason we’re fundraising:</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Up until now, we have been self-financing the company and it's activities ourselves. This is something we are more than happy to do, but as young people this takes up a sizeable proportion of our income. As we want to reach out to more and more young people to get involved, and produce our work in various formats, it is becoming increasingly unviable to finance this ourselves. Any support you can provide would be invaluable and vital.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help:</h3>
<p> If you can't donate, but still want to help out, there are a number of ways you can:</p>
<p>- Give us advice!

</div><p> </p></div>","Who we are and what we do:
We are Joe, Poppy and Molly, the core team behind The Cardboard Rocketship, a brand new theatre company based in Manchester, producing exciting and relevant work by young people. We set up at the start of lockdown to give young creatives a way to stay creative and collaborative, and create relevant and immediate theatre from young peoples' perspective. We are raising money to help get us off the ground, and what we raise will first and foremost go towards setting ourselves up as a community interest company and producing our second project, a piece which heavily relies on a printed element. The piece will be a celebration and exploration of young people's relationship to protest. All profits made from  it will go towards charities supporting and championing equality and intersectionality in the UK. Anything left over from fundraising will be put into delivering further projects, events and engagement activities such as workshops. Our main aim as a company is to give young people the space and opportunity to make work that is relevant and exciting to them.

What we are fundraising for:
We are trying to raise £500. This will be more than enough to cover the printing costs for our second project, set ourselves up as a community interest company and begin to deliver an exciting, diverse and inclusive programme of online (for now) events and opportunities for young theatre makers and creatives. This is an extremely tough time for theatre, and it is more than likely that one of the aspects of theatre's that could suffer the most is their youth programmes, which are extremely important to thousands of young theatre makers, performers and writers across the country, including us. In an uncertain time, we are aiming to provide a space for these young people to thrive, allowing them to keep creative, develop their skills and make work that is relevant and vital to them.
The reason we’re fundraising:
Up until now, we have been self-financing the company and it's activities ourselves. This is something we are more than happy to do, but as young people this takes up a sizeable proportion of our income. As we want to reach out to more and more young people to get involved, and produce our work in various formats, it is becoming increasingly unviable to finance this ourselves. Any support you can provide would be invaluable and vital.

Other ways you can help:
 If you can't donate, but still want to help out, there are a number of ways you can:
- Give us advice! If you are a theatre professional or have any knowledge of running a small (or any other sized) arts organisation, any advice and expertise you could lend us would be extremely helpful.

<h3>Monuments Community Tour 2018: LEAR  </h3>
<p>Hi there!<br/>My name is Adam Boyle, and I am the Artistic Director of Bears &amp; Vagabonds Productions. We at Bears &amp; Vagabonds are dedicated to championing important social and ethical causes through theatre and community. <br/><br/>We are currently gearing up for our next community Shakespeare tour. This year our production will be Shakespeare's King Lear, which we will be bringing to community venues throughout Greater London, East Anglia &amp; Kent.</p>
<p><br/>The production will be offered to communities on a 'pay what you feel' basis to help encourage engagement through  the arts from more non-traditional theatre goers - so, basically, people can come for free!</p>
<p>Lear will be an up-to-date production of William Shakespeare’s ‘King Lear’, exploring themes of home, homeless and the refugee crisis.<br/>The production will follow the story of a female Lear, who divides her land between her three daughters tracking the breakdown of her relationships with these daughters and other friends, and the loss of her home, largely due to her own battle with mental health, whilst also exploring the effect that this has on those around them.  </p>
<p>We are targeting our production for community audiences, and want to make it as accessible as possible.   It will be a playful, ensemble piece, including folk singing, puppetry and physical theatre, whilst bringing out the comedy of the piece.</p>
<p>A percentage of the donated box office will be donated to our chosen charity for this production, Emmaus. Emmaus is a fantastic homeless charity, which gives an opportunity for people to work their way out of homelessness, providing meaningful work as well as a stable home for as long as someone needs it.  You can learn more about Emmaus here: <a href=""https://www.emmaus.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.emmaus.org.uk/</a></p>
<p>We ran a successful small-scale tour early this year of two Shakespeare plays-in-rep (The Winter’s Tale and Richard II), raising £300 for The Mental Health Foundation. This time we want to up our game. We have more community venues lined up, we will be engaging with more people, offering free educational workshops alongside the performances, and hope to raise even more money for our chosen charities.<br/><br/>Please do take a look at our incentives and do what you can to support our project. Every little really does help. Please do also check us out on social media on the links below, and come check out one of our performances.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Bears &amp; Vagabonds Productions</p>

Fuller</a> and together founded the Eagle &amp; Beaver Ensemble, a London based theatre company seeking to bring North America closer to Europe.</p>
<p>We are both actors as well as producers, individually, before finding each other and deciding to unite!  Georgia succesfully produced a short run of Fat Girl by Neil LaBute a couple of years ago, and currently has several film scripts in various stages of production.  Lance has also successfully produced many shows, including some with his improv group.</p>
<p>We decided to create the <strong>Eagle &amp; Beaver Ensemble</strong> as a way to highlight all the North American talent in London as well as Europe.  The thirst for American-centric shows keeps growing and we felt that the real North American talent here should be given a platform.  We also wanted to give a platform for emerging playwrights in the United States and Canada, and the opportunity to have a show staged at a London theatre.</p>
<p>Our first production,<strong> <a href=""http://uniontheatre.biz/tiny-shorts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tiny Shorts</a></strong>, is based around the themes of ""independence"" and ""freedom"" to coincide with Canada Day (July 1st) and United Stated Independence Day (July 4th).  All the plays were commissioned around these themes.</p>
<p>Our production will be the official launch of our company and there is no better place than the award winning theatre, <a href=""http://www.uniontheatre.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Union Theatre</a> to house us.  We envisage this production to be the start of similar productions in the future, based around typical North American key themes from holidays (have you heard of Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly Day?) to weird customs.  You might even see the odd Mountie.</p>
<p>As producers, we are keen to give our cast members a great experience, and your wonderful contribution can help us achieve this, along with the initial seed money donated by the American Actors UK organisation (<a href=""http://www.americanactorsuk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AAUK</a>).  Requests could be anything from:</p>
<p>-  giving them a safe rehearsal place where they can explore the plays and their characters, and relieve the stress of trying to find rehearsal space. Most rehearsal space in London will go between £15 to £30 an hour.  As we'll have 8 plays and a cast of almost 20, that's a lot of hours!<br/>- any props/costumes needed for their chosen play<br/>- clearance on any music we might need to play on the night<br/>- a technician for light and sound<br/>- any insurance needed</p>
<p>And probably countless other issues that will no doubt arise.  This contingency pot will put everyone's minds at ease, and the directors and actors can focus on what they do best: giving us the best performance possible.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise £500 or anything close to that amount.  This would go towards:</p>

Az
összegyűlt pénzzel a Magyarországra menekült rászorulókon
segítünk.


Adj, hogy üdvözülj!

Ez a karma törvényének alkalmazása.

A középkorban az emberek olyannyira hittek benne, hogy búcsúcédulákat vásároltak az Egyháztól. Pénzt adtak az Egyháznak azért, hogy az, mint egy ""cég"" megszabadítsa őket bűneiktől isten színe előtt.

Az már mindegy, hogy HOGYAN adsz. Természetben vagy pénzben. Ahogy neked kényelmesebb.Ha neked az kényelmesebb, hogy személyesen viszel ételt, italt, jó szót a menekülteknek, akkor tedd ezt.Ha te erre nem érsz rá, és egyébként is, inkább fizetsz profi segítőcsapatnak, akkor utalj pénzt. Mi nem csinálunk mást, mint összegyűjtjük és professzionális segítőket bízunk meg a feladattal.

Mi is gyűjtünk, mások is gyűjtenek. Mi ezt az üzenetet fűzzük a gyűjtési akciónkhoz és azoknak az adományait várjuk, akiket személyesen megérintett az üzenetünk.Az emberek abban nem tévedtek, hogy fizettek az Egyháznak. Abban tévedtek, hogy kecskére bízták a káposztát.

Nem bújhatsz ki ez alól.Jó tett helyébe jót várj! Isten nem ver bottal. E két alternatívát kínálja az élet.Adj, hogy üdvözülj!

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>This project will successfully bridge the boarders of performing arts and education in unusual way, in our workshops young people will get to physically experience the power of theatre through classes in their schools, in a way which has inspired many a student in the UK as a result of a Joint Stock theatre, Frantic Assembly or Rambert workshop. The second key part of this project is working with teachers in Kunungu, in partnership with Limited Resource Teacher Training (LRTT)to build their confidence as educational drama specialists allowing teachers to further increase the tools in their toolbox to deliver inclusive and engaging education across the curriculum.</p>
<p>The final, but imperative aspect is a performance of a well known play which will go through a new treatment in rehearsal, where the actors and director will explore the boundaries of their skills and knowledge as African theatre and European theatre techniques merge.</p>
<h3>Who:</h3>
<p><u>Lucinda Bray</u> is a UK based theatre director, facilitator and teacher who has worked in regional theatre in the UK for over 10 years. She has produced and directed a broad range of productions working with actors with a variety of training and experience.  She is specialises in devising.</p>
<p> As an educator she has been working in formal and informal education settings since 2006, often using drama as a teaching tool, particularly for language teaching, or the exploration of issues such as relationships and bullying. </p>
<p><strong><u>Benjamin Egesa Osipo</u></strong> is the other half of the production team and is based in Kampala UGANDA.</p>
<p>He is a radio journalist and a sports commentator with Uganda Broadcasting Corporation 's Sports Channel Magic 100fm. </p>
<p>As a performing artist, he was trained and performed with the world renowned Ndere Troupe and as such bares an acute understanding of the African traditions, culture and performing arts.</p>
<p>An extremely versatile performer with a gift for words, this will be his return to the performing arts after a seven year sabbatical and will in essence be tasked with linking the unique dramatic techniques brought forth by Lucinda to the cultural context within the script and reproduce a masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>Product:</strong></p>
<p>Written in the 1970’s Betrayal in the City sensitively draws out the challenges of creating a Nation; new culture, new societal hierarchies, who are the friends and who are the foe? How do you respect the past whilst moving forward?  </p>
<p>The cast will be entirely Ugandan with a British director, this cross cultural collaboration will allow for a new interpretation of a text which may be well known to the audience. It will also allow for experimentation with dramatic technique. Utilising the skills and experience of the cast and merging this with European approaches to theatre.</p>
<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>The theatrical styles of Britain and Uganda and the rehearsal processes can be quite different, the collaboration between cast and director offers the chance to explore these differences and take risks in rehearsal to create a production of the play that offers something new to both sides and the audience, however well they know the play.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a budget of £3000 to cover costs of the project which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees for our hardworking actors and equally important stage team.</li>
<li>Equipment hire</li>
<li>The creation of our simple but fabulous set.</li>
<li>Logistics including transport to rural and inner city schools, accommodation during teacher training workshops.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not meet our goal the funds will still be used to carry out the project, but it will be much harder to create our vision.</p>
<p>Your financial support for the project will yield a variety of rewards including producer credits and video footage from rehearsal and interviews or couching from the director.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:54.0pt;""> </p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a number of challenges of this project the major one is the director being so far away until the last minute, it creates additional issues with casting and the usual challenges of producing  a play are heightened by this. The timescale of delivery is very tight, all parties will be working together very closely to ensure that the project is a success.</p>
<p>Fortunately the challenges are the sort the team are used to working with; small budgets, a lack of time and a great deal of unknowns. Lucinda is particularly adept at working with a lack of resources, having produced plays in a week before, including the renovation of non-theatre spaces into a comfortable performance venue. She has experience working abroad most recently working for Limited Resource Teacher Training in Guyana during 2016.</p>
<p>Benjemin has a track record of bringing together excellent creative teams in Kampala as well as excellent contacts within the creative industries there.</p>
<p>At the heart of our work is a sense of collaboration which cannot fail to yield results.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! </p>
<p>My name is Emelia Koberg and I am in love with dance. I have been since I was a child but I allowed myself to get pulled in other directions, other people's ideas of what and who I should become. I didn't listen to the voice inside that wanted to express through movement my thoughts and feelings especially about injustice in the world, the contradictions of pain and pleasure, of desires and of love. </p>
<p>Last year I finally realized I could no longer ignore this voice and went to study dance and Somatics in Finland despite the empty bank account and threw myself whole heartedly into the passion of moving, finding new limits and new abilities. In March I attended a life-changing 2 week dance training called Depth Movement with Edivaldo Ernesto that pushed my physical, emotional and psychological limits. We danced 4 hours straight everyday without a break, finding more and more power from a deep source within; a desire to express, to play, to feel, to be fully alive.  In June, I attended another training with the maestro of floorwork, David Zambrano and again I was challenged to new lengths, finding ways to gather and send energy, to feel stress and joy at the same time, to connect deeply to myself while connecting to the whole group. This training is about new ways of being and relating to ourselves and to each other in the world. </p>
<p>I came to Greece to train with fellow dancer and teacher to train and begin collaborating with Vicky Angelidou. I had of course heard about Exin, a 1 month long training with David Zambrano assisted by Edivaldo Ernesto and Milan Herich that she and many others I know are attending. I had not applied because I didn't have the money or the belief I would be really ready. A week after arriving and training with Vicky, I was encouraged by a fellow dancer from the Barcelona training to write to them because he heard of a cancellation. I didn't think I would get in with the course starting September 1st since other people are on the waiting list but low and behold I was. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.exindance.com/page2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.exindance.com/page2</a></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>I am turning 30 September 23rd, an important marker in life. There is no better present I could imagine than dancing for 7 hours everyday with inspiring teachers and other dancers from all over the world. With this training, I know I will emerge as a new person and dancer and performer. This leads me to the second part of the dream: to start an intercultural dance project creating performances and teaching youth from different backgrounds, cultures and  experiences. I plan to start this in Sweden first and expand to other places. </p>
<h3><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p>The training has naturally some costs: it is €2400 which includes accommodation, food and of course the teaching. Maybe that seems like a lot of money but it is basically a condensed study year but more powerful because of its immersive nature and working so closely with the teachers and other students. I assure you I will dance my ass off for every cent I receive. </p>
<p>I am also applying for a travel grant from the Swedish Arts Council, however, it takes 6-8 weeks to process and I have no guarantee if I will receive it. If I do, I will ask you how you would like the money to be used, for example, I could use it to to offer more classes and workshops and make videos of performances/research. </p>
<p>In return, I will offer dance classes and workshops that you can either attend or provide a scholarship to someone who would not otherwise be able to attend. </p>
<p>If you are more interested in acroyoga, yoga or meditation, I will offer some classes that you can attend in person or as a video recording. </p>

<p><b><i>He started the Sexual Revolution and believed
he discovered the energy of life itself…</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>In the end, he was hounded and imprisoned,
and became the only citizen and scientist in American history to have his work
burned by both the Nazis and the U.S. government…</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The Last of Wilhelm Reich</i> brings to life the dramatic saga of a
visionary, tormented genius who wanted to change the world, but was met with
ridicule and persecution.</p>
<p>In
this stirring new play, Wilhelm
Reich, controversial proponent of orgone energy, enlists the audience in a
quest for the truth. “The whole world,” Reich declares, “may call you mad, but
it is only true if you are wrong!” </p>
<p>What if that truth is not
acknowledged or understood for centuries? For Reich, it meant facing ostracism
and arrest to pursue his vision of a better world. </p>
<p>In <i>The Last of Wilhelm Reich</i>, he relives the chronicle of his life and
loves – the traumatic suicide of his mother; the fears of abandonment that
begin in childhood and haunt him through adulthood; the tempestuous, conflicted
relationships he has with his father, brother, wives, and children; the initial
triumphs of his scientific and socio-political achievements, including
Character Analysis and the Sexual Revolution; and the repression of his theory
of orgone energy, leading to persecution, imprisonment, and the actual burning
of his life’s work. </p>
<p><i>The Last of Wilhelm Reich</i> has a cinematic, stream-of-conscious
structure, as Reich communicates directly with audience members and guides them
through scenes of his life history. His guidance, however, is challenged by a
Lear-like struggle to hold on in the face of personal and political torment.</p>
<p>Reich’s tragic life ends
with death in prison – but his passionate refusal to cower or abandon his
beliefs remains courageous and inspiring. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed</h3> <p></p>
<p>After a year of workshop development, your
help is needed to bring this play to life – first Off-Broadway, and then on tour
around the world.</p>
<p>This is a ""Fixed Funding"" campaign, and there are 60 days to reach the funding goal. If the initial funding goal is not reached, all contributions will be returned to you by Indiegogo.

</div></div>","He started the Sexual Revolution and believed
he discovered the energy of life itself…
In the end, he was hounded and imprisoned,
and became the only citizen and scientist in American history to have his work
burned by both the Nazis and the U.S. government…

The Last of Wilhelm Reich brings to life the dramatic saga of a
visionary, tormented genius who wanted to change the world, but was met with
ridicule and persecution.
In
this stirring new play, Wilhelm
Reich, controversial proponent of orgone energy, enlists the audience in a
quest for the truth. “The whole world,” Reich declares, “may call you mad, but
it is only true if you are wrong!” 
What if that truth is not
acknowledged or understood for centuries? For Reich, it meant facing ostracism
and arrest to pursue his vision of a better world. 
In The Last of Wilhelm Reich, he relives the chronicle of his life and
loves – the traumatic suicide of his mother; the fears of abandonment that
begin in childhood and haunt him through adulthood; the tempestuous, conflicted
relationships he has with his father, brother, wives, and children; the initial
triumphs of his scientific and socio-political achievements, including
Character Analysis and the Sexual Revolution; and the repression of his theory
of orgone energy, leading to persecution, imprisonment, and the actual burning
of his life’s work. 
The Last of Wilhelm Reich has a cinematic, stream-of-conscious
structure, as Reich communicates directly with audience members and guides them
through scenes of his life history. His guidance, however, is challenged by a
Lear-like struggle to hold on in the face of personal and political torment.
Reich’s tragic life ends
with death in prison – but his passionate refusal to cower or abandon his
beliefs remains courageous and inspiring. 

What Is Needed 
After a year of workshop development, your
help is needed to bring this play to life – first Off-Broadway, and then on tour
around the world.
This is a ""Fixed Funding"" campaign, and there are 60 days to reach the funding goal. If the initial funding goal is not reached, all contributions will be returned to you by Indiegogo. Once the funding goal is reached, the campaign will attain ""In Demand"" status after 60 days, so Stretch Goals can continue to be funded.
The starting budget of $125,000 will fund a
limited run at an Off-Broadway theater. 
Stretch goals will finance the hiring of an
illustrious cast and production team, a special effects budget, and an expanded
advertising campaign.
“Dream” casting for Wilhelm Reich includes:

</h2><p><strong>Sara Mayfield</strong> is a queer french Canadian director, actress, writer and theatre technician. She is a graduate of Capilano University’s Musical Theatre program, where she got experience writing and directing several scenes. In the summer of 2018, Sara was a contracted actor in <i>Skis and Skates,</i> an original musical about the first women's hockey tournament in Canada. She originated a role in the show, as well as helped create songs for the show playing both the guitar and French Canadian spoons. Her experience working on this new show has given her insight into the play development process, which is essential to this project. After this show, Sara was cast in Shakespeare Canada’s touring production of <i>The Tempest</i>, playing Antonia, Ferdinand, and Stephano. In addition to these professional acting contracts, Sara has been present in many community theatre productions since her debut in 2013, most recently appearing in <i>Mamma Mia</i> at the Abbotsford Arts Center. She is currently part of the main cast for <i>Tabletop Tiddies,</i> a queer and feminist Dungeons and Dragons podcast streamed live on Twitch Tuesday nights at 7pm and available on all podcasting mediums. She is a producer as well as cast on this show, organising advertising, podcast cross promotion, and acting as the show’s publicist.</p><p>Prior to going to school for musical theatre, Sara made it a priority to learn the technical elements of theatre. She was the props manager and special effect coordinator for <i>Carrie: The Musical</i> and stage managed <i>Virgins: A Musical Threesome</i> with Fighting Chance Productions. She has also worked in various roles for Theatre under the Stars (two seasons working front of house) and Awkward Stage Productions (assistant stage manager, runner, follow spot operator). These experiences, in addition to a production and technical theatre class at Capilano University, will help ensure that <i>The Girl Next Door</i> is a success!

These inciting circumstances awaken once-dormant emotions and memories inside our protagonist, allowing the audience to experience the highs and lows of each relationship through flashbacks as well as events in the present time.

<h3>Jez Dolan and Joshua Val Martin are making a new performance</h3>
<p>Jez and Joshua are making a new show 'Double-Ender'. #DoubleEnder</p>
<p>Double-Ender tells our story. How we are affected by the gentrification and homogenisation of our city, its changing attitudes to LGBTQ people, the language we use, and how easy it is to forget our own history.</p>
<p>Double-Ender is a new collaboration between visual artist Jez Dolan and playwright Joshual Val Martin that uses storytelling to explore the cultural capital of queerness.</p>
<p>Taking as its starting point the psycho-geography of the city and Polari - the lost language of gay men, hear the story of how Joshua took fetish clubs on historical walking tours of Manchester, and how cottaging can lead to long-term love. Discover how language can both reveal queer identity and obscure its content to the uninitiated, see how cities can grow and change, both for the better and for the worse, shaping attitudes towards queer people.</p>
<p>Dolan and Martin bring together their work for the first time to create a fast-paced show that both informs and entertains.</p>
<p>We can only make this show with your support.  Your contribution will help pay for the basic costs of rehearsing and mounting the show and lead to presentations in Manchester, Bury and Oldham.  If these work, we'll aim to send Double-Ender out on an extensive tour of England and beyond in 2021.</p>
<p>DUE TO COVID-19 OUR PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN KNOCKED BACK TO LATER IN THE YEAR - HOWEVER WE ARE STILL MAKING THE SHOW!</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>SENSUMtheatre are a devised performance company set up by six students at the University of Cumbria Institute of the Arts, formed in May 2018 during our second year at University. Now in our third year, we are currently in the process of producing, devising and choreographing three new and exciting pieces of work as part of our final module at the University of Cumbria. These productions include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel (10th and 11th May, Stanwix Main House Theatre) - an original dance theatre production that explores human experience and how our relationship with others can affect our sense of identity. <br/> </li>
<li>Lady Ella (22nd May, Stanwix Studio Theatre) – a cabaret performance inspired by the life and music of Ella Fitzgerald. <br/> </li>
<li>Road To Nowhere (25th and 26th May, Stanwix Studio Theatre) – an original drama production inspired by current social issues such as gender inequalities, mental health and how our upbringing and the people around us can affect our sense of identity. </li>
</ul>
<p>As a team, we create all our productions from scratch with no initial access to funding. All money raised through our fundraising efforts will provide us with essential materials to help create our set, props, and costume for each performance. This will, in turn, allow us to create the best possible theatre experience for you, our audience. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>At SENSUMtheatre, we wish to bring the experience of contemporary theatre to wider audiences with a range of fresh and exciting performances that subvert traditional theatre values. By using the human condition and the modern world as a stimulus for our work, we aspire to create socially relevant performances that both captivate and resonate with a variety of audiences and their own experience. Using a diverse range of theatre disciplines; including acting, music, physical theatre, and dance, we aim to challenge the social expectations of theatre and live performance – proving that it can be an enjoyable experience for all. </p>
<h3><strong>Our Team</strong></h3>
<p>At SENSUMtheatre, we take pride in being a theatre company with a difference. Each company member of SENSUMtheatre is actively involved in the creative, devising and performance process of each project. You can find out more about our team members and their role within the company, here: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541768694/x0zkiyvpld6dya4fgq9t.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Poppy Rowan: </strong>Poppy is currently in the process of co-writing, devising and performing in SENSUMtheatre's upcoming Production ‘Road to Nowhere’ alongside company member, Jordan. She says ‘Road to Nowhere’ has been such a challenging but thrilling experience. We hope to shed light onto a number of suppressed subjects and inspire people to challenge their own way of thinking.’ On top of this, they are taking on the set design, stage management, and marketing, alongside Carmen. She is thrilled to also be stage managing and performing in ‘Parallel.’ After university, Poppy aims to continue creating original works and to remain an active member of this immensely unique company.</p>

<p><strong>Callum Jordan:</strong> Callum is currently choreographing and creating SENSUMtheatre’s upcoming dance production, Parallel, alongside Ria John. “Parallel feels like such an important project for myself as an artist as I feel that we all struggle with our sense of identity but it’s never really spoken about and we’re just expected to get on with it. Being able to address this through dance has been a real learning experience not only as a choreographer but as a person” he explains. Callum is also thrilled to be on board as lighting designer for Road To Nowhere. He hopes to continue a career in choreography and movement direction after university and is excited about his future with SENSUMtheatre.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541768748/vjr9wvgbfxtqegm7db0o.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Ria John: </strong>Ria is currently choreographing for SENSUMtheatre’s upcoming dance production, Parallel.  Ria is enjoying being able to explore the concept of identity with Parallel as she feels “it is something we all struggle with at some point in our lives. Either we don’t feel good enough or we feel that we're constantly living to please. With Parallel, we hope to prove that individuality and identity are more important than trying to conform to the rules that society sets us. As a choreographer, I feel it is important to talk about these issues and address them in a way that I’m passionate about.” After her time at university, Ria hopes to continue working as a choreographer alongside SENSUMtheatre.</p>

<p><strong>Jordan Tones: </strong>Jordan believes that when he was growing up the conversation surrounding masculinity and femininity was never a topic of discussion, fast forward to today and when the conversation is brought up, it quickly turns toxic and further away, we drift. For Jordan’s next production, he is teaming up with Poppy Rowan to create an original drama production ‘Road to Nowhere'. Jordan says, “I’m exactly where I want to be, creating a full production from start to finish, with this production I’m hoping to open a discussion, shed some light on a conversation that gets massively overlooked”. Finally, he hopes to continue creating and learning new methods of performance so he is able to travel and continue working within the arts. Finally, Jordan looks to continue his work with SENSUMtheatre and is excited about the future with such a great bunch of creatives. </p>

<p><strong>Carmen Teppett:</strong> Carmen is currently working on her production Lady Ella, she is loving working on this piece especially working with Ella Fitzgerald's music as she is a huge fan of her and her incredible vocals. Carmen has worked on creating this piece from scratch and is passionate about building and designing the set and lights to create an authentic aesthetic for the performance. She is also working with the team of Parallel as a performer in their piece which she is thrilled to be a part of. Carmen is hoping to pursue a career in performing after graduating from the University of Cumbria and is excited for what is to come with SENSUMtheatre.   </p>

<p><strong>Jayden Malabre:</strong> Jayden has been a dedicated company member of SENSUMtheatre from the very start, working in collaboration with the team to produce soundscapes for both Observation1 and Utopia. She is currently taking part in the production of Avenue Q, playing the role of Gary Coleman as part of her final project for University, but continues to work alongside company members in exploring sound, producing soundscapes and show tracks for both their upcoming shows ‘Parallel’ and ‘Road to Nowhere’.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise £500 to help develop our business, we have fundraised in venues around Carlisle and our crowdfunding page is to help us reach our goal for our future performances. </p>
<p>As our company grows we wish to be able to purchase better quality equipment in order to enhance our performances, and in turn enhance the overall experience for our audience members. This equipment will vary from a range of things such as higher quality sound and lighting technology, more marketing products and memorabilia for our audiences, to more technical set designs which are crucial to our performances where we aim to create a new world inside our performance venue.</p>
<p>All of the funds we raise are put towards our companies growth, whether it be for our technology, set or venue hire, we are passionate about building our company and taking our unique productions to further venues in the near future.</p>

Callum Jordan: Callum is currently choreographing and creating SENSUMtheatre’s upcoming dance production, Parallel, alongside Ria John. “Parallel feels like such an important project for myself as an artist as I feel that we all struggle with our sense of identity but it’s never really spoken about and we’re just expected to get on with it. Being able to address this through dance has been a real learning experience not only as a choreographer but as a person” he explains. Callum is also thrilled to be on board as lighting designer for Road To Nowhere. He hopes to continue a career in choreography and movement direction after university and is excited about his future with SENSUMtheatre.

Ria John: Ria is currently choreographing for SENSUMtheatre’s upcoming dance production, Parallel.  Ria is enjoying being able to explore the concept of identity with Parallel as she feels “it is something we all struggle with at some point in our lives. Either we don’t feel good enough or we feel that we're constantly living to please. With Parallel, we hope to prove that individuality and identity are more important than trying to conform to the rules that society sets us. As a choreographer, I feel it is important to talk about these issues and address them in a way that I’m passionate about.” After her time at university, Ria hopes to continue working as a choreographer alongside SENSUMtheatre.

Jordan Tones: Jordan believes that when he was growing up the conversation surrounding masculinity and femininity was never a topic of discussion, fast forward to today and when the conversation is brought up, it quickly turns toxic and further away, we drift. For Jordan’s next production, he is teaming up with Poppy Rowan to create an original drama production ‘Road to Nowhere'. Jordan says, “I’m exactly where I want to be, creating a full production from start to finish, with this production I’m hoping to open a discussion, shed some light on a conversation that gets massively overlooked”. Finally, he hopes to continue creating and learning new methods of performance so he is able to travel and continue working within the arts. Finally, Jordan looks to continue his work with SENSUMtheatre and is excited about the future with such a great bunch of creatives. 

Carmen Teppett: Carmen is currently working on her production Lady Ella, she is loving working on this piece especially working with Ella Fitzgerald's music as she is a huge fan of her and her incredible vocals. Carmen has worked on creating this piece from scratch and is passionate about building and designing the set and lights to create an authentic aesthetic for the performance. She is also working with the team of Parallel as a performer in their piece which she is thrilled to be a part of. Carmen is hoping to pursue a career in performing after graduating from the University of Cumbria and is excited for what is to come with SENSUMtheatre.   

Jayden Malabre: Jayden has been a dedicated company member of SENSUMtheatre from the very start, working in collaboration with the team to produce soundscapes for both Observation1 and Utopia. She is currently taking part in the production of Avenue Q, playing the role of Gary Coleman as part of her final project for University, but continues to work alongside company members in exploring sound, producing soundscapes and show tracks for both their upcoming shows ‘Parallel’ and ‘Road to Nowhere’.

<h3>ABOUT ZAYO:</h3>
<p>ZAYO is a memoir of dancer, choreographer and creative director Esie Mensah. This piece uses movement and dance to showcase the obstacles and challenges Esie has faced throughout her own artistic career. It is a piece that pays respect and gratitude towards her mentors who have helped guide her along her journey. The combined elements of Esie’s drive and determination along with the encouragement of her mentors helped shape Esie into the person who she is today.</p>
<p>Along with being a memoir, ZAYO is also an ode to Africa with the exploration of Esie’s Afrofusion movement in a new, fresh and contemporary way. In the show, a young man named, Ouhna arrives in the world of Nxi and has one directive: get to his destiny. Through a series of tests that will measure his mental, physical, and emotional strength, he must find what it takes to complete his quest, or the journey will consume him. Director and Choreographer Esie Mensah creates an ethereal future world with performers Kwasi Obeng, Lauren Lyn, Daniel Gomez, Amanda Videla, Shaiann Roach, and Benjamin Smalls in this bold new dance-theatre work about self-discovery, destiny, and personal strength.</p>
<p>The spirit of ZAYO (means future in Zulu) is homage to honour her ancestors. It’s to honour her guides from across the globe. A channel of strength, love and dedication for the people that need to hear it.</p>
<h3>ABOUT ESIE:</h3>

But Michael absolutely loved comic books… they were his refuge from bullies and irate baseball coaches. In fact, he loved them so much, he had thousands stacked in his dad’s garage, and he knew all the stories by heart.</p><p>Michael’s passion for comics led to a unique dream… not dreaming of BEING a superhero like many boys his age, but of something a little more unusual… he dreamed of SAVING his superhero. </p><p>Devastated by how his “dark knight” was portrayed as a campy joke in the 1960’s television series, Michael made a solemn vow to find a way to show the world the “true” Batman – the dark and serious avenger portrayed in the early comic books. This vow became Michael’s life’s work – and despite all obstacles – including being a nobody with no connections to Hollywood or to the comic book industry – Michael believed in his heart of hearts that he would be the guy to bring the world’s first “serious” superhero movie to the silver screen – and when he did it, the movie would be starring his favorite caped crusader.</p><p><strong>DUH, THAT SOUNDS OBVIOUS</strong></p><p>Well, back in the 1970s and 1980s, this idea was not obvious at all. In fact, no one had ever done a serious comic book feature film before. </p><p>The thing you have to understand is that back then, comics were not the super-cool billion dollar franchises that they are today. The Batman TV series was pure camp, and even the Superman movies lacked the dark nuances of the more complicated – and perhaps more compelling – superheroes of today. In fact, no one had ever done a “serious” comic book movie before. So when Michael finally obtained the rights to Batman, Hollywood executives simply didn’t believe there was an audience for his vision.  Every single studio turned him down.</p><p><strong>PERSISTANCE PAYS OFF</strong></p><p>After ten years of tenacious persistence, never taking “no” for an answer, and following his passion against all odds (including better financial judgment), Michael finally achieved his dream by executive producing the 1989 film <i>Batman</i> starring Michael Keaton as “Batman” and Jack Nicholson as “The Joker,” which was directed by young auteur Tim Burton. </p><p>The wild success of that film proved what Michael knew all along – that the world needs superheroes – real superheroes with inner emotional lives and complicated backstories – superheroes who are more like real people – superheroes who fans can connect to. Despite all the obstacles Michael experienced in pursuing his dream, he helped create one of the most iconic and successful pop culture franchises of all time.</p><p>This is the story of that boy. The boy who never gave up. The boy who saved his superhero. <i>The boy who loved Batman</i>.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LUg-7zDWHo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622405809/hy1rmrn8bby7ok4toast.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our society has been through a rough time, and now, more than ever, the world needs inspiration and hope through positive, uplifting stories. Michael’s memoir <i>The Boy Who Loved Batman</i> is the inspirational story that we need, that encourages people from all walks of life and of all ages to dream – and to dream big. This is the story about following your passion no matter the roadblocks, and to keep the faith while facing impossible odds. </p><p><i>The Boy Who Loved Batman</i> is a story about changing the world for the better – one comic book nerd at a time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622405824/mjmfg4zxryvzowkwwvsm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Hearing Michael Uslan tell his story in person – with all the trials and tribulations he experienced over decades of struggling to make his dreams come true – is a rare privilege.</p><p>He takes the listener on an emotional journey reminding us all what it means to dream, to struggle, to achieve. We want to give an audience the opportunity to feel the same energy and experience the excitement of his journey from comic book nerd to Executive Producer of one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Indeed, the Batman movies blazed the way for the entire phalanx of comic book-based films. Telling his story in a theatrical setting via a one-man stage play based on Michael Uslan's memoir is an amazing opportunity to bring some inspiration and uplift to the world. After all, theatre as an art-form allows young dreamers to follow their hearts. Don’t we owe it to them to bring them a story celebrating all the sacrifices they make to follow their dreams?</p><p><strong>BUT… PANDEMIC?</strong></p><p>While the COVID-19 pandemic crippled live theatre in 2020, Broadway announced it's reopening in September 2021, bringing performers and audiences back to Broadway for the first time in eighteen months. This will be an exciting revival of an entire industry, and our play about a dreamer who wouldn't say no mirrors what has happened to Broadway as an industry and to its artists. Being a part of this revival would not only be exciting, but would offer <i>The Boy Who Loved Batman </i>a unique launch pad as it takes off in this new form. </p><p><i>The Boy Who Loved Batman</i> is also uniquely positioned as a COVID-19 friendly show. First, it’s a one-man stage play, which minimizes the need for a packed house to sustain its budget. Second, one-man plays, by definition, have minimal crew and only one actor, so any current social distancing rules can be followed for the protection of all talent and behind-the-scenes crew. This also means that the show can be written, rehearsed, directed and previewed safely, with minimized fear of pandemic-related repercussions. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622405843/bnint1xqtgebuqbygcd0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Backing this project means joining Legion M behind the scenes as an amazing team of seasoned Broadway professionals develops the book into a live stage play, including:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622405858/obkmpo3yf4oki3poh0iu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Bob Nederlander and Nederlander Worldwide Productions, LLC</strong></p><p>Robert Nederlander, Jr. is the president and CEO of Nederlander Worldwide Entertainment, part of the Nederlander family of companies which has been in the live entertainment business for over 109 years.

Growing up outside Asbury Park, New Jersey, Michael Uslan was obsessed with comic books. He'd be the first to grab the latest issues off the shelves from his local comic book store, including four copies of the now legendary Fantastic Four #1. His favorite superhero was the brooding, crime-fighting vigilante, Batman. Despising the campy 1960s TV show, Uslan became determined to bring the real Batman—dark, serious, burdened by a tragic past—to the silver screen. Undeterred by Hollywood's initial lackluster response, after a ten-year human endurance contest in which every major movie studio turned him down, Uslan went on to become Executive Producer on every modern Batman film, beginning with Tim Burton's widely hailed <i>Batman</i> in 1989 to Christopher Nolan's celebrated <i>Dark Knight</i> trilogy and well beyond. Warmly told and inspiring, Uslan's remarkable story is a testament both to the profound imaginative power of comic book heroes and the tenacity of the New Jersey boy determined to bring one of them to life. This second edition includes a special foreword and afterword by Uslan, bringing us up to date on everything Batman.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622578593/kaazwofqw7sebkjmwoi6.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>BWLB art print postcards (x4)</strong></p><p>You will receive four postcards, each featuring the art created by our talented artists based on their interpretation of Michael Uslan's story.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624469809/tjusw8fjc1b8fqtv01jz.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>BWLB Alt Mini Posters (x3)</strong></p><p>You will receive the other 3 art prints by all of our extremely talented artists based on their interpretation of Michael Uslan's story full of inspiration and courage.

Only a small percentage of plays developed for Broadway actually make it, and this play will be no exception. That’s why we’re stacking the team behind the project with superhero level individuals working tirelessly to do everything in their power to realize our collective dream. And while we cannot guarantee that the play will ultimately be mounted, all IndieGoGo perks outside of access to play tickets will be fulfilled.</p><p>Dare to dream… and join us in this journey to Broadway!</p></div>","How far would you go to make your dreams come true?Based on Michael Uslan’s memoir The Boy Who Loved Batman, Legion M (Associate Producer) is uniting fans to come along for the ride as we work with Nederlander Worldwide Productions on this new one-man stage play based on Michael’s struggles as a blue-collar, nerdy, comic book-loving kid who would someday grow up to acquire the rights to Batman and become one of the most important behind-the-scenes figures in comic book movie history. His wildly inspiring story will delight, entertain, and leave you feeling like you can accomplish ANYTHING.The team behind the play is led by the world-famous Broadway organization Nederlander Worldwide Productions (part of a family organization that has presented some of Broadway’s most successful shows including Hamilton, Wicked and The Lion King), and they are inviting YOU to participate in behind-the-scenes, exclusive, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities as we follow the journey from concept to stage.  As a “founding fan”, all backers participating in this promotional campaign will receive a photomosaic wallpaper that includes YOUR image commemorating a desire to follow your own dreams and inspire others, along with a special thanks on the play’s website! From there, the perks get even more amazing and other options available include:

EXTRA, EXTRA! The Los Angeles Reading has been confirmed for July 19th at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Check out the tickets and the perks that come with them in the Sidekick Package for the LA Reading. Update: Exciting news for the LA Reading! Deborah Ann Woll will be joining the cast for this unique event in the Stage Directions role. We are thrilled to have her aboard!The boy is Michael Uslan, who grew up in New Jersey at a time when comics were for little kids and parents thought reading them would rot your brain. But Michael absolutely loved comic books… they were his refuge from bullies and irate baseball coaches. In fact, he loved them so much, he had thousands stacked in his dad’s garage, and he knew all the stories by heart.Michael’s passion for comics led to a unique dream… not dreaming of BEING a superhero like many boys his age, but of something a little more unusual… he dreamed of SAVING his superhero. Devastated by how his “dark knight” was portrayed as a campy joke in the 1960’s television series, Michael made a solemn vow to find a way to show the world the “true” Batman – the dark and serious avenger portrayed in the early comic books. This vow became Michael’s life’s work – and despite all obstacles – including being a nobody with no connections to Hollywood or to the comic book industry – Michael believed in his heart of hearts that he would be the guy to bring the world’s first “serious” superhero movie to the silver screen – and when he did it, the movie would be starring his favorite caped crusader.DUH, THAT SOUNDS OBVIOUSWell, back in the 1970s and 1980s, this idea was not obvious at all. In fact, no one had ever done a serious comic book feature film before. The thing you have to understand is that back then, comics were not the super-cool billion dollar franchises that they are today. The Batman TV series was pure camp, and even the Superman movies lacked the dark nuances of the more complicated – and perhaps more compelling – superheroes of today. In fact, no one had ever done a “serious” comic book movie before. So when Michael finally obtained the rights to Batman, Hollywood executives simply didn’t believe there was an audience for his vision.  Every single studio turned him down.PERSISTANCE PAYS OFFAfter ten years of tenacious persistence, never taking “no” for an answer, and following his passion against all odds (including better financial judgment), Michael finally achieved his dream by executive producing the 1989 film Batman starring Michael Keaton as “Batman” and Jack Nicholson as “The Joker,” which was directed by young auteur Tim Burton. The wild success of that film proved what Michael knew all along – that the world needs superheroes – real superheroes with inner emotional lives and complicated backstories – superheroes who are more like real people – superheroes who fans can connect to. Despite all the obstacles Michael experienced in pursuing his dream, he helped create one of the most iconic and successful pop culture franchises of all time.This is the story of that boy. The boy who never gave up. The boy who saved his superhero. The boy who loved Batman. Our society has been through a rough time, and now, more than ever, the world needs inspiration and hope through positive, uplifting stories. Michael’s memoir The Boy Who Loved Batman is the inspirational story that we need, that encourages people from all walks of life and of all ages to dream – and to dream big. This is the story about following your passion no matter the roadblocks, and to keep the faith while facing impossible odds. The Boy Who Loved Batman is a story about changing the world for the better – one comic book nerd at a time.Hearing Michael Uslan tell his story in person – with all the trials and tribulations he experienced over decades of struggling to make his dreams come true – is a rare privilege.He takes the listener on an emotional journey reminding us all what it means to dream, to struggle, to achieve. We want to give an audience the opportunity to feel the same energy and experience the excitement of his journey from comic book nerd to Executive Producer of one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Indeed, the Batman movies blazed the way for the entire phalanx of comic book-based films. Telling his story in a theatrical setting via a one-man stage play based on Michael Uslan's memoir is an amazing opportunity to bring some inspiration and uplift to the world. After all, theatre as an art-form allows young dreamers to follow their hearts. Don’t we owe it to them to bring them a story celebrating all the sacrifices they make to follow their dreams?BUT… PANDEMIC?While the COVID-19 pandemic crippled live theatre in 2020, Broadway announced it's reopening in September 2021, bringing performers and audiences back to Broadway for the first time in eighteen months. This will be an exciting revival of an entire industry, and our play about a dreamer who wouldn't say no mirrors what has happened to Broadway as an industry and to its artists. Being a part of this revival would not only be exciting, but would offer The Boy Who Loved Batman a unique launch pad as it takes off in this new form. The Boy Who Loved Batman is also uniquely positioned as a COVID-19 friendly show. First, it’s a one-man stage play, which minimizes the need for a packed house to sustain its budget. Second, one-man plays, by definition, have minimal crew and only one actor, so any current social distancing rules can be followed for the protection of all talent and behind-the-scenes crew. This also means that the show can be written, rehearsed, directed and previewed safely, with minimized fear of pandemic-related repercussions. Backing this project means joining Legion M behind the scenes as an amazing team of seasoned Broadway professionals develops the book into a live stage play, including:Bob Nederlander and Nederlander Worldwide Productions, LLCRobert Nederlander, Jr. is the president and CEO of Nederlander Worldwide Entertainment, part of the Nederlander family of companies which has been in the live entertainment business for over 109 years.

Growing up outside Asbury Park, New Jersey, Michael Uslan was obsessed with comic books. He'd be the first to grab the latest issues off the shelves from his local comic book store, including four copies of the now legendary Fantastic Four #1. His favorite superhero was the brooding, crime-fighting vigilante, Batman. Despising the campy 1960s TV show, Uslan became determined to bring the real Batman—dark, serious, burdened by a tragic past—to the silver screen. Undeterred by Hollywood's initial lackluster response, after a ten-year human endurance contest in which every major movie studio turned him down, Uslan went on to become Executive Producer on every modern Batman film, beginning with Tim Burton's widely hailed Batman in 1989 to Christopher Nolan's celebrated Dark Knight trilogy and well beyond. Warmly told and inspiring, Uslan's remarkable story is a testament both to the profound imaginative power of comic book heroes and the tenacity of the New Jersey boy determined to bring one of them to life. This second edition includes a special foreword and afterword by Uslan, bringing us up to date on everything Batman.BWLB art print postcards (x4)You will receive four postcards, each featuring the art created by our talented artists based on their interpretation of Michael Uslan's story.BWLB Alt Mini Posters (x3)You will receive the other 3 art prints by all of our extremely talented artists based on their interpretation of Michael Uslan's story full of inspiration and courage.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In early May of 2020, after two months of quarantine and the announcement of the indefinite closure of New York City's Broadway theatres, video essayist Kyle Kallgren decided that he had had enough.</p>
<p>Honestly, he'd missed participating in theatre for a long while, but this assault on one of his (and the world's) most beloved institutions was a breaking point. He reached out to see who among his friends would be interested in joining an endeavor to start making theatre in the present, the ""new normal,"" where traditional physical theatre wasn't coming back for a while. Standouts among his enthusiastic and capable respondents were David Kowarsky and Ilana Greenberg-Sud, who signed on as producers for the first project.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
In early May of 2020, after two months of quarantine and the announcement of the indefinite closure of New York City's Broadway theatres, video essayist Kyle Kallgren decided that he had had enough.
Honestly, he'd missed participating in theatre for a long while, but this assault on one of his (and the world's) most beloved institutions was a breaking point. He reached out to see who among his friends would be interested in joining an endeavor to start making theatre in the present, the ""new normal,"" where traditional physical theatre wasn't coming back for a while. Standouts among his enthusiastic and capable respondents were David Kowarsky and Ilana Greenberg-Sud, who signed on as producers for the first project.
Inspired by the rise of authoritarian leaders at home and abroad, the initial plan was to produce a version of Alfred Jarry's proto-absurdist King Ubu, as a re-affirmation of the necessary role of theatre as social commentary. Then, after the death of George Floyd on May 25th, the world grew a little darker and less stable. Protests, and the reactions thereto, began to escalate in intensity and dominate the news that was not about COVID-19. We realized that we needed to emphasize different goals of theatre -- we needed to bring people together, and drive us towards a better world. 
We pivoted to produce Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, on Midsummer, something a bit more uplifting and accessible, and we decided to organize the performance as a fundraiser for bail and mutual aid funds. 
With just a few weeks of lead time, we peaked at over 300 simultaneous viewers. The stream has since garnered over 7000 views (at the time of writing this), and our viewers donated over $5,000 to the cause.
We want to bring actors, writers, directors, and other artists together to continue to our work in preserving and innovating the institution of theatre. We want to make social justice part of our mission as a theatre company. We want to keep learning and growing.
And we need your help.
