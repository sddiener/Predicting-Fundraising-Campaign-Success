Why We're Doing This
With the exception of some neighborhoods in the capital city of Conakry, most of Guinea is without electricity. 
For light, families turn to kerosene lamps, candles, and open campfires.  These energy sources emit flames that often cause fires, and emit an acrid smoke that burns the eyes and irritates the throat.  Some studies liken the long-term damage caused by daily use of kerosene lamps to that of smoking two packs of cigarettes per day.  
Additionally, it’s expensive, and not sustainable.  
The majority of Guineans live on less than $2 per day through blue-collar employment, like farming, construction and mining.  For this reason, renewable energy sources like solar panels are financially out of reach to most Guineans.  Our goal is to make solar power accessible to ALL Guinean households, not just to the country’s top earners.   The Solution  
When families replace kerosene and candles with solar lights, they experience twice the available hours for studying, cooking, reading and working, as well as significantly better air quality.   The chance of a house fire decreases exponentially and families are left with cleaner, brighter light in which they can work and play together in safety.

<h2>BRIEF SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Are you ready to rethink the way our society deals with plastics - a material made forever, yet we use it only for minutes in over 40% of cases. With the Traveling Trash Tour, we want to explore ways to change this plastic paradox and counter the current exponential growth in global plastic production. We'll <strong>cycle</strong> <strong>1500km through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany</strong> with a giant <strong>plastic waste sculpture</strong> and hold <strong>dozens of events</strong> with local changemakers that show how the circular economy, smart recycling, waste reduction strategies and plastic alternatives can help us save the planet and our own health before it's too late. In order to do this, we need your help to cover our expenses and maximize our outreach! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY WOULD WE DO SOMETHING THIS CRAZY?</h2>
</div><div>
<p>We currently produce roughly as much plastic per year as the entirety of humanity weights - around <strong>300 billion metric tons</strong> - and as of now, 9% of that amount is recycled, 12% incinerated and the rest ends up in landfill or the natural environment. Almost <strong>half of our plastic production is for single-use products</strong> and packaging, used just once and then discarded - but plastic is made to last forever and almost every item made still exists in one or another form. By now, microplastics are already entering our bodies through the food, water and air we breathe, they are present in virtually every part of the natural world - and yet our <strong>production is growing at exponential pace</strong> and society is becoming more disposable every year. This is what I call the <strong>plastic paradox</strong> - and it’s the reason why the Traveling Trash Tour was born: To rethink plastics in Europe!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THREE BIG GOALS</h2>
<ol>
<li>We want to <strong>reach 1 million people</strong> - online and offline - and make them reconsider their daily use of plastic. </li>
<li>We <strong>provide a forum of exchange</strong> for everyone actively changing European plastic production, consumption and circulation.</li>
<li>We <strong>create a lasting portfolio of initiatives, companies and trash heroes</strong> that can become your go-to source of inspiration and best practice in the transition to the circular economy and a low-waste society.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2>HOW CAN YOU TAKE PART? </h2>
<p>The Traveling Trash Tour was created to be as open as possible: Come and <strong>cycle with us</strong> for as long as you want and join our <strong>events in your city</strong>! We’d love to see you there to learn, engage and get active for a more circular economy in Europe and a better future of plastics! And of course, we will let you take part digitally with <strong>videos, stories, livestreams, articles and more</strong>, don't you worry. Come on and become a trash hero by contributing to our campaign and <strong>sharing our story</strong> with your friends! </p>
<p>If you have an initiative of your own, work for a circular company or are part of a citizen movement reshaping plastics and would like to <strong>collaborate</strong> <strong>with us</strong>, or would like to <b>talk on the press/media</b> about this, please get in touch!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT DO WE NEED YOUR MONEY FOR? </h2>
<p>As the founder, I have so far invested incredibly much time and personal savings to prepare the tour and make it a reality - but now we <strong>need your help to realise the tour </strong>and cover expenses on the road! As we want to be <strong>as transparent as possible</strong> with you, here’s a rough budget:</p>
<p>1300€ for bike and equipment (like lights, bags, camping stuff and more - you can donate this in kind, or lend it, too!)</p>
<p>500€ for tech equipment (we want to keep you permanently up to date through stories, photos, videos and more!) </p>
<p>1200€ For 60 days of food (think about it: 58 days of tour + 1 pre and 1 after; no real possibility for cooking, so calculating 20€ per day)</p>
<p>100€ for transport to the starting point and back home to Munich (car sharing or busses, no flights of course!)</p>
<p>300€ for emergency accommodation when there is no friend, friendly host, warm shower or couch-surfing available </p>
<p>350€ for bike repairs, flat tires, or other unforeseen breakdowns (you know these are inevitable!)</p>
<p>350€ for printing material like flyers, event banners, stickers etc. (this is for our events and to spread the word and make this campaign as big as possible - everything printed sustainably of course!)</p>
<p>500€ for machines and material to build the plastic elephant &amp; trailer (let’s make sure this statue survives rainy weather, bumpy roads and windy days)</p>
<p>400€ approx. fees for transactions and the crowdfunding platform (5% for the platform + 3% transaction fees + 30 additional cents per transaction, you can find this in the guidelines)</p>
<p>Yes, you counted correctly: this makes 5000€ of total budget for our two month journey!</p>

<h3>The Soil Not Oil Coalition</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Biosafety Alliance/Soil Not Oil Coalition has been organizing annual conferences and launching campaigns of <strong>great social impact for over 10 years.</strong> </li>
<li>This year, San Francisco is hosting the Global Climate Action Summit, a gathering of global leaders and corporations discussing ways to profit from advanced technological climate change ""solutions."" There will be thousands of policy makers, scientists, farmers and environmental activists participating in the summit and in counter-actions. This is the perfect opportunity host the Soil Not Oil conference in the city where we live and organize, to <strong>promote applicable and practical solutions to climate change</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We need to raise $20K to cover costs.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The rents in San Francisco are very high. We have reserved several spaces including the Grey Area/Grand Theater and the Women's Building, and are working on securing a kitchen.</li>
<li>We need funds for promotion and travel expenses. Basically, <strong>we will need your help</strong> to make the conference happen. </li>
<li>
<strong>Speakers donate their time</strong> to participate in this conference and for this we are very grateful.</li>
<li>Every year, many tickets are distributed to volunteers and <strong>people of color and low-income people at no-cost</strong>, your donations make this possible.</li>
<li>As in previous years, we are planning to serve <strong>free, healthy, non-gmo meals</strong> and snacks to all attendees.</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach the $20K, all funds raised will still go directly to the project and every contribution will encourage other individuals to help sponsor the conference.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are expecting to host this year the largest ever Soil Not Oil International Conference.</p>
<ul>
<li>This year the Soil Not Oil Conference will take place September 9-11, 2018 and will showcase <strong>agro-ecological practices</strong>—regenerative agriculture, no-till/bio-intensive farming, permaculture solutions.  We will feature <strong>community powered solutions</strong> that people in the global south have creatively implemented to adapt and <strong>prevent the ecological and social impacts of climate change.</strong>

The Biosafety Alliance/Soil Not Oil Coalition has been organizing annual conferences and launching campaigns of great social impact for over 10 years. 
This year, San Francisco is hosting the Global Climate Action Summit, a gathering of global leaders and corporations discussing ways to profit from advanced technological climate change ""solutions."" There will be thousands of policy makers, scientists, farmers and environmental activists participating in the summit and in counter-actions. This is the perfect opportunity host the Soil Not Oil conference in the city where we live and organize, to promote applicable and practical solutions to climate change.


We need to raise $20K to cover costs.

The rents in San Francisco are very high. We have reserved several spaces including the Grey Area/Grand Theater and the Women's Building, and are working on securing a kitchen.
We need funds for promotion and travel expenses. Basically, we will need your help to make the conference happen. 

Speakers donate their time to participate in this conference and for this we are very grateful.
Every year, many tickets are distributed to volunteers and people of color and low-income people at no-cost, your donations make this possible.
As in previous years, we are planning to serve free, healthy, non-gmo meals and snacks to all attendees.
Even if we don't reach the $20K, all funds raised will still go directly to the project and every contribution will encourage other individuals to help sponsor the conference.


The Impact
We are expecting to host this year the largest ever Soil Not Oil International Conference.

This year the Soil Not Oil Conference will take place September 9-11, 2018 and will showcase agro-ecological practices—regenerative agriculture, no-till/bio-intensive farming, permaculture solutions.  We will feature community powered solutions that people in the global south have creatively implemented to adapt and prevent the ecological and social impacts of climate change.

People from around the world have attended the conferences, and gone on to implement what they learned in their communities. Many connections have been forged and steps taken for a better future for us all. 
Past conferences have featured international scientists, farmers, elected officials and environmental activists including: Dr. Vandana Shiva, Dr. Rattan Lal, Andrew Kimbrell, Wenonah Hauter, Miguel Altieri, David Zuckerman, Adelita San Vicente Tello, Wenonah LaDuke, Starhawk, John Jeavons, Tim LaSalle, Penny Livingston, Paul and Elizabeth Kaiser, and hundreds more.
The conference encourages local investing to grow our community capacities and enable local development. We highlight the traditional knowledge of indigenous people and we honor the borderless collaboration among organizations led by women, caretakers of the land, elderly, youth and others, who are rarely appropriately represented. This year our goal is to provide a platform in which the voiceless can speak on behalf of their communities in live-streamed presentations.
Presentations will be recorded and available online to further spread this critical information, many with Spanish translation. 
We make this conference accessible to all ages, socioeconomic classes, genders, ethnicities through diverse speakers, reasonable ticket prices and discounted tickets.

and hike in what’s left of our pristine Forests?</p>
<p>Do you want to do something about
Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss, and prevent the CURRENT extinction of flora,
fauna and animals? <br/>
<br/>
I do too and that is why I was inspired to make this film. To raise awareness about the origins
and causes of biodiversity loss, and what we can do to reverse the destructive
trends we currently practice around the world. <b>It is not
too late, but we must act now.</b> If you also care, then consider
helping me spread the message. </p>
<p>The purpose of this Indiegogo
campaign is to raise funds to<b> purchase the video footage</b> used in Heaven's
Falling. This project has been 13 years in the making. I first wrote the
song <i>Heaven's Falling</i> when I lived in
China in 2002 and witnessed, firsthand, the horrible effects of deforestation. I
officially recorded the song in 2013 and have been working on the video ever since. In addition to writing and performing the soundtrack song, I also handpicked
the footage from Pond5 (an online marketplace
for stock footage and photos) and edited the film that you are about to see. </p>
<p>I am seeking financial support for
this campaign so I can publish the video and get the message out there, but <b>I
NEED YOUR HELP TO DO IT. </b> My hope for this video is that it reaches
people around the world (through film festivals and the internet) and inspires
those who see it to do more. To take action. To change how they interact with
this world. It starts with them seeing what we have to lose through this video.
There is so much natural beauty on this earth, but we take it for granted. It
will be too late before we notice it’s gone. <b>WE NEED BIODIVERSITY </b>in
order to survive.  My next target is the Global Climate Sumit happening in Paris, in November of this year.  If I can complete the film in time, then I will personally email it to every leader representing each country that plans on attending the summit.  Perhaps it will help to remind them of the job they need to do in order to protect the world from Climate change.<br/></p>
<p>I also wanted to stand behind an
organization that was working on improving the environment and was inspired to produce
Heaven's Falling for an organization called Voices for Biodiversity (V4B) as a “citizen
Eco-reporter.” Voices for Biodiversity is 100 percent volunteer run, and
operates as an online platform to give a voice to people who care about
biodiversity, the environment, and the creatures that inhabit this world WITH
US. This video is my contribution to V4B’s cause and mission.</p>
<p>We need to get the word out that
there. There is no time to lose. It will take a lot of work if we are going to
save this planet and ourselves, but it starts with YOU. Start now. Consider contributing
towards the purchase of the <b>video footage that you see </b><span>so that the film can be shared<b>. Together
we can spread the message and <b>TAKE ACTION!</b></b></span></p><b>What <span>Is Needed &amp; What You
Get</span></b>
<p>The cost for the footage is $3000.
Please view the GALLERY tab in order to see how much each shot costs; there are
52 shots in total. If you contribute to the film, not only will you receive
MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE but for $50 you will receive a DIGITAL COPY of the song
HEAVEN'S FALLING.  If you contribute $100 you will receive a DIGITAL COPY
of the SONG as well as an EXECUTIVE PRODUCER CREDIT at the end of the film,
which <b>automatically ADDS YOUR VOICE, showing that you also care about what is
happening and that you want to do something about it.  </b></p>
<p>For the fundraising campaign: if I don't
reach my goal, the funds that are raised will still go towards whatever footage
I can purchase. Then if I need to, I plan on having a viewing/fundraising party
in the Fall to finish it off. If you contribute to the film through Indiegogo,
you of course are invited to the viewing party as well!</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>In 2012 I successfully fundraised
funds to finish my full-length feature documentary film <i>Broken Hearts &amp; Butterflie</i>s (on Vimeo). That film touches
hearts in ways that I cannot even comprehend. I know that HEAVEN'S FALLING will
have a similar impact. <b>It is a message that needs to be heard and be seen.<i>
I cannot emphasize enough how valuable your contribution will be in supporting
this passion and project of mine and how important it is for me to finish it. </i></b>There are some days that are better than others, but nothing will stop me
from getting it done, even if I have to purchase one shot a month myself for 52
months!  I will do it!</p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you are unable to financially
support this particular film, <b><i>you can still help out by spreading the
word about this Indiegogo campaign.</i></b>  Post it on your social network
sites like Facebook and Twitter. Explain to people why you care about this
issue. At the end of the film, <b>there is a list of things that we can all do
(big and small) to make a difference.</b> How many of those things do you
currently do? I am always evaluating how my daily living habits affect the

We’re Gemma and Swati and we founded the 2041 Antarctic Youth Ambassador Programme (AYAP).  We’re taking 30 young people to the frozen continent in February-March 2013 to inspire and engage them in the protection of the Antarctic and the larger battle against climate change.</p>
<p><strong>This is our story. </strong></p>
<p>Gemma’s feet are aching as she writes this because she has just returned from a three week walk in the desert in South Australia, walking to show the Australian government that a community once controlled by coal is ready to build Australia’s first solar power plant. For the last three years she has been leading grassroots climate campaigns and youth education programmes in Australia with the Australian Youth Climate Coalition as their fundraising director and campaigner. <br/><br/> Swati’s lifelong dream is to see an orca. As the Assistant Editor of Sanctuary Asia, a wildlife magazine in India, she has been working on conservation issues for the last four years. She has helped organise national and international youth summits on climate change and is passionate about working with young people to involve them in environmental issues.</p>
<p>Our friendship started when we met aboard the 2011 International Antarctic Expedition with polar explorer Robert Swan and his organisation 2041.</p>
<p>Being in Antarctica is incredibly moving. We saw, firsthand, the impacts of climate change on the uninhabited continent and realised that we needed more young people to have the same experience. Antarctica contains 70 per cent of the world’s fresh water and 90 per cent of the world’s ice. Protecting the continent is vital to the water security of the world. In an era of climate change, unprecedented glacial melt in the Antarctic will cause a considerable rise in sea levels worldwide.<br/>  The continent has no people so it needs to be represented by the generation which stands to lose the most from the impacts of climate change.  </p>
<p><strong>About our programme</strong></p>
<p>Recognising the need to focus on local sustainability issues, we designed the 2041 Antarctic Youth Ambassador Programme – a comprehensive climate leadership[ training that will enable our participants to initiate on ground projects when they return. We spoke with 2041 and they loved our idea and agreed to let us pilot the program in February-March 2013. </p>
<p><strong>About 2041 and Robert Swan</strong></p>
<p>Swan is the first person to walk to both the North and the South Pole. He set up 2041, an organisation committed to educating people about the importance of Antarctica.</p>
<p>In 1996 Robert Swan took 35 young people to Antarctica to educate them on the Antarctica and to clean up an old site at Bellingshausen which you can read about here - <a href=""http://www.esaa.org/files/ESAAAntarcticaSiteReport.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.esaa.org/files/ESAAAntarcticaSiteReport.pdf</a></p>
<p>In 2008, he set up the first renewable energy education base in the world on Bellingshausen Island in Antarctica. Run entirely on renewable energy, in the coldest, windiest, driest continent on earth, the e-base is a powerful symbol of what we can achieve if we are committed to a clean energy future.  If it can be done in Antarctica, it can be done anywhere. <a href=""http://www.esaa.org/files/ESAAAntarcticaSiteReport.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/></a></p>
<p><strong>How we will use your contribution</strong> <br/><br/> By contributing to this program you will allow us to bring more young people to the Antarctic to join our programme. The cost is massive – 20,000 USD per person not counting their airfare and equipment costs. We’ve been working really hard to find sponsors but we need your help. We’re taking young people from some of the most vulnerable countries in the world – Iraq, Somalia, South Africa, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh – these kids stand to lose the most to climate change and we want to empower them to fight this threat.</p>
<p><strong>You can help us change their lives</strong></p>
<p>Imagine studying by the light of a candle, walking for hours to get water or scrounging for food for your family. This is the reality of young people in developing countries – a situation that will be exacerbated by climate change. This is a reality we are not willing to accept.</p>
<p>If Antarctica is opened up to drilling and mining, the sea level rise from the ice melt will be unprecedented and countries around the world will be submerged.  The need to empower young people to both address local sustainability issues and to lobby for the protection of the Antarctic is immense. This is what we are going to do on AYAP 2013.</p>
<p>The programme we have planned is rigorous and is focussed on equipping our participants with the tools they need to fight for the environment when they return home. We’re working with each of them individually, to develop a project that will benefit their community, city, town or village. They will also be starting an international campaign around the year 2041 to bring the issue global attention. <strong><br/><br/></strong>Even a contribution of a few dollars will help us achieve this and will help transform the lives of some fantastic young people who are very passionate about creating change.</p>
<p><strong>The figures</strong></p>
<p>Our participants will be flying from their hometown to Ushuaia, Argentina on February 28, 2013. We will be there for three days and then we will board a ship to Antarctica. The cost for the ship and their stay in Argentina is 20,000 USD.</p>
<p>It usually costs 22,000 per person but since we are taking young people from around the world, Robert Swan is personally raising 2,000 per participant, making the final cost 20,000 per participant, because he strongly believes they deserve the opportunity and that in inspiring them, we will be able to influence a wider community.  They also need to raise money for their airfare and equipment costs. <br/><br/> Any money you donate will go towards a corpus for AYAP. We will be tracking our participant’s fundraising efforts and will allocate the money towards those who need it the most. We will tell you exactly what it has gone towards. <br/><br/> If we don’t get all the funds we need we will use the money to do the best we can with what we have. But being able to give more incredible young people the chance to have an even more meaningful experience is what we really want.</p>
<p><strong>Join the movement</strong></p>
<div>
<p>We’re building an environmentally friendly time e-capsule filled with e-messages, videos and photographs from you and incorporating it into the 2041 e-base in Antarctica. Then in the year 2041 it will be removed and we will take these messages to the United Nations.</p>

No matter how much money is raised through this campaign, 100% of it will go to ProAves and will solely be used to purchase and protect this area. 
Please donate any sum, large or small, to help the rainforest and preserve the environment for future generations. 


REASONS TO CONTRIBUTE

The region is internationally recognized by over 60 conservation organizations worldwide through the Alliance for Zero Extinction, and is designated as a Biosphere Reserve in Colombia by Unesco.
Only 1/8 of the area is currently under protection by ProAves, but you can prevent future loss of wildlife by giving to the cause so that eventually, the other 7/8 are also protected!
Colombia has 1,870 different bird species alone, more than anywhere else on earth. In an area of Colombia eight times smaller than the USA, 1/5 of all birds species in the world can be found. You can preserve this extraordinary biodiversity through your contributions.

MyFreshLocal.com wants to help bring down the costs of the healthiest freshest food so more people can afford it and it's easier to find and buy.

The Impact
 
Our current food system uses a ton of toxic chemicals, antibiotics, genetically engineered crops and fossil fuels. This way of growing food and distributing it is undermining public health, destroying the environment and increasing the costs of food for families.
 
When you spend one dollar at a big supermarket for food that’s grown far away, 80 cents of that dollar leaves your area. That money goes to industrial agriculture, to corporate executives and to oil companies for transportation fuel. The farmer who grew the food might keep 10 to 15 cents of the dollar.
 
If your dinner has eight ingredients from eight different areas, that food may have traveled thousands of miles, burning oil moving from where it was grown to where you eat it.
 
But when you spend one dollar at a farmers’ market or a locally-sourced restaurant, the money stays in your community. 
 
 
Local food connects us, it builds local economies and it improves our health. But it is currently too expensive and inconvenient, because large food companies control the food system driving small businesses out.
 
But with your help we are going to help change that!!!

<div>
<p>We are the Northwest Atlantic
Marine Alliance (NAMA). We work with community based, family fishermen on policy
and market alternatives that let us have our fish and eat it, too. Why? Because policy decisions that have turned farms into food production machines with grave ecological, health and economic consequences are being mirrored on the marine side. Fishing is being turned into a highly extractive industry with similar consequences as agribusiness had on farming.</p>
<p>We are at a fork in the road: on one hand we can give away our marine fisheries and seafood system to the likes of Tyson, ConAgra, and Monsantos of the world, while on the other hand we can work with small and medium scale, community based fishermen. Knowing what we know about the history of agriculture and the degradation of our land based food system, soil and communities by agribusiness, the choice is pretty clear to us.</p>
<p>That's why we work so hard to connect family farmers and community based fishermen. By
building alliances with family farmers and food justice advocates, our ocean and seafood
production ecosystems can be protected. </p>
<p>We have been partnering with family farm groups
to connect fishermen to farmers, and since 2008 we have been
sending fishermen to Farm Aid to get inspiration and feel the camaraderie so we
can repeat the good stuff on the water and stop the corporate grab at the resources the ocean provides. </p>
<p>This year we are back on the #Road2FarmAid, and this time helping NC
local commercial fishermen go to Raleigh, NC from September 12 - 13, 2014 to
tell how the theft of marine resources by large corporations is destroying fishing
families, fishing villages, public access to local seafood, and the
environment. Whether it's fishing rights, mining rights, drilling rights, or shoreline property rights that are being grabbed, these grabs have serious ecological, social, economic and food access consequences.</p>
<p>NC fishermen will share
that message with an exhibit at the HOMEGROWN Village at Farm Aid,
complimenting the message from family farmers and elevating the contribution of
fishermen as food producers. Our exhibit will be the “Let’s Make a (ocean)
Grab!” modeled after the game show “Let’s Make a Deal” complete with a game show
host, visuals, and “doors” that the contestants can choose to determine what
marine-based public resource they have “grabbed” and what are the
environmental, social and economic consequences of such an action as well as
solutions to fix the problem. We will be partnering with our friends at the
National Family Farm Coalition to create a game that reaches across land and
sea.</p>
<p>Resource grabs are
resulting in the rapid contraction of family fishing operations as access to the
rights to fish, ocean environment, marine resources and waterfront properties
are restricted or allocated to large corporations and other privileged groups
with the financial and political power to shape policy.  </p>
<p>This will be the sixth year we have facilitated the
participation of fishermen at Farm Aid. For the first four years, we shared an
exhibit space with our friends at the National Family Farm Coalition. In 2013
we had our own Homegrown Village space for the first time with the successful
game of “The Price is Wrong!” highlighting the economic injustice of our food
system particularly for fishermen and farmers.<br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>Help Us Get Fishermen To Farm Aid</h3>
<div>We need your help to get 12 fishermen and community-based fishing advocates to Farm Aid to share their
message with the public, with the media, and with farm and food organizations.  Fishermen will be sacrificing time away from
work to attend – if the fish are running that week, that could be a significant
donation. So we want to raise $2,500 to cover the cost of lodging, travel and
tickets for 12 fishing community volunteers as well as the cost of creating our
exhibit at Farm Aid’s Homegrown Village.<br/>
</div>
<div>You  may be thinking: why can't they pay their own way to go? Truth is that many small and medium scale fishermen are walking a thin line between profitability and loss. With privatization of fisheries, many are now having to pay to lease the rights to fish and the price at the dock is often not enough to cover all the costs. We call this fishing in the red, and it was the basis of our game in 2013's Farm Aid. With such low - or even non-existence - profit margins, it's faith and commitment that makes them go out everyday. And they are often too proud to ask for help. We want to remove the money barrier from their decisions because we know when fishermen get to places like Farm Aid they are inspired to keep going. So we want to make sure they get there.</div>
<div>
<p>Last year, it cost us almost $2,000 to send 10 people to Farm
Aid in Saratoga Springs, NY. If we don’t raise all the money we estimate we
need, we’ll put whatever we raise toward getting fishermen to Farm Aid. And
should we raise more than $2,500 – which we hope we do – we will put it toward
next year’s Fishermen to Farm Aid plans.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>What Can We Accomplish Together?</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Family fishermen need to know we care about who catches our
fish. Your support sends them the message that collectively we believe there is
a difference between fishing and extracting seafood. Being at Farm Aid is an
uplifting experience for all of us, and just being there has energized us to
keep fighting for a healthy ocean and healthy fishing communities.</p>
<p>If our presence during the 2013 Farm Aid Homegrown Village is
any indication, we’ll reach tens of thousands of concert-goers and the media.
Last year, we created “The Price is Wrong” game to highlight the lack of fair
price for fishermen and farmers - what we call fishing and farming in the red. Based on the concertgoers reception to that
game, we know they engage with our new “Let’s Make a (Ocean) Grab” game and
will learn about ways public policy can advance the cause of community-based
fishing and roll back exorbitant fishing quota and permit leasing costs, the
rapid conversion of working waterfronts to recreational and leisure uses, the
graying of the fleet as fewer young people see a future in fishing, and how the
viability of local fleets and their roles in environmental and cultural
heritage stewardship can be restored.</p>

power with those who are impacted most by our work: community based fishermen
at the forefront of the struggle to save our ocean. We have refused taking
funding from organizations and foundations that dictate how we work and what we

</span>Making it easy for fishermen to attend.
Much like farmers, fishermen are having a harder and harder time making ends
meet. So taking time off from work – in their case fishing – and to pay for
travel, lodging, and other related costs is simply out of the question. But
we’ve been able to demonstrate to them that being at Farm Aid will give them
hope, allies and spiritual uplifting. Knowing this makes it easier for them to
take the day off from work. So we are coming to you to help us with making the rest
of it possible by contributing to the travel, lodging, tickets and materials
costs. </p>
<p>The risk is that some people won’t understand why fishermen are
having a presence at Farm Aid. But that’s a risk we’re willing to take as with
every year we’ve been at Farm Aid we have seen an increase in the knowledge,
interest and participation of those who have come to realize why community
based fishermen and family farmers are important if we are to have our food
with smallest ecological footprints but the biggest social and economic
impacts. </p>

<p>BA is also delighted to partner with Brownsboro farm owners to offer a scenic recreational
opportunity in the outdoors.  Trails are accessible to hikers, walking with or without a dog, and to horseback
riders.  The <span>trail allows BA to preserve land, trees, flowers,
waterbeds, and animal habitats for future generations to enjoy.  Members can enjoy
bird watching, spring wildflower walks, and a rainbow of colors in fall
foliage. Much like nature itself, the picture will change and grow… and the
opportunities are endless. </span></p>

According to the Centers for Disease Control, Kentucky is among the top ten states for obesity rates nationwide.  Our children today are experiencing
chronic illnesses once reserved for adults.  BA is responding to the need for adults,
children, and families to find recreational opportunities and become more active.  The BA trail is an antidote for
growing girths and is a great addition to any fitness regimen.  
BA is also delighted to partner with Brownsboro farm owners to offer a scenic recreational
opportunity in the outdoors.  Trails are accessible to hikers, walking with or without a dog, and to horseback
riders.  The trail allows BA to preserve land, trees, flowers,
waterbeds, and animal habitats for future generations to enjoy.  Members can enjoy
bird watching, spring wildflower walks, and a rainbow of colors in fall
foliage. Much like nature itself, the picture will change and grow… and the
opportunities are endless. 
  Risks & Challenges  Brownsboro Alliance Trail System is organized without government funding, so we rely on the generosity of people like you.  We do not own the land used for this members-only trail system, so many public grants and other scholarship opportunities are not available to us.  
BA has worked with landowners and attorneys to ensure that the trail system and its users are
protected by Kentucky laws.  As we go forward with additional segments, we will work to protect landowners rights as well as the safety of trail members using the trail.
  Other Ways You Can Help Some people can't contribute, but we need more than just financial donations: 
Volunteer your time and talents to work on the trail.

<p>My name is David Bond. I am a (soon to be) 53 year old English teacher living in Brazil and Tapuio is my home. I am an American who sold everything in 2007, left Texas, and moved south, just got on the bus and headed south, until I stopped in Tapuio, a mountainous spot of Atlantic Forest in the southeast state of Espírito Santo. </p>
<p>Tapuio is located in the municipality of Iconha in the state of Espírito Santo in Brazil. It is a zone of mountains suddenly rising 2296 feet up. From the upper reaches of Tapuio, you can look out at approximately 150 miles of Atlantic coastline. Heavily depredated in the past, it was long ago abandoned because of its inaccessibility and today there are no permanent residents. The forest returned, the plants returned, the wildlife returned, and when I first moved there in 2008, ant eaters, foxes, boas, armadillos, monkeys, parakeets, paca, and more were all quite common. Porcupines would walk around and on the house at nights. Orchid spores blew in with the wind, sprouted, grew, bloomed. Vanilla vines and passion fruit vines blanketed the trees. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/182921/files/20131107150440-bird.png?1383865480"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 2009, people in the area began talking about eco-tourism, which for some reason means exactly the opposite around here: bring in as many people as possible, pave roads, cut down trees, get rid of snakes, so that eco-tourists can walk safely all over the place. It didn't really happen, in part because I was ferocious in my opposition, but the damage was done. Massive deforestation. The tourists didn't come (thankfully) but hunters did, in large numbers. They decimated much of the wildlife. Now, fruit falls from the trees and rots on the ground. Bird hunters flocked into the upper reaches to collect birds for the illegal bird trade. Orchids disappeared, bromeliads disappeared. Cattle farming expanded, agriculture expanded, and the area is dying. Local protection groups remain indifferent. Since no politically important people live here or own land here, it isn't politically important to them. </p>
<p>I want to try to save this area from further damage and destruction. I have an overall plan to record the loss, use the images to generate support for this beautiful area, and either acquire the area or find a patron who can. Recording the loss is the first step.</p>
<p>This first step is crucial. Without a recording of what is lost, I cannot convince people of what needs to be saved. Your help will enable me to do this.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/182933/files/20131107150858-orchid.jpg?1383865738"" src="""" style=""width: 280px; height: 210px;""/></p>
<p><b>The Give and Take</b></p>
<p>When I moved into Tapuio in 2008, I had a nice camera and my Mac Book Pro. I took photos constantly, learning photography while preserving the images of Tapuio. In 2009,  five of my photos were used in the exhibit for my region at the 2009 EXPOTUR in Vitória. Through my photography, I was able to generate concern, control hunters, and record the wildlife. Unfortunately, in 2010 my camera was stolen. </p>
<p>I have all my photos saved on my computer; however, early this year my computer suffered damage due to a power surge. Fire came out the power connection and the CD slot. Even though my computer still works, it was badly damaged and now overheats regularly. It has slowed down, is unable to process volumes of information, and I fear I will lose my photos. I can barely work with the photos I saved.</p>
<p>So for this first step, I need a new computer and a new camera. I could do with a few lenses as well, but I that is not necessary. </p>
<p>I don't need a new Mac Book Pro. I don't need to carry my computer out into the field. So I decided on a Mac Mini. It has the computing power I need, is easy enough to move should I need to, and is less expensive. I chose Mac because that is all I've ever used. </p>
<p>For a camera, I have a certain loyalty to Olympus. My stolen camera was an Olympus. It's what I used, what I know. The Olympus E-5.</p>
<p>My goal of $5000 is a little higher than the cost of the two items. The extra money will be applied to the cost of a site I use to write about Tapuio, where I can post the images and write about the what is happening. The site is also a place where I can publicly flesh out details about where I want to take this project long term. The additional money will also allow me to print and produce in tangible fashion my images for display. </p>
<p>If I do not meet my goal, I will apply the money either toward a new computer or a camera, depending on how much is actually raised. If it isn’t sufficient for either, then I will apply it toward printing the images I currently have from 2008-2010, website maintenance, and rent on the space I use for teaching which I can also use as a space for awareness about Tapuio.</p>
<p>For those interested in receiving perks for their contributions, I can offer access to high resolution images of Tapuio (your choice of image) for reproduction, high quality printed images, or t-shirts with images of the leaves of Tapuio. </p>
<p><b>Why do this?</b></p><p>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/182950/files/20131107151323-_71033481111111.jpg?1383866003"" src="""" style=""width: 344.11307420494694px; height: 259px;""/></p>
<p>I’m sure everybody knows about the Brazilian oil discoveries. And with oil comes development, not all of it ecologically sound. Well, that oil is right off the coastof Espírito Santo, right where I live. From my house in Tapuio I can see the gas fires on the platforms 100 kilometers out at sea. Construction is everywhere and everything is tinged with urgency, possibility, greed. Looking out from the top of Iconha all the way to the ocean in all directions all you see are empty brown hills with wandering cattle, construction, and eucalyptus and rubber. The Highway 101 which runs through the center of Iconha is a constant never ending stream of cars and trucks and noise and pollution. Quality has never been considered a lucrative concept in this region: you had to wait too long for the money. So the drive is to construct and create quickly, cheaply, to accommodate as many people as possible in as small an area as possible. </p>
<p>While some regional municipalities are changing their views and incorporating the concept of quality, Iconha is hurtling headlong into quick-and-cheap. The city is a dreary chaos of noise and traffic incessant traffic with the major highway passing right through the middle of the city. Nobody takes advantage of this traffic to create any kind of quality attraction. All Brazil drives through the heart of Iconha yet there is no attempt at capturing that traffic in terms of education, culture, quality business. </p>
<p>The interior of Iconha, on the other hand, is beautiful. Mountains and waterfalls and spectacular views and nature form the backdrop to this horrible little city. Mountains rise up to almost 3000 feet. The Atlantic Ocean is only about 10 miles away and the river that flows down the mountains in Iconha flow into the Atlantic Ocean. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183003/files/20131107153847-330119_10150464274296796_249783437_o.jpg?1383867527"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Five and a half miles from the center of the city and straight up 1000 feet or so is Tapuio, facing the Atlantic Ocean. Long ago abandoned due to difficult access, it was ignored until recently. Because the rain pattern is from West to East, Tapuio is dryer than the same region on the western side of the slopes, creating a different biozone from the surrounding zones and regions. Because the incline is abrupt, not gradual, the climate is also different: summers can be dreadfully hot and dry in a region of summer rains. Winters can be painfully cold even at altitudes as low as 1300 feet, the altitude of my house. Cacao will not produce above this line, coconuts barely grow and never fruit here. My thermometer has recorded winter lows as low as 45ºF and I know it has been colder, something not usual in other areas at the same altitude.  The result of this is a flora and fauna different from the surrounding areas. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183004/files/20131107154016-252498_230860776939596_6257679_n.jpg?1383867616"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is also a zone of transition in terms of human use. For years it suffered from the extraction of granite and marble and during that time many families lived here. That came to an end (the cables and blocks are still strewn about in Tapuio with blocks of granite simply sitting around) and families who had made a living here farming and extracting granite moved away. Abandoned, the forest grew back, animals returned. Some people continued farming, but by and large it was simply ignored. Orchids sprouted on coffee plants. Trees grew up, flowered, seeded, spread feeding a growing population of paca and foxes and ant eaters and bats. Jussara (a kind of açaí), sapucaia (similar to Brazil nuts), avocados, pink pepper and other even more exotic trees and plants, some already rare in other parts of Brazil, were everywhere up here. </p><p>                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/182963/files/20131107151841-lizard.jpg?1383866321"" src="""" style=""width: 388px; height: 291px;""/></p>
<p>Water is spring fed and good, but not plentiful. The few springs feed the two houses still operating in Tapuio as well as many families below. </p>
<p>The area is unique, beautiful, rare. In the past few years due to speculation about tourism, hunting, and expanding agriculture the area has been massively deforested. Large trees are felled every week. Cattle now wander the mountainsides eating everything, resulting in erosion, depletion of the soil, death of the area. The mountain soil is literally washing into the ocean with each rain. The risk of landslides has increased. Dry spells and heat have both increased. And people talk about building tourist condos, cheaply made to accommodate the greatest number of the lowest quality tourist who will use up all the water, leaving the area dead. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/182981/files/20131107152314-fence.jpg?1383866594"" src="""" style=""width: 382.37230769230774px; height: 287px;""/></p>
<p>Animals are disappearing at an alarming rate. Hunting has increased to the point there is no longer anything to hunt. Avocados and passionfruit fall from the trees and rot. I haven’t seen an ant eater in three years. I haven’t seen an irara in two years. The last fox disappeared two years ago. Even the spiders and snakes are disappearing. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183006/files/20131107154154-ara_a_.png?1383867713"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I have a long term plan to try to stop the destruction and reverse the damage, but it is a plan in various steps. My ultimate goal is somehow to acquire (or convince someone else to acquire) the land and convert it into a very restricted retreat, 5 houses at the most to be used for very limited periods of time by a very limited number of people for the purposes of rest, research, and artistic work. This would stop the “development” and completely eliminate hunting and depredation. Their presence could also contribute to a more quality growth in this area: any artistic work could be displayed and/or sold in Iconha, thus capturing some of that heavy traffic that courses through the city every day without stopping. I’m sure you can see how this can spur other forms of quality growth. (For example, there is no decent restaurant in the city. Not one. There are a couple self-service pit stops designed for people to fill their bellies and move on.) </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/183008/files/20131107154237-247562_230861130272894_3643864_n.jpg?1383867757"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I understand. Believe me, I understand. I look at my  bank account and cry! But contributions aren’t only in the form of money. There are a number of things you can do.
• Share Share Share. One of my biggest frustrations on Facebook has been that instead of sharing, people hit like and move on. Nobody else sees it, nobody else knows, nobody else gets involved. Please share. Let people know. 
• Come down for a visit, see for yourself. Spend a week in Tapuio and then go back and talk. Or if you can’t, suggest it to a friend, a college student looking for a research topic, an adventurer looking to go somewhere he wouldn’t otherwise consider. 
• Give me advice, let me know what I can do better. 
I know there are better places, more beautiful places, more interesting places. But Tapuio is my home, it is where I live, and it is beautiful. Help me keep this spot of life alive.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Provide local recycling facilities, promote reduce, repair &amp; reuse ideas AND generate income for local schools.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Us: </strong></p>
<p>Recycle for Education is a joint project with Sven Baumgärtel from Has Den Bosch University Holland, APE (Association for protection of the Environment) and volunteers from Projects Abroad.</p>
<p>Local waste in Khao Nor Chuchi, Thailand is usually burnt or taken to local landfill, government recycling facilities are not available. Many recyclable materials are disposed in this way polluting the environment and increasing demand on natural resources to make new products.</p>
<p>We are working together to increase the accessibility of recycling within the  Khao Nor Chuchi area. </p>
<p>The project we have developed in conjunction with a local school is to set up recycling collection centres at schools in the area. The school will maintain the facilities and in return can use the income from selling recyclables to provide much needed funds to improve educational facilities and develop sustainability projects providing food for student's lunches.</p>
<p>We will have a launch workshop and produce and trial educational materials on environmental issues and waste.</p>
<p>But we don't want to stop there, we know that recycling isn't the best long term solution so we want to promote reduce, repair and reuse. We are going the extra step and are building the recycling centre from old plastic bottles, showcasing a great reuse idea. Lets hope that this creates a few more eco buildings in the area, our test build has certainly generated a lot of local interest!</p>
<p>So it's win, win, win. The environment benefits, reduce, repair, reuse is promoted &amp; showcased and local schools raise money for education and sustainability projects! </p>
<p><strong>Where Will Your Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>This money is to develop all the educational materials and work in a minimum of 2 schools to build a basic recycle collection centre. We will launch the scheme with a workshop and provide 4 follow up lessons per school. We can then analyse the results and improve the system before being ready to roll out to more schools in the region in 'phase 2'. Any money left over will go to setting up the system in more local schools as part of phase 2.</p>
<p>We will...</p>
<p>Develop and produce educational materials (posters, signs, flags etc) for the Reduce, Reuse, Repair &amp; Recycle part of the project.</p>
<p>Buy building materials to make 2 easy to maintain, rainproof recycle centres in local schools, showcasing as many reuse ideas as possible.</p>
<p>Provide a fun Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle workshop to launch the project and 4 follow up lessons per school. </p>
<p>Monitor &amp; develop the facilities and prepare the scheme for phase 2.</p>

Did you know that just this past year the Japanese lost in the International Court of Justice and have been ordered to stop their commercial whaling? This happened because of donations to anti-whaling campaigns like this one.
Without people around the world banding together to support wild animals they face very real threats of pointless killing and even extinction. You can help out though with your donation, even if you can't personally go on this campaign.
Other Ways You Can HelpDon't have money to contribute, no problem you can still help:
If you know someone that might be interested in this campaign just forward this link to them, that'd be really great!
Apparently Indiegogo has some great sharing tools, you can check those out too!
Thanks so much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

When an ex military experimentalist <b>dropped explosives down an artesian spring</b>. This shook the earth and underground oil began to run to the surface. this discovery was the kickstarter to an american oil industry. 'Torpedoes' became a common place method in oil production increasing production 12000%. Titusville will be one of many stops along the long road.<br/><br/> With the recent protests across Canada (and the world) sparked by the peaceful blockade in New Brunswick it is clear we are with the pulse of this struggle against oil and gas industry.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>New Brunswick has seen the damage Fracking can do and has done in BC, to land and its inhabitants alike. That's why the Elsipogtog in Moncton have stood against it.</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Given the immediate and the historic relationship this eastern coast has to Fracking, I think it`s a worthy journey to take in the name of anti-fracking.<br/><br/><b>Fracking and You-<br/></b><br/> In regions plagued by the fracking industry people are feeling repercussions.

<p><span class=""notranlsate""> I grew up in 'British Colombia' surrounded by evergreen trees, arbutus trees, ocean and tons of water.

 With donors support this piece will have an avenue for impact, hopefully to wake up audiences to the urgency needed to put an end to hydraulic fracking in our communities. 
 Water depends on it. Pledgers will facilitate shifts, action & help light the fire. The fire we all need to fight the fight. We need to do this together. 
 Money raised will be used on venues, outreach, promotion, education and the show will ultimately be seen by all at whatever cost. Not looking to preach to the converted, but to really reach those complacent or knowingly or unknowingly ignorant to the issue we wish to reach people of all walks of life, industry professionals to activists. & to perform for communities affected by Fracking directly.
 ---------- given these recent events I think it is pertinent that we explore the United States for answers and experience Since, in the last couple weeks of October in Moncton, New Brunswick a Houston, Texas company SWN got assisted by the RCMP in dispersing indigenous protesters. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police were also assisted by US militants, who were there to protect their investment. The 'protest' was blockading the Houstinites from their Seismicity equipment, they were unable to start their work and losing money every day.... A real skirmish broke out. the first of its kind in a long time. This is why I believe we are with the pulse of the fight------
{ I like to think those american soldiers had as hard a time as i did getting into the others respective country but I think there tactical guns weren't an issue for our border guards. I actually got my hatchet in the US without a problem, I'll certainly need it to chop wood, as winter is inching behind me, nipping at my heels in every moment. }
If you contribute you will receive a signed dvd (break out your dvd players guys-big time) the electric first performance of 'Fresh Water'  It took place in Vancouver BC April 2013 It features writer performers - Chala Hunter & Nathan Barrett -
 We'll reach our entire goal of ten thousand dollars and the funds will go towards this piece...
Why Tour the East Coast ... The first Frack took place in Titusville Florida in 1859. When an ex military experimentalist dropped explosives down an artesian spring. This shook the earth and underground oil began to run to the surface. this discovery was the kickstarter to an american oil industry. 'Torpedoes' became a common place method in oil production increasing production 12000%. Titusville will be one of many stops along the long road. With the recent protests across Canada (and the world) sparked by the peaceful blockade in New Brunswick it is clear we are with the pulse of this struggle against oil and gas industry.
New Brunswick has seen the damage Fracking can do and has done in BC, to land and its inhabitants alike. That's why the Elsipogtog in Moncton have stood against it.
Given the immediate and the historic relationship this eastern coast has to Fracking, I think it`s a worthy journey to take in the name of anti-fracking.Fracking and You- In regions plagued by the fracking industry people are feeling repercussions. Communities living atop of tapped shale deposits or anywhere near active Fracking wells in BC are developing cancers never before diagnosed
 Springs that once produced pristine drinking water for thousands of years are being sealed off to the public because they are now producing tainted water. This is due to the communication between the ground water & shale gas, methane and sometimes even plutonium
this is of course insane. Unacceptable. But it continues.
 Fracking is a provincially and nationally endorsed industry. British Colombia has over 32,000 Fracking wells, almost exclusively up north in indigenous populated areas. The number is continually growing as you read these words.
No surprise BC's Premier Christy Clark supports the 'cutting edge' industry, Prime Minister Stephan Harper supports, and here in the US Barrack Obama does not contest it.
 I grew up in 'British Colombia' surrounded by evergreen trees, arbutus trees, ocean and tons of water. There's an ownership that you inherently feel over a place you grow up in even as a 'settler' which is what I am proud to be. Growing up with access to some of the cleanest municipal drinking water in the world is awesome a blessing. I would like my niece and nephew to share that blessing with me and you. It's pure life, two days without water, you perish.  Its my responsibility as a local human to fight for our water. The only way I know how to is through performance art. It's an form with mortality & it can affect people mortally.  I will dedicate my life to ending this squandering capitalist spineless stupidity that is occurring in our backyards. with your help I can make an impact.

They are trying to transition from subsistence farming of corn and beans to mango trees. Their region of Kenya is semiarid and punctuated with long dry seasons. This makes traditional crops risky to grow as they are 100% dependent of the rains for water. Special varieties of mangos have been breed to resist the dry seasons and represent a unique opportunity for profitable and sustainable farming in this part of Kenya. Unfortunately, mango saplings are prime targets for domesticated animals during the dry season and without a proper fence, the saplings will be destroyed before they can reach maturity (2-3 years).

<p>We're a couple of mid-lifers trying to do something grand before the old folks home claims us. We bought the historic Globe Elevator and started reclaiming its old-growth wood. But we ran into a recession and fell behind in our loan payments. We need to raise $56,000 to stay afloat long enough to find a new owner. Otherwise, the bank will foreclose and a vast amount of beautiful antique wood will go up in smoke - perhaps literally. In return for your contribution, we're offering a small piece of history and the satisfaction of knowing you are helping the planet by reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
<h3><strong>How We Got Here</strong></h3>
<p>The Globe Elevator, on the edge of Lake Superior, was the biggest grain storage facility in the world when it was completed in 1887.  Its three mammoth buildings contained over 6 million board feet of old-growth Eastern White Pine from the area’s virgin forests. The elevator was closed in 1988 and our little company, Wisconsin Woodchuck, began deconstructing it in 2006.</p>
<p>Woodchuck is the offspring of David Hozza, a one-time city planner from St. Paul, and Judy Peres, a retired newspaper reporter from Chicago. They put their life savings into the quixotic project and persuaded friends and family to invest too. Unfortunately, a monster recession intervened, drastically slowing demand for specialty reclaimed wood.</p>
<p>The company’s mortgage lender is now threatening to foreclose, and it’s not likely the bank – or whoever buys the 8-acre property at the sheriff’s sale – is going to care about the lumber, given the difficulty of taking it down. Dave and Judy are trying desperately to save the wood before it gets blown up, chipped up, land-filled, or incinerated. It’s probably too late to save the company or recoup any of our investment. But we still have more than 5 million board feet – the equivalent of about 20,000 trees – of irreplaceable old-growth white pine. We need to get this incredible resource into the hands of someone who can continue the task we started, and that could take more time than we have left.  </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>It takes approximately $9,000 a month to keep the bank at bay. So if we can raise $56,000, we can buy six months. More would be better, but any amount would be valuable.</p>
<p>The money will not be used for regular operating expenses or salaries. It will cover loan payments ($37,830), taxes ($3,250), insurance ($9,306), attorneys’ fees ($3,000), and a publicity campaign ($2,600) to find a buyer who will carry on our mission to save the wood. We’re already getting some important help in that regard: The hit TV series Ax Men is telling our story. You can watch it at 9 p.m. Eastern (8 p.m. Central) Sundays on the HISTORY Channel.    </p>
<p>Everyone who contributes to this campaign will get a piece of the historic Globe Elevator as well as a big wet one from Dave and Judy. If you dig deep, you could get a fine-art print of a photograph or video still taken during the deconstruction project, or the hard hat worn by one of the crew during the filiming of Ax Men. If you dig really deep, you could get a ride in the crane basket and lunch with Mike, our cantankerous construction manager, in beautiful downtown Superior.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t have to be a tree hugger to appreciate the value of preserving a rare resource. Old-growth Eastern White Pine is virtually extinct: The great stands that once covered much of the northeastern United States are gone, and the only way to get it is to reclaim it from an existing structure. The Globe Elevator is the biggest known source of this wood. Simply put, not using it would be a big, fat waste. It’s like your mother said: Eat your dinner, because children somewhere are starving. You’ll feel bad if you waste it. And you won’t get a second chance.</p>
<p>Re-using this wood is good for the end user because it’s beautiful and durable and distinctive and has a great story to tell. But it’s also good for the planet because it reduces harmful greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>Trees remove carbon from the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide, and harvested wood continues to store that carbon. If the wood is burned, or left to decay in a landfill, the carbon is released into the atmosphere. What’s more, green trees will be cut down and processed to replace what’s lost – or builders will use alternative materials with a much bigger carbon footprint. Do you want <em>that</em> on your conscience?</p>

Even the visiting volunteers that work at the project, pay for their stay so that 100% of donations to the charity get planted in the ground. But as Dr Suess say “unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.” With the forest being torn down at a net rate of 9.4 million hectares a year, we need more people working to protect the last standing forests and replenishing those that have been cut down.It’s time for change, it’s time for big change, and the change starts at the Mindfulness Project.What we need1. We need 110.000 EUR to buy a piece of farm land, turn it back into rain forest and subsequently into a nature reserve.2. The figure above also helps to legally fight off an oil company that plans to frack on that land.3. We need 1000 EUR in order to purchase a woodchipper (woodchippers help to revitalise old soil in order to grow plants effectively).4. We need 10.000 EUR to purchase a new pick-up truck for the transport of plants, tools and natural building material.We know we cannot do everything in one day, that’s why we start our first campaign with a smaller target. It’s enough to continue our work in short term.When will we see the difference?We've been working on our project for 5 years now. We're not waiting for donations, we're making progress every day. You can see the difference if you come to visit us, and you can also help us with your voluntary work.You can also follow us on our website: http://charity.mindfulness-project.org/Other Ways You Can HelpSharing this campaign with your friends, family, and networks like Facebook and Twitter is super important - so more people will have the chance to participate!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>After spending some time in Nicaragua and talking with local communities, businesses, and international non-profits and NGOs, it became clear to me that <b><i>there is a great need for both waste reduction and an alternative energy use for cooking and heating other than wood</i></b>.

Today's youth need to be inspired by possibilities and instilled with hope and a sense of adventure. <br/></p><ul><li><h4>We take a holistic approach</h4></li></ul><p>--We're human ecologists which means we focus on relationships between people and our environments.  Our approach is interdisciplinary.  Advanced training in the social sciences of cultural anthropology and psychology gives us deeper understandings of forces which shape collective action, and the importance of self-representation for Indigenous Peoples. </p><ul><li><h4>We engage risk through careful planning and training</h4></li></ul><p>After roughly 15,000 nautical miles at sea and five years of training and volunteer work from the coast of Maine to Dominican Republic, Haiti, Panama, and across the South Pacific Ocean States of French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Tonga, and Fiji, working towards our destination of Vanuatu, we've build a dynamic project that:</p><p>--attests to our resourcefulness and fortitude when encountering adversity.</p><p>--demonstrates creativity, passion and dedication.</p><p>--has been well received in both the US and Vanuatu with new partners, like <b>Mission Blue,</b> coming on board to pitch in.</p><ul><li><h4>We keep you connected!<br/>

email: bsgfarm@peoplepc.com Please reach out with any questions.  Kind regards,   Janis & Brooks           Research Vessel Llyr (""of the sea"")In an era of collapsing biological and cultural diversity, Vanuatu is one of our planet's last great places.  Lying west of Fiji and on the eastern edge of The Coral Sea, this remote archipelago of 83 islands and open ocean is home to a vast treasure trove of biological riches -- from coral reefs to mangrove and rain forests -- and an enduring interdependence between its people and their natural environment.  The archipelago's conservation champions and best hope are the Vanua-tai  (Land & Sea),  a remarkable Indigenous group of 400 environmental stewards crafting local solutions to global crises.  The Vanua-tai have asked Island Reach, a unique, US-based conservation project operating in Vanuatu, to provide a vessel for the Vanua-tai.  Working on board Research Vessel Llyr,
 Island Reach is partnering with them to fill transportation gaps  and provide a mobile work platform, skilled and professional 
services and training, and greater opportunities for collaboration and 
exchange among the Vanua-tai. WE NEED YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN! Although this Indiegogo campaign is closed, our fundraising effort continues independently throughout 2015 and donations can be made to The Ocean Foundation for Friends of Island Reach:http://oceanfdn.org/donate/island-reachThe intimate relationship between Ni-Vanuatu  (the people of Vanuatu) and their lands and seas finds expression in the densest language diversity on the planet, with over 120 languages in active use!  In most of Vanuatu's 1000 villages, there is no electricity, there are no roads, and small boat motors are rare.   Work -- from fishing to forest farming -- is done with skilled hands.  Vanuatu is in a race to protect this rich heritage from the rapidly intensifying effects of climate change, extractive industries such as logging, mining, and foreign fishing fleets, and population shifts.                                                              Children of Futuna  Now, more than ever, there is urgent need for these volunteers to work with their village Chiefs, farmers, fishers, and families to build sustainable solutions.  The  Vanua-tai are eager to engage;  they know what they need: but for many of them, especially those in remote locations, access to resources, training, and opportunities for exchange is insufficient to meet the sheer number of mounting challenges.  As a result, many Vanua-tai are struggling with projects that are stalled or under-developed. Headed offshore to Cook's Reef with Vanua-tai and Emae villagers.  (Aqualung USA snorkel packs donated to Island Reach for distribution in Vanuatu.)What is Island Reach?
Island Reach is a volunteer, ocean-going project in Vanuatu, conceived and built by a New England farming family headed by a couple of social scientists trained in Human Ecology and Cultural Anthropology.  As forest farmers, we've spent many years developing strategies to support small-scale harvesters and we've spoken widely about food, economies, culture, and the environment.  In 2010, with dire reports about the state of the planet and our oceans on the rise, we were compelled to greater action.  Our plan was to target the resource shortages that impede conservation efforts in island and coastal settings.  This was a personal and professional decision that involved mortgaging the farm, purchasing and refitting Research Vessel Llyr, and training as offshore ""bluewater"" mariners.  Harvesting a perennial crop meant that our work schedule could be adjusted so that we could be on the farm for half the year and spend the other half working in a biological and cultural conservation hotspot.Island Reach now operates Research Vessel Llyr and partners with local communities and regional groups in Vanuatu -- a vast archipelago of islands spanning 600 nautical miles -- to build social and environmental resilience from ridge to reef. Island Reach was conceived and built precisely to serve an Indigenous group of conservation stewards like the Vanua-tai.

""Island Reach has supported partners in Vanuatu to
fill critical extension and information gaps in the most remote,
unconnected and vulnerable communities.  The training and capacity
building they have provided with indigenous Networks like the
Nguna-Pele Marine and Land Protected Area Network and Tasi Vanua
Resource Management Network and with individual communities has
contributed to resilience building across the country.  Having PhD
scientists engaging directly with communities is a rare and
invaluable voluntary contribution to the nation of Vanuatu.""

In crisis lies opportunity
 We can all respond and get the Vanua-tai 
conservation champions the core services and resources they need to 
thrive in one of our world's biocultural hotspots;  or... they risk being ""snowed under"" by the escalating intensity of changes on their doorstep.What your donation will do  
Your contribution will fuel Island Reach's direct actions for the Vanua-tai.  We'll provide them with a broad range of essential resources, services, and actions, at no-cost to them:
Live-aboard and transport costs for Vanua-tai and training partners 
as well as participating marine biologists and other specialists.
Fabrication of collection hooks and bags, and purchase of injection 
guns for Crown of Thorns starfish mitigation;  supplies to construct 
coral gardening frames.
Transportation of conservation and food & water security 
materials:  e.g., water collection tanks & systems; construction 
supplies; agroforestry/agriculture & aquaculture resources such as 
seedlings, fish stocks, erosion control plants. 
Operation and maintenance of snorkel equipment,  dive compressor, tanks and gear and RV Llyr's First Responder dive tender. 
Educational outreach: e.g., maintenance of portable video equipment 
and generator for community presentations; reef survey and coral 
gardening training and tool kits; Crown of Thorns mitigation; copying of DVD and paper instructional
 materials concerning climate change, coral reefs, agroecology, and food 
security strategies. 
Identifying species at risk and options for establishing community-managed conservation areas.
Cultural anthropology-oriented documentary film productions for a) 
filming village reefs & actions for local community awareness and 
school presentations; and b) films for wider audiences & supporters.
Delivery of construction skills for conservation projects: 
electrical, mechanical, building, plumbing, motors, alternative energy.
Delivery of intellectual resources: expertise in agroforestry, permaculture & food security adaptations; reef ecology and reef 
husbandry; experience in climate change adaptation and carbon 
farming;  artisanal harvesting and direct market practices that 
advantage family-scale producers; citizen science methodologies for 
surveying coral reefs, marine, and forest ecosystems.
As we direct all of our farm's available resources to Island

Initially established to address the decline of turtle populations around the main island of Efate, the group has greatly expanded its mission in response to mounting pressures in the archipelago.  Today, the Vanua-tai work with their communities across Vanuatu to develop strategies for dealing with issues ranging from coastal erosion to coral reefs in crisis, from climate change impacts on food and water security to sustainable tourism, to protecting species at risk and establishing marine and land conservation areas.  The network has grown to over 400 community volunteers, individuals woven into the social fabric of their villages and islands who have stepped forward to be agents of positive change.  They act as cultural mediaries, building connections between traditional ecological knowledge and practices that have evolved over generations and Western science-based information and methods.

We're efficient-- Island Reach is lean and focused on direct action.--We work with our hands and have mechanical and construction skills.  We do our own maintenance and refit on RV Llyr, allowing more funds to go directly to projects.--Island Reach is ready to multitask, folding numerous projects into the same expedition, saving resources and encouraging collaboration.--Offshore marine vessels are notoriously costly to operate and maintain.   Conditions are rough, the ocean is relentlessly corrosive, and complex, rugged materials must be well maintained with backups for safety.  This is one important reason such vital resources are mostly unavailable to conservation workers in archipelagos.  Research Vessel Llyr, built in Europe, is a modest sized, heavy displacement, steel work-yacht, ketch-rigged for sail with sturdy hardware.  Llyr was carefully selected and fitted for proven efficiency, durability and low cost of operations.We're a family of farmers--Internationally, family farming is recognized for its important economic, cultural, and environmental roles (2014, International Year of Family Farming).  Most Ni-Vanuatu are skilled subsistence and artisanal harvesters, feeding their families and securing small incomes from working land and sea. --We know first hand about connections between labor and the land.  We're sensitive to the economic, generational, and environmental challenges that farm & fisher families face around the globe. --As a vessel with kids on board, we aim to make forest and ocean conservation cool and fun for young people! Today's youth need to be inspired by possibilities and instilled with hope and a sense of adventure. We take a holistic approach--We're human ecologists which means we focus on relationships between people and our environments.  Our approach is interdisciplinary.  Advanced training in the social sciences of cultural anthropology and psychology gives us deeper understandings of forces which shape collective action, and the importance of self-representation for Indigenous Peoples. We engage risk through careful planning and trainingAfter roughly 15,000 nautical miles at sea and five years of training and volunteer work from the coast of Maine to Dominican Republic, Haiti, Panama, and across the South Pacific Ocean States of French Polynesia, Cook Islands, Tonga, and Fiji, working towards our destination of Vanuatu, we've build a dynamic project that:--attests to our resourcefulness and fortitude when encountering adversity.--demonstrates creativity, passion and dedication.--has been well received in both the US and Vanuatu with new partners, like Mission Blue, coming on board to pitch in.We keep you connected!
--We stay in touch with  Island Reach Videos  and social media!--Half of the year we're in the US engaged in Island Reach development and public/professional outreach, working the farm, and meeting BSG-Farm's community of customers.  We bring all of us a little closer to land and sea; from ridge to reef!                                                                          350 Pacific Vanuatu Climate Change Warrior                                               Family ""palm-frond"" sailing home to Lamen Island from their forest garden    What you can do right now!Many of you have known our family for years as friends and neighbors, and as members of our farm-to-table community;  many of you are just meeting us for the first time.  We're asking all of you to be the wind in Island Reach sails and partner with the Vanua-tai, invigorating this remarkable network and helping build their capacity for creativity and innovation, collaboration, and long-term sustainability.  Together, we can protect one of the planet's last great places for all of us and for future generations.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello and thank you for reading. My name is Nicki Anderson and I started farming organically/sustainably in 2011. </p>
<p>I was led to agriculture through the lens of food justice: how can farming provide solutions to the socio-economic-cultural divisions and inequity?</p>
<p>Once I started farming, I learned of the environmental and “well-being” solutions also available in land stewardship. </p>

<p>Kerry Clasby (aka “The Intuitive Forager”) called me unexpectedly and asked if I would help her rebuild her farm after she had lost everything in the Woolsey Fire of 2018. I agreed to come out for a few days in April 2019.</p>
<p>Now, more than a year later, I have found life again and am endlessly grateful for the support and recovery the land has provided me. I want to reciprocate that healing and establish a farm that offers life and abundance for all to enjoy.</p>
<h3>The Dream</h3>
<p>The farm has so much potential for being a demonstrative resource in regenerative agriculture. I want to create this space and share it with community members, near and far.</p>
<p>The contour of the property and the low water pressure (5 gallons per minute!!) have created considerable challenges for me, precluding my ability to expand operations (like planting an orchard and hedgerows!). Government agencies offer excellent support, but their methods and strategies which support farms on a much larger scale don’t necessarily offer the best options for my little plot.</p>
<p>In February, I had the privilege of hearing Warren Brush speak. Not only did his presentation make my heart explode, it also reminded me that even though I “think” I know a lot, I still have SO much more to learn. </p>
<p>Warren’s resume is impressive (see bio below), but it doesn’t even “brush” the surface of the inspiring impact he has had. He does real work that produces real results. It would be an honor to have him walk the property and consult on projects that can bring recovery and healing to land that has provided so much healing to me. </p>
<p>With the support of his expertise, we can develop a Holistic system of Farming at the Malibu Fig Ranch that’s suitable for the Demonstration of methods that regenerate our precious resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the gifts that he’ll be imparting in the management of this land will be made open to the public by me through classes and workshops I will hold throughout the implementation of regenerating this land.</p>

<p>Earthship Biotecture started working in Malawi in 2013, with the construction of a much needed community center in a remote village called Kapita which is aiming towards self-sustainability and independence from external help. The finished building (Earthship Flower Design) will have 8 rooms and will provide the local community with a bank, a library, a storage room, a women's center, and most importantly, water and power to subsist. </p>
<p>Two rooms were already completed in 2013, and they are currently being used as safe materials storage and a bank for the 38 surrounding villages, making a huge difference in the community. But due to a lack of funds and time we were not able to complete the build, causing the community to run out of water half way through the dry season. It became clear that we need to go back and finish the building to cover all the community's needs, provide cool shelter, and be able to catch and harvest sufficient water for everyone.</p>

<p>Earthships include their own utilities made on site. An Earthship uses little to no fossil fuels to provide modern amenities. We are simply adapting basic human needs to the already existing activities of the planet, creating independence for the communities that will benefit from them.</p>

Who we are...
Biotecture Planet Earth is a registered non-profit organization formed with the goal of expanding the use of affordable, resilient and sustainable buildings around the world while educating the public about the architecture, construction and functionality of these buildings. 

Biotecture Planet Earth was founded by Earthship Biotecture in 2014.  Earthship Biotecture is a global company lead by biotecture expert Michael Reynolds, which for the past 40 years has been focusing on building ""radically sustainable buildings"" that reduce the impact on the environment all over the world. Michael Reynolds first started experimenting with self sustainable architecture in 1972, and today is a well known and admired leader in the areas of green and self sustainable architecture.
Some examples of previous humanitarian and disaster relief projects have been done in locations such as Haiti, Honduras, Sierra Leone, Guatemala, Bolivia, Andaman Islands and Taos, New Mexico.


Our goal is to raise the funds to finish two important projects!
This campaign aims to fund two upcoming humanitarian projects in both Malawi and the Philippines in early 2015. The objective is to raise $60,000 which will fund the necessary tools and building materials for Malawi's Kapita Community Center Second Hit (January 12-24th, 2015) and the Philippines Windship Finish Hit (February 9th-20th, 2015).




THE PROJECTS:Malawi Community Center



Earthship Biotecture started working in Malawi in 2013, with the construction of a much needed community center in a remote village called Kapita which is aiming towards self-sustainability and independence from external help. The finished building (Earthship Flower Design) will have 8 rooms and will provide the local community with a bank, a library, a storage room, a women's center, and most importantly, water and power to subsist. 
Two rooms were already completed in 2013, and they are currently being used as safe materials storage and a bank for the 38 surrounding villages, making a huge difference in the community. But due to a lack of funds and time we were not able to complete the build, causing the community to run out of water half way through the dry season. It became clear that we need to go back and finish the building to cover all the community's needs, provide cool shelter, and be able to catch and harvest sufficient water for everyone.


Philippines Windship

Responding to 2014's Typhoon Haiyan, Earthship Biotecture has been joined by a team of local, national and international volunteers building what we call the “Windship” Earthship design in the Philippines. The Windship has evolved from the Simple Survival Earthship design and functions to serve as an aerodynamic storm shelter and school building for a community outside of Tacloban in Leyte Island. 
Partnering with the Earth Village Project and One Block for Batug, Earthship is ready to launch a second hit in order to complete the structure's finishes and to install the power and water systems.  We are also looking to simultaneously building a zero-cost hut in the community made solely from salvaged, local and recycled materials.


Our crew works with our volunteers in training onsite and providing educational presentations throughout the build.  Our goal is to empower all of our participants to implement these techniques in rebuilding resilient structures and creating a more sustainable future.



Why Earthships  



Earthships are buildings that:




Heat and cool themselves naturally via solar/thermal dynamics


 Collect their own power from the sun and wind


Harvest their own water from rain and snow melt


Contain and treat their own sewage on site


Produce a significant amount of food


Are constructed using the byproducts of modern society like cans, bottles and tires.



Earthships include their own utilities made on site. An Earthship uses little to no fossil fuels to provide modern amenities. We are simply adapting basic human needs to the already existing activities of the planet, creating independence for the communities that will benefit from them.


We aim to educate our registered volunteers and local community members of these concepts so they are able to implement these building techniques and further empower their own communities.
Here is what your donation will do:By donating to our project, you are allowing for all of the necessary tools to be available for our crew and local community members to work and train together!
$20 - Sunscreen for Workers Our international and local volunteers work hard and under extreme conditions. We camp and build in extreme temperatures, torrential rains, and anything in between. Water, sunscreen and the appropriate medical kit for emergencies is a must. With your donation, we will be able to provide this to our volunteers and make the project a safer place to be for all participants.
$50 – A Shovel and a PickWithout the right tools, we would not be able to build these projects. By donating towards these tools, you are not only helping us to fund these projects, but most tools are left behind when the project is over and become a durable resource to the community.
 $100 – A Truckload of TiresTires are a byproduct of our society and available in massive quantities. Nevertheless, our projects are in very remote locations and transporting tires and other materials can easily become the most expensive part of our projects. 
 $225 – A solar systemWith these projects, we are able to provide communities with essential electricty and light for a long time. The panels generate DC energy which is then stored in batteries and can be used for lighting and to charge essential electrical appliances.

outside Yellowstone National Park.  After meeting a few of the hunters and diggin' around in some gut piles, she knew she HAD to return to explore the possibilities.  In winter of 2014, Katie gathered a small crew (us!) and returned to Yellowstone to make use of the 
left-behind pieces of the hunt - hides, skulls, bones, fur, organs, and 
more.  We set up camp right outside the hunting grounds, ready at any time to help, to share knowledge, and to offer our skills in anyway the families needed. In the process, we began making connections with the buffalo, the native 
hunters, the Buffalo Field Campaign, park officials, tourists and 
townsfolk alike. Focused on using every part of the animal, The Buffalo Bridge Project is building a bridge between cultures, factions, and political
 lines in the common recognition of the innate worth of the buffalo, and

<p>Out there in the wild Yellowstone valley, we'll face extreme winter weather, including sub-zero temperatures and blistering blizzards.  We'll be living and working using ancestral technologies to harvest massive amounts of buffalo bounty, which will be a great feat of both physical and emotional strength.  We'll be piecing back together a very fragmented and incomplete knowledge of how to brain tan buffalo skins in such extreme conditions, basing most of our technique on personal experience, the limited literature that exists, and the stories of native hunters and their families.  We'll learn to overcome these challenges, we'll work to bring back the Old Ways, and we'll build the bridge between past and present, cultures and races, using the adaptability and vitality of our connections as the bridge between humans.</p>

</div></div>","THE CREW
We are the Buffalo Bridge!   During the winter of 2013, Katie Russell, Professional Wilderbabe, stumbled upon the native buffalo hunt 
outside Yellowstone National Park.  After meeting a few of the hunters and diggin' around in some gut piles, she knew she HAD to return to explore the possibilities.  In winter of 2014, Katie gathered a small crew (us!) and returned to Yellowstone to make use of the 
left-behind pieces of the hunt - hides, skulls, bones, fur, organs, and 
more.  We set up camp right outside the hunting grounds, ready at any time to help, to share knowledge, and to offer our skills in anyway the families needed. In the process, we began making connections with the buffalo, the native 
hunters, the Buffalo Field Campaign, park officials, tourists and 
townsfolk alike. Focused on using every part of the animal, The Buffalo Bridge Project is building a bridge between cultures, factions, and political
 lines in the common recognition of the innate worth of the buffalo, and
 our own shared humanity.
Last year was so successful that we'd like to return this winter, and we need your help!


Ecological Impact

Less than 200 years ago, 60 million buffalo roamed the country. Their grazing patterns maintained the integrity of our native grasslands. They recycled nutrients back into the soil with every step, planting seeds, fertilizing and watering as the herds migrated over the prairies. Their wallows created much needed prairie lakes and ponds with precious freshwater ecosystems. They provided food and shelter for innumerable species, from frogs and lizards to antelope and beetles. The buffalo were one of the most important keystone species in the ecology of the plains, often referred to as ""large scale ecological engineers.""


Cultural Impact          Many of the nation's First People depended on the buffalo for most of their survival needs. Because they provided so much, the herds of bison became integral to almost every part of human life; they offered food, shelter, clothing, children's toys, 
silverware, blankets, clothing, rope, bags, water carriers, bowstrings, 
glue, tools, fire fuel, and more.
The herds once numbered in the millions, and provided a comfortably abundant life for many of the buffalo hunting people. By the early 1900's, however,  European colonization had almost completely eradicated the species. Within a few generations, as few as 23 wild Bison remained. These solitary animals had survived by finding refuge deep in Yellowstone National Park's boundaries.
The decimation of the wild buffalo was crippling to the cultural biosphere of the First Nations. The very fabric of the native's way of life had been destroyed, and as a result, much of the culture of the buffalo people was lost, relegated to the memories and stories of the people who still remembered the way it once was.
Today, through many years of political conflict and ecological turmoil, the bison population in Yellowstone has grown to around 4,900. These are the last truly wild bison in the country. Yet every year, there is a state-funded culling of the bison, in which Yellowstone officials ship portions of the buffalo herd out to slaughter. 
Very recently, several Native tribes have started exercising their treaty rights to hunt the wild bison, just as their ancestors have for hundreds, if not thousands of years. After almost 200 years of being severed from the very animal that was once the very heart of everyday life, many families are finally able to reclaim their traditions and reconnect with their cultural heritage once again.

                So what does Buffalo Bridge do?

Buffalo Bridge is there to help!  Historically, tribes would have had many more members
present to assist with the harvest of meat, hides, entrails, bones, skulls, and
everything else in a buffalo. Now, with limited hunters and limited time
frames, the Buffalo Bridge crew can offer the vital service of helping hunters,
while seizing the opportunity to learn a tremendous amount about buffalo,
buffalo culture, primitive skills relating to buffalo, as well as the
underrated skills of connection and cooperation across cultures.  We are there to offer our hands, our skills, and our hearts. 




                             Katie and Harmony helping skin

Giving Back     Buffalo bridge is working to help restore and revitalize the cultural traditions that have been destroyed or forgotten with the decimation of the wild buffalo.  We believe we are at a turning point in American history- when we, as descendants of the colonizers, can offer ourselves and our services to the lineages of those who were colonized.  Many of us on the crew are  ""Primitive Skills"" specialists (we like saying ""Ancestral Skills""- these traditions are highly advanced technologies requiring high-level critical thinking) with a huge emphasis on Brain Tanning.        ""What is Brain Tanning?!"" you ask?  It's the traditional way of transforming raw animal skin into supple, beautiful, usable leather.  Using brains.  Yep.  Brains.  This year we will be attempting to keep the tradition of Brain Tanning alive by harvesting and processing buffalo primarily using the technologies that would have been available to 
hunters before the onset of European colonization, just how humans have been doing here in the Yellowstone area for generations.  That means all kinds of fun things, like 
using flint knapped obsidian knives for skinning and scraping hides, 
antler and bone tools to treat the hides, and brains (yep.  brains!) to 
soften and work them.

                     Fleshing a hide: removing the meat and fat
We believe that there's an importance not only to preserve this ancient technique, which is in danger of being lost to time, but also to PRACTICE these skills and use them in our everyday lives, in order to become fluent in them so that we may teach, be taught, share and expand this knowledge in fluid and flexible ways.  (Because watching youtube videos isn't enough!)

                                      Salting hides for long term storageBuffalo Bridge is dedicated to honoring Buffalo Culture by remembering the traditions of the Buffalo People who have been living with 
and hunting buffalo since time immemorial.  We wish to celebrate the 
sophistication, ingenuity, and resilience of these people by attempting 
to reconnect with these Old Ways of living and being.  We also recognize that these traditions are not our own, and we think that its important to re-imagine our own ways of connecting with the land we now call our home.  We feel that all of humanity has a shared past; one in which we all hunted animals and transformed animal skins into clothing, used stone knives, gathered plants, and made friction fire, and through enacting these very ancient patterns, we are able to remember our shared humanity.  That is how we are using the buffalo -  to reconnect with each other, ourselves, and our home. 

                    The heads and horns have many uses.
Last year, we had an open camp to all hunters and curious public eyes alike.  We began sharing and teaching much of our knowledge as we ourselves began to piece back together the puzzle of this shattered past.  Along with tanning hides, we were also interested in utlizing every part of the animal.  We collected and processed all kinds of beautiful, wonderful gifts from the buffalo!  We cleaned bones to make tools for processing hides, or boiled them into bone broth medicine, we began bark tanning the honeycomb stomachs to make bags and hats, we rendered the fat for eating and for salves, we boiled the hooves and hide scrapings for glue,  we cut the horns into buttons and bowls and spoons, we spun rope from the wool, and more.  As we began piecing back together very fragmented knowledge of how all these parts were used,  our connections with the hunters grew as they revived old stories, almost forgotten, and began to make those stories real once again.

Last year was so successful that Buffalo Bridge has since grown to encompass more than just our time out there on the hunt.  We were invited back to the Nee Mee Poo (Nez Perce) Reservation outside of Lewiston, Idaho to teach a Brain Tanning workshop.  We were able to share our skills while learning a tremendous amount from the families we lived with, and we are invited back this spring for an even longer immersive skill share!

We think that with the restoration of these buffalo technologies, more people will begin to see the generosity and importance of the last truly wild buffalo.  We hope that as the cultures of the First Nations grows stronger in the reclamation of a stolen past, that we, as friends and as family, may also grow stronger with the reconnection to our own forgotten history. 
What We Need & What You Get
Our total funding goal is 10,000 dollars.  BUT we have already raised 1,000
 of that, and our supporting grant foundation The Primtive Found, has 
agreed to match us up to 5000 dollars (thanks Primitive Found!).  
So we are asking for 4,000 dollars from people like you!

Risks & Challenges
Out there in the wild Yellowstone valley, we'll face extreme winter weather, including sub-zero temperatures and blistering blizzards.  We'll be living and working using ancestral technologies to harvest massive amounts of buffalo bounty, which will be a great feat of both physical and emotional strength.  We'll be piecing back together a very fragmented and incomplete knowledge of how to brain tan buffalo skins in such extreme conditions, basing most of our technique on personal experience, the limited literature that exists, and the stories of native hunters and their families.  We'll learn to overcome these challenges, we'll work to bring back the Old Ways, and we'll build the bridge between past and present, cultures and races, using the adaptability and vitality of our connections as the bridge between humans.

 
  Other Ways You Can Help This is about the buffalo, not about us.  Read buffalo books, check out online buffalo resources, and scope other projects who are interested in helping these critters.  If you can't donate to our project, we encourage you to share this with friends and families who might be interested.  Thank you!

</div></div>","A call for action by Dr Jeremy Leggett, social entrepreneurEveryone who worries about climate change and development knows we are running out of time to act. This is why I am launching this campaign from the climate summit in Lima, Peru, where you can almost smell in the air how much we need examples of ambitious projects that work. I am living in hope that I have two. First, I want to form a club of companies donating 5% of their profits to the struggle against climate change and for development. Second, with this campaign, I want to turbo-charge an organisation, SolarAid, that demonstrates just how much social good you can create with 5% of a company's profits. Why now?There is just a year to go before the vital Paris Climate Summit, where governments must deliver a climate treaty that safeguards the future without leaving millions in poverty. We need to show what important pieces of that future can look like. Also, the British government will double any donation to SolarAid made between Lima and until 5th February by UK residents. (Please don't let this generosity put you off, Rest of World!)                                                                                                                                                             What a 5% gift of company profits can achieveSolarcentury, the for-profit solar company I founded, gives 5% of its profits each year to SolarAid. In turn, SolarAid has attracted further funding and created a retail arm, SunnyMoney that sells solar lights in Africa, recycling not 5% but 100% of profits to the cause. SolarAid's goal is to lift millions from fuel poverty and replace every toxic oil burning lamp in Africa with solar lighting by 2020. Now that would be one massive hit for development and against climate change.So far they have sold 1.4 million solar lights, becoming the biggest retailer of solar lights on the continent, operating out of only 4 of the 54 African countries. Over their lifetime, these lights will save almost a quarter of a billion dollars of African household income. They will allow 1.7 billion hours of extra homework and keep almost 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere*. You can see for yourself the impact every £ invested makes using this Impact Calculator.And here is the detailed research from the field that bears this out. What we still need to doThe challenging news is that we, and the rest of the solar lighting industry, have 249 million more oil-burning lamps to get rid of. SolarAid and SunnyMoney are doing everything they can to expand into new countries, reach more families and raise more funds. This is why I am launching a Founder's crowdfunding campaign. I want to do everything within my power to accelerate SolarAid's work and to provide core funding to strengthen the team and boost expansion. The stronger the core team, the faster they can achieve their mission, the quicker they create the examplar that can attract other companies to follow the Solarcentury-SolarAid model in a 5% club.
The Goal 
A 5% For Climate & Development Club** would be a huge prize: one capable of building a whole new type of capital in the world, a potentially huge pool of it, all dedicated to social good.We all know the power of story telling. This potentially amazing story would help solve a global injustice and embody a new era of the possible, giving us a weapon against those incumbents who say low-carbon poverty reduction is expensive or impossible. Why crowdfunding?I believe that people power is a vital ingredient to create a sane and survivable future. SolarAid and SunnyMoney show how people-power
funding in the developed world can fuel people-power energy - literally! - via
solar lighting in the developing world. 

SolarAid is an continent-wide dream with a big
chance of coming true. The 5% club is a global dream with a fighting chance of
coming true. If ordinary people can help bring both these dreams alive, fast, then we create hope of a road to wider wider renaissance in the years to come.
Please join me, support my appeal over Christmas
and into the New Year, and lets  light a
great big candle for hope for the climate negotiators to respond to.


The team at SolarAid will be supporting my Founders Campaign by providing contributors with solar lights, news from the field and further information. Please see details below. I will also answer questions you have on SolarAid and the 5% For Climate & Development Club via my website:

Perks for supporting this campaign

SolarAid perks: details of solar lights, ambassador packs and reports from Africa. 


Join this campaign and you could receive one of the very same lights that are changing lives every day - as well as other perks and astounding impacts. 


The Economist ""WHICH plastic gadget, fitting neatly in one hand, can most quickly improve the lives of the world’s poorest people? For the past decade the answer has been clear: the mobile phone. But over the next decade it will be the solar-powered lamp.""
http://www.economist.com/node/21560983


The Greenlight Planet Sun King Eco


The Sun King Eco provides 30 hours of clean, safe light - you get one to tell the story of incredible change happening all across Africa, while families get the life-changing benefits  this simple light can bring. The Greenlight Planet Sun King Mobile

The Sun King Mobile solar light  also charges phones enabling families to stay connected and supporting enterprise and opportunity.
The Greenlight Planet Sun King Pro


The Sun King Pro is a bigger solar lamp, often used by solar entrepreneurs to create revenue as they charge mobile phones for neighbours.


The d.light S2


                                     
The S2 solar light is used by millions of schools children every night - improving education, exam results and helping to provide better opportunities for the future.

The Environmentalist perk also includes a personalised copy of Jeremy's recent book: The Energy of Nations. 




In support of Jeremy's campaign, SolarAid would also love to host a supporter and guest in rural Africa - an unforgettable experience.




Solar Ambassadors will receive these packs which include everything you need to inspire others and join the mission to eradicate the kerosene lamp by catalysing solar markets across the continent. 

In Africa, 600 million people live without access to electricity, often relying on dangerous kerosene to light their homes. 
The toxic fumes caused by a kerosene light can cause respiratory illness and eye infections, they can also increase the risk of fire and lock families into fuel poverty, with lighting costs eating up around 15% of their annual income*.







Updates from the Field
Supporters receiving updates from our work in Africa will hear from solar light users, entrepreneurs and teachers. We work to ensure we get detailed feedback and hear directly about the impacts of solar lights. 

Examples of some of the incredible things we hear: 

""If not for the solar lights, we would have been in darkness."" Alex Mulungu, Malawi

""Kerosene was expensive... I did not allow [my daughter] to study at night.. [with a solar light] she is free to study anytime."" Honoratha Elipidi, Tanzania

""I used to find soot in the noses of my children every morning when they slept in a room with kerosene, and they would complain for chest pains."" Veledian Phiri, Zambia

 
Key events for you to attend
World Changers will be invited to our high profile launch events in 2015 (London, New York and Africa) during the UNESCO International Year of Light. 

These will be an incredible occasion to join key stakeholders in the mission to eradicate the kerosene lamp. 

And, of course, the celebrations will be no-holes barred in 2020 when we achieve our goal and see solar lights shining across Africa.  Support this initiative and we will invite you to the end of decade party.

On our last two recycling runs (Dec 10, 2010, Mar 11, 2011), we took 5 metric tons of electronic waste to be responsibly recycled by Supply Chain Services, Inc in Lombard, IL. At $0.12 a pound and $6 a monitor, our final bill was $1,643.04. We need your tax-deductible donations to help cover our costs.
Why should I care what happens to my electronic waste?
In the United States, more than 3 million tons of electronic waste end up in landfills every year. The fraction that is recycled is often sent overseas. In Asia and Africa, at places like Agbogbloshie, Ghana and Guiyu, China, our old computers, TVs, and cell phones damage the environment and undermine the health of the local population. The Internet, computers, and cell phones do great things for the people who can afford them, but how we make them and how we throw them away poisons the land, water, and bodies of those who can't.
FreeGeek Chicago reuses and refurbishes everything we possibly can, and make sure that what we can't use is recycled according to the highest environmental and worker safety standards available, whether we send it to Belgium or Zion, Illinois. We try our best to be transparent about our how we dispose of waste: you can learn more about our
recyclers, view our recent recycling figures, and learn how to recycle a ton of circuit boards yourself.
Join us on a recycling tour with a donation of $100 or more
The best perk we're offering is the possibility to join us on a recycling day and and come tour a recycler as scheduling permits. We know our work isn't glamorous or sexy (our definition of ""all expenses paid consists of a donut, a cup of coffee, and a ride to a random suburb), but we think somebody will get a kick out of seeing what happens to electronics when they die. 


Support a strong community
A few weeks ago, a volunteer found herself locked out of her car as people milled around before a community council meeting and after the biggest day in our history (58 volunteers!). Within 10 minutes, our volunteers had found a towing company that could open her car and put together the $75 needed to get on her way. FreeGeek Chicago is a strong community that needs your money, time, and friendship to get our job done.",3.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</h3>
<p>Just over two years ago (4) <a href=""http://www.boston.com/business/technology/innoeco/2010/10/a_grassroots_cleantech_incubat.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Early Greentown Press"">start-ups joined forces</a> in search of a location from which to launch their entrepreneurial ventures. They were each looking for space to build and test prototypes for their solar-powered refrigeration system, energy management solution, airborne wind turbine, and innovative new compression technology.
</p>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>They met by coincidence and ended up creating <a href=""http://www.greentownlabs.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Greentown Labs</a>, now one of the largest, fastest-growing, and perhaps only entrepreneur-founded clean energy incubator in the world. Greentown is currently home to nearly (30) organizations working to solve our biggest energy and environmental challenges. Our companies currently employ more than 100 people and have already raised more that $25 million to build their innovations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/15655/files/20130816073222-grand-opening.jpg?1376663542"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are a vibrant group of passionate entrepreneurs, innovators, students, and budding cleantech leaders. We've got a great community presence, too. In the last twelve months we've organized dozens of events, given tours to more than 5,000 visitors from around the world, and become a sort of de facto hub for our regional cleantech ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/15639/files/20130816072516-keystone-welding.jpg?1376663116"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>In case you're asking, ""What is a cleantech incubator?""</strong></h3>
<p>Don't worry. Our families often ask the same thing. There are many different types of organizations designed to help small businesses and early stage entrepreneurs, like accelerators, co-working spaces, and incubators. They come in lots of different shapes and sizes, but our incubator focuses on helping early-stage companies and organizations working to build high-impact clean energy innovations (e.g. solar, wind, energy efficiency). We provide them a place to build prototypes, desks for their employees, a place to expand their network, and tools and resources to help them build better businesses. We provide our member companies with desks, prototyping space, discounted access to software and tools, connections to mentors, other founders, and a great network of supporters. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/15659/files/20130816073322-IMG_1085.JPG?1376663602"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Companies pay Greentown a small monthly fee based on their space requirements. We don't take equity or ownership in these companies and we aren't backed by a venture capital or investment fund. We're just a group of entrepreneurs trying to help each other advance clean energy innovations that can help transform our world. Without an organization like Greentown Labs, many of our early-stage innovators would not have the financial runway to launch their businesses. We've never taken a profit from Greentown, nor do we intend to. Our mission and operating model is designed to help get their innovative, game-changing ideas off the ground. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13724/files/20130815074525-IMG_2173.jpg?1376577925"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>We're building a new home in Somerville, MA!</strong></h3>
<p>The amazing demand for our unique combination of prototyping space, co-located offices, and access to a community of energy entrepreneurs and supporters has pushed Greentown Labs to its capacity. We've outgrown our current space and have been forced to put a number of promising young companies on a waiting list. To meet this demand and create a permanent home we're creating a <a href=""http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/07/16/greentown-labs-moving-somerville/sXny5FUVWWlQYvFTxVvYzL/story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Boston Globe Press"">fantastic new space in Somerville, Massachusetts</a>. This is allowing us to more than double our prototyping areas and to add more than 50 new desks for our new and existing companies, in a much-improved facility.<br/></p>
<p>We're also creating a larger event space to enable us to grow our event programming and further promote clean energy in partnership with organizations like the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, Cleantech Open, and the New England Clean Energy Council.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/13659/files/20130815064559-IMG_3064.JPG?1376574359"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Construction is underway and we're incredibly excited about our new facility at 28 Dane Street in Somerville, Massachusetts – a great location and an emerging innovation cluster, just a few minutes walk from the Harvard Square T station, and easily accessible by bike, bus, and car. We're also locating next to some amazing neighbors like Artisan's Asylum (community maker space), Brooklyn Boulders (climbing gym), and the MIT Museum!</p>
<h3>More support for cleanweb and water innovators<br/>
</h3>
<p>Greentown Labs follows entrepreneurs and the cutting-edge places they go. We are finding more and more companies focused on solving problems at the water-energy nexus as well as at the intersection of energy, IT, and data (often called cleanweb). After housing half a dozen companies in these spaces and hosting the last two Boston Cleanweb Hackathons, Greentown Labs plans is expanding its space to better support companies working on cleanweb and water innovations.<br/></p>

<h3>The Details: Our Greentown Grows campaign</h3>
<p>We need your help to meet the demands of the community of clean energy entrepreneurs we support! We've already pulled in an incredible amount of sponsorship from public sources and corporate sponsors, but we're hoping to raise the final $30,000 from our community of supporters we've served for the last several years with inspiring tours, access to our entrepreneurs, high-quality events, and overall clean energy advocacy. Please consider joining our hundreds of our fans and friends that have already lent their financial support to this effort.<span class=""notranlsate""></span><br/></p>
<p>As if supporting entrepreneurs and cleaner sources of energy wasn't motivation enough, we've got some fun gifts to say thank you! We strongly encourage you to become an official ""Friend of Greentown"" in order to take advantage of all the great perks, but we've got something for every budget:</p>

We've still got about $50K of bills to pay to complete the new space so we'd love to keep the momentum going. Please continue to spread the word!9/12 Update: Fay Rotenburg, venture investor and cleantech supporter, has generously offered to match the next $850 of Greentown Grows donations received!
Greentown Labs - A space for big ideas to grow

Just over two years ago (4) start-ups joined forces in search of a location from which to launch their entrepreneurial ventures. They were each looking for space to build and test prototypes for their solar-powered refrigeration system, energy management solution, airborne wind turbine, and innovative new compression technology.

They met by coincidence and ended up creating Greentown Labs, now one of the largest, fastest-growing, and perhaps only entrepreneur-founded clean energy incubator in the world. Greentown is currently home to nearly (30) organizations working to solve our biggest energy and environmental challenges. Our companies currently employ more than 100 people and have already raised more that $25 million to build their innovations.

We are a vibrant group of passionate entrepreneurs, innovators, students, and budding cleantech leaders. We've got a great community presence, too. In the last twelve months we've organized dozens of events, given tours to more than 5,000 visitors from around the world, and become a sort of de facto hub for our regional cleantech ecosystem.





In case you're asking, ""What is a cleantech incubator?""
Don't worry. Our families often ask the same thing. There are many different types of organizations designed to help small businesses and early stage entrepreneurs, like accelerators, co-working spaces, and incubators. They come in lots of different shapes and sizes, but our incubator focuses on helping early-stage companies and organizations working to build high-impact clean energy innovations (e.g. solar, wind, energy efficiency). We provide them a place to build prototypes, desks for their employees, a place to expand their network, and tools and resources to help them build better businesses. We provide our member companies with desks, prototyping space, discounted access to software and tools, connections to mentors, other founders, and a great network of supporters. 



Companies pay Greentown a small monthly fee based on their space requirements. We don't take equity or ownership in these companies and we aren't backed by a venture capital or investment fund. We're just a group of entrepreneurs trying to help each other advance clean energy innovations that can help transform our world. Without an organization like Greentown Labs, many of our early-stage innovators would not have the financial runway to launch their businesses. We've never taken a profit from Greentown, nor do we intend to. Our mission and operating model is designed to help get their innovative, game-changing ideas off the ground. 



We're building a new home in Somerville, MA!
The amazing demand for our unique combination of prototyping space, co-located offices, and access to a community of energy entrepreneurs and supporters has pushed Greentown Labs to its capacity. We've outgrown our current space and have been forced to put a number of promising young companies on a waiting list. To meet this demand and create a permanent home we're creating a fantastic new space in Somerville, Massachusetts. This is allowing us to more than double our prototyping areas and to add more than 50 new desks for our new and existing companies, in a much-improved facility.
We're also creating a larger event space to enable us to grow our event programming and further promote clean energy in partnership with organizations like the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, Cleantech Open, and the New England Clean Energy Council.

Construction is underway and we're incredibly excited about our new facility at 28 Dane Street in Somerville, Massachusetts – a great location and an emerging innovation cluster, just a few minutes walk from the Harvard Square T station, and easily accessible by bike, bus, and car. We're also locating next to some amazing neighbors like Artisan's Asylum (community maker space), Brooklyn Boulders (climbing gym), and the MIT Museum!
More support for cleanweb and water innovators

Greentown Labs follows entrepreneurs and the cutting-edge places they go. We are finding more and more companies focused on solving problems at the water-energy nexus as well as at the intersection of energy, IT, and data (often called cleanweb). After housing half a dozen companies in these spaces and hosting the last two Boston Cleanweb Hackathons, Greentown Labs plans is expanding its space to better support companies working on cleanweb and water innovations.



The Details: Our Greentown Grows campaign
We need your help to meet the demands of the community of clean energy entrepreneurs we support! We've already pulled in an incredible amount of sponsorship from public sources and corporate sponsors, but we're hoping to raise the final $30,000 from our community of supporters we've served for the last several years with inspiring tours, access to our entrepreneurs, high-quality events, and overall clean energy advocacy. Please consider joining our hundreds of our fans and friends that have already lent their financial support to this effort.
As if supporting entrepreneurs and cleaner sources of energy wasn't motivation enough, we've got some fun gifts to say thank you! We strongly encourage you to become an official ""Friend of Greentown"" in order to take advantage of all the great perks, but we've got something for every budget:

Domino's #PoweredByPizza Perk ($10 contribution*):

<h3>About Me!</h3>
<p>I am trying to fund my Trip to USDAA Nationals.</p>
<p>This is my last year being a junior handler and my first year for my first agility dog Jessi to Qualify to go to Nationasl. I have been in love with dogs my whole life. I wanted to do agility since I was five and saw a local agility trial. When I was 12 I got jessi and started training her. after doing agility for about 5 years we are ready for our first Nationals.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For this trip I will need to raise 3,000$ (agility is not cheap) I have been competing for 5 years and payd for short trips and local trials this is the biggest event I have been to and the most expensive.</p>
<p>I will be using the money for</p>
<ul>
<li>travel (driving from Idaho to Tenessee)</li>
<li>Hotel during travel and driving</li>
<li>my dogs entry fee</li>
<li>food</li>
<li>and the other fees that come with competing in agility</li>
</ul><p>If I do not reach my goal to go my dream will not stop there. The money would be put towards my dogs and I competing to qualify for Nationals Next year!</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Like I said it has been my dream to do agility with my dogs since I was a little girl. The first time to Qualify for Nationals only comes once in a life time. At the start of this qualifying year I had no idea that I would Qualify. Our training and hard work had payed off when we made it to our first regional competition. We went in with the mind set of having fun and we found ourselves qualifying for Nationals. Helping fund this trip to Nationasl is helping me fund my dreams.</p>

<p>It's just too hard. For most people, their first experience of reuse is wading through umpteen different websites only to find information which is out of date or doesn't say what they need to know (e.g. that their local charity shop doesn't take TVs any more). So they give up, and throw it away. Wouldn't you?</p>
<p>We wouldn't. <strong>It doesn't have to be that hard.</strong> Using our Give It For Good website all you have to do is enter your item and where you are, see what your options are nearby, then you can decide if you want to give to a charity, to an individual and so on. <strong>Let us do the research, so you can do the giving.</strong> We'll always be free for individuals to use.</p>
<p><strong>If you're an organisation you will benefit too. Give It For Good</strong> will help you get more donations of what you need, more often. If you're a little community project that needs spare fabric, now you have somewhere for people to find you. If you're a larger organisation, you can update your details yourself without having to hassle the council. And <strong>it's easier for councils</strong> - less maintaining of websites and less rubbish to collect means lower council tax.</p>
<p>We have a prototype at <a href=""http://giveitforgood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://giveitforgood.com"">http://giveitforgood.com</a>, and years of experience in promoting reuse via Freegle (<a href=""http://ilovefreegle.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://ilovefreegle.org"">http://ilovefreegle.org</a>). This crowdfunder is to develop the full site and fund a 6 month pilot project listing all the options in Brighton and Hove. In future we intend to follow that up with a regional roll out across the South East and then extending nationally. We will make this self-sustaining, probably by organisations paying a small annual fee for a location to be listed - more than covered if they get a couple of extra donations a year.</p>
<p>Reuse will never be mainstream in the UK unless it's easy.<strong> Let's make it happen.</strong></p>
<p>We're aiming for £15,000 to fund the development and pilot.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we get less than £5,000 then, sadly, we cannot proceed. We will offer you a refund of your donation (including the 9% indiegogo will have deducated).</li>
<li>If we get between £5,000 and £10,000 then we cannot proceed with the pilot, but we will be able to build something which will give us a much better chance of winning further funding. We will ask you if you want your donation to go towards this or have it back.</li>

the Pratt Bar, a sunny Middle Fork beach with spectacular mountain views. The Mountains to Sound Greenway Trust needs your help to raise $25,000 by May 1st for two trail construction projects - so everyone can enjoy these wilderness jewels, tucked away in a wild valley just beyond
the Seattle metro area.Once plagued by illegal dumping,
shooting and widespread trashing of the river corridor, the Middle Fork
Valley today is an amazing story of a regional treasure reclaimed. For nearly 20
years, the Greenway Trust has worked with land managers and other community
partners to improve public access and restore the natural habitat and ecosystems of the Middle Fork. The Valley is now a haven for our outdoor-loving Puget Sound community, but existing trails and recreational infrastructure are insufficient,
unable to handle this surging attention. Valley trails are deteriorating and
riverbanks are once again taking a beating. 








We
need to turn this around, and make sure the Valley has the recreational
amenities to handle all this love. In 2014 the Greenway Trust is teaming up with the US Forest Service and other long-time partners on
these two high-priority projects – and we need your help!Every

For example, a contribution of $15 entitles you to receive an interpreted Tree Ogham reading. A contribution of $25 gets you both the Tree Ogham reading and a water publication in PDF format. With a contribution of $40 or higher you are entitled to receive the reading, the water publication, and a tree PDF publication that is a handy field identification companion. At $70 a rune cast is added. For seven people contributing $173 or higher, messages from the lands and/or waters of Scotland will be relayed from four locations. Donations will be greatly appreciated and spreading the word about the campaign is also very helpful.
Monies that are not used for Scotland travel costs will be used to develop nature connection activities for a urban revitalization charity. Thank you for your support!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The About Face Collective is working to create a community rooftop garden and learning space with a twist: the creative structural elements of the garden will be designed and built by local artists and youth using recycled and reclaimed materials. Together withSkate4Cancer's ""You Are What You Eat"" program, Sketch Working Arts for Street Involved and Homeless Youth, and the Centre for Social Innovation, The About Face Collective will create a unique, inspiring, visually exciting space to promote urban farming, green lifestyles and integrated community engagement.


We are seeking to create a 2200 square foot deck on the roof of the Centre for Social Innovation, Annex location at 720 Bathurst St, Toronto. The deck will hold raised beds, vertical gardening structures, community lounge and education area, all surrounded by green roof space. Our layout considers plotting for food production while also providing adequate amount of space for community use, events and educational programming.






The Impact                                  





This rooftop will have long lasting environmental and social impacts. Here's a quick look at what we can achieve with this project:

Environmental Impact: Converting black tar rooftop space into green space helps reduce storm water runoff and also the ""heat island"" effect which contributes to smog and poor air quality in urban spaces. Not to mention, more plants in any situation equals more absorption of CO2, also leading to more breathable air.  We'll also be putting rain barrels on the roof which will help conserve water. And, last but not least, we'll be growing food, selling it in the building below and using it on-site in educational programming, effectively ELIMINATING the emissions it normally takes to transport produce into urban areas!


By showcasing the creative and functional possibilities of materials often thought of as disposable, we hope to inspire waste reduction. Not only will we reduce landfill waste ourselves, but also to inspire others to see the amazing aesthetic and practical potential that exists for recycling and reusing.



Social Impact: We'll be giving youth, artists and other community members unique educational and employment opportunities throughout this project. Educational programming will be offered in the initial development process in the form of workshops, so that interested community members learn about different stages of creating a rooftop garden.

We're teaming with local artists including the crew at Sketch Working Arts for Street Involved and Homeless Youth. We'll be offering paid residencies to youth who are passionate and artistic but are encountering barriers to employment. These opportunities give them unique and exciting job experience which can help launch them into future careers in creative or environmental sectors. 

Our regular scheduled programming, in partnership with Skate4Cancer, will take the form of half-day educational sessions for school and community groups. Programs will focus on agriculture and urban gardening education, sustainable art and design, nutritional information and simple, healthy food preparation. The programming will seek to show the food process in its full cycle, from seed to meal. We will take a creative approach to food education, integrating art, nutrition and sustainable possibilities. Fun!



The space will also be open to the general public and available for rental for special events, workshops and gatherings. It will serve as a unique and artistically inspired space that will appeal to a wide variety of communities in the GTA. 

 










What We Need                             
We've already hosted a successful fundraiser,  gained the support of Live Green Toronto, The Big Carrot, and lots of support from our own community members. We're applying for grants and sponsorships like it's our job, but we still need support from you! We've got some dough to go to reach our full fundraising goals to cover our budget of $240,000. 

Where does that number come from? Well, not only are we creating the rooftop deck, but we also need to build all the necessary drainage equipment and underlying structure to make sure the deck can support the weight of the garden and green roof elements. This requires not only quality equipment, but also services from sustainability specialists, including architects, engineers and contractors.  We'll also need to construct appropriate access to the roof (right now there's only a ladder; eek!). 

As mentioned, we also want to employ youth and local artists (with decent wages!) to help design, build and bring artistic sensibilities to the space. We believe in the value of creative work and in the potential for artists to bring important social and environmental issues to light, to make them exciting and attractive to the community. 

We'll also need to buy tools, create educational resources, and of course seeds, plants, lightweight soil alternatives and other garden-related items. It all adds up fast!



Other Ways You Can Help          
Please help us spread the word! Share our campaign with your friends who care about the environment, art, youth, culture, food, health, the Earth, and, well, EVERYTHING! 

If you're in the Toronto area and would like to volunteer your skills to this project, holler! Add your passion to our growing group of diverse and passionate community members.

Perks will be sent at the close of the campaign.

For three years Slovak filmmaker of wild nature Erik Baláž, together with his friends Karol Kaliský and Jozef Fiala, trekked the length and breadth of the mountains and forests of Eastern Carpathians, a region that straddles Slovakia, Poland and Ukraine. They were searching for elusive wolves and other extraordinary animals, which share this territory.



They discovered a world almost untouched by people. Ancient people once revered the wolf and lived side by side. In later centuries, hunters hunted for wolves to their near extinction and farmers occupied more and more land. Only the most resilient plants and animals survived this onslaught. Today Erik’s team records a precious portrait of a wilderness as if reborn from the ashes and uncovers this unique ecosystem.

This is the story about the rebirth of European wilderness, in which the wolf, the wisent, the bear and other rare animals live as freely as centuries ago. Take a look with us into the wild area of the Eastern Carpathians, formerly known as THE WOLF MOUNTAINS.

<p>Three years ago we read a news article about plans to build a 6-lane toll road that would run straight through a State Park outside of San Diego.  We were shocked.  How could an argument to obstruct a State Park even be on the table?  Didn’t dozens sacrifice everything years ago to create these places as parks in order to preserve their beauty and heritage for all of us…forever?</p>
<p>We quickly wrote a letter to decision-making park supporters suggesting that if this argument was serious, something was “off.”  If they agreed on the importance of getting word out on how important these places are –how invaluable they are now and into the future – and how at risk they could be – a film on the subject might inspire people to keep it that way.  </p>
<p>The powers that be said yes. Within a year, amazingly, we succeeded in raising productions funds and began filming.</p>
<p>In the end, after visiting nearly 100 state parks and shooting for 61 days in 47 parks, we produced a two-part “limited series” called CALIFORNIA FOREVER for PBS.  Two one-hour programs tell the story of California State Parks, the most diverse state park system in the nation.  Episode One celebrates its sweeping history and Episode Two explores the challenges state and national parks across the country will face in the next century.</p>
<p>We have finally completed both episodes of CALIFORNIA FOREVER and PBS will broadcast the programs nationally this fall.  THIS IS HUGE !! We cannot tell you how excited we are to get these programs finished and out into the world.  It is the culmination of hundreds of people and their commitment to California State Parks, as well as their labor over the last three years.  </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>David Vassar and I of Backcountry Pictures are passionate about producing programs that impart a sense of wonder about the natural world and inspire you as viewers to establish your own personal bond with nature.</p>
<p>Whle we have succeeded in raising dollars to produce California Forever --we now face a final hurdle to raise additional funds for promotion and publicity to bring viewers to the broadcast – and inspire audiences to preserve these storied places for all of us, now and for generations to come.</p>
<p>If no one sees the show we fail.  It’s that simple.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p><strong> My first destination along my journey in mending the Earth was Sustainable Kashi, in Sebastian, Florida.  The picture of the garden above was taken there, and what you see is a mandala garden bed we made.  It is layered 4 feet deep of dead tree logs, branches, straw, compost, bio-char, peat moss, manure, more straw, and lastly seaweed.  One of the major goals of permaculture is to be constantly adding nutrition and organic matter to the soil, to create a sustainable system.  With a little bit of care this garden bed will create organic fruits and vegetables long into the future, feeding the people the way we feed the soil.  The Kashi Community is a spiritual one, centered around a peaceful pond and inviting shrines.  It was the perfect place to start a journey,  and I am so grateful to have been there.  If you want to see what Kashi is doing with their permaculture program, check it out here - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SustainableKashi?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/SustainableKashi?fref=ts</a>.  <br/></strong></p>

<p><strong>I need this money to complete a course in Permaculture which will give me the ability to get better jobs where I can make more of an impact with my passion and knowledge.  For contributions starting at $50 I will promise an exchange of CSA produce.  I can agree to help market for other businesses and could trade work hours in exchange for donations.  For all donations above $10 a donation of equal amount will be made to a food pantry or shelter, in order to help the community and spead good works. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You contribution to my campaign does not only help me.  You help the Earth, literally.

</div></div>","This is Igor. He can be seen in Lyon, France doing regular things with regular people. 


This is also Igor.


You see, Igor is a bit..unusual. For one, he grew up on a sailboat with his family.



He also has a tendency to do unusual things in unusual places.


Some might say he’s reckless. Others think he is extraordinary. 


More recently, he’s been trying to sail around the world on a catamaran with his friend Beto. They have already crossed the Pacific..from Chile, South America to Australia. 


Now they’re trying to cross the Atlantic on a 3,000 nautical mile journey from Cape Town, South Africa to Rio, Brazil. That is longer than the distance from New York to Los Angeles.


Obviously, Igor is no sissy and he’s going to do it without a motor in his 25-foot catamaran, Picole.


If you think he’s being unreasonable, let us add that he’s sailing without a cabin either. That’s right, just the open seas, open air, Igor and Beto on month-long voyage across the South Atlantic ocean. Might we add that nobody ever done this before?

Why is he doing all this? Well, because he can. Because someone needs to push the boundaries of what is reasonable and what is possible. Also, there’s the matter of promoting a greener planet through clean energy.So if you’re for pushing boundaries and helping Mother Nature, support Igor and Beto on their expedition. Your contributions will be used for:

Payment to the boat architect
Payment to the boat builder
Manual water maker
Food
Special Clothing for the Trip
Plane tickets
Import customs and fees in South Africa


As they say, every dollar counts. And if Igor is lucky enough to raise extra money, he will use it towards his upcoming crossing of the Indian Ocean. So don't forget to contribute and make you sure check out the excellent perks waiting for you on the right side on this page.

Thus, the nonprofit Greensburg GreenTown was formed.  GreenTown’s mission was to help the people of Greensburg realize their sustainable mission by providing resources for environmentally conscious reconstruction. Sustainable building is key to reducing environmental impact and conserving energy because as of 2011, <a href=""http://architecture2030.org/the_problem/buildings_problem_why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">buildings accounted for 47.8% of US energy consumption as opposed to transportation (28.1%) and industry (23.2%)!</a></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""> In 2011, GreenTown was ready to take the lessons they learned in Greensburg’s “living laboratory” of sustainable building  to help other communities rebuild after disasters. Since its creation in 2007 GreenTown has seen 10,000 visitors from 48 states and 16 countries! </span>

This project allows visitors to see sustainable residential reconstruction first hand, without having to intrude on private homeowners. GreenTown’s first EcoHome, the Silo EcoHome, was completed in 2010.  The Silo Home gives visitors an opportunity to see sustainable practices first hand and actually use different technologies. Some of the sustainable features in the Silo Home include: concrete building envelope, round form (for wind resistance), bamboo floors, a green roof (planted with sedum), dual-flush toilets, repurposed furniture, and more.  Visitors also have the option of spending the night in our Bed and Breakfast in the Silo Home to get a fuller experience of sustainable living.</span>

</div></div>","Quick overview of our project:
Here at Greensburg GreenTown, we are trying to finish an eco-demonstration home called the Meadowlark House. This house will be built to Passive Standards (using 80-90% less energy than a conventional home) with many more sustainable features to boot.  The goal of the Meadowlark is to promote sustainable building strategies as well as small green changes to eco-tourists who visit Greensburg.  Visitors will get free tours of the home and the option to stay in its Bed & Breakfast to experience green living in depth! The project was started with all the funds secured, but an unforeseen circumstance with our primary funding source left GreenTown needing to secure additional funding to complete the home.  We are raising money for siding, exterior doors, windows, and the installation of those items for the home.  Thanks for your interest!
 
Greensburg, KS: Model Green Community

Five years ago, the town of Greensburg, KS was destroyed by a 1.7 mile wide tornado.  Eleven people lost their lives and 95% of the town was destroyed, but in the wake of this tragedy, the resilience of community was apparent.  They decided to stay in Greensburg and rebuild it as a model sustainable community.   While it may seem odd that a green agenda took hold in the traditionally conservative state of Kansas, to the people of Greensburg, sustainable rebuilding just made sense; it conserves resources and saves money. Thus, the nonprofit Greensburg GreenTown was formed.  GreenTown’s mission was to help the people of Greensburg realize their sustainable mission by providing resources for environmentally conscious reconstruction. Sustainable building is key to reducing environmental impact and conserving energy because as of 2011, buildings accounted for 47.8% of US energy consumption as opposed to transportation (28.1%) and industry (23.2%)! In 2011, GreenTown was ready to take the lessons they learned in Greensburg’s “living laboratory” of sustainable building  to help other communities rebuild after disasters. Since its creation in 2007 GreenTown has seen 10,000 visitors from 48 states and 16 countries! 

Chain of Eco Homes:


In the wake of the disaster GreenTown conceptualized the Chain of EcoHomes project. This project allows visitors to see sustainable residential reconstruction first hand, without having to intrude on private homeowners. GreenTown’s first EcoHome, the Silo EcoHome, was completed in 2010.  The Silo Home gives visitors an opportunity to see sustainable practices first hand and actually use different technologies. Some of the sustainable features in the Silo Home include: concrete building envelope, round form (for wind resistance), bamboo floors, a green roof (planted with sedum), dual-flush toilets, repurposed furniture, and more.  Visitors also have the option of spending the night in our Bed and Breakfast in the Silo Home to get a fuller experience of sustainable living.

 

The Silo Eco Demonstration Home
 

The second project in the Chain of Eco Homes that GreenTown undertook was construction of the Meadowlark Home.This home adds to the experiential learning opportunity by offering new products and features to explore.  After an intensive selection from 250 designs, the Meadowlark design was picked featuring wooden insulation blocks (popular in Europe, but not yet established in America) and Passive design.  Passive houses are very well-insulated, practically air tight homes, that can use up to 90% less energy than traditional home design.  The house generates heat primarily through passive solar gain (the increase in temperature from solar radiation) and internal gains from people and electrical equipment.  The house stays cool by means of solar shading, window orientation, and an energy recovery ventilator. Passive design is achieved through strategic positioning of the house in relation to the sun, large windows to allow for natural daylight, superinsulation in the walls, roof, and floor, natural ventilation via window placement, and other design considerations. 

 
Meadowlark is a naked home facing an impending winter. 
 
Construction began on Meadowlark with a clear, bright future with all the funds secured, but an unforeseen turn of events with our primary funding foundation left GreenTown in need of having to raise additional monies in order to complete the house. The foundation, building envelope, and roof of the house are complete, except for windows, doors, and siding.  Please help us reach our $50,000 goal, which would get us windows, doors, and siding, plus installation.  The windows are triple pane with frame insulation, which will keep with passive house standards by maximally conserving energy.  The windows are especially critical to energy conservation because they let in natural light, which lets in heat energy during the winter. This heats the concrete floor, which means the overall heating needs for the home are reduced. Solar shading protects them from doing heating the house during the summer. The doors and siding are critical for the house endure the winter.  All of these items will bring us a big step closer to completing this second eco home. 
 

Meadowlark's current state of affairs. 
 
 
Your donation will help us bring sustainable building concepts to the American public.
 
When the house is complete it will be free and open to the public, showing visitors another way to build sustainably!  The system of wood blocks used for the Meadowlark is not used by any other building in America, so the Meadowlark house has already made history.  We just have to finish it.  When visitors experience the sustainable practices we have implemented here in Greensburg, they are inspired to incorporate those practices into their projects.  From the figures in the first section involving energy expenditure, green building has the most potential to cut down our energy consumption in the US.  We have companies who have pledged to donate energy efficient appliances, landscaping, patio, lighting fixtures, and more, but who cannot make these valuable contributions until other aspects of the house are finished.

<h3>The Story<br/>
</h3>WE ARE SORRY BUT INDIEGOGO LINKS VIA PAYPAL DO NOT WORK, THEREFORE, YOU CANNOT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAMPAIGN. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS RESOLVED. Conventional
agriculture which engages the practices of tilling, chemical fertilizers,
herbicides, pesticides, inefficient irrigation and heavy dependence on fossil
fuels has resulted in depleted soils and decreased crop yields on an
international scale. The introduction of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO’s)
has rapidly accelerated the soil depletion process and produces foods that are depleted
of basic nutrients and essential minerals that are necessary for human
health.

Organic Solution

Organic
farming is certainly not new. There is evidence of growing cultures of organic
farmers worldwide. Urban gardens, Permaculture organizations, rooftop gardening,
farmer’s markets and large scale organic farming reported as thirty-nine
billion dollars in 2015, (USDA 2015 report). 
What

and plants and what is essential for healthy plant growth. This means education
and easy to use organic soil amendments that are designed to support healthy
soil which, in turn, supports excellent plant growth.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Cocos Island National Park
is world renowned as an exceptional reservoir of biodiversity and endemism,
aside from being a site of unmatched scenic beauty. The site was declared
UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. 
The famous
marine scientist, diver and nature filmmaker Jacques Yves Cousteu called Cocos
Island “the most beautiful island in the world.""
Its waters host more than 30
unique marine species found nowhere else on Earth, that represent more than 40% of the total marine
endemic species in the world. More than 600 fish species are estimated to live within the boundaries of the protected area, with an average density of 7.8 tons per marine hectare, according to the park. Among the most
emblematic species are the giant manta ray, humpback whales, bottlenose
dolphins, whale sharks, white point sharks and hammerhead sharks. In fact, the
island is also known as “Shark Island” due to their abundance, including the
largest schools of hammerhead sharks known in the world. The main threat
affecting Cocos Island is illegal fishing, both inside
and outside the protected area’s boundaries, that seriously alters the delicate
marine ecological dynamics of the island by considerably reducing species’
populations that are critical to such balance. This in turn increases the demand for these species, namely tuna,
lobster, and shark fins (specially for Asian markets), among others, that lead
to the use of low-cost and highly extractive techniques that can supply that
demand. All Aboard for Cocos Island is a joint initiative between Forever Costa Rica and Friends of Cocos Island (FAICO), two local NGOs, that have joined forces with a local TV channel, Channel 7, a phone operator, Kolbi, and a newspaper company, La Nación, to create a crowd funding  campaign that seeks to raise $200,000 to purchase a speedboat to intercept illegal fishers. The boat will be donated to the National Park System, so that the park guards can operate the boat and help increase control and surveillance in this site. For the next two months, donations will be collected via text messages, bank deposits, at supermarkets and at special public collection events.
What we need 
We need to raise $200,000 to purchase a speedboat that has the capacity to intercept illegal fishers. The park guards in the island struggle daily with the task of patrolling the waters, and this boat would improve the park’s capacity to intercept boats within the protected 12 nautical miles. Forever Costa Rica has been working with Conservation International and with the support of the Oceans 5 Foundation to install of a radar in this island, to help track vessels illegally entering the area. The speedboat will help the park guards react immediately to prevent illegal fishing and deter poachers. The funds will also help provide maintenance and repairs for the speedboat. 
The Impact
Few places remain on this earth where we can still see what the oceans were like hundreds of years ago. Cocos Island is one of those places, where abundant marine fauna, especially large predators, have earned this place the label of the ""Serengeti of the Seas. "" However, recent studies show that the shark population in Cocos is declining rapidly.  We cannot afford to lose this battle against illegal fishing. Please help us protect this wonderful place.

Flights cost around $2,000 round trip, not including the travel costs from Delhi to Ladakh. None of the funds will go directly to ISEC, I am only fundraising to get myself there to work with them. For contributions, I am making new paintings, prints, and other visually pleasing and fun creations! For a contribution of $36-$99, I'll send you a new small art piece. For $100 or more, I'll send you a larger new art piece. If you contribute $400 or more, I will commission something for you or someone you know - whatever size and medium you would like!The ImpactLadakh is one of the most remote regions of India, nestled high in the Himalayas. Helena began work in Ladakh over 30 years ago, and since then has witnessed its rapid globalization and the intense environmental, social, and economic implications. The result has been increasing community and family breakdown, unemployment, sprawling urban slums and pollution. Since 1975, ISEC has been working in Ladakh to provide Ladakhis with information about conventional development and its impacts in other regions of the world, as well as creating dialogue around more sustainable patterns of development in Ladakh itself, using local knowledge and resources. If I go this summer, I will get to work for an organization whose mission is deeply important to me, as well as experience first hand the conversation around shifting to localized development in Ladakh. I will be directly assisting with and leading programs to  educate western visitors about the harmful and destructive impacts of conventional development that we support simply by being unaware. If you choose to support this fundraiser, you will not only help me to do work that is meaningful to me, but you will be supporting the spread of critical knowledge about how we develop and structure our societies in ways that are destructive, and more importantly expanding the dialogue and education of sustainable solutions everywhere.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you aren't in a position to help at this time, thank you for reading this far anyway! If you can, please spread the word about my fundraising campaign and about the work of ISEC. Go see the Economics of Happiness, and then talk to me about it. With love, gratitude, and appreciation,Sophie",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>When we were faced with the question of how to press our debut record, we wanted to do something smarter than CDs. Vinyls are out of our budget, and we were forced to question the practicality of a utility like a CD or vinyl, that are wonderful and romantic to own, but are no longer used as much as digital devices to listen to music. </p>
<p>As a design student approaching graduation at MassArt in May, I have to complete a research project for my degree. The focus of my semester long project is finding an alternative form to release a full length record, utilizing digital technologies used for listening to music today, but avoiding the harmful impact of PVC plastic, poly-wrap, paper, and CMYK printing that are used in the creation of CD's and vinyl records. </p>
<p>To avoid the environmental impact of duplicating hundreds of units made of PVC plastic, we are going to be releasing the worlds very first BLP (Balsa LP) A 12""x12"" inch unique, screen printed and numbered piece artwork that will accompany a digital download of our full length record. </p>
<h2>
<strong>Why balsa wood?</strong> </h2>
<h3><em>Environmental Impact:</em></h3>
<p>Balsa wood comes from a type of tree that is actually classified as a weed, meaning it grows wildly without forced aggregation. The trees themselves can reach a full maturity in as little as 4 - 6 years, and can grow up to 100 feet, making it an extremely sustainable building material.  </p>
<h3><em>Tangible Practicality:</em></h3>
<p>Balsa wood is most commonly used for model plane building, mainly because it is very easily shapeable into any desired shape. ie. 12""x12"" inch, the overly romantic size of a vinyl record sleeve. (yum!) </p>
<h3><em>Economically:</em></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, most plastics used for CD making are imported from China. Low cost, quick and dirty 10 cent pieces of Dioxin coming half way across the planet to sit on the shelves of music fans everywhere while we don't use them to actually listen to the music.  </p>
<p>Balsa wood grows rapidly in several parts of the good old U.S of A, Central and South America. Which means when we place our order, we'll be ordering an American product from an independent American business. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What we need $ for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>250 Sheets of beautiful Balsa</li>
<li>Eco-safe Screen printing Ink + Screen Materials</li>
<li>Eco-friendly Tote bags (to carry the release in the night of the big event!)</li>
<li>V-Neck Shirts</li>
<li>Crop Top shirts (for the ladies)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Note:</h3>
<p>For all these reasons above, we ask you to help us fund this project and make this possible. We've never been so damn excited to release a piece of music in our lives, so your pledge will forever hold a piece of our black, yellow (and now green) hearts. Thanks! ( :</p>

<h3>The iLuvMyPlanet Story</h3>
<p><em><strong>""Earth is spiraling out of control, we are destroying our planet, our future is at stake. Our entire survival as a species is in jeopardy. We must correct our past mistakes, re-discover our spiritual roots and re-invigorate the Great Thinkers of tommorrow. The industrial age has left the planet sick. We need to make things better""</strong> </em>Twizz D. Ha - Founder/CEO</p>
<p>“Twizz, a creative artist/entrepreneur in Silicon Valley wanted to use his expertise of building tech startups to do something that would make a positive difference in the world. So he turned his attention to saving the planet.”<br/><br/><strong>The idea for ""iLuvMyPlanet! - The First Purpose Driven Social Network""</strong> came to Twizz while he was working on his boat engine at Pier 39, San Francisco. He got frustrated because there was all kinds of oil and sludge that came out. He knew that this gunk would eventually pollute the ocean and our atmosphere. From that moment he realized that something had to be done to change the mindset of the world. So he did some soul searching, looked back to his childhood. He remembered playing on hillsides along small creeks, being outdoors, exploring beaches and parks. Twizz knew that he had a deep love and respect for nature, the ocean, different plants and animals. He started spending more time in the garden, growing vegetables, planting trees and connecting with nature on a deeper level. His eating habits also changed, along with a regular exercise regimen at the local gym, he even got some old bikes to fix up from local yard sales. Each Saturday morning was a trip to the local farmers market for fresh fruits and vegetables. <br/><br/><strong>From this great spiritual awakening the ""Inspiration for iLuvMyPlanet!” came. “It was so simple and natural how it came to me.” says Twizz.</strong> <br/><br/><strong>Two events that he attended would inspire him to take action. One was the TED Silicon Valley event at Stanford called ""Innovation for Social Change.""</strong> There were all these great thinkers, talented artists and inspirational speakers at the event on stage talking about social change. The event truly inspired him to do something great for the planet. The other was the San Francisco Green Festival that he attended with his friends. ""It was great to be able to see this huge movement that was happening. All the vendors, the great food and the music was amazing!""</p>
<p>Since Jan 2010 after receiving some seed funding from a close friend, along with his own time and money, he was off to the races. After many months of dedication, perseverance and working on the project till late nights. All while juggling day to day work from his design studio, ten months later on 10.10.10, the site was launched to the public. <br/><br/><strong>He hopes that each new member can go thru the same spiritual awakening as he did and reconnect with nature, the planet and the global community. They can change their lifestyle, live a healthier and more spiritual life. ""We must correct our past mistakes, re-discover our spiritual roots and re-invigorate the Great Thinkers of tomorrow. The industrial age has left Planet Earth sick, we need to make things better"" says Twizz.</strong> <br/><br/>The site is open to anyone on Planet Earth; Empowered Citizens, Change Agents, Visionaries, Filmmakers, Photographers, Artists, Musicians, Inventors, Explorers, Environmentalists, Animal Lovers, Nature Lovers, Writers, Eco-Friendly Businesses and Great Non Profits.

“Twizz, a creative artist/entrepreneur in Silicon Valley wanted to use his expertise of building tech startups to do something that would make a positive difference in the world. So he turned his attention to saving the planet.”The idea for ""iLuvMyPlanet! - The First Purpose Driven Social Network"" came to Twizz while he was working on his boat engine at Pier 39, San Francisco. He got frustrated because there was all kinds of oil and sludge that came out. He knew that this gunk would eventually pollute the ocean and our atmosphere. From that moment he realized that something had to be done to change the mindset of the world. So he did some soul searching, looked back to his childhood. He remembered playing on hillsides along small creeks, being outdoors, exploring beaches and parks. Twizz knew that he had a deep love and respect for nature, the ocean, different plants and animals. He started spending more time in the garden, growing vegetables, planting trees and connecting with nature on a deeper level. His eating habits also changed, along with a regular exercise regimen at the local gym, he even got some old bikes to fix up from local yard sales. Each Saturday morning was a trip to the local farmers market for fresh fruits and vegetables. From this great spiritual awakening the ""Inspiration for iLuvMyPlanet!” came. “It was so simple and natural how it came to me.” says Twizz. Two events that he attended would inspire him to take action. One was the TED Silicon Valley event at Stanford called ""Innovation for Social Change."" There were all these great thinkers, talented artists and inspirational speakers at the event on stage talking about social change. The event truly inspired him to do something great for the planet. The other was the San Francisco Green Festival that he attended with his friends. ""It was great to be able to see this huge movement that was happening. All the vendors, the great food and the music was amazing!""
Since Jan 2010 after receiving some seed funding from a close friend, along with his own time and money, he was off to the races. After many months of dedication, perseverance and working on the project till late nights. All while juggling day to day work from his design studio, ten months later on 10.10.10, the site was launched to the public. He hopes that each new member can go thru the same spiritual awakening as he did and reconnect with nature, the planet and the global community. They can change their lifestyle, live a healthier and more spiritual life. ""We must correct our past mistakes, re-discover our spiritual roots and re-invigorate the Great Thinkers of tomorrow. The industrial age has left Planet Earth sick, we need to make things better"" says Twizz. The site is open to anyone on Planet Earth; Empowered Citizens, Change Agents, Visionaries, Filmmakers, Photographers, Artists, Musicians, Inventors, Explorers, Environmentalists, Animal Lovers, Nature Lovers, Writers, Eco-Friendly Businesses and Great Non Profits. ""The company will actively promote all the members, artists, professionals and green companies along with all the great non profits that are working hard to save the planet."" Along with his biz partner Mel, a prolific producer in Hollywood, and Tanya von Zychlinsky, coFounder, passionate visionary guide, clairvoyant creator and evolutionary leader, they plan to build a great company to serve an ever greater need: Saving The Planet.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Cocreate - Float - Share


Asap
island is the vision of an autarkic sustainable floating island, out
of recycled and renewable materials. It
is low-tech, low-budget and open source, to help the people in flood-affected areas worldwide to raise their climate change resilience. It also serves as a global floating makerspace for open maritime innovations. Got it? A little open island for a better world.
Started by the german street artist Joy Lohmann in the year 2000, the vision has meanwhile developed into a global community of makers, an artventurous concept and a feasible plan, how to realize it  a.s.a.p. 
THE GOOD NEWS: the construction of the ""as-soon-as-possible island"" is to be started in early 2014 within a 6-week workcamp in Goa/India. The location and riverside is set from our indian team, 4 workshops will be held by experts from 3 continents and I bet, the glocal participants will deeply enjoy to get it done.
We love to invite you to join asap-island, to share your skills and knowledge online or on location. Please help to make it real with us by crowdfunding or spreading asap-island.
With your help, asap-island will become an open-source pilot island, a floating classroom and stage, a ""social sculpture"" art project, a venue and symbol for our caring/sharing community.

כשבונים קירות או מבנים מבטון בחוף הדבר גורם לגריפת החול על ידי הים, החוף נעלם ונשארת רק מדרכה. בחוף דדו בחיפה, בנהריה, בחוף השרון ובחוף הנפרד בהרצליה זה כבר קרה, חוף סידני עלי נהרס כולו ועכשיו העיריה רוצה לעשות את זה גם בחוף זבולון. טיילת שלב א' נבנתה במקום שיש שוברי גלים והחוף רחב. בזבולון החוף צר מאוד והנזק יהיה בלתי הפיך.


אנחנו דורשים לביטול היתר הבניה והתחלת הליך תכנוני בשיתוף הציבור תוך הצגת חלופות לבניה שלא תפגע בחוף.  תוכנית חדשה צריכה לעבור את כל הערוצים והוועדות הרלוונטיות, להתאים לרוחב החוף, ולהיבנות בצורה שתקטין את הנזק העתידי לסביבה.
מטה המאבק לשמירה על חופי הרצליה מנהל מאבק לעצירת העבודות בחוף זבולון עד שימצא פתרון שלא יגרום נזק סביבתי בלתי הפיך. דעת הציבור לא נשמע בהליך מסודר ובוועדות המתאימות. אנו המנהלים את המאבק זקוקים מידית לכסף בכדי לנהל מאבק משפטי וציבורי מול עיריית הרצליה לעצירה מיידית של עבודות בניית הטיילת שעולה כ 16 מליון ש""ח לתושבי הרצליה. 
אנו מגישים עתירה מנהלית לבית המשפט המחוזי וזקוקים לכ 80,000 ש""ח בהוצאות משפטיות. 
אנו בעד הנגשת החוף לכלל הציבור אך חשוב להבין שבניגוד לטיילת הדרומית ליד המרינה, חוף דבוש וחוף זבולון אינם מוגנים ע”י שוברי גלים והם הרבה יותר צרים. ישנן 3 סיבות להתנגדויות לתוכנית:

Target: R1 000 000 ($70 000 / £52 000 / €62 000) Deadline: 31 October 2016​ - EXTENDED TO 21 NOVEMBER!!!SO WATCH THIS SPACE for updates on the LAND, the EXHIBITION and HOW YOU CAN HELP:​#1000PrintsNoFootPrintsOn Instagram: @chris_auretFacebook: facebook.com/auretart& my Website: www.auret-art.comFacebook 1000Prints Catalogue Preview​
​ WHY R 1000 000 ($70 000 / £52 000 / €62 000)? ​R1 000 000 is the amount needed to purchase an 11-Hectare plot of land up the East Coast of South Africa, where I aim to undertake a lifetime project of Reforestation Work and to build a Creative Retreat.I currently have first option on the sale of the property but the offer to purchase must be made before the end of October, when the property will be placed on the market for other buyers. I had been searching for land when this space found me, just a few weeks ago. Born out of frustration at the current state of our fragile world, I realised the need for personal action. To be the CHANGE I want to see. To start a way of life moving with nature, instead of against it. As well as a need for a quiet space to facilitate artistic and spiritual practices. And then to share that space with others. ​I am 100% certain this is the space for the vision.  And I need your help to join me in making this dream a reality. It's not just my vision, it's your vision and therefore OUR VISION. It's still growing and has endless possibilities for the greater good of our environment and our creative hearts.​​WHY #1000PrintsNoFootPrints ?The campaign is based on the idea of gifting a Limited Edition & Signed Print as a reward for a donation of R1000 ($70 / £52 / €62). ​1000 Prints x R1000  = R1 000 000! ​ Will you be 1 of those 1000 or MORE?!​As truthful as most clichés sound, every little bit counts, BIG or SMALL!​

For every R1000 ($70) donated, you will be rewarded with another print.​

For donations less than R1000 ($70), DON'T WORRY! We still love you! You will also be rewarded with a Limited Edition & Signed POSTCARD, of your choice and more (see details below).​

PRINTS will be just smaller than A3 in size, POSTCARDS will be A5 in size.​

FREE DISTRIBUTION & POSTAGE TO ALL MAJOR CITIES AROUND THE WORLD.​

ALL DONATIONS to receive downloads of MUSIC & WRITINGS by myself and friends.​

ECO-FRIENDLY PRINTING​

2. To Build a Creative Retreat:​
A space for you to escape the chaotic and estranged urban environment, to explore yourself within the nature.


A place to write a book, record an album, paint a series of works, read up on that topic you’ve always wanted to read up on but never had quite the stillness or the energy to do so.
A space to DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, while supporting a GOOD CAUSE. 

A space being Yours to visit, therefore OURS more than just mine. ​​

</div><div>
<p>Hola!</p>
<p>Te presentamos al ReBo, una máquina inteligente que se colocará en espacios públicos creada para solucionar los problemas de reciclaje en México. ReBo recibe PET, latas y colillas de cigarro y se encarga de catalogarlos y comprimirlos para posteriormente reciclarlos de manera eficiente.</p>
<p>¡A cambio de sus reciclables la gente recibirá puntos ReBo para intercambiar posteriormente por recompensas como WiFi, descuentos en restaurantes y viajes en Cabify!</p>

<p>Queremos motivar a la gente a reciclar y a cambiar el concepto negativo de basura para comenzar a verlo como un activo.

<p>Además de motivar a la gente a reciclar, ReBo ayuda a eficientar los costos y tiempos de reciclaje ya que reduce de manera significativa el largo ciclo de pasos que se llevan a cabo en el sistema de reciclaje actual.

<h2>ReBo (English)</h2>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>We introduce you to <strong>ReBo</strong>, an intelligent machine that will be placed in public spaces (such as parks, malls, and restaurants) created to solve Mexico's recycling problematic. ReBo receives PET, cans and cigarette butts and takes charge of cataloging and compressing them in order to later on recycle them efficiently.</p>
<p>¡In exchange for their recyclables people will receive ReBo points to swap later on for rewards such as WiFi, restaurant discounts and cab rides!</p>

<h3><strong>How does ReBo has a high impact on society?</strong></h3>
<p>We want to motivate people to recycle and change their negative conception of garbage towards the idea of it as an active. Recycling our garbage we can remarkably reduce our carbon footprint; for example, <strong>¡Recycling 1 can saves up to 95% of the energy that would be used to make a new one from virgin materials!</strong></p>

These connections will be the catalysts transforming ripples into waves of positive, beneficial impact.Climate Changers will come from business, government, organizations, communities and individuals stepping forward as global citizens doing what they can to make a difference. These Climate Changers will not only be reducing and reversing the negative impacts of climate change, they will be creating a more just and sustainable future.Bringing depth and breadth to how we address climate change.Here, you will find individuals from all over the planet sharing all kinds of actions that can be replicated or adapted. An action someone takes in Brazil can be taken by someone in Bangladesh and by someone in Botswana and by someone in British Columbia. Climate Changers is the means for making broad, impactful connections.You will also find groups of individuals taking action that is focused on topics and issues you find of particular interest and importance. For example, you will be able to connect with a growing population of Climate Changers taking various actions on freshwater issues, or climate justice, farming technology, renewable energy and so forth. Here's an example of what a freshwater group will look like:Every Climate Changer will have a introduction page and a profile page. Here's an example of an introduction and profile page. You'll notice the profile page contains the Climate Changers story and more detailed information as well as a point of contact:Where the money will go.It will go to build the Climate Changers online platform and bring this transformative project to the world. This includes:• Building and programming the web site• Outreach to individuals around the world inviting and engaging them to be Climate Changers• Development of content for Climate Changer pages and in-depth profiles• Design and production of Climate Changer pages and in-depth profiles• Development of Climate Changers virtual summit• Promotion of Climate Changers to obtain supporters, partners, collaborators and others vital connections necessary to expand our impact.Climate Changers has been self-funded to this point and now it is time to move from idea to implementation. We figure it will initially take just $130,000 to bring Climate Changers to the world and fund our first year of work. Reaching our Indiegogo campaign goal of $50,000 will definitely put things in motion. Of course, it will be wonderful to surpass our goal!!Who are we?The founder and Project Director of Climate Changers is Jim Armstrong. He's devoted most of his career developing purpose-led communications for businesses and non-profits who have socially responsibility and sustainability as part of their DNA. The company he founded in 1999, Good for Business, was certified as a B Corp in 2010. Their client categories ranged from the environment, energy and education to healthcare, high technology and human rights. Jim's Climate Changers partner is his talented wife, Kathy, who serves as graphic designer and art director.Climate Changers emerges from their experience in communications the the desire to take what they have learned and now apply it to the issue of our time.  Climate Changers also represents their desire to wake up every morning with hope and optimism regarding climate change instead of a sense of hopelessness and pessimism.Climate Changers if a project of the Center for Transformative Action, a 501 (c)(3). Your donation today is tax deductible.You can give climate change a hopeful, human face. Let's make a vital impact together!We know Climate Changers isn't the only solution to climate change, but it definitely fills a critical void by delivering positive, 'can-do' solutions and innovations.bInternational in scope, this project realizes climate change has no borders. It focuses on sharing, collaborating and connecting with everyone who is taking action to address climate change and informing and inspiring others.Your support will help bring to the world an international network of climate change agents eager to share the uplifting actions they are taking.GIVE NOW!  THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE AND SO MUCH TO GAIN.Thanks!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our campaign - Project Platypus, will enable us to design and test at sea, a viable
wide-swath dispersion method that will enable precision mariculture of ocean plants in the surface ocean.
</p>
<p>The fundamental principles of the dispersion method have
already been demonstrated in a trial at one-tenth scale.  That trial represented a significant step
towards the eventual dispersion goal but not in a way that can be applicable to
full-scale operation.  This up-scaling
requirement forms the basis for the currently proposed project, i.e.  full scale design and a one-fifth proto-type testing at sea.   </p>
<span></span>If we can do this then we open the door to a variety of ocean solutions based on the <br/>cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in the<br/>open ocean.   We would be able to match nutrient supply with biological needs<br/>of ocean plants and animals in order to reach a desired marine ecosystem outcome. In this way our processes can support valuable ecosystem services, such as the removal of waste carbon dioxide from the surface ocean and the atmosphere. <br/>The key to remember is that the Platypus Campaign will advance implementation of ocean solutions to serious issues of major concern. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to fund Project Platypus we are seeking to raise AUD $79,000.</p>
<p>After reward settlements the funds will be utilized on the following core activities:<br/>i) Engineering design of unique  ocean dispersion equipment (25%)<br/>ii) Materials and labor for building of a 60 metre swath prototype (15%)<br/>iii) Environmental testing and modeling to support the at sea testing (10%)<br/>iv) Planning and execution of the at sea testing trial (20%)<br/>v) Drone photography  (10%)<br/>vi) Documentation and publication of findings  (20%)<br/></p>
<p>We are excited to offer a range of perks from educational resources, time on board during the research work, to our project memorabilia T-shirts and caps.<br/></p>If we don't reach our full goal, we will scale back our program so that tangible results can still be achieved and only the scale is reduced.<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Amazingly humans in the open ocean are still only hunters and gatherers.   As our population and our impact on the earth grows, we can no longer just sit back and take from the oceans.   To secure our future some management of the open ocean will be necessary for food production or management of waste carbon dioxide. <br/>Multiple benefits may be brought about through managing the linkages between surface ocean community structure and the balance of nutrients available to support life for example:<br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Since 2004 ONC has been working hard on ocean based solutions to climate and food security.  We are a small specialized team comprising engineers, scientists and ecological modelers.  We work collaboratively with universities and marine institutes to tackle the major global challenges facing the world today. 
Our campaign - Project Platypus, will enable us to design and test at sea, a viable
wide-swath dispersion method that will enable precision mariculture of ocean plants in the surface ocean.

The fundamental principles of the dispersion method have
already been demonstrated in a trial at one-tenth scale.  That trial represented a significant step
towards the eventual dispersion goal but not in a way that can be applicable to
full-scale operation.  This up-scaling
requirement forms the basis for the currently proposed project, i.e.  full scale design and a one-fifth proto-type testing at sea.   
If we can do this then we open the door to a variety of ocean solutions based on the cultivation of marine organisms for food and other products in theopen ocean.   We would be able to match nutrient supply with biological needsof ocean plants and animals in order to reach a desired marine ecosystem outcome. In this way our processes can support valuable ecosystem services, such as the removal of waste carbon dioxide from the surface ocean and the atmosphere. The key to remember is that the Platypus Campaign will advance implementation of ocean solutions to serious issues of major concern. 
  What We Need & What You Get In order to fund Project Platypus we are seeking to raise AUD $79,000.
After reward settlements the funds will be utilized on the following core activities:i) Engineering design of unique  ocean dispersion equipment (25%)ii) Materials and labor for building of a 60 metre swath prototype (15%)iii) Environmental testing and modeling to support the at sea testing (10%)iv) Planning and execution of the at sea testing trial (20%)v) Drone photography  (10%)vi) Documentation and publication of findings  (20%)
We are excited to offer a range of perks from educational resources, time on board during the research work, to our project memorabilia T-shirts and caps.If we don't reach our full goal, we will scale back our program so that tangible results can still be achieved and only the scale is reduced.   The Impact Amazingly humans in the open ocean are still only hunters and gatherers.   As our population and our impact on the earth grows, we can no longer just sit back and take from the oceans.   To secure our future some management of the open ocean will be necessary for food production or management of waste carbon dioxide. Multiple benefits may be brought about through managing the linkages between surface ocean community structure and the balance of nutrients available to support life for example:
Climate Change (by sequestering carbon into the deep ocean (Blue Carbon) for long term storage,contributing to atmospheric stabilization)Food Security (by increasing marine productivity and the sustainable harvest from the oceans)Ocean Acidification (by reducing carbon and hence carbonic acid in the surface layers of the ocean).  
  Risks & Challenges  The application of new ideas is a transformational process with many challenges and risks.  When we move from land to the ocean the risks are heightened and the challenges far greater.   So why back our campaign?  ONC have been pioneering these techniques for more than ten years and have built an experienced and trusted team along the way.  To minimize risk and maximize benefit, we work in partnership with leading academics and marine institutions.  
Because our work is at the base of the marine food-chain with microscopic ocean plants there is so much to learn and so many surprising benefits to be gained.  The same plants that give us oil today can help secure a safe future for tomorrow.

<p></p>Forest of Interbeing is a reforestation project run
voluntarily by young mindfulness practitioners all over the world. Our
aim is to purchase, reforest, and maintain deforested land in the Mexican state
of Veracruz in cooperation with the Mexican nature conservation association
DEMATAC, an internationally respected NGO in the region; local communities;
international funders; and the Wake Up Community in Mexico and abroad. Los
Tuxtlas is the northernmost tropical rainforest area in Americ<span>a and an area of high biodiversity value which is home to
many threatened plant and animal species, like the Tuxtla Quail Dove and the Long-tailed
Sabrewing hummingbird. By replanting parcels of land where tropical forest has
been destroyed for ranching, we can have a real impact. Reforestation returns homes
to many living beings and diverse wildlife who have suffered from the
unskillful way in which we have related to nature. Restoring these lands will also allow our
descendants to enjoy a healthy Mother Earth. Our dream is that this Forest of
Interbeing will continue to grow and nourish the intercultural connections and
the collective mind of love in our worldwide communities and Sanghas.</span>
<p>We are currently focusing our efforts on 5 project areas in
Mexico, located in the municipalities of San Andrés Tuxtla and Catemaco in the Los
Tuxtlas region of Veracruz.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/684557/files/20140630084518-Forest_of_Interbeing_map.png?1404143118"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>View Interactive Map <a href=""https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=zH9OGTnFi06w.k27P9JlUtiwY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</i><br/><br/><p></p><p></p>
<p>All of the labor for our projects is donated by dedicated
volunteers and many of the trees we plant are provided for free by a
state-owned tree nursery. Your support allows the Forest of Interbeing to:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase and install fences to protect reforested areas
from neighboring cattle<br/>
</li>
<li>purchase additional trees, including fruit trees, which
provide economic benefit to land owners willing to transform their land into a
forest

</li>
<li>transport trees from regional nurseries </li>
<li>provide meals and transportation for volunteers </li>
</ul><h3>Reforestation Areas (on map above)</h3>
<p>A. In April we began our reforestation efforts in the
community of Ruiz Cortines by collecting
seeds and seedlings from the forest and planting 34 trees on the property of local
resident Mauricio Vázquez.</p>

</i></p><p>B. In July we will assist the
junior high school of Sihuapan in the reforestation of a portion of the
school’s land with approximately 60 trees. With your support, however, we could
make a much greater impact by reforesting approximately 5 hectare (~ 12 acre)
with more than 3,000 trees. </p>

C. The largest reforestation area is in Rancho
Los Amigos, a former cattle ranch transitioning into a center for ecotourism,
yoga and environmental education. They have already reforested parts of their
land and will allow us to reforest a space of 3.1 hectare (7.3 acre), closing a
gap between forest sections on their land and a large remaining rainforest area
on neighboring land. Reforestation here will start on July 25<sup>th</sup> with
a short mindfulness retreat. Local Wake Up participants will be assisted by
volunteers from Rancho Los Amigos, the nearby community La Barra and a group of
young indigenous mindfulness practitioners from Chiapas (7 hours from Los
Tuxtlas by car).

community of Chuniapan de Arriba. The first (Area E) is an area of 0.7 hectare
(1.3 acres) on the land of the Comisariado Ejidal Lucio Pucheta. This area
protects a spring, which provides about 200 people with water. Local community members,
including students from the local junior high school, will assist us in
planting trees. In addition to this land, we will help the community protect an
additional 7 hectare (~ 17 acres) of rainforest on communal land, also serving
as an important water protection area (Area F). Currently, neighboring farmers
do not respect the area’s boundaries and often enlarge their fields,
encroaching onto this land. We will install a stable fence to establish a clear
boundary and prevent further damages. We will also reforest 0.5 hectare (1
acre).</p>

<p>The Jacoby Greenbelt is such a priority because it contains over 3,000 meandering feet of the creek and healthy wooded buffers.  Jacoby Creek provides drinking water for the city of Xenia and impacts the water source for Yellow Springs as well.  Preservation of this property is absolutely central to our mission!  We have dedicated all of our 1% for Greenspace funds towards its protection but in order to protect this critical property, we need help through donations.  Tecumseh Land Trust is seeking to raise $350,000 in order to purchase a conservation easement on the property to reduce the debt on the land purchase and create a tax benefit for bidders interested in working with TLT.  <strong>Please consider making a special donation to the</strong> <strong>Jacoby Creek Protection Fund</strong> <strong>today!</strong>  Donors wishing to do so may make a contingent donation, which means their donation will only be accepted if the fundraising goal is met. </p>

<h1>Jacoby Creek is a Valuable Headwaters Stream for the Little Miami and Beyond</h1>
<p>Protecting small streams in the uppermost parts of river systems is an effective way to improve water quality downstream. Runoff from the land on this property forms small streams that become these “headwaters streams,” recognized for their benefits to water quality like sediment control, nutrient control, flood control, and wildlife refuges. </p>
<h1>Protect Drinking Water for Xenia and Yellow Springs</h1>
<p>This particular stream, Jacoby Creek, flows toward the Little Miami River, and contributes to the ground water aquifer feeding the City of Xenia and close to the aquifer for the Village of Yellow Springs. Both Xenia and Yellow Springs rely on clean ground water for the public water supplies.</p>
<h1>Protect Endangered Species</h1>
<p>The Little Miami River is designated a Wild and Scenic River, home to more than 87 species of fish, 36 species of mussels (including five state endangered species), an endangered turtle and salamander, and numerous species of breeding birds.</p>
<h1>Prevent Harmful Algal Blooms</h1>
<p>The Little Miami flows into the Ohio River, which has seen harmful algal blooms stretching for miles, caused by increased levels of phosphorus and nitrogen. These algae are detriment to aquatic wildlife and can pollute public drinking water sources. Healthy headwaters streams can reduce nutrient pollution.</p>
<h1>Clean up the Dead Zone</h1>
<p>The Ohio River flows into the great Mississippi River which then flows into the Gulf of Mexico. A large “dead zone” has formed, caused by phosphorus and nitrogen largely coming from the Ohio Valley. The increased levels of nutrients have had a significant impact on the fisheries of the Gulf, causing major fish kills and reduced biodiversity. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Help men inside San Quentin gain green knowledge and life changing skills...</p>
<p>Imagine a lively and passionate class of 25 students tackling some of the toughest issues humanity faces today.  People are asking questions, sharing dynamic examples from their own personal stories, strategizing ways to integrate sustainable practices into their own lives and the lives of their loved ones, and organizing action plans to green the very institution where all this is taking place.â€¨ Well, this is all happening in one of the most unexpected yet appropriate settings in Marin County…San Quentin State Prison.<br/>â€¨</p>
<p>Meet The Green Life: a sustainability and self-sufficiency program for the men of San Quentin, by the men of San Quentin. In April of 2009, the peer educators from the long running Keepin' It Real program invited Van Jones, a leading voice for equitable involvement in a new Green Economy, to speak.  His talk and work served as a catalyst for collaboration between the North Block of San Quentin Peer Educator Group of Incarcerated Men, Angela Sevin (founder and director), and community volunteers to develop a groundbreaking eco-literacy and green job preparedness curriculum, striving to share practical pathways for meaningful lives. Now, co-led by Pandora Thomas and Angela Sevin, the peer educators of San Quentin have taken what they learned and launched a pilot class engaging 20 more men in the aim of fulfilling the program’s mission:<br/><br/>""A collaboration of solutionaries from inside and outside communities that inspires and awakens our connection to the earth and each other, by contributing to individual, community and global transformation.""</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Fifty men inside of San Quentin have made the commitment to improve their lives and their communities through their involvement with The Green Life program.  They are clear that in order to do this, they need to understand the environmental implications of their actions, and learn viable alternatives. They, their families, and members of our communities all depend on the skills they will gain through this project.  This project is a pilot and will be spread to other men inside other prisons once we get it the funding we need to take the program to the next level.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In this co-creative, peer-educator learning environment, the men not only create, but prepare, guide, and implement their own curriculum for ecologically sustainable practices, thereby developing as facilitators, trainers, and leaders. By the end of the program, the men will have gained viable skills for enhancing their own living conditions, as well as invaluable personal leadership qualities for re-entry to their communities. In the words of Green Life peer educator, Lawrence Blankenship, “It is a learner centered, performance based program for inmates who want to be an asset to public safety and not a liability. By having employable skills we become positive helpers in our communities and not destroyers.”</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<h3><strong> What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>We need start up funds to pay for finalizing the curriculum, materials which include books and resources to teach the men using hands on activities, stipends, and a green career fair. This year begins the next phase of growth as we strengthen our infrastructure to deepen the impact of our work inside and outside of San Quentin. Broadening our program means an increasing need for support. Based on your donations and support, we would be honored to have you on board as a proud partner in The Green Life.  â€¨</p>
<p>All donations up to and beyond the $100 level will get a shout out on our Facebook page. And of course, a donation of any amount is deeply appreciated!</p>

Our acknowledgment, prayers and gratitude go out to him and his family as he seeks to get justice and freedom after serving over 20 years of incarceration.  In Michael's words: ""It’s time for a change and The Green Life is the new revolution. I cannot think of any other movement that is crucial in order to sustain our communities, create meaningful lives and save the planet.”</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Xiuhtezcatl Martinez.  I am a 13 year old Environmental Activist and the voice and representative for the Boulder Colorado Earth Guardians Youth Group.  Our group is standing up for the survival of our generation by educating youth and adults about the state of the planet that we are inheriting, creating environmental campaigns, and taking them into action to create a sustainable, just healthy planet.  States and Countries around the world want to model what we are doing here in Boulder, by creating Earth Guardian Hubs in their communities.  The hubs will empower youth to have a positive impact on environmental issues that are directly affecting them where they live, and give them hope that their voice can make a difference.  Locally we have gotten pesticides out of parks, gotten deadly coal ash contained, helped get a fee on plastic bags and much more.

<h2>Basics</h2>
<div>Shift The Climate is a brother and sister duo, out to see the places and people affected by climate change and to present a solution based outlook to the world's biggest problem. You can visit <a href=""http://www.shifttheclimate.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">our website</a> to explore all we are up to. </div>
<h2>Who We are</h2>
<div>Kate and Sam are a brother/sister team living in Charlotte, NC. Their passion for the outdoors grew into a greater concern for the climate crisis that the planet faces. Together, they both felt that they could no longer sit on the side lines watching this happen. Shift is their chance to jump in head first.  </div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>How You're Helping</h2>
<div>We will be using the funds raised from this campaign to help us finance part one of Shift. This phase consists of a road trip around the U.S. where we hope to meet those most directly affected by climate change, and also those making the changes we, as a country, should be moving towards. We will be building an online resource for people to learn the facts of climate change and what they can to do to help combat it. We hope to foster an overall community of climate activist. Part one will culminate in a feature length documentary of our findings.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Donations will also go towards funding a Street Team. The Street Team is a youth movement to raise awareness of climate change in local communities through distribution of stickers, stencils, and other street art based medias. The Street Team will also include action packets which will outline a clear path for aspiring climate activist to take in order to create real change in their communities. We hope this will become a free resource on our <a href=""http://www.shifttheclimate.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">website.</a>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>We're diving into this project head first. Cutting the ties loose, and going for it. We want to make this happen and we need your help! We're breaking our funding down into a few categories. </div>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<ul>
<li>Travel Cost [$1,000]: We're traveling the country to meet, learn, and film those directly effected by climate change. A big chunk of funding will head towards all the cost we accrue during the trip. The basics, you know? Food, lodging, and travel cost. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Production Equipment [$1,000]: We've been filmmakers for a few years now, but we need a few extra items to pull this thing off. We need a new audio recording set up so we can make sure we capture people's stories effectively. We also would like a POV camera to help us capture the action in more incognito situations. </li>
<li>Street Team [$1,500]:This is the big one. We're really trying to pull off a movement here. We want to empower people in two ways. The first is awareness through a guerilla style campaign of stickers, stencils, and other street art mediums. The second is distributing an information packet detailing how you can create change on an individual level all the way to a city wide level. A great majority of our funding will go towards the street team as we would like to see this become a free resource. We hope that aspiring activist can sign up and receive their packets at no cost. This will be completely donor funded.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h3 class=""_mce_tagged_br"">What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to make donating worth everyone's while. Each donation will be critical, whether it is $10, $25 or $1,000. We have detailed all levels of donation perks below. Any extra promotional material will be distributed to our donors if available.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>A little more...</h2>
<p>Shift has been a dream in the making for many years. Kate and Sam have long been informed followers of climate change, and also of the climate movement. In the past year, they both came to the same realization: they wanted to be more involved. They both felt that they needed to be doing more, a lot more. Together they have a great combination of skill sets. Sam has a long history in <a href=""http://www.pcmporch.com/video/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video and film production</a> and Kate studies environmental history and received a research grant from Montana State University in 2011, to study at the Smithsonian Archives and National Academy of Science archives. Shift is the beginning of their dream to raise awareness surrounding climate change, and most importantly, to make it an approachable, tangible topic for all. </p>

Production Equipment [$1,000]: We've been filmmakers for a few years now, but we need a few extra items to pull this thing off. We need a new audio recording set up so we can make sure we capture people's stories effectively. We also would like a POV camera to help us capture the action in more incognito situations. 
Street Team [$1,500]:This is the big one. We're really trying to pull off a movement here. We want to empower people in two ways. The first is awareness through a guerilla style campaign of stickers, stencils, and other street art mediums. The second is distributing an information packet detailing how you can create change on an individual level all the way to a city wide level. A great majority of our funding will go towards the street team as we would like to see this become a free resource. We hope that aspiring activist can sign up and receive their packets at no cost. This will be completely donor funded.




 
What You Get
We want to make donating worth everyone's while. Each donation will be critical, whether it is $10, $25 or $1,000. We have detailed all levels of donation perks below. Any extra promotional material will be distributed to our donors if available.  
 


A little more...
Shift has been a dream in the making for many years. Kate and Sam have long been informed followers of climate change, and also of the climate movement. In the past year, they both came to the same realization: they wanted to be more involved. They both felt that they needed to be doing more, a lot more. Together they have a great combination of skill sets. Sam has a long history in video and film production and Kate studies environmental history and received a research grant from Montana State University in 2011, to study at the Smithsonian Archives and National Academy of Science archives. Shift is the beginning of their dream to raise awareness surrounding climate change, and most importantly, to make it an approachable, tangible topic for all. 
 


Can't Afford to Give?
That's ok! We know not everyone will be able to donate to the cause. If you can't make a financial donation at this time here are a few more ways to get involved.

While solar projects can provide many benefits to schools, they require time and effort to evaluate, approve, and manage. While many school administrators have an interest in going solar, they do not always have the time or resources to explore solar development.

Something is needed to help organize enthusiastic community members who are interested in exploring solar development on their local school, and to expand the people-hours and resources available to school administrators to forward solar project exploration and development. That's where the Solar Schools platform comes in.
THE SOLAR SCHOOLS PLATFORM
The Solar Schools platform will help parents and students connect and organize themselves around development of specific solar projects that increase renewable energy infrastructure in their community. We are building a bridge that connects local enthusiasm for renewable energy with the experts and resources they need to build the communities they desire.

Short Summary 

We are building a demonstration edible forest garden to inspire property owners to replace their lawns with perennial food systems at their homes, schools, churches, places of work, and municipalities. 

WHO?!






We are The Resiliency Institute, an educational nonprofit started in 2013 dedicated to teaching people in the suburbs about permaculture. We are a 501(c)(3) organization so your donations may be tax deductible. 
WHERE?!
In the suburbs of Chicago for now—but hopefully everyone will be inspired to do this in their own city or town!
WHAT?!
 “Perma—what?!?!” you say?
PERMACULTURE is “a philosophy of working with, rather than against nature; of protracted and thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless labor; and of looking at plants and animals in all their functions, rather than treating any area as a single product system."" - Bill Mollison, co-founder of permaculture.
PERMANENT + CULTURE = PERMACULTURE
We are using this philosophy to help create sustainable systems for daily living, land and community. 




Our goal is to put underutilized suburban land into production growing local, organic, nutrient dense food and to teach people the skills to harvest, prepare, preserve, and share the abundance.
   What We Need & What You Get To create a truly beautiful and INSPIRATIONAL place that will make everyone who visits want to grow an edible forest garden of their own, we need:
1)  PLANTS- LOTS AND LOTS OF PLANTS! $5,000  


2)  Educational materials: $6,500
Signage & Brochures—we need to educate visitors about what they are seeing.  This project will be part of the self guided sustainability tour on the Conservation Foundation property.  There is not always staffing available to give tours so we need to make sure that the information on how and why visitors can incorporate perennial edible landscaping into their own properties is provided.  We will also need materials to promote the project at outreach events we attend and to landowners that we visit or who contact us.
3)  Hardscaping Materials: $2,200

A drainage line to connect CSA wastewater directly into our system
An aesthetically pleasing materials depot to store compost, mulch, rocks, and other materials
Seating
Arbors and trellis
Bridges



We are using our AMAZING community of volunteers to help with installation and maintenance.
4-7% goes to Indiegogo and credit card fees, some to materials and postage for perks,  and anything else will be used to purchase plants & materials.  Any funds beyond our goal will be used toward programming and materials for future food forest installations.

The Impact

 
WHY?!

Replacing underutilized land with edible food forests will grow a local food system where everyone has access to local, healthy, organic, nutrient dense fruits, vegetables, nuts and herbs. People will experience the taste of fresh picked produce and reconnect with where food comes from. A scarcity mindset will be replaced with one of abundance and sharing.THE NEED:

In our suburban area there are over 84,000 (regionally 300,000)  people who are food insecure. They do not know how they will pay for their next meal.
Our local food pantry has experienced a 780% increase in need since 2008.
1,000’s of people living in food deserts don’t have access to local, organic, nutrient dense food.
There is a national health crisis of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease caused by poor diets based on easily accessible, cheap, low nutritionally valued, processed food.

THE RESOURCES:There are over 9,000 potential food producing acres available in our county and tens of thousands of acres regionally. Using this land to grow food forests can provide nourishing food for food insecure families and the greater suburban populations while regenerating soil and increasing biodiversity.
According to a NASA study, there are approximately 30 MILLION acres of LAWN in the US—that is the size of OHIO, making it the 4th largest UNPRODUCTIVE monoculture in our country.
Mowed lawns degrade ecosystems because they cannot support the diversity of life needed for healthy, resilient ecosystems.  The only thing supported by mowed turf grass is Canadian Geese.
Mowed lawns degrade and destroy soil when fertilizers and pesticides are used.  This kills soil organisms needed to support healthy plant life, and perpetuates a continuous cycle of nutrient depletion, disease, and artificial fertilization.
Mowed lawns use exorbitant amounts of resources, especially WATER—usually potable. 
Mowed lawns are the cause of over 5% of air pollution (US EPA), and the emissions of one gas mower are equivalent to eight vehicles. (Union of Concerned Scientists)
 Illinois is the number one contributor of phosphorous and nitrogen (lawn fertilizer) to the ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico. (Sierra Club)


Gardeners spill more fuel  every year than the Exxon Valdez (US EPA)

THE SOLUTION:



EDIBLE FOREST GARDENS - at the smaller residential scale - and FOOD FORESTS -at the larger community scale - are perennial based food production systems which, by design:

Grow local, organic, nutrient dense food, creating abundance and food security

Create vibrant community gathering spaces that encourage interaction, recreation, community building and sharing


Restore bio-diverse, resilient ecosystems


Build soil

Conserve natural resources

Reduce pollution by reducing the need for fossil fuels for fertilizers, pesticides, food processing and transportation 


Sequester carbon to help fight global warming
