<h2>INTRODUCING ASAP</h2>
<h3>Academics Stand Against Poverty. Insight and ideas to end poverty, ASAP.</h3>
<p>ASAP is a global network of scholars using research, teaching, and advocacy to help bring about the end of poverty. Founded in 2010, the ASAP network has chapters in Canada, Germany, India, Oceania, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US, with hundreds of members working and studying in universities, research centers, and NGOs worldwide. To learn more about ASAP, visit <a href=""http://academicsstand.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://academicsstand.org/</a> .</p>
<h2><strong>WHY ASAP, WHY DONATE, WHY NOW</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>We are launching a global advocacy campaign targeting one of the most powerful structural forces keeping people in poverty: illicit financial flows. </strong></h3>
<p>Illicit financial flows play a key role in perpetuating poverty. Every year, roughly <a href=""http://iff.gfintegrity.org/documents/dec2012Update/ExecSummary-Illicit_Financial_Flows_from_Developing_Countries_2001-2010-WEB.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$1 trillion are spirited out of developing economies through corruption, criminal activity, and tax evasion.</a> That means that for every dollar developing countries receive in foreign assistance, ten dollars go out. This massive theft is made possible by tax loopholes and a global network of tax havens. To read more about illicit financial flows, visit <a href=""http://www.gfintegrity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gfintegrity.org/</a> and <a href=""http://www.financialtransparency.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.financialtransparency.org/</a> .</p>
<p>ASAP has brought together a team of world-class scholars and NGO leaders, like <a href=""http://www.yale.edu/macmillan/globaljustice/pogge.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thomas Pogge</a> (Yale University) and <a href=""http://www.gfintegrity.org/content/view/16/137/#raymond"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Raymond Baker</a> (Global Financial Integrity) to craft a plan to curb illicit financial flows around the world, by closing down tax havens and bringing transparency to the global financial system.</p>
<p><strong>Right now,  we have an unprecedented opportunity to put those plans into action and put a stop to illicit financial flows.</strong></p>
<p>UN agencies and member states are negotiating <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/mdg.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a global agenda for poverty alleviation</a>, to be put into place in 2015, that will shape development priorities for the next two decades. Putting illicit financial flows on that agenda would catalyze global efforts to build a fair and transparent financial system.</p>
<p><strong>To influence the post-2015 agenda, we need your help.</strong></p>
<p>We need to put our proposal on the desks of UN decision makers before the end of the year; to do that, we need to raise $15,000 for an advocacy war chest. With that money, we can lobby UN agencies and member states and build an online campaign to build grassroots support for a fair, transparent financial system.</p>
<h2>WHERE YOUR DONATION WILL GO</h2>
<h3><strong>Every dollar helps. Here's where your donation will go:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>$1500 to build a campaign website</li>
<li>$5000 to edit and publish financial transparency policy proposal and distribute it amongst important UN agencies and member states</li>
<li>$6500 to cover transportation costs to bring ASAP team to high-level UN meetings</li>
<li>$2000 to pay researchers to respond to unfolding UN development policy process in lead-up to 2015</li>
</ul><h3><strong>ASAP is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and all donations will support our efforts to curb illicit financial flows.</strong></h3>
<p>The months leading up to 2015 are an indispensble opportunity to mobilize the international community to curb illicit financial flows, which are undermining the rule of law and security worldwide and keeping millions of people in poverty.</p>
<p>Please, donate today and join us in confronting the injustice woven into the global financial system and reforming it to ensure that people in developing countries retain what is rightfully theirs.</p>

Founded in 2010, the ASAP network has chapters in Canada, Germany, India, Oceania, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US, with hundreds of members working and studying in universities, research centers, and NGOs worldwide. To learn more about ASAP, visit http://academicsstand.org/ .
WHY ASAP, WHY DONATE, WHY NOW
We are launching a global advocacy campaign targeting one of the most powerful structural forces keeping people in poverty: illicit financial flows. 
Illicit financial flows play a key role in perpetuating poverty. Every year, roughly $1 trillion are spirited out of developing economies through corruption, criminal activity, and tax evasion. That means that for every dollar developing countries receive in foreign assistance, ten dollars go out. This massive theft is made possible by tax loopholes and a global network of tax havens. To read more about illicit financial flows, visit http://www.gfintegrity.org/ and http://www.financialtransparency.org/ .
ASAP has brought together a team of world-class scholars and NGO leaders, like Thomas Pogge (Yale University) and Raymond Baker (Global Financial Integrity) to craft a plan to curb illicit financial flows around the world, by closing down tax havens and bringing transparency to the global financial system.
Right now,  we have an unprecedented opportunity to put those plans into action and put a stop to illicit financial flows.
UN agencies and member states are negotiating a global agenda for poverty alleviation, to be put into place in 2015, that will shape development priorities for the next two decades. Putting illicit financial flows on that agenda would catalyze global efforts to build a fair and transparent financial system.
To influence the post-2015 agenda, we need your help.
We need to put our proposal on the desks of UN decision makers before the end of the year; to do that, we need to raise $15,000 for an advocacy war chest. With that money, we can lobby UN agencies and member states and build an online campaign to build grassroots support for a fair, transparent financial system.
WHERE YOUR DONATION WILL GO
Every dollar helps. Here's where your donation will go:

$1500 to build a campaign website
$5000 to edit and publish financial transparency policy proposal and distribute it amongst important UN agencies and member states
$6500 to cover transportation costs to bring ASAP team to high-level UN meetings
$2000 to pay researchers to respond to unfolding UN development policy process in lead-up to 2015
ASAP is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and all donations will support our efforts to curb illicit financial flows.
The months leading up to 2015 are an indispensble opportunity to mobilize the international community to curb illicit financial flows, which are undermining the rule of law and security worldwide and keeping millions of people in poverty.
Please, donate today and join us in confronting the injustice woven into the global financial system and reforming it to ensure that people in developing countries retain what is rightfully theirs.

<p>  Given these new <b>invasive technologies</b>, we believe that a technology which enables the average consumer to <b>regain their privacy</b> is imperative.  We must have confidence in the security of our financial and business information as more and more personal financial and business data is held in our phones.  Consider that all of the information in your wallet, on your phone or tablet is potential fodder for criminals, corporate espionage and other “prying eye” data surveillance personnel.  As we live our lives in a free society, we want to maintain control of who we are, where we are, and what digital activities we are engaged in without unknown persons watching or recording.  </p>
<p>  To mitigate these threats, we have begun a project by establishing a “roadmap” to guide our development efforts from proof of concept through product commercialization. This involves the development of a product that will receive a special treatment which will enhance the protective security of your electronic devices.  This treatment will provide an active blocking mechanism to impede unauthorized communications to and from your phone and wireless device (it also<br/>means you won’t get any calls or texts either).  Think of it as a ""Dead Zone"" or an electronic silencer.  So we stop the leaks and block the attacks.  As it has been said “You can’t hack what you can’t see.” or for our purposes “You can’t eavesdrop on a<br/>signal that isn’t there.” The “roadmap to success” includes several attributes<br/>that we believe will be needed for widespread acceptance and penetration into<br/>the marketplace.  First, the Dead Zone products need to be simple to use; secondly, there should be products manufactured for a variety of devices and environments; and lastly, should be able to be used with multiple electronic devices.</p>

<p><strong>MONITORING YOUR MOVEMENTS IN A SHOPPING MALL</strong></p>
<p><em>Update November 23, 2011<span>  </span></em> </p>
<p>""Many of the news media outlets here in Southern California were making a big deal today about the report that the Promenade Mall in Temecula had started a system where they can track where cell phones are moving about inside the mall.  Of course, the mall managers don't care about the cell phones -- what they are tracking is the owners of the cell phones.</p>
<p>The news media immediately questioned if this was an invasion of<br/>privacy?  No, it's not, says the mall.  No data is being ripped from<br/>the cell phones, no phone numbers or emails are being detected, but they are<br/>just using the electronics of the cell phones to watch where patrons move about<br/>in their mall.</p>
<p>Actually this is a good idea as it could help mall designers do a<br/>better job of creating and managing shopping mall layouts.  But it could<br/>also cause some problems in the future for shoppers, and here are some<br/>examples:</p>
<p>If the mall detects that we go to malls first for the food courts<br/>or for the coffee shops, they might bury the food courts and the coffee shops<br/>deeper inside the mall so we will have to pass more stores to get there. <br/>The same goes for restrooms.  And if the mall discovers that we are going<br/>to shoe stores first, the shoe stores might be moved to interior mall<br/>locations.</p>
<p>If the mall detects that we are not stopping to look at the<br/>advertising signs and banners inside the open spaces of the mall, they might<br/>change the walkways into some sort of maze that would force us to look at the<br/>signs and banners as we go through the walkways.</p>
<p>If the mall detects that we walk quickly past certain stores, the<br/>mall managers might want to take a closer look at those stores to find out<br/>why.  And if the mall detects that we are lurking outside the fronts of<br/>certain stores but not going in, the mall managers might ask Victoria's Secret<br/>to cover up more of its models.  (Admit it, you knew that was coming.)</p>
<p>The mall might also be able to determine where it needs more<br/>cleaning services, security services, and seats -- or where it should remove<br/>seating areas.  If the mall determines that a particular store is getting<br/>a lot of foot traffic it might raise the store's rent.  If the mall finds<br/>a particular store gets a lot of traffic but that store is near a mall door,<br/>the mall might move that store further from the door so more traffic will pass<br/>by other stores.</p>
<p>And if the mall wants its shoppers to stay in part of its mall<br/>longer, it might offer some form of entertainment to keep us there.  And<br/>if the mall finds we are walking at a slow pace in other sections, it might<br/>decide to install a moving sidewalk.</p>
<p>This kind of research could be done the old-fashioned way, with<br/>managers watching and taking notes.  But high tech makes this kind of<br/>research easy.  If you don't like the idea of tracking your cell phone signals,<br/>the malls could put RFID tracking chips in the shopping bags that the stores<br/>use and get similar information.""</p>

<h3>Use of Funds and Project Risks</h3>
<p></p>
<p>You can take control back!  With your support and our development team working together, we can neutralize these threats.  We have established three different development paths to pursue to increase our chances of success. Of course we may not be able to find the ideal material mix which will provide all of the properties we require.  This would result in the necessity of another project.</p>
<p>We might not be able to manufacture a viable system at a low enough entry point for everyone.  This may make the Dead Zone products non commercially viable in the future.  We believe that this project merits a Crowd Sourcing approach to bring an affordable and easily used solution to the general public.</p>
  We work in the materials industry and therefore geopolitical or other sourcing challenges may make completion of the project impractical.  If we don't reach our goal of $14.800 all product based perks are in jeopardy and we may not be able to fulfill them if we haven't received the funds required for successful product development. <br/><br/><br/>

This involves the development of a product that will receive a special treatment which will enhance the protective security of your electronic devices.  This treatment will provide an active blocking mechanism to impede unauthorized communications to and from your phone and wireless device (it alsomeans you won’t get any calls or texts either).  Think of it as a ""Dead Zone"" or an electronic silencer.  So we stop the leaks and block the attacks.  As it has been said “You can’t hack what you can’t see.” or for our purposes “You can’t eavesdrop on asignal that isn’t there.” The “roadmap to success” includes several attributesthat we believe will be needed for widespread acceptance and penetration intothe marketplace.  First, the Dead Zone products need to be simple to use; secondly, there should be products manufactured for a variety of devices and environments; and lastly, should be able to be used with multiple electronic devices.

Below are other news reports of tracking activities.  
  Police in These 15 States Use Tracking Devices to Collect 
Data from Cell Phones
Jun. 12, 2014, 4:05 PM""A new map from the ACLU shows 15 states where local law enforcement is tracking cell phone data. Local and state law enforcement in 15 states use fake cell towers, also known as ""stingrays,"" according to a map released by the American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday. Stingrays are used to track the location oftargeted phones, and can also intercept phone calls and text messages.
According to the ACLU, when these devices are used to track a suspect, stingrays inadvertently track the information of bystanders' phones. Stingrays can also send electronic signals into private residences, learning data about the owners and locations of phones within the buildings, which worries privacy advocates.
Besides the 15 states named in the ACLU's report, the ACLU also listed 12 U.S. government agencies that use stingrays, including the National Security Agency and the U.S. Army.  The ACLU's new map comes just two days after an activist filed a lawsuit against the Chicago Police Department, demanding to know how the city uses its own stingray devices.""

This article, which is a little older, makes one wonder what are the current tracking capabilities.
MONITORING YOUR MOVEMENTS IN A SHOPPING MALL
Update November 23, 2011   
""Many of the news media outlets here in Southern California were making a big deal today about the report that the Promenade Mall in Temecula had started a system where they can track where cell phones are moving about inside the mall.  Of course, the mall managers don't care about the cell phones -- what they are tracking is the owners of the cell phones.
The news media immediately questioned if this was an invasion ofprivacy?  No, it's not, says the mall.  No data is being ripped fromthe cell phones, no phone numbers or emails are being detected, but they arejust using the electronics of the cell phones to watch where patrons move aboutin their mall.
Actually this is a good idea as it could help mall designers do abetter job of creating and managing shopping mall layouts.  But it couldalso cause some problems in the future for shoppers, and here are someexamples:
If the mall detects that we go to malls first for the food courtsor for the coffee shops, they might bury the food courts and the coffee shopsdeeper inside the mall so we will have to pass more stores to get there. The same goes for restrooms.  And if the mall discovers that we are goingto shoe stores first, the shoe stores might be moved to interior malllocations.
If the mall detects that we are not stopping to look at theadvertising signs and banners inside the open spaces of the mall, they mightchange the walkways into some sort of maze that would force us to look at thesigns and banners as we go through the walkways.
If the mall detects that we walk quickly past certain stores, themall managers might want to take a closer look at those stores to find outwhy.  And if the mall detects that we are lurking outside the fronts ofcertain stores but not going in, the mall managers might ask Victoria's Secretto cover up more of its models.  (Admit it, you knew that was coming.)
The mall might also be able to determine where it needs morecleaning services, security services, and seats -- or where it should removeseating areas.  If the mall determines that a particular store is gettinga lot of foot traffic it might raise the store's rent.  If the mall findsa particular store gets a lot of traffic but that store is near a mall door,the mall might move that store further from the door so more traffic will passby other stores.
And if the mall wants its shoppers to stay in part of its malllonger, it might offer some form of entertainment to keep us there.  Andif the mall finds we are walking at a slow pace in other sections, it mightdecide to install a moving sidewalk.
This kind of research could be done the old-fashioned way, withmanagers watching and taking notes.  But high tech makes this kind ofresearch easy.  If you don't like the idea of tracking your cell phone signals,the malls could put RFID tracking chips in the shopping bags that the storesuse and get similar information.""

Here is an update: The Malls “Says it has turned off the tracking, Butdid they? Knowing the new face book location based ads, their are organization which have develop additional methods and programs to track you. And where else is this technology being used without our knowledge? Retail surveillance is happening. Where else is it happening?

Retail Stores Are Tracking Your Cell Phone

Retailers are now snooping on your shopping habits with cutting edgetechnology to follow your whereabouts inside stores, CNN's Pamela Brownreports.
""The in-store analytics makes it possible for retailers to understand things likewhere they go, where they stop. And ultimately how all of that translates tosales at the register,"" says Tim Callan, Chief Marketing Officer, RetailNext. Upscale department chain Nordstrom recently ended a test program gathering pings from Wi-Fi signals on customer's smart phones as they browsed through the store.
Some were outraged after learning about the in-store surveillance. ""Way over the line,"" one consumer wrote on Facebook. What do you think? Is this fair or have stores gone too far in terms of privacy?

And from  RetailNext own web site:
“The most advanced in-store analytics solution available.”
 
In-store analytics is a collection of systems working together to organize, analyze, and visualize massive amounts of diverse retail data.”

Use of Funds and Project Risks

You can take control back!  With your support and our development team working together, we can neutralize these threats.  We have established three different development paths to pursue to increase our chances of success. Of course we may not be able to find the ideal material mix which will provide all of the properties we require.  This would result in the necessity of another project.
We might not be able to manufacture a viable system at a low enough entry point for everyone.  This may make the Dead Zone products non commercially viable in the future.  We believe that this project merits a Crowd Sourcing approach to bring an affordable and easily used solution to the general public.
  We work in the materials industry and therefore geopolitical or other sourcing challenges may make completion of the project impractical.  If we don't reach our goal of $14.800 all product based perks are in jeopardy and we may not be able to fulfill them if we haven't received the funds required for successful product development.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When I got the job as innovation manager at one the UK's largest children's charities I learned that you can have an important purpose, great ideas, and even the best technology but unless people are inspired, and have support and confidence nothing happens. I've been freelancing since 2012 helping individuals and organisations think differently to get better results. I’ve written a best selling book ‘The Innovation Workout’ and I speak at conferences around the world on creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>I want as many people as possible to build their confidence and know-how to achieve the results they want. I believe that a regular dose of motivation, expertise and inspiration leads to greater happiness, fulfilment and achievement. </p>
<p><i>""Lucy Gower has become my go-to person for inspiration on innovation""</i> Deanna Wolf, Chair of the IoF Scotland Trusts, Statutory and Foundations Special Interest Group.</p>
<p>I've developed lots of tools to help people get better results. For example the innovation animals activity to help you identify your strengths and work with others to get the results you want faster. You can take the 2 minute quiz to <a href=""https://www.lucidity.org.uk/animal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">find your innovation animal here. </a>  (I'm a squirrel!) </p>
<p>My campaign is to fund the costs of setting up the Lucidity Network, an online network offering learning, group support and 1:1 coaching at a super reduced rate. All this combined with a programme of guaranteed to be enjoyable, non-awkward networking events so that I can give more people the confidence to think differently, make change happen and achieve better results.</p>
<p>To join the Lucidity Network you pay a monthly subscription. (I'm offering a special introductory price of £19.57 per month and there's no minimum contract or anything like that - we're not a gym!)  If you are a member, each month you'll receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘How to be Brilliant’ A4 workbook, exclusive to members to download on a specific topic, for example: improving your creativity, being more resilient, increasing your confidence or courage to challenge your manager. It includes case studies and practical tips. The monthly topic is based on my experience of seeing what holds people back and feedback from members. </li>
<li>A 60 minute webinar for more in-depth learning on the topic of the month.</li>
<li>A 60 minute Q&amp;A group webinar to answer any questions on the topic of the month.</li>
<li>An online network space to ask questions, share information and support each other.</li>
<li>A quarterly networking event, in London to start with - with people you will really want to talk to.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, Lucidity Network members (who sign up for 4 months or more) get access to 1:1 coaching to help work through specific challenges at a super reduced price (either face-to-face, phone or Skype depending on location) either from me or one of our qualified coaches.</p>
<p>I know from my work that coaching makes a big difference. If you're not convinced see what those smart people at <a href=""https://hbr.org/2009/01/what-can-coaches-do-for-you"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harvard Business Review have to say about it here. </a></p>
<p><i>“I would recommend coaching to anyone who wants to overcome any personal inhibitions that are holding them back from achieving more. It is also good for challenging yourself if you are in a senior position and want to continue developing.”</i> Esther Preston, Director of Income Generation, Ashgate Hospicecare.</p>
<p>Like anything the more you put in the more you'll get out. All I ask is that you spend 2 hours each month putting yourself first. I guarantee you’ll feel re-invigorated and ready to face whatever your challenges are.   </p>
<p>I’ve seen through the work I do that people can achieve huge amounts with a little bit of support. So many people are held back from reaching their goals because they don’t have a support network, or people they can ask for help who can give candid feedback and cheer them on to success.</p>

<p>I'm planning to launch the Lucidity Network in April. (This is when all the membership-related perks start) If I don’t reach the goal you'll get your money back. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’ve seen from the work that I do with individuals and teams that a small amount of support can make a huge difference to someone’s confidence and their ability to succeed.</p>
<p>For example Steph and her team who used the tools gained on a training day to smash their income targets; Beth who after coaching with Lucidity works less hours and has doubled her turnover; and Iain who upped his confidence and profile and is now in a new role!  </p>
<p>Don't just take my word for it Check out <a href=""https://www.lucidity.org.uk/case-stories/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">what some of the people I've helped have to say.</a> </p>
<p>Through the Lucidity Network you can be part of helping more people have greater confidence to achieve better results. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>What if no-one joins</strong>? The success of the Lucidity Network relies on a critical mass of people joining.  I’ve already asked my current clients and key contacts what they think of the concept. They think it’s a good idea and have pledged to join and encourage others to do the same. Many of the perks for this campaign are membership offers for the Lucidity Network, therefore if we reach our target it means a critical mass of people will have signed up. If we are successful at raising the initial £10,247 we need to get started, we have a strategy to show the benefit of the Lucidity Network to attract additional funders and members. If we don't reach our target - then you get your money back. </p>

In addition to the above, Lucidity Network members (who sign up for 4 months or more) get access to 1:1 coaching to help work through specific challenges at a super reduced price (either face-to-face, phone or Skype depending on location) either from me or one of our qualified coaches.
I know from my work that coaching makes a big difference. If you're not convinced see what those smart people at Harvard Business Review have to say about it here. 
“I would recommend coaching to anyone who wants to overcome any personal inhibitions that are holding them back from achieving more. It is also good for challenging yourself if you are in a senior position and want to continue developing.” Esther Preston, Director of Income Generation, Ashgate Hospicecare.
Like anything the more you put in the more you'll get out. All I ask is that you spend 2 hours each month putting yourself first. I guarantee you’ll feel re-invigorated and ready to face whatever your challenges are.   
I’ve seen through the work I do that people can achieve huge amounts with a little bit of support. So many people are held back from reaching their goals because they don’t have a support network, or people they can ask for help who can give candid feedback and cheer them on to success.
Check out what Stephanie Harvey, Head of Fundraising at Providence Row has to say about the Lucidity Network.  

I believe that the Lucidity Network has real potential to help thousands of people achieve more in their roles and be more confident, independent and happier for very little financial cost. I'm so confident that, if you put in the effort required and it doesn't make a difference within 3 months then I'll give you your money back. Please help me create and be a part of the Lucidity Network. 

What We Need and What You Get
The Lucidity Network needs a total of £10,247 to get off the ground. Broadly that breaks down into.

In return for your money we’ve got some great perks (See to the right for more information on each perk!) for you including;

£12 - A set of 8 limited edition innovation animal postcards. You can find out your innovation animal by doing the 2 minute innovation animal quiz here. 

£19 - A little taster - 1 month membership of the Lucidity Network.
£27 - A signed copy of the best selling Innovation Workout - with a specific message of your choice.
£59 - A limited edition A4 innovation animal print - there are 8 to choose from.
£75 - A medium taster - 4 month membership of the Lucidity Network (includes a signed copy of the Innovation Workout super reduced prices on 1:1 coaching and a networking event) This introductory price is guaranteed for life.
£110 - A 6 month membership of the Lucidity Network  (includes a signed copy of the Innovation Workout, super reduced prices on 1:1 coaching and 2 networking events) This introductory price is guaranteed for life. 
£220 - One year membership of the Lucidity Network (benefits as above with 4 networking events). This introductory price is guaranteed for life.  
£440 - One year joint membership of the Lucidity Network (benefits as above for two people plus a 'how to' guide for the innovation animals kit).  This introductory price is also guaranteed for life.
£1,000 - One year corporate Lucidity Network membership (price guaranteed for life for up to 5 members) If you manage a team this could be a very cost effective way to support their development. If you don't manage a team - share this page with your manager! 
£10,000 - Sponsor the Lucidity Network and be part of the creation of a network and community achieving amazing results. 

I'm planning to launch the Lucidity Network in April. (This is when all the membership-related perks start) If I don’t reach the goal you'll get your money back. 

The Impact
I’ve seen from the work that I do with individuals and teams that a small amount of support can make a huge difference to someone’s confidence and their ability to succeed.
For example Steph and her team who used the tools gained on a training day to smash their income targets; Beth who after coaching with Lucidity works less hours and has doubled her turnover; and Iain who upped his confidence and profile and is now in a new role!  
Don't just take my word for it Check out what some of the people I've helped have to say. 
Through the Lucidity Network you can be part of helping more people have greater confidence to achieve better results. 

Risks & Challenges
What if no-one joins? The success of the Lucidity Network relies on a critical mass of people joining.  I’ve already asked my current clients and key contacts what they think of the concept. They think it’s a good idea and have pledged to join and encourage others to do the same. Many of the perks for this campaign are membership offers for the Lucidity Network, therefore if we reach our target it means a critical mass of people will have signed up. If we are successful at raising the initial £10,247 we need to get started, we have a strategy to show the benefit of the Lucidity Network to attract additional funders and members. If we don't reach our target - then you get your money back.

<div>The Proposal will allow anyone using an iPad to create a proposal for goods or services before leaving the site with the client (to include dealer pricing sheets) giving the client a professional PDF with a full scope of work and list of work to be done. Gone are the days of waiting 24-48 hours for a quote/estimate/proposal from your electrician, contractor or perhaps distributor! For the advanced user it will offer importing of dealer pricing sheets in .xls, .xlsx and .csv file formats (parsed directly within the app).

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are two guys who were sitting around talking about ""wouldn't it be nice if..."" and decided to do something about it. Josh and Ben are childhood best friends who have always been very engaged in technology. Ben chose the route of teaching himself software programming at home starting in middle school and continuing from there, and Josh decided to dedicate his higher learning to technology in attending Full Sail University in Florida. We decided that instead of sitting there talking about what needs to come out for our devices, we needed to step up to the plate. So the talking stopped, and action began. This has been an incredibly rewarding endeavor for us both, the concept of the app has evolved from a minimalist app, to a fully featured app that offers everything that is lacking on the market today. And now we're on IndieGoGo! This is where we seek your support and look to actually make this happen. We both want to thank you in advance for any support financially or socially in telling others about us. We are extremely excited that we have gotten to this stage and look forward to bringing this to market.<br/></p>

<h3><strong>VH-80SE is a bilateral laser measuring device</strong></h3>
<p>VH-80SE shoots two pulses of laser light from two sources in opposite directions and measures the amount of time it takes for each pulse to bounce back to its accompanied sensors. Since light moves at a constant, VH-80SE can calculate the distance between itself and the targets with high accuracy.</p>

<p>VH-80SE is a class II laser which is harmless to the human skin, except the eyes. Always be careful with eyes and lasers!</p>

<div>VH-80SE runs on 2 AAA batteries. While rechargeable lithium-ion was considered at development, two factors had us decide on the former: first, applying cell batteries allows VH-80SE from physically sizing up. and second, considering the environment for measurements particularly in the fields, finding an electric outlet and waiting to recharge the device seemed less appealing than quickly swapping to fresh cell batteries.</div>
<div> </div>

<p>VH-80SE uses Bluetooth 4.0, also known as Bluetooth Low Energy, which ensures an immediate and stable Bluetooth connection with extremely low energy use. That's why it was possible to have the Bluetooth connection run consistently on VH-80SE. So you only have to connect from your smart device, instead of fumbling with both devices trying to run the signal at the same time for synchronization.</p>

</div></div>","In 2017, VH-80 was born thanks to your support. We received $931,152 in funds from 5,042 backers in 85 countries from Indiegogo, and all of them shipped. 


We've received a lot of feedback selling over 20,000 products, and we've done a big upgrade to reflect these feedbacks. From now on, let's see what's upgraded!
 
 



 
VH-80SE is a bilateral laser measuring device
VH-80SE shoots two pulses of laser light from two sources in opposite directions and measures the amount of time it takes for each pulse to bounce back to its accompanied sensors. Since light moves at a constant, VH-80SE can calculate the distance between itself and the targets with high accuracy.
 
 

 From ancient footsteps to modern laser technology, the measurement tool went through many transformations. But, one factor never changed: the necessity to start from 0 to your destination. 

In most cases, the measurer must travel with the tool as well. It's something we may take for granted, a common-sense process. But is it?
 
 
The Movement Efficiency

VH-80SE means you can measure the distance between two points by positioning yourself anywhere along the line of measurement. In complicated working environments, when you need more than two hands or an extra body or two, and there are obstacles in your way, VH-80SE eliminates all of these hassles.
 
 
 3 values at once


Two laser diodes mean VH-80SE can take three measurements per single action: the left, right, and total combined. Therefore, when measuring multiple lengths, the advantages of using VH-80SE is exponentially increased, reducing your moves by a factor of three.
VH-80SE's measurement covers a total of 80 meters(262 ft). That's the length of a soccer field. How fast can you run across the field and back to retrieve your tape measure? Get it done in a second with VH-80SE.
 
 
The Time Saved is Incomparable

You can save significant time by effectively reducing your need to travel to various reference points required by one-directional devices.
Being free in position also means highly improved quality in safety and mobility. Not having to crouch to the floor or set on a ladder may seem like a minor improvement for a single measurement, but often we are measuring more than one length.
 
 
Safety is Always Rule No.1

VH-80SE really makes it comfortable when you have to repeatedly get down or constantly move the ladder to travel across space. We are hoping that VH-80SE can help and revive the passion in folks who have been shy from working on new projects because of physical discomfort or inconvenience as well. So that's some very little changes VH-80SE can bring to your life. 
 

 
 

 
As a laser distance measuring device, VH-80SE is capable of handling a variety of operations and works simultaneously with a smart device application for extended functions.

For a starter, VH-80SE is a bilateral laser distance measurer, but yes, it can also function in a single direction as well. While the bilateral setting is the default, you can easily switch to a single laser measurement setting, measured from the base or front.
VH-80SE has a total of 5 internal auto calculation modes for your convenience:
 
 
Continuous Measurement

In Continuous Measurement mode, VH-80SE measures at a set time interval providing live change along with your movement. Since VH-80SE takes the left, right, and total value simultaneously, this mode is incredibly helpful in finding midpoints or sectioning.
 
 
Area

By acquiring two values in a row, VH-80SE can quickly calculate the Area of your space. The movement efficiency of VH-80SE is most highlighted by equations like area and volume because you can acquire the necessary values by just turning your wrist once, instead of traveling and crisscrossing the space.
 
 
Volume

VH-80SE can acquire the Volume of space with three consecutive measurements. Like the area mode, VH-80SE is powerful for these occasions. With three flicks of the wrist, it's incredibly easy to finish this task as well.
 
 
Pythagorean Equation

Pythagorean Theorem Mode makes an indirect measurement by measuring two sides of a triangle to acquire the third. This is most helpful when you need to measure lengths that are large and in view.
 
 

 

 
Try Bluetooth connectivity with VH-80SE and you can control your device with your smartphone. Set the direction, function, and unit you want to measure conveniently and press the Measure button to measure the distance through a smartphone. And you no longer have to take notes of the measurements uncomfortably.
 

 
From now on, I'm going to introduce you to even more groundbreaking parts of the VH-80 M&S application. You can make constructive plans very quickly by using the data you measured and the photos you took through the app.
 

 
Quotation Mode automatically calculates how many resources you need. You don't have to find the formula on the internet and calculate it in your head.
When selecting materials such as paint, paper, tile, or wood for example the required paint volume, area of paper, and a number of tiles are automatically calculated, further enhancing the usability of the VH-80SE. Now, you can look like one of the pros.
 



 

 


As it is a special edition this time, we prepared two color options. Dusty Pink and Sage Green colors are clearly different from existing tools. Choose the color fits your best.

 
 
 


 

VH-80SE is a class II laser which is harmless to the human skin, except the eyes. Always be careful with eyes and lasers!

 
VH-80SE runs on 2 AAA batteries. While rechargeable lithium-ion was considered at development, two factors had us decide on the former: first, applying cell batteries allows VH-80SE from physically sizing up. and second, considering the environment for measurements particularly in the fields, finding an electric outlet and waiting to recharge the device seemed less appealing than quickly swapping to fresh cell batteries.
 

VH-80SE uses Bluetooth 4.0, also known as Bluetooth Low Energy, which ensures an immediate and stable Bluetooth connection with extremely low energy use. That's why it was possible to have the Bluetooth connection run consistently on VH-80SE. So you only have to connect from your smart device, instead of fumbling with both devices trying to run the signal at the same time for synchronization.
 
Know anyone who'd like VH-80SE?
 

 
 

VH-80SE is a perfect gift for everyone who engages in projects involving house remodeling, interior design, exhibition design, home improvement, and anything more involved with building something new.
Let your friends and family know about VH-80SE!
 
 

 

The VH-80SE is fully designed and ready for production. It has already accumulated production know-how by producing more than 20,000 VH-80 since 2018 and based on this, it is possible to produce products stably.
Firmware Upgrade is completed, and we are conducting final tests before we go into the manufacturing stage. Let's check how the production is ready. We will be continually updating the gallery during the campaign on any tweaks or news on the product along with our Update Tab.

<p>The £99 price was achieved by creating a design that merged together the motion system and frame of the printer whilst keeping the part count to a minimum. This way we can offer high quality components but for a far lower price.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that our margins are low, so we need your support to order large enough quantities to make the AXIS 3D Printer a success - but we will deliver and our pledge goal is very realistic for doing so!</p>

<p>Our unique motion system merges the frame, print platform and gantry to work together to create perfectly rigid and parallel motion. The folded metal edges reinforce the parts themselves whilst also providing a curved surface for linear guides to latch onto.</p>
<p>The linear guides themselves are made from HDPE (High Density Polyethylene), an incredibly rigid material with an extremely low co-efficient of friction resulting in incredibly smooth motion.</p>
<p>Furthermore the kit also includes PTFE grease for the contact between the linear guides and the metal frame to really achieve the smoothest possible motion.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As with any crowdfunding project there comes an element of risk, however this would now be our third time launching a project and we've learnt so much along the way and over come many obstacles that we're more than confident that we can not only deliver on time but to a high standard also.</p>
<p>The AXIS 3D printer was born out of the idea of an affordable £99 desktop 3D printer kit that could be both fun, useful and informative. This price point presents a number of challenges however we have a lot of faith in our team, suppliers and distributors to make this project a success and deliver the best possible AXIS 3D printer.</p>
</div></div>","Yes, that's right!
3D Printing is an amazing technology but remains difficult and expensive for the average person to use - we now aim to change this.
The AXIS 3D Printer is one of the most affordable 3D Printers ever made and perfect for anyone keen to dive into the futuristic world of desktop 3D Printing, without having to break the bank!
Our printer is based on open-source technology with tried and tested industry standard components designed to work right, first time.

The £99 price was achieved by creating a design that merged together the motion system and frame of the printer whilst keeping the part count to a minimum. This way we can offer high quality components but for a far lower price.
It's worth mentioning that our margins are low, so we need your support to order large enough quantities to make the AXIS 3D Printer a success - but we will deliver and our pledge goal is very realistic for doing so!


The AXIS 3D printer has a spec sheet to rival many of its higher priced counterparts and at £99 you're paying less than 1 pence per CM ³ of build space!
Thousands of hours of development and testing has gone in to make sure that the AXIS 3D printer functions as intended, again and again.
Furthermore a finalised design with components already selected are ready to order as soon as the campaign ends.


 Kickstarter's 3D Printer Torture Test 
 
 
Use the AXIS 3D Printer to print virtually any plastic object from toys and models to more practical items ranging from bike grips to shower heads! Explore the full range of possibilities on the popular model sharing site myminifactory.com.
Or take things further with the free and easy to use design software TinkerCAD to print your own unique objects!
Mt Mini Factory and TinkerCAD 

The AXIS 3D Printer is shipped as an easy to assemble kit with a very high quality online build manual with high-res images and easy to follow steps that break down the entire assembly process into easy to understand stages. Plus you also have the ability to comment under each and every step in case you get stuck.
The Assembly process should be half the fun, and give you an in-depth look at how your 3D Printer goes together and works, knowledge that will come in handy later for upgrades and maintenance.

A massive online community, easy maintenance, affordable off the shelf parts and entirely hackable are just some of the things that open-source technology provides.
The AXIS 3D Printer runs on the latest version of the very popular Marlin Firmware and works with the vast majority of industry standard software.

The AXIS 3D Printer is also compatible with a number of other very standard 3d printer hardware, ranging from hotends, nozzles, sensors, build-plates, and much more!
Also, the custom parts designed by us will have all of their manufacturing blueprints available for free download from our website after the campaign ends.


 

Advanced automatic bed-levelling comes as standard on the AXIS 3D Printer, meaning a perfect first layer each and every time.
The 300x200x200mm (12x8x8inch) build volume gives you plenty of space to bring your ideas to life, that's less than 1 pence for every CM³ of build space!
A steel and aluminium construction means a very solid and vibration free machine that will just keep on performing even after thousands of hours of printing!

 
The 24V power supply provides the AXIS 3D Printer with super quick heat-up times and smooth motion.
A steel drive gear grips firmly onto the filament that results in extreme precision over the flow of plastic through the hotend.
The all metal hotend can get to temperatures of up to 270 degrees Celsius, perfect for printing the vast majority of materials.



Our unique motion system merges the frame, print platform and gantry to work together to create perfectly rigid and parallel motion. The folded metal edges reinforce the parts themselves whilst also providing a curved surface for linear guides to latch onto.
The linear guides themselves are made from HDPE (High Density Polyethylene), an incredibly rigid material with an extremely low co-efficient of friction resulting in incredibly smooth motion.
Furthermore the kit also includes PTFE grease for the contact between the linear guides and the metal frame to really achieve the smoothest possible motion.
 


The brains of the AXIS 3D Printer is the all in one MKS GEN_L control board running the latest version of the open-source Marlin firmware.
The stock drivers are the strong and reliable A4988 chips that control the motion of 4 full sized NEMA 17 stepper motors. We're also including a spare A4988 stepper driver too.
The power supply is an external 24V 4A brick suitable for both 110V and 230V mains outlets.

Upgrade electronics include an LCD display with click wheel control, a beefy external MOSFET for controlling the heated bed and the silent TMC2208 stepper drivers.
The Octoprint upgrades includes a Raspberry Pi camera and we're recommending to use it with the powerful Raspberry Pi 3B+ (sold separately).


Expand the standard capabilities of the AXIS 3D Printer by adding the following plug and play upgrades. You can mix and match any combination of upgrades or add them all for the ultimate experience!   
The Power Pack is our most recommended upgrade that will give you the most rounded experience of the AXIS 3D Printer.
 Control the AXIS 3D Printer without a PC connection; pre-heat the hotends and tweak settings like temperature and print speed - mid-print!
Carbon fiber, glow in the dark and wood objects are shown as an example of whats possible, they were printed on the Proforge 2S
The included set of 5 hard wearing steel nozzles (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8mm) can be used for better resistance to more abrasive materials like carbon fibre, woodfil and glow-in-the-dark filaments.

Also included are two roles of PLA filament (250G each), a silicone cover for your hotend to keep it clean and provide better targetted air flow and a pack of 5 spare brass nozzles on top of the already included 0.4mm nozzle.
What's included:

LCD Screen
SD Card
PLA Sample Roll (x2)
Silicone Hotend Cover
Brass Nozzles - 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8mm
Steel Nozzles - 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8mm
 

Another recommended upgrade is the FlexPlate, a flexible spring steel sheet with our custom print surface that makes prints, both small and large, easy and hassle free to remove from the platform.
It fixes onto the platform with the help of 9 super strength high-temp resistant magnets.

What's included:

Flexplate
Print Surface
Magnet Pack (x9)
 

The heated bed helps your print's first layer adhere better to the platform and is an absolute must if you intend on printing high temp materials like ABS.
Our heated bed is a high quality aluminium platform with an integrated copper heater trace. It reaches temperatures of up to 110 degrees Celsius and is controlled through a beefy external MOSFET.
The platform is powered by a dedicated independent 24V power supply.
What included:

Aluminium Heated Platform (Pre-Wired with Thermistor)
Large External MOSFET
Dedicated Independent 24V Power Supply
 

The stock X/Y axis A4988 motor drivers on the control board are upgraded with the powerful and silent TMC2208 drivers.
With these upgrades the printing noise is reduced by up to 50%, this upgrade is a must if you expect to be running your printer in a quiet environment.
What's included:
Three TMC2208 Stepper Drivers (2 for x/y Axis + 1 Spare) 

Double the fun and the capability of your AXIS 3D Printer with this easy to use dual extrusion upgrade.
Two materials are printed via a Y shaped Splitter. When a material is done printing the extruder pulls it back out of the hotend and through the Splitter. Then the other extruder pushes the second material in through the other side of the Splitter to be printed with.


The Capabilities of Dual Extrusion
With the Dual Extruder upgrade you are able to print together materials with different properties and create dynamic parts like this hinge:
This hinge is shown as an example of what's possible with dual extrusion, it was printed on the Proforge 2S.
Dual extrusion can also be used to create geometries that would otherwise be impossible to print, but with the aid of a dissolvable support material like PVA we can do this:
This model is shown as an example of what's possible, it was printed on the Proforge 2S.
What's Included:

Extruder Kit
NEMA 17 Stepper Motor
Spool Holder
Stepper Driver (A4988)
PTFE Tubing (x2)
Splitter Kit
High Tolerance PTFE Tubing
Cables and Fasteners
 

Make wires a thing of the past and control your AXIS 3D Printer via Wi-Fi. Effortlessly start, stop and monitor prints when away from home or whilst your printer sits in a different room.
The interface is the open-source Octoprint which is controlled via most web browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox etc.
The system itself runs on the powerful Raspberry Pi 3B+ (not included in the upgrade but available from webstore - you may already own one or be able to source one locally).
What's Included:

Pi Cam
Pi Cam Case
Pi Cam Ribbon Cable
USB Wi-Fi Adapter
Micro SD Card
USB Power Converter
Fasteners


Before printing, a model needs to be processed by a ""slicing software"", where a 3D model (.stl file) is converted into a .gcode file that the printer can read.
The Makertech Edition of CURA, is an open-source slicing software with settings tuned to work seamlessly with the AXIS 3D printer. It is available for both Windows and MAC.
Download here.


Randomized testing of the metal parts allows us to make sure that the parts coming off of our assembly lines are with in specification.
All of the electronics under go rigorous testing also and are marked with a QC sticker after inspection before being packaged, ensuring that you receive the AXIS 3D Printer as we intended.

In the slim case you do receive a faulty part or one that was damaged in transit or one that was even missing we'll send out a replacement for you right away for up to an entire year after your purchase!


**Conversions from Pounds (£) to US Dollars ($) and Euros (€) are an approximation and may vary when placing the final order.**   
After successfully fulfilling two 3D Printer Kickstarter's in the past two years we're quite confident of meeting our deadlines and getting your AXIS 3D Printer to you on time!
 

The AXIS 3D Printer is designed and developed by Makertech 3D, a UK based 3D Printer manufacturer. We currently have two successful Kickstarter funded 3D Printers and are hoping to add a third with the extremely affordable and accessible AXIS 3D Printer.

<p></p></div>","Pikanote is a
note taking platform for students.
We realized that students
still use Microsoft
Word to take notes in
class. They go on Facebook or Google+ to share them. And they also use
their school
platform to get the
news (lessons, homework, absent teachers…).
Why so many
complications while everything can be gathered on only one platform?
We have been working on Pikanote for several months to offer you the chance to facilitate your organization and simplify your life at school.Wow! And how does it work?You can write some text or some notes, can make links, graphs and formulas. If you want to, you can even become an artist thanks to easy drawing tools.Because organization is the key, Pikanote provides a friendly manner to classify your notes. For this, it’s as easy as 1 subject = 1 note!And for each subject, which better way to organize than the real life? In a timeline!Record your teacher during the class. You're not sure about a part? Don't worry, you just have to click on the text and you'll hear what the professor was saying at this exact moment!New school, new lessons, it’s time to build a new network of students, teachers and coach who’ll help you!With that network, access easily the lessons you missed, or improve the one you have with other’s help.Share your notes, get some tips, tricks, advice and likes.Even if you drop your laptop into the Niagara Falls, it’s not a big deal: all your documents and notes are saved in real time in the cloud.You can now put aside stress and focus on what matters: success at exams!Currently, our Geek’s Tiger Team is working on a fabulous V1 of the online platform. We already finished an Alpha Version, actually being tested by 50 people.Once this Alpha period is finished, the next steps will be:

The funds you invest in Pikanote are going to launch the first version.This first version will be completely worldwide (translated in many languages) and perfectly functional. But more precisely, why do we need funds while we already have a Beta version almost ready?In fact in an app of this size, the development is just a part, but there is a lot of other costs to consider. Among these, here are the big three:As we expect to have more than 100k users after 3 months, we need big resources. This hosting will serve on one hand to host your data and on the other hand to provide all the resources needed to store them and make the tools work efficiently.Since we are going to host a lot of information, we need to protect it well.  This is why we are going to conduct a lot of tests, and to hire a specialist full-time to make sure that your data is safe.As many of you know, there is not always internet everywhere.So, we need to develop an offline version that lets you use Pikanote even if you are in the middle of the Pacific!Because your help matters a lot to us, we’d like to thank you with gifts up to your participation and linked with Pikanote.After a long brainstorming, we finally decided that the best way to do that is to offer you some space on the cloud. Space that you can use for other media (your cat videos, your holidays pictures, your favorites songs etc.). The storage for your notes and documents is free and unlimited.And as you are special to us, we make a special offer: the space you get now, you’ll enjoy it for life!In concrete terms, the different packages are:Here is our Pika T-shirt!Time to play! Help us to launch Pikanote and we’ll reward you.You just have to distribute your link (one per person) to a maximum of people (contacts, companies, friends...)Each person who contribute on our project after have clicked on your link will be recorded on your profile.And this way you can win the following gifts:How does the referral contest workOr more info on the Facebook eventIf you contribute up to 1000€ in our project, the name of your company will appear in the top of our IndieGogo page and on the credit page of our website.It will offer you the chance to be seen by thousands of people and to take part of a fast growing company with international ambitions.For the biggest investments, we could consider various partnerships.

BELIEVER for people who want to be fully involved, become a part of the project and help us with their ideas and inputs
➤ Training & certifications granted for Zentyal Server valid for Zentyal macServer too.➤ All licenses received as perks will be fully valid commercial licenses and they will be exchangeable for the equivalent Zentyal macServer licenses upon release.➤ All perks will be delivered at the end of the crowdfunding campaign, whether the goal has been reached or not. RoadmapIf the campaign is successful we will execute the following roadmap:
End of June 2019: closing of the crowdfunding
July 2019: kick-off webinar for BELIEVERs
September 2019: first alpha released for BELIEVERs
November 2019: beta released for BELIEVERs and CERTIFIEDs
Christmas 2019: macServer released 
Risks and challengesWe have performed a thoughtful analysis of the risks ahead before launching this campaign and we have not found technical blockers. Main components (samba, apache, dovecot, postfix, etc.) are already released for macOS. Biggest work package is re-coding Zentyal core and adapting it to the macOS architecture. Want to learn more about Zentyal Server?➤ Access official documentation.➤ View tutorials on Zentyal's Youtube channel.   Who will be our main point of contact?""Since Apple dismantled their macOS Server, the world-wide Apple platform with more than 100 million Macs is server-orphaned. Currently there are 60,000 Mac channel partners, but not a single all-in-one server solution. This is a pain that Zentyal can solve"".  Sam W. Klambour, Zentyal Evangelist for macSERVERSam W. Klambour, a longstanding MacIT Manager/Mac Admin & former account manager with Apple, is the person behind the Zentyal macServer idea. He has over two decades of experience on Mac systems and he had been searching for a maOS Server substitute long and hard when he finally came across Zentyal.""Zentyal is really a perfect fit for Mac Administrators from many points of view: it is an all-in-one solution with an intuitive easy-to-use graphical user interface, made with the idea that the system administrator can manage almost everything just by using the GUI. It simply needs to be native on macOS.""",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong><u>What type of cards will be available?</u></strong></p>
<p>You will be able to import any card you are already learning and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sync with Anki and other flashcard suppliers</li>
<li>Explore and choose from our library of 500,000+ flashcards</li>
<li>Create and upload your own flashcards</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>How do I add cards to the fl!P?</strong></u></p>
<p>You'll have a companion app on your phone and the web and you will be able to pick and upload the sets you want to study on the <strong>fl!P</strong> via Bluetooth and Wifi.</p>
<p>The app will also help you track and schedule your progress, create additional study sets, etc.</p>

It brings together the power of flashcards and proven learning strategies without the bulkiness and hassle of keeping huge folders organized. 
   The fl!P leverages two of the most powerful learning techniques: retrieval practice, and spacing Retrieval Practice, also called ‘Testing Effect’ is any activity that incites you to generate an answer to a question. It can take many forms: quizzes, multiple choice tests or simply flashcards. It has consistently been proven to help learners improve retention and recall (and subsequently exam performance).The spacing effect is the phenomenon whereby learning is more efficient when studying is spread out over time, as opposed to studying the same amount of content in a single session.Spaced repetition, the technique implemented in the fl!P's learning algorithms, is a methodology that combines these two effects with truly impressive results.      A fully charged fl!P will last up to 10 days of use time (and weeks in standby-mode... but that's not the point, is it?). Phone and tablet apps drain your device's battery. The fl!P's e-paper technology requires very little energy, so you can learn anywhere, anytime.In late 2016, Emmanuel and his wife had an idea for a fun learning device for children. Emmanuel started putting together some electronic components and e-paper screens, and he and his wife quickly imagined digitising flashcards and transferring them to the device.The rest of the story involves a lot of soldering, 3D-printing, and let's face it, quite a deal of good old scotch tape.Check out all generations of prototypes below...  



What type of cards will be available?
You will be able to import any card you are already learning and more:

Sync with Anki and other flashcard suppliers
Explore and choose from our library of 500,000+ flashcards
Create and upload your own flashcards

How do I add cards to the fl!P?
You'll have a companion app on your phone and the web and you will be able to pick and upload the sets you want to study on the fl!P via Bluetooth and Wifi.
The app will also help you track and schedule your progress, create additional study sets, etc.
What is the benefit of using the fl!P instead of a regular flashcard app?
Apps may generally be more versatile, but they drain your battery, tire your eyes and push you distractions (notifications and ads) that just kill your learning effort.
That is why we decided to build a device that's, pocket-size, uses e-reader paper and has a 10-day battery life. We believe the fl!P is the perfect learning companion.

<p><strong>1. What kind of packaging will I receive?</strong></p>
<p>- It is important to ensure the product is not <span>starched or damaged</span>. For ordering less than 50 pieces, we will use a bubble envelop for shipping. For the orders more than 50 pieces, Every piece will be packed inside a ready-to-hang transparent bag (OPP bag) to make you ready to sell in your retail store or on-line store, then we will use a rigid <span>cardboard</span> box to pack them together.</p>
<p><strong>2. What if the number of pieces I want to order is not listed in the perk options?</strong></p>
<p>- It is easy, you just need to culculate the total price according to the preice per piece indicated in each perk, then add the shipping fee. done! For example, if I want to order 7 pieces, it belongs to 5-10 pcs catagrey, so the price per piece is 4$, the whole price will be 28$, adding 4$ shipping fee if you live in U.S. the total price for 7 pieces will be 32$. Then please indicate you want to order 7 piece.</p>
<p><strong>3. Is the package I ordered trackable during delivery?</strong></p>
<p>- For orders under 50 pieces, it is not traceable, because we use priority letters mail service, which is much cheaper than parcels. If you want to make your package traceable via internet, please add another 10$ so I could arrange a traceable service for you. For orders above 50 pieces, it is parcel service so it is able to be traced.</p>

Retail price US market: $89, EU market:€89
---9 Layouts (US/UK/IT/DE/FR/SP/JP/KR/ND) BladeMaster provide 9 Layouts for backers. And these layouts are shown as below:For BladeMaster PRO: For BladeMaster TE:BladeMaster was designed to be the ultimate gaming keyboard that’s widely acknowledged by the community, so during the past 14-month R&D process, thousands of gamers and keyboard enthusiasts have been involved by our forum-based team for suggestions and inspirations.Finally we’ve met all expectations by incorporating the latest and greatest tech innovations within the BladeMaster PRO. Thus we are confident that BladeMaster could be the best gaming keyboard you’ve ever seen.  ---Top Tier ComponentsAll BladeMaster keyboards are manufactured in world-class factories that produce high-end models for big brands like SteelSeries and CoolerMaster. You will find that everything used for the BladeMaster is chosen from the best!A Programmable Touch-Typing Knob for Gaming, Programming, Office Work and Anything You Want from a Keyboard !! Genius-Knob is an innovative idea that solves real problem! People are used to controlling the keyboard with left hands and control the mouse with right hands, but the keyboard is not easy to fully control by a single hand.Some of the right-hand keys and complicated functions such as macro and batch script processing can be assigned to the knob now to avoid losing control of the mouse by using right hands.   How? When you are rotating the knob forward/backward or making single-click/double-click, you are actually acting four different input commands. In this way, one knob is equal to four custom functions. When putting it into practice, you will be amazed how great it is!---Everything is under control with the Genius-KnobThere are two ways you can use knob in any games:
1. The 4 default commands of knob are PageUp, PageDown, Home & End. By entering ""Key Settings"", you can assign any operations to the knob. Taking the example of PUBG, you can get superior functions by assigning this way: Energy Drink - PageUp, Bandage - PageDown, First Aid Kit - Home, Painkiller - End.
2. By using our software(DREVO POWER CONSOLE), you can relate this knob to any keys or operations commonly used in a game by default. E.g. Forward - M, Backward - K, Single-click - 6, Double-click - =.
With this knob, in most cases you will have no need to look down on your keyboard anymore to activate game skills, so that you can always hold a step forward than others at tense gaming session.---Your nice assistant for office software & programming workBy means of Macro and Batch script, you can assign four of your most repeated and complicated operations to the knob, then your one simple touch will solve the problem.---Easier multi-media controlAdjusting your audio, lighting modes, and activating other frequent functions are a breeze.The advanced Radi Lighting System is another main feature that we are proud of. The 360° lateral middle embedded light bands are elegantly synchronized with the backlit keys. Additionally, they are combined with true 16.8 million colors, 9 lighting modes, per-key customizable as well as two-lighting overlay compatibility, making it the best RGB lighting experience you can ask for in a gaming keyboard. One of the core design principles behind the BladeMaster is “more possibilities and more convenience”. It is not logical to think that everyone will be gaming on the BladeMaster all the time. So when it comes to office work and even some professional programming work, BladeMaster is still a powerful choice!  Fully compatible with Mac & Windows

All the special functions (e.g. multimedia control, brightness control, mission control, lanchpad...) are supported on Mac & Windows. 
Except the special functions, BladeMaster support all major Oses (Windows, OS, iOs, Android, Linux, Unix).
 ---A dream keyboard for ProgrammingFlashLink Tech - Self-developed Superb 2.4GHz Wireless TechTo ensure true wireless gaming, the DREVO team has implemented a self-developed connecting tech called ""FlashLink"" in BladeMaster PRO. 
It allows you to game effortlessly under the 2.4GHz wireless mode with a superior response time - 1ms/1000Hz report rate. Besides that, other report rates are also available depending on your personal preference: 2ms/500Hz, 4ms/250Hz, 8ms/125Hz. 

Frequency hopping tech skips extra useless signal frequencies and exterior influences.

1 on 1 connection and transmission encryption will keep your data safe. 

Optimized techs are integrated to maintain a stable connection and reduce latency while keeping the power consumption lower.
DPC - Optimized Cloud SoftwareBladeMaster is designed with a full-fledged and patented software called DREVO Power Console(DPC), which can take care of all your custom needs easily!

If you are curious about the inspiration for the exterior design of the BladeMaster, it is a culmination of our designers consolidated work which includes elements from various fields like electronics, arms, biology, fashion and automobile. To sum it up, the BladeMaster’s appearance is a harmony of several things that you see around you but it’s nothing like you’ve ever seen before.The design concepts that we concluded from the elements are: humility, dynamic, sharp, lightsaber, and shield. You will notice the intricate details in the appearance is a concrete explanation of the abstract design concept.Practical Designs for More Possibilities Various Switch OptionsCherry MX RGB for BladeMaster PRO Ultimate mechanical key switches Cherry MX RGB switches are used for BladeMaster PRO.

We are glad to prove BladeMaster is at the top level from any parameter.What’s in the Package?  We give you everything commonly used for a gaming keyboard. The beautifully designed package features resistance to shock & environmental protection.Technical SpecsBladeMaster is Ready for Production  It had been a clear goal set by our DREVO team at the very beginning of the whole campaign: each supporter will be ensured of timely delivery of BladeMaster. For this goal, we’ve negotiated with numerous factories and suppliers globally already to ensure every process will be carried out as planned. Also, we've arranged some EVT samples for professional reviewers to gather feedback from them, so that we will more sure each final version BladeMaster will be of top quality!Rewards About Royal Edition Full-metal BladeMaster keyboard was actually our initial idea, which unfortunately could not come true as mass production for TE and PRO versions because of the high cost, limited production capacity, and the problems regarding blocking wireless signals. All Drevo team members, however, never give up our goals, and we are committed to implementing the full-metal version. We redesigned the side frame and the structure of lower cover, and also developed a completely new mould. The entire casing is machined by CNC, which made BladeMaster a unique masterpiece. In the current market, there is other full-metal keyboard like BladeMaster featuring so many curved surfaces and chamfers. Most other full-metal keyboards in current market were designed in a rectilinear way without curved surfaces and chamfers, which can significantly lower the cost. The $999 full-metal PERK includes not only the keyboard, but also a set of PBT Dye Sublimated rainbow keycaps, a replaceable all-metal knob, and an exclusive service - engraving on the side of the casing. More importantly, your names will appear randomly on the loading page of Drevo’s driver software to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation. $999 is definitely not only a price but also a sense of achievability and longstanding value.

<h3>How Does C’est Vrai Work?</h3>
<p>C’est Vrai is French for, ""It's true,"" a reference to the reliably-sourced, fact-based reporting function of the web app. At the time of launch, C'est Vrai will have up to <strong>5 million database entries</strong> comprised of information taken from publicly-available sources, which have been processed for names, roles, and relationship information. </p>
<p>Users will be able to search the database for information related to specific individuals or entities, as well as discover relationships between two such entities - regardless of the number of degrees of separation between them.  This function will enable reporters who use the app to save time on the research aspect of investigative reporting.  Here’s how it works:</p>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/n2RdrLLcBUY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><br/>Upon its completion, C’est Vrai will be available by subscription and serve as the backbone for a new investigative journalism worker cooperative called <strong>Progress New York</strong>.  Given the contraction of the newspaper industry and closure of Gothamist and DNA Info New York, the founding of this investigative journalism cooperative will ensure that the robust role of the “Fourth Estate” continues in New York.<br/> </div>
<h3>Timeline: What’s Next?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1 - Campaign launched: Funds raised will help developers work toward the completion of C’est Vrai.</li>
<li>Phase 2 - Campaign complete: C’est Vrai Beta goes live in March.  Subscriptions to the app and newsletter become available to contributors (depending on the amount given).</li>
<li>Phase 3 - C’est Vrai complete.  At this time, the research tool of C’est Vrai will be publicly-available via subscription.  Revenue will help build out the investigative journalism cooperative of Progress New York.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the completion of these phases, journalists, researchers, and others will be able to access C’est Vrai’s custom-built and maintained database of reliably sourced information.  Journalism is moving toward the usage of computer-assisted reporting tools, and C’est Vrai was created to rival other information products, but at a much more affordable rate.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will be putting out an exclusive weekly newsletter to contributors that will provide a curated selection of news articles based on the insight of Progress New York reporters.</p>
<h3>The Team: Progress New York</h3>
<p>Louis Flores, editor of Progress New York, is an activist and blogger who turned to citizen journalism after realizing the corporate-owned media would not fully report the truth about the corruptive role of money in politics. He began reporting on New York City politics after term limits were overturned for municipal politicians. His activism and blogs have been covered by <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Advocate</i>, <i>The New York Daily News</i>, and <i>Têtu</i>.</p>
<p>Louis Flores’ track record with citizen journalism has been impressive.  He has used an existing news website, Progress Queens, as a vehicle to file open records requests with municipal, state, and federal agencies.  Progress Queens has recorded over 100,000 page views, impactful for being an outlet for citizen journalism.  </p>
<p>Reports published by Progress Queens with the assistance of C’est Vrai have have attracted significant attention from “important eyeballs,” such as officials with the <strong>New York City Department of Investigation</strong>, the <strong>New York City Campaign Finance Board</strong>, the <strong>New York State Attorney General’s Office</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong>, and other law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Also part of this project is <strong>Michael Synan</strong>, website developer, data analyst, and technologist. He has a Master’s Degree in Urban Studies from Hunter College and has been involved in political work related to gentrification, particularly the influence of corporate real estate on land use.</p>
<p>The cooperative includes one additional member, and is actively recruiting other potential partners.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If this crowdfunding campaign is not successful, the completion of C'est Vrai may not be achieved in time for the launch of our cooperative.  Consequently, the developers will have to seek private investors or backers to fund the completion of C'est Vrai. Seeking private backers may involve loans or compromising the financial feasibility of an investigative journalism cooperative.  </p>
<p>The developers behind C'est Vrai are counting on support from the news media, big data, and worker cooperative communities to spread the word about this crowdfunding campaign so that the funding goal can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a donation, there are ways you can help this crowdfunding campaign reach its goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask your friends and families to share the link to this crowdfunding campaign and to explain what is at stake for them if we can complete the development of C'est Vrai.</li>
<li>Share this link on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Please know you can use the Indiegogo share tools as well!</li>

And for those who think paper is weak and fragile, we found the perfect solution to prove this wrong – folding.  The fascinating geometric folding structure makes a sheet of paper incredibly sturdy. g.flow stone is unbelievably light but it can hold an object that is around 100 times heavier than itself!      As beautiful as before, stronger than ever. We've upgraded our signature laptop stand into g.flow stone. Now it is waterproof and more resistant to wear and tear while maintaining what's most important to us: sustainability & social impact.     g.flow stone is the world’s lightest and most portable laptop stand, weighing only 90 grams (3 oz). A unique design idea from grape lab sustainable design lab, it is entirely made by folding a single sheet of 100% recycled paper.      g.flow stone is made of Stone Paper, a magical mixture of stone waste deriving from the mining industry. It's just like regular paper, 100% recycled, easily recyclable, and environmentally friendly. But many times more resistant to wear and tear and stronger than ever.     g.flow stone is completely waterproof. Could you ever imagine a piece of paper being waterproof without any type of coating? This is how amazing our Stone Paper is. Plus, it brings some peace to your work life. Dropped your coffee cup or water tumbler? No worries, just wipe it and you're good to go. An accident-free environment. Decided you should go work on the beach? Keep your computer safe from sand and water splash!     Source: L. Indriati, M. A. Nugraha, and Y. S. Perng, (2020).""Stone paper, an eco-friendly and free-tree paper"" American Institute of Physics conference. This is why g.flow stone is different. We strive to research every material we decide to use in our products. Our Stone Paper is made of a mixture of 80% limestone powder, a waste material that comes from the mining process of industrial limestone.  We make g.flow stone from a just single sheet of Stone Paper. No glues. No chemical coatings. No waste. The biggest difference lies here. We don't take from nature to create g.flow, we use the scraps from industry and reinvent them. Using minimum resources, we've designed a ready-to-use and ready-to-recycle laptop stand. It is a closed-loop manufacturing process.  The other 20% of Stone Paper is made of recycled plastic material. The HDPE plastic used to manufacture g.flow comes entirely from recycled sources. We stop these materials from becoming waste in the first place by collecting and transforming them. It’s our goal to prevent plastic waste from keep causing a harmful impact, polluting our oceans and nature.    Sources: Environmental Paper Network (c.environmentalpaper.org), Interference UK (inference.org.uk)       g.flow Stone is carefully made by folding one single sheet of paper, without any glues or chemical coatings. It is an analog process that meets the high-quality digital precision while focusing on using minimal resources and green technology.      It doesn't matter where your office is, g.flow is lightweight and ready to use. Slide it out of its case and say good-bye to slouching, neck and wrist pain, device overheating. Welcome proper airflow, perfect angles for typing and viewing, and a paper-light stand with waterproof quality! Digital nomad workstation ready!                 step 1: Take if out of the case. Hold it by the sides. step 2: Stretch it out to around 30 cm (12 inches) to securely place your device on it. step 3: Place your device. Make sure it is attached to the front holder. step 4: That's it! :) Enjoy using your devices comfortably.   g.flow stone Basic: Gray g.flow stone Basic: Lavender g.flow stone Art Edition: Rainbow Heart      I really like to bring pixels into the material world. They were not meant for that purpose. They are artifacts of former technical limitations, today representatives of a so-called ""Golden age of Videogaming.""I like to play with traditional art techniques and how to twist them to let them become pixelated. And thus, creating something new, because the real world and its materials are not as perfect as the math behind pixels. It's my way of questioning these digitally dominant times.     Artists Hyun-woo Kim and Kyung-wook Bae during grape lab's workshop The Art Edition Project is a collaboration with various artists from around the world. It is one of grape lab's experiments for creating a sustainable symbiotic economic system while breaking the boundaries between disabled and non-disabled artwork.  Our goal is to continue working with minorities and a diverse community, giving them opportunities for interaction and expression. We keep working with these artists to give them visibility and to help them achieve financial stability through a profit-sharing platform.         Click the image to download our press kit   While g.flow stone is our latest creation, during the past four years we have been developing many different paper-based unique products.  We consider ourselves as Folding Masters, each member of our team can fold g.flow in the blink of an eye!   You might also remember us already. That's right, we were on Kickstarter some days ago with the first launch of g.flow stone Laptop Stand. Such a successful campaign! Thank you, dear backers, you're awesome!  Couldn't back it at that time? This is the time! Go grab your g.flow stone!                      Alice Kim, grape lab's founder & art director Hi there! Alice here.Before creating grape lab, I worked as a designer in the broadcasting and IT industry for over ten years, and I had been passively contemplating the social value of design. Then I started to wonder “Is there a way to make design help someone other than just being a pretty, well-selling material?” This had been bugging me in my mind for a while but there were actually few chances for me to directly do any experiments while keeping with my busy office worker life. That's when I decided to quit, to follow what I believed, and to help to build the world I wanted to see.   While doing my Master’s Degree in Sustainable Design in the UK, I wrote a thesis called “The Bunch of Grapes”. You see, the grapes do not grow alone, but they always grow with another cluster next to them. Our society is getting more and more competitive, and as a result, we’re creating wider gaps and worse problems of inequality.   We need a growing-together structure in which small organizations or individuals connect without harming each other, just like a bunch of grapes. This ideal formation inspired me, so I wish for a circular economy system based on local small businesses in marginal areas following this theory. That's how grape lab came to life.     We are a sustainable design lab doing a variety of experiments to solve environmental and social issues from a design point of view.  Using analog and green technologies, we are going against the flow of the high-tech era, taking a different approach to solving the world’s urgent issues. We focus mainly on wasted resources and vulnerable people in marginal areas of our society.   Lifecycle matters. More important than just focusing on creating a unique product, we understand all the processes behind it. We carefully think about every step of our product’s lifecycle and its connection to the environment–from production to its disposal. Continually searching for the cleanest sources, using minimum resources, green technology, and eliminating all unnecessary elements is our design goal.   Receive and give back. Society is an important part of our environment. As a social venture, our mission is to build a more collaborative world. People with intellectual disabilities are a vital part of our society’s diversity and our team–their talents give life to our products. We help struggling minorities to achieve financial stability through employment and artists with disabilities to gain more visibility through a profit-sharing system.      Risks and challengesWe have become masters of origami folding and preparing g.flow is a common task to us. Our manufacturing line is ready and set to receive our Kickstarter production. We have printed many similar products before and we are prepared to work around most situations.If things go really wrong, our biggest risk is to have to re-print, which might cause some delay to the production and shipping. Due to the current world situation regarding COVID-19, there might be changes to the shipping costs to certain places and delays in the delivery that go beyond us.",91.0,0,"1 Campaign

Be part of the new food revolution..... Hi, I'm Matt creator of Veggiesmile and one of those guys who likes to grow his own food in the garden. 
Putting a seed in the ground and then watching it grow is an awesome thing. But being an amateur at it I didn't realize how such a small space can produce a huge amount of food! That's good and you end up sharing your food with neighbors. The more I grew the further I spread the food and then I found people 1 block, 2 blocks and 3 blocks away that were prepared to trade lemons for Kale and Apples for Cucumbers. You get the idea....

I realized that if only everyone grew a little food, even in pots or had some land to share we could reduce the HUGE food waste that is happening in the world and little by little we could start to create a sustainable growing community.
AND MAYBE WE CAN REDUCE THE 1.5 BILLION TONS OF WASTED FOOD EACH YEAR GLOBALLY....

1/3 of food produced in the world goes to waste and millions of people are starving in this world. We all have land and yards we could use to grow more food  and share in the fruits of of labor.

Help grow this seed into something sustainable... I need some money to help get this thing into production...

All Kickstarter reweards come with these four FREE bundle items!
Phigolf WGT Edition Mobile Golf Simulator Game combines the World Golf Tour (WGT) mobile game app with the power of Phigolf's state of the art golf club sensor to become the most exciting, true-to-sport, portable, and affordable golf simulator in the world. Hackers to scratch golfers are gonna LOVE this!

Phigolf is a mobile golf simulator system that includes a club sensor that analyzes your swing and relays the swing data to the Phigolf simulator app, allowing you to practice or play a round with friends and family. Two people can play one onother even remotely. You only need a smartphone, tablet, or an AppleTV to play Phigolf, and the screen can be mirrored onto a big screen TV for a more immersive game experience. Phigolf successfully raised funds on Kickstarter just last year.
Phigolf is a mobile golf simulator that can be enjoyed by all ages and skill levels.

You know World Golf Tour, or WGT. It's the #1 online video golf game on the planet! Stunningly realistic, providing access to the world’s most famous courses, WGT is free to play and more than 15 million virtual golfers across the globe are enjoying it.
WGT is a true-to-sport golf simulator game at your fingertip!
As an online mobile game, WGT is clearly a ton of fun, even if you're just controlling your swings with your fingers or mouse. But what if you could physically swing a club that realistically replicates your shots on a big screen? This would take WGT to the next level of reality and enjoyment, and that's where Phigolf comes in!

Topgolf Media, the makers of WGT, and PhiNetworks are partnering up to combine software and hardware technologies to offer you a complete golf simulator package with authentic look and feel of the sport.

Now with the integration of Phigolf's sensor into WGT's system, swinging your golf club will transport you to world famous courses in WGT. Use the sensor on the included swing trainer whose shortened length is ideal for the living room or office. Or easily mount the sensor on your own club and practice while you play. You can even use Phigolf's WGT Edition Mobile Golf Simulator on the driving range or while hitting balls into a net. The Phigolf Sensor and WGT on your smartphone makes it that portable. And you'll be able to play with or against friends & family in remote locations. Play in tournaments specifically for Phigolf WGT Edition players all while earning coins and experience points through WGT.
A great game for golfers AND non-golfers to enjoy together!
Similar golf simulator systems can cost thousands of dollars. Phigolf WGT Edition Mobile Golf Simulator wants to change that! All passionate golfers should have access to realistic golf regardless of weather or location. Never worry about that upcoming snow storm or that unbearable heat wave again.

<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">You have faithfully stuck to your new diet plan all week and have lost 5 pounds, and now you are at a dinner party and your accountability partner/friend says ""just a little wont hurt you, you deserve it""!

<br/> </h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">No, not a real one, but a virtual one! We are into kindness here, not cruelty! Something that wakes them (or you) up. Helping one to avoid that ""that was really dumb"" feeling, while instilling that ""Its really ok to laugh at my human side"" awareness! </h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">
<br/> </h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">Think of that someone you would love to say ""I TOLD YOU SO"" to, or a more parentally correct ""You've been actively doing what everyone told you not to do...and it played out exactly like everyone told you it would"" or the ""smack"" you are sending from the back of your mind as you say in your sweetest southern voice ""Bless your heart"".</h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">
<br/> </h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">We all do dumb, self-damaging things from time to time, so no one is immune from the need for this kind of 'get a grip' moment of kindness from your friends and family members who care... and who suffer almost as much brain damage watching them do dumb things as they do from actually doing them. After all we are just spiritual beings, having human experiences right?!</h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">
<br/> </h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">The Smack App solves none of these ""human experiences"". It will not make you smarter, although it may help one to learn from their mistakes a little better. It won't undo the brain damage the casual observers in your life go through every time one falls into one of these behavior patterns, but it just might make it more entertaining! Soften the blow, so to speak.</h3>

Allowing us to deliver the much needed message in a way that would otherwise be avoided as not to offend or upset anyone.</h3>

<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">The Smack App will allow you to send short videos of Dr. Reed's fun-based intervention messages to help get your friends and family back on the right track when they've just done something utterly ... Well, lets just say not so smart.</h3>

<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">Some of the video messages being developed are: The Dating Smack, The Diet Smack, The What Were You Thinking Smack, etc. featuring Dr. Reed delivering her best corrective interventions! Spiritual Gansta Style!</h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">
<br/> </h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none;"">Our goal with the Smack App is to provide everyone with a fun and funny tool for improving their lives by giving us all that much-needed ""enlightening nudge"" for our most self-damaging behaviors, while creating an environment of friends and family who care enough to be that supportive partner in our lives who knows when we need a supportive kick in the rump.</h3>

</div></div>","The Smack App.

 
Imagine, pretend if you need to ...You're sitting on the other end of a call as your friend explains that they just went back into a lousy relationship that they swore they'd never go back to. 

 
You just got a bonus, you can finally pay off your debts and your sweetie says ""lets go on a vacation or go out and celebrate""! (The reply will determine who needs the smack here.)

 
You have faithfully stuck to your new diet plan all week and have lost 5 pounds, and now you are at a dinner party and your accountability partner/friend says ""just a little wont hurt you, you deserve it""! (Again ...The reply will determine who needs the smack here.)

 
By now you're all thinking of someone you'd just love to SMACK!

 
No, not a real one, but a virtual one! We are into kindness here, not cruelty! Something that wakes them (or you) up. Helping one to avoid that ""that was really dumb"" feeling, while instilling that ""Its really ok to laugh at my human side"" awareness! 

 
Think of that someone you would love to say ""I TOLD YOU SO"" to, or a more parentally correct ""You've been actively doing what everyone told you not to do...and it played out exactly like everyone told you it would"" or the ""smack"" you are sending from the back of your mind as you say in your sweetest southern voice ""Bless your heart"".

 
We all do dumb, self-damaging things from time to time, so no one is immune from the need for this kind of 'get a grip' moment of kindness from your friends and family members who care... and who suffer almost as much brain damage watching them do dumb things as they do from actually doing them. After all we are just spiritual beings, having human experiences right?!

 
The Smack App solves none of these ""human experiences"". It will not make you smarter, although it may help one to learn from their mistakes a little better. It won't undo the brain damage the casual observers in your life go through every time one falls into one of these behavior patterns, but it just might make it more entertaining! Soften the blow, so to speak.

The Smack App is a video messaging app that is being developed by Dr. Martha Reed to help people realize, in a humorous, lighthearted way, when they are falling into a bad pattern in their lives and give them that remedial wake-up that can help them make a better decision in their lives. Allowing us to deliver the much needed message in a way that would otherwise be avoided as not to offend or upset anyone.

 
The Smack App will allow you to send short videos of Dr. Reed's fun-based intervention messages to help get your friends and family back on the right track when they've just done something utterly ... Well, lets just say not so smart.

 
Some of the video messages being developed are: The Dating Smack, The Diet Smack, The What Were You Thinking Smack, etc. featuring Dr. Reed delivering her best corrective interventions! Spiritual Gansta Style!

 
Our goal with the Smack App is to provide everyone with a fun and funny tool for improving their lives by giving us all that much-needed ""enlightening nudge"" for our most self-damaging behaviors, while creating an environment of friends and family who care enough to be that supportive partner in our lives who knows when we need a supportive kick in the rump.

 
For this app to become a reality though, we need your help. We need to cover costs for some serious video production and editing as well as for initial production costs for the app. We're asking for $15,000 of your help to make this entertaining and helpful addition to our lives a reality.

 
Each donation, no matter how small, is an important one, and we appreciate them all tremendously. That's why we have put together this assortment of rewards for every donation level. Donate at whatever level you'd like; then come back again and donate again! And again! Bring your friends, make a day of it!

<p> </p></figure></div><p>The PrintBrush XDR is a wireless full color inkjet printer that weighs about the same as an average smartphone but can print larger imprints than its own size.</p><p>This new versatile device will change the way we think about printing because, for the first time, it is now possible to print anything in full color anywhere, on almost any surface.</p><p>The imprints are made simply by using a sweeping action, just swapping the printer’s direction from left to right or right to left, directly on any surface, be it paper, cardboard, fabrics, wood, etc.</p><p>Ordinary printer technology is significantly limited for mobile usage by the fact that printout size is directly linked to device width. RMPT overcomes this limitation by allowing larger printout sizes with smaller hardware. </p><p>Another advantage is the ability to print directly onto a wide variety of surfaces of varying thicknesses. Mobile users can therefore pick up any paper or material available and use it as print media. This advantage opens up applications far beyond mobile printing.</p><p>We have been working with RMPT since the year 2000 and are the pioneers of this game-changing technology.   Right from the early years of development, we could prove that letter-size printing is possible with RMPT: </p><div data-href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSM5z5vL-Qo""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSM5z5vL-Qo?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div><p>It is important to highlight that the PrintBrush XDR CANNOT currently print at full letter-size but it is a step closer to that goal. Our hope is that the Indiegogo community can make the difference.</p><p>The PrintBrush XDR can print up to three swaths with a small gap in between each sweep. It is an excellent choice for printing pieces of text and graphics in full color but not yet fully recommended for photos.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""23559775""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549537408/qtei2iedbkaxximwxv2i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>PrintBrush XDR is one of the first devices featuring RMPT technology. RMPT is the only viable technology path to build truly portable printing devices.</p><p>Using advanced software instead of hardware, RMPT opens the way for miniaturization, mechanical simplicity and a lack of electrical motors, thus making it an excellent choice for the environment.</p><p>Thanks to the miniature size of the printer, we have created very compact and light packaging. Compared to the packaging of one ordinary desktop printer, we would be able to squeeze in more than 55 packaged units of our printer.</p><p>When you consider that over 100 million desktop printers are manufactured every year, our technology has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and plastic, to say nothing of saving huge amounts of energy during manufacturing and usage. Users also have the potential of saving a few trees since they can go paperless and start printing on re-usable substrates such as whiteboards! </p><p> </p><div data-id=""23592484""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549537435/agvjko8towntdecxq9g9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div><p>As the user slides the PrintBrush XDR across a surface, an optical sensor tracks the velocity and direction of the printer relative to the surface. A controller matches the software interrupts to the relevant columns of the imprint image. </p><p>Thanks to built-in sensors and intelligent software, the imprint will always be correct independently of the direction or the speed of a user’s hand movement. You can go as slow or as fast as you want. You can even stop in the middle of the printout: the PrintBrush XDR delivers accurate and reliable results.</p><div data-caption=""Exploded view of the PrintBrush XDR"" data-id=""23592467""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Exploded view of the PrintBrush XDR"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1549303470/fex9n0x9uygoorgrdrfn.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><i>Exploded view of the PrintBrush XDR</i></figcaption></figure></div><p> </p><p>The selection of the content to be printed is done through a control App in a smartphone, tablet or a laptop.

 The PrintBrush XDR is a wireless full color inkjet printer that weighs about the same as an average smartphone but can print larger imprints than its own size.This new versatile device will change the way we think about printing because, for the first time, it is now possible to print anything in full color anywhere, on almost any surface.The imprints are made simply by using a sweeping action, just swapping the printer’s direction from left to right or right to left, directly on any surface, be it paper, cardboard, fabrics, wood, etc.Ordinary printer technology is significantly limited for mobile usage by the fact that printout size is directly linked to device width. RMPT overcomes this limitation by allowing larger printout sizes with smaller hardware. Another advantage is the ability to print directly onto a wide variety of surfaces of varying thicknesses. Mobile users can therefore pick up any paper or material available and use it as print media. This advantage opens up applications far beyond mobile printing.We have been working with RMPT since the year 2000 and are the pioneers of this game-changing technology.   Right from the early years of development, we could prove that letter-size printing is possible with RMPT: It is important to highlight that the PrintBrush XDR CANNOT currently print at full letter-size but it is a step closer to that goal. Our hope is that the Indiegogo community can make the difference.The PrintBrush XDR can print up to three swaths with a small gap in between each sweep. It is an excellent choice for printing pieces of text and graphics in full color but not yet fully recommended for photos. 
 PrintBrush XDR is one of the first devices featuring RMPT technology. RMPT is the only viable technology path to build truly portable printing devices.Using advanced software instead of hardware, RMPT opens the way for miniaturization, mechanical simplicity and a lack of electrical motors, thus making it an excellent choice for the environment.Thanks to the miniature size of the printer, we have created very compact and light packaging. Compared to the packaging of one ordinary desktop printer, we would be able to squeeze in more than 55 packaged units of our printer.When you consider that over 100 million desktop printers are manufactured every year, our technology has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of tons of steel and plastic, to say nothing of saving huge amounts of energy during manufacturing and usage. Users also have the potential of saving a few trees since they can go paperless and start printing on re-usable substrates such as whiteboards!  
 As the user slides the PrintBrush XDR across a surface, an optical sensor tracks the velocity and direction of the printer relative to the surface. A controller matches the software interrupts to the relevant columns of the imprint image. Thanks to built-in sensors and intelligent software, the imprint will always be correct independently of the direction or the speed of a user’s hand movement. You can go as slow or as fast as you want. You can even stop in the middle of the printout: the PrintBrush XDR delivers accurate and reliable results.Exploded view of the PrintBrush XDR The selection of the content to be printed is done through a control App in a smartphone, tablet or a laptop. When selection is ready, just push a print button (choosing single or multiple imprints) on the control App and then move the printer from left to right or right to left over the substrate to be printed.The device can work as a stand-alone, untethered device if images have been previously uploaded to it. The device is WiFi enabled (No WiFi router needed) and has a USB interface as backup for data connectivity.   INDUSTRIAL DESIGN Much attention has been vested into the industrial design of the PrintBrush XDR. Following the Swedish tradition of a minimalist and simplistic design, we eliminated -from the very beginning- the idea of having any superfluous elements. The idea was to create a design that fits perfectly into the palm of your hand. The industrial design defined the size of all the internal components. It was a huge challenge, but we are proud to have achieved our goal.The device is being manufactured in two colors: Black and white, but we will be offering many customization options thanks to a replaceable cover. TESTINGWe have carried out an exhaustive test schedule, printing millions of imprints with our pilot units to make sure that they provide the highest possible reliability and quality.We have even built special machines to carry out automated testing: PrintBrush XDR automated test equipment MANUFACTURINGSeveral hundred units of the PrintBrush XDR have already been manufactured in pilot production runs. It means that we have all the production tooling ready. The component supply chain has been secured. Purchase orders for mass production have been given and components are now in stock or on their way to the factory. As a backer, you can be assured that you will be getting your chosen reward on time. SHIPPINGBecause we are able to ship more than 500 units in a single pallet, we will be bulk shipping to major markets (North America and Europe) so that our backers won't have to worry about custom fees in those regions. Shipping costs are very low due to the low weight and small volume of our device. 
 We recently close a very successful Kickstarter campaign but we still keep receiving everyday inquiries from people that missed the initial campaign in that platform. While we start the deliveries to those initial backers, we are queuing new incoming pre-orders on Indiegogo.We also want to engage strongly with both communities to help us reach our ultimate goal of developing and industrializing our PrintBrush A4 product concept. This will provide the possibility of printing print letter-sized documents on the fly, challenging and beginning to replace to certain extent, ordinary desktop printers.All backers that are pledging on a PrintBrush XDR will get a 30% discount on their future pledge for a PrintBrush A4.   
 
 
 PrintDreams has developed several apps to demonstrate the PrintBrush XDR’s flexibility. The company is inviting app vendors to integrate direct printing capabilities into their apps now that the PrintBrush XDR is making on-the-go printing truly mobile. A developer package with SDK for both iOS and Android is available as a reward. A simple- and small Windows Java application is already available. A Linux application too.iOS App (For Apple's iPhones and iPads)This app is free of charge and included in the purchase of the PrintBrush XDR. The Graphical User Interface of the iOS app and corresponding libraries are ready and can be experienced here. We want the input from our backers before we release our first beta version into the App Store. Our partners COLOP have demonstrated their iOS App for the COLOP e-mark, live during the Paperworld show between January 26th -29th 2019 in Frankfurt, Germany.Android AppA beta release of a demo app is already available for free download on Google Play. Try it here:  The look and feel is quite different from the iOS version but it allows us to test another usability approach. Eventually we will merge into a version which feels best for our backers and customers.

 A project that has being on the making as long as ours has required support from many different people and partners.Initially the development has taken place in our hometown, Stockholm, Sweden. The first prototypes and the industrial design have been done there. Looking for more cost-effective product development opportunities, we co-founded a company in Bangalore, India, called Symbolein Technologies. Further hardware and part of firmware development has since been carried out by Unizen Technologies.Part of technical development team in India Since 2009, we have been working with our Austrian partners COLOP, taking the cooperation to a whole new level in the summer of 2017. Together we started the industrialization of the product platform in which the PrintBrush XDR is based, starting a joint venture early 2018.With COLOP's in-depth knowledge of mechanics and their dedication to product quality, we managed to industrialize a product that we are now proud to offer to our backers.Development & Product team in Austria COLOP is launching a similar product called COLOP e-mark which is aimed at the office- and stamp market segments. It was launched during the Paperworld 2019 Fair in Frankfurt, Germany between January 26th to 29th 2019.The PrintBrush XDR had its first initial public release during GITEX 2018 Expo in Dubai working with our distributor in the region, KTech. The interest from visitors was overwhelming. This encouraged us to launch this Kickstarter campaign and keep working even harder.GITEX 2018 launch in Dubai, UAE, drew a great deal of interest from attendees. Following GITEX, we made our official product announcement in London on December 4th 2018, along with our partners COLOP and Hewlett Packard SPS.Our most recent appearance was during CES 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, between January 8th-11th 2019. The stream of visitors and the feedback we got was above all our expectations. Here there are some highlights from the show floor:",26.0,4,"1 Campaign

Full charging time is about one hour. Charging is by USB port on Phree or by external wireless charging pad for Phree with case.</div><div> </div><p><b>Q: <b>How far of a distance from the target device will Phree still work?</b></b></p><div>A: The Bluetooth® connection works well typically a few meters from the target device.</div><div> </div><p><b>Q: <b>What operating systems, devices and apps are supported by Phree?</b> </b></p><div>A: Phree supports all major phone, tablet and PC operating systems – Android, iOS, Windows, OSX (Mac), Linux. Phree supports most third party apps on Android, OSX, Windows like Office, OneNote, EverNote, Photoshop, Acrobat, Sketchbook, Google Handwriting Keyboard, Viber, Skitch and more – using the existing interfaces and cursor on the screen. For iOS (like iPhone or iPad) and Android, our app allows users to take quick notes, use Phree as a headset, and display notifications. Currently iOS devices do not show a cursor on their screens and do not support cursor control, so Phree can support only third party iOS apps that interface to Bluetooth® mouse, pen, handwriting recognition keyboard software or specifically interface to Phree.</div><div> </div><p><b>Q: <b>Can one enter text using Phree?</b></b></p><div>A: Operating systems such as Windows, Apple OSX and Android include handwriting recognition software.

The idea behind Phree is to provide a complete, real-time digital experience to write, sketch and interact in the digital world. The best interactive digital user experience is when Phree is without Ink.

<p>Most of the purifiers in the market are either low purify speed or not potent enough to remove all air pollutants.  They may take at least half an hour or even longer purify the air completely. Normally, it only takes you half an hour drive to reach the destination. Somehow, breathing in harmful and polluted air for half an hour would have already threatened the health of people with allergies and even ordinary people. Therefore, a specialized purifier that can quickly resolve the air quality in the car is essential.

<div>My background is in Science &amp; Technology Studies and Contemporary Leadership. I studied science as a process, tracing an idea from its inception, to research and development, and its integration and effects on society. Over the course of a year, I learned the roles, modes, and means in which we manage, share, and use knowledge to make decisions. At the intersection of scientific collaborations, open data in business, and participatory education for students, I found an opportunity that's brought me here today. I believe Meritocracy can interweave these three groups, crowdsource knowledge to mobilize action, and create jobs to power its engines. </div>

<p>Hey, I am a young boy and I am 22

<p>**** Probably sounds boring but please read more. ****</p>
<p>I create a $1 million campaigne to change my entire life. I
want to make a important change in my life while I am young. I want to become a
Millionaire. </p>
<p>I will tell you where I got the idea.</p>
<p>1. I saw a few months ago a youtube clip with a guy who ask
for one million dollars (he ask from 1 person or company these), seemed strange.</p>
<p>2. I see all the time advertices with Crowdfunding Sites.
These is something strange in my country because people don’t make donations
for dreams and another things because is a poor country and they don’t care.</p>
<p>3. I'm sick to work just to survive. I can not have my
house, my car and I can not afford vacations.</p>
<p>4. Now on 26.10.2013 at 1:27 a.m I got the idea to try to
change my life becoming a millionaire.</p>
<p> So I said to try the
Indiegogo website to see if it’s so easy how it looks to raise money for a
campaigne.</p>
<p>My goal is $1 million but I don’t want to ask for it from 1
person or company (how did the guy on youtube)  because is impossible to succeed. </p>
<p>I would like to receive it from many people, even from 1
million people. In these way is not impossible ( everyone can afford it to
donate $1 ). </p>
<p>The earth has 7 billions people so 1 million is not so much.</p>
<p><b>Probably you wonder
why you should give me $1. Because you have it and I need it. Is not a big

<p>If you wonder what I will do with money ....well... </p>
<ol>
<li>First
     I want to see how is to be a millionaire, to feel that feeling and forget
     the lack of funds. </li>
<li>The
     second thing I will go in a vacation with family. </li>
<li>I will
     buy a house and a car.</li>
<li>I will

CyberGhost-#NoSpyProxy-Kampagnenseite herumscrollt, erkennt schnell: Das massive
Eindringen der Geheimdienste ins Internet stieß nicht nur auf Gleichgültigkeit,
sondern auch auf aktive Gegenwehr. Wir fanden so viele Unterstützer für ein
abgesichertes Datencenter, dass wir aus Performancegründen Obergrenzen
definieren mussten, und sind jetzt, mit den Erfahrungen eines knappen Jahres
gerüstet, bereit, die immer noch wachsende Zahl Interessenten unterzubringen,
die bislang aus Kapazitätsgründen vor der Tür stehen bleiben mussten. Das
Indiegogo-Feature ‘InDemand’ erlaubt uns die Fortführung der ursprünglichen Kampagne
und so entschlossen wir uns, weitere Mittel für die Fortführung und den geplanten
Ausbau des #NoSpyProxy-Datencenters zu sammeln. Du kannst ab sofort wieder
spenden oder einen Perk anfordern. Lasst uns gemeinsam das Internet privat und
frei halten!]</span>
<hr/>
Die Welt ist eine andere, seit wir mit Gewissheit sagen können, dass gewöhnliche Internet-Anwender nicht mehr nur Hacker und kleinkriminelle Datendiebe abwehren müssen, sondern auch permanente Angriffe geheimer Regierungsbehörden aus dem In- und Ausland, allzu oft sogar mit Hilfe der eigenen lokalen Internet Service Provider.<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>Das einzige Gegenmittel:
Verschlüsselung! Verschlüsselung ist nach dem weitläufigen Versagen moralischer
und politischer Sicherungssysteme die bislang wirksamste Lösung zur
Wiederherstellung von Internetsicherheit und Online-Privatsphäre. Die meisten
Verschlüsselungshürden sind nach wie vor auch für die immense technische
Kompetenz<span>  großer Geheimdienste nicht
passierbar und schützen alleine dadurch, dass sie deren Spionage-Anstrengungen
bis hinter die finanziellen Schmerzgrenzen erhöhen.</span>  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/724109/files/20140717050743-europe2.png?1405598863"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Auch CyberGhost sichert sein VPN-Netzwerk und seine
Anwender in erster Linie durch Verschlüsselung, in diesem Fall durch auf
längere Sicht nicht kompromittierbare 256 Bit AES – unabhängig davon, wo sich
jemand befindet: zuhause, auf der Arbeit, in der Schule, auf Reisen oder in
einem öffentlichen WLAN. Darüber hinaus erfolgt ein Austausch der originalen
IP-Adresse eines Internet-Surfers. Auf diese Weise werden Downloads
und Daten wie Passwörter,
Bankkonten, Kreditkarten, Dokumente und Identitäten in einem nicht abhörbaren
Tunnel übermittelt, während Anwender dort, wo sie die verschlüsselte Umgebung verlassen (um beispielsweise
nicht sichere http-Webseiten zu besuchen), nicht zurückverfolgt und
identifiziert werden können. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Zu diesem Zweck unterhalten wir ein weltweites Netzwerk mit mehr als 550+ Servern, bieten anwendefreundliche Client-Lösungen für
Windows, Mac OS X, iOS und Android an und unterstützen native VPN-Protokolle
für Linux und Chrome OS, sowie Router, Raspberry und andere Geräte.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jetzt
sollen die Dinge auf eine höhere Ebene gehoben und die für den Dienst
notwendige Hardware schrittweise unter eigene Kontrolle gebracht werden. Warum?
CyberGhost betreibt als globaler VPN-Betreiber viele Server in zahlreichen
Ländern Europas, den USA und Asien – und die penible<span>  Überwachung der Server ist wichtiger
Bestandteil der alltäglich wiederkehrenden Arbeiten. Hierzu gehören unter
anderem die übliche Wartung der Hard- und Software sowie – eines der elementarste
Kernbereiche überhaupt – die Gewährleistung, dass ein System nicht
kompromittiert worden ist; eingebunden in ein exakt definiertes Prozedere,
deren Einhaltung für ein VPN schlicht überlebensnotwendig ist. <br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Aber während
eingebaute Alarmfunktionen und ferngesteuerte Check-ups ausreichend sind, eine
Übernahme auf Softwarebasis auszuschließen, klafft bei Hardwarechecks vor Ort naturgemäß
eine prinzipiell sicherheitskritische zeitliche Lücke im Abschnitt zwischen
zwei Überprüfungen. Nutzt ein Geheimdienst die Chance, einen Server innerhalb
dieser Spanne zu infiltrieren, bleiben dessen Aktivitäten für eine gewisse Zeit
unentdeckt</span>. Ursache hierfür ist, dass keine direkte <i>lückenlose</i> Kontrolle über die weltweit verteilten Server durch
CyberGhost möglich ist. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">

Bislang,
denn der nächste logische Schritt in der Entwicklung unseres VPN-Dienstes ist
die Schließung dieser Lücke durch die Einrichtung eigener Datencenter zur direkten
<i>lückenlosen</i> Kontrolle über die weltweit
verteilten Server als weitere, zusätzliche Sicherheitsschicht. Hierzu
investierte das Unternehmen bereits 50.000 EURO aus eigenen Mitteln, benötigt aber
zum Abschließen des Projekts und der Errichtung des ersten Prototypen eure
Hilfe. Zusammen mit euch werden wir das weltweit erste #NoSpyProxy-Datencenter bauen!<br/><br/></p>

<br/><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: black;""><h2>Welchen Nutzen bringt ein CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy-Datencenter?</h2></a><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Das
moderne Internet ist Schauplatz eines technischen Kriegs geworden, der gegen
uns alle geführt wird, den gewöhnlichen Anwendern! Hacker, Datendiebe und
Regierungsbehörden infiltrieren dank immenser Hightech-Ausrüstung und unterstützt
durch nahezu endlose finanzielle Ressourcen den Kern dessen, was wir ‚das
Internet‘ nennen. Sie machen sich Dienste, Software und Websites ebenso zunutze
wie PCs, Router und Server, mit dem Ziel, alles zu beobachten und aufzuzeichnen,
was wir online unternehmen. Einziges Gegenmittel für diese schleichende
Zersetzung unserer Lebensführung: Verschlüsselung.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Damit der VPN-Dienst CyberGhost eine lückenlose Verschlüsselungskette garantieren
kann, müssen wir über die vollständige und dauerhafte Kontrolle jedes
einzelnen Gliedes unseres Netzwerks verfügen: Login-System, Verschlüsselungsprotokolle, Schlüsselmanagement
und schließlich die Server selbst. Wir erreichen dies im Moment durch Anmietung
oder Kauf dedizierter Server, zu denen nur wir Root-Zugang besitzen
und die wir mit Anti-Spy-Tools vollgepflastert haben. Um aber trotz
regelmäßiger Kontrollen dauerhaft sicherzugehen, dass weder die NSA noch Hacker
physischen Zugang zu einem unserer Server hatten, bauen wir jetzt ein eigenes
Datencenter zur ausschließlichen Verwendung als #NoSpyProxy-Node.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/726242/files/20140718010215-CG_Servers_B4b.png?1405670535"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Der erste
CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy ist der Prototyp einer völlig neuen Art Datencenter! Es wird
ausschließlich von unseren zertifizierten Sicherheitsspezialisten installiert
und gewartet und dient ausschließlich dem effektiven Schutz von Internetanwendern rund um den
Globus vor Massenüberwachung, Hackern sowie Daten- und Identitätsdiebstahl. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ironischerweise handelt es sich streng gesehen nicht um ein ‚Datencenter‘ im
herkömmlichen Sinn, sondern um ein ‚Keindaten-Center‘, also eine neue
Generation IT-Technologie, die eingesetzt wird, um die Privatsphären der
Menschen und deren Online-Sicherheit zu schützen. Wir nutzen diese ""Blaupause"", um eine ganze Reihe von #NoSpyProxy-Nodes in allen möglichen Ländern und Regionen schnell hochzuziehen, denn unsere #NoSpyProxy-Rechenzentren sind 
platzsparend, einfach zu bedienen, einfach zu errichten und – am wichtigsten –
NSA-sicher!<br/><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die Art und Weise, wie sich ein Unternehmen finanziert, dass
Privatsphäre als Geschäftsmodell betreibt, ist ein wichtiges Detail für das gesamte Projekt. Würden wir auf dem Geldmarkt nach Beteiligunsgkapital suchen, würden wir ein Engagement akzeptieren, das mit Bedingungen verknüpft ist und
wir würden unsere Unabhängigkeit gefährden. Es wäre ebenso grob fahrlässig, den Dienst über Werbung zu
finanzieren. Denn wer für ein Produkt nicht bezahlt wird am
Ende selbst das Produkt. Privatsphäre und werbebasierte Dienste passen einfach nicht
zusammen.</p>

Der beste Weg für Unternehmen wie uns, die aus dem Bedürfnis
nach Sicherheit und Privatsphäre ein Geschäft machen, besteht folglich darin, seine
Anwender direkt um Geld zu bitten. Dadurch geht die Kontrolle auf diejenigen über,
die uns direkt finanzieren: Unsere Anwender. Und die können sicher sein, dass wir - in ihrem Auftrag - unsere Bestes tun, um ihre Sicherheit zu gewährleisten. Oder mit anderen Worten: „<i>Nur die, die für die Musik bezahlen,
bestimmen die Melodie.</i>“<p></p>

Welche Zahlmethoden werden unterstützt?

</h4>
<p>Die angebotenen Zahlweisen hängen ausschließlich von
Indiegogo ab. Zurzeit sind dies PayPal und verschiedene Kreditkarten wie Visa,
MasterCard, Discover und American Express. Beachte bitte, dass die Verfügbarkeit
und Akzeptanz einer Kreditkarte auch vom Land abhängt, in dem du lebst, und
dass alle Zahlungen via Kreditkarte ebenfalls von PayPal abgewickelt werden –

Der übliche Zahlungsdienstleister für
CyberGhost-Produkte, cleverbridge, ist <i>nicht</i>
Teil der Kampagne.<br/><br/><h4>Wann wird mein Perk ausgeliefert?</h4>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Die Perks, die einen sofortigen Zugang zu den CyberGhost-Premium-Plus-Servern beinhalten, werden so schnell wie möglich ausgeliefert. Spätestens 48 Arbeitsstunden nach Zahlungseingang solltest du deinen Aktivierungsschlüssel erhalten. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Das Premium Plus-Paket inklusiver Server ist bei allen Perks enthalten, solltest du aber einen Perk mit 'regulärem Boarding' erworben haben, musst du auf den Zugang zum #NoSpyProxy warten, bis der Betabetrieb beendet und das Datencenter in den  Regelbetrieb übergegangen ist. Die Glücklichen mit Vorzugs-Boarding werden im Gegensatz dazu in den ersten Reihen sitzen und bereits Zugriff auf die Betaversion erhalten.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Falls ihr euer Ziel nicht erreicht, wird dann das #NoSpyProxy-Datencenter nicht gebaut?</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Selbst wenn wir unser Ziel verfehlen, wird das Datencenter aus den bis dahin eingenommenen und unseren eigenen Mitteln finanziert und errichtet – nur nicht so schnell. Die Dinge verlangsamen sich dann spürbar und andere Projekte (wie unser eigener kabelloser Router oder die Inbetriebnahme eines Accelerator-Programms für Privatsphären-orientierte Startups auf Basis unserer API) werden zurückgestellt.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Bedeutet die Errichtung des Datencenters auch mehr Server für den Free Service? 
</h4>Ja, wir werden dem bestehenden Free-Server-Pool neue Server hinzufügen.<br/><br/><b></b><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<h4>Warum Indiegogo? 
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CyberGhost VPN ist international und überall auf der Welt verfügbar, wie Indiegogo. Wir haben Anwender in Amerika, Europa, Afrika, Asien und Australien. Unser  Unternehmen wurde von Deutschen gegründet, hat aber seinen Stammsitz in Bukarest, Rumänien, und setzt sich aus Mitarbeitern verschiedener Nationalitäten zusammen. Zurzeit sprechen wir acht verschiedene Sprachen im Team und fühlen uns als Weltbürger pudelwohl. Deshalb haben wir uns für eine Plattform entschieden, die ebenfalls überall auf der Welt verfügbar ist und so nebenbei sowohl PayPal als auch reguläre Kreditkarten als Zahlungsmittel akzeptiert. So erfährt die Kampagne die beste Verbreitung.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Überschätzt ihr euch nicht ein wenig, ein ‚NSA-sicheres‘ Datencenter zu bauen? Das ist eine wirklich große Nummer! </h4>

<h4>Bekomme ich wirklich ein lebenslanges Abonnement für CyberGhost? Was bedeutet das? 
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wir versorgen dich mit einem magischen Aktivierungsschlüssel. Dieser Schlüssel ist 99 Jahre gültig und wird in dieser Zeit immer dem aktuell wertigsten Abonnement gleichgestellt. Pure Magie … <br/><br/></p>
<h4>Was bekomme ich, wenn ich das ‘Geschäftskonto’ wähle? 
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Du bekommst einen eigenen, privaten VPN-Server zusätzlich zum üblichen Zugriff auf alle anderen Server im Pool. Der Unterschied: Dieser Server ist deine persönliche Heimstatt und du kannst ihn mit bis zu 100 Angestellten teilen, das heißt, du erhältst 100 Aktivierungsschlüssel von uns.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Verfügt ihr über eine Bitcoin-Adresse (BTC), über die ich spenden kann?</h4>

<hr/>
<br/><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: black;""><h2>Was zeichnet CyberGhost aus? </h2></a><br/><div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Cyberghost ist ein VPN-Startup mit mehr als 5 Millionen Anwender weltweit. Ziel ist, Internetanwender von den negativen Begleiterscheinungen des modernen Internets zu befreien, also ihnen dabei zu helfen, auf blockierte oder zensierte Inhalte zuzugreifen, ihre Privatsphäre zu schützen und generell mehr Sicherheit herzustellen, während sie online sind. Wir möchten die Freiheiten des frühen Internet wieder herstellen und in die nächste Generation retten!<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/797565/files/20140819033037-notjustVPN-DE.png?1408444237"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
</div>
<h4>No Track Policy!</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Führen wir Weblogs, protokollieren wir das Surfverhalten der Anwender oder zeichnen wir Inhalte, besuchte Webseiten oder die IP-Adressen unserer Anwender auf? Nein! Warum nicht? Menschen in undemokratischen und unfreien Ländern (also möglicherweise auch DU!) befinden sich bereits in unmittelbarer Gefahr für Leib und Leben, wenn sie ihre Meinung öffentlich äußern. Implementierten wir Hintertüren, Deep Packet Inspektionen oder zeigten uns generell offen für das Ansinnen von Behörden und Regierungen, Informationen über unsere Anwender aufzuzeichnen, gefährdeten wir deren Leben. Wir werden dies nicht tun! Niemals!<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Jederzeit und für jedermann einfach anzuwenden</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Mit CyberGhost VPN bleibt effektiver Internetschutz nicht länger Experten und Nerds vorbehalten. Die Software ist supereinfach zu bedienen und liefert auch dem unerfahrensten Anwender per simplem Mausklick sofortige Online-Sicherheit und –Privatsphäre mit (auch vom US-Militär genutzten) 256 Bit AES. Wir halten bequem anzuwendende Applikationen für Windows, Mac, iOS und Android zum <a href=""http://www.cyberghostvpn.com/de_de/herunterladen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Download</a> bereit sowie einen kostenlosen <a href=""https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/de_de/proxy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Web-Proxy</a> für Anonymität während des Surfens und ein <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cyberghost-vpn-free-proxy/fcbnikgemihknccdjaihjnfbapinljpi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chrome-Add-on</a> zur Verschleierung der IP-Adresse direkt und einfach in deinem Browser.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Globales Netzwerk 
</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CyberGhost verfügt über mehr als 550+ Server in multiplen Standorten in 31 Ländern rund um den Globus. Alle Server sind mit 256 Bit AES verschlüsselt und bieten sowohl schnelle Verbindungen als auch breiten Zugang zu blockierten Inhalten in anderen Ländern. Anwender können nach Belieben ihren Standort wechseln, wann immer sie als Surfer einer bestimmten Region gelten wollen.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Blitzschnelle Verbindung</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unser Traum ist, einen Sicherheitspuffer für dich zu erschaffen, den du nicht bemerkst, während du surfst oder downloadest. Aus diesem Grund drehen wir stetig an den Optimierungsschrauben für Geschwindigkeit UND Sicherheit. Wir verfügen über Gigabit-Server mit innovativen Hard- und Software-Konfigurationen; der selbstgebaute #NoSpyProxy ist dabei der nächste Schritt zur perfekten Ausrüstung.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Sicherheit made in Europe</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CyberGhost hat seinen Standort in der Europäischen Union und operiert unter rumänischer Gesetzgebung, was uns das Recht gibt, KEINE Logs anzulegen und die Identitäten unserer Anwender effektiv zu schützen. Die Chancen, ein Privatsphären-Unternehmen auf dem Territorium der ‘Five Eyes’-Mitglieder Australien, Kanada, Neuseeland, dem Vereinigten Königreich und den USA zu führen, ohne gezwungen zu sein, Anwenderdaten zu erfassen und zu speichern, sind dagegen gleich Null.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>'Offene Türen' statt 'Offener Quellcode'</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Der Heartbleed-Bug in OpenSSL hat gezeigt, dass 'Open Source' nicht zwangsläufig als sicher gelten kann, nur weil theoretisch der Quellcode für alle offen einsehbar ist. Wir glauben, dass Transparenz und 'best practice' wichtiger sind. Darum sind wir bereit, Bürgerrechts- und Netzaktivisten sowie Mitglieder von NGOs in unseren Unternehmensräumen zu empfangen, um sowohl die Lokalitäten als auch den Quellcode unabhängig überprüfbar zu machen. Externe Audits, kombiniert mit 'best practices', sind der beste Weg, einen hohen Sicherheitsstandard zu etablieren.  CyberGhost ist als Unternehmen mit den Sicherheitsstandards ISO 9001 und ISO 27001 zertifiziert; unsere Sicherheitsingenieure besitzen individuelle CompTIA-Sicherheitszertifikate und befinden sich ständig in Aus- und Weiterbildung zur Anpassung an veränderte Anforderungen.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Transparenzreport </h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Im Sinne der Mission des Unternehmens, seine Nutzer effektiv zu schützen, veröffentlicht Cyberghost VPN in regelmäßigen Intervallen <a href=""https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/de_de/transparenzbericht"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Transparenzberichte</a> mit detaillierten Zahlen zu den an das Unternehmen gerichteten offiziellen Anfragen, in denen personenbezogene Daten angefordert werden. Die Anfragen stammen von Behörden, Unternehmen und Individuen, um angebliche Straftaten aufzuklären, die unter Zuhilfenahme des CyberGhost-Dienstes begangen worden sein sollen. Da CyberGhost keinerlei Daten protokolliert, gab es bislang in der kompletten Unternehmensgeschichte keine Situation, in denen Daten an Dritte weitergereicht wurden.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Leidenschaft für Internet-Sicherheit</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Robert Knapp, CEO und Mitgründer, begleitet das Unternehmen seit den frühesten Anfängen und leitete es zielsicher durch die Irrungen und Wirrungen des modernen Internets. Sein Herz schlägt eindeutig für Privatsphäre und Onlinesicherheit und so investiert er spürbar mehr Leidenschaft und Zeit dafür, als die andere Seite für dessen Demontage aufbringt. Roberts Motto, dass CyberGhost kein einfaches VPN sei und mehr biete, nämlich Privatsphäre als Service, prägte Team und Unternehmen von Anbeginn und machte CyberGhost so zu einem der populärsten Sicherheitlösungen weltweit. Auf Wirtschafts- und fachbezogenen Konferenzen hält Robert ferner öffentliche Reden zu den Themen einer rundum gefährdeten Privatsphäre und der zum Zweck des Abbaus geopferten Internetsicherheit.<br/></p>

<br/><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: black;""><h2>Wofür CyberGhost steht</h2></a><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Das Internet war für eine kurze Zeit ein weltweiter, sicherer Raum, in dem jeder Mensch erstmals in der Geschichte frei seine Meinung äußern und unbeschränkten, anonymen  Zugriff auf alle Informationen erhalten konnte. Wir glauben, dass es richtig so war und genauso wieder sein sollte!<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Anonym surfen</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CyberGhost VPN verschlüsselt deinen Datenverkehr und verbirgt deine IP-Adresse, indem er sie durch eine andere deiner Wahl ersetzt. Auf diese Weise surfst du anonym und schützt deine Daten vor Datenspionage durch deinen Internet Service Provider, Geheimdienste und Webseitenbetreiber.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Hacker auf Abstand halten und Datendiebstahl vermeiden</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CyberGhost VPN erzeugt einen sicheren, verschlüsselten Tunnel um deinen Datenverkehr und zeichnet keinerlei Anwenderaktivitäten auf. Dadurch verstärkst du die Sicherheit persönlicher Daten wie Passwörter, Bankkonto und Kreditkartendetails – auch in prinzipiell unsicheren öffentlichen WLANs &amp; Hotspots.<br/><br/></p>
<h4>Zugriff auf Inhalte gesperrter Regionen</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mit CyberGhost VPN erhältst du Zugriff auf zensierte oder regional gesperrte Inhalte rund um den Globus und umgehst Zensurblockaden von Sites wie Facebook, Gmail und YouTube durch Regierung, Schule, Universität und Arbeitgeber.<br/><br/></p>

Der #NoSpyProxy befindet sich ab sofort InDemand!
[NACHGEFRAGT: Der
#NoSpyProxy befindet sich ab sofort InDemand! 
Wer auf der
CyberGhost-#NoSpyProxy-Kampagnenseite herumscrollt, erkennt schnell: Das massive
Eindringen der Geheimdienste ins Internet stieß nicht nur auf Gleichgültigkeit,
sondern auch auf aktive Gegenwehr. Wir fanden so viele Unterstützer für ein
abgesichertes Datencenter, dass wir aus Performancegründen Obergrenzen
definieren mussten, und sind jetzt, mit den Erfahrungen eines knappen Jahres
gerüstet, bereit, die immer noch wachsende Zahl Interessenten unterzubringen,
die bislang aus Kapazitätsgründen vor der Tür stehen bleiben mussten. Das
Indiegogo-Feature ‘InDemand’ erlaubt uns die Fortführung der ursprünglichen Kampagne
und so entschlossen wir uns, weitere Mittel für die Fortführung und den geplanten
Ausbau des #NoSpyProxy-Datencenters zu sammeln. Du kannst ab sofort wieder
spenden oder einen Perk anfordern. Lasst uns gemeinsam das Internet privat und
frei halten!]

Die Welt ist eine andere, seit wir mit Gewissheit sagen können, dass gewöhnliche Internet-Anwender nicht mehr nur Hacker und kleinkriminelle Datendiebe abwehren müssen, sondern auch permanente Angriffe geheimer Regierungsbehörden aus dem In- und Ausland, allzu oft sogar mit Hilfe der eigenen lokalen Internet Service Provider.Das einzige Gegenmittel:
Verschlüsselung! Verschlüsselung ist nach dem weitläufigen Versagen moralischer
und politischer Sicherungssysteme die bislang wirksamste Lösung zur
Wiederherstellung von Internetsicherheit und Online-Privatsphäre. Die meisten
Verschlüsselungshürden sind nach wie vor auch für die immense technische
Kompetenz  großer Geheimdienste nicht
passierbar und schützen alleine dadurch, dass sie deren Spionage-Anstrengungen
bis hinter die finanziellen Schmerzgrenzen erhöhen.  



Auch CyberGhost sichert sein VPN-Netzwerk und seine
Anwender in erster Linie durch Verschlüsselung, in diesem Fall durch auf
längere Sicht nicht kompromittierbare 256 Bit AES – unabhängig davon, wo sich
jemand befindet: zuhause, auf der Arbeit, in der Schule, auf Reisen oder in
einem öffentlichen WLAN. Darüber hinaus erfolgt ein Austausch der originalen
IP-Adresse eines Internet-Surfers. Auf diese Weise werden Downloads
und Daten wie Passwörter,
Bankkonten, Kreditkarten, Dokumente und Identitäten in einem nicht abhörbaren
Tunnel übermittelt, während Anwender dort, wo sie die verschlüsselte Umgebung verlassen (um beispielsweise
nicht sichere http-Webseiten zu besuchen), nicht zurückverfolgt und
identifiziert werden können. 
Zu diesem Zweck unterhalten wir ein weltweites Netzwerk mit mehr als 550+ Servern, bieten anwendefreundliche Client-Lösungen für
Windows, Mac OS X, iOS und Android an und unterstützen native VPN-Protokolle
für Linux und Chrome OS, sowie Router, Raspberry und andere Geräte.


Jetzt
sollen die Dinge auf eine höhere Ebene gehoben und die für den Dienst
notwendige Hardware schrittweise unter eigene Kontrolle gebracht werden. Warum?
CyberGhost betreibt als globaler VPN-Betreiber viele Server in zahlreichen
Ländern Europas, den USA und Asien – und die penible  Überwachung der Server ist wichtiger
Bestandteil der alltäglich wiederkehrenden Arbeiten. Hierzu gehören unter
anderem die übliche Wartung der Hard- und Software sowie – eines der elementarste
Kernbereiche überhaupt – die Gewährleistung, dass ein System nicht
kompromittiert worden ist; eingebunden in ein exakt definiertes Prozedere,
deren Einhaltung für ein VPN schlicht überlebensnotwendig ist. 
Aber während
eingebaute Alarmfunktionen und ferngesteuerte Check-ups ausreichend sind, eine
Übernahme auf Softwarebasis auszuschließen, klafft bei Hardwarechecks vor Ort naturgemäß
eine prinzipiell sicherheitskritische zeitliche Lücke im Abschnitt zwischen
zwei Überprüfungen. Nutzt ein Geheimdienst die Chance, einen Server innerhalb
dieser Spanne zu infiltrieren, bleiben dessen Aktivitäten für eine gewisse Zeit
unentdeckt. Ursache hierfür ist, dass keine direkte lückenlose Kontrolle über die weltweit verteilten Server durch
CyberGhost möglich ist. 


Bislang,
denn der nächste logische Schritt in der Entwicklung unseres VPN-Dienstes ist
die Schließung dieser Lücke durch die Einrichtung eigener Datencenter zur direkten
lückenlosen Kontrolle über die weltweit
verteilten Server als weitere, zusätzliche Sicherheitsschicht. Hierzu
investierte das Unternehmen bereits 50.000 EURO aus eigenen Mitteln, benötigt aber
zum Abschließen des Projekts und der Errichtung des ersten Prototypen eure
Hilfe. Zusammen mit euch werden wir das weltweit erste #NoSpyProxy-Datencenter bauen!

Boni (Perks) für unsere UnterstützerDer CyberGhost-Dienst
wird immer eine kostenfreie Komponente haben, weil diejenigen, die ein freies
Internet am dringendsten benötigen, oft leider auch zu jenen gehören, die es
sich am wenigsten leisten können. Euch bitten wir nur, dabei zu helfen, die
Kampagne bekannt zu machen, sofern es kein Risiko darstellt. Vielen Dank im
Voraus!
Als
Anreiz und Dankeschön für die finanzielle Unterstützung des CyberGhost
#NoSpyProxy haben wir verschiedene Perks mit Zugang zum Dienst und vorrangige Verfügbarkeit
der neuen Server vorbereitet, so dass ihr mit deren Inbetriebnahme zu den Ersten
gehört, die ein #NoSpyProxy-Konto oder –Upgrade erhalten.   
Für Neulinge im CyberGhost-Universum ohne Premium-KontoVerfügst du über kein
CyberGhost-Premium-Abonnement, bietet sich unter anderem der ‚Vorzugs-Boarding Perk‘ für € 77,00
an. Du erhältst ein Jahr CyberGhost Premium Plus (mit Sofort-Zugang zu allen 550+ Servern) im Wert von € 79,99
plus vorrangigen Zutritt zu unseren
48 #NoSpyProxy-Servern im Wert von € 59,99 für nur € 77,00 statt zusammen € 139,98.






Für reguläre CyberGhost-Kunden mit aktivem Premium-Konto:
Mit dem ‘Vorzugs-Boarding Perk’ für € 42,00 (Early Bird) erweiterst du dein existierendes Abonnement auf 1 Jahr
Premium Plus inklusive Zugang zu den #NoSpyProxy-Servern. Der gegenwärtige reguläre
Updatepreis beträgt € 19,99,
der spätere Preis für 12 Monate #NoSpyProxy € 59,99. Beides zusammen erhältst du also für
nur € 42,00 statt € 79,98.










Welchen Nutzen bringt ein CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy-Datencenter?Das
moderne Internet ist Schauplatz eines technischen Kriegs geworden, der gegen
uns alle geführt wird, den gewöhnlichen Anwendern! Hacker, Datendiebe und
Regierungsbehörden infiltrieren dank immenser Hightech-Ausrüstung und unterstützt
durch nahezu endlose finanzielle Ressourcen den Kern dessen, was wir ‚das
Internet‘ nennen. Sie machen sich Dienste, Software und Websites ebenso zunutze
wie PCs, Router und Server, mit dem Ziel, alles zu beobachten und aufzuzeichnen,
was wir online unternehmen. Einziges Gegenmittel für diese schleichende
Zersetzung unserer Lebensführung: Verschlüsselung.
Damit der VPN-Dienst CyberGhost eine lückenlose Verschlüsselungskette garantieren
kann, müssen wir über die vollständige und dauerhafte Kontrolle jedes
einzelnen Gliedes unseres Netzwerks verfügen: Login-System, Verschlüsselungsprotokolle, Schlüsselmanagement
und schließlich die Server selbst. Wir erreichen dies im Moment durch Anmietung
oder Kauf dedizierter Server, zu denen nur wir Root-Zugang besitzen
und die wir mit Anti-Spy-Tools vollgepflastert haben. Um aber trotz
regelmäßiger Kontrollen dauerhaft sicherzugehen, dass weder die NSA noch Hacker
physischen Zugang zu einem unserer Server hatten, bauen wir jetzt ein eigenes
Datencenter zur ausschließlichen Verwendung als #NoSpyProxy-Node.



Der erste
CyberGhost #NoSpyProxy ist der Prototyp einer völlig neuen Art Datencenter! Es wird
ausschließlich von unseren zertifizierten Sicherheitsspezialisten installiert
und gewartet und dient ausschließlich dem effektiven Schutz von Internetanwendern rund um den
Globus vor Massenüberwachung, Hackern sowie Daten- und Identitätsdiebstahl. 
Ironischerweise handelt es sich streng gesehen nicht um ein ‚Datencenter‘ im
herkömmlichen Sinn, sondern um ein ‚Keindaten-Center‘, also eine neue
Generation IT-Technologie, die eingesetzt wird, um die Privatsphären der
Menschen und deren Online-Sicherheit zu schützen. Wir nutzen diese ""Blaupause"", um eine ganze Reihe von #NoSpyProxy-Nodes in allen möglichen Ländern und Regionen schnell hochzuziehen, denn unsere #NoSpyProxy-Rechenzentren sind 
platzsparend, einfach zu bedienen, einfach zu errichten und – am wichtigsten –
NSA-sicher!

CyberGhost in der Presse

Warum CyberGhost deine Hilfe benötigt?Nach den Veröffentlichungen von Edward Snwoden glauben wir, dass die Welt eine Reihe von NSA-sicheren #NoSpyProxy-Rechenzentren braucht. 
Die Art und Weise, wie sich ein Unternehmen finanziert, dass
Privatsphäre als Geschäftsmodell betreibt, ist ein wichtiges Detail für das gesamte Projekt. Würden wir auf dem Geldmarkt nach Beteiligunsgkapital suchen, würden wir ein Engagement akzeptieren, das mit Bedingungen verknüpft ist und
wir würden unsere Unabhängigkeit gefährden. Es wäre ebenso grob fahrlässig, den Dienst über Werbung zu
finanzieren. Denn wer für ein Produkt nicht bezahlt wird am
Ende selbst das Produkt. Privatsphäre und werbebasierte Dienste passen einfach nicht
zusammen.

Der beste Weg für Unternehmen wie uns, die aus dem Bedürfnis
nach Sicherheit und Privatsphäre ein Geschäft machen, besteht folglich darin, seine
Anwender direkt um Geld zu bitten. Dadurch geht die Kontrolle auf diejenigen über,
die uns direkt finanzieren: Unsere Anwender. Und die können sicher sein, dass wir - in ihrem Auftrag - unsere Bestes tun, um ihre Sicherheit zu gewährleisten. Oder mit anderen Worten: „Nur die, die für die Musik bezahlen,
bestimmen die Melodie.“
Das Ziel ist die Einnahme von mindestens $ 70.000 aus der internationalen Community
und € 50,000 hier aus der deutschen.





Was geschieht mit den Geldern?Die zusammen € 100.000 fließen
ausschließlich in den Kauf geeigneter Hardware für mindestens 48 #NoSpyProxy-Server
sowie den laufenden Verbindungskosten für ein Jahr. 
Das Geld hilft, das Projekt
aus der Betaphase zu bekommen und unseren Anwendern als Premium-Abo oder Upgrade
anzubieten. Mit etwas Glück kann vielleicht
sogar mit dem Bau eines weiteren #NoSpyProxy-Datencenters
im Ausland begonnen werden, als weiteren Stachel im Fleisch der NSA.

FAQWie kann ich CyberGhost erreichen?
Du findest uns auf allen populären sozialen Netzwerken: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, Reddit. 
Bei Fragen zur IndieGoGo-Kampagne schreibe bitte an indiegogo@cyberghost.ro oder direkt an unser Support-Team unter support@cyberghost.ro.Wie kann ich beitragen? Welche Zahlmethoden werden unterstützt?


Die angebotenen Zahlweisen hängen ausschließlich von
Indiegogo ab. Zurzeit sind dies PayPal und verschiedene Kreditkarten wie Visa,
MasterCard, Discover und American Express. Beachte bitte, dass die Verfügbarkeit
und Akzeptanz einer Kreditkarte auch vom Land abhängt, in dem du lebst, und
dass alle Zahlungen via Kreditkarte ebenfalls von PayPal abgewickelt werden –
unabhängig davon, ob du persönlich ein PayPal-Konto besitzt oder nicht.
Jenen unter euch, die anonym bleiben möchten, bietet
CyberGhost an, via Bitcoin zu zahlen. Bitte kontaktiere indiegogo@cyberghost.ro zu den
Details.

Der übliche Zahlungsdienstleister für
CyberGhost-Produkte, cleverbridge, ist nicht
Teil der Kampagne.Wann wird mein Perk ausgeliefert?


Die Perks, die einen sofortigen Zugang zu den CyberGhost-Premium-Plus-Servern beinhalten, werden so schnell wie möglich ausgeliefert. Spätestens 48 Arbeitsstunden nach Zahlungseingang solltest du deinen Aktivierungsschlüssel erhalten. 
Das Premium Plus-Paket inklusiver Server ist bei allen Perks enthalten, solltest du aber einen Perk mit 'regulärem Boarding' erworben haben, musst du auf den Zugang zum #NoSpyProxy warten, bis der Betabetrieb beendet und das Datencenter in den  Regelbetrieb übergegangen ist. Die Glücklichen mit Vorzugs-Boarding werden im Gegensatz dazu in den ersten Reihen sitzen und bereits Zugriff auf die Betaversion erhalten.
Falls ihr euer Ziel nicht erreicht, wird dann das #NoSpyProxy-Datencenter nicht gebaut?

Selbst wenn wir unser Ziel verfehlen, wird das Datencenter aus den bis dahin eingenommenen und unseren eigenen Mitteln finanziert und errichtet – nur nicht so schnell. Die Dinge verlangsamen sich dann spürbar und andere Projekte (wie unser eigener kabelloser Router oder die Inbetriebnahme eines Accelerator-Programms für Privatsphären-orientierte Startups auf Basis unserer API) werden zurückgestellt.
Bedeutet die Errichtung des Datencenters auch mehr Server für den Free Service? 
Ja, wir werden dem bestehenden Free-Server-Pool neue Server hinzufügen.
Warum Indiegogo? 

CyberGhost VPN ist international und überall auf der Welt verfügbar, wie Indiegogo. Wir haben Anwender in Amerika, Europa, Afrika, Asien und Australien. Unser  Unternehmen wurde von Deutschen gegründet, hat aber seinen Stammsitz in Bukarest, Rumänien, und setzt sich aus Mitarbeitern verschiedener Nationalitäten zusammen. Zurzeit sprechen wir acht verschiedene Sprachen im Team und fühlen uns als Weltbürger pudelwohl. Deshalb haben wir uns für eine Plattform entschieden, die ebenfalls überall auf der Welt verfügbar ist und so nebenbei sowohl PayPal als auch reguläre Kreditkarten als Zahlungsmittel akzeptiert. So erfährt die Kampagne die beste Verbreitung.
Überschätzt ihr euch nicht ein wenig, ein ‚NSA-sicheres‘ Datencenter zu bauen? Das ist eine wirklich große Nummer! 
Um mit Yoda zu sprechen: „Fürwahr, eine große Nummer das ist.“ Aber Yoda hat auch gesagt: „Verloren das Imperium hat.“

Trägt euer CEO Robert jeden Tag ein St. Pauli-T-Shirt?

Nahezu, ja, aber zur allgemeinen Erleichterung trägt er jeden Tag ein anderes, frisches aus seiner umfangreichen Kollektion.  



Bekomme ich wirklich ein lebenslanges Abonnement für CyberGhost? Was bedeutet das? 

Wir versorgen dich mit einem magischen Aktivierungsschlüssel. Dieser Schlüssel ist 99 Jahre gültig und wird in dieser Zeit immer dem aktuell wertigsten Abonnement gleichgestellt. Pure Magie … 
Was bekomme ich, wenn ich das ‘Geschäftskonto’ wähle? 

Du bekommst einen eigenen, privaten VPN-Server zusätzlich zum üblichen Zugriff auf alle anderen Server im Pool. Der Unterschied: Dieser Server ist deine persönliche Heimstatt und du kannst ihn mit bis zu 100 Angestellten teilen, das heißt, du erhältst 100 Aktivierungsschlüssel von uns.
Verfügt ihr über eine Bitcoin-Adresse (BTC), über die ich spenden kann?
Ja, du kannst unsere BTC-Details hier abrufen. Falls du einen Perk wünschst, sende uns deine Daten via indiegogo@cyberghost.ro!
Außer direkt mitmachen, wie kann ich helfen?

Wir begrüßten es außerordentlich, wenn du uns dabei unter die Arme greifst, die Kampagne zu verbreiten und CyberGhost deinen Freunden empfiehlst. Je mehr Menschen bereit sind, Online-Sicherheit und –Anonymität herzustellen, desto besser.

Was zeichnet CyberGhost aus? 

Cyberghost ist ein VPN-Startup mit mehr als 5 Millionen Anwender weltweit. Ziel ist, Internetanwender von den negativen Begleiterscheinungen des modernen Internets zu befreien, also ihnen dabei zu helfen, auf blockierte oder zensierte Inhalte zuzugreifen, ihre Privatsphäre zu schützen und generell mehr Sicherheit herzustellen, während sie online sind. Wir möchten die Freiheiten des frühen Internet wieder herstellen und in die nächste Generation retten!


No Track Policy!
Führen wir Weblogs, protokollieren wir das Surfverhalten der Anwender oder zeichnen wir Inhalte, besuchte Webseiten oder die IP-Adressen unserer Anwender auf? Nein! Warum nicht? Menschen in undemokratischen und unfreien Ländern (also möglicherweise auch DU!) befinden sich bereits in unmittelbarer Gefahr für Leib und Leben, wenn sie ihre Meinung öffentlich äußern. Implementierten wir Hintertüren, Deep Packet Inspektionen oder zeigten uns generell offen für das Ansinnen von Behörden und Regierungen, Informationen über unsere Anwender aufzuzeichnen, gefährdeten wir deren Leben. Wir werden dies nicht tun! Niemals!
Jederzeit und für jedermann einfach anzuwenden

Mit CyberGhost VPN bleibt effektiver Internetschutz nicht länger Experten und Nerds vorbehalten. Die Software ist supereinfach zu bedienen und liefert auch dem unerfahrensten Anwender per simplem Mausklick sofortige Online-Sicherheit und –Privatsphäre mit (auch vom US-Militär genutzten) 256 Bit AES. Wir halten bequem anzuwendende Applikationen für Windows, Mac, iOS und Android zum Download bereit sowie einen kostenlosen Web-Proxy für Anonymität während des Surfens und ein Chrome-Add-on zur Verschleierung der IP-Adresse direkt und einfach in deinem Browser.
Globales Netzwerk 

CyberGhost verfügt über mehr als 550+ Server in multiplen Standorten in 31 Ländern rund um den Globus. Alle Server sind mit 256 Bit AES verschlüsselt und bieten sowohl schnelle Verbindungen als auch breiten Zugang zu blockierten Inhalten in anderen Ländern. Anwender können nach Belieben ihren Standort wechseln, wann immer sie als Surfer einer bestimmten Region gelten wollen.
Blitzschnelle Verbindung
Unser Traum ist, einen Sicherheitspuffer für dich zu erschaffen, den du nicht bemerkst, während du surfst oder downloadest. Aus diesem Grund drehen wir stetig an den Optimierungsschrauben für Geschwindigkeit UND Sicherheit. Wir verfügen über Gigabit-Server mit innovativen Hard- und Software-Konfigurationen; der selbstgebaute #NoSpyProxy ist dabei der nächste Schritt zur perfekten Ausrüstung.
Sicherheit made in Europe
CyberGhost hat seinen Standort in der Europäischen Union und operiert unter rumänischer Gesetzgebung, was uns das Recht gibt, KEINE Logs anzulegen und die Identitäten unserer Anwender effektiv zu schützen. Die Chancen, ein Privatsphären-Unternehmen auf dem Territorium der ‘Five Eyes’-Mitglieder Australien, Kanada, Neuseeland, dem Vereinigten Königreich und den USA zu führen, ohne gezwungen zu sein, Anwenderdaten zu erfassen und zu speichern, sind dagegen gleich Null.
'Offene Türen' statt 'Offener Quellcode'
Der Heartbleed-Bug in OpenSSL hat gezeigt, dass 'Open Source' nicht zwangsläufig als sicher gelten kann, nur weil theoretisch der Quellcode für alle offen einsehbar ist. Wir glauben, dass Transparenz und 'best practice' wichtiger sind. Darum sind wir bereit, Bürgerrechts- und Netzaktivisten sowie Mitglieder von NGOs in unseren Unternehmensräumen zu empfangen, um sowohl die Lokalitäten als auch den Quellcode unabhängig überprüfbar zu machen. Externe Audits, kombiniert mit 'best practices', sind der beste Weg, einen hohen Sicherheitsstandard zu etablieren.  CyberGhost ist als Unternehmen mit den Sicherheitsstandards ISO 9001 und ISO 27001 zertifiziert; unsere Sicherheitsingenieure besitzen individuelle CompTIA-Sicherheitszertifikate und befinden sich ständig in Aus- und Weiterbildung zur Anpassung an veränderte Anforderungen.
Transparenzreport 
Im Sinne der Mission des Unternehmens, seine Nutzer effektiv zu schützen, veröffentlicht Cyberghost VPN in regelmäßigen Intervallen Transparenzberichte mit detaillierten Zahlen zu den an das Unternehmen gerichteten offiziellen Anfragen, in denen personenbezogene Daten angefordert werden. Die Anfragen stammen von Behörden, Unternehmen und Individuen, um angebliche Straftaten aufzuklären, die unter Zuhilfenahme des CyberGhost-Dienstes begangen worden sein sollen. Da CyberGhost keinerlei Daten protokolliert, gab es bislang in der kompletten Unternehmensgeschichte keine Situation, in denen Daten an Dritte weitergereicht wurden.
Leidenschaft für Internet-Sicherheit
Robert Knapp, CEO und Mitgründer, begleitet das Unternehmen seit den frühesten Anfängen und leitete es zielsicher durch die Irrungen und Wirrungen des modernen Internets. Sein Herz schlägt eindeutig für Privatsphäre und Onlinesicherheit und so investiert er spürbar mehr Leidenschaft und Zeit dafür, als die andere Seite für dessen Demontage aufbringt. Roberts Motto, dass CyberGhost kein einfaches VPN sei und mehr biete, nämlich Privatsphäre als Service, prägte Team und Unternehmen von Anbeginn und machte CyberGhost so zu einem der populärsten Sicherheitlösungen weltweit. Auf Wirtschafts- und fachbezogenen Konferenzen hält Robert ferner öffentliche Reden zu den Themen einer rundum gefährdeten Privatsphäre und der zum Zweck des Abbaus geopferten Internetsicherheit.



Wofür CyberGhost steht
Das Internet war für eine kurze Zeit ein weltweiter, sicherer Raum, in dem jeder Mensch erstmals in der Geschichte frei seine Meinung äußern und unbeschränkten, anonymen  Zugriff auf alle Informationen erhalten konnte. Wir glauben, dass es richtig so war und genauso wieder sein sollte!
Anonym surfen
CyberGhost VPN verschlüsselt deinen Datenverkehr und verbirgt deine IP-Adresse, indem er sie durch eine andere deiner Wahl ersetzt. Auf diese Weise surfst du anonym und schützt deine Daten vor Datenspionage durch deinen Internet Service Provider, Geheimdienste und Webseitenbetreiber.
Hacker auf Abstand halten und Datendiebstahl vermeiden
CyberGhost VPN erzeugt einen sicheren, verschlüsselten Tunnel um deinen Datenverkehr und zeichnet keinerlei Anwenderaktivitäten auf. Dadurch verstärkst du die Sicherheit persönlicher Daten wie Passwörter, Bankkonto und Kreditkartendetails – auch in prinzipiell unsicheren öffentlichen WLANs & Hotspots.
Zugriff auf Inhalte gesperrter Regionen
Mit CyberGhost VPN erhältst du Zugriff auf zensierte oder regional gesperrte Inhalte rund um den Globus und umgehst Zensurblockaden von Sites wie Facebook, Gmail und YouTube durch Regierung, Schule, Universität und Arbeitgeber.

INTRODUCTION


You know those dull days we all have from time to time? The days that are so boring and you can’t come up with anything to do? You just sit around and roll your thumbs. We hate those days and we think we're not alone to do so. That's why we want to bring you The Pointless App, because it is the cure for days like that.


WHAT IS THE POINTLESS APP?
Yes, what exactly is The Pointless App then? Well, the idea is quite simple. The Pointless App gives you proposals on pointless but entertaining things to do when you are really bored. You download the app and then you just swipe to the left to get the proposals. It is possible to share the proposals on social media or ask a friend to do one of the pointless things you find in the app. New pointless suggestions will be added regularly. Our goal is to help you stay entertained even when there's nothing around to be entertained by. And with your help we hope to achieve this goal.




  
WHAT DO WE NEED YOUR HELP FOR?
The funding for this app will make it available and functional for everyone. It will also make it possible for us to add new proposals every now and then and develop both the functions and the user interface. Every little penny counts, so even if we don't reach our full funding goal we will still be able to develop and improve some of the apps functions.

<p>Ken Starks' voice is scarred by cancer treatments, but his message is clear. A child's exposure to technology should never be predicated by the ability to afford it. <br/></p>
<p>Ken recently gave the closing keynote address to a full house at the Ohio Linux Fest this year.  He brings us a unique, touching and sometimes funny look into what it is he does. He puts rebuilt computers into the homes of financially disadvantaged school kids. You can see keynote video below</p>

<p>We come to the Indiegogo community specifically for a good reason. You 
folks offer us funding opportunities that grants can not. <br/></p>
<p>Ken has been a friend and a productive member of the global Linux Community since 2002.  He is also the founder and Executive Director of <a href=""www.reglue.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reglue</a>. They are located in Taylor Texas and serve the entire Central Texas area. <br/></p>
<p>Since 2005, the 501(c)(3) organization has placed 1600+ donated then refurbished computers into the homes of financially disadvantaged kids in Central Texas. From their annual summer workshops to the 90 day <a href=""http://linuxlock.blogspot.com/2012/01/move-over-barbiegirls-want-tech.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Girlz-R-Geekz-2</a> mentoring program and the 9 public learning labs they put together, they take pride in what they do. But Ken's volunteers and directors state their message clearly.<br/></p>

They are all armed with a Reglue desktop and/or laptop. <b>With your help</b>, over the next year, we will place 200 computers into the homes of kids who cannot afford one. We also help our Reglue Kids get online by paying for the first 90 days of internet connection. This gives them time to budget for the expense of having the internet available in their homes. As overused as the term is, the Digital Divide is alive and well in some parts of America. We will bridge that divide where we can.<br/><h3></h3>

<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</b>
</p>
<p>We are aiming for an entire year's funding for our organization. $9000.00 is what it will take to operate for the next year. but $18,000.00 gives us enough money to buy a badly-needed vehicle. Ken's personal vehicle is what we're using now and it turned over 300K this past May. Breakdown isn't the worry point here, it's metal fatigue of the frame and supports. We've suspended transporting our Reglue kids until we can assure their relative safety. She's truly on her last legs.</p>

<br/><p></p>Free or discretionary spending grants have all but disappeared. These charitable foundations want proof that we spent their grant money on stuff like office space, various equipment and even computers. We have all of that. What good is being granted a vehicle if we can't afford the fuel to do computer installations? Or to buy the parts needed to fix that computer? The majority of grant foundations are simply not offering assistance to help with those things any more. The ones that do offer extremely small amounts of money and that cash wouldn't last us three months. We can't use those small funds but others might so we don't call upon that resource.<br/>

</div>All-Righty Then.<br/></div>","We are Reglue. Putting Technology into the Hands  of Tomorrow.

Ken Starks' voice is scarred by cancer treatments, but his message is clear. A child's exposure to technology should never be predicated by the ability to afford it. 
Ken recently gave the closing keynote address to a full house at the Ohio Linux Fest this year.  He brings us a unique, touching and sometimes funny look into what it is he does. He puts rebuilt computers into the homes of financially disadvantaged school kids. You can see keynote video below

We come to the Indiegogo community specifically for a good reason. You 
folks offer us funding opportunities that grants can not. 
Ken has been a friend and a productive member of the global Linux Community since 2002.  He is also the founder and Executive Director of Reglue. They are located in Taylor Texas and serve the entire Central Texas area. 
Since 2005, the 501(c)(3) organization has placed 1600+ donated then refurbished computers into the homes of financially disadvantaged kids in Central Texas. From their annual summer workshops to the 90 day Girlz-R-Geekz-2 mentoring program and the 9 public learning labs they put together, they take pride in what they do. But Ken's volunteers and directors state their message clearly.


We've watched our ""Reglue Kids"" grow as they've entered college, with some entering graduate studies. They are all armed with a Reglue desktop and/or laptop. With your help, over the next year, we will place 200 computers into the homes of kids who cannot afford one. We also help our Reglue Kids get online by paying for the first 90 days of internet connection. This gives them time to budget for the expense of having the internet available in their homes. As overused as the term is, the Digital Divide is alive and well in some parts of America. We will bridge that divide where we can.


What We Need & What You Get.

We are aiming for an entire year's funding for our organization. $9000.00 is what it will take to operate for the next year. but $18,000.00 gives us enough money to buy a badly-needed vehicle. Ken's personal vehicle is what we're using now and it turned over 300K this past May. Breakdown isn't the worry point here, it's metal fatigue of the frame and supports. We've suspended transporting our Reglue kids until we can assure their relative safety. She's truly on her last legs.


Free or discretionary spending grants have all but disappeared. These charitable foundations want proof that we spent their grant money on stuff like office space, various equipment and even computers. We have all of that. What good is being granted a vehicle if we can't afford the fuel to do computer installations? Or to buy the parts needed to fix that computer? The majority of grant foundations are simply not offering assistance to help with those things any more. The ones that do offer extremely small amounts of money and that cash wouldn't last us three months. We can't use those small funds but others might so we don't call upon that resource.

We've been an open and transparent organization since the beginning. Our legitimacy and presence is easily accessed online and we've proven to be exactly who and what we say we are. You can always find out more about us by just using your search engine of choice and searching ""reglue computers"".
We don't possess the ability to adequately describe the moment when a 
child first turns on her first computer. We have been extremely fortunate
 to have seen this hundreds of times. We sincerely wish you could see 
though our eyes what your donations make possible. Your money goes to 
working toward biomedical engineering graduate degrees. It goes to a 
kid's first IDE and introduction to python. It goes to help a struggling
 single parent who has to answer these questions month after month:
*Is it new shoes for the kids this month, or is it a computer?
*Is it money for a class school trip or is it a computer?
*Is it paying the electricity bill this month or is it a computer?

We are offering some great perks this year. This list is not by any means complete...we will be offering more as the campaign builds up some steam. On the list of perks will be a number of refurbished laptops, anywhere from a Dell Intel i7 XPS L401X quad core with 8 gigs of RAM and a 500GB hard drive to Lenovo Thinkpads, ranging from a Lenovo T420 Intel i5 with 12 gigs of RAM with docking station to a number of Lenovo T60 and 61 dual cores. We also have an Acer 11.2 inch Chromebook with a 320 gig hard drive and 4 gigs of RAM plus a Lenovo S10-3 Netbook for your donation consideration. The Dell E6520 laptops we offer are an extremely nice machine and reasonably priced.
We will offer Ms. Carla Schroder's fantastic all-inclusive how-to book, The Book Of Audacity. This is the definitive work on the music app ""Audacity"". This actual book is no longer available at No Starch Press. We have only a few of these autographed books so when they are gone...well, they'll be gone. O'Reilly Press has a list of 10 books they've donated for our perks. You can see them in the perks column on the right.
And for you Sci-Fi and fantasy fans, we have a special treat. For a $10 dollar donation you can enjoy the complete Time Weaver Chronicles trilogy by award-winning author Thomas
 A. Knight in a DRM free eBook format of your choice (mobi, epub or 
PDF).  
""This Amazon best-selling series follows Seth Alkirk and his 
adventures in Galadir as he discovers that he's not human, but a Time 
Weaver who can control time. The fate of his new-found home rests in his
 hands as he discovers how to control his powers, learns who he really 
is, finds love, and navigates a world filled with magic, dragons, and 
other wondrous creatures"".If we don't meet our funding goal, we will judiciously use your donations to do as much good as we can with what we have.
  Our Impact


Your donation goes to insure that a kid has a level playing field in school and when competing with other students for grades and SAT Scores.
Our organization is fortunate to have an active pool of over 100 volunteers.

<h2>A Brief</h2>
<p>Few decades back, email came
into existence. Our communication was changed drastically with this new electronic
medium. Since then, many other
technological evolutions have happened in field of internet communication. We have
instant Messaging, File Sharing, online photo galleries, social networking are some examples.  These all somehow depend on email service
(right from registration, verification or notifications). But the core of email
is still the same, not much have changed in terms of email. It is still limited to message and max attachments.<br/></p>

A lot of new and advanced email clients have
been developed, but none of them actually tried to enhance the email service.
With lot of efforts, finally we are able to present you a email client &amp;
engine, which is more secure, Flexible and powerful. We named it <b>atom.email</b>.  It is going to give
a new great life to our email service. <b>It is email reborn.<br/><br/></b><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/698118/files/20140706175308-4C-Concept.jpg?1404694388"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
</h3><h2>Why it is most needed in today’s world?</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>Privacy and Security</b></p>
<p>We know very well, that how our communication system was exploited by agencies, governments and
our privacy was invaded badly. Atom.email
protects us from all such agencies, as it has inbuilt <b>multiple methods for encryption</b>,
which keeps all your communication protected and encrypted. Security is just click away, No add-ons, no plug-ins
required.</p>
<p><b>Powered Emailing</b></p>
<p>Till now email
has been used just to send messages or pictures /documents as attachments. Atom.email
brings you a powered emailing. We have developed an email engine, which can
render your email in many ways. Now, email can be used to collect data,<span>  show photos as gallery,  play music or video files, file sharing, task
creation, event management and much more. All this now is possible just via
emailing.  Chat, e-books, Notices and much more is integrated into email. Communication and content will be centralized at one place across all devices for the same user.<br/></span></p><p><b>Spam Protection</b></p>
<p>Most of email
clients provides a good level of spam protection. Atom.email provides you an
auto verification of the sender with CAPTCHA form.<span>  As per your settings, Anyone who sends you email first time, needs
to verify himself as genuine user. Along with that,  atom.email will maintain a central Anti-SPAM server,
to list all bad users. </span></p>
<p><b>3rd Party Apps<br/></b></p>
<p>We all use many different apps to communicate with our friends and family. We use facebook, twitter, instagram  and many more. This gives us one challenge, that content shared or received from these apps, is not useable via others. Now with atom.email you can do it. You can use atom.email apps for these social networks, and keep your data centralized and also backup. e.g. Twitter tweets can be backed up automatically in atom.email, for your reference.</p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/698023/files/20140706164357-SourceCode.jpg?1404690237"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote>""  We believe that user needs to have confidence in the software, he is using.

</blockquote><p></p><h2>
<b>Lets understand little about encryption.</b><br/>

Few decades back, email came
into existence. Our communication was changed drastically with this new electronic
medium. Since then, many other
technological evolutions have happened in field of internet communication. We have
instant Messaging, File Sharing, online photo galleries, social networking are some examples.  These all somehow depend on email service
(right from registration, verification or notifications). But the core of email
is still the same, not much have changed in terms of email. It is still limited to message and max attachments.

A lot of new and advanced email clients have
been developed, but none of them actually tried to enhance the email service.
With lot of efforts, finally we are able to present you a email client &
engine, which is more secure, Flexible and powerful. We named it atom.email.  It is going to give
a new great life to our email service. It is email reborn.
Why it is most needed in today’s world?

Privacy and Security
We know very well, that how our communication system was exploited by agencies, governments and
our privacy was invaded badly. Atom.email
protects us from all such agencies, as it has inbuilt multiple methods for encryption,
which keeps all your communication protected and encrypted. Security is just click away, No add-ons, no plug-ins
required.
Powered Emailing
Till now email
has been used just to send messages or pictures /documents as attachments. Atom.email
brings you a powered emailing. We have developed an email engine, which can
render your email in many ways. Now, email can be used to collect data,  show photos as gallery,  play music or video files, file sharing, task
creation, event management and much more. All this now is possible just via
emailing.  Chat, e-books, Notices and much more is integrated into email. Communication and content will be centralized at one place across all devices for the same user.Spam Protection
Most of email
clients provides a good level of spam protection. Atom.email provides you an
auto verification of the sender with CAPTCHA form.  As per your settings, Anyone who sends you email first time, needs
to verify himself as genuine user. Along with that,  atom.email will maintain a central Anti-SPAM server,
to list all bad users. 
3rd Party Apps
We all use many different apps to communicate with our friends and family. We use facebook, twitter, instagram  and many more. This gives us one challenge, that content shared or received from these apps, is not useable via others. Now with atom.email you can do it. You can use atom.email apps for these social networks, and keep your data centralized and also backup. e.g. Twitter tweets can be backed up automatically in atom.email, for your reference.""  We believe that user needs to have confidence in the software, he is using. So, we are sharing full source code with every user who support this project. It will be under commercial license, but source will be open. No hidden agenda or backdoor in system is possible, if source code is provided.  ""

Lets understand little about encryption.
When we talk about privacy, we talk about encryption. To encrypt anything, you need encryption software/library to execute in some environment. This can be server, browser or your local device.  We are not discussing hardware embedded encryption.   Atom-Email supports three types of encryption methods.  All applications will be provided in full source to every user. They can choose what they feel best to their need. User doesn’t need to be programmer to do anything.  It is just click away.  Always keep in mind, Every Encryption is linked to key, and you need to store key at most safe possible place. 1.  Server based Encryption ( Recommended,  only if you trust your host server)2.  Browser based Encryption  ( Least Recommended)3.  Local Device Apps ( Highly Recommended, You are the Boss, you have full control on local device)In Server based encryption, there are two important things. 
Host Server 
Connection to Server.
Atom.Email support PGP encryption on Linux servers based on public-private keys. You can install atom-email  on your host server and enable encryption. Your connection to your server needs to be secure, to protect your data streams between your server and your device.If you trust SSL/TLS.a.  There are speculations that spy agencies have already break the SSL security or at least they know how to bypass it and can read your data stream.  But if you still can trust SSL certificates, then you can use server based encryption program.b.  If you don’t trust SSL, then you need to do encryption, before you send data via SSL. That means, it can be your browser or your local device.Browser Based encryption are done using JavaScript. There are many open source projects, in progress to make it successful. Atom-email has enabled its interface with OpenPGP.js and SJCL encryption libraries.  Both are open source projects. We will be releasing the modified source code along with our code to all the users.But, Browser based encryption has its own risks. But still, it’s better than no encryption. So, in case you cannot use server based or local device based encryption, then you can use Browser Based Encryption.Remember this, in Browser based encryption, the keys will be either stored on server or in your local cache (HTML5 DB).  Local cache keys will be restricted and limited only to the website, which created that key.  It is not much recommended by us to use browser based encryption.We are also working on Encryption Extensions for browsers.  Extensions (with known source) are better than the JavaScript fetched from remote server for encryption.(End to End Encryption)This is the best possible solution as of now.  As encryption will happen on your local device independent of application and browser and then only encrypted data will be send via atom-email to end point. AS you have full control on your device, and with full source code of encryption library, you can trust your encryption. Keys will also will remain in your local device. It won't be on server neither on browser local cache. Atom-email can work with any 3rd party encryption application also, if they provide any way to communicate and encrypt-decrypt data. Another good reason for this encryption is, that you can also use it outside atom.email. You can encrypt any files, documents, media etc. Atom-email will be releasing native apps for all devices. We are already working on these apps. 
Centralize Device Content Management
Atom.Email gives you a great feature ""DSM"" Data Sharing Manager to manage your content on different devices. DSM  is one of the Core Functionality of Atom.Email. DSM allows user to share data between devices from one central control point. DSM gives you ability to control what to share and on what device. You can also set DSM for Auto Sync or Backup to Cloud.  From your Atom.email File Manager, you can manage files on any device connected to your account (as per permissions).  It is just easy drag-drop system. It keeps log of edit and access history of any document.  You can even Manage contacts on different devices. DSM works with Security Manager for Encryption on Files. You Can setup from single file to full folder or multiple folders to be encrypted. Files will be sent on network as encrypted files and will be decrypted at receiving end.

should you donate? –
Your donations would be
greatly appreciated because we need your support to make this dream come true
in creating one of the most innovative and convenient products to carry with
you on the go.  Donations will go towards
completing all potential developmental steps; including tooling, molds,
engineering, circuitry development, parts, certification, packaging etc., all
leading to final production.Help us create one of the most convenient and portable
devices to carry on the go.  When
traveling, we always find ourselves carrying various devices, such as wall chargers,
wireless routers, external batteries, data
cables that cause a tangled mess!  With
the HooToo TripMate Elite, say goodbye to
untangling!  Other devices that are
similar on the market, does not have as many features as the HooToo TripMate
Elite.  The HooToo TripMate Elite has 5 features built
into one small package and uses a three-layered circulation cooling system, so
no need to worry about overheating, regardless of all of the features that are
packed into one small package. - 
Personal Cloud
Storage- 
Portable Travel
Router- 
Wi-Fi Hotspot- 
6,000mAh External
Battery Charger- 
Built-in AC Adapter
Until now, most similar devices on the market do not have
all 5 features built-in, and/or are too bulky to carry on the go.  Weighing at only 7.15 oz, the HooToo TripMate Elite
can easily fit into a backpack, purse, or any carrying bag on the go!  The HooToo TripMate Elite has amazing
features to keep you up and running; whether on the road for a business trip or
on a road trip with friends.Features at a glance:·

Cloud Storage / Media Sharing:Running out of storage space on your smartphone or
tablet?  Do you find yourself constantly
deleting files on your device just to clear up space?  The Wireless Media Streamer/File Transfer
feature works wonders for those who have limited space on their mobile devices,
as you can create your very own personal cloud. 
 The HooToo TripMate Elite is
a portable sized adapter that can make any USB storage device in a wireless
file server.  USB mass storage devices
(flash drives, USB hard drives, card readers, etc) are one of the most commonly
used digital storage media.  However,
with products such as the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices, it is impossible
to connect a USB storage device.  With the
HooToo TripMate Elite, cross-platform data
sharing is easy to manage. Simply transfer media files, such as photos/videos/music/documents
between iOS, Android, and Windows devices – or plug in any USB mass storage
device (external hard drives, memory sticks, etc.) and access all of your content
without using any wires.  All of this can
be done with a simple and free application called “HooToo TripMate.”  Just think of it as your very own portable
multimedia server – where you can enjoy movies, TV shows, and music anywhere on
the go.  With the HooToo TripMate Elite, you can share your media files with up to 5 devices simultaneously. Don’t
settle for the limited storage space on your phone – have more freedom with the
TripMate Elite and create your very own personal cloud!Portable
Wireless Router (Wi-Fi Hotspot Capable):
Don’t have an unlimited data plan?  Are you a frequent traveler and find yourself
at locations (hotel rooms, classrooms, etc.) with only wired internet
access?  With the TripMate Elite, it can
function as a portable router and turn any wired connection into an instant Wi-Fi
Hotspot! Simply plug the Ethernet network cable, start up the TripMate Elite,
and you’re ready to connect your mobile devices wirelessly through multiple mobile
devices.  This feature also allows
multiple devices to access the internet at the same time, which works wonders
because wired connections are only limited to one device at a time.  The TripMate Elite is the perfect solution
for your network needs when you are away from home. 
6,000mAh
Power Bank / External Battery:Do you find your smartphone or tablet on low battery all
of the time, with no wall outlet around to charge your device?  The TripMate Elite runs on 6,000 milliamps per
hour (mAh) batteries by Samsung, and can be used as an external battery, where
you can charge your mobile devices on to the go.  If you find yourself always low on battery
power, this is a handy device to keep in your bag.  It is possible to use your mobile device
while it is connected to the TripMate Elite while charging – which means you
can watch videos for longer periods of time. 
TripMate Elite  has 2 USB (1amp
and 2.1amp) ports so you can charge two devices
at the same time.  The HooToo TripMate Elite is capable of
charging USB-based charged devices, such as smartphones, tablets, digital
cameras, MP3 players, and much more. 
Not only is the external battery convenient for everyone,
but it also provides a peace of mind without having to worry about
your battery power. Built-in
AC Wall Adapter - You can charge the TripMate Elite either by a standard
USB cable, or use the built-in AC adapter – just simply flip the prongs out and
plug it into any wall outlet.  You can
charge your mobile devices while the TripMate Elite is charging too! Packaging:For our packaging, we wanted to create something
eye-catching, classy, and simple. The package will include the HooToo TripMate
Elite, carrying pouch, and extra charging cable.Manufacturing- HooToo already has our

Personal Fabricator as a standard build platform, without any 
modification. The FABTOTUM PRISM platform is a 6.5cm thick box composed 
by a vat mount (where light-curing resin is poured) and the optical 
assembly. A build platform is also mounted on the FABtotum carriage, and
 provide the surface on wich the print grows layer by layer.<br/><br/>As with many other upgrades, Prism is compatible with existing FABtotum 
Personal Fabricators, and it can be purchased separately by all Fabtotum

 is a new manufacturing technology that merges the advantages of 
Selective Laser Sintering  (SLS) with the precision of Digital Light 
Processing (DLP).<br/>Most DLP printers relies on integrating 
commercially available DLP home projectors wich are expensive and are 
not designed for 3D printing.<br/>Only a small amount of energy emitted by a DLP projector actually cures the resin!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440167764/u4megvmjktgp0rnkbuu4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>PRISM
 relies on a much simpler and widely available technology that recently 
reached the level of pixel density required to compete with DLP systems:
 the LCD matrix.<br/>Resin is cured by shining a light with the right 
wavelenght throught the liquid crystals matrix. Where the matrix is 
polarized light is absorbed and radiations are absorbed, creating 
shapes.<br/>Most similar systems are using a simple UV LED array which is
 expensive, produces excessive heat on the delicate LCD and is only 
capable of delivering a few mW/sqmm of light radiation. <br/>In PRISM, instead, a mirror and a set of collimated light emitters are focusing high UV radiation on parts of the LCD matrix.<br/>This reduces the energy used and decreases curing times.<br/> <br/>PRISM
 can deliver more energy per unit of area at a fraction of the cost. and
 it does so only where light is needed, instead of everywhere, wasting 
energy and time.<br/><br/>Because of that, PRISM printing speeds depends on the Area cured, like Selective laser synthering systems.<br/>For
 bigger prints it's in line with other SLA/DLP systems, while for 
smaller areas it's much faster than conventional DLP systems,SLS and 
LED-LCD systems.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440169164/clrqouzbwaj8slhomhan.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Since
 the energy output is much bigger, PRISM can cure very small portions in
 a small amount of time, where other systems with fixed output such as 
DLP require much more time to solidify smaller obbjects due to the low 
energy emitted per area. <br/>While conventional solutions are not 
scalable, PRISM can virtually reach much higher radiation levels with 
the same setup by increasing the number of the light emitters.<br/><br/><b>DETAILS MATTER</b><br/><br/>FABtotum
 PRISM is able to produce the smallest detail at around 80 µm in XY, 
while the smallest step in Z is 0.47 µm (that's 0.00047mm!).<br/>While 
these specs are in line with what is expected in the final consumer 
version, keep in mind that small design changes in the optical assembly 
may improve or lower the quality accordingly as we experienced during 
the alpha prototyping phase.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440146999/arihm4x2l8nfjmv7h2po.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Above, a Planar closeup view of the XY matrix, below: what it means.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440166553/iny4neogpbufwcqsqk2a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The
 precision of the PRISM platform is mostly due to the structure of the 
FABtotum wich is capable of producing single movements of 0.25 
micrometers in XY and 0.47 micrometers in Z natively, with high torque.<br/>This
 kind of fine control does not only help when playing with very thin 
layers, but removes resonances in the Z direction, a nasty problem that 
many not-so-cheap 3D printers have.<br/><br/><b>MULTIPURPOSE PERSONAL FABRICATION</b><br/><br/>We
 developed the FABtotum PRISM to be an extension of the FABtotum 
Personal Fabricator. FABtotum Personal Fabricator PRISM bundle includes 
the FABtotum Personal Fabricator and the PRISM addon. PRISM is also 
available separately as an addon for existing units.<br/><br/>PRISM installs easily, requires minimun calibration and allows to quickly get started with SLA manufacturing. <br/>When not needed, PRISM can be removed and the FABtotum can be used to print mill or scan as usual.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440153360/wo01jrvdpythtq3ttmie.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>The PRISM head is mounted on top of the FABtotum carriage.<br/>This

With FABtotum PRISM you get the most flexible and advanced multipurpose manufacturing device ever conceived, capable of 3D Printing in SLA with light-curing resins or with FFF on Materials like PLA, PETG, ABS as well as NYLON, HIPS, PC, 3D Milling Foams,Brass,Wood,Aluminum and acquire 3D point clouds and models via multiple 3D scanning methods with the built-in hi-res camera, touch probe and laser.Design and create small or big components with a huge variety of materials, acquire 3D shapes, modify existing designs and print them in multiple materials and with different technologies as you see fit. FABtotum PRISM brings design and personal fabrication to a whole new level.While there can be ""better"" manufacturing technologies. There is no ""better"" manufacturing technique.With the addition of the PRISM Stereolithography manufacturing 
technology you are now able to reach unprecedented levels of details and
 complexity on top of the capabilities of the FABtotum Personal 
Fabricator.FFF/FDM does not produce fine details and can only work with a limited amount of polymers. Engraving is precise and works with lots of materials but require some fiddling with CAM and CAD. DLP and SLS are precise but can be expensive for big volumes and are limited to certain Light-activated resins.FABtotum PRISM adresses that.THE FABTOTUM PRISM PLATFORMThe FABtotum Personal Fabricator was designed to be a flexible and expandable platform from day one. Not Just a 3D printer, not Just a milling machine, Not just a scanner. A new way of prototyping and creating objects.With expandable heads, swappable platform and up to 5 axis of motion the FABtotum is the most customizable platform for Personal Fabrication ever conceived on the market today.The FABtotum is capable of printing autonomously (without being connected to a computer), from cabled LAN, Wireless LAN and even remotely from the Internet (Your Network must be properly configured for this), thanks to the FAB UI, the FABtotum User Interface. Also, users and developers have access to a well known development ecosystem, the Raspberry Pi's Raspbian Linux distribution to develop more applications. The FABtotum feature a customized web management app, SSH and VNC server on the local network, so with one authorization code you can access all the functions of the machine: 3D Printing, 3D scanning, Milling, Costumizations and Maintenance.All these function are accessible not only from anywhere in your local network, but also on any device with web browsing capabilities. print remotely from your smartphone, tablet, your windows Pc, Mac, Linux, Android, IOS. You can use touch screens devices, mouse, keyboard - you name it!The FABtotum has been used in many fields and by different people, sometimes without any specific knowledge of Machining or 3D printing. What is PRISMPRISM is installed inside the FABtotum 
Personal Fabricator as a standard build platform, without any 
modification. The FABTOTUM PRISM platform is a 6.5cm thick box composed 
by a vat mount (where light-curing resin is poured) and the optical 
assembly. A build platform is also mounted on the FABtotum carriage, and
 provide the surface on wich the print grows layer by layer.As with many other upgrades, Prism is compatible with existing FABtotum 
Personal Fabricators, and it can be purchased separately by all Fabtotum
 owners.PRISM
 is a new manufacturing technology that merges the advantages of 
Selective Laser Sintering  (SLS) with the precision of Digital Light 
Processing (DLP).Most DLP printers relies on integrating 
commercially available DLP home projectors wich are expensive and are 
not designed for 3D printing.Only a small amount of energy emitted by a DLP projector actually cures the resin!PRISM
 relies on a much simpler and widely available technology that recently 
reached the level of pixel density required to compete with DLP systems:
 the LCD matrix.Resin is cured by shining a light with the right 
wavelenght throught the liquid crystals matrix. Where the matrix is 
polarized light is absorbed and radiations are absorbed, creating 
shapes.Most similar systems are using a simple UV LED array which is
 expensive, produces excessive heat on the delicate LCD and is only 
capable of delivering a few mW/sqmm of light radiation. In PRISM, instead, a mirror and a set of collimated light emitters are focusing high UV radiation on parts of the LCD matrix.This reduces the energy used and decreases curing times. PRISM
 can deliver more energy per unit of area at a fraction of the cost. and
 it does so only where light is needed, instead of everywhere, wasting 
energy and time.Because of that, PRISM printing speeds depends on the Area cured, like Selective laser synthering systems.For
 bigger prints it's in line with other SLA/DLP systems, while for 
smaller areas it's much faster than conventional DLP systems,SLS and 
LED-LCD systems.Since
 the energy output is much bigger, PRISM can cure very small portions in
 a small amount of time, where other systems with fixed output such as 
DLP require much more time to solidify smaller obbjects due to the low 
energy emitted per area. While conventional solutions are not 
scalable, PRISM can virtually reach much higher radiation levels with 
the same setup by increasing the number of the light emitters.DETAILS MATTERFABtotum
 PRISM is able to produce the smallest detail at around 80 µm in XY, 
while the smallest step in Z is 0.47 µm (that's 0.00047mm!).While 
these specs are in line with what is expected in the final consumer 
version, keep in mind that small design changes in the optical assembly 
may improve or lower the quality accordingly as we experienced during 
the alpha prototyping phase.Above, a Planar closeup view of the XY matrix, below: what it means.The
 precision of the PRISM platform is mostly due to the structure of the 
FABtotum wich is capable of producing single movements of 0.25 
micrometers in XY and 0.47 micrometers in Z natively, with high torque.This
 kind of fine control does not only help when playing with very thin 
layers, but removes resonances in the Z direction, a nasty problem that 
many not-so-cheap 3D printers have.MULTIPURPOSE PERSONAL FABRICATIONWe
 developed the FABtotum PRISM to be an extension of the FABtotum 
Personal Fabricator. FABtotum Personal Fabricator PRISM bundle includes 
the FABtotum Personal Fabricator and the PRISM addon. PRISM is also 
available separately as an addon for existing units.PRISM installs easily, requires minimun calibration and allows to quickly get started with SLA manufacturing. When not needed, PRISM can be removed and the FABtotum can be used to print mill or scan as usual.The PRISM head is mounted on top of the FABtotum carriage.This
 allows the FABtotum to move the build plate around and moving to the 
next layer with ease thanks to 3 axis of motion and our unique COREXY 
variant configuration, one of the strongest XY systems out there!ADAPTABLEWhy investing in a 3D printer nowadays? It looks like 3D printingy technologies are changing so fast that committing to a particular one would be an error.The FABtotum is a flexible platform that has been built with longevity in mind, because instead of the cutting edge last-month techology it's built around the concpt of multifunctionality and adaptability.As with many other upgrades, PRISM itself is compatible with existing FABtotum 
Personal Fabricators, and it can be purchased separately by ALL FABtotum
 owners.PERSONAL FABRICATIONPersonal Fabrication is not the act of manufacturing.
I’ts not about the tecnology or who uses it. it’s not even “the tool”.
it’s in ""process and the interactions"" it makes possible.When you puth togheter more than one manufacturing technology strange things happens. you find yourself building complete objects and functional projects, you explore different design choice and fabrication approaches.A new paradigm was needed, exposed in a device both simple to use, 
solid, modular, customizable and flexible, and useful if you are a geek,
 an engineer, a designer, a jewel maker, a 3d modeler, or just 
interested in 3d printing .
There is more to Personal Fabrication than 3D printing alone.That’s when we realized we needed a new paradigm: thus the FABtotum was born.OPEN SOURCEBeing able to manufacture and produce things is a right.For this reason we don't want to restrict access to hybrid manufacturing technologies and solutions.All our products designs are open source, you can check them here.

Chuwi HiGame has a space gray finish with a simple aesthetic that would look great on your desk. We have shaved away every unneeded millimetre to create a super space-saving design. At just two liter volume and with a weight of just 1.3Kg, it’s a pro-gaming and creating desktop computer that can actually sit on your desk. Moreover, we have added two specially designed square-shaped metal rings for Chuwi HiGame — meaning it can be placed on your desk in different ways (horizontal or vertical) without affecting the cooling.Chuwi HiGame comes with the newly announced 8th Gen Intel Core i5-8305G or i7-8709G processor. Featuring a cutting edge design, it can deliver four cores, eight threads and up to 8MB of cache memory. Thanks to Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, you will see a turbo frequency of up to 4.1GHz. In addition, with up to 40% higher performance versus previous-generation processors, you can seamlessly multitask with efficiency on Chuwi HiGame.What’s more,backed up by cutting-edge Radeon RX Vega M GL/GH graphics (customized from AMD), Chuwi HiGame can easily handle a lot of graphics-hungry applications. It’s directly connected to the CPU via Intel’s high-speed PCIe lanes. This allows the bandwidth needed for the CPU to feed the graphics compute units (up to 24 Compute Units) to run up to 1190MHz boost frequency which delivers super smooth frame rates on your favorite games. The final touch is the low power dedicated graphics memory that comes in the form of 4GB of High Bandwidth Memory Gen2 (HBM2) with class leading memory bandwidth up to 205GB/s, to quickly store and retrieve information critical for a great graphics experience.With pre-installed 8GB DDR4 RAM onboard, the Chuwi HiGame can offer seamless multitasking and lag-free switching between lots of resource hungry software. With the built-in dual-channel DDR4 controller running at 2133/2400MHz, it will support up to 32GB of memory in total and delivers up to 38.4GB/s of memory bandwidth. That’s 50% more bandwidth and 40% more energy efficiency than DDR3 technology. All of these optimized designs let you fly through even the most compute-intensive tasks in no time. Chuwi HiGame comes pre-installed with the 128GB/256GB M.2 SATA solid state drive (SSD) -which is up to 5 times faster than most hard disk drives (HDD). This will let you boot up, launch apps, and even open massive files in blazing-fast times. And if you are looking for more space to house your movie/music libraries or install more professional software and games, we have designed Chuwi HiGame to support three different types of storage expansions — 2.5-inch hard disk drive (HDD), M.2 SATA solid state drive (SSD) or PCIe x4 NVMe solid state drive (SSD). So whether the larger storage capacities or faster data access speeds, you can mix and match between HDD and SSD to better suit your needs.Chuwi HiGame packs an unprecedented amount of power in an unthinkable amount of space. We know therefore, that the cooling system is very important. In addition to using multiple copper heat sinks and a 90mm astonishingly quiet fan to cool the processor and graphics card, we have also specially engineered our own unique design of all-around vents to keep the temperature down. All-around vents are designed on the left, right and bottom sides to efficiently pull in cool air to help offset heat from the Chuwi HiGame's crucial components. Equipped with this multi-layer thermal system, Chuwi HiGame will undoubtedly ensure the peak performance for even your most demanding gaming battles!Designed with multiple input/output connectivity ports, the compact Chuwi HiGame can furnish you with all kinds of ports for different types of peripherals.It lets you  easily connect to the internet, displays and many of the USB-A based external devices.There is also one front-mounted Thunderbolt 3 port, this versatile USB-C based port can conveniently support up to 40Gb/s transfer speed, two 4K UHD 60Hz displays or an additional external graphics card (eGPU) Chuwi HiGame gives you superfast wireless connectivity, thanks to its Intel Wi-Fi card.

<p></p></div>","Innovation from your pocket We are working on a software and hardware open-source project for accelerating “Internet Of Things” (IoT) startups and hobbyist prototypes. We would like the startups to be exciting. We think the shape of IoT is a combination of the smartphone and sensors. So we are going to provide a smartphone application library and reference hardware.We call the project “Physicaloid”.The PocketDuino is the first piece of hardware for the Physicaloid project.Let's make things, together!　私達PhysicaloidプロジェクトチームはAndroidとArduinoを繋ぐためのオープンソース・ソフトウェアおよびハードウェアのプロジェクトを進めてきました。そのリファレンスハードウェアの第一弾としてPocketDuinoを作りました。そしてみなさんの手に届けたいと思っています。　何かアプリケーションを作るとなると、どうしてもソフトウェアとハードウェアの間にある技術的な溝がネックになります。正直なことを言うと、両者を繋げるのはすごくめんどくさい作業です。そこで私達は、その間の溝を埋めるためのツールを揃えてきました。なるべく敷居を下げるために各センサ毎にArduinoスケッチ、Android Java ライブラリを用意しています。　このプロジェクトへの支援・参加方法には2つの側面があります。1つは、このプロジェクトをベースに自身のアプリケーションを実現すること。そしてもう１つはこのプロジェクト自体にジョインしてベースを作っていくこと。私は、前者が多く参加し面白いアイデアがたくさん出てくることを期待しています。そして、あまりにこの環境がひどいと思ったら後者としてジョインして下さい。　私達はどんなことでもアウトプットすれば世界が変わると思っています。そして誰もが違うアウトプットをすることに価値があると思っています。私達は、皆が思い描いた何気ないアイデアが形となって出てくる世界を見たいと思っています。そして、その世界をあなたと一緒に作りたいと思っています。$1からでも私達のプロジェクトにジョインしてくれることを願っています。Anytime and anywhere, you can develop The PocketDuino is an Arduino-compatible development board with a micro-b USB connector. It can be attached to an Android device directly. No need for an extra battery. Anytime and anywhere, users can develop, test and get feedback.PocketDuinoはmicro-bUSBコネクタを備えたArduinoピン互換の開発ボードです。Androidに直接差し込んで使うことができます。追加電源は要りません。いつでもどこでも気軽に開発でき、その場で友人と楽しみ、時にはアプリに対するフィードバックを得ることができます。The PocketDuino Features

</div></div>","The DrinkSnap Story

Fact - Friends and Family move; get married, graduate college, finish the military Fact - We enjoy buying our friends and family members drinksFact - Now you don't have to be sitting next to them to do it.

DrinkSnap is a user friendly Mobile App and combination social website designed to do what has been going on for generations in Pubs, Bars and Restaurants and that is people buying each other drinks.  Now, with DrinkSnap, you don’t have to be sitting next to them to do it.  With the free  App and Website people can now send a friend or friends a drink anytime, from anywhere at participating locations.





Moving 1800 miles away from one of my best friends was tough.  We loved hanging out and it was always ""I got this one"".  After the move that feeling never left me.  I missed a lot.  His kids, my adopted nephews and niece, were getting married and he was becoming a grandpa and I was on the other side of the country.







So to celebrate the monumental occasions, of course, a toast was required but I wasn't there.  When they want out to celebrate, I tried to give my credit card number over the phone to a bartender/bar manager to purchase a beverage in celebration.  But, noooo - It was against their regulations was what I was told, and I respected that, but it was a Big bummer.  So I thought ""there has to be a better way"" and that's how DrinkSnap was evolved.  The website is www.drinksnap.com.  You can go to the Google Play Store and search drinksnap (No spaces) to download.  Working on the Apple store App, and partially why we need a boost from the Indiegogo community - more below.

We need to raise capital to bring DrinkSnap to the masses and be made available to every bar, restaurant and neighborhood pub that wants more people in their seats.

The Impact - ATTN: MERCHANTS

</div></div>","Greetings, Fellow Robot Futurists!


Currently I am working on some interesting robot ideas, and would like to develop them further.


The two ideas are the Automatic Food Slicer Robot (AFSR) and a moonshot-in-progress project that is all about motors. You can read more details, below.


This campaign is to raise the funds for parts and fabrication costs so we can build an improved version of AFSR, and also experiment with our moonshot-in-progress idea.


AFSR was accepted to be shown in the Innovation Showcase at Maker Con (before Maker Faire NY), so funds from the campaign will also be going towards some travel costs.



Automatic Food Slicer Robot


The Automatic Food Slicer is an accessibility robot, bringing confidence and safety to those who have difficulties cutting food.


Overview video:





See it in action:





Right now AFSR uses a rack & pinion & gear set to move up and down (Z-axis). Two drive motors to push/pull the entire robot (X-axis). The end effector is easily removable for cleaning. There is a servo that can tilt the knife.






It’s controlled with an Arduino Mega. There’s a nRF8001 breakout board for connecting via BLE to the iPad app I developed. The gesture controller is a breakout board called Hover. You can read about the development of the robot here.







Although the motors are quite weak and the structure not very rigid, AFSR was able to slice through playdoh.






Goal
We were thinking that it would be great to have the goal of the robot being used to slice food for people. What better timing than the holidays... so the deadline is set for improving the robot!



Moonshot-in-Progress


What if we could make all of the inanimate objects around us come to life by applying “motor tape” and making them actuate?


Overview video:



We were inspired by the moonshot thinking from the Solve For X program.



Huge problem
The aging population and their decrease in motor abilities.



Radical solution
Adding actuators to everything, all the objects around us could be manipulated. They would even be able to sense and automatically move based on previous patterns.



Breakthrough technology
We want to make something like an LED but for motors. Something that can be added to a circuit board easily. When they are placed in a certain pattern, then some type of movement will occur. Adding these components to flexible material like Pyralux could make the motor tape idea happen.
Currently, we have three ideas for the tech. Piezo speakers, inductors, and the magnetic micro-robots. For an overview, see the above video.
This is the aspect that we are working on now. We want to experiment with the little piezo components, but just need some help with the parts cost and board fabrication. It should be a lot of fun.



Outreach


To get people interested in these robot ideas, or just robots in general, there will be themed hangouts. Everyone will be able to watch the hangouts, but only those with a ticket will be invited to join. Don’t worry, we will still be doing the Robot Party hangout too! 


Build-a-thonI will be working on one of the robots, and you can be working on your robots too! Feel free to ask questions. We can discuss what is and is not working. This would be like a virtual hackerspace type of hangout.Tele-opWe will attach a Google+ Hangout extension that will allow anyone in the hangout to control the robots.

We will be discussing this during the hangout and possibly other subjects as well.


The number of the hangouts will depend on the number of tickets sold, since 10 people can be in one hangout at a time.


Rewards



Hangout Ticket
See the above ‘outreach’ section for all the details. We will send out a survey that will allow you to input what hangout you pick and what your Google+ is so we can add you to our circles.



Robot Signature
Some ink on paper, perhaps artistic, as drawn by AFSR. We will also add inspirational words to it, just in case the signature isn’t exciting enough. It will be sent in an envelope.



Robot Friends
Tokens picturing robots we have created! This one is special, because we are friends with robots and they will be friends with us. It will be sent in a small envelope package.



“ART”
Sometimes our 3D printer does not print a piece properly- it warps, the extruder stops running, and more. Alternatively, sometimes we just messed up and designed a piece wrong. We will send you some of our 3D print fails. It will either be sent in an envelope package or a tiny box. Own a piece of EPIC FAIL history and put it on your wall! xD

Also, make sure you have some wire (22 AWG, solid or stranded) for attaching to the motors and buttons.


Please note: Shipping for this kit is separate- you will have to pay for it via Paypal when we will be ready to ship them out. This is because we will have a more accurate pricing understanding when the box is packed. It will probably range between $10-$25 CAD -- thanks for understanding!



Dream Sponsor and Moonshot Sponsor
This is a real boost to help us. Each video that we make, there will be a slide at the end that will say thanks to the backers, and your name will be there too (unless you do not want it to be). We will also add your initials to one of the pieces on the updated AFSR robot. Thanks for supporting crazy robots in progress!



Parts


Some of the parts we are looking for are stepper motors, steel rods, surface mount piezo speakers (really tiny ones), surface mount inductors, and the list continues on. We’re experimenting.
If you happen to have any of these parts, or if you have any parts that you think might be interesting for learning more (like solenoids, that would be cool) -- and they are looking for a new home, leave a comment and we can correspond if they would be useful! Stuff like this helps! :D

About & History


Hi there, my nickname online is RobotGrrl, and I have a passion for creating robots. Working on programming, electronics, and the mechanical design can be quite challenging at times. But it is extremely fun, as well as sharing the knowledge and enthusiasm with others! Check out my website for other robots that I’ve built.






I’m excited for a future where more things that surround us will be robots. They will be able to sense and actuate, and detect our patterns for determining when and where they will move.



If you are getting started in robotics, you might be interested in my RoboBrrd kit -- which was funded successfully here on Indiegogo a few years ago.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The use of high speed processors in modern laptops and other electronic devices leads to higher rates of heat generation that need to be dissipated efficiently. Our patented technology actively detects, monitors and reduces laptops temperature during intensive tasks for increased CPU performance. Rather than simply blowing air at the laptop like traditional external cooling pads, linedock's patented technology generates real cold: down to 10°C on the top surface. The cooling mechanism actively sucks heat from the bottom of the laptop, allowing it to perform better, when it matters. *This feature is only available on the linedock 15"".* </p>

We stand for USB-C. Amazed by its power of integration, we spent the last 12 months pushing it to the limits. We brought our expertise and passion for design to create a unique device offering power, space and unity.  The line-u cable is the world's first dual USB Type-C connector designed for maximum speed data transfer. Made out of flexible rigid polymer, its unique and U-shaped design allows for easy and stable connection between your linedock and laptop. Light indicators located on both sides of the cable indicate the level of charge of the connected USB-C device, displaying an orange light when charging is in process or a green light once the device is fully charged. A game changing accessory for all USB Type-C laptops.

Each laptop requires a certain amount of power in order to be charged adequately.

Yet most USB-C power banks do not provide sufficient output, leading to incompatibility issues (no charging/slow charging) which in turn can significantly damage your laptop battery.

linedock is the only power bank on the market capable of charging any USB-C powered laptop at the fastest speed.  




linedock is endowed with the very first engineered adaptive power management system able to supply up to 100W of charge.

The use of high speed processors in modern laptops and other electronic devices leads to higher rates of heat generation that need to be dissipated efficiently. Our patented technology actively detects, monitors and reduces laptops temperature during intensive tasks for increased CPU performance. Rather than simply blowing air at the laptop like traditional external cooling pads, linedock's patented technology generates real cold: down to 10°C on the top surface. The cooling mechanism actively sucks heat from the bottom of the laptop, allowing it to perform better, when it matters. *This feature is only available on the linedock 15"".*

<p>Our smartphones are powerful enough to keep us connected, entertained and ready to get work done on the go, but the small screen size tremendously limits working efficiency. It’s annoying to constantly switch between different tabs and windows or cram multiple apps and files onto one little screen.  We all know a secondary monitor helps a lot, it makes everything easier to manage and more efficient but they are typically bulky, heavy, and inconvenient. </p>

</div></div>","Our smartphones are powerful enough to keep us connected, entertained and ready to get work done on the go, but the small screen size tremendously limits working efficiency. It’s annoying to constantly switch between different tabs and windows or cram multiple apps and files onto one little screen.  We all know a secondary monitor helps a lot, it makes everything easier to manage and more efficient but they are typically bulky, heavy, and inconvenient. 
 

 
Introducing AirTab, your best productivity-boosting partner. A 15.6” portable monitor that weighs a mere 1.1 pounds, is just 0.19 inches slim and makes the perfect secondary display for your devices. It's super affordable, easy to use, and instantly expands your screen real estate for dual-monitor presentations, processing documents, coding, multimedia and more. Its versatility helps you get things done more efficiently when you’re on the go. 
 

 

 

 
                                        Find the NotebookCheck review here. 
 

 
 

 
With AirTab, your productivity and efficiency gets a boost wherever you are, transforming your smartphone into an expansive high definition display that lets you get more done. 
 

 
 

 
Unlike other bulky monitors, AirTab is the lightest 15.6” touchscreen portable monitor ever created, weighing only 1.1 lb and measuring just 0.19 inch thick. That means it’s thin enough to easily slip into your backpack or laptop sleeve, next to your laptop, without you even noticing. 
 

 
 

 
The AirTab package comes with a smart magnetic cover that protects it from dust and scratches. More importantly, the cover can be folded into a kickstand to prop the monitor up in either landscape, portrait, or creation mode.
 
Landscape Mode
Extending the monitor when multi-tasking is quick and efficient using horizontal orientation. 
 

 
Portrait Mode
Portrait mode gives you a perfect extended view of items such as documents, books, mobile websites or when you are coding. 
 

 
 
Creation Mode
Turn it around, lay it down, and here comes the creation mode. AirTab makes movies more enjoyable and is excellent for design, photography and other creative work. 
 

 
 

 
Leave the mouse at home and enjoy unparalleled control using the AirTab 10-point touchscreen. The intuitive and super responsive touch capabilities enhance accuracy and multitasking efficiency. 
 

 
 

 
The dual USB-C ports allow you to connect AirTab with many different devices, including laptops, smartphones*, Nintendo Switch, cameras, and more. 
 

 
*Requires smartphone that supports USB-C 3.1.
 
AirTab was specifically designed for compatibility with your most essential mobile devices. It’s ultimately portable, delivering a laptop-like experience when using your phone without the added weight. With AirTab, your productivity doesn’t decrease just because you are on the go.

Charge Your Devices via USB-C
Your host device only requires a single USB-C connection for both power and video transmission when connected with AirTab. The reversible (any-way-up) USB-C design facilitates quick and hassle-free link to support devices.

<p>Owning a portable handheld game console capable of running AAA games such as GTA5, has always been the dream of many gamers. But even the best handheld consoles on the market like the PSP and PSV struggle to run these games. Better game console performance normally requires a device that’s sizable enough to have sufficient processing power and is able to withstand long battery use and overheating.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515569307/p1hmjguj7z92cpr6fkx2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our GPD WIN 2 comes in compact form but doesn’t sacrifice game play experience. GPD WIN 2’s lightweight design and heavyweight hardware processing power allows it to achieve ultimate compactness with minimum heat output and long battery life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515391617/e2lvjwanvdyncua15jst.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Last year, we successfully launched the GPD WIN, the first 5.5-inch Windows handheld game console in the industry. The significance of this machine lies in the fact that many games that could only be played in front of a television or a computer in the past. Now, for the first time, these games are able to run on a portable handheld device. However, we understand that the first generation GPD WIN had some deficiencies, especially in the area of performance and heat dissipation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515404035/pam3ympd0lv6dtzghysr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At GPD, we are committed to develope a handheld game console that can run AAA games smoothly. At the same time, the heat-dissipation, power consumption, device weight, portability, battery-life and other factors will also be taken into account. Thus, we have gone through a long product development time to introduce to you a new generation of our product: The GPD WIN 2.</p>

The XD was very successful and has been widely loved by PSP, NDS and arcade gamers.</p><p>Later, we found that there were many games on the Windows platform, but there was no handheld console that could support these games. So we launched the GPD WIN. The introduction of this PC gaming handheld was a sensation both locally and abroad, though it is not perfect.</p><p>The introduction of the WIN has laid the foundation for us to launch the WIN 2. The WIN 2 makes up for many deficiencies of our first product and has made a major breakthrough in terms of performance, heat dissipation, appearance, ergonomics and other aspects of the system.</p><p>The reason why this crowdfunding was launched on Indiegogo, was mainly due to the high cost of: R&amp;D, molds and materials. All the money we raise will go into volume production of this product. We believe that this product will thrill all players who love handheld gaming and it will be handheld PC gamer’s first choice for years to come. We sincerely hope that you can support this project. Let’s work together to make the GPD WIN 2 a reality.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515394352/bstg2nc3quwiqsbribvb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515394367/gtsp25u7t02unbqqmzqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We are a company focused on handheld gaming products and office equipment based in Shenzhen, China.

But even the best handheld consoles on the market like the PSP and PSV struggle to run these games. Better game console performance normally requires a device that’s sizable enough to have sufficient processing power and is able to withstand long battery use and overheating.

Our GPD WIN 2 comes in compact form but doesn’t sacrifice game play experience. GPD WIN 2’s lightweight design and heavyweight hardware processing power allows it to achieve ultimate compactness with minimum heat output and long battery life.

Last year, we successfully launched the GPD WIN, the first 5.5-inch Windows handheld game console in the industry. The significance of this machine lies in the fact that many games that could only be played in front of a television or a computer in the past. Now, for the first time, these games are able to run on a portable handheld device. However, we understand that the first generation GPD WIN had some deficiencies, especially in the area of performance and heat dissipation.

At GPD, we are committed to develope a handheld game console that can run AAA games smoothly. At the same time, the heat-dissipation, power consumption, device weight, portability, battery-life and other factors will also be taken into account. Thus, we have gone through a long product development time to introduce to you a new generation of our product: The GPD WIN 2.







The gaming improvement of the WIN 2 is very obvious. The following is a performance comparison between the WIN 2 and previous generation WIN. It shows game frame rate results for the WIN 2 and WIN:

* Testing resolution: 1280×720. Unless otherwise stated, the game uses low special effects.

“Grand Theft Auto 5” maximum settings at 38fps;
“Heroes of the Storm” 60fps, team battle at 38fps, with an average of 49fps;
For “Overwatch”, its framerate on menu screen is 120fps, 80fps when walking in the map, and a stable value of 50-70fps when in during matches, with an average of 83fps;
“League of Legends”, even on maximum settings, 60fps can be achieved, heavy action sections at 48fps, an average of 54fps;
“DOTA2” maximum settings at 70fps;
“The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim” with average of 53fps;
“World of Warcraft” with an average of 30fps.

The most powerful handheld ever, the appearance design was developed by a German Red Dot Award winning team.

The product supports more than 1,000,000 internet games. Enjoy gaming the second you open the box.
The WIN 2 is equipped with a 6-inch touch screen from Sharp Corporation with a viewing angle up to 178°. The screens area has been increased by 9% compared to the previous generation WIN. It also utilizes In-Cell full lamination technology and fourth generation Corning Gorilla Glass. With a screen resolution of 1280×720, it has a ppi 2.53 times greater than that of a typical 24-Inch desktop monitor. The WIN 2 also has a capacitive touch screen.
Featuring a seventh generation Intel® Kaby Lake Core™ m3-7Y30 processor, with performance close to that of the Intel® Core™ i7-3770K. With its CPU-Z single-core performance score of 1244 points, there is no stutter running the latest AAA-class games when using low game effects.
Complimenting the m3-7y30 CPU cores, the m3-7y30 also features 9th generation Intel® HD Graphics 615 with 24 EU execution units and a maximum dynamic frequency of 900MHz. Game frame rates have increased by a factor of 2.2 times compared to the previous generation GPD WIN. Games are smoother and looks more realistic.
The device features a M.2 2242 port, with extremely high read/write speed capability. Game loading is 4 times faster compared to a mechanical hard disk or eMMC.
Equipped with 2×4900mAh large-capacity and high-density polymer lithium batteries. The GPD WIN 2 has a maximum game play battery-life of over 6 hours. Our product is also the first game handheld to support PD 2.0 fast charge, allowing the battery to be charged to half full within 45 minutes.
Brand new gamepad design with two 3D joysticks from ALPS Japan, featuring built-in dual-vibration motors to ensure that you get immersed in the game. You can sense even the slightest vibration with unparalleled comfort during gameplay.
Designed with an innovative PC-class cooling solution, It features a high-power turbofan which can adjust rpm dynamically from 2000 to 8800rpm. When the temperature of the CPU core is between 20 ℃~80 ℃, the 60-speed dynamic temperature control will kick in to best balance efficiency
WIN 2 can be charged through mobile power based on PD 2.0 or PD 3.0. At the same time, WIN 2 can also provide the power for your mobile device, such as mobile phone.
For a long time, we have thought about how to best design our handhelds in an ergonomic, aesthetic and commercially valued way.We are pleased to announce that the design of the GPD WIN 2 has been done in cooperation between GPD and the Red Dot Award winning design team. We feel the design of the WIN 2 has achieved the best balance of aesthetics, engineering and ergonomics.The frame of the lid is made of light, strong magnesium alloy material to prevent the screen bending. The rounded edge design shows more affinity. The black removable ABS cover can be replaced with other zinc alloy cover. Alternatively, you can also decorate it with your own metal or adhesive stickers. Enjoy personalizing the style of your GPD WIN 2 to your taste.To keep the WIN 2 lightweight, the main body of the WIN 2 uses ABS material. The sunken design of the joysticks allows seamless access to the other game controls. Unique arc metallic film keys, which make it more suitable for blind operation. The 360 style ABXY buttons, still use screen print double-character for their labels. The machine body, keyboard and gamepad use colors which bring out the best of the design. With an elegant matt UV finish, it provides the user with a delicate feel. The machine has been artistically designed with a fine balance of colors and material application.The trigger keys: L1/L2/L3, R1/R2/R3 are situated at the back of the WIN 2 near both corners. The interface ports are also on the back and comprise of: Type C USB, 3.5mm headphone, USB 3.0, Micro SD card slot, Micro HDMI. The hot air outlet is also situated at the rear. The quite compact layout, brings out the best of the design.The bottom surface of the WIN 2 has been designed with a covered slot to enable easy user replacement of the M.2 SSD card. The M.2 SSD card is fixed in place using screws, which effectively guarantees that the SSD is connected with the M.2 interface, even when the WIN 2 is shaken or in the extreme drop state.The design of the air inlet on the side of previous WIN model makes it easier for them to be blocked by hands when holding the machine, which has been widely criticized. This time around, the air inlet of the WIN 2 has been designed in the bottom surface. The fan then forces hot air out the back of the machine. Hot air only travels a short distance before it exits via the back vent, extracting heat from the machine in nearly no time. In limited tests, the temperature of the machine can be controlled at about 39 degrees.Equipped with a 6-inch Super-Shine screen from Sharp Corporation, the viewing area has increased by 9% compared to the previous generation. Using In-Cell full lamination technology, the screen is thinner due to the reduction of a piece of glass. By applying the fourth generation of Corning Gorilla Glass, the intact rate of a 1-meter drop test is as high as 80%, and damage reduction shows a 45% improvement compared to Gorilla Glass 3. Protective design with no prominent frame, allows you to focus on your gaming. Side and upper screen borders have been kept to a minimum, with an upper border of only 5mm and a lower border of only 3mm. The screen resolution is 1280×720, it has a PPI 2.53 times greater than that of a typical 24-Inch desktop monitor. The viewing angle is up to 178°. The WIN 2 also has a capacitive touch screen.Equipped with the seventh generation ultra-low voltage Intel® Kaby Lake Core™ m3-7Y30 Processor, fabricated using advanced 14nm technology. Under the same power consumption, it can deliver about 12% performance improvement compared to the previous generation Skylake technology. The bus speed of Intel® Core™ m3-7Y30 can reach 99.76MHz, with OPI bus speeds up to 4GT/s and peak data transfer of 4×10^9 times. Together with 4MB L3 cache, it greatly reduces the time to retrieve data from memory.Due to the increased number of transistors and architecture optimizations, the m3-7Y30 is significantly better than the x7-Z8750 used in the previous generation GPD WIN. The improvement in the measured performance of the m3-7y30 is quite obvious. The CPU-Z single-core performance reaches 1244 points, almost 4 times that of the x7-Z8750. Multi-core performance reaches 2688 points, 2 times that of the Z8750. The overall performance is close to the third generation Intel i7-3770K.The emergency response speed of the m3-7y30 has increased significantly thanks to Speed Shift technology which can instantly boost CPU Turbo. Compared to the 0.1 second response time of the m3-6y30, the response time of the m3-7y30 is only 0.005 seconds, killing nearly all the stutters in team battles.Utilizing 9th generation Intel® HD Graphics 615 with 24 execution units (EUs) and a maximum dynamic frequency of 900MHz, the WIN 2 graphics performance surpasses that of its predecessor which uses Intel’s 8th generation HD Graphics 405, with only 16 EUs and a maximum dynamic frequency of only 600MHz.When parallel processing graphics data in a high throughput situation, the HD Graphics 615 performance is up to 220% better than the discrete graphics NVIDIA GeForce GT240. Coupled with the fact that the system resolution is not that high, the WIN 2 can easily cope with the latest AAA games when using low game effects.* AIDA64 scores denote the sum of the Read, Write, Copy score. Only PCmark Vantage represents the score of the memory.The m3-7y30 only supports LPDDR3 which has a maximum operating frequency of 1866MHz. Compared to the previous generation of Z8750, the memory frequency has increased by 1.17 times. With dual-channel design, bandwidth up to 128bits, the effective wait time is reduced by 50%, enabling games to run more smoothly. RAM increases to 8GB which is twice as that of previous generation WIN.* The tested SSD is Transcend / Transcend TS512GMTS400 512GB. Continuous read/write testing is based on CrystalDiskMark for performance evaluation, and the random read and write testing uses CrystalDiskMark QD32 for performance evaluation.The WIN 2 features an M.2 2242 socket interface. It comes standard with a 128GB M.2 SSD. The SSD adopts SATA 3.0 based on the AHCI protocol, which has a theoretical bandwidth of up to 6Gb/s, and a theoretical transfer speed of up to 600MB/s.The M.2 SSD can be easily replaced. Players can buy 256GB, 512GB or higher capacity SSD to replace the original one. There is no capacity limit, which means it can store more games, videos and applications.As an example of SSDs speed, we tested the read speed of the Transcend TS512GMTS400 512GB SSD (which is not the standard SSD in the WIN 2). Read speeds for this card reach 560MB/s, and write speeds reach 460MB/s. This hardware configuration design enables the machine to reach the optimal overall performance of the system, there is no system configuration bottleneck.At the player’s request, the WIN 2 retains the Micro SD card slot. The m3-7y30 supports UHS 104 ultra-high-speed SD interface, and the bus bandwidth is up to 104MB/s, which perfectly supports Micro SDXC cards.* The Micro SD card used in the test is SAMSUNG 128GB (model number: MB-MC128D); test software: ATTO Disk Benchmarks V2.47.We performed a speed test using the SAMSUNG 128GB (Model: MB-MC128D) USD card on the WIN 2. The tests showed read speeds up to 86MB/s, and write speeds up to 55MB/s. These results are 2.04 times better than achieved on the previous generation WIN console, taking full advantage of its bandwidth. The price advantage of Micro SD is quite obvious compared to SSD, and the read/write speed is not lower than that of eMMC. The Micro SD is therefore a powerful complement to the WIN 2 storage options.The following table is based on the current situation of the maximum capacity of storage devices on the market, from which we can calculate that the maximum scalable storage capacity of GPD WIN 2 is 2.912TB:* The above products are the maximum capacity that can be obtained in mainland China, but it does not mean that there is not larger capacity options in other regions. As long as it complies with the interface specification, our GPD WIN 2 can also support the storage.Set the mode switch to X to enter the Xbox 360 gamepad mode. The gamepad still remains the style of WIN, using Japanese ALPS double-3D joystick, with the sunk-style design, which is improved to reduce operational errors.On the left side is a classic cross style D-Pad, which enables fast and accurate directional movement. On the right is the Xbox 360 style action buttons, labeled using a screen print double-character, faster and more accurate with finger touch.L3/R3 trigger buttons are located on the back of the WIN 2 together with L1/R1 and L2/R2. The newly designed trigger buttons make it easy for players to reach the buttons quickly, making the overall gaming experience better.WIN 2 is also equipped with two vibration motors. It’s insane level of vibration effect will help you get more immersed in the game. The two vibrating motors are extremely powerful, providing you with an unsurpassed experience in both racing and shooting games. Each game has a unique and appropriate vibration mode. When playing shooting games, you can feel the recoil of the gun pushing you backward; when starting a car engine, you can feel the vibration of the engine as if you were really sitting in the car. Even the slightest vibration can be sensed, making you more immersed in the game than ever before.The WIN 2 keyboard has been designed to cope with more than 1 million key presses. Key travel has been set to avoid fatigue from long typing sessions. The keyboard has an excellent feel. THE WASD, left, right, up and down keys are designed in a protruding style, which makes PC keyboard gaming easier. The concave power button has been designed to avoid inadvertent presses. In the upper right corner of the keyboard, there is the Xbox key, which can serve as “home button”, “screenshot button” etc.When the mode switch is set to the mouse mode, WIN 2 will simulate a mouse using the joystick.Mouse control is important for PC games, as such, the WIN 2 joystick can be used to simulate a mouse. Also, in order to meet the needs of different players, the mouse speed can be increased by pressing the L2 button. If you need faster mouse movement speed, you can press the L2 button to increase the mouse speed by a factor of 2.In order to extend the battery-life, WIN 2 uses 2×4900mAh large-capacity and high-density polymer lithium batteries, with 7.6V output, 37.24Wh of power and 600Wh/L energy density. Its battery capacity is increased by 49% compared to the previous generation WIN, the battery’s power delivery efficiency has been increased from 82% to 95%. The large batteries enable the WIN 2 to deliver an outstanding gaming battery life of over 6 hours. At the same time, our product is also the first game handheld to support PD 2.0 fast charge which can charge the battery to half full within 45 minutes.In addition, the charging logic of the WIN 2 has been changed. When in charging mode, the motherboard is directly powered by the source supply rather than through the battery. The WIN 2 can support a maximum power supply of 12V/2A. When the power supplied by the charger is not enough to fully power the WIN 2, the battery will supply the power needed in order to ensure better performance and longer runtime of the WIN 2.To enhance the cooling effect, the WIN 2 is designed with a PC-class cooling solution utilizing a high-power turbofan. The fan has a dynamic speed ranging from 2000 to 8800rpm. With large-volume side-blown thermal outlet design and ultra-short outlet distance, the hot air exhaust performance is 8 times greater than that of the previous generation WIN.At the same time, the WIN 2 increases the TDP of 4.5W to 15W. When the temperature of the CPU is between 20 ℃~80 ℃, the 60-speed dynamic temperature control will be started by BIOS to optimally balance the energy/performance ratio.As for the design of the internal structure, it has benefited from changing the L-type motherboard, to a dual motherboard superposition design. The saved room is used to store the double battery stack, which effectively prevents the conduction of heat between the battery and motherboard.WIN 2 can be charged through mobile power based on PD 2.0 or PD 3.0. At the same time, WIN 2 can also provide the power for your mobile device, such as mobile phone. In theory, it can charge 6.8 times to iPhone 5, 5 times to iPhone 7, 3.6 times to iPhone X and 1.5 times to iPad Mini.

We were committed to build a portable device that can run a large number of retro games using emulators, and thus we launched the GPD XD. The XD was very successful and has been widely loved by PSP, NDS and arcade gamers.Later, we found that there were many games on the Windows platform, but there was no handheld console that could support these games. So we launched the GPD WIN. The introduction of this PC gaming handheld was a sensation both locally and abroad, though it is not perfect.The introduction of the WIN has laid the foundation for us to launch the WIN 2. The WIN 2 makes up for many deficiencies of our first product and has made a major breakthrough in terms of performance, heat dissipation, appearance, ergonomics and other aspects of the system.The reason why this crowdfunding was launched on Indiegogo, was mainly due to the high cost of: R&D, molds and materials. All the money we raise will go into volume production of this product. We believe that this product will thrill all players who love handheld gaming and it will be handheld PC gamer’s first choice for years to come. We sincerely hope that you can support this project. Let’s work together to make the GPD WIN 2 a reality.We are a company focused on handheld gaming products and office equipment based in Shenzhen, China. GPD is our brand, our full name is Gamepad Digital. GPD is committed to providing users with personalized products and services.To begin with, we thank all gamers who join in this crowdfunding campaign. It is your continuous support that makes our products better. Without your trust and support, there would be no mass production or market launch of this product.1. GPD WIN 2 game test videohttps://www.youtube.com/user/ThePhawx/videoshttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpnDsmgMnCn0XZvGIM9yrXg/videos2. Does the price includes tax tariffs for international buyer?The price includes international courier freight and surcharges to remote areas, but it does not include the import tax tariff generated when for the destination country. Generally, the tariff generated when reaching EU countries is 21% and about 10% to Japan. Parcels entering the United States with a value over $800, may also incur a tariff. The tariffs may be even higher to other countries.3. What after-sales service are crowdfunding participants entitled to?Crowdfunding participants have the same warranty rights as the product users who purchase the product after launch. If you are dissatisfied with the product, you can return it within one week of receipt of the goods, but the refund will deduct the shipping costs you initialy paid for the product.Please note that the postage and packaging charges incurred during the return of product will be your own responsibility. When mailing the product, the local postal delivery is preferred because other international logistics will generate tariff which is equal to 20% to 30% of the product value when entering China, GPD will not bear this the cost.4. What if the crowdfunding does not reach the target amount?If crowdfunding does not reach the target amount, Indiegogo shall refund all backers. At the same time, we will look for other financing channels to ensure the smooth development of R&D and production. We sincerely hope that all players who love this handheld can continue to follow the latest progress of the project.5. Dear Japanese backers, please note:Please write down your address in Japanese in order to avoid translation mistake causing failure delivery. Thank you.  お客様の住所は日本語で記入していただけませんか？ご協力ありがとうございます。6.

<p>Le Thymio II, conçu par l’École polytechnique fédéral de Lausanne, est un excellent choix pour mener des activités robotiques avec des élèves, particulièrement de primaire. Facile à utiliser, disposant de deux modes de programmation (visuel et textuel), il est très complet. Nous le conseillons avec beaucoup d’enthousiasme !<br/>
<b>Flowers Lab, INRIA, Bordeaux</b></p>
<p>For two years I have been developing learning materials and carrying out pedagogical research on the Thymio robot in collaboration with people from Mobsya. In my opinion, the Thymio robot and its Aseba software environment are the best systems for educational robotics. The robot is robust and inexpensive, yet equipped with more sensors than other, more expensive, educational robots. The software is based upon an advanced computer-science concept, yet the visual programming language is simple for young students to understand. I fully support this spin-fund request.<br/>

Thymio has many sensors, several actuators and various human-robot interface modalities. Wireless Thymio will have the same core capabilities, sensors and actuators. The difference is the new radio module and USB dongle that will make it programmable wirelessly.

<h4>Programming language and environment</h4>
<p>Thymio and Wireless Thymio can be programmed with Aseba. Aseba is a set of tools designed to give access to programming to the general public. It is an open-source software composed of VPL and Aseba Studio.</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top: 25px;"">FAQ</h2>
<h4>What age group is Thymio intended for?</h4>
<p>Thymio can be interesting for a very wide age range! Children as young as 5 can discover robotics through play, for example using the discovery kit with the help of an adult. Visual programming is great for beginners of all ages, although before 10 some children might not be comfortable with using a computer and mouse by themselves. Textual programming is accessible from teenagers to adults.</p>
<h4>Is Wireless Thymio compatible with Wi-fi or Bluetooth?</h4>
<p>No, Wireless Thymio is not compatible neither with Wi-fi, nor with Bluetooth. The wireless communication between the computer and Thymio is established through a radio frequency module inside the robot, and a dongle plugged into the USB socket of the computer. </p>
<h4>Do I need a USB dongle to program a Wireless Thymio?</h4>
<p>Yes, it is absolutely mandatory if you want to beneficiate of the Wireless capabilities. If you do not have a USB dongle plugged to your computer, you will not be able to connect to Wireless Thymio. Although, you will still be able to program Wireless Thymio with a USB cable. </p>
<h4>Do I need a classic Thymio to get a Wireless Thymio?</h4>
<p>No, you can directly buy a Wireless Thymio, it is the 150 EUR perk. You will then receive a new Wireless Thymio (already equipped with its module) and a USB dongle to plug into your computer.</p>
<h4>I have an old Thymio; can it be upgraded to Wireless Thymio?</h4>
<p><b>If your robot was bought after April 2012, yes.</b> You can buy the 70 EUR perk, send your robot to us, and we’ll upgrade it for you! If you are experienced with a soldering iron and like to do things yourself, you can also buy the 60 EUR perk, and you’ll get a kit to upgrade it yourself.<br/>
An easy way to know if your robot is upgradeable: look underneath, between the wheels, if “design by epfl / écal” is written.</p>

<h4>Can I upgrade my Thymio on my own?</h4>
<p>It is possible, but it is not simple. This procedure should be done only by people already familiar with electronics and experienced with a soldering iron. Indeed, you will have to open Thymio and solder the four pins of the module inside. Be careful, this procedure can damage the robot if it is not done properly.</p>
<h4>When will you ship the perks? </h4>
<p>Please be assured that you will receive your perks as soon as possible, at the latest in November. The development is already well advanced; the campaign aims primarily at financing the tooling, first batch, and certification. We already have experience in producing robots and we will keep you updated; you will not have unpleasant surprises!</p>
<h4>How does the upgrade happen?</h4>
<p>You send us you Thymio robot, we fix it, you get it back! You should send it to us before end of August 2015, and you’ll be sure to have it back in November! If you miss the deadline, no worries; we’ll upgrade it as soon as possible. We just cannot give you a precise date in that case!</p>
<h4>I forgot to add the shipping costs / made a mistake in the price. How can I fix this?</h4>
<p>It can happen, don´t worry! Before shipping the perks we will contact each contributor to verify their address and give them instructions on how to pay for the shipping if it has not been done already!</p>
<h4>My shipping address is not correct, can I change it?</h4>
<p>Yes, you can! Before shipping the perks, we will contact each contributor to verify their address.</p>

<p>For two years I have been developing learning materials and carrying out pedagogical research on the Thymio robot in collaboration with people from Mobsya. In my opinion, the Thymio robot and its Aseba software environment are the best systems for educational robotics. The robot is robust and inexpensive, yet equipped with more sensors than other, more expensive, educational robots. The software is based upon an advanced computer-science concept, yet the visual programming language is simple for young students to understand. I fully support this spin-fund request.<br/>

Thymio possède de nombreux capteurs, plusieurs actuateurs et différentes interfaces homme-robot. Le Wireless Thymio possédera les mêmes capacités de base, les mêmes capteurs et les mêmes actuateurs. La différence vient de son nouveau module radio permettant de le programmer sans fil.

<h4>Langage de programmation et environnement</h4>
<p>Thymio et Wireless Thymio peuvent être programmés grâce à Aseba. Aseba est un set d'outils conçus pour permettre l'accès à la programmation au grand public. C'est un logiciel open-source composé de VPL et d'Aseba Studio.</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top: 25px;"">FAQ</h2>
<h4>À quel âge peut-on utiliser Thymio ?</h4>
<p>Thymio peut être utilisé à tout âge ! Des enfants de 5 ans peuvent découvrir les robots en jouant avec ses modes de base ou en utilisant un poster découverte avec l'aide d'un adulte. La programmation visuelle est un excellent outil pour découvrir la programmation dès 6 ans, bien qu'avant 10 ans, certains enfants peuvent avoir besoin de l'aide d'un adulte pour utiliser l'ordinateur ou la souris. La programmation texte est accessible pour les jeunes, adolescents et adultes.</p>
<h4>Wireless Thymio est-il compatible avec le Wi-fi ou le Bluetooth ?</h4>
<p>Non, Wireless Thymio n'est ni compatible avec le Wi-fi, ni avec le Bluetooth. La communication sans fil entre un ordinateur et Wireless Thymio est établie grâce à un module radio dans le robot et à un dongle USB connecté à un ordinateur.</p>
<h4>Ai-je besoin d'un dongle USB pour programmer Wireless Thymio ?</h4>
<p>Oui, c'est absolument obligatoire si vous voulez profiter de la programmation sans fil. Si vous n'avez pas de dongle USB, votre ordinateur ne pourra pas se connecter à un Wireless Thymio. Malgré tout, vous pourrez toujours programmer un Wireless Thymio avec un câble USB. </p>
<h4>Ai-je besoin d'un Thymio classique pour avoir un Wireless Thymio ?</h4>
<p>Non, vous pouvez directement acheter un Wireless Thymio, il s'agit de la contrepartie à 150 EUR. Vous recevrez alors un nouveau Wireless Thymio (déjà équipé d'un module) et un dongle USB à brancher à votre ordinateur.</p>
<h4>J'ai un Thymio; peut-il être transformé en Wireless Thymio ?</h4>
<p><b>Si vous avez acheté votre robot après avril 2012, oui.</b> Vous pouvez acheter la contrepartie à 70 EUR, nous envoyer votre robot et nous le transformerons pour vous ! Si vous avez une bonne expérience avec un fer à souder et si vous voudriez le faire vous-même, vous pouvez acheter la contrepartie à 60 EUR, vous recevrez un kit pour le transformer vous-même.<br/>
Un moyen simple de savoir si votre robot peut être transformer est de regarder dessous, entre les roues. S'il y a une inscription ""design by epfl / écal"", alors c'est qu'il n'est PAS transformable.</p>

<h4>Puis-je transformer mon Thymio moi-même ?</h4>
<p>C'est possible mais ce n'est pas simple. Cette procédure ne doit être faite que si vous êtes familier avec l'électronique et si vous avez de l'expérience avec un fer à souder. Vous devrez ouvrir Thymio et souder les quatre pins du module radio à l'intérieur. Attention, cette procédure, si elle est mal réalisée, peut endommager votre robot.</p>
<h4>Quand mes contreparties seront-elles livrées ?</h4>
<p>Soyez assurés que vos contreparties seront envoyées dès que possible, au plus tard en novembre. Le développement est bien avancé, cette campagne de crowdfunding vise premièrement à financer la première production et la certification des robots. Nous avons déjà de l'expérience en production de robot à grande échelle et vous tiendrons au courant de l'évolution de la production. Vous n'aurez pas de mauvaises surprises !</p>
<h4>Comment la transformation de mon robot s'effectuera ?</h4>
<p>Vous nous envoyez votre Thymio, nous lui ajoutons le module et mettons un dongle USB dans sa boîte et vous le recevez en retour ! Vous devrez envoyer votre robot avant la fin du mois d'août 2015 pour être sûr de le recevoir en novembre ! Si vous rater cette échéance, pas de problème, votre robot sera transformé au plus vite ! Nous ne pourrons par contre pas vous garantir qu'il sera de retour pour novembre dans ce cas.</p>
<h4>J'ai oublié d'ajouter des frais d'envois / J'ai fait une erreur dans le prix. Comment puis-je arranger ça ?</h4>
<p>Cela peut arriver, pas de panique ! Avant de livrer vos contreparties, nous contacterons chaque contributeur par mail pour vérifier votre adresse et vous donner des instructions sur comment payer les frais d'envoi si ce n'est pas déjà fait!</p>
<h4>Mon adresse de livraison n'est pas correcte, puis-je la changer ?</h4>
<p>Oui, bien sûr ! Avant de livrer vos contreparties, nous vous contacterons tous individuellement pour vérifier votre adresse.</p>

In my opinion, the Thymio robot and its Aseba software environment are the best systems for educational robotics. The robot is robust and inexpensive, yet equipped with more sensors than other, more expensive, educational robots. The software is based upon an advanced computer-science concept, yet the visual programming language is simple for young students to understand. I fully support this spin-fund request.

Technical specifications


Thymio has many sensors, several actuators and various human-robot interface modalities. Wireless Thymio will have the same core capabilities, sensors and actuators. The difference is the new radio module and USB dongle that will make it programmable wirelessly.

Programming language and environment
Thymio and Wireless Thymio can be programmed with Aseba. Aseba is a set of tools designed to give access to programming to the general public. It is an open-source software composed of VPL and Aseba Studio.




VPL (for Visual Programming Language) has been designed especially to program Thymio in an easy way thanks to events and actions blocks. No text, just images.



 

Aseba Studio has been designed to program robots such as Thymio through text. It allows a deeper level of control and complexity than VPL.

FAQ
What age group is Thymio intended for?
Thymio can be interesting for a very wide age range! Children as young as 5 can discover robotics through play, for example using the discovery kit with the help of an adult. Visual programming is great for beginners of all ages, although before 10 some children might not be comfortable with using a computer and mouse by themselves. Textual programming is accessible from teenagers to adults.
Is Wireless Thymio compatible with Wi-fi or Bluetooth?
No, Wireless Thymio is not compatible neither with Wi-fi, nor with Bluetooth. The wireless communication between the computer and Thymio is established through a radio frequency module inside the robot, and a dongle plugged into the USB socket of the computer. 
Do I need a USB dongle to program a Wireless Thymio?
Yes, it is absolutely mandatory if you want to beneficiate of the Wireless capabilities. If you do not have a USB dongle plugged to your computer, you will not be able to connect to Wireless Thymio. Although, you will still be able to program Wireless Thymio with a USB cable. 
Do I need a classic Thymio to get a Wireless Thymio?
No, you can directly buy a Wireless Thymio, it is the 150 EUR perk. You will then receive a new Wireless Thymio (already equipped with its module) and a USB dongle to plug into your computer.
I have an old Thymio; can it be upgraded to Wireless Thymio?
If your robot was bought after April 2012, yes. You can buy the 70 EUR perk, send your robot to us, and we’ll upgrade it for you! If you are experienced with a soldering iron and like to do things yourself, you can also buy the 60 EUR perk, and you’ll get a kit to upgrade it yourself.
An easy way to know if your robot is upgradeable: look underneath, between the wheels, if “design by epfl / écal” is written.












Pre 2012 Thymio : NOT upgradeable
design epfl / écal / mobsya written between the wheels


Post-2012 Thymio : upgradeable
no inscription between the wheels




Can I upgrade my Thymio on my own?
It is possible, but it is not simple. This procedure should be done only by people already familiar with electronics and experienced with a soldering iron. Indeed, you will have to open Thymio and solder the four pins of the module inside. Be careful, this procedure can damage the robot if it is not done properly.
When will you ship the perks? 
Please be assured that you will receive your perks as soon as possible, at the latest in November. The development is already well advanced; the campaign aims primarily at financing the tooling, first batch, and certification. We already have experience in producing robots and we will keep you updated; you will not have unpleasant surprises!
How does the upgrade happen?
You send us you Thymio robot, we fix it, you get it back! You should send it to us before end of August 2015, and you’ll be sure to have it back in November! If you miss the deadline, no worries; we’ll upgrade it as soon as possible. We just cannot give you a precise date in that case!
I forgot to add the shipping costs / made a mistake in the price. How can I fix this?
It can happen, don´t worry! Before shipping the perks we will contact each contributor to verify their address and give them instructions on how to pay for the shipping if it has not been done already!
My shipping address is not correct, can I change it?
Yes, you can! Before shipping the perks, we will contact each contributor to verify their address.

FAQ
À quel âge peut-on utiliser Thymio ?
Thymio peut être utilisé à tout âge ! Des enfants de 5 ans peuvent découvrir les robots en jouant avec ses modes de base ou en utilisant un poster découverte avec l'aide d'un adulte. La programmation visuelle est un excellent outil pour découvrir la programmation dès 6 ans, bien qu'avant 10 ans, certains enfants peuvent avoir besoin de l'aide d'un adulte pour utiliser l'ordinateur ou la souris. La programmation texte est accessible pour les jeunes, adolescents et adultes.
Wireless Thymio est-il compatible avec le Wi-fi ou le Bluetooth ?
Non, Wireless Thymio n'est ni compatible avec le Wi-fi, ni avec le Bluetooth. La communication sans fil entre un ordinateur et Wireless Thymio est établie grâce à un module radio dans le robot et à un dongle USB connecté à un ordinateur.
Ai-je besoin d'un dongle USB pour programmer Wireless Thymio ?
Oui, c'est absolument obligatoire si vous voulez profiter de la programmation sans fil. Si vous n'avez pas de dongle USB, votre ordinateur ne pourra pas se connecter à un Wireless Thymio. Malgré tout, vous pourrez toujours programmer un Wireless Thymio avec un câble USB. 
Ai-je besoin d'un Thymio classique pour avoir un Wireless Thymio ?
Non, vous pouvez directement acheter un Wireless Thymio, il s'agit de la contrepartie à 150 EUR. Vous recevrez alors un nouveau Wireless Thymio (déjà équipé d'un module) et un dongle USB à brancher à votre ordinateur.
J'ai un Thymio; peut-il être transformé en Wireless Thymio ?
Si vous avez acheté votre robot après avril 2012, oui. Vous pouvez acheter la contrepartie à 70 EUR, nous envoyer votre robot et nous le transformerons pour vous ! Si vous avez une bonne expérience avec un fer à souder et si vous voudriez le faire vous-même, vous pouvez acheter la contrepartie à 60 EUR, vous recevrez un kit pour le transformer vous-même.
Un moyen simple de savoir si votre robot peut être transformer est de regarder dessous, entre les roues. S'il y a une inscription ""design by epfl / écal"", alors c'est qu'il n'est PAS transformable.












Thymio avant 2012 : PAS transformable
""design epfl / écal / mobsya"" écris entre les roues


Thymio après 2012 : transformable
Pas d'inscription entre les roues




Puis-je transformer mon Thymio moi-même ?
C'est possible mais ce n'est pas simple. Cette procédure ne doit être faite que si vous êtes familier avec l'électronique et si vous avez de l'expérience avec un fer à souder. Vous devrez ouvrir Thymio et souder les quatre pins du module radio à l'intérieur. Attention, cette procédure, si elle est mal réalisée, peut endommager votre robot.
Quand mes contreparties seront-elles livrées ?
Soyez assurés que vos contreparties seront envoyées dès que possible, au plus tard en novembre. Le développement est bien avancé, cette campagne de crowdfunding vise premièrement à financer la première production et la certification des robots. Nous avons déjà de l'expérience en production de robot à grande échelle et vous tiendrons au courant de l'évolution de la production. Vous n'aurez pas de mauvaises surprises !
Comment la transformation de mon robot s'effectuera ?
Vous nous envoyez votre Thymio, nous lui ajoutons le module et mettons un dongle USB dans sa boîte et vous le recevez en retour ! Vous devrez envoyer votre robot avant la fin du mois d'août 2015 pour être sûr de le recevoir en novembre ! Si vous rater cette échéance, pas de problème, votre robot sera transformé au plus vite ! Nous ne pourrons par contre pas vous garantir qu'il sera de retour pour novembre dans ce cas.
J'ai oublié d'ajouter des frais d'envois / J'ai fait une erreur dans le prix. Comment puis-je arranger ça ?
Cela peut arriver, pas de panique ! Avant de livrer vos contreparties, nous contacterons chaque contributeur par mail pour vérifier votre adresse et vous donner des instructions sur comment payer les frais d'envoi si ce n'est pas déjà fait!
Mon adresse de livraison n'est pas correcte, puis-je la changer ?
Oui, bien sûr ! Avant de livrer vos contreparties, nous vous contacterons tous individuellement pour vérifier votre adresse.

The products we create keep people safe at their jobs. Security guards, cops, and people who work in dangerous jobs can worry less because the vests we make protect them. I love my work.
I also love being a dad.  I have three kids. They are my favorite kids in the history of the universe. I love them more than this sentence could ever express. Watch them do their best in this video. I'm so very proud of them. 
I don't fear for my kids' safety every day, but I also cannot imagine what it would be like to lose them.  Thinking about such things is what drove me to make them some bulletproof backpack inserts. I made the panels from the same materials we use in our bulletproof vests.   
I can make the same bulletproof backpack panels for you too. It isn't too hard for me to do: I own BulletSafe, a bulletproof vest company. So we have all of the equipment and expertise. The panels are reasonably priced and high quality as well. I think you will like them.
When you contribute to the project I'll order the raw materials and have everything stitched up.  It takes a bit of labor, but I hope it will bring you the same peace of mind that protecting my children brings me.





What You Get & What You Give
Here is how this campaign works:

Your contribution of $89 funds the materials, costs and labor of making a backpack panel for you.
The price includes shipping to you anywhere in the US as well.
The panel is made from the same thickness and style of ballistic material as our BulletSafe Bulletproof Vest.
These panels protect really well.  They offer NIJ level IIIA Protection, which is the highest level of protection that soft armor offers. 
It will stop all handgun rounds up to and including a .44 Magnum which is an extremely powerful handgun. 
The panel is 10"" by 12"" in size, about the size of a magazine.  It weights 1 1/4 pounds.
It includes a tough, washable exterior cover, so it will survive one of the harshest environments in the world: a kid's backpack. 
This panel is perfect for protecting the world's most important people.
If you own a store, you can sign up too.  You'll receive a wholesale batch of panels as well as some materials to help you display them and sell them in your store.



Other Ways You Can HelpIf you don't have a need for a bulletproof backpack panel, but you like our project, perhaps you could tell someone about it?  We would be very grateful if you shared.Here is a Transcript of the VideoNot everyone understands kid-speak, so here is a transcript of video.
Kid #1: My Dad owns a bulletproof vest company and he made me this.  It keeps me safe.  It's made from the same stuff as the bulletproof vest, BulletSafe.
Kid #2: It isn't heavy and it is also strong so that I can put this and other stuff in my backpack.
Kid #3: The outside is washable in case I spill something on it.
Gorgeous Woman: In our family, we protect what is most valuable.
Guy: That's right, I'm Tom and I run BulletSafe a bulletproof vest company.  I made these panels for my kids to keep them safe too. I can do the same for you.  If you fund this campaign, my company will send you this panel.  It is 10"" by 12"", reliable, washable and durable. umm. If you want to protect what is most precious to you, I think it is a great choice.  

Thank YouSincerely, 
Tom  Nardone, President - BulletSafe Bulletproof Vests.

<p>Globus has created a Virtual Private Network (VPN) browser <span>built on the Chromium base. The browser is specifically designed to escape
from service providers' restrictions.  As technology
progresses, privacy and security become an escalating
issues, Globus Browser is the solution to these concerns.</span></p>
<p><span>Globus
is
the answer for the growing international demand for secure applications.  Our product is far easier, more
reliable and convenient to use than any other
solution available today. Globus Browser is an “Out of the Box” product with no
limitations by default, which
is simple and secure unlike most of the other available VPN solutions.</span></p>
<p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
<p><span>With
the help of the VPN agent, all traffic
is automatically redirected through Globus owned
servers in England, Germany, US, Russia and other countries. Every user can
choose the preferred location of the server through which the traffic will be
redirected at any time with a click of a mouse<del>.</del>…
It’s just that simple!</span></p>

meaning even the most sophisticated machine will require more than one million years to hack the key. By following

<br/>
<p></p>
<p>For those <span>unaware
or unfamiliar with
VPN or Tor, we will explain what these are and how they
enable the
highest level of privacy and security.</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Brief Introduction of
VPN…  </span></u></b></p>
<p>Every Internet
user<strike> </strike>will realize that
all his or her actions on the Internet are
written by his Internet Service Provider (ISP) or may be intercepted by third
parties and that his personal IP address can be equated to his passport number.</p>
<p>This is how an ordinary Internet connection looks like. All Internet
traffic is not encrypted. The destination node sees your real IP address.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1112462/files/20141222140515-1.png?1419285915"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>And this is how a VPN Internet connection looks like. All Internet
traffic is encrypted. The destination node sees VPN server's IP address.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1112464/files/20141222140557-1_.png?1419285957"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Have you ever thought about the fact that absolutely all of your actions
on the Internet can be tracked and used against your will? After all, ISP's
usually collect all this data as they are bound to store it for quite a long
time.</p>
<p>Globus VPN technology creates a secure tunnel between your PC and one of
the VPN servers. The tunnel encrypts all user<span><del>'</del>s’
Internet traffic (including all applications' traffic) and hides user’s
IP address by replacing it with the IP address of the VPN server. VPN service
will become a supporting tool for those who care about safety
and anonymity and those who don't want to share their personal data with their
ISP's and those websites they visit.</span></p>

<h4>Benefits of Globus VPN Secure Privacy Browser and TOR</h4>
<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Unblock websites - Unblock YouTube, unblock Facebook, unblock Twitter, sites at school, the library, gaming sites or your office with Globus Secure Privacy Browser from anywhere. You can bypass filters and firewalls set by your network administrator to gain access to your favorite content.</li>
<li>Anonymous surfing - Because of privacy and security concerns, you may want to browse the Web anonymously. Globus Secure Privacy Browser creates an encrypted tunnel between your computer and our servers to let you conduct your online activities (visit the websites you want, make online transactions, download files) anonymously, without being tracked and spied upon.</li>
<li>Hide your IP address - The Internet is infested with spammers, snoopers, and hackers. They silently monitor your online activities and steal your sensitive data like credit card information and passwords when you least expect it. If you connect with Globus Secure Privacy Browser VPN enabled, you get a new US IP address to mask your actual IP address and surf the Internet anonymously.</li>
<li>Private &amp; secure browsing - VPN offers an enhanced level of security online. Whenever you connect to the Internet through Globus Secure Privacy Browser and VPN, your data, including passwords, financial transactions and instant messages, is secured and encrypted. Additionally, your personal information is hidden from web spies.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi security - If you browse the Internet at a public Wi-Fi hotspot like the Starbucks in your town, anyone on that network can monitor and spy on your web activities. Irrespective of where you connect from, a personal VPN secures your web browsing session and keeps your private data considerably more private.</li>
<li>Malware protection - Globus Secure Privacy Browser VPN and TOR will alert you if you visit sites that are known to contain malware, and then block the site. It detects and blocks more than 3.5 million malicious, phishing and spam sites from infecting your device.</li>

<p><b>Brief Introduction of Tor…</b><br/></p>
<p>Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to
improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software
developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.
Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow
organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without
compromising their privacy.</p>
<p>Using Tor protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance
known as ""traffic analysis."" Traffic analysis can be used to infer
who is talking to whom over a public network. Knowing the source and
destination of your Internet traffic allows others to track your behavior and
interests.</p>
<p>How does traffic analysis work? Internet data packets have two parts: a
data payload and a header used for routing. The data payload is whatever is
being sent, whether that's an email message, a web page, or an audio file.</p>
<p>A basic problem for the privacy minded is that the recipient of your
communications can see that you sent it by looking at headers. So can
authorized intermediaries like Internet service providers, and sometimes
unauthorized intermediaries as well. A very simple form of traffic analysis
might involve sitting somewhere between sender and recipient on the network,
looking at headers.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once a circuit has been established, many kinds of data can be exchanged
and several different sorts of software applications can be deployed over the
Tor network. Because each relay sees no more than one hop in the circuit,
neither an eavesdropper nor a compromised relay can use traffic analysis to
link the connection's source and destination. Tor only works for TCP streams
and can be used by any application with SOCKS support.</p>
<p>For efficiency, the Tor software uses the same circuit for connections that
happen within the same ten minutes or so. Later requests are given a new
circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new ones.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Globus VPN + TOR…</b></p>
<p>This is a perfect security solution when users can route Tor through VPN
services which will prevent your ISP from seeing that you're using Tor. On one
hand, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won't stand out as much<span>,
but on the other hand, in some countries replacing an encrypted Tor connection
with an encrypted VPN connection, would be suspicious as well but not with
Globus VPN where one can select a specific server in a specific country of your
choice. This is a win, win!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine's
default Internet connection, and TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) (or Tor client) will
route through it.</p>
<p>Another advantage here is that this prevents Tor from seeing who you are
behind the Globus VPN. So if somebody somehow does manage to break Tor and
learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN was actually
following through on their premises (they won't watch, they won't remember, and
they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then
you'll be better off. But this will not happen. </p>

<p><b>PRIVACY LEAKAGES
THAT GLOBUS PREVENTS</b></p>
<h3><b>Block Ads</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Globus Secure Privacy Browser blocks all annoying ads on the web by default: video ads for example on YouTube, Facebook ads, flashy banners, pop-ups, pop-unders and much more. It does this based on the filter lists you've chosen.</p>
<h3><b>Acceptable Ads</b></h3>
<p>Many websites rely on advertising revenues, so instead of blocking all ads, we decided to try and encourage websites to use non-intrusive advertising instead of annoying ads people are most like to ignore and want to block.</p>
<h3><b>Disable Tracking</b></h3>
<p>With every browsing session, there are multiple firms tracking your online activity and browsing history. There are hundreds of ad agencies tracking your every move, but with Globus Secure Privacy Browser you can easily disable most tracking, and browse the web more anonymously.</p>
<h3><b>Disable Malware Domains</b></h3>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Slow startup, popups, advertisers hijacking our browser: Those are all signs of your computer being infected by malware. Even worse, computers infected by malware open the doors to all kinds of cyber criminality threats. These infected computers can then be used to sending out spam emails or attacking other computers or servers, stealing passwords, social security numbers, personal documents and credit card information.</p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Globus Secure Privacy Browser can be configured to block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spy- and adware.</p>
<h3>Disable Social Media Buttons</h3>
<p>Buttons to share content on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and many others are placed on almost every website you visit. Even if you are not clicking them, every website containing these buttons is sending a request to the servers of the social network which can use that information to create a profile based on your browsing habits.</p>
<p>You can use Globus Privacy Browser to remove social media buttons from every website, making sure that social networks can’t create a profile about you based on the websites you visit.</p>

<h2><b>FAQ</b></h2>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Whether the result of the company on Indiegogo on a release of the updated version of the browser depends?</b></p>
<p>Doesn't depend at all as we work on the browser already long time and already we test the updated version which it is visible on the screenshots. After the termination of the company on Indiegogo VPN and TOR service will become paid. We simply in fact offer our service for the most reasonable prices in all the Internet if at us it turns out we we will direct all money for further development of the project.<b> </b>All security settings will be always free!!!</p>
</div>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>How does your VPN browser work?</b></p>
<p>Once
you go online using our browser the internet connection is established between
your internet service provider and our internet service provider. Everything
you do online is 'encrypted' and essentially anonymous; anyone trying to break
into your internet connection to steal your data (e.g. on public Wifi networks)
will not be able to because your web traffic is securely hidden. Websites you
visit, usernames and passwords used to login to websites, people you talk to
online, and files you download and share will be out of sight by third-parties
trying to monitor your online usage and potentially steal sensitive information
from you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Will</b><b>
my traffic be securely hidden?</b></p>
<p>Not
only is your online traffic anonymized, your online identity in the form of an
'IP address' is also hidden. Your IP address is essentially your 'online
fingerprint' and identification to the rest of the online world. Your IP
address can tell people and websites your physical location and which internet
service provider you are using. You wouldn't show your identity to a random
person in the street, so why would you reveal your online identity and location
to potentially millions of online strangers?</p>
<p>Our VPN browser is very easy to use, while VPN encryption may sound complicated
to some people, you do not need technical knowledge to anonymize your online
traffic and protect your online identity. All you need to do is install our browser
and use it same as you would use Internet Explorer or Chrome. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>What is the difference between a web proxy and a
VPN browser?</b></p>
<p>A
VPN browser will automatically anonymously encrypt your entire internet
connection and as such all applications on your computer will be secured,
whereas with a web proxy you will need to configure certain applications
manually (such as your web browser). Globus Browser uses much stronger
encryption methods and is therefore considered extremely secure comparing to
web proxies.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Will a VPN browser be slower than any other
browser?</b></p>
<p>There
are a number of factors that will determine the speed you get with a VPN browser.
The most obvious factor is your internet speed to begin with, and the distance
between your physical location and the location of our VPN server nodes. The
closer you are to our VPN server locations, there is less chance you'll
experience speed loss. </p>
<p>·  <b>Can it be used on Mac as well as Windows?</b><br/></p>
<p>Globus Browser can be used on any of the operating systems – Windows, Mac, Linux. There are no restrictions to the operating systems you want to run it on.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>What will my ISP see when I'm connected to your
VPN?</b></p>
<p>Your
ISP will only see a secured encrypted connection to one of our remote VPN
servers. They won't be able to recognise your online activities and make sense
of your internet traffic.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span><b>Will</b><b>
I need to register once Globus Browser is installed?</b></p>
<p>No, absolutely
not. We will not ask any of your personal details at any stage. Once the VPN
Browser is installed you will be able to use it instantly without any
registration whatsoever. </p>

</div></div>","So why Globus Browser? At the moment Globus VPN+TOR is totally free! For All devices!  Now the beta version of the new browser is available! See details about operation of the new browser in one of the videos below.
 



Globus Browser – First Ever VPN+TOR Privacy Browser. Full anonymity and
security at the highest level. 


Globus has created a Virtual Private Network (VPN) browser built on the Chromium base. The browser is specifically designed to escape
from service providers' restrictions.  As technology
progresses, privacy and security become an escalating
issues, Globus Browser is the solution to these concerns.
Globus
is
the answer for the growing international demand for secure applications.  Our product is far easier, more
reliable and convenient to use than any other
solution available today. Globus Browser is an “Out of the Box” product with no
limitations by default, which
is simple and secure unlike most of the other available VPN solutions.
How does it work?
With
the help of the VPN agent, all traffic
is automatically redirected through Globus owned
servers in England, Germany, US, Russia and other countries. Every user can
choose the preferred location of the server through which the traffic will be
redirected at any time with a click of a mouse.…
It’s just that simple!





                              

Globus uses the encryption key of 1028-bit to 2048-bit,
meaning even the most sophisticated machine will require more than one million years to hack the key. By following
available protocols as IPSEC VPN (universal and very fast) and OpenVPN (steady
and extremely secure) it guarantees
that this encryption type
will indisputably protect your private information with ease.
Further more Globus has managed to embrace the VPN and Tor together for
even higher
level of privacy and security. Globus Servers+TOR allows you to visit the sites closed for the usual Internet browsing.
 

                                   


For those unaware
or unfamiliar with
VPN or Tor, we will explain what these are and how they
enable the
highest level of privacy and security.
Brief Introduction of
VPN…  
Every Internet
user will realize that
all his or her actions on the Internet are
written by his Internet Service Provider (ISP) or may be intercepted by third
parties and that his personal IP address can be equated to his passport number.
This is how an ordinary Internet connection looks like. All Internet
traffic is not encrypted. The destination node sees your real IP address.







And this is how a VPN Internet connection looks like. All Internet
traffic is encrypted. The destination node sees VPN server's IP address.







Have you ever thought about the fact that absolutely all of your actions
on the Internet can be tracked and used against your will? After all, ISP's
usually collect all this data as they are bound to store it for quite a long
time.
Globus VPN technology creates a secure tunnel between your PC and one of
the VPN servers. The tunnel encrypts all user's’
Internet traffic (including all applications' traffic) and hides user’s
IP address by replacing it with the IP address of the VPN server. VPN service
will become a supporting tool for those who care about safety
and anonymity and those who don't want to share their personal data with their
ISP's and those websites they visit.


Benefits of Globus VPN Secure Privacy Browser and TOR



Unblock websites - Unblock YouTube, unblock Facebook, unblock Twitter, sites at school, the library, gaming sites or your office with Globus Secure Privacy Browser from anywhere. You can bypass filters and firewalls set by your network administrator to gain access to your favorite content.
Anonymous surfing - Because of privacy and security concerns, you may want to browse the Web anonymously. Globus Secure Privacy Browser creates an encrypted tunnel between your computer and our servers to let you conduct your online activities (visit the websites you want, make online transactions, download files) anonymously, without being tracked and spied upon.
Hide your IP address - The Internet is infested with spammers, snoopers, and hackers. They silently monitor your online activities and steal your sensitive data like credit card information and passwords when you least expect it. If you connect with Globus Secure Privacy Browser VPN enabled, you get a new US IP address to mask your actual IP address and surf the Internet anonymously.
Private & secure browsing - VPN offers an enhanced level of security online. Whenever you connect to the Internet through Globus Secure Privacy Browser and VPN, your data, including passwords, financial transactions and instant messages, is secured and encrypted. Additionally, your personal information is hidden from web spies.
Wi-Fi security - If you browse the Internet at a public Wi-Fi hotspot like the Starbucks in your town, anyone on that network can monitor and spy on your web activities. Irrespective of where you connect from, a personal VPN secures your web browsing session and keeps your private data considerably more private.
Malware protection - Globus Secure Privacy Browser VPN and TOR will alert you if you visit sites that are known to contain malware, and then block the site. It detects and blocks more than 3.5 million malicious, phishing and spam sites from infecting your device.

Having made a server choice from TOR You will have an opportunity to visit all available TOR networks so that your provider will never find out about using TOR networks by You. (these networks will not be available unless you have chosen the server from TOR)





Brief Introduction of Tor…
Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows people and groups to
improve their privacy and security on the Internet. It also enables software
developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features.
Tor provides the foundation for a range of applications that allow
organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without
compromising their privacy.
Using Tor protects you against a common form of Internet surveillance
known as ""traffic analysis."" Traffic analysis can be used to infer
who is talking to whom over a public network. Knowing the source and
destination of your Internet traffic allows others to track your behavior and
interests.
How does traffic analysis work? Internet data packets have two parts: a
data payload and a header used for routing. The data payload is whatever is
being sent, whether that's an email message, a web page, or an audio file.
A basic problem for the privacy minded is that the recipient of your
communications can see that you sent it by looking at headers. So can
authorized intermediaries like Internet service providers, and sometimes
unauthorized intermediaries as well. A very simple form of traffic analysis
might involve sitting somewhere between sender and recipient on the network,
looking at headers.






Once a circuit has been established, many kinds of data can be exchanged
and several different sorts of software applications can be deployed over the
Tor network. Because each relay sees no more than one hop in the circuit,
neither an eavesdropper nor a compromised relay can use traffic analysis to
link the connection's source and destination. Tor only works for TCP streams
and can be used by any application with SOCKS support.
For efficiency, the Tor software uses the same circuit for connections that
happen within the same ten minutes or so. Later requests are given a new
circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new ones.








Globus VPN + TOR…
This is a perfect security solution when users can route Tor through VPN
services which will prevent your ISP from seeing that you're using Tor. On one
hand, VPNs are more popular than Tor, so you won't stand out as much,
but on the other hand, in some countries replacing an encrypted Tor connection
with an encrypted VPN connection, would be suspicious as well but not with
Globus VPN where one can select a specific server in a specific country of your
choice. This is a win, win!

Once the VPN client has connected, the VPN tunnel will be the machine's
default Internet connection, and TBB (Tor Browser Bundle) (or Tor client) will
route through it.
Another advantage here is that this prevents Tor from seeing who you are
behind the Globus VPN. So if somebody somehow does manage to break Tor and
learn the IP address your traffic is coming from, but your VPN was actually
following through on their premises (they won't watch, they won't remember, and
they will somehow magically make it so nobody else is watching either), then
you'll be better off. But this will not happen. 

Mobile Friendly !
Globus Browser also comes as a Mobile Application which supports all browsers for Android, Apple and other smartphones and tablets devices. Also with the help of our users and supporters we are planning to develop a full version of Globus Browser for smartphones and Tablets.  

            




Do You know that visiting the top 50 websites will install over 3,000 tracking files on your computer!?

Over 80% of websites use one or more tracking tools but with your help
we can provide a solution. This fact prompted us
to dig deeper for a solution to keep our computers safe and private!

What will be done with the funds?
 Please see our short video where we explain what we plan to do with the funds we raise.





PRIVACY LEAKAGES
THAT GLOBUS PREVENTS
Block Ads

Globus Secure Privacy Browser blocks all annoying ads on the web by default: video ads for example on YouTube, Facebook ads, flashy banners, pop-ups, pop-unders and much more. It does this based on the filter lists you've chosen.
Acceptable Ads
Many websites rely on advertising revenues, so instead of blocking all ads, we decided to try and encourage websites to use non-intrusive advertising instead of annoying ads people are most like to ignore and want to block.
Disable Tracking
With every browsing session, there are multiple firms tracking your online activity and browsing history. There are hundreds of ad agencies tracking your every move, but with Globus Secure Privacy Browser you can easily disable most tracking, and browse the web more anonymously.
Disable Malware Domains
Slow startup, popups, advertisers hijacking our browser: Those are all signs of your computer being infected by malware. Even worse, computers infected by malware open the doors to all kinds of cyber criminality threats. These infected computers can then be used to sending out spam emails or attacking other computers or servers, stealing passwords, social security numbers, personal documents and credit card information.
Globus Secure Privacy Browser can be configured to block domains known to spread malware, protecting your computer against viruses, Trojan horses, worms, spy- and adware.
Disable Social Media Buttons
Buttons to share content on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and many others are placed on almost every website you visit. Even if you are not clicking them, every website containing these buttons is sending a request to the servers of the social network which can use that information to create a profile based on your browsing habits.
You can use Globus Privacy Browser to remove social media buttons from every website, making sure that social networks can’t create a profile about you based on the websites you visit.

COMPREHENSIVE
AD & TRACKER BLOCKING




Globus includes a built-in protection
against thousands of Tracking Scripts, Tracking Cookies & Other Tracking
Agents, Ad Networks and Third-Party Widgets.
Services such as address bar autofill
are done locally in your system so your browsing never goes through our
servers.
NO Data Collection. Unlike other
tracker blockers & privacy tools, Globus NEVER collects, shares or sells
any data from our users!

SEARCH
PROTECTION




All your searches are private in
Globus. 
When you visit any of the world’s leading search engines in Globus, your
searches are automatically directed via  vpn to prevent search engines from
saving your searches by your IP address.

REFERER HEADER
DATA NOT SENT




Unlike other browsers, Globus does
not send data about search terms you’ve entered to other 
websites when you click on links from a search engine.

DO NOT TRACK
SIGNAL ALWAYS - ON




We demand every website you go to not
to track you. 
And don’t worry, we also vigorously block them from tracking you!

LOCAL ADDRESS
BAR AUTO-COMPLETE




Globus auto-completes URL’s as you
type them in its address bar via a database stored locally on your computer.
Other browsers send what you type in the address bar to their servers to get
suggestions which means that they know every search you make and site you visit
which can violate your privacy

New Browser extensions 


All settings shown in the video below have been tested and are fully functional.  Beta version browser is available for downloading from our new site: https://privacybrowser.org



New Version of the Browser Includes:

1. New site (screenshot below)

2. Status display of the VPN
connection
3. Selected Server display (flag)
4. Control of the status of the VPN connection
5. Manage security settings + block
tracking
6. Selection of VPN servers
New VPN controls will be presented in
the form of 2 advanced controls and 2 extensions for display. Management of security
settings and track blocking will be done from a separate extension. In order to
display the current status of the VPN two indicator settings are provided: the current
status of the VPN connection and an indicator of the selected server.


All security settings will always remain free of charge!!!
This version of the browser will provide the user with
enhanced security features. The user will be able to control these features,
most of which will be concentrated in the settings menu.
•Acceptable Ads
•Disable Tracking
•Disable Malware Domains
•Disable Social Media Buttons


• Disable preloading pages
• Disabling alternative pages with error messages
• Turning off auto-complete options
• Disabling the password saving features
• Disable the transmission of information about the
visited websites
• Disable spell check
• Disabling of Google Translate
• Ban on usage of third-party cookies
• Blocking elements on pages that request user data as
well as advertising banners
• Prohibition of ""most visited websites""
• Transmitting the signal ""Do not track""
• Removing user data on browser closure


To control the security settings the user will be able to
utilize a separate extension. Two optional settings will be available for the
user: manual and automatic. When using the manual settings the user, by the
means of checkboxes sets the required security options. The automatic version
is presented as a slider with several provisions. Each status is a set of pre-configured
settings corresponding to a certain level of security


The message in the bottom right corner is showing how many tracks (bugs) has been blocked on every calling to the different websites!

All settings can be set manually to fit user requirements!

The browser won’t accept third-party cookies and blocks trackers as well as ads, which often include trackers. The average Web page contains six trackers with some having up to 40. A side benefit of blocking them is faster download speeds from some sites because without ads and trackers less information is downloaded to build pages, 

Globus Secure Privacy Browser blocks referer data sent to search engines to prevent those engines from gathering and selling the data to advertisers.
Globus Browser has all Google tracking and Web services are removed. Those services include auto-translate, address bar suggest, spell-check, URL check, malware check and home sync.
None of a users’ browsing traffic passes through Hidden Reflex servers so it has no record of where users have browsed to. Services such as address bar auto-fill are handled locally.

Why Privacy is Important:
From the perspective of hundreds of ad & data collection companies, you are the product, waiting to be sold to advertisers.


“You know that dream where you suddenly realize you’re stark naked? You’re living it whenever you open your browser.”The New York Times

Online Advertising is a $50 billion business.
Your age, race, sex, weight, height, marital status, education level, politics, buying habits, household wealth, health issues, vacation dreams, search queries and other personal details are collected and sold by data aggregators millions of times every second on ad exchanges.


“Data collected through your browsing can determine whether you can obtain a job, credit or insurance.”
The New York Times


“Your information can be stored, analyzed, indexed and sold as a commodity to data brokers who in turn might sell it to advertisers, employers, health insurers or credit rating agencies .”The New York Times
There are dozens of data collection firms. The industry leader alone processes 50 trillion data “transactions” a year yielding revenues of over $1 billion. All from selling Your Data.



Online Data is Merged with Offline Data and Sold.
""Personally identifiable data from the online world is merged with personally identifiable information from the offline world, everyday,"" says the head of global privacy and public policy at Acxiom, a leading data collection firm to The New York Times.

These companies have big plans for your data. The world's leading search engine's former CEO:
“We know where you are. We know where you’ve been. We can more or less know what you’re thinking about.”

""Websites Vary Prices, Deals Based on Users' Information...A Wall Street Journal investigation identified several companies including Staples...and Home Depot, that were consistently adjusting prices.”

You would never let anyone stalk you in real life.
Imagine hundred s of people following you around your work, your home, at stores with a notebook, writing down everything you do!! That’s what happens every time you browse the internet in an ordinary browser.

<p><b>This is not our first rodeo...  </b></p>
<p>We've been manufacturing bags for over 4 years so we are well aware of the challenges ahead and know what to expect. We have an established supply chain and between us a wealth of experience in product development, project management, logistics and after sales service. We have confidence in our timelines and we will do everything in our power to make sure we get your rewards on time.<br/> </p>

<p><b>How It All Started  </b></p>
<p>We’ve seen a massive shift in recent years with more and more people working remotely and spending less time in a conventional office setting. This growing trend is showing no signs of slowing down, so we decided to hop on board and create a product that can help people work more efficiently and effectively on the go. Four years worth of research and designing later, and we’ve created something we’re really excited about - the world’s first truly ergonomic laptop bag for everyday carry.</p>

In the crowdfunding community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as “rewards” because they are not purchases in the traditional sense. They are gifts – in our case, work bags – that are sent to our supporters as a token of appreciation for their support of our business. In the same way that public television funds their service through the pledges of their supporters, who in turn receive gifts and continued programming, we have chosen to run and grow our business on a crowdfunded business model.<br/><br/>We appreciate your understanding of our policy and the support you have given us.

Tooling and Production is already complete







This is not our first rodeo...  
We've been manufacturing bags for over 4 years so we are well aware of the challenges ahead and know what to expect. We have an established supply chain and between us a wealth of experience in product development, project management, logistics and after sales service. We have confidence in our timelines and we will do everything in our power to make sure we get your rewards on time. 

 
How It All Started  
We’ve seen a massive shift in recent years with more and more people working remotely and spending less time in a conventional office setting. This growing trend is showing no signs of slowing down, so we decided to hop on board and create a product that can help people work more efficiently and effectively on the go. Four years worth of research and designing later, and we’ve created something we’re really excited about - the world’s first truly ergonomic laptop bag for everyday carry.

 

 
    Manufacturer's WarrantyAll Rovingwork products come with a full manufacturer’s warranty that covers manufacturing defects or faults for a period of 12 months from the date of original purchase, when the product is purchased from Rovingwork or through an authorised reseller.Warranty does not cover wear and tear and does not apply to damage caused by accident, abuse, misuse, or modification of the Product.If a problem occurs with your product within its warranty period, please send an email to support@rovingwork.com.au with a description and photo of the fault along with a copy of your proof of purchase. Please allow 3-5 business days for us to respond to your enquiry.Your item will be assessed and if covered by warranty, the fault will be repaired and the item returned to you free of charge. In the case that no repair is possible, the item will be replaced or refunded.If we determine that your return is not covered by warranty then any costs associated with returning your item to you will be your responsibility. Return PolicyWhile all of our products are covered by a 12 month Manufacturer's Warranty, it is not our policy to offer refunds or returns on items received as Indiegogo rewards.The support we get from our Indiegogo backers is what enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products and improve existing ones. In the crowdfunding community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as “rewards” because they are not purchases in the traditional sense. They are gifts – in our case, work bags – that are sent to our supporters as a token of appreciation for their support of our business. In the same way that public television funds their service through the pledges of their supporters, who in turn receive gifts and continued programming, we have chosen to run and grow our business on a crowdfunded business model.We appreciate your understanding of our policy and the support you have given us. If your reward truly offers no value to you, here are a few things that you could do in the spirit of crowdfunding… 1.

<h2>This campaign is has been revised as of 2/18/13. </h2>
<h3>The goal amount necorrectly correct. The message below will mention the correct amount needed. </h3>
<p>Hi my names Rob. I am a first year college my local community college.  I am one of three kids that are currently in school.  So money is tight in my family.  My parents a currently divorced and my dad doesnt pitch in that much money for me and my siblings.  And my mom is at a job where she doesnt make that much money to support all of us all the time.  My dad pays her money for child support but that is over in a few months when my younger sister turns 18.</p>
<p>My campain is currently to raise money so i can go buy a laptop for my mom.  She uses the computer alot for her job but isnt able to bring it home because she uses the company's computer on site.  So my goal is to buy her one so she is able to bring that to her job and use that so she is able to bring it home and work at home.  </p>
<p>Contributing anything to my campaign will mean alot to not only to me but to my mom.  And anyone who does contribute will recieve a personal thank you from the two of us.  She will be able to get more done at work and make her job that much easier.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As of right now i need $200 to buy her the 13"" macbook air which is $1199 without tax.  I have been putting whatever money i have gotten in the past few months into this fund for my mom. I didnt ask alot for christmas and my birthday was a few weeks ago and the money i recieved from relatives has been put into this.  indiegogo wperp let me set minimum of $200 and I do not need $750.  If in the time I have set for this campain that i dont recive the $200 i will use that money to buy her a different laptop that i can afford to buy her.  And if my goal is reached in this time and more is made i will give whatever amount that is to my mom.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Having this campain goal realized will mean that my mom will be abe to get more done at her job.  She is limited to what she can do while she is working in the office without having a computer of her own. Getting more work done at her job will show her bosses that she is worth having around and could some day get a raise.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you read this and know you cant contribute to my campain thats okay.  But if you know anyone that is able to let them know of my campain.  Every penny will be appreciated.</p>

<p><img alt=""San Francisco's July 4th protest"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/yMW9rtP.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But we always knew one day's protests wouldn't be enough. We've completed a very necessary Step One, and now it's on to Step Two.</p>
<h3>How you will be helping us restore the fourth</h3>
<p>We managed (miraculously in our opinion) to launch these protests entirely with volunteer help and with no financial assistance of any kind on the national level, aside from a few hundred dollars for social media ads that ran the day before and day of the protest. But we received so many unsolicited requests for information on how to donate that we were forced to think of how we could use these resources to help protect the 4th amendment, and we determined that was by taking this movement to the next level.</p>
<p>We seek to raise $10 000 with which to purchase the tools to create a long-term Restore the Fourth national organization to keep the fight going well passed the 4th of July. Where we have focused on advocacy this past week, we will turn much of our focus on taking the fight to the nation's courthouses and legislatures and other channels of lawful influence, with the intention of keeing it going until the 4th amendment is once again being respected by the US government.</p>
<p>We will convene this upcoming week (July 8th - 12th) with the leaders of our most successful and active local organizations to lay out a structure for a permanent organization dedicated to defending the 4th Amendment against unwarranted search of all kinds.</p>
<h3>Some of the projects on our radar...</h3>
<p>- Maintaining the significant <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/nV0DI4h.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">media attention we brought towards the issue of unconstitutional surveillance</a> by continuing to engage with the press and with users on social media about our ongoing and future projects.</p>
<p>- Planning, coordinating, and promoting future nationwide protests.</p>
<p>- Planning, coordinating, and promoting a massive one-city protest in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>- Phone call, petitioning, and letter-writing campaigns directed towards both Congress and state governments.</p>
<p>- Exploring more local spheres of influence such as town hall meetings.</p>
<p>- Political lobbying in defense of the 4th Amendment.</p>
<p>- Legal action in defense of the 4th Amendment.</p>
<h3>Some examples of expenses we will incur...</h3>
<p>- Paying for various basic tools required to operate, such as a P.O. box and dedicated press phone number.</p>
<p>- Website hosting and maintenence fees. On peak days our website traffic has reached levels worth $27 in server bandwidth fees, or a rate of $800 per month.</p>
<p>- Fees for legally registering our organization. Options we are considering include becoming a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">501c3 or 501c4</a> non-profit.</p>
<p>- Accounting and legal help. While we do this with free tools or seek pro bono assistance to the extent that it's possible, we may need a modest level of paid help in these areas.</p>
<p>- Strategic, geographically-targeted online advertisements that increase attendance at protests and bring attention to the issue of unconstitutional surveillance.</p>
<p>- Local organizers of protests incur various fees including for permits and flyers/signs. While they currently do their own fundraising or pay out of pocket, we would like to provide assistance in the future when necessary and worthwhile.</p>
<h3>""That sounds nice but there's a lot of good things to donate to. Why Restore the Fourth?""</h3>
<p>- Restore the Fourth is run entirely by volunteers, and we expect to keep it that way for a long time, if not forever. None of your money will be going towards salaries, let alone six or seven figure salaries.</p>
<p>- Because we successfully ran an essentially-unfunded campaign, we know how to operate inexpensively, including how to find free or heavily discounted versions of many tools. That's why we only need $10 000 to launch. None of your money is going towards unnecessary extravagance. All of it is going towards the most useful things we could buy per dollar.<br/><br/>- Protest movements are known for being ""co-opted"" by partisans and special interest groups, especially when those partisans and special interest groups are the ones providing the cash. Successful community-centric fundraising like this will allow Restore the Fourth to remain independent and non-partisan while also enjoying the benefits of a legally registered organization with some cashflow.</p>
<h3>""Who <em>are</em> you?""</h3>
<p>Restore the Fourth's national organization is currently run by a board of six individuals from across North America that assist, coordinate, and promote our various local chapters. We are currently working on an ""About Us"" page and on expanding the board to include more of our most active and well-run local organizers on an official basis.</p>
<p>Currently our finances have been entrused with Andrea O'Neill, our representitive from the Washington chapter, while we wait to open a merchant account and to incorporate.

time has come to change the way people currently make used item deals within
classic “peer-to-peer” online market places. There is a real need to break some
barriers that are associated with the usual practice in this sector: lack of
trust, usability
frustration, various hidden costs between buyers and sellers. Nowadays the
popular online tools available for buying or selling used items are websites
like Craigslist or Ebay. Both are efficient, but they don’t adequately support
mobility requirements. The mobile applications of those websites are just reflections
of their desktop versions; there is no difference in the usability; a certain
casualness, and the “on the go” aspect is still missing. Almost everybody has a
smartphone and uses the support of localization services. Wouldn’t it be better
to have a mobile tool that allows you to buy and sell used stuff efficiently
and at an optimum price – enabling you to do business with someone located in your
neighbourhood? Wouldn’t it also be better to be able to meet your transaction partner
in person, check the quality of the item in real time before making a deal and
without shipping costs, anonymity, abstract pay-pal accounts, or having to pay money to all those third parties for each
transaction? And sometimes people just want to give things away, while others
just want to hire something. They need more flexibility, a platform that takes
their specific wishes into account.</span></span><h1><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/164406/files/20131030122736-2.-so-what-is.png?1383161256"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p></span></span></h1>

sell, rent, exchange, or give away used items based on their proximity and
their category of interest. A customized map allows Geoly users to view their
current position and localize other users (in real time) every time when there
is a match (proximity and category of interest). They can use the app messaging
system to communicate their requirements (buy, sell, rent, exchange or give
away) using photos and text. Furthermore
they can specify subcategories for items in question, and define the maximum distance
for a transaction. Geoly users always meet in person to conclude a deal. It is
another way for people to socialize whilst creating a win-win transaction for the parties involved.</p>

<p>This is

<p>Here the

An alert means: there is something on offer that may be of interest for him. He
can get a detailed information on an item, discard it if not suitable or chat
with the initiator of the post for more information and maybe setting up a
meeting.</p>

<p>To
develop such a powerful application, where everybody with a phone is a
potential customer, we face a number of challenges, the first being to ensure
the service will never stop. We need to make sure that there won’t be any down
time when the service is launched. At the same time we need to tell as many
people as possible about Geoly. To do this, our team developed strategic
approaches for using social media to help spread the app. Also, users can sign
in via Facebook and Twitter, the major social networks out there, and by doing so
they automatically invite all their friends to try the app.</p>
<p>You might
say that’s standard, but in fact this lies at the very core of what we’re about,
because Geoly is only efficient when there are as many people as possible partaking
in transactions in your local area. It will feel natural for each of our users
to convince their friends to join in.That’s why we anticipate an exponential
growth. That is why we need support to handle the infrastructure of our
project.</p>
<p>“Handling”
means high speed, state of the art dedicated servers ready to process any amount
of traffic.</p>
<p>The other
issue is, we are developing for android right now, and we need to develop for
iPhone and Windows phone as well. Therefore, we need to buy tools and we need
to enlarge our team to have at least two more developers for things to move
ahead faster. </p>
<p>We need 60.000
Euros to be able to run the development on the three platforms, secure servers,
support our marketing strategies, have an expert team to meet challenges and professionally
respond to and implement user feed-back.</p>
<p>If we
exceed our goal and raise even more money that would be fantastic for the
project because we will have more capacity to develop efficiently. We will
secure the best servers out there and guarantee a really robust system. And our
marketing will be more effective. If, on the other hand, we raise less than we
asked for, the project will still run, but the challenges we face will be
greater. Aside from money, we need you to help us spread Geoly in your
surroundings when it launches. Thus, please like us on Facebook and follow us
on Twitter.</p>
<p>Geoly is
a community app. The larger the Geoly community, the more fun it will be to use.
And trust us, you will even make new friends, just based on quick deals you can
make. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools to help boost our Indiegogo

time has come to change the way people currently make used item deals within
classic “peer-to-peer” online market places. There is a real need to break some
barriers that are associated with the usual practice in this sector: lack of
trust, usability
frustration, various hidden costs between buyers and sellers. Nowadays the
popular online tools available for buying or selling used items are websites
like Craigslist or Ebay. Both are efficient, but they don’t adequately support
mobility requirements. The mobile applications of those websites are just reflections
of their desktop versions; there is no difference in the usability; a certain
casualness, and the “on the go” aspect is still missing. Almost everybody has a
smartphone and uses the support of localization services. Wouldn’t it be better
to have a mobile tool that allows you to buy and sell used stuff efficiently
and at an optimum price – enabling you to do business with someone located in your
neighbourhood? Wouldn’t it also be better to be able to meet your transaction partner
in person, check the quality of the item in real time before making a deal and
without shipping costs, anonymity, abstract pay-pal accounts, or having to pay money to all those third parties for each
transaction? And sometimes people just want to give things away, while others
just want to hire something. They need more flexibility, a platform that takes
their specific wishes into account.

Geoly is
a community mobile application that brings together people who wish to buy,
sell, rent, exchange, or give away used items based on their proximity and
their category of interest. A customized map allows Geoly users to view their
current position and localize other users (in real time) every time when there
is a match (proximity and category of interest). They can use the app messaging
system to communicate their requirements (buy, sell, rent, exchange or give
away) using photos and text. Furthermore
they can specify subcategories for items in question, and define the maximum distance
for a transaction. Geoly users always meet in person to conclude a deal. It is
another way for people to socialize whilst creating a win-win transaction for the parties involved.

The Geoly
principle: no need to always check the app and browse through a jumble of items
that you might not be interested in. Just register, set your preferred range
and categories, give a short description of the item of interest and wait for an
alert.

interface of the application is very simple and straightforward. Once you

<p>3D Printing is the future! But when we looked at the available 3D printer models on the market, we could not find a single one that delivers high quality printings at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>That`s why we made SparkMaker, an LCD based SLA 3D printer that prints in high-resolution yet has a price that makes it affordable for everyone.    </p>
<div>

<p>   <br/>SparkMaker is compact, beautiful, and user-friendly. At 10 x 6.7 x 6.7 inches (27.5 x 17 x 17 cm) and a weight of only 6.6 pounds (3Kg), the SparkMaker fits perfectly in any office, studio or workshop.</p>
<p>it is small in size but has room where it matters. The SparkMaker 3D printer has a uniform maximum build areas of 4 x 2.2 inches (10.2 x 5.6 cm) and a build height of 5 inches (12.5 cm). </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Printing at 100 micrometer XY resolution and up to 20 micrometer Z layer thickness, SparkMaker has an amazing ability to print in higher resolution compared to DLP 3D printers. </p>
<p>However, an affordable price doesn't mean we compromised on the quality. The 102 x 56 x 125 print area means that SparkMaker is ideal for scale prototyping as well as general 3D printing. </p>

<p>   <br/>With SparkMaker, we wanted to make 3D printing as easy and user-friendly as possible. Unlike other SLA 3D printers that require a computer connection, SparkMaker supports offline printing. </p>
<p>You can forget about connection problems. Simply insert an SD card with a pre-loaded design, press the print button and your creation begins to take shape.</p>

<p>    <br/>Of course, quality is what we strive for when it comes to our 3D printing endeavors. While the majority of today’s FDM printers will produce a decent model, compare an FDM print to one produced by any SLA 3D printer and you’ll quickly see that SLA takes the lead when it comes to the overall quality of finish.<br/>  </p>

3D Printing is the future! But when we looked at the available 3D printer models on the market, we could not find a single one that delivers high quality printings at a reasonable price.
That`s why we made SparkMaker, an LCD based SLA 3D printer that prints in high-resolution yet has a price that makes it affordable for everyone.    


SparkMaker with UV-protective translucent cover
   SparkMaker is compact, beautiful, and user-friendly. At 10 x 6.7 x 6.7 inches (27.5 x 17 x 17 cm) and a weight of only 6.6 pounds (3Kg), the SparkMaker fits perfectly in any office, studio or workshop.
it is small in size but has room where it matters. The SparkMaker 3D printer has a uniform maximum build areas of 4 x 2.2 inches (10.2 x 5.6 cm) and a build height of 5 inches (12.5 cm). 


Building area of 4 x 2.2 inches and a height of 5 inches
 

 
 

 
Printing at 100 micrometer XY resolution and up to 20 micrometer Z layer thickness, SparkMaker has an amazing ability to print in higher resolution compared to DLP 3D printers. 
However, an affordable price doesn't mean we compromised on the quality. The 102 x 56 x 125 print area means that SparkMaker is ideal for scale prototyping as well as general 3D printing. 


 

 

 

   With SparkMaker, we wanted to make 3D printing as easy and user-friendly as possible. Unlike other SLA 3D printers that require a computer connection, SparkMaker supports offline printing. 
You can forget about connection problems. Simply insert an SD card with a pre-loaded design, press the print button and your creation begins to take shape.
One button to start printing
 


Monitoring your print projects is easier too with SparkMaker. It has a jumbo LED light with three different colors to indicate the printing progress.
   
Red, Green, and Blue light for different status
 
 

    Of course, quality is what we strive for when it comes to our 3D printing endeavors. While the majority of today’s FDM printers will produce a decent model, compare an FDM print to one produced by any SLA 3D printer and you’ll quickly see that SLA takes the lead when it comes to the overall quality of finish.  

SparkMaker makes SLA 3D printing truly affordable!
 

   1. Download a 3D print model file from your computer to an SD card.

   2. Insert SD card into SparkMaker & fill printer with the desired resin.    

      3. Press the button and your design begins to print. That`s it!  

 

SparkMaker focuses on improving the printing experience for every printer. We offer basic essential tools for 3D printing including trowel and resin tank. The trowel makes it easy for the printer to slide between the printed object and the build platform. And no worries about how hard to clean the resin tank for next use with an alternative one. 

 

    We want to make 3D printing accessible for everyone, so we use affordable resin too. SparkMaker comes with 5 types of resins, each suitable for different objects you wish to create. Combined with the 5 types of color paste included, you can print 3D object in virtually any color you want.

I have enjoyed using it with an iPad and my iPhone while walking on a treadmill as it is easier to control various apps without having to tap the screen as I am walking. I also think this tiny device would be great for PowerPoint presentations, and I like that it recharges via USB-C. </i></p><p><i>--- <a href=""https://the-gadgeteer.com/2021/02/23/prolab-mouse-review-a-multi-function-bluetooth-controller-the-size-of-a-quarter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The-gadgeteer.com, by Julie Strietelmeier</a></i></p><p> </p><p><i>Personally, I find the ProLab Mouse best used as a wireless presenter. First, the ProLab Mouse is really small and compact, so when you’re presenting, you can look it you’re not holding any presenter stick at all. Second, the different modes offered on the ProLab Mouse provide a versatile suite of features to handle many kinds of presentation. If you have a video link midway through and need to click on it, simply switch to Mouse mode to click. Volume of video too soft? Simply switch to the Media mode to increase volume.</i></p><p><i>--- <a href=""https://techjioblog.com/2021/02/23/review-prolab-mouse-coin-sized/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Techjioblog.com, by Tech Jio</a></i></p><p> </p><p><i>The media controls are also great. You can leave your phone down charging for example and still control playback. I have recently been taking Spanish lessons which often require you to pause the playback so you can figure out a sentence yourself before it gives it to you.

Without question, we’ve designed the smallest and most advanced control hub in the world. Weighing just 8g (.3 oz), the ProLab Mouse puts full control of your smart devices right at your fingertips. This valuable tool for work and play is a combination of an air mouse, a keyboard and a remote PPT/camera /media controller. Using Bluetooth technology, the ProLab Mouse instantly connects to most laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This allows you to control music, videos, web navigation, and more. Change settings at the touch of a button, and enjoy digital control with no limits.The ProLab Mouse is ultra-compact, weighing only 8g and is no larger than a Bluetooth earphone. It is also easy to hold and even easier to use. With its 360-degree rotated trackball and four clicker buttons, it only takes one hand to control dozens of different functions. Once you hold the ProLab Mouse, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.   The ProLab Mouse features three different easy-to-use modes: Air Mouse Mode, Media Mode, and Keyboard Mode. A single touch of the Side Button allows you to easily switch from one mode to the next.  The ProLab Mouse has all functions of an ordinary mouse, and puts an end to the search for mousepads and flat services. With its pioneering Air Mouse mode, conventional controls become a problem of the past. Enjoy full movement via the 360-degree trackball. You can also right-click, left-click, scroll, highlight text, and more. Control your laptop, tablet, or smartphone from up to 10 meters away – no cords required.  Media Mode is designed to control your media player, giving you instant access to the best features of your favorite devices. Effortlessly play music and video or take hands-free photos. Leave that bulky selfie stick at home! Now you can take picture-perfect photos from any distance. Love to play music while you exercise? You can change songs and alter volume without having to touch your device. The exclusive Keyboard Mode functions like arrow and ""Enter"" keys of your laptop. This gives you single-finger control over presentations, videos, documents, and more. Browse files with zero effort or navigate movies from across the room. It couldn't be easier. The three modes of the ProLab Mouse combine to make it the most intuitive digital controller on the planet. Small enough to fit on your finger, it gives you instant power to control all your smart devices. From meetings and presentations to photography and entertainment, everything you need is just a click away.  The Perfect Presentation ToolLooking to give a more dynamic performance? The ProLab Mouse puts your entire presentation in the palm of your hand. Turn pages, scroll, and switch documents in seconds! Then access media to play videos, adjust volume, and more. Your PPT presentation will be a guaranteed show stopper, but you’ll never have to stop and click your laptop.    A Coin-Sized Selfie StickSick of those bulky selfie sticks that still don't capture the moment? The ProLab Mouse has you covered. Now you can get the perfect selfie without all the effort. Simply move the mouse to adjust the focus or lighten the image. Then set up your phone and click away for discreet, hands-free wide shots. Your photos will never feel limited again.    Entertainment Without BoundariesThe ProLab Mouse is a full-service digital controller for music, movies, and more. Simply connect to your device via Bluetooth to gain total control over your entertainment experience. Stop, start, and pause movies and music. Change songs, adjust the volume, and more. Perfect for jogging, exercising, or just lounging around. You'll never need to bother with a remote again.    One Device, Multiple TasksThanks to ProLab Mouse's one-touch functionality, you can switch between multiple modes to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Move effortlessly from browsing the web to playing a movie or answering a phone call – all without having to get up or switch devices. RewardGroundbreaking DesignOur initial idea was to design an intuitive air mouse for laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The goal was to combine the best things about the Blackberry trackball and the ThinkPad TrackPoint, then simplify and scale down the result. However, after testing our new device, we were convinced that we could do better. That’s why we added the Keyboard and Media Modes to create a very powerful and versatile all-in-one device controller.Now you can use the ProLab Mouse for business presentations, taking photos, listening to music, browsing the web, and more. No matter the occasion, full control of your smart devices now fits in the palm of your hand.  User ExperienceTo obtain the most authentic experience from audience, we sent out some prototypes  for testing and review previously. Here's how people use the ProLab Mouse prototypes and what they think about it. Have a check! If you have more questions, you're always welcome to make a comment or send a message to us. This mouse is a new favorite for tech everyday carry (EDC). You get a lot of function with a minimal amount of bulk, which is absolutely fantastic for anyone who appreciates being able to do more with less. It’s comfortable to handle and quite useful once you adjust to the trackball. If you’re a fan or follower of EDC (particularly tech) gear, this mouse fits the bill and delivers as promised. --- The-goodnerd.com, by Stanley Goodner The ProLab Mouse is a handy little gadget that can be used with different devices for different purposes. I have enjoyed using it with an iPad and my iPhone while walking on a treadmill as it is easier to control various apps without having to tap the screen as I am walking. I also think this tiny device would be great for PowerPoint presentations, and I like that it recharges via USB-C. --- The-gadgeteer.com, by Julie Strietelmeier Personally, I find the ProLab Mouse best used as a wireless presenter. First, the ProLab Mouse is really small and compact, so when you’re presenting, you can look it you’re not holding any presenter stick at all. Second, the different modes offered on the ProLab Mouse provide a versatile suite of features to handle many kinds of presentation. If you have a video link midway through and need to click on it, simply switch to Mouse mode to click. Volume of video too soft? Simply switch to the Media mode to increase volume.--- Techjioblog.com, by Tech Jio The media controls are also great. You can leave your phone down charging for example and still control playback. I have recently been taking Spanish lessons which often require you to pause the playback so you can figure out a sentence yourself before it gives it to you. It can be quite cumbersome waking the phone and hitting pause in time to using the ProLab Finger Wireless Mouse makes it really simple.--- irishtechnews, by John

<p>The best way to learn more about this project is to watch
the 5 minute YouTube video I’ve created. 
You can click on the link above to learn more.</p>
<p>But for those of you who like to read, here is my vision:</p>
<p>I want to give people a simple
iPhone app that they can use for just a few minutes per day to do something good.</p>
<p>People spend billions of hours per
year using Facebook, exploring YouTube videos, watching TV, SnapChatting, and
more.  A lot of that time is wasted.</p>
<p>Yet everything I know about people
is that they want to make the world a better place, they want to be part of a
movement, and to do something good.  There
are so many people who want to spread goodness – Young Generations and
Old.  My vision is to make it easy for
them to get involved.</p>
<p>Can you imagine how much good can
be done by millions of people spending just a few minutes per day doing
something fun, easy, and meaningful?</p>
<p>That is the goal of The Good
App.  I hope you join us!<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456616499/fulo7ocfjmc1v2ih3cla.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>I need your help to get it off the
ground.</p>
<p>I’m testing this concept out as a
CrowdFunding effort.  I’m looking to raise a mere $2,500.  That’s not
nearly enough to normally go out and design and build version 1 of an app.
 But I want to engage people in this journey with me.  </p>
<p>Assuming that I can find interested
people and raise at least $2,500 then my wife and I will kick in at least
another $2,500; plus a bunch of time and energy to make this a success.  Also, as the owner of a technology company, I’ll twist the arms of a few really talented
people to help get things off the ground.  With $5,000 plus some hard work,
we can create version 1 of the app.</p>
<p>If we raise more than $2,500 we
will use the extra funds to improve the app, and we can better market the app and gain exposure
so that we can leap out of the gates.</p>
<p>Not a dime from this project goes
into my pocket.  If we’re successful with
this campaign, we’ll register as the appropriate business entity, apply for
non-profit status as needed, and will be fully transparent about the entire
organization and its funds.<span><br/><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">What You Get<br/></span></p>
<p>Everyone who participates by making a contribution or
spreading the word is helping us to launch a world-changing app.  If everyone does a little good, we will
achieve something great.</p>
<p>We have put together some “good” perks that we think our
early contributors will enjoy.  However, because this is an effort based on creating a not-for-profit app rather than a commercial
enterprise, we aren’t going to spend a bunch of money on shirts and other
gifts.  Instead, we are going to put the
money towards building a global community of good.  </p>
<p>If we don’t get to $2,500 worth of contributions then we
will give up on this idea and nobody will be charged any money.  But let’s not let that happen!</p>
<br/>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact<br/></span></p>
<p>We want to help empower people to change the world by doing something good for just a few minutes per day.</p>
<p>What can someone do in just a few
minutes per day?</p>
<p>Here are just a few examples:</p>
<p><b>1.  Inspire someone</b> by sending
a positive note or message to a lonely elderly person, or a sick child in a hospital.  Or, watch some content that inspires the user to
be a better person.

</p>
<p><b>2.  Make money in order to
respond to a crisis.</b>  Say there is a massive earthquake and a city needs
our help.  Our community could all watch a 2 minute video from a sponsor
who would turn that into a generous life-changing donation.

</p>
<p><b>3.  Look for a great cause or
bring awareness to a cause.</b>  There are plenty of great causes in the world
that aren’t getting the attention they deserve. 
I want to make it easier for people to share causes, links, and videos,
in a way that would make a giant difference to a small charity or
organization.  

</p>
<p><b>4.  Guided meditation or
prayer.</b>  Positive thought inspires
positive change.  So we make it easier
for you to practice moments of mindfulness or prayer in an effort to spread
good.

</p>
<p><b>5. 
Crowd Sourcing. </b> Do actual work by
coming together and spending a few minutes helping to cure cancer, catch a
criminal, or solve a scientific problem that is better done by humans than
computers.  Sound crazy?  It isn’t. 
This type of work is being done today and together we can make a huge
difference.<br/><br/>
<b> 6. 
Share The Good App with others.</b> 
Of course, the more people who get involved, the bigger the impact will
be.  We want to make it fun and rewarding
for people to share The Good App with others, and get people into the habit of
spending a few minutes per day doing something positive.</p>

<br/><span><br/></span>There are many other examples, and
many we haven’t thought of yet.  In fact,
we want to encourage our growing community to help develop new ideas for
micro-volunteering that would take just minutes of action per day.  It’s also our goal to let people’s
preferences steer their experience with the app.  You’ll be able to customize the app so that
it works for you, inspires you, and keeps you doing good.  Over time, we’ll find category curators and
we’ll offer different styles of doing “good” to match the individual interests
of our members.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Experience<br/></span></p>
<p>Over the past 13 years I’ve built 4
different internet technology companies that focus on helping sales professionals
to be more successful.  We have a team of roughly 30 people serving 100s
of thousands of customers.  One of our apps, FaxBurner, has been
downloaded more than 500,000 times.  <br/><br/>So I understand technology and have a
great team of people that knows how to get stuff done.  With this project,
many of them will be kind enough to volunteer to help.  But they have jobs
and families, like myself, so we need some outside funding and help in order to
get this going.</p>

<p>I think the main risk with this project is that our
community won’t be passionate enough to spread the word to others.  To make a real impact, we are going to need
10’s of thousands of users who are actively engaged.  But without a marketing budget, we are
relying on our community of friends and users to continue to spread the
word.  </p>
<p>I believe we are up to the challenge and the viral nature of
the internet will help us achieve our goals. 
Part of the reason for this IndieGogo campaign is to see whether the
community will grow over the next month before we invest any further time and

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On 22 May, 2018, the source code to Qualcomm Eudora, an almost ineffably influential e-Mail client, was released into the public domain under the BSD Licence, clearing the way for its development to continue as a faithful, community-based, Open Source continuation.  Unfortunately, as originally released, it depends on several strictly commercial libraries, and we at Team HERMES, the organisation formed to develop it, were for several months at a total loss on how to proceed.  For a time, we attempted to create a fully non-commercial version, following the GNU ethos, but this was doomed to failure, largely because Eudora is an application of mind-bending complexity, and writing a new user-interface for it would take an enormous team of developers many hours.  We had neither.</p>
<p>By late 2019, however, we'd taken a pragmatic approach and had a version that compiled properly, though it still refused to link.  This month, we are proud to announce that HERMES Mail---the new name for Eudora, as that is still protected by trademark law---compiles, links, and launches (though it crashes soon thereafter).  We now have a different sort of job on our hands: fixing the bugs that make HERMES Mail unusable, and turning it into a viable, fully-featured e-Mail client.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>HERMES Mail is currently at a critical, make-or-break point in the development lifecycle.  For the time being, our issues in regards to the RogueWave Stingray libraries have been resolved, but we still face significant expenses; in particular, payroll has become a significant bottleneck, as we do wish to get this product to you as soon as possible and it has become abundantly clear that doing so with purely volunteer resources is close to impossible.</p>
<p>We know that this is likely a difficult time to ask for contributions or investments, but even five or ten dollars can make a big difference in whether we can afford to bring in that extra developer, or whether we can advertise to reach as broad an audience as possible, or pay hosting fees---because that isn't free, either. We've therefore set the goal at an entirely reasonable $800 Cdn., which would help defray some of the manpower costs (the standard rate is between $30 and $50 Cdn. per hour).  That said, this is a floor, not a ceiling; we are happy to receive contributions exceeding this amount, and we promise you value proportional to the contributions we <i>do</i> get.</p>
<p>Thanks to our generous contributors, the eventual release of HERMES Mail 8.0 is a near-certainty.  Your investment has guaranteed the ongoing development of a best-in-class, enterprise grade e-Mail client built for power users on Windows and Linux (with the assistance of WINE).  As we promised in our initial Kickstarter campaign, HERMES Mail 8.0 will bring ""language support"" front and centre.  It will come with as many as 80 foreign-language dictionaries, along with<strong> UTF-8 support, so international messages won't get mangled</strong>.  It will also feature a new HTML viewer, so ""testimonial"" messages using styled text and fancy invisible-table layouts won't get mangled, either.</p>
<p>Equally, any funds you give us now are not donations, in sensu stricto, but rather investments in our future as a software company: <i>do ut des</i> is the order of the day.  ""I give, so that you give,"" and what we give you is our genuine promise that HERMES Mail will not be a ""one-shot deal"".   We plan to continue its development as a <strong>faithful</strong> continuation of Qualcomm Eudora, had the project been allowed to continue on its original trajectory.  In our view, this means preserving as much of the Eudora user experience as practical, while enhancing those features already present and introducing innovative new ones.  We aim to be the premier solution for power users and institutions seeking a professional-grade electronic mail solution.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At this moment in time, there is no e-Mail client in active development that</p>
<ol>
<li>is free to download, let alone Open Source;</li>
<li>runs on your computer, as opposed to being a cloud service used as a software substitute; and</li>
<li>has a broad range of advanced features, especially those that help combat spam and bulk ""testimonial"" mail. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are, for example, services that are feature-packed and free to use, but don't run on <i>your</i> computer (and therefore require trust, something that is rightfully in short supply), and there is software that is free-to-download and runs on your computer, but is the most rudimentary imaginable e-Mail client.<i>  </i>Our software fills this lacuna. </p>
<p>We have been successful in creating two software projects already: a file-transfer application in the early 2010's, as well as a new Transport Layer Security library for Eudora 7.  We hope that our prior successes help assure you of the genuineness of our future endeavours.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this moment in time, there is one enormous (and tiny) risk.  Most people will have heard of it:  its name begins with the word <i>corona</i>.  This infection seriously threatens cash flow: there is now the prospect of having the application finished, but insufficient funds to keep the lights on and the servers humming.</p>
<p>This is not something that lends itself easily to mitigation; the only thing we can do is to maintain adequate cash flow as best as we are able.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>We provide enterprise-grade business software via our server app store. Additionally we offer services to fully cover all aspects of your business, giving you full power and control, while reducing cost, increasing security, giving full privacy and making IT and AI finally work for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519393818/tljomnsu0zzk8o1r4bv6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In just 5-10 minutes you can stop worrying about Office 365, Dynamics 365, Google Suite and all other services scattered around the internet. Getting on board takes just a few clicks, and our fully automated system will set you up with your own private cloud where you can install all the software you and your team need to run your business.</p>
<p>No limitations per inbox, account, user, megabyte or email.</p>
<p>No complex installations, setups, calling your IT wizard, failures and errors.</p>
<p>No privacy or security concerns for you or your clients.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where your emails, appointments, documents, reports, invoices, orders, clients, projects, tasks, chats, to do lists, forms, web sites, holidays, recruitment, and all other crucial, time consuming efforts in your business, live together in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where you have powerful AI on your side, helping you run your business, collaborate efficiently, and work smarter.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of AppsForce.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Usually you need to buy a domain, set up DNS records to point to the server. Ah, yes - you need to buy a server. And install Linux, SSH, log in via command prompt and use text commands to install and setup MYSQL, Apache, PHP, and hundreds of other software products and patches, and then configure it all. What could go wrong? Furthermore, you have to get every software setup and install plugins to make them work together (with all limitations). Then create all user accounts in each app, pass invitations around, create passwords, deal with everybody who cannot login, does not know how to use it, and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519393990/pdufwnternmrfkiqll8c.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, enough. We build AppsForce. The three step wizard asks you for your domain name, server size and whether you want our support (all optional). Then, the magic happens! Our installer sets everything up for you.</p>
<p>In 5 minutes you can simply go to your new domain and login. Click on myStore, just like on your mobile and click 'install' on any app you want. Takes a minute or two for everything to get set up and ready to use. That's it. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
</div><div>As you know - big corporations collect as much data from you as they can. That data is what makes them worth billions. Your data - and you get nothing for it. Have you ever sat down to read the Terms &amp; Conditions from likes of Google or Facebook? It's scary. We decided not to collect a single bit of information from you - ever. Sound good?</div><div> </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519408704/zploa7wlnm3ykes31lcv.png"" src=""""/></div><div> </div><div>Big cloud services face hundreds of hacking attempts every second! Very often they do get hacked. Nobody will openly admit this, much less inform you about it when you sign up. That is why we think having a private cloud for every single user is a much better solution. If one gets hacked, all other are still safe. And the unlucky user can run a smart-recovery, which gets them back up and running in 15 minutes! On top of that, we have all the latest security features, from encryption to VPN. Also, the central management, where you have full control of who has access to what, protects you from deliberate or accidental damaging actions of your employees.</div><div> </div><div> </div><div>
<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>Well, you do not need to get domain. You can use an IP, Intranet, or even Dark-Net Onion URLs.</p>
<p>You do not need to use our server. Any computer will do. That old one in your garage or even a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>You can use the whole lot, for free - forever.</p>
<p>You can even earn money by selling your own plugins, software and services to other users.</p>
<p>Or make money by reselling all our services to your clients.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Apps do I get?</h3>
<p>We will offer the 25 most common business apps at the launch. As the product and eco-system grows there will be many more. Just check out our perks for examples. All of those are apps ready for you.</p>

<p>Great. Every app looks and feels the same, so it is very easy to understand the menus and tools. You can learn it in a few minutes!

We provide enterprise-grade business software via our server app store. Additionally we offer services to fully cover all aspects of your business, giving you full power and control, while reducing cost, increasing security, giving full privacy and making IT and AI finally work for you.
 

 
In just 5-10 minutes you can stop worrying about Office 365, Dynamics 365, Google Suite and all other services scattered around the internet. Getting on board takes just a few clicks, and our fully automated system will set you up with your own private cloud where you can install all the software you and your team need to run your business.
No limitations per inbox, account, user, megabyte or email.
No complex installations, setups, calling your IT wizard, failures and errors.
No privacy or security concerns for you or your clients.
Imagine a world where your emails, appointments, documents, reports, invoices, orders, clients, projects, tasks, chats, to do lists, forms, web sites, holidays, recruitment, and all other crucial, time consuming efforts in your business, live together in perfect harmony.
Imagine a world where you have powerful AI on your side, helping you run your business, collaborate efficiently, and work smarter.
Welcome to the world of AppsForce.
 
How does it work?
Usually you need to buy a domain, set up DNS records to point to the server. Ah, yes - you need to buy a server. And install Linux, SSH, log in via command prompt and use text commands to install and setup MYSQL, Apache, PHP, and hundreds of other software products and patches, and then configure it all. What could go wrong? Furthermore, you have to get every software setup and install plugins to make them work together (with all limitations). Then create all user accounts in each app, pass invitations around, create passwords, deal with everybody who cannot login, does not know how to use it, and so on.
 

 
Well, enough. We build AppsForce. The three step wizard asks you for your domain name, server size and whether you want our support (all optional). Then, the magic happens! Our installer sets everything up for you.
In 5 minutes you can simply go to your new domain and login. Click on myStore, just like on your mobile and click 'install' on any app you want. Takes a minute or two for everything to get set up and ready to use. That's it. 
 
Privacy and Security
As you know - big corporations collect as much data from you as they can. That data is what makes them worth billions. Your data - and you get nothing for it. Have you ever sat down to read the Terms & Conditions from likes of Google or Facebook? It's scary. We decided not to collect a single bit of information from you - ever. Sound good?  Big cloud services face hundreds of hacking attempts every second! Very often they do get hacked. Nobody will openly admit this, much less inform you about it when you sign up. That is why we think having a private cloud for every single user is a much better solution. If one gets hacked, all other are still safe. And the unlucky user can run a smart-recovery, which gets them back up and running in 15 minutes! On top of that, we have all the latest security features, from encryption to VPN. Also, the central management, where you have full control of who has access to what, protects you from deliberate or accidental damaging actions of your employees.  
What else?
Well, you do not need to get domain. You can use an IP, Intranet, or even Dark-Net Onion URLs.
You do not need to use our server. Any computer will do. That old one in your garage or even a Raspberry Pi.
 

 
You can use the whole lot, for free - forever.
You can even earn money by selling your own plugins, software and services to other users.
Or make money by reselling all our services to your clients.
 

What Apps do I get?
We will offer the 25 most common business apps at the launch. As the product and eco-system grows there will be many more. Just check out our perks for examples. All of those are apps ready for you.

Now, you might ask if our apps are any good. Well - all of them have been around for years, and regularly have user bases that run into the millions. They are good.

Feel free to browse our store, and see what is there for you.

All apps are easier to install than your mobile apps. It takes one click, and it is even faster.

<p>Kowalo gives all stock traders a score based on their performance in the market-place. The better you do, the higher your score is. Kowalo lets users find higher scoring members and follow them for 30 days (you can't change who you follow for 30 days unless you surpass their score and Pro Members can follow higher scoring members than Free Members.) You get a push notification whenever the person you follow buys or sells a stock and you have the option to match that stock and buy/sell as many shares as you want.  The better you do, the higher your score. In addition to that, Pro Members get paid commission for every Pro Follower and Referral they get every single month. Kowalo rewards its members by giving back 50% of Pro Memberships back to the users. The better you do, the more followers you get, the more followers you get, the more money you make to put back in stocks or save up and buy that dream car boat house statue you always wanted.</p>
<h3>About Kowalo</h3>
<p>Kowalo started as a text group with about 10 people wanting to follow our founder's trades and know when he bought/sold stocks. In the first week, his text group averaged about 20% gains, word of the group spread and soon there were requests from over 120 people that wanted in the text group. Unfortunately, keeping up with the text group was pretty difficult and the idea of creating mentor/follower relationship with automated push-notifications within an app was created.</p>
<p>Austin James is the founder of Kowalo and is a passionate trader. He started in the workforce at age 15 and his ability to innovate and lead drove his career to leading large teams of dozens of nationally syndicated reality tv shows and feature films by the age of 25. His focus on quality and making a positive impact through charity will drive the company's culture and make the app consistently better with every update.</p>

<h3>InspiredKids as a secret tool for parents</h3>
<p>The role of a parent in general and father, in particular, has rapidly evolved and any working parent is expected to spend quality time with their children. However, they don’t have time to come up with new activities for their young ones, they also don’t have time to browse through every website for informative and inspirational parent’s blogs, all they need is to make their children happy and make them feel good about themselves. InspiredKids app comes in handy to help parents out there to be the most creative. </p>
<p>Our team of co-founders have been working in management consulting firm when we faced the challenge of managing busy schedule and parenthood joys, soon discovering, we were not alone. We also realized there was a simple solution, and this is how an idea to tackle a daily challenge turned into this smart product.</p>
<p>We believe that by enabling parents to be their best while inspiring their children daily we do contribute to the co-creation of a happier and healthier future. </p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>
<strong>Inspire your child daily</strong> - a few people have time to browse dozens of resources and websites with recommendations, while “fighting” commercials and pop up ads. InspiredKids app gives you enough choice but it is not overwhelming - offering three easy-to-do, engaging in real life, joyful activities - daily</li>
<li>
<strong>Learn something new together</strong> - there is a curated video playlist for you and your child - there are no ""nonsense"" cartoons, we select videos that are useful, practical and beautiful</li>
<li>
<strong>Every day counts</strong> - every time you create memories by playing an activity with your child you can see it in the app Calendar. Check sweet memories, repeat the favourite ones.</li>

<h3>What InspiredKids app doesn't do</h3>
<p>Privacy and safety are crucial for any product, but especially when we are talking about our children. InspiredKids is a tool for a parent. The prime user of the app is an adult. The only interaction with the app a child can have when a parent would like to watch suggested video playlist together. We do not collect or store data on user's child. We recommend the activities for children 3-5-year-old, yet it is to the full discretion of a parent to decide if e.g. he would like to use recommended activities for his child who is younger or older the recommended age. On top of this, InspiredKids app doesn't have an advertisement inside the app. </p>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>Our team of talented developers and designers are working on bringing the full version of InspiredKids app to you. </p>
<ul>
<li>60% of raised funds will go to the development (enhanced UX, new features including customization, upgrade of the video player) </li>
<li>40% of raised funds will go to content development </li>

<p>Thank you so much for checking out our project and your support. We hope the InspiredKids app can help you to be the best version of parent you want to be - while spending precious time with your children, inspiring them daily!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>During our initial launch of InspredKids app earlier this year we learnt a lot, we have experienced ups and downs. The critical aspect of building a useful and beautiful tool for customers - team communication, tech skills and quality of content - engaging, educational and appropriate for children age 3-5 year old.</p>
<p>We have hired a strong creative team of developers, we have formalized partnerships with content creators specializing in early child development.</p>
<p>That said, we are aware, unexpected challenges come up. We do all precautious measures to complete crash tests before the official launch, however, as in any app, the first iteration can have some minor bugs that we will promptly address within a number of days, if happens. During our pilot launch, we experienced one crash - all users who were affected by it during those 4 days were offered 3 months free of charge app subscription.</p>
<p>Our goal is to help the busy parents to be the best version of themselves, while raising their children, creating future. Feel free to reach out to us at hello@thebiggerthings.com anytime you have a thought, idea, or question.</p>

When should I use the InspiredKids app?</i></u></p><p>Daily, there is nothing more powerful than creating special moments be it only a 15 min play with your child. We understand that all professionals have different time schedules, cities - have different weather conditions, therefore daily we offer a selection of 3 activities to give you flexibility and comfort of selecting the one most appropriate for the time of the day you decide to spend together with your child.</p><p><u><i>Q5. What if I do not want to watch videos?</i></u></p><p>We understand that some of the parents actually prefer to limit the time that child spends with a mobile device - therefore video playlist is optional and is only 20-min long. You can watch it together, you can watch even by yourself - many customers (adults) enjoy our curation because they learn something new from the videos that they can narrate, share with a child in person after.</p><p><u><i>Q6. How long does activity take to complete?</i></u></p><p>In this new launch, we introduce customization: every day you launch the app and you are asked about the time available for a play today. Based on your selection (&lt;15 min, 15-30 min, 50-60 min) three activities are offered for you.</p></div>","InspiredKids as a secret tool for parents

We understand that all professionals have different time schedules, cities - have different weather conditions, therefore daily we offer a selection of 3 activities to give you flexibility and comfort of selecting the one most appropriate for the time of the day you decide to spend together with your child.Q5. What if I do not want to watch videos?We understand that some of the parents actually prefer to limit the time that child spends with a mobile device - therefore video playlist is optional and is only 20-min long. You can watch it together, you can watch even by yourself - many customers (adults) enjoy our curation because they learn something new from the videos that they can narrate, share with a child in person after.Q6. How long does activity take to complete?In this new launch, we introduce customization: every day you launch the app and you are asked about the time available for a play today. Based on your selection (<15 min, 15-30 min, 50-60 min) three activities are offered for you.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

And in this case, it was in fact my mother who inspired FotoJelly. I saw how frustrating it was for her as well as other family &amp; friends to easily share photos of birthdays, outings and other events captured with their smartphones – I call it “Foto Rodeo”, trying to rustle up photos from everyone.</p>
<p>Sure, they could learn to use hashtags, how to ""stream"" their photos, email everyone links to a photo archive, etc. But they aren't intuitive solutions for the 80%. I wanted to develop an application that integrated with the social networks, calendars, and event services they already use, to create and share albums easily, and do it in real time.</p>
<h1>The FotoJelly Vision</h1>
<p>Our vision is simple: the best suite of photo sharing apps and services available first for Windows Phone 8, Windows 8 App Store, other smartphones, and beyond.</p>
<p>We'll start with a mobile app that doesn’t require you to be a techie or social <img alt=""Mockup"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fotojelly.com/wp-content/uploads/fjmockup1.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>media expert. You simply create or join a “Jelly” that’s been associated with a particular activity or event you are part of. You, along with everyone else,  begin capturing and sharing fotos.</p>
<ul>
<li>The album automatically adapts to the time, date and [optionally] venue/location of the event, assuring everyone that all the fotos captured and shared are relevant (e.g., no more Christmas fotos showing up in your Spring Break album!)</li>
<li>By default, these fotos are only shared with those you invite. They can be made public to allow others to view and comment on. You can also cross-post your fotos to Facebook and twitter, customize them with filters &amp; stickers, etc.</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""FotoJelly Event Albums"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fotojelly.com/wp-content/uploads/phone_img4.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>For event hosts, businesses and marketers, you’re no longer held hostage by hashtags, the technical equivalents to cats, where you never really own them and have no idea whether they will eventually cause your event or brand <img alt=""FotoJelly QR Code"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fotojelly.com/wp-content/uploads/qrcode_phone.png"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px;""/>trouble later on. Instead, you create the album and invite event guests, customers or the general public to participate. Should you want to cross-post to social networks or attach a hashtag, you are free to do so. The key is this: you always own the experience and can define the context of the content.</p>
<p>The app will be free - you don't have to be a paid member of the FotoJelly site to use the app or share fotos via social networks. Supporters of our project at the $25 level or above will get access to special versions of the app with premium capabilities unlocked. <strong> </strong></p>
<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>We have gone from concept and prototype to testing with users, iterating on our initial ideas and improving the product along the way. Our Founder graduated from a tech incubator, using the opportunity to refine the vision and develop an alpha project.<img alt=""Founder Institute"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fotojelly.com/wp-content/uploads/fi_graduate_logo.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px;""/></p>
<p>During that time we were recognized by Microsoft and our developer community peers for our beta effort and the uniqueness of our app.</p>

<h1>The Perks</h1>
<p>We have a lot of great rewards lined up for our supporters, everything from beta access to FotoJelly-branded swag and  invites to our launch parties in Chicago or Seattle. And, every pledge of $8 or more will receive a limited-edition badge displayed in their User Profile within the app.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong><em>What platforms will FotoJelly be available on?<br/></em></strong>We are super fans of Windows Phone, and will continue to prioritize development to that device. But, we do understand that we have to support additional platforms to generate the scale of users we need to make FotoJelly an unqualified success.</p>
<p><strong><em>How much does the FotoJelly app cost?<br/></em></strong>The app will be free and feature-rich as described. We do believe there is an audience for premium and professional features and capabilities that would further enhance the FotoJelly experience to a select segment of our customer base, and will offer early access as reward for significant pledges.</p>
<p><strong><em>How does FotoJelly deal with privacy issues?<br/></em></strong>By default, all Jellies are private to the Host and the individuals who are invited. Fotos uploaded to or taken within the FotoJelly app can be deleted by the user who submitted them, even after the Jelly has been closed. We do not own your photos. And while we may use advertisement to support our products, there will never be a direct or implied associatio made to our users or their photos.</p>
<h1>Risks and challenges</h1>
<p>The primary risk to any software project's success would be the ability of the team to develop the app and release it to the public. We’ve proven our ability to execute and have been recognized by Microsoft and our developer peers for our ability to do so well. As experienced developers, product managers, and business leaders you can be assured we will communicate our progress regularly, regularly assess our performance and address challenges head on, ultimately reaching our goal and delivering a great product. </p></div>","Our Story
