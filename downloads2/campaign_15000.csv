<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a mother-to-be interested in working towards being a stay at home parent! I've been doing my art for years, but haven't had the opportunity to complete an entire volume of comics---that is, until now!</p>
<p>The comic will follow Nappy Queen (a mother of color) as she navigates this often f***ed up universe. The strips are funny, educational, creative, and sometimes political. This campaign is meant to kick start that dream by helping me get the word out about Nappy Queen. Getting this initial $500 will allow me to complete a full volume, make copies, and start promoting my work online, in competitions, and at events. I will also be able to hire temporary a youth intern to help me move units.</p>
<p>I created NappyQueen.com because I know my art is worth the time and effort it takes to get it out to more people. Our community needs something for us and BY US!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Charleston, South Carolina, not as big a city as Los Angeles or New York, a place with normal everyday crime. So it didn’t take much to grab headlines when four teenage girls come up missing and are later discovered sexually assaulted and mutilated. In the summer months that followed, reports and speculations put the city in a state of panic over a man preying on young girls</p>
<p>My name is Tracey Claverie.  I have been around comics for 18 years. I have been an attendee at San Diego Comic Con for as many years as well. With each year that passed, I became more passionate writing comics. Finally, a story came along that I feel passionate about. My 9 to 5 is working for a police department in southern california(I am NOT an officer) for the last 18 years. With each page you will feel the passion I have for this project.  </p>
The funding I receive will go towards printing and advertising cost. This includes printing of the book, postcards, and posters. Over the past year I financed the first two issues of the four issue series by my self and would like to finish the last two issues.</div>
<div>
<p>2013 is the year the entire story will be presented as a graphic novel at Comic Con. I feel strongly about this project because of the inner struggle we all can relate to. I tell this story with this in mind.</p>
<p>These perks will be the only ones given of this kind. So this would be quite a treat for those collectors out.</p>

<p>My name is Zorica I'm an illustrator and graphic designer with a BA in Fine Arts. I'm originally from Yuogoslavia, but came to America to study art as a teen and have been here ever since. I like to work in youth volunteer groups to help give something back and that leads me too why this project is important to me.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned as a volunteer teaching art to at risk teens is...a lot of them just didn't like art. At least my group didn't and it was a learning experience. Getting someone to paint a dog is one thing, having to get the security guard escort to get them back into the class is another!</p>
<p>Two things stood out to me though in this experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>The reason why art was so difficult for them was because they didn't think they could do it. I broke that thought pattern by making them draw a face using a grid. SURPISE! They're jaws dropped and ears opened. A little.</li>
<li>Positive imagry and role modles are important. There is a pervasive defeatist pattern in the minds of ask-risk youth, and to be quite honest, they just don't have anyone to look up to but themselves. It's a vicious pattern.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a story idea in my head, and when I explained it to the artist on the project, everything came together. In the end we came up with a concept that seemed good enought to hold the interest of young adults as well as hopefully create a positive image in thier minds. The over all theme being that a hero is what YOU make it...so now we just need help to get it going.</p>
</div>
That's where you wonderful folks come in!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We need your help making this book a reality, because quite frankly...I have no more funds to pay any contributing artists working to put this book together.</div>
<div>
<h3>What Do I Need The Funds For?</h3>
<p>Essentially:</p>
<ul>
<li>A professional colorist to finish the pencil and inked pages.</li>
<li>A professional letterer to letter the comics (this is my attempts in the samples)</li>
<li>Money to pay the artist as well as cover publishing, materials, shipping, and other costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The comic itself is going to be part of a series of books broken down into six volumes in a classic comic book format.</p>
<p><br/>Hopefully this start will help peak further interest.</p>

The over all theme being that a hero is what YOU make it...so now we just need help to get it going.

That's where you wonderful folks come in!
 
We need your help making this book a reality, because quite frankly...I have no more funds to pay any contributing artists working to put this book together.

What Do I Need The Funds For?
Essentially:

A professional colorist to finish the pencil and inked pages.
A professional letterer to letter the comics (this is my attempts in the samples)
Money to pay the artist as well as cover publishing, materials, shipping, and other costs.

The comic itself is going to be part of a series of books broken down into six volumes in a classic comic book format.
Hopefully this start will help peak further interest.




The comic itself is about an awkward teenager who through a freak accident gains the ability to transform into a superhero. Through this series of transformations the teen deveolps an understanding of himself, his role in the world, and learns to appreciate the power he had all along.

<p>Currently, I am creating an artists rendition of sexy comic girls based off of your favorite characters. Similar to whats in the cosplay world, these are my artist rendition of 12 comic girls. I am using actual models to portray these characters and creating the outfits from various fabrics and pre-existing apparel.  I am a huge fan of the sexy side of these beautiful characters, and I want you to have a chance to own some of the LIMITED prints. </p>

<h3>Why do I need your help?</h3>
<div>Simple! The costs I am incurring, along the creative process, can easily pile up with makeup/hair stylists, custom costumes and accessories. I am looking for the amazing fans of the comic world to help fund the remaining characters.  In exchange, you get some cool collectible fan art with your contribution. </div> <ul> <li>Currently I am looking at the funding basics ($800) so I am able to complete this project</li> <li>The perks that I will be providing will be items that may not be reproduced in these forms of media I/E collectible trading cards, 11x17 posters, photo book (in comic print form), a 12 month 2016 calendar and much more. </li> <li>The more contributions I receive, the more characters I can create and better quality collectibles I can offer to you, the fan. Anything past my $800 goal will contribute to better costumes, perks etc...</li> </ul>

<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I am looking to make a small impact in the massive comic world!

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello everyone! 
I am Daveed Benito, a 9 year seasoned photographer. Over the years, I have developed many new and exciting skills in photography and photo manipulation. Now I am looking to let you in on a special project of mine.
Currently, I am creating an artists rendition of sexy comic girls based off of your favorite characters. Similar to whats in the cosplay world, these are my artist rendition of 12 comic girls. I am using actual models to portray these characters and creating the outfits from various fabrics and pre-existing apparel.  I am a huge fan of the sexy side of these beautiful characters, and I want you to have a chance to own some of the LIMITED prints. 
Characters already created:


 -Poison Ivy   Model: @imbrettrossi                                                                                                   -Black Widow Model: @Mysti_Moon                                                                                                -Black Canary  Model: @purrbunny                                                                                                 -Black Cat Model:   @Mysti_Moon                                                                                                   -Emma Frost  Model: @KristiVeera (my beautiful wife)                                                             -Super Girl  Model: Whitney Rochelle                                                                                             -Harley Quinn  Model: @purrbunny                                                                                                -PsyLocke Model @sass_xo                                                                                                              -Wonderwoman (coming soon)




Why do I need your help?
Simple! The costs I am incurring, along the creative process, can easily pile up with makeup/hair stylists, custom costumes and accessories. I am looking for the amazing fans of the comic world to help fund the remaining characters.  In exchange, you get some cool collectible fan art with your contribution.   Currently I am looking at the funding basics ($800) so I am able to complete this project The perks that I will be providing will be items that may not be reproduced in these forms of media I/E collectible trading cards, 11x17 posters, photo book (in comic print form), a 12 month 2016 calendar and much more.  The more contributions I receive, the more characters I can create and better quality collectibles I can offer to you, the fan. Anything past my $800 goal will contribute to better costumes, perks etc... 



   The Impact I am looking to make a small impact in the massive comic world! This is only the beginning, and with a successful campaign I will create a set of my own characters that have never been seen before. They will have back stories with the potential for their own comic book, plus they get sexier.
With your help, I will continue to make new and exciting characters following some of the upcoming major comic based movies.
    Risks & Challenges  So far, the risks of this project are minimal considering 9 characters are completed. Being in the photography business for 9 years has helped me meet some amazing print companies and models, so I have all of the resources at my finger tips. Many of the perks will already be in stock to eliminate wait times for shipments.
The only challenge I have is reaching you the fan! So far I have plenty of models willing to be apart of this project including a few playboy models ;)
I have my own studio and plenty of time to complete or add new characters within days if I want.

<p><strong>THE STORY OF THE DRAGOS</strong></p>
<p>In a world that has been decimated and destroyed, an ancient sect of beings, dragon shifters called The Dragos, have risen to power. Only a remnant of humanity remains and their survival hinges on their choosing to fight or surrender to The Dragos. When Salya Salastine’s younger brother goes missing in the barren lands that’s left of civilization, Salya ventures out to find him and faces the dangers of Earth’s new rulers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535082640/vgfkngfk4jcwpgugptcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Crowding of Dragos is about love. It’s a paranormal shifter romance story. But we are introduced to the concept of love through a sister’s fight for survival — she is fighting to get to her brother, who’s somewhere lost in a world that’s viscous and is ruled by powerful shifter beings. Salya is willing to risk life and limb for him, she stands up against those who warn her that her journey is impossible. That’s where the story takes its roots — the true nature of what is love — loves impossibility but yet its inevitability and durability. </p>

<p>But sibling love is just the beginning. Again, The Crowding of Dragos is a paranormal shifter romance story so Salya’s journey will force her to face herself and all that is good and bad about who she is and what this world ruled by Dragon Shifters has done to her. Her hate for the Dragos will only be measured by her love for her brother and humanity, and just maybe somehow those two will blur and somehow possibly become one when a Shifter saves her life...</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Help bring to life this epic tale that journeys through decisions which ultimately affects the fate of the planet Eaton.</p>
<p>Greetings! I am Mathew Jobson, lead illustrator, project manager and creative director for the independent comic Eaton's Exxodus and I want to tell you about our indie comic and why you should invest in us and in our project.  This project is a collaboration of the talent and the hard work of four individuals; Chad Glass, David Padilla, Samuel Escamilla the creator of the story and myself. We work together to bring to life the truly epic tale that decides the fate of the planet Eaton. This world is both like and unlike Earth and is locked in a timeless struggle for the fate of the planet.  </p>
<p>This story has been on the mind of creator Samuel Escamilla for a long time and I have been impressed with his drive and focus ever since we met two years ago. Some of the characters were actual people, who had for one reason or another, made an impact in his life. This project took on an even deeper emotional weight for Sam with the tragic passing of his longtime friend who sadly never got to see the story in person. For this reason and for the encouragement this friend gave to Samuel he has been written into the story and has become a major character in the Epic tale.</p>
<p>The attention drawn to our comic will also serve as an opportunity to do good in our hometown of San Marcos, Texas. In the spirit of doing good with this project we are committing 15% of the funds collected in this crowdfunding campaign to be given to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children fund. This organization resonates with the team and the personal ties to some of the characters. We will post the amount we were able to give on our website exxoduscomic.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are setting our goal at $2000 so we can continue making Sam's story a tangible experience for our readers. This money will compensate our team for the hours of work that goes into the planning, drawing, editing, marketing and promoting this project as well as cover the expenses of our Launch Party on August the 11th. This money will also provide our author and creator Sam with some much-needed support after single handedly funding this entire effort!</p>
<p>We are offering several perks at different levels of participation. ""Bio Luminescence"" is a four-page action-packed nugget of mayhem and was created to give people a introduction to the world of Eaton's Exxodus as well as to be a loving memorial. In this issue, we will highlight our community partners as well as offer details relating to the charity that you will be simultaneously supporting. We have created several unique products including tee shirts and laser etched coasters and wooden trading cards. We are even offering cameo appearances in upcoming issues as well as making our supporters into actual reoccurring characters. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to learn a little bit about our comic Eaton's Exxodus and thank you for supporting our project!</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a group of people (in real life or even across the internet) who acted like their own little despotic kingdom?  If you disagree with them in the most polite way, they become hysterical and attack.  They worship their central figures or high councils, and enforce the hierarchy even if one shouldn't exist, especially if they claim there is no ranking and that they are all equal, in which you have now accidentally caught them in hypocrisy that they will attack you for pointing out.  If you watch them long enough they begin turning on each other and expelling people one by one, shrinking further and further until they collapse.  An echo chamber, or a hugbox, you might've seen them called.  This is a story for anyone who's seen them in action, from outside or within.  It's a story about the lack of self awareness they have, and the damage that can ensue, but also about the lessons you can learn from their bad examples.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our goofy SWC-style story pitch</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>When an enormously titted young woman shows up in the village surrounding a massive ancient historical tower known for its beautiful beacon of light, she comes to find that the tower is crumbling and on the verge of collapse!  Working with the locals, can she help keep this historical treasure from being destroyed before it's too late?  Find out in the conspicuously titled Inevitably Doomed.</p>
<p>Written by the first ever gray/mauve ace-demisexual panfluid gendernormative writers of color in comics, Ran’Deesha Diaz and Raymond Porse are ushering in a new era of Comic Liberty on par with classic works such as Princess Highground and Tails Gets Trolled.  These creators are hoping to bring Some Wonderful Creations (or SWC for short) to the world of comics.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Primarily to the artist.  It's $3000 total for the raw lines, then another $3000 for coloring, so it's $6000 total to be able to make this comic in its entirety, so the goal is $7000 to cover the Indiegogo fees and any extra emergency costs.  Ray and I won't be receiving this money, we'll simply be using it to fund the art.  If we get more than that we'll be splitting it with the artist(s).</p>
<h3>Stretch goals</h3>
<p>If we reach $9,000 I can potentially have Literally #2 (the next issue of our first comic) made at the exact same time, which all backers will also receive for free.  This is just something I was thinking about, and usually any extra money I get from crowdfunding I tend to put towards the many many MANY many other comics I have fully written and ready to make.</p>
<p>If we reach $30,000, we can have Inevitably Doomed printed and shipped to every backer who donated at least $5.  However, all backers of any amount will get a digital copy (PDF and raw image files in a nice handy zip file!).</p>

Written by the first ever gray/mauve ace-demisexual panfluid gendernormative writers of color in comics, Ran’Deesha Diaz and Raymond Porse are ushering in a new era of Comic Liberty on par with classic works such as Princess Highground and Tails Gets Trolled.  These creators are hoping to bring Some Wonderful Creations (or SWC for short) to the world of comics.
 

Funding
Primarily to the artist.  It's $3000 total for the raw lines, then another $3000 for coloring, so it's $6000 total to be able to make this comic in its entirety, so the goal is $7000 to cover the Indiegogo fees and any extra emergency costs.  Ray and I won't be receiving this money, we'll simply be using it to fund the art.  If we get more than that we'll be splitting it with the artist(s).
Stretch goals
If we reach $9,000 I can potentially have Literally #2 (the next issue of our first comic) made at the exact same time, which all backers will also receive for free.  This is just something I was thinking about, and usually any extra money I get from crowdfunding I tend to put towards the many many MANY many other comics I have fully written and ready to make.
If we reach $30,000, we can have Inevitably Doomed printed and shipped to every backer who donated at least $5.  However, all backers of any amount will get a digital copy (PDF and raw image files in a nice handy zip file!).",2.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h1>SUPERCREW: Their Journey Begins</h1>
<h2><em>Their Story:</em></h2>
<p>In a world gone mad, where children intimidate other children into submission, where bullies take over playgrounds at recess and residential streets after school, how are parents supposed to protect their children? How are children supposed to protect themselves?</p>
<p>Radio Baxter, an L.A. D.J. with KJDT, has promised to mentor and watch out for three boys from local families. He wants to give them the guidance, be a role model, and protect them in ways that he never was while growing up in foster homes. It wasn’t easy, but he made it. His crew — Man-E, B-Brain, and Whoosh — are doing well. They excel in school, at sports, and B-Brain’s got a talent for music that Radio envies. Yeah, all is going well until he takes them on a camping trip. First there’s an Earthquake, then they’re all exposed to Alien tech, now — well, now they’ve all got superpowers. How do you protect and give guidance to three boys with special abilities?</p>
<p>To make it worse there’s a crazy man, Horace Morgan, calling himself The Ace of Horror, who was also exposed to the Alien tech. He knows that Radio and his crew, The SuperCrew, are the only ones that can stop his diabolical plan and he’ll do everything in his power to destroy them.</p>

<h2>Tomaso Baldassarra &amp; Dario Cavada:</h2>
<p>Tommy &amp; Dario's adventure began in 2010, when Tomaso Baldassarra, an Illustrator who had already produced a series of children’s books, and Dario Cavada, an engineer with the soul of a musician, first met. The <a class=""ui-link"" href=""http://www.merlino-dreamlab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Merlino Dreamlab"">Merlino DreamLab</a> brand was born from this meeting with the intention of creating something innovative using new technologies in order to make Tommy's “paper” books interactive and more engaging. They dove into this adventure without worrying about what could go wrong. Their first project was done using Adobe Flash. This was a joint project in association with the “Azienda per il Turismo della Val di Fiemme” (The Fiemme Valley Tourism Association). They had their first “eureka” moment with the advent of the iPad which was described as almost ""magical"" by Steve Jobs. It was love at first sight! The iPad could help bring their dream of interactivity and ease of use to reality and to their audience!</p>
<p>Tommy’s creativity and talent along with Dario’s engineering and musical abilities allowed their ideas to meld seamlessly. After seeing the first series of applications for interactive books, such as ""Alice for iPad,” they started developing their first app. After six months of love and labor they finished their app. What a wonderful moment! What a great feeling!</p>
<h2><strong>John Joseph Andrucci:</strong></h2>
<p>John started in film and Television many years ago. He worked for an educational film distributor who also produced After School Specials (yes, he's a little bit of TV history). He then went on to work for an animation company that produced Saturday morning cartoons. This was his dream when he was a little kid and he got to live it. He remembers sitting in front of the television saying, “I’m going to do that.” John wanted to create the shows; to entertain. He started writing - specifically he started ghost writing. He took other people’s ideas and characters and plots and wrote their stories. He did this for many years. Now, he wants to bring his stories, his creations to you. He wants to entertain you. He hopes you enjoy the SUPERCREW: Their Journey Begins, and looks forward to bringing you more enjoyment as you get to know him and his characters.</p>

Our Story:

Merlino Dreamlab -
Tomaso Baldassarra & Dario Cavada:
Tommy & Dario's adventure began in 2010, when Tomaso Baldassarra, an Illustrator who had already produced a series of children’s books, and Dario Cavada, an engineer with the soul of a musician, first met. The Merlino DreamLab brand was born from this meeting with the intention of creating something innovative using new technologies in order to make Tommy's “paper” books interactive and more engaging. They dove into this adventure without worrying about what could go wrong. Their first project was done using Adobe Flash. This was a joint project in association with the “Azienda per il Turismo della Val di Fiemme” (The Fiemme Valley Tourism Association). They had their first “eureka” moment with the advent of the iPad which was described as almost ""magical"" by Steve Jobs. It was love at first sight! The iPad could help bring their dream of interactivity and ease of use to reality and to their audience!
Tommy’s creativity and talent along with Dario’s engineering and musical abilities allowed their ideas to meld seamlessly. After seeing the first series of applications for interactive books, such as ""Alice for iPad,” they started developing their first app. After six months of love and labor they finished their app. What a wonderful moment! What a great feeling!
John Joseph Andrucci:
John started in film and Television many years ago. He worked for an educational film distributor who also produced After School Specials (yes, he's a little bit of TV history). He then went on to work for an animation company that produced Saturday morning cartoons. This was his dream when he was a little kid and he got to live it. He remembers sitting in front of the television saying, “I’m going to do that.” John wanted to create the shows; to entertain. He started writing - specifically he started ghost writing. He took other people’s ideas and characters and plots and wrote their stories. He did this for many years. Now, he wants to bring his stories, his creations to you. He wants to entertain you. He hopes you enjoy the SUPERCREW: Their Journey Begins, and looks forward to bringing you more enjoyment as you get to know him and his characters.
KJDT Entertainment:
KJDT was born from the need of two creative entities and the ability of each to help the other. Dario & Tommy needed an English Editor to assist with the Italian translation of their property, ELISEO & THE LEGENDS OF THE FIEMME VALLEY. John needed illustrations for the SUPERCREW. As the months past their working relationship grew stronger, other projects were brought into the arrangement, more illustrations were drawn, more stories shared. They became a super-crew of their own. KJDT, Radio's radio station call letters, an acronym of John, Dario and Tommy's initials became the call letters for their new company. A company that reaches across the Atlantic and hopes to reach children around the world to deliver the anti-bullying message in the SUPERCREW.

<p>""The adventure"" is a comic book, revealing the romantic experiences of Jack McInlove, who is in love with Olivia and wants to invite her to date and share his feelings for her. But Jack has a problem. He doesn`t know how to do it and often his attempts end in a comic way.</p>
<p>Here comes Uncle Phil, who tries to help Jack. He considers himself a specialist in love and is resolved to make Olivia become Mrs. McInlove. Unfortunately Uncle Phil’s advice is often thoughtless and Jack goes through the entire range of romantic misadventures, as his ultimate goal is to capture the heart of Olivia. Jack and Olivia will go through situations that will teach them the truth about love, which they have not understood before. </p>
<p><img alt=""info2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1288.photobucket.com/albums/b485/kivpicture/symb.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""symb""/></p>
<p>Jack represents many of today's men, who don`t  know how exactly to approach the woman they like and to make their declaration of love. Olivia symbolizes women, who also have feelings for a man, but because of objective or subjective reasons prefer to play with their suitor and test his time after time  before sharing their feelings and pronounce the covenant ""I like you too"". Uncle Phil reflects the advice we get from our friends or relatives, which sometimes are not absolutely relevant and it so happens that we are not helping much.</p>

<p>We will use the characters of Jack and Olivia at diverse situations to show how people (in their love adventures) look like from aside. Therefore we would like to illustrate the right and wrong ways to act and react in the relationship with our soulmate.</p>
<p> The comic book will be 48 black and white pages (english language). The expenses on artwork, design, press-preparation, printing and other administrative fees regarding the book’s publishing will be about $2800.</p>

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>Here we go again! After an AMAZING FIRST EVER campaign for Rubicon Comics last year AND a successful Kickstarter campaign for Issue #2 we are bringing you <strong>ISSUE #2 HERE ON INDIEGOGO</strong> as a<strong> second chance campaign</strong>!</p>
<p>With this series, I am fusing a unique blend of Lovecraftian Horror and the superhero genre, something I call the Lovecraftian Dark Heroverse. A world filled with the insanity, fear, and terror of the Lovecraft Mythos but also a world were heroes with these eldritch powers can exist as well. Think Silver Surfer meets Cthulhu meets Constantine!</p> <p>The talented Alper Geçgel is returning for the page art (pencils and inks) and Sercan Sarikaya on colors. We have a slew of amazing cover artists including Jay Espin, Vic King, Deti, and the talented and very experienced Mark McKenna!</p> <p>Last we left Isidora, she had managed to free herself from the King in Yellow and is on Earth doling out her own brand of justice but also seeking to protect the innocent, something she was unable to do as the King in Yellow's Herald. </p>
<p>During a battle with some of Shub Niggurath's acolytes, a human detective, Constance Hawkberk, managed to grab a hold of the Yellow Sign and nearly died. Trying to protect her and battle the acolytes, Isidora was in a precarious situation. That is until the Great Old One, Nyarlathothep showed up to Isidora's shock!</p>

<p></p>
<p>I
was born and raised in the small town of Kazan, Russia. I did not have many
opportunities to travel while growing up, but that never stopped me from
admiring the globetrotting lifestyle. I wanted to travel to different
countries, meet new people, and understand diverse cultures and ways of life. </p>
<p>My
desire to see the world prompted me to accept a position with MARS, Inc. in
which international travel was actually part of the job description! I’ve
explored nearly half of the world since then, but I can never get enough of one
place in particular – Thailand! </p>
<p>Having
an apartment in Thailand will allow me to enjoy the most beautiful sunsets on
Earth, hear and feel the ocean, taste exotic fruits, and be as close to nature
as possible!</p>
<p>I know I’m not alone in my love of Thailand,
and that’s why I want to share it with you.</p>
<p>I’ve
selected a beautiful, brand new, and fully furnished apartment in Pattaya,
Thailand within easy walking distance to the beach. But before I move in, YOU
can enjoy a stay in the apartment. For just $50 a day, you’ll enjoy the
comforts of home and also fund the apartment’s purchase. </p>

This is the perfect opportunity to make sure
your Thailand vacation is not only affordable, but also luxurious. Why stay at

</div></div>","Short Summary 

I
was born and raised in the small town of Kazan, Russia. I did not have many
opportunities to travel while growing up, but that never stopped me from
admiring the globetrotting lifestyle. I wanted to travel to different
countries, meet new people, and understand diverse cultures and ways of life. 
My
desire to see the world prompted me to accept a position with MARS, Inc. in
which international travel was actually part of the job description! I’ve
explored nearly half of the world since then, but I can never get enough of one
place in particular – Thailand! 
Having
an apartment in Thailand will allow me to enjoy the most beautiful sunsets on
Earth, hear and feel the ocean, taste exotic fruits, and be as close to nature
as possible!
I know I’m not alone in my love of Thailand,
and that’s why I want to share it with you.
I’ve
selected a beautiful, brand new, and fully furnished apartment in Pattaya,
Thailand within easy walking distance to the beach. But before I move in, YOU
can enjoy a stay in the apartment. For just $50 a day, you’ll enjoy the
comforts of home and also fund the apartment’s purchase. 

This is the perfect opportunity to make sure
your Thailand vacation is not only affordable, but also luxurious. Why stay at
an overpriced hotel when you can relax in a private apartment? This is a
limited time offer, as the apartment will only be available to contributors and
stays can only be booked for the first three years after the apartment’s purchase .What We Need & What You Get
 
$54,000 is needed ($51K property +$3K legal and light refurbishment) to buy this apartment: 
http://www.rightmove.co.uk/overseas-property/property-34514191.html
Perks are unique and unbeatable: 
I won’t be living in the apartment for the first 3 years, so until then it is completely yours to enjoy. You are welcome to make yourself at home in this beautiful apartment for the number of days proportional to your contribution value! (See perks section for details.)
$54,000 (total apartment cost) / 360 (rounded number of days in a year) / 3 (number of years) = $50 cost per day, which is way cheaper than a hotel. 
An online booking tool will show the availability of the apartment and the days already booked by other contributors. Access to the booking tool will be based on the order of contribution.
You can choose any day(s) within the 3 years following my purchase of the apartment, or you can exchange days with other contributors. During these first 3 years, the apartment will remain available only to contributors and will not be otherwise rented. If campaign brings more, then 3 years will be extended to allow all contributors visit & enjoy.
By donating just $100, you’ll get to enjoy 2 days in the apartment you’ve helped me buy!

  The Impact 

I’m confident this project will be a success based on my recent experience purchasing an apartment in Moscow for my family, managing its refurbishment, and moving in within 2 months!
Moreover, given my work as a professional project manager, I believe this can be done quite easily if given sufficient funding.
By providing affordable yet comfortable lodging, it’s my hope that more people can experience the beauty of the country I’ve come to love so much. 


Risks & Challenges
 
There
is always the possibility that not enough funds will be raised in order to
purchase the apartment. The backup plan for this scenario is as follows:
· 
Insufficient funding will enable me to look for
another “value for money” apartment, and the conditions for living in it will
remain the same. 
· 
If little funding is received and I am not able to buy
anything, you’ll get your money back still getting personal “Thank you” from
myself :)

It’s up to you.</p>
<p>(For the record, I'll keep my daily comic strip, ""Minimum Security,"" still going either way for now).<br/><br/>“Code Green” is, as far as I know, the only regular editorial cartoon in the U.S. devoted exclusively to the environmental crisis. You can see examples in the video above. During the three years I’ve been drawing it, I’ve covered topics like deforestation, heavy metal pollution, the Keystone XL tarsands oil pipeline, species extinction, the BP oil spill, and (of course) global warming.<br/><br/>The cartoons have been reprinted all over the world, from Bangladesh to Saudi Arabia, Canada to Australia. Protesters at demonstrations have printed them on signs. Organizers put them on leaflets and in their newsletters. Readers share them on blogs. They’ve run in my local daily paper, and even better, in several papers put out by Occupy movement groups. Last year, I won first prize in the category of editorial cartooning from the Society of Professional Journalists, and this year I won the RFK Journalism Award for editorial cartoons that contribute to human rights and social justice. <br/><br/>There’s a problem though. We all know print media has crashed. Editorial cartooning, as a profession, has crashed along with it. Three and a half years ago I was laid off from the paper where I worked (it later folded). So I went freelance. But print media no longer pays very much for content. Websites often refuse to pay anything at all. Consequently, it turns out I’m unable to make a living this way (defined as: very basic food, shelter, health care, and transportation). This is not unusual for cartoonists these days. Many excellent cartoonists have had to quit and find other kinds of work. I may be next.<br/><br/>So I’m turning to my readers to see if they want to support “Code Green.” I know many of you are also struggling in this crap economy, so I almost don’t even want to ask. But lately, when I’ve told people that I’m thinking of no longer drawing it, some have responded with dismay. Each day, people write to me about how much they like my cartoons (which I very much appreciate). I don’t think it’s simply politeness – I believe that these cartoons do connect with a section of people who are deeply concerned with the fate of our planet. The cartoons make them feel less alone, cheer them on, encourage them to fight back against the ecocidal system. This, precisely, is what I draw them for. I hate that I have to make money with them too, but this is the unfortunate reality of living under capitalism (which I’m also trying to do something about, but that’s another topic).<br/><br/>So it comes down to this: If readers want “Code Green” to keep coming, I’m willing to do it. But if these cartoons don’t contribute more to my livelihood, I can’t spend the time required to create them – which is considerable (punch lines don’t come easy for me, and there’s a lot of research involved). For $9000, I’ll keep them coming for another year. After campaign fees, taxes and postage, plus payment for Root Robin (who generously offered the use of the delightful song in the video for free if I don't reach my goal -- this is an all-or-nothing deal; if the total goal isn't reached, your pledge is refunded), this comes out to less than $100 per weekly cartoon. That's a very modest amount, especially compared to what editorial cartoonists used to make. I’m not looking to get rich – simply to get by doing work that I believe has some social value.<br/><br/>I’ll post and share this in a few places, but I hate asking for money. So there will be no email campaigns, no spamming, no begging. I won't send more than one email to people about this (except updates for those who contribute). If you like ""Code Green"" and want to support it and spread the word to others, you will. If not, that’s okay too.

<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>The first novel in the Dawn of Unity series:
 Genesis has already been published and <b>over 100 copies</b> have been sold. 
Now I want to take it and transform it into a series of Comic Books. I 
have already split the novel up into Arcs, as milestones for myself to 
get parts complete. This Campaign is only for the <b>First Arc</b>.</p>
<p>The
 comic will serve to give the reader a different perspective from what 
is written in the novel. In other words, the comic will <b>NOT </b>be 
told exactly like the novel. Though the main events will be the same, I 
strive to give you a new way of looking at the story itself.</p>
<p>As 
said above, you can read what has been done so far on the website for 
free. But think of that version as the rough draft. The version that 
will be printed will have touched up pages, and in some cases, c<b>ompletely redone</b> pages. There will also be <b>extra </b>artwork included that you will not find online. <b>PLUS </b>all the pages in the comic books will be printed in <b>FULL </b>color.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162778/files/20131029200714-GenesisST_1_8n9.jpg?1383102434"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>REWARDS</h1>
<p>We all like to know what we are getting! For this campaign there are TWO main special rewards that I am offering:</p>
<p>The first is a special Limited Edition version of Issue 1 that has a <b>SKETCH COVER! </b>This means that you get an original one of a kind piece of artwork on the cover! You can choose <b>ANY </b>Astria Legends character that you want. That character will even leave their <b>own signature</b> on the picture! Now how many of you can say you got your favorite character's autograph?</p>
<p>The second is the <b>BIG EXCLUSIVE REWARD</b>. In the First Arc, there is an <b>item </b>that is introduced that is very important to one of the characters. In this reward, <b>YOU </b>will receive a <b>genuine replica of that item</b>! The item will be signed and numbered. You will also receive <b>exclusive art and information</b> on the item's use as well as the character it belongs to!</p>
<p>Also, if we <b>EXCEED </b>our goal and break $1000, I am going to add a 11x17 mini poster print of brand new, never before seen art to <b>ALL </b>backers who pledged $20 and up! To backers below $20, they will get a <b>desktop</b> <b>wallpaper </b>of the same artwork!</p>
<p>
</p>
<h1>Goals and Dreams</h1>
<p>I 
have been working on the Christian Fantasy world of Astria Legends for 
over ten years. I desire to empower people with the knowledge that they 
can make a difference both in their own lives and in the lives of 
others. I want to teach them that every decision that they make has the 
power to affect those they will never come in contact with and can last 
lifetimes. The Dawn of Unity Series is a fantasy, something that young 
adults as well as adults can get into, but it is also a tool. A tool 
that shows that no matter how old you are, what you have done, what you 
have been through, your background, race, how you were brought up or 
what others have said about you, that it is never too late to make a 
change.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I hope that by the pictures you see that I am putting out my 
very best artwork into this comic to make it a beautiful and quality 
product.</p>
<p>Should this campaign be a success I want to continue until
 the entire novel is transformed into comic form. Then I want to 
continue the entire Dawn of Unity series in comic books until the saga 
is complete!</p>

<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p>The Risks and challenges of this project is having the time to finish it according to the deadline. I feel that I have given myself ample time to complete the arc including buffer just encase ""life"" happens. <br/><br/>Also there is the time it will take for the books to be printed. Depending on how long the lead time is, books may not be sent out on time. This is outside of my control but I will keep all backers updated on this situation should it come up.</p>

those who dwell in Astria Galaxy... and the journey has only just begun!

Exalted One, they are the only protection between the galaxy and Sin. 
Some will overcome, while some give in. Their choices effect the overall
 UNITY; a delicate creature whose influence could destroy the galaxy. It
 is then that the biggest lessons are learned...

About This Project
The first novel in the Dawn of Unity series:
 Genesis has already been published and over 100 copies have been sold. 
Now I want to take it and transform it into a series of Comic Books. I 
have already split the novel up into Arcs, as milestones for myself to 
get parts complete. This Campaign is only for the First Arc.
The
 comic will serve to give the reader a different perspective from what 
is written in the novel. In other words, the comic will NOT be 
told exactly like the novel. Though the main events will be the same, I 
strive to give you a new way of looking at the story itself.
As 
said above, you can read what has been done so far on the website for 
free. But think of that version as the rough draft. The version that 
will be printed will have touched up pages, and in some cases, completely redone pages. There will also be extra artwork included that you will not find online. PLUS all the pages in the comic books will be printed in FULL color.






REWARDS
We all like to know what we are getting! For this campaign there are TWO main special rewards that I am offering:
The first is a special Limited Edition version of Issue 1 that has a SKETCH COVER! This means that you get an original one of a kind piece of artwork on the cover! You can choose ANY Astria Legends character that you want. That character will even leave their own signature on the picture! Now how many of you can say you got your favorite character's autograph?
The second is the BIG EXCLUSIVE REWARD. In the First Arc, there is an item that is introduced that is very important to one of the characters. In this reward, YOU will receive a genuine replica of that item! The item will be signed and numbered. You will also receive exclusive art and information on the item's use as well as the character it belongs to!
Also, if we EXCEED our goal and break $1000, I am going to add a 11x17 mini poster print of brand new, never before seen art to ALL backers who pledged $20 and up! To backers below $20, they will get a desktop wallpaper of the same artwork!


Goals and Dreams
I 
have been working on the Christian Fantasy world of Astria Legends for 
over ten years. I desire to empower people with the knowledge that they 
can make a difference both in their own lives and in the lives of 
others. I want to teach them that every decision that they make has the 
power to affect those they will never come in contact with and can last 
lifetimes. The Dawn of Unity Series is a fantasy, something that young 
adults as well as adults can get into, but it is also a tool. A tool 
that shows that no matter how old you are, what you have done, what you 
have been through, your background, race, how you were brought up or 
what others have said about you, that it is never too late to make a 
change.


I hope that by the pictures you see that I am putting out my 
very best artwork into this comic to make it a beautiful and quality 
product.
Should this campaign be a success I want to continue until
 the entire novel is transformed into comic form. Then I want to 
continue the entire Dawn of Unity series in comic books until the saga 
is complete!


Risks and Challenges
The Risks and challenges of this project is having the time to finish it according to the deadline. I feel that I have given myself ample time to complete the arc including buffer just encase ""life"" happens. Also there is the time it will take for the books to be printed. Depending on how long the lead time is, books may not be sent out on time. This is outside of my control but I will keep all backers updated on this situation should it come up.



Dream and Believe 
Over ten years in the making, such a long time
 spent on a dream. It has been a journey, both for me as well as all 
those who dwell in Astria Galaxy... and the journey has only just begun!
 
Help me make it possible! If you can't contribute, that's 
perfectly ok, I only ask that you pray and spread the word to whomever 
you can. Every little bit counts.",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

techniques and mechanisms required to complete
the project are dominated, beginning with the already finished draws and the
amount of 750 sketches able to be included in the book,
just like the design and print processes. The unique challenging variable is
the amount of pages that will be in the book, depending on the share and
stretch goals, in a range between 70 to up 300 pages. The deadline of one month is perfect for it´s initial size, but if the book grows bigger more time can be necessary (maybe one month more for a 300 pages book).<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> This is not a problem at all.</span></p>

The Share Goals section will show you that we reward with new poses and
products each share goal achieved!


   The
first funding goal of 1,8 thousand will guarantee the existence of the book!
The consecutives goals will increase the number of draws and types of categories.
With 7,4 thousand collected, a making of video of the book will be created and
all backers will own it! With 15,5 thousand collected a software version of this
book will be created! Go to the Upgrades section
to see the benefits achieved with the stretch and share goals.
   This
campaign is fixed funding, if the amount of 1,8 thousand is not collected your
money will be refunded and the project won´t exist.
   You are the agent of the success and patron of this dream. Please help this initiative and be a co-patron of this innovative project! Andre Modesto, the project´s creator, is a designer and 3d artist that have being working for the TV industry in the last 5 years, creating animations and visual effects for millions of TV viewers (see the Meet the Creator section in the end of the project).
   You
will get incredible perks of this project if you contribute! Go to the Perk
section to see what you get!!!










   The funds raised in this campaign will help
finish the book content, the print and the shipping. The value of 1,8k is the
minimum needed to do so. The extra money raised will stretch our goals bringing
new pages to the book, the opportunity to better the quality of the print and
to create extra products to the backers, like the making of video and the
software version of the book.
   The money contribution is important, but
share the project is also important to us! Visibility is a main question in a
well succeeded project, and our sharing goals will bring to you extra HQ Pose
Book pages and new products, like the HQ Sexy Poses and HQ Heroes Sketches
book!
   Let´s create the success of this project,
share this idea and contribute!






   In the day of your contribution you´ll get
a pdf demo version of the book with 10 poses! Even if the project wouldn´t get
the minimum funding goal, we show our gratitude with our contributors giving
this short demo!
   In the project´s funding day, even if the
campaign still not ended, you´ll get a pdf demo version of the book with 25
poses!
   After the end of the campaign, we need one
to two months to finish the book content (depending on the final number of
pages). After that, two weeks for print the books plus the shipping time (this shipping time depends on the country send).





The amount of money raised in this campaign represents
the quality and number of products available. 
The initial goal will bring to us the existence of HQ Poses Book with 70
pose Pages! Our stretch goals will increase the number of pages, will upgrade
the quality of the book, like be hardcover or have the Learning Chapters, and
new elements like the making of video and a software version of the book! If we
can´t raise the minimum of 1,8k the project won´t exist and you´ll receive your
money back.











It´s crucial for us the project sharing
because the success depends on how much people know it. The sharing goals stimulate
the social network sharing giving upgrades to the HQ Poses Book and bring new products for the contributors! Wallpapers, HQ Sexy Poses Book and HQ
Heroes Sketches Book are ready waiting your share!




   Sharing this project in the social networks or stretching our goals will increase the quality and types of perks availables for you! Help us to collect 1,8k to make real the HQ Poses Book!
   There are three ways to grow the page count of the HQ Poses Book, by the stretch goals, the sharing goals and by the perks Emperor and Divine! Colorful pages, big format book and hardcover are upgrades achieved by the stretching goals!
   1k sharing grants you 4 incredible wallpapers of the project! With 2,5k sharing you unlock the pdf copy of HQ Sexy Poses mini-book! 5k sharing grows 5 pages of this book. 7k sharing unlocks the HQ Heroes Sketches (this mini-book brings you draws of originals heroes and villains of HQ books)!
   Get an incredible making of video of this project if we achieve the 7,4k stretch goal, with 15,5k a software version of the HQ Poses Book for ""Grand Patron"" backers or up, with features like Quick Draw Search and Print Pose!



   Contribute with our project and get
incredible perks. See below what you get!





All
techniques and mechanisms required to complete
the project are dominated, beginning with the already finished draws and the
amount of 750 sketches able to be included in the book,
just like the design and print processes. The unique challenging variable is
the amount of pages that will be in the book, depending on the share and
stretch goals, in a range between 70 to up 300 pages. The deadline of one month is perfect for it´s initial size, but if the book grows bigger more time can be necessary (maybe one month more for a 300 pages book). This is not a problem at all.

<p>Il progetto <strong>Vintagerotika - Evilsex </strong>di <strong>Annexia</strong> ripropone i generi e i personaggi più rappresentativi delle principali testate erotiche a fumetti dei pocket sexy vintage italiani, testate principalmente prodotte dagli editori Renzo Barbieri e Giorgio Cavedon dagli anni Sessanta in poi, ben radicate nella memoria collettiva italiana, con nuove brevi storie di famosi autori contemporanei. Un imperdibile appuntamento con il fumetto erotico d'autore per dare nuova vita e dignità a un genere considerato da sempre di serie B e snobbato dalla critica, ma pubblicato in tutta Europa per decenni. Ogni albo della rosa dei personaggi proposti conterrà anche un breve saggio critico e la cronologia della testata. </p>
<p>I personaggi della prima fase del progetto, denominata EvilSex sono le antieroine dell’horror-sexy made in Italy: <strong>Zora la vampira, Sukia, Cimiteria, Ulula, Lucifera, Belzeba e Jacula.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vintagerotika - Evilsex </strong>by<strong> Annexia </strong>calls out again the most representative genres and characters  of the main erotic comic books and Italian's sexy vintage pocket books. These were mainly produced by publishers Renzo Barbieri and Giorgio Cavedon as from the 70's onwards, deeply rooted in the Italian collective memory, including with new short stories by famous contemporary authors. An unmissable rendezvous with auter erotic comics to give new life and dignity to a genre that always rated a B serie genre  and snubbed by the critics, though published all over Europe for decades. Every book of the chosen characters shortlist will also feature a brief critical essay and the chronology of the sheet. </p>
<p>The early phase characters, called Evilsex, are the anti-heroines of the horror-sexy genre made in italy: <strong>Zora la vampira (the she-vampire), Sukia, Cimiteria, Ulula, Lucifera, Belzeba and Jacula.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le projet<strong> Vintagerotika - Evilsex</strong> de<strong> Annexia </strong>vous propose de faire revivre les genres et les personnages plus significatifs des principales Bandes-Dessinées érotiques des éditions pocket sexy vintage italiennes. Ces publications étaient produites principalement par les éditeurs Renzo Barbieri et Giorgio Cavedon à partir des années '60, et restent bien ancrées dans la mémoire collective italienne. Le projet Vintagerotika ""Pop-Hard d'auteur"" de Annexia vous les repropose, donc, grâce à des histoires originales et inédites, écrites par d'affirmés auteurs contemporains. Un rendez-vous immancable avec la Bande-Dessinée érotique d'auteur, pour donner une nouvelle lymphe à un genre considéré de série B e snobé par la critique, bien que publié partout en Europe. Chaque album (petit format) dédié à un des personnages fournira en outre un bref essai critique, ainsi que la chronologie des publications. </p>
<p>Les personnages de la première phase du projet nommé EvilSex sont les anti-héroïnes de l'Horror-Sexy Made in Italy: <strong>Zora la vampire (Zara la vampire), Sukia, Cimitieria, Ulula, Lucifera, Belzeba, Jacula.</strong></p>

Femmine diaboliche abitavano i pensieri proibiti degli uomini e delle donne più smaliziate e golose, i tetri anfratti delle case e i salotti dei barbieri. I loro nomi sono scolpiti sulle polverose lapidi della memoria: vampire senza vergogna, amanti morte, figlie del diavolo, streghe oscene e meretrici d'oltretomba stanno per risvegliarsi ed esaudire le vostre voglie più torbide e peccaminose. Solo la vostra insaziabile lussuria, il vostro perfetto feticismo potranno resuscitarle dall'oblio nel quale sono cadute, in un sonno profondo, avvolto dalle nebbie dell'abisso infernale. Quale incantesimo potrà risvegliarne le dolci, fredde membra? Quale desiderio occulto saprà riportarle in vita?"".
 

ULULA BY EMANUELE TAGLIETTI
 
""Once upon a time, many many years ago, there was an obscure realm populating dark corners all over Europe. Diabolic female creature dwelled men's thoughts and savvy and greedy women's minds, wormed their way into the gloomy clefts of homes, living rooms and barbershops. Their names are carved on the dusty tombstones of memory: shameless vampires, dead lovers, devil's daughters, lewd witches and afterlife whores are about to reawaken to please your darkest and sinful cravings. Only your insatiable luxury, your perfect fetishism, will be able to revive them from the oblivion where they fell, in a deep sleep, shrouded in the fog of the infernal abyss. Which spell will reawaken their sweet cold limbs? Which occult desire could bring them back to life?"".
""Il était une fois, il y'a bien des années, un univers sombre dont les créatures maudites habitaient les recoins obscurs d'Europe. Femelles diaboliques hantaient les rêveries languissantes d'hommes vicieux et de femmes gourmandes, ainsi que les recoins lugubres des celliers, caves et salons de coiffure. Leurs noms sont gravés dans les poussiéreux sépulcres de la mémoire: amantes défuntes, filles du diable, vampires sans vergogne, obscènes sorcières e méretrices d'outre-tombe n'attendent que vous pour se réveiller et assouvir vos envies pécheresses. Seule votre insatiable luxure et votre impeccable fétichisme pourraient les sortir de la torpeur dans laquelle elles sont tombées, recouvertes des brumes de l'infernal abîme de l'oubli. Quel sortilège pourra redonner vie à leurs corps doux et froids? Quel occulte désir saura les éveiller?"".
 

 
Il progetto Vintagerotika - Evilsex di Annexia ripropone i generi e i personaggi più rappresentativi delle principali testate erotiche a fumetti dei pocket sexy vintage italiani, testate principalmente prodotte dagli editori Renzo Barbieri e Giorgio Cavedon dagli anni Sessanta in poi, ben radicate nella memoria collettiva italiana, con nuove brevi storie di famosi autori contemporanei. Un imperdibile appuntamento con il fumetto erotico d'autore per dare nuova vita e dignità a un genere considerato da sempre di serie B e snobbato dalla critica, ma pubblicato in tutta Europa per decenni. Ogni albo della rosa dei personaggi proposti conterrà anche un breve saggio critico e la cronologia della testata. 
I personaggi della prima fase del progetto, denominata EvilSex sono le antieroine dell’horror-sexy made in Italy: Zora la vampira, Sukia, Cimiteria, Ulula, Lucifera, Belzeba e Jacula.
 
Vintagerotika - Evilsex by Annexia calls out again the most representative genres and characters  of the main erotic comic books and Italian's sexy vintage pocket books. These were mainly produced by publishers Renzo Barbieri and Giorgio Cavedon as from the 70's onwards, deeply rooted in the Italian collective memory, including with new short stories by famous contemporary authors. An unmissable rendezvous with auter erotic comics to give new life and dignity to a genre that always rated a B serie genre  and snubbed by the critics, though published all over Europe for decades. Every book of the chosen characters shortlist will also feature a brief critical essay and the chronology of the sheet. 
The early phase characters, called Evilsex, are the anti-heroines of the horror-sexy genre made in italy: Zora la vampira (the she-vampire), Sukia, Cimiteria, Ulula, Lucifera, Belzeba and Jacula.
 
Le projet Vintagerotika - Evilsex de Annexia vous propose de faire revivre les genres et les personnages plus significatifs des principales Bandes-Dessinées érotiques des éditions pocket sexy vintage italiennes. Ces publications étaient produites principalement par les éditeurs Renzo Barbieri et Giorgio Cavedon à partir des années '60, et restent bien ancrées dans la mémoire collective italienne. Le projet Vintagerotika ""Pop-Hard d'auteur"" de Annexia vous les repropose, donc, grâce à des histoires originales et inédites, écrites par d'affirmés auteurs contemporains. Un rendez-vous immancable avec la Bande-Dessinée érotique d'auteur, pour donner une nouvelle lymphe à un genre considéré de série B e snobé par la critique, bien que publié partout en Europe. Chaque album (petit format) dédié à un des personnages fournira en outre un bref essai critique, ainsi que la chronologie des publications. 
Les personnages de la première phase du projet nommé EvilSex sont les anti-héroïnes de l'Horror-Sexy Made in Italy: Zora la vampire (Zara la vampire), Sukia, Cimitieria, Ulula, Lucifera, Belzeba, Jacula.
​​

 
Gli autori coinvolti sono nomi noti al pubblico dei lettori di fumetto. Copertine, storie e disegni sapranno soddisfare il gusto delgli appassionati in modo molto eterogeneo, senza però tradire l’essenza vintage del progetto e, soprattutto, il carattere stesso dei personaggi.​ 
The involved authors are well known to the comic readers audience. Covers, stories and drawings will appeal across the spectrum of fans in a pick and mix way, without betraying the vintage essence of the project and, above all, the personality of the characters.
Les Bandes-Dessinées seront écrites par des auteurs affirmés et déjà connus du public. Couvertures, histoires et dessins sauront satisfaire le goût des passionnés du genre de façon hétérogène sans pour autant trahir l'esprit vintage du projet, et encore moins le caractère spécifique des personnages orignaux. 
 
​
 
In caso di superamento del GOAL del crowdfunding, prima dello scadere dei due mesi previsti, verrà aggiunto un nuovo albo GRATIS, un nuovo personaggio per ogni piccolo nuovo obbiettivo di 1.500 €, il cui team creativo verrà svelato di volta in volta, e saranno, in ordine di apparizione: Naga la maga e Yra la vampira. Un regalo per tutti coloro che, con il loro contributo, hanno creduto nel progetto.​​​
Upon successful completion of the GOAL before expiration of 2 months, a new free book will be added, a new character for every next intermediate goal of 1500 eur, whose creative team will be disclosed each time. These new characters will be in order of appearance:  Naga la maga (the witch) and  Yra la vampira (the she-vampire). A present for all those that thanks to their contribution have believed in the project.
Au cas où le GOAL du Crowdfunding, serait rejoint avant le terme des deux mois prévus, un album gratuit sera ajouté. Pour chaque mini objectif de 1 500 € en plus du but, un nouveau personnage sera proposé. L'équipe créative de ce numéro extra sera révélée sur le moment. Par ordre de parution: Naga la maga (la sorcière), Yra la vampira (la Vampire). Un cadeau est prévu pour tous ceux qui auront cru et contribué à la réalisation de ce projet.

<p>What if you could talk to buildings, and the buildings talked back? What if Heaven was humanity's rightful home, and only you could tear down its walls?</p>
<p>These are the questions that drive Shaw Serling, the young heroine of my graphic novel, <em>Hell's Treasure</em>. But the biggest question of all is this: Will you help bring <em>Hell's Treasure</em> to life? If the answer is yes, prepare to receive some awesome rewards.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87095/files/20130920185159-cover_with_logo_1.jpg?1379728319"" src="""" style=""width: 505.42px; height: 792px;""/></p>
<h1>Go, Team <em>Hell's Treasure</em>!</h1>
<p>Bring together one award-winning writer (that's me, Robert Jeschonek), one rising star artist (Megan Levens of <em>Somewhere in Between</em>) and one hard-hitting letterer (the man called Crank!), and you've got the perfect team to make <em>Hell's Treasure</em> an unforgettable book.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87097/files/20130920185413-Team_photo_2.jpg?1379728453"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Here's The Story</h1>
<p>I'm dying to share this project with the world. It's all about Shaw, a teenage girl who can communicate with architecture--everything from buildings to bridges--and make it do her bidding. </p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87102/files/20130920185738-shaw_falls_smaller.jpg?1379728658"" src="""" style=""width: 490px; height: 746px;""/></p>
<p>Her power can't save her parents from dying in a car crash...but maybe she can bring them back. A boy named Aaron, with powers of his own, takes her on a quest to seize the keys to Heaven.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87114/files/20130920190615-Aaron_face_1.jpg?1379729175"" src="""" style=""width: 178.13px; height: 205px;""/></p>
<p>Angels fight like hell to stop them. Only boy genius John Halcyon, an exile from Heaven, knows the secret behind their struggle: that Heaven is humanity's rightful home, and Shaw is destined to tear down the walls keeping out the human race.</p>

<h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p><em>Hell's Treasure </em>has almost come to life several times in the publishing world...but ""almost"" isn't good enough anymore. Publishers might be reluctant to take a chance on something this new and fresh, but <em>you</em> have the power to make this book a reality.</p>
<h1><b>Team <i>Hell's Treasure</i> Wants You!</b></h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>And if you join the <i>Hell's Treasure</i> team, you won't be disappointed. Megan is a fabulous artist, currently working on projects for several high profile publishers. Crank is a wizard with lettering and has got one hell of a resume (<em>Hack/Slack, Battle Pug, It Girl and the Atomics</em>).</p>
<p>As for me, I've written for DC Comics (most recently, ""Gotham Eye View"" in <em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em> #52). I've written over 100 books, e-books, and audiobooks, including official <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Doctor Who</em> fiction. My rock 'n' roll fantasy <em>My Favorite Band Does Not Exist</em> won the Forward National Literature Award and was named a Top 10 First Novel for Youth by prestigious <em>Booklist</em> magazine. Not to mention, I run my own publishing company, Pie Press. What all this means is that I know how to write a great graphic novel, and I know how to publish and ship it like a pro.</p>
<h1><b>Being in the Heart of the Action</b></h1>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""></h1>
<p>We're going to do this book right, because we know you wouldn't have it any other way. That means you'll get the full, finished graphic novel in your hot little hands in August 2014. It will take until then for Mighty Megan and Captivating Crank to pencil, ink, color, and letter all 145 pages of this epic tome!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87122/files/20130920191259-cast_reduced.jpg?1379729579"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But fear not! If you back Team <i>Hell's Treasure</i> at the $15 level or above, the time will fly, because we'll ship quarterly installments straight to your e-mail inbox. You'll get to watch the graphic novel take shape before your very eyes. </p>
<p>And if you pledge $20 or more, your quarterly installments will include bonus PDFs of all the latest pages in each stage of production: pencils, inks, and colors. So the time until the book's completion will keep you right in the heart of the action, watching as this project comes to life.</p>
<h1><b>Dough, Bread, Moola, Cold Hard Cash</b></h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>Shaw Serling communicates with buildings, but <em>you're</em> the one with the real power here. Because <i>Hell's Treasure</i> will only come to life with your backing. </p>
<p>Over half the original goal amount will go to pay Megan, a professional artist who does quality work. She depends on her art to put food on the table; if I don't pay her a decent rate per page, she literally can't afford to do the work. Crank will get a piece of the pie, too, for the same reason, and so will I. The rest of the proceeds will fund the production and shipping of the books and rewards.</p>
<p>You'll see the money right there on the pages, and in the awesome rewards. Remember, you get what you pay for.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87128/files/20130920191917-shaw.jpg?1379729957"" src="""" style=""width: 471.31px; height: 580px;""/></p>
<h1>Get Your Swag On! </h1>
<p>If you love rewards, you've come to the right place. Because yes, we're bringing the swag! Megan's already sharpening her pencils to whip up limited edition sketch cards, one-of-a-kind custom sketches, and holy-crap-is-that-ever-cool signed editions of the book tricked out with sketches on multiple pages. Not to mention the illustrated cameos and illustrated cameo speaking roles that will appear in every edition and copy of the graphic novel. And that's not all! We've also got t-shirts, bundles of e-books, stacks of paperbacks...even the full manuscript of the sequel, <em>Hell's Power. </em>Remember, all our rewards are exclusive to <em>Hell's Treasure</em> Kickstarter backers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/87135/files/20130920192115-Hell_s_Power_Page_One.jpg?1379730075"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1><b>Did Somebody Say Stretch?</b></h1>
<h1></h1>
<p>When it comes to stretch goals, we've got big plans. Any funding above our goal amount will go toward new <i>Hell's Treasure</i> projects for you to enjoy...but if we stretch far enough, our wish list will really kick into gear. We hope you'll unlock the whole list, which we'll reveal as the project raises more money. But we can tell you this much: the sequel's already been written, and it won't shut up about making it into print!</p>

<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p>We never know what curve balls life is going to throw at us. Just like Shaw in Hell's Treasure, anyone could face the biggest challenges at any time...and they could put a very big crimp in our best-laid plans. So if a member of Team Hell's Treasure meets up with an unexpected roll of the dice during the next year, it could alter our delivery schedule for the graphic novel and rewards. If that happens, we promise to do our best to come up with alternate arrangements to deliver the book and rewards to you in as timely a fashion as possible. And we promise to keep you in the loop throughout the process so you'll know exactly what to expect and when. Because you'll be a member of Team Hell's Treasure, and we take care of our own!</p></span></span></div>","The Walls Have Ears...and Voices, Too!
What if you could talk to buildings, and the buildings talked back? What if Heaven was humanity's rightful home, and only you could tear down its walls?
These are the questions that drive Shaw Serling, the young heroine of my graphic novel, Hell's Treasure. But the biggest question of all is this: Will you help bring Hell's Treasure to life? If the answer is yes, prepare to receive some awesome rewards.

Go, Team Hell's Treasure!
Bring together one award-winning writer (that's me, Robert Jeschonek), one rising star artist (Megan Levens of Somewhere in Between) and one hard-hitting letterer (the man called Crank!), and you've got the perfect team to make Hell's Treasure an unforgettable book.

Here's The Story
I'm dying to share this project with the world. It's all about Shaw, a teenage girl who can communicate with architecture--everything from buildings to bridges--and make it do her bidding. 

Her power can't save her parents from dying in a car crash...but maybe she can bring them back. A boy named Aaron, with powers of his own, takes her on a quest to seize the keys to Heaven.

Angels fight like hell to stop them. Only boy genius John Halcyon, an exile from Heaven, knows the secret behind their struggle: that Heaven is humanity's rightful home, and Shaw is destined to tear down the walls keeping out the human race.


Why Indiegogo?

Hell's Treasure has almost come to life several times in the publishing world...but ""almost"" isn't good enough anymore. Publishers might be reluctant to take a chance on something this new and fresh, but you have the power to make this book a reality.
Team Hell's Treasure Wants You!

And if you join the Hell's Treasure team, you won't be disappointed. Megan is a fabulous artist, currently working on projects for several high profile publishers. Crank is a wizard with lettering and has got one hell of a resume (Hack/Slack, Battle Pug, It Girl and the Atomics).
As for me, I've written for DC Comics (most recently, ""Gotham Eye View"" in Legends of the Dark Knight #52). I've written over 100 books, e-books, and audiobooks, including official Star Trek and Doctor Who fiction. My rock 'n' roll fantasy My Favorite Band Does Not Exist won the Forward National Literature Award and was named a Top 10 First Novel for Youth by prestigious Booklist magazine. Not to mention, I run my own publishing company, Pie Press. What all this means is that I know how to write a great graphic novel, and I know how to publish and ship it like a pro.
Being in the Heart of the Action

We're going to do this book right, because we know you wouldn't have it any other way. That means you'll get the full, finished graphic novel in your hot little hands in August 2014. It will take until then for Mighty Megan and Captivating Crank to pencil, ink, color, and letter all 145 pages of this epic tome!

But fear not! If you back Team Hell's Treasure at the $15 level or above, the time will fly, because we'll ship quarterly installments straight to your e-mail inbox. You'll get to watch the graphic novel take shape before your very eyes. 
And if you pledge $20 or more, your quarterly installments will include bonus PDFs of all the latest pages in each stage of production: pencils, inks, and colors. So the time until the book's completion will keep you right in the heart of the action, watching as this project comes to life.
Dough, Bread, Moola, Cold Hard Cash

Shaw Serling communicates with buildings, but you're the one with the real power here. Because Hell's Treasure will only come to life with your backing. 
Over half the original goal amount will go to pay Megan, a professional artist who does quality work. She depends on her art to put food on the table; if I don't pay her a decent rate per page, she literally can't afford to do the work. Crank will get a piece of the pie, too, for the same reason, and so will I. The rest of the proceeds will fund the production and shipping of the books and rewards.
You'll see the money right there on the pages, and in the awesome rewards. Remember, you get what you pay for.

Get Your Swag On! 
If you love rewards, you've come to the right place. Because yes, we're bringing the swag! Megan's already sharpening her pencils to whip up limited edition sketch cards, one-of-a-kind custom sketches, and holy-crap-is-that-ever-cool signed editions of the book tricked out with sketches on multiple pages. Not to mention the illustrated cameos and illustrated cameo speaking roles that will appear in every edition and copy of the graphic novel. And that's not all! We've also got t-shirts, bundles of e-books, stacks of paperbacks...even the full manuscript of the sequel, Hell's Power. Remember, all our rewards are exclusive to Hell's Treasure Kickstarter backers.

Did Somebody Say Stretch?

When it comes to stretch goals, we've got big plans. Any funding above our goal amount will go toward new Hell's Treasure projects for you to enjoy...but if we stretch far enough, our wish list will really kick into gear. We hope you'll unlock the whole list, which we'll reveal as the project raises more money. But we can tell you this much: the sequel's already been written, and it won't shut up about making it into print!

<p><strong>WHO AM I? </strong></p>
<p>I go by Shade and have been an independent comic artist + writer for over fifteen years.</p>
<p>I’m the creator of such titles as Sinsationals, the Rule 34 Megazines and my most recent effort, SuperHeroes After Dark: Extreme.</p>
<p><strong>I’ve successfully shipped seven Kickstarter campaigns</strong>, and my recent Kickstarter for this very project was also a success, but I hope to expand the scope of the project even more with IndieGogo's help to give my original backers and new Indiegogo backers even more content than before!</p>

<p><strong>“Dangerous Curves vs MAVRIX”</strong> is an erotic comic project that pits two factions of the sexiest superwomen on Earth XXX against each other in a civil war.</p>
<p>This project will offer <i>THREE COMIC BOOKS</i> as primary rewards:</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Curves #1</strong>: an XXX-rated comic consisting of pinups and short stories featuring the most popular metahuman babes, alien supergirls, wondrous amazons, and pointy-eared vigilantes in comics today.</p>
<p><strong>MAVRIX #1</strong>: an XXX-rated comic consisting of pinups and short stories featuring the most popular marvelous mutants, inhumans and gamma-irradiated beauties in comics today.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous Curves vs MAVRIX</strong>: A sexy R-rated digital comic book where two factions of FEMALE SUPERHERO CHARACTERS CREATED BY ME face off in a battle whose conclusion will be decided by backers. This is part of the digital art suite content.</p>
<p>The other supplementary ""DIGITAL ART SUITE CONTENT"" includes the following:</p>
<p>""Dollhouse"" adult magazine: an X-rated pinup comic featuring MY ORIGINAL CHARACTERS from the Dangerous Curves and MAVRIX rosters in various states of undress.</p>
<p>Also, there is the ""Matreon"" subscription: backers will receive access to post-campaign art via updates, the duration of which is dependent on your selected reward tier.</p>
<p><strong>WHY GO THE ""InDemand"" ROUTE?</strong></p>
<p>The Kickstarter for ""Dangerous Curves vs MAVRIX"" recently closed and was massively successful. After the conclusion of the campaign, I had numerous backers suggest I use IndieGogo, and more specifically InDemand, to continue raising funds which would allow more stretch goals to be met, giving original--and new--backers, even more content for no additional cost to them.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Kickstarter, the rewards were relatively thin in regards to depth of content. However, after it ended and all the stretch goals were tallied, this is what was unlocked(and what new IndieGogo backers will get from the outset):</p>
<ul>
<li>two 10-page ""Dollhouse"" adult digital magazines (one for Dangerous Curves and one for MAVRIX)</li>
<li>7-page ""Dangerous Curves vs MAVRIX"" comic featuring a battle between the two titular groups consisting of original superheroine characters created by me</li>
<li>Dangerous Curves #1 (5 unlocked pinup pages and 6 mini-scenes)</li>
<li>MAVRIX #1 (5 unlocked pinup pages and 6 mini-scenes)</li>
<li>two full-color digital pinups showing the Dangerous Curves and MAVRIX girls in respective team shots</li>
<li>an additional introductory scene feat. the double agent character, SYLK (digital)</li>
<li>mock action figure box art of the Dangerous Curves character, Meta-Woman and the MAVRIX character, Ravenger X.</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan is that this will be a CONTINUATION of the Kickstarter and all of the planned stretch goals I had for that campaign will carry over here and IndieGogo backers will get everything the Kickstarter backers unlocked. In the end, everyone will get the same quantity of content. It's a win-win for everyone.</p>
<p>With all of the unlocked stretch goals, I'm going to be working on this project for months anyways, so I figured that continuing crowd-funding would be a way to unlock new goals as I work and give all my backers more for no additional cost to them.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Nova is a science fiction comic mini-series consisting of 6 books. It's being created by two people (with special thanks to a few others): Paul Benoit (writer) and Ricky <span class=""gD"">Gunawan</span>(artist). 
<p>This pitch, in fact, is being written by Paul. Hi. Here's something to consider. For as long as I've been able to remember I've had stories in my head that begged to be told. Ideas that needed to be put to paper. I know that for Ricky, aside from his love of art and his need to pay rent, this project means alot to him. But for me, it means everything. So I'm asking, please help us both share our story with the world!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $1650.</p>
<p>- The funds will be used so that the first comic book in the series can be completed. Afterwards we will attempted to get publishing or event self-publish depending on public interest. Afterwards, any sales of the comics will go towards further funding the remainder of the series and in the even of overflow will go towards a future creative project.</p>
<p>- The funds being asked for are all being paid to Ricky so he can continue to work on this project while passing up more lucrative work. He has bills to pay and realistically it can't be expected that he can take off so much time to work on the comic with recompense. Keep in mind that each page requires him to pencil, ink, color and letter. A week long process.</p>
<p>The perks we offer are all creative or appreciatory in nature. We offer things that we create, including the comic itself and concept art. Also we offer a few unique perks on top of the usual thank-you's and acknowledgements.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Nova isn't your run of the mill action comic. The sci-fi setting and close character interactivity of the setting allow us to explore many important themes and issues.</p>
<p>-Besides offering an enjoyable read, we hope to open people's minds up to many ideas from moral coersion and loyalty, identity and sexuality and truth and its virtues.</p>
<p>This is our first project together but we have been able to collaborate for over two months in order to complete the pitch pages you see here. This should stand as a testimony of our ability to accomplish what we set out to achieve.</p>
<p>Give us your support and we will make this happen!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any help you can offer is welcome and the very nature of this crowdfunding site should highlight just how much people can accomplish when they work together. Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.</p>
<p>- Spread the word! Like our facebook page and recommend the book to friends and family who like a good sci-fi story!<br/>- Share! Share! Share! I don't know if we've mentioned that yet.</p>

</div></div>","That is 23 pages + Galaxy newcast from world of our heroes comicbook in  juicy, colorful art by   @horblackhole, and awesome space story by Danis O'stanin!
 
   IN THE SAME SHIP  is a sci-fi adventure in a dangerous universe with lost worlds, ancient  magic, dark goverment projects and black markets, based on history of the ancient galaxy, lasting billion years. 
  The action of the story is set around a team of absolutely different friends, united by the search for adventures and new knowledge about the world in which they live. Tireless researchers, always ready to wade through the furthest reaches of the galaxy and explore lost planets. Sometimes they do not refuse to earn money by smuggling. 
 


 
 By coincidence, team knows about proto-civilization which existed 13 billion years ago. That race has reached the highest level of development and universe knowledge. Ancient legends called them “Creators”,  but nobody knows anything else, billion years ago they were gone without a traces.
The government carefully tries to hide the traces of their existence, and any artifacts left from the ancient race are out of the law.

  The military company of the government - Consolidated Coalition (CC) has taken control, over inhabited part of the galaxy, and dictates its rules. Goods from planets not controlled by CC are prohibited, and of course they can be bought on the black market. Also possession of any type of space transport banned, all transportation is carried out by government companies.                             
 
   Bak was born in a hereditary family of mechanics and always had interest for different technologies. As a child  he sneaked into his grandfather’s workshop and watched how he created electronic devices from junk.  When Bak was 7, he assembled his first cold fusion reactor and sold it to smugglers, he earned enough money, after that, he left school and began to study independently, in parallel fulfilling orders for repair and restoration of space ships for the black market.
 

In the last year of the university, Chad combined obsolete computers from the library into own neural-net and, with their help, stole classified information about biochemistry from government databases, this attracted the attention of Consolidated Coalition. Later, they recruited him to perform informal assignments, which gave him an excellent opportunity to learn the system of government from the inside. In his spare time, he studied the interaction between bioactive elements on tissues and organisms, based on the government secret data, which helped Chad to succeed considerably in this direction.
 

Nobody knows about Klod, even himself. His first memory was about outer space, he found himself among the wreckage of space ships. As it turned out, the special structure of Klod organism allowed him to live in outer space without a spacesuit. After hours of searching, he found an emergency lighthouse and turned it on, hoping to escape. By lucky chance, Bak flew to the signal, and found him.

<h3><strong>BASED ON TRUE CRIMES AND REAL EVENTS</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>'If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you.'</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ME AND THE DEVIL BLUES</strong> is volume one of the three part story <strong>BAD NEWS ALL DAY</strong>, a dark and desolate tale of macabre crime. Follow Detective Jim Mulhearn as he navigates the sewers of soul and psyche while the threads of his humanity snap one by one. In the gloom of a decaying city, in the shadow of trackless woods, in the limitless depths of the mind; will he find justice or be lost forever, swallowed in darkness?</p>
<p>This story is informed by true crimes and real experiences of the paranormal; uncomfortable truths hidden in the dark corners of the world. It was written using several methods of spirit-communication in a haunted house since abandoned and burnt-out (not by the author we might add, but that's another story),  as a way of coming to terms with unfolding real-life horrors. The exegesis of a true dark night of the soul, this book is an authentic artefact of spiritual darkness. </p>
<p>Further drawing inspiration from works such as True Detective, Twin Peaks, Seven and the canon of artists like Junji Ito, Robert Chambers, Poe, Milton, Hodgson, Lovecraft Et Al; this is a story for those left unsatisfied by the pale shadows and cheap scares of other graphic horror. </p>
<p>Previously available only through local retailers, the copies made available sold out quickly and this campaign allows readers worldwide to collect this unique new book. Fully complete, the paperback features a campaign specific bookplate and at 186 pages with THREE bonus short stories of horror and weird fiction PLUS designs for a wholly new and unique form of tarot deck (separate deck also available as an add-on with this campaign); <strong>ME AND THE DEVIL BLUES</strong> offers incredible value to the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Please note this book contains graphic violence and language, it is not intended for all readers and discretion is advised.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE BLACK TAROT </strong>forms a completely new and unseen tarot style deck of cards. It was created for use in the story and inspired by the illustrations of artists like Lee Brown Coye and Edmund Gorey, forming both an evocative collection of artwork and a tool of divination. The deck will be presented in a black drawstring pouch and is available separately or as part of both the paperback and hardback collector's packages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NEW ENGLAND TALES </strong>was the very first collection of stories that would serve as inspiration for the creation of Paimon Press as a publisher of graphic horror. The first two stories <i>Choir Boy </i>and <i>We Are Making a New World </i>were inspired by the weird fiction of H.P. Lovecraft while the third is an illustration of his poem <i>The Bells </i>from <i>The Fungi From Yuggoth</i>. They are rough but inspired short stories that betray the madness and darkness that would inform the creation of <i>Bad News All Day</i>. They are sure to be of particular interest to any discerning epicurean of the macabre. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SAD STORIES #1 </strong>is an 'ashcan' style comic in the same dimensions as the paperback. It includes a short prequel story plus additional material. This is the only way this material will ever be available bound separately and is a must for any serious collector. Each volume of<i> Bad News All Day</i> will have its appendix edition of <i>Sad Stories</i> released alongside it but will only be available in limited numbers. After the campaign ends there may only be a few additional copies left if at all so reserve your copy now. The story material is not necessary to read the main volumes and will eventually be compiled into any future complete omnibus edition, but each ashcan will include several pages that won't be reprinted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PAIMON PRESS COLLECTOR'S CARDS </strong>With each campaign launched by Paimon Press we will make a collector's card available. These cards will only be available to backers of the collector's package and ONLY during the campaign. In the future, exclusive rewards will be available to card collector's with the highest rewards available to those with a complete collection.

<h3>The Last Pick-Up Artist</h3>
<p>I always wanted to make Comics. I drew and made storys since I was little. When my Cousin showed me ""The X-Men - Age of Apocalypse"" and Frank Millers ""Sin City"" in 1996 I was hooked. Comics is all I ever wanted to do. I was that nerd, with dermatites, asthma, and slightly skinny fat. When I was 14 I saw the first American Pie in 1999 and listened to blink 182. When I saw Shannon Elisabeth strip on the Screen i wanted to be Jimbo. But that was not my reality... my father died when I was 5, and my overprotective mother wanted me to be save. So I grew up, being ""that"" ackward Kid. No Girlfriend... Videogames and Drawing. I turned 18 and I was losing in all areas of my life. I was unhappy with my Body, my Skin, My Career (i had none), ....and all I ever wanted was a Girlfriend, to make Comics and be Awesome.</p>
<p>I went trough some dark lousy years. Than I had enough. At 23/24 I had enough, I started working out, I tried to get into Artschool and I dared to dream. In a long time Girls started to notice me again. I liked one very much, something started to develop, but then I screwed it up and ended up heartbroken. And on top, nobody really cared. Just one Friend pulled me out of the Dark, and showed me a new Way. Who would have thought that the quest to ""get layed"" would be the quest to become ""a real human beeing"".</p>
<p>I got into filmschool, since there was no comic school. But I always drew and made animated drawn stuff.... and so the Idea grew to tell my story, but in a fictionalized way.</p>
<p>This is when I created The Last Pick-Up Aritst.</p>
<p><strong>This is a Comic about Change, Love, Authenticity, The World,... and becoming who you are meant to be.</strong></p>

<h3>Comics is for the People, for YOU!</h3>
<p>The Last Pick-Up Arist 1 &amp; 2 are one complete Story Arc!</p>
<p>My Comics will always be for Free (on the Web). This is a marathon, and I have so much storys to tell and Comics to write, draw and color. All the Comics I will do in my life will be for print, because it is a magical feeling to hold such a Comic in my Hands and read it in a quite moment. I really love to share that feeling of a Printed Copy with you and I know you love the smell of fresh printed Comics in your Hand too. The Kickstarter is for the Printing and Shipping of The Last Pick Up Artist #1 &amp; #2.</p>
<p>So If you like what you see, Back it!</p>

<h3>You can help make more of these!</h3>
<p>ll be frank with you. I am at the start of my career. But I want to make the best Art and Storys for you, and I wont go away and I will keep learning and get better at this Art.</p>
<p>Comic is wonderfull and it matters. And I know all this years I spent, watching TV, Movies, Tv's Shows, X-Files, Firefly, Spaghetti Western, John Carpenter Movies, Vampires, Werewolves (From Dusk Till Dawn, Ginger Snaps), Highschool Movies, School of Rock...the Games, from Mario, Wario, Zelda to WWE and PRimal Rage. I sucked it all up. And I am ready to spit it all out again on the Paper in form of Comics, with things I want to share with you guys and girls about life, meaning and fun. So help me make these, if you want to be a part of this!</p>

</div></div>","The Last Pick-Up Artist
I always wanted to make Comics. I drew and made storys since I was little. When my Cousin showed me ""The X-Men - Age of Apocalypse"" and Frank Millers ""Sin City"" in 1996 I was hooked. Comics is all I ever wanted to do. I was that nerd, with dermatites, asthma, and slightly skinny fat. When I was 14 I saw the first American Pie in 1999 and listened to blink 182. When I saw Shannon Elisabeth strip on the Screen i wanted to be Jimbo. But that was not my reality... my father died when I was 5, and my overprotective mother wanted me to be save. So I grew up, being ""that"" ackward Kid. No Girlfriend... Videogames and Drawing. I turned 18 and I was losing in all areas of my life. I was unhappy with my Body, my Skin, My Career (i had none), ....and all I ever wanted was a Girlfriend, to make Comics and be Awesome.
I went trough some dark lousy years. Than I had enough. At 23/24 I had enough, I started working out, I tried to get into Artschool and I dared to dream. In a long time Girls started to notice me again. I liked one very much, something started to develop, but then I screwed it up and ended up heartbroken. And on top, nobody really cared. Just one Friend pulled me out of the Dark, and showed me a new Way. Who would have thought that the quest to ""get layed"" would be the quest to become ""a real human beeing"".
I got into filmschool, since there was no comic school. But I always drew and made animated drawn stuff.... and so the Idea grew to tell my story, but in a fictionalized way.
This is when I created The Last Pick-Up Aritst.
This is a Comic about Change, Love, Authenticity, The World,... and becoming who you are meant to be.
If you want to Read Issue #1 or want WATCH the Animated Version (by Jeff Allen), check it out!


 



Comics is for the People, for YOU!
The Last Pick-Up Arist 1 & 2 are one complete Story Arc!
My Comics will always be for Free (on the Web). This is a marathon, and I have so much storys to tell and Comics to write, draw and color. All the Comics I will do in my life will be for print, because it is a magical feeling to hold such a Comic in my Hands and read it in a quite moment. I really love to share that feeling of a Printed Copy with you and I know you love the smell of fresh printed Comics in your Hand too.

To Color it i use the Old 63 Marvel Comics Color Palete.

Yes...Ladys and Music will get your spirits high.
 

Follow your Bliss, know thyself.Ddont just work For money or EGO. But get the money in to make your dreams possible. Cashflow is important to build a dream!

Such am I, a person that takes something fake and manages to subtract a reality from it, a private person, not very easily approachable and some might even go so far as to say I was anti-social at times. Thus my alias became Pseudo-B, an artistic girl with nothing more than passion and a sketchbook ready to paint a fabricated reality. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been curious about expressing myself. I wanted to know, what exactly is that makes me genuinely happy, longing sadness or creative fulfillment. Why do sometimes I struggle while others I find a way to thrive despite the most challenging circumstances. I found that the best way to truly be inspired is to look at deepest and darkest corners of my inner demons and always trying to reach out to the people who love a more mysterious twist of artistic expression. Although I do not appeal to everyone as they might find my style a little bit weird, as long they are people who are looking to get lost in the unknown are bound to appreciate my creative thoughts. I hold an extreme love for creating compelling characters with different levers of depth and thought provoking stories that some might even find relatable. Hence I started making my own graphic novel with characters based on people familiar to me and situations that hold true, trying to give a more realistic approach to an otherwise fictional world and try different ways to experiment with storytelling, explore the characters while making them feel like real people with real problems. I want to reach out strongly to people with mental disabilities, such as depression and anxiety, in order to help them express themselves through art and design, people who feel society has turned its back on them, who have yet found their own place and want to immerse themselves into place they wish to explore. and show them that there are so many different ways to express themselves. I believe that illustration could help people heal and give them a voice. I have spent a lot of time researching my target audience, and although they all come from different political, age, ethnic, gender, and cultural backgrounds, they all have one thing in common, they have expressed interest in the darker side of art. I do not want to define my market by age group, location or job description. I want to reach all consumers who are interested in dark art, and want to explore this type of art more.

<p>Hey, do you want to save the comic book industry? I want to save the comic book industry. And together, I know we can do it.  With your help, my heroes can save the comic book industry. </p>
<p>Hi, I’m Robert Wilkinson. Some of you may recognize me from my YouTube channel as Red Shirt One, or on Facebook and Twitter as  J[uxtaephyeal] Kek Maloy, co author of The Chronicles of Torlenth (the Kek name originated decades before the kek meme). Anyone who read the HMTU Oracle between 1993 and 1995 would recall the stories I authored while there: <i>Steve Logan, Private Eye</i> and the original five short story cycle that kicked off all this glorious madness: <i>Project: WarCar, Dawn of the Night, Mach Force, Full Recon, and Death Machine. </i> Others may remember me as their co-author for the six novel set <i>Knight Rangers</i> by  R. R. Wilkinson and D.A. Earhart.</p>
<p>As you can tell by the resume, I’m a writer.  I don’t have the skill to draw legibly, and apparently I am unable to find artists, so I am using the Robot Chicken model (Seth Green on High, praise be his name) to craft the comic book that I have been writing since 1993.  It was Ms Geeky Sparkles, of Clownfish TV (blessed be Her Brushable Hair), who lit the fire under my ass (“It doesn’t matter how you get it done, just get it done.”).</p>
<p>So I started with my iPad, the ComicBook! app and a lot of DCUO (DC Comics Universe Online – an MMORPG that I quite enjoy playing).  I had harvested solo screenshots of my DCUO characters to use as stock, but the quality wasn’t what I wanted.  I also wanted more control over the model, the camera angle, the ability to insert the swipe arc on a punch thrown, as well as the overall flavor of each panel. </p>
<p>It was then that I moved to experiment with the Robot Chicken model. I had a Rock n Roll 1:6 scale and Major Bludd 1:6 scale G.I. Joes, their Jeep, and an American Staffordshire terrier I had found at a rummage.  Using them, I made a three page short (equivalent to a normal cut to scene in any comic book), which I will be posting on my bitchute, link in the description.</p>
<p>When I showed it to my other half, I think I impressed him in that he has indulged me my quest to make my own comic book.  Three trips to Ollie’s and a cardboard soundstage on my living room floor later, I developed my form.  I published <i>Night Force #1 The Dark Before </i>in March and knew what I had to do.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.  This is where you get to direct-inject your money into the industry where it needs it most, when it needs it most: right now, right here, within the pages of the River City Saga from Roh’Nar Media. I need to purchase action figures that bear no pre-existing licensing.  I found a website which builds exactly what I need, but the volume of figures I need (at last informal count, across my entire universe, thirty-nine main characters) plus wardrobe, vehicles, accessories, and hardcopy printing costs would cost a whopping $8,000.  It is money I would need to have in full before I can begin the project. </p>
<p>The River City Saga encompasses the two flagship team titles (Night Force and Knight Rangers) and the associated solo character titles.  The saga follows the lives of a pair of brothers-at-odds (David and Sean Crozier) as they navigate their lives, separated by only sixty miles, against a backdrop of attempted alien invasions, corrupt government agents, superpowered threats, and a domestic terrorist group. David heads the Night Force, a cadre of parasapiens that gravitated to David’s cause; Sean leads the Knight Rangers, a hand-picked group of humans trying to take their city streets back from the criminal element.</p>
<p>This is what you get out of the deal:</p>
<p>It is a graduated scale of reward.  There are 5 tiers, each with a hard copy subscription proportionate to that tier:</p>
<p>$10 tier receives a one year hard copy subscription  and a randomly chosen three-poster pack (24”x36”, 12”x16”, and 10 ¼”x6 5/8”);</p>
<p>$50 tier gets a two year hardcopy subscription to the flagship title (Night Force) and poster pack;</p>
<p>$100 tier gets a two year hardcopy subscription to the flagship title (Night Force), poster pack and an interior QR code for the digital copy of their subscription;</p>
<p>$500 tier receives five year hardcopy subscription to the flagship title (Night Force), poster pack, qr code, and one original, randomly selected raw page (10 ¼”x 6 5/8”) in hardcopy, signed (proviso: If said original random signed page is found to be in digital format, the recipient of the random signed page will be forfeit their subscription);</p>
<p>$1,000-or-more tier receives a life time subscription to Night Force, poster pack, qr code, and one original random signed raw 24”x36” poster (the same stipulations apply for the poster as for the page).</p>
<p>While you watch this video, I will be continuing the current story line in its current state.  Once the goal has been reached, the order placed and received, production will continue with the new models and back issues will be produced to fulfill tier requirements.</p>
<p>In closing, if you want to help save the comic book industry, please … be a hero to my heroes.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Tunguska is a graphic novel about a secret expedition to Siberia in 1908. The story is based on a true event (a meteorite exploded above the region, flattening a vast forest) but we have mixed in fantastical elements and historical figures, including Rasputin, Lenin, Trotsky and Nikola Tesla. The graphic novel has been a pet project for the best part of three years for me as a writer and for drawing artist Stijn Felix.</p>
<p>After we won a two-yearly comic competition, in 2010-2011 the Belgian weekly magazine Focus Knack ran the first 43 pages of Tunguska, ending on a cliffhanger. In order to complete the story, 13 more pages are needed. This funding campaign has the goal to complete these pages and to print a 1,000 copy run of the graphic novel.</p>
<p>Your contribution will not only make our lifelong dream of publishing a graphic novel come true, You'll get a great yarn in return as well!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>In order to get Tunguska published we need 12,500 dollars. The money will go to drawing the remaining 13 pages, printing a run of 1,000 graphic novels and shipping them to you.</p>
<p>If you pledge a certain amount of money, you will also get one of these very nice perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name added as a sponsor</li>
<li>A unique Tunguska bookholder</li>
<li>A signed edition, including an original sketch</li>
<li>An original page, authographed by the authors</li>
<li>A special, signed edition of the graphic novel, including pencil drawings of all 56 pages</li>

another of his great passions; observe the world.

<p style=""color:#00449c;""><strong><i>""A bizarre, little comedy. A superhero comic book that works."" ~Comic Buyer's Guide</i></strong></p>
<p>Hey Comic Book fans and Indigogo backers, my name is Jonnie Allan and I am the creator, writer, artist, colorist, letterer, &amp; publisher of <strong>The Miscellaneous Adventures of STYKMAN™</strong>.  Yep, I do it all. Crazy, I know.</p>
<p>In 2005 I introduced my beloved creation to the comic book world to a rather incredible reception and some pretty amazing fanfare.</p>
<p style=""color:#00449c;""><i><strong>""A breath of fresh, silly air that's sorely needed in a time dominated by crises, decimations, and civil wars."" ~Broken Frontier</strong></i></p>
<p>It was picked up and distributed by <strong>Diamond Comic Distributors</strong> and even stamped with their seal of approval <strong>“Certified Cool.”</strong></p>
<p>It went on to be named as <strong>one of the top independent comics</strong> not once, not twice, but three years in a row by WIZARD Magazine.</p>
<p>The license was even picked up by a toy manufacturer that began making STYKMAN collectibles– a dream come true for any indie creator to be sure.</p>
<p>And yet, in spite of all of the accolades and benchmark successes, certain gatekeepers, obstacles, and ridiculous industry hurdles placed in front of independent creators like myself, forced me to make the incredibly painful decision to bring the series to an untimely end. STYKMAN was no more. (Sigh.)</p>
<p>But now 10 years later, and this is where you come in, it’s time to bring everyone’s favorite bumbling buffoon of a branch back for more madcap adventurers and hilarious hijinks.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">_____________________</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><strong>The Miscellaneous Adventures of STYKMAN™</strong> is a silly and fun, all-ages comic book series that tells the story of the next arrogant, not-so-bright superhero trying desperately to fill the void left behind by <strong>The Legendary Capt. BUCK NEKID (ret.)™</strong>.  Cruising into crime-fighting on his high powered “big wheel,” this bumbling, buffoon of a branch, along with his enigmatic extraterrestrial sidekick AL, will somehow prove himself worthy of the global adulation, he believes, he so richly deserves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542250759/a530hqtk35z7nmlft5sj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Filled with pop-culture references and a color palette reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon, STYKMAN somehow manages to stumble his way into saving the day time and time again.  Through bungled crime scenes, botched rescue attempts, and sheer dumb luck, our hero wannabe, equipped with his <strong>Uranium Enriched R-34 Spin-jibber</strong>, has unwittingly defeated Crazed Confectioners, three-headed poodles, demonic hordes, exploding toilets, and even helped stave off the end of the world by “participating” in a no-holds-barred competition of valor and vindication...</p>

<p>Don't get me started on the pigeons!</p>
<h3>The New Comic</h3>
<p>In a new and expanded 48-page story, STYKMAN has been captured by the villainous <strong>General SOD the Dirt Clod™</strong> in an attempt to exact revenge on any “hero” attempting to claim the mantle of The Legendary Capt. BUCK NEKID (ret.)™. It will take every zany thought and incredibly stupid scheme for our emaciated egotist to escape the evil clutches of this Crumbling Curmudgeon. Will our hero escape?  Will Sod Succeed? Will AL finish his high stakes game of <i>Skiddly Piddly</i> with Uncle Dicky coming to the rescue? Only you can help answer those questions.</p>
<p>This will be the first issue in an ongoing, full color, laugh-out-series series. I have some amazing and incredibly silly stories that I never got to tell. Your pledge will help finally bring those stories to life.</p>

<h3>Why Bring Back STYKMAN Now?</h3>
<p>Timing is everything. And I truly believe that now is the perfect time to bring STYKMAN back.</p>
<p>I remember a time as a kid when you could walk into any store that sold comics and grab any issue off of the rack. Unfortunately, those days are gone. Parents need to be concerned about what their children are reading; heck, even adults need to be concerned with what we are reading these days. Although there are some all-ages books out there, there are certainly not enough.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, the comic book industry has grown a little dark, and seemingly uninspired as of late. It’s time to inject a little levity back into this world of escapism that we all love so very much. It’s time to make comics fun again. And with your help, we can do just that.</p>
<p>What are you waiting for? Let's do this!</p>

<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You Get in Return</h3>

<p>Any remaining funds will be put back into the production of future issues allowing me to bring the same quality at a lower cost.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although this is my first crowdfunding campaign, this is not my first foray into comics.</p>
<p>A little over 10 years ago I produced a series of comics that I was directly responsible for every step of the journey: from production to printing, publishing to distribution.</p>
<p>My goal at the time was to create a product that was of such high caliber and quality that you could not tell the difference between my independent title and the major publishers when sitting side by side on a shelf. Ironically enough, you could– <i>I used better paper!</i></p>
<p>All that said, it is possible that there could be delays– such is the nature of producing quality products. Possible delays may be associated with shipping, customs or even the printing process itself. Depending on which stretch goals are unlocked – I will be using several different suppliers all with different timetables – there could be delays with the delivery from those vendors as well.</p>
<p>I have gone to great lengths to research and vet the companies that I will be using for producing my comic book series and collectibles. However, whenever you plan the production you also have to plan that things will not always go according to plan (Try saying that 10 times fast.).</p>
<p>I believe in sticking to deadlines and believe strongly in open communication and transparency. I will make it my number one priority to update everyone with the progress, challenges, and triumphs every step of the way.</p>
<p>The book is fully scripted with quite a few pages of the line art already completed (See below). I will be working on the book as the campaign runs posting updates as I go. </p>

Hey Comic Book fans and Indigogo backers, my name is Jonnie Allan and I am the creator, writer, artist, colorist, letterer, & publisher of The Miscellaneous Adventures of STYKMAN™.  Yep, I do it all. Crazy, I know.
In 2005 I introduced my beloved creation to the comic book world to a rather incredible reception and some pretty amazing fanfare.
""A breath of fresh, silly air that's sorely needed in a time dominated by crises, decimations, and civil wars."" ~Broken Frontier
It was picked up and distributed by Diamond Comic Distributors and even stamped with their seal of approval “Certified Cool.”
It went on to be named as one of the top independent comics not once, not twice, but three years in a row by WIZARD Magazine.
The license was even picked up by a toy manufacturer that began making STYKMAN collectibles– a dream come true for any indie creator to be sure.
And yet, in spite of all of the accolades and benchmark successes, certain gatekeepers, obstacles, and ridiculous industry hurdles placed in front of independent creators like myself, forced me to make the incredibly painful decision to bring the series to an untimely end. STYKMAN was no more. (Sigh.)
But now 10 years later, and this is where you come in, it’s time to bring everyone’s favorite bumbling buffoon of a branch back for more madcap adventurers and hilarious hijinks.
_____________________
The Story
The Miscellaneous Adventures of STYKMAN™ is a silly and fun, all-ages comic book series that tells the story of the next arrogant, not-so-bright superhero trying desperately to fill the void left behind by The Legendary Capt. BUCK NEKID (ret.)™.  Cruising into crime-fighting on his high powered “big wheel,” this bumbling, buffoon of a branch, along with his enigmatic extraterrestrial sidekick AL, will somehow prove himself worthy of the global adulation, he believes, he so richly deserves.

Filled with pop-culture references and a color palette reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon, STYKMAN somehow manages to stumble his way into saving the day time and time again.  Through bungled crime scenes, botched rescue attempts, and sheer dumb luck, our hero wannabe, equipped with his Uranium Enriched R-34 Spin-jibber, has unwittingly defeated Crazed Confectioners, three-headed poodles, demonic hordes, exploding toilets, and even helped stave off the end of the world by “participating” in a no-holds-barred competition of valor and vindication...

Don't get me started on the pigeons!
The New Comic
In a new and expanded 48-page story, STYKMAN has been captured by the villainous General SOD the Dirt Clod™ in an attempt to exact revenge on any “hero” attempting to claim the mantle of The Legendary Capt. BUCK NEKID (ret.)™. It will take every zany thought and incredibly stupid scheme for our emaciated egotist to escape the evil clutches of this Crumbling Curmudgeon. Will our hero escape?  Will Sod Succeed? Will AL finish his high stakes game of Skiddly Piddly with Uncle Dicky coming to the rescue? Only you can help answer those questions.
This will be the first issue in an ongoing, full color, laugh-out-series series. I have some amazing and incredibly silly stories that I never got to tell. Your pledge will help finally bring those stories to life.
""If humor is the measure, STYKMAN does indeed live up to the earlier tradition and recalls The Tick, Ambush Bug, Groo the Wanderer & more..."" ~ Silver Bullet (4 out of 5 Bullets)
The Cast of Characters




""A sharp mix of The Tick and The Pink Panther... These over the top superheroics provide the perfect solution for anybody getting a little too much angst out of the mainstream."" ~ Wizard Magazine

Why Bring Back STYKMAN Now?
Timing is everything. And I truly believe that now is the perfect time to bring STYKMAN back.
I remember a time as a kid when you could walk into any store that sold comics and grab any issue off of the rack. Unfortunately, those days are gone. Parents need to be concerned about what their children are reading; heck, even adults need to be concerned with what we are reading these days. Although there are some all-ages books out there, there are certainly not enough.
Let’s face it, the comic book industry has grown a little dark, and seemingly uninspired as of late. It’s time to inject a little levity back into this world of escapism that we all love so very much. It’s time to make comics fun again. And with your help, we can do just that.
What are you waiting for? Let's do this!

What's Needed & What You Get in Return
The funds needed for this project are $15,000. I know it seems like a lot; it takes a lot to produce a quality comic. A good portion of the funds will go to printing, packaging, and shipping costs, as well as fees charged by IndieGoGo and Stripe (Credit Card processor.).
Any remaining funds will be put back into the production of future issues allowing me to bring the same quality at a lower cost.
In exchange for your backing the campaign – depending on which perk level you choose – you will receive:

_____________________



If I raise beyond what I need to relaunch the series, I will begin unlocking ""Stretch Goals"" bringing more fun-filled entertainment for your same contribution. More BANG for your BUCK (Not NEKID). Some of those stretch goals will include an additional 16 pages to the comic bringing it to a whopping 64 pages, bookmarks, posters, and foil-wrapped trading cards with gum. That's right,  gum!!!
So what are you waiting for? Click on a Perk and let's get this party started.
“…a fun-filled adventure that young and old will enjoy.” ~ Sequential Tart

Risks & Challenges
Although this is my first crowdfunding campaign, this is not my first foray into comics.
A little over 10 years ago I produced a series of comics that I was directly responsible for every step of the journey: from production to printing, publishing to distribution.
My goal at the time was to create a product that was of such high caliber and quality that you could not tell the difference between my independent title and the major publishers when sitting side by side on a shelf. Ironically enough, you could– I used better paper!
All that said, it is possible that there could be delays– such is the nature of producing quality products. Possible delays may be associated with shipping, customs or even the printing process itself. Depending on which stretch goals are unlocked – I will be using several different suppliers all with different timetables – there could be delays with the delivery from those vendors as well.
I have gone to great lengths to research and vet the companies that I will be using for producing my comic book series and collectibles. However, whenever you plan the production you also have to plan that things will not always go according to plan (Try saying that 10 times fast.).
I believe in sticking to deadlines and believe strongly in open communication and transparency. I will make it my number one priority to update everyone with the progress, challenges, and triumphs every step of the way.
The book is fully scripted with quite a few pages of the line art already completed (See below). I will be working on the book as the campaign runs posting updates as I go. 
If you need to get ahold of me at any time you are welcome to post a comment here or email me directly at jonnie@stykmanlives.com.

<p><strong>AMAZON ARROW ADULT COMIC</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br/>DeviantArt 3D artist Chryseis/amazonarrow has for years now shared her original character, Amazon Arrow, to the world.  Releasing one artwork after another with her 3D imagery, Chryseis has garnered a strong following and even ran her own successful IndieGoGo campaign last year to create a short movie starring Amazon Arrow in a production with Steve Noir for FearGirl Meets Amazon Arrow.  It was quite sensual and alluring.  You can find the video at <a href=""http://www.feargirl.com/feargirl-meet-amazon-arrow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.feargirl.com/feargirl-meet-amazon-ar...</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to make things a whole lot more explicit in a comic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong><br/>The Amazon Arrow Adult Comic is planned to be a short 9-page pornographic comic, including the cover page which you see is already created, that delves into a dark, though non-canon, portion of Amazon Arrow's life when she is captured by someone that is her opposite and taken advantage of in explicit detail. With permission from Chryseis, this comic will be created and released digitally to those that donated.  The themes of the comic revolve around the fetishes of bondage, kidnap, damsel in distress, non-consensual sexual intercourse, and filming of said intercourse. </p>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: </strong>If the campaign succeeds, the comic's production can only begin 15 days after when the donation is transferred to me by IndieGoGo.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong><br/>Due to the level of quality and detail that I aim to publish in and balancing it with speediness with a professional grade artist, colorist, and graphic designer taking part, each page will be expensive. The minimum goal to reach for the comic to begin is $1200 for the 8 comic pages that needs to be created.  Stretch goals will follow afterwards in the increments of $200 of increasing the comic by one additional page.  This increment ends at the stretch goal of $2600 at 15 pages.  Two last stretch goals after that will be $3600 for 20 pages and $4600 for 25 pages.  All exceeds below or past these stretch goals will go towards the creation of other comic projects in my Patreon: <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/drb7364"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.patreon.com/drb7364</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the reward tier to secure your copy of the comic, and a few other goodies for the higher tiers that involves comics my Patreon.  The Patreon comics are all 7-8 pages long, including the cover page.</p>
<p>Also, this comic requires your patience above all else.  The donation of a successful campaign is transferred after 15 days by the rules of IndieGoGo.  With the comic at 8 pages, it would take at least two to four months to complete the comic once the campaign is done and after the money is received.  I will try to get the comic out as quickly as I can but I do not want to degrade the quality of the pages.  As stretch goals are achieved, the longer it would take for the comic to finish with each page needing at least two to three weeks to finish.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOALS</strong><br/>The first seven stretch goals follow each other at $200, the first stretch goal for $1400/9 pages and the seventh at $2600/15 pages.  The eighth and last stretch goals are $3600/20 pages and $4600/25 pages respectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong><br/>Amazon Arrow has faced many dangers and many problems.  She has suffered humiliating defeats and sexual assaults but always came out on top.  Now she faces an opponent like no other.  Preyed upon by an unseen foe in the middle of the night, Amazon Arrow brings her quarry to the darkness of a forest only to be attacked and defeated by the Poacher.  Left at his mercy, the Poacher takes advantage of Amazon Arrow.  Will this be the end of Amazon Arrow?  Or just her dignity?</p>

<p align=""left"">SIDEKICK ISLAND is a perfect-bound 48-page full-color graphic novel. But that’s not all. It’s a love letter to the Silver- and Bronze-Age of comics. It’s also a parody of all the stereotypes and tropes from those eras while being jam-packed from page one with “analog” sidekicks doomed from the moment they wake up on the beach.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to SIDEKICK ISLAND!
With your backing we can bring this book to life on IndieGoGo.
Join a ridiculous amount of superhero sidekicks on a deserted island as they go full Hunger Games on each other. In this 48-page battle royale of a comic book, forty-four sidekicks enter but only one will survive the bloody island competition. Please consider backing the campaign to help us bring this book to life--and to find out who survives!

SIDEKICK ISLAND is a perfect-bound 48-page full-color graphic novel. But that’s not all. It’s a love letter to the Silver- and Bronze-Age of comics. It’s also a parody of all the stereotypes and tropes from those eras while being jam-packed from page one with “analog” sidekicks doomed from the moment they wake up on the beach.

 

Co-written and created by the writing team of Scott McCullough and Duncan Walker, SIDEKICK ISLAND will be brought to life by backers like you and the art team of Joel (Death of Superman – The Wake) Ojeda, Milen (GI Joe) Parvanov, and Eric (Cyber Frog) Weathers. Scott has produced two successful IndieGoGo campaigns. The rest of our creative team has worked in and around the comic book and gaming industry for decades and have contributed to several successful crowdfunding projects. Your perks are in good hands!

Watch SIDEKICK ISLAND come to life!

<p></p>Je rêve depuis longtemps de me lancer dans la grande aventure que peut être la création d'une bande dessinée.<p></p>
<p>Et là vous vous demandez : pourquoi faire çà via une plateforme de crowdfunding ? <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Et bien parce qu'au delà d'une simple BD je souhaite pouvoir proposer un contenu vraiment complet sur ce que peut être <b>Illyne </b>et proposer quelque chose de différent de l'édition classique.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">C'est pourquoi j'ai choisi cette méthode qui (je l'espère) si le financement atteint son objectif, me permettra de vous proposer le<b> premier Tome</b> d'<b>Illyne</b> ainsi qu'un <b>artbook </b>qui traitera de l'univers, des personnages, et des légendes du vaste monde qui accueille les aventures de notre protagoniste, accompagné de croquis de recherche, et différents concept art.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">En plus de çà, je vous proposerai de petits bonus, tels que des lithographie au tirage limité qui je l'espère sauront trouver </span>intéret à vos yeux.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Toutefois, pour pouvoir vous proposer un prix proche des tarifs pratiqués en librairie, je dois réunir une somme assez </span>conséquente<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> qui me permettra de lancer d'importants tirages des </span>œuvres<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> pour que les </span>coûts de productions soient intéressants.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Voila</b>, vous savez à peu près tout de <b>ce qui me motive dans cette nouvelle aventure</b> qui ne verra le jour que si elle suscite votre intérêt à vous aussi.

(pages en cours de réalisation)





Illyne est un projet de BD de Johann ""Papayou"" BLAIS. Il s'agit d'une BD traitant d'une enquête dans un univers médiéval fantastique, au format franco-belge.Ce livre comprendra 68 pages, aura une couverture rigide et sera accompagné d'un artbook sur l'univers et les légendes ( de 64 pages ) du monde fantastique dans lequel évolue notre héroïne. Sa sortie est prévue pour début 2015.

Pitch



Notre BD suit les aventures d’Illyne, jeune orpheline, éduquée par Talak, son oncle archéologue. Via cette éducation elle va elle même devenir spécialiste en anciennes civilisations, chercheuse de temples et assistera durant plusieurs années Talak dans son travail et ses expéditions. 
Suite au décès de son oncle, elle va découvrir des lettres écrites par un mystérieux ami du défunt. N’ayant plus de « but » précis dans la vie elle décide de partir à la recherche de cet énigmatique correspondant qui ne signe ses courriers que d'un sceau inconnu. Elle va découvrir l’existence d’une confrérie secrète à laquelle son oncle était rattaché et va se retrouver au milieu d’une affaire qui la dépasse.

Les personnages



Illyne est une orpheline. Elle a perdu ses parents quand elle a avait 11 ans suite à un accident de chasse. Élevée par le frère de son père elle va apprendre à ses côtés l’archéologie, à lire les textes anciens et l’histoire des anciennes civilisations mais également l’art du combat. Son arme de prédilection est la lance. Ayant grandi totalement recluse dans les montagnes, elle est, au delà de sa force et de son agilité, naïve sur certains points.


 Après la mort de son oncle au cours d’une expédition archéologique, elle découvre dans les effets de ce dernier, des lettres d’un mystérieux correspondant signant d'un sceau inconnu. Elle décide de partir à sa recherche en commençant son enquête par la bibliothèque de la capitale !


Elric est un puit de connaissance, étant le fils de feu le gérant de la bibliothèque de la capitale il a vécu toute sa vie au milieu des livres, et rêve d’aventure. Il décidera de suivre Illyne dans sa quête et découvrira que l’aventure est bien plus facile dans les livres.




Kalann est le fils adoptif d’un marchand des mers, reconverti en pilleur de tombe. Ayant grandi au milieu des marins et ayant fréquenté les tavernes depuis son plus jeune âge, il est fougueux, blagueur et séducteur.  


Qui est l'auteur ?


Alors qui je suis ? Hey bien je m'appelle Johann BLAIS (aka Papayou), jeune concept artist et directeur artistique, je travaille pour le jeux vidéo et le cinéma depuis 2010.



J'ai eu la chance de travailler sur des projets tels que Game of Thrones RPG de Cyanide Studio, ou encore des films tels que Thor, The Darkest Hour, ou encore le Marsupilami.  

Vous pouvez me suivre sur Facebook et Twitter pour plus d'informations. 





Mes motivations 





Je rêve depuis longtemps de me lancer dans la grande aventure que peut être la création d'une bande dessinée.
Et là vous vous demandez : pourquoi faire çà via une plateforme de crowdfunding ? Et bien parce qu'au delà d'une simple BD je souhaite pouvoir proposer un contenu vraiment complet sur ce que peut être Illyne et proposer quelque chose de différent de l'édition classique.
C'est pourquoi j'ai choisi cette méthode qui (je l'espère) si le financement atteint son objectif, me permettra de vous proposer le premier Tome d'Illyne ainsi qu'un artbook qui traitera de l'univers, des personnages, et des légendes du vaste monde qui accueille les aventures de notre protagoniste, accompagné de croquis de recherche, et différents concept art.
En plus de çà, je vous proposerai de petits bonus, tels que des lithographie au tirage limité qui je l'espère sauront trouver intéret à vos yeux.
Toutefois, pour pouvoir vous proposer un prix proche des tarifs pratiqués en librairie, je dois réunir une somme assez conséquente qui me permettra de lancer d'importants tirages des œuvres pour que les coûts de productions soient intéressants. 
Voila, vous savez à peu près tout de ce qui me motive dans cette nouvelle aventure qui ne verra le jour que si elle suscite votre intérêt à vous aussi. Intérêt que vous pouvez manifester (en plus de préacheter les livres =) en diffusant un maximum la page de ce projet. 
Ce n'est que grâce à vous que tout ça pourra voir le jour.

- Les packs de contreparties ! -








- Les dédicaces avec dessin commencent à partir de ce pack -                                (hormis le pack à 100€)

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello and welcome to my first Indiegogo campaign!  If you've never heard of it, <a href=""http://aliendice.com/blog/2001/05/16/05162001/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alien Dice </a>begins here and as of March 17th, has been online for 12 years!  I've been successful on other platforms with other projects, but this one's a little different.  This one is to fund my work on Alien Dice for the next six months, dedicating 20 hours a week to ONLY Alien Dice related work.  Right now, I tend to only work on the comic in rotation with several others, meaning that often by the end of the week I run out of time.  Succeeding with this funding run would improve my ability to work in general at the cost of a few of my pet projects for awhile.  I have a difficult time deciding on what to do or not to do, so I'm going to leave it up to my readers.  <s> The comic will continue as usual, except for color, if it fails.  You will get larger updates though and the text will be current again with the sacrifice of color. If it fails, you will still have the opportunity to continue color updates simply by getting the monthly goal's current and keeping them there.  <br/></s></p>
<p>If it fails, updates drop to one full color page a week.  I don't want to suddenly change formats like that.  When the tally is current, there will be more updates.</p>
<p>So how much am I asking?  I've been getting along on $300 a month on two comic worlds.  That's $20 a day, which goes to groceries, gas, medical bills, and work supplies.  For a family of 3, that's fine… except that for the past several months it's been $300 total.  Because I am frugal/coupon clipper/bargain finder, we get by, barely.  Just enough to keep heads up… that was until insurance turned horrible in an effort to keep current in all bills and now it's going to go up and my insulin is not cheap.  It's also not good when I need a completely DIFFERENT diet from my family.  Believe it or not, healthy food is not always healthy for diabetics and it is a bit more costly to make 'natural' lower carb items for myself over the cheap processed stuff.</p>
<p>NONE of this will go to ANYTHING fun (unless it's tagged that way).  We don't drink, smoke or waste money on anything like that.  Saves a lot of money to not be able to really drink alcohol, even though I do enjoy Honey Mead on rare occasion and Fruity Korean wines… which are all cheap. :D :D  I think once a year we indulge.</p>
<p>So, how much is my time worth?  Less than minimum wage apparently, when it comes to online comics.  $300 at 20 hours a week = 80 hours = $3.75.  Minimum wage is $7.25. I'm asking for $5.00 an hour.  So that'd be a little bit nicer  $400 a month.  This also takes care of the last couple of months of shortage.  Total amount: $2,400 for six months of putting Alien Dice FIRST for 20 hours a week, that is, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday to noon, BEFORE I even THINK about another comic.  That means, comic work, site redesign, removing banner and box ads, fixing the FULL page archive for all the enjoy up to current, uploading the Radio Play episodes to a new area, SCRIPTING, laying out the 250 page graphic novels *shudder*, figuring out how to properly convert RGB to CMYK and it does NOT mean… trying to think of new things to do monthly and running monthly fund runs.  Taxes come directly out of that amount and don't need to be figured as extra.  (Note… I pay 2X Social Security tax, as do all people who work for themselves.)</p>
<p>I get one week of vacation and I can miss three updates in case of illness/child illness, etc.  If I miss more, the offer is pushed out that many updates beyond the initial six months.</p>
<p> Now, let's go on to the things I'm offering to get to this goal!  But first, for INTERNATIONAL SUPPORTERS!  Your currency is worth more than ours, but more times than not, shipping is way too high, especially now.  To make up for that, you will be getting a complimentary inked art card of a character of your choice with your chosen items.  You only have to add the extra ONCE per your entire selection and everyone is free to add items together, but if you're adding them to a limited tier, select the limited tier!!  To be fair, you can add an inked (b&amp;w) card to any tier for $6. </p>
<p>Please note, you CAN do multiple tiers seperately!</p>
<p><strong>Swiftpaw Exclusive Perk!</strong>  This story will be available online for supporters and you can choose any amount to be a supporter and EVERYONE will get to see it as it's done.  This is a short 15 page black and white story featuring Swiftpaw's conversion from a chicken stealing fox into the one we all know and love!</p>
<p><img alt=""charms"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://shivae.net/images/Charms.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Charms!""/><strong>Taco Perk!</strong>- You don't want anything, but would like to let me enjoy something.  I am allowed to buy tacos.  (Tacos = actual tacos, groceries and maybe something fun like a movie for all of us once the goal is met.. But at LEAST one order of tacos shall be consumed.</p>
<p><strong>CHARMS!</strong>  We have a new set of three charms featuring, Fluffy, Fluffy, and SIPHON, the vampire duck! - 100 charms cost me $165 + shipping  They are available for $6 each, which includes shipping in the US.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""buttons"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://shivae.net/images/buttons2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>BUTTONS!</strong> I have new professional button machines and am putting them to use!  Designs will be up soon, but the three charm designs plus two others are available as 2.25"" buttons, keychains and mirrors or 1.25"" buttons, keychains, cellstraps, etc. On these, you can also request pre-existing art, but not a commission.</p>
<p>By the Piece add to other orders or pick up a bundle in the tiers.</p>
<ul>
<li>2.25"" Pinback buttons - $2 each</li>
<li>2.25"" Keychain button - $3 each.  Image on one side.</li>
<li>2.25"" Mirror button - $5 each (come with an organza bag.)  Image is one side, mirror on the other.</li>
<li>1.25"" pinback button - $1 each.</li>
<li>1.25"" keychain/zipper pull/cellphone charm/necklace pendant - $2</li>
<li>1.25"" magnet - $2</li>
</ul><p><strong>CUSTOM Mirror Button Commissions! </strong> Hand drawn or digital images done on 2.24"" mirrors.  You can even choose images from the comic to be redrawn as button images.  These designs will be made available to others as well, but you'll get the original art with them.  - $15  You can request button commissions on all of the above mentioned item by adding $10 to the cost of the button for 2.25"" ones and $5 for the 1.25"" ones.  You can commission one and then have the image duplicated over other buttons and charms for the price of the button.  So you can do one commission and then get half a dozen buttons with the same design made from print.  Please let me know if it's ok to replicate your design myself for sale in other venues!</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor a Character! </strong> I am OFTEN asked to draw group pictures of all the dice, but rarely have reason to just draw dice when there is comic work to be done.  So for $10, you can sponsor a dice, pick the level and he/she will be drawn for the website , for uploading to a new dice section of the site, and printing in a Dice book.   Sides 1-3 will be drawn on my favorite copic paper and for $10 more, will be hand colored.  (Each will be roughly 4.5 x 5.5 in size.)  Sides 4-6 will be done on 5.5 x 8 paper and coloring will be $15 more.  Regardless, you will get the original art AND a print of the finished piece mailed to you for the base $10.  <strong>Slots will be limited to TWO only of each level and only the main six dice, Stealth, Zeta, Fly, Skate, Drift and Swiftpaw.  (This time.) (oh oops - Drift AND Swiftpaw have 8 levels!)<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Taken so far:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Swiftpaw - </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>S4 (1)</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong><img alt=""Stealth card"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://shivae.net/images/Stealth.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Artist Card and Art Book! </strong> Full color ACEOs (3.5 x 2.5 hand drawn, inked and colored with copics and watercolors featuring the character of your choice.)  There is a limit of 40 of these and I have not decided how they will be compiled into a book, but they will be shown actual size.  I'm thinking either a 12 page comic book or 24 page manga size book... or I may just print them out and bind them myself.  Card and book is $30, which includes shipping in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Dice!</strong>  Last, is the custom laser engraved six sided die.  The plan is for a swirly red and black die with gold engraving and the words: NOT FAIR! Replacing the 1 side and Stealth's head facing forward on the six side.  100 of these is $120.  Customized dice are not cheap. :D   But they are also going to be limited to ONLY how many are ordered +20. (the extra 20 will go up for future prizes.)  It's an Indiegogo exclusive.  Yes, I'm aware dice are cheap.  I'm also aware that each die costs $1.20 (It's 60 cents for each engraved side), so putting up a tier for one of them for $3, including shipping, doesn't leave me with much profit.  Of course, this is also what typically gets me in trouble, because I would LIKE my readers who do NOT have lots of extra money to be able to get something they really want.  This was why, for the longest time, I stopped running incentives.  The FIRST 10 dice will be $3.  I figured that'd make me feel good. :) Please don't snag one of these if you can go by the regular price of $5 for one die.</p>
<p><strong>Patron!</strong> - You love to see me doing what I love to do and you love what I'm doing and you want to support it!  This level gets you a FULL 9 x 12 inked commission as well as a listing on the Patron page. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cost of materials:</strong> Charms - $175. 40 ACEO books $2 a book = $80. 100 Dice - $120 = ($375.00)  I have plenty of supplies for all the rest of the projects.</p>
<p><strong> Total Funding needed:</strong></p>
<p> Salary: $2,400</p>
<p>Supplies: $375</p>
<p>Shipping costs: $1,500</p>
<p>Fees - 10%: $430</p>
<p>Safety Net to round it.  $295</p>
<p><strong>2400 + 375 + 1500 + 430 = 4705 + 295 = 5000</strong></p>
<p> <strong>Stretch Goals!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/>$5,150</strong> - Those who request a Stealth dice will get TWO dice instead of 1.  Number cap will be REMOVED!</p>
<p> <strong>$ 5,300 - Zeta Die </strong> - Orange and gold swirly dice like flames with gold or black engraving of Zeta's head on the six side. </p>
<p><strong>$ 6,000 -</strong> Comic Details Upgrade - I will go from cel shading to soft shading with more time spent on the art itself .  More time will be spent on it to begin with, but I will force myself to slow down and let myself enjoy it more.</p>
<p><strong>$ 7,000 -</strong> Swiftpaw Exclusive will be in color.</p>
<p> Patronage BEYOND the initial goal will all go into savings to keep on top of our medical bills, do away with debt related to her heart surgeries and then go into savings for a house down payment so that we can stop renting and get in a better tax bracket. :D </p>
<p>I don't have any expectations on it, but I do hope this all goes well.</p>
<p>Edit 4/14:  Small note.  After my dental visit yesterday, I was informed I have lost 50-75% of my bone mass and ALL 32 of my barely bigger than baby teeth need to be removed.  Only thing holding them in is tarter below the gumline.  And no, my mouth does not look like the horrific ones they show in textbooks.  Yippee.  So many factors with genetics being #1.  Luckily, I have dental insurance, which is why I was at the dentist. :D  I've been quoted $1,800 - so some of this will be directed into my mouth.</p>

Sponsor a Character!  I am OFTEN asked to draw group pictures of all the dice, but rarely have reason to just draw dice when there is comic work to be done.  So for $10, you can sponsor a dice, pick the level and he/she will be drawn for the website , for uploading to a new dice section of the site, and printing in a Dice book.   Sides 1-3 will be drawn on my favorite copic paper and for $10 more, will be hand colored.  (Each will be roughly 4.5 x 5.5 in size.)  Sides 4-6 will be done on 5.5 x 8 paper and coloring will be $15 more.  Regardless, you will get the original art AND a print of the finished piece mailed to you for the base $10.  Slots will be limited to TWO only of each level and only the main six dice, Stealth, Zeta, Fly, Skate, Drift and Swiftpaw.  (This time.) (oh oops - Drift AND Swiftpaw have 8 levels!)
Taken so far:
Swiftpaw - 

S4 (1)
Artist Card and Art Book!  Full color ACEOs (3.5 x 2.5 hand drawn, inked and colored with copics and watercolors featuring the character of your choice.)  There is a limit of 40 of these and I have not decided how they will be compiled into a book, but they will be shown actual size.  I'm thinking either a 12 page comic book or 24 page manga size book... or I may just print them out and bind them myself.  Card and book is $30, which includes shipping in the US.
Custom Dice!  Last, is the custom laser engraved six sided die.  The plan is for a swirly red and black die with gold engraving and the words: NOT FAIR! Replacing the 1 side and Stealth's head facing forward on the six side.  100 of these is $120.  Customized dice are not cheap. :D   But they are also going to be limited to ONLY how many are ordered +20. (the extra 20 will go up for future prizes.)  It's an Indiegogo exclusive.  Yes, I'm aware dice are cheap.  I'm also aware that each die costs $1.20 (It's 60 cents for each engraved side), so putting up a tier for one of them for $3, including shipping, doesn't leave me with much profit.  Of course, this is also what typically gets me in trouble, because I would LIKE my readers who do NOT have lots of extra money to be able to get something they really want.  This was why, for the longest time, I stopped running incentives.  The FIRST 10 dice will be $3.  I figured that'd make me feel good. :) Please don't snag one of these if you can go by the regular price of $5 for one die.
Patron! - You love to see me doing what I love to do and you love what I'm doing and you want to support it!  This level gets you a FULL 9 x 12 inked commission as well as a listing on the Patron page. :)
 
Cost of materials: Charms - $175. 40 ACEO books $2 a book = $80. 100 Dice - $120 = ($375.00)  I have plenty of supplies for all the rest of the projects.
 Total Funding needed:
 Salary: $2,400
Supplies: $375
Shipping costs: $1,500
Fees - 10%: $430
Safety Net to round it.  $295
2400 + 375 + 1500 + 430 = 4705 + 295 = 5000
 Stretch Goals!
$5,150 - Those who request a Stealth dice will get TWO dice instead of 1.  Number cap will be REMOVED!
 $ 5,300 - Zeta Die  - Orange and gold swirly dice like flames with gold or black engraving of Zeta's head on the six side. 
$ 6,000 - Comic Details Upgrade - I will go from cel shading to soft shading with more time spent on the art itself .  More time will be spent on it to begin with, but I will force myself to slow down and let myself enjoy it more.
$ 7,000 - Swiftpaw Exclusive will be in color.
 Patronage BEYOND the initial goal will all go into savings to keep on top of our medical bills, do away with debt related to her heart surgeries and then go into savings for a house down payment so that we can stop renting and get in a better tax bracket. :D 
I don't have any expectations on it, but I do hope this all goes well.
Edit 4/14:  Small note.  After my dental visit yesterday, I was informed I have lost 50-75% of my bone mass and ALL 32 of my barely bigger than baby teeth need to be removed.  Only thing holding them in is tarter below the gumline.  And no, my mouth does not look like the horrific ones they show in textbooks.  Yippee.  So many factors with genetics being #1.  Luckily, I have dental insurance, which is why I was at the dentist. :D  I've been quoted $1,800 - so some of this will be directed into my mouth.

By supporting this campaign and seeing it funded, you are helping UTMNT continue for the next issue! It will also lock in Eryck in to UTMNT for one full issue as Eryck has gotten extremely busy due to his hard work and talent and is very-much in-demand!
We believe we have some decent perks too for those who can contribute. The challenge is (as you will read below) is that the art is the book and always comes first. Without that, we can't do any other rewards or perks.

By helping this project become funded, you help secure Eryck Webb as the talent and time for this amazing project.Besides creating an awesome fan-based webcomic of our favorite bipedal ninja-based terrapins, we have what we hope are some pretty neato-cheato perks !

<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>""Return of the French Guy"" started out as a feature-length sequel to ""The Unwritten Rule Trilogy"", a series of Star Wars fan films we made back in 2003 and 2004. It started out as just a single film - ""Shotgun"" - but we enjoyed making it so much and it was so well received by our friends and the fan film community that we were compelled to make more. By the time we completed ""Ex"", the third part in the trilogy, we already had ideas for a two-hour epic that would explore the questions we'd always avoided - who were these guys? How can they use the Force? Where did they get lightsabers? What the hell is going on?! ""Return of the French Guy"" was meant to answer those questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were in our final years of university and our coursework had to take priority. Once we graduated, life just sort of swept us away from one another, and despite a deep desire to tell this story, we missed our window. So for the past few years we've been trying to figure out an alternative way of telling this story that doesn't require taking a few months off work to shoot a film. A couple of years ago we realised that it would make an amazing episodic story, and a graphic novel/comic was the perfect fit.</p>
<p>We began rewriting the script to fit a 4-6 panel format designed to be released in biweekly instalments, but we still had one fundamental problem: we can’t draw! So we started searching for artists who would design the characters and create a library of assets that we could use to piece each page together ourselves. Some very kind and talented artists donated their time and efforts to this endeavour, but it was impossible to get them as invested in the project as we wanted them to be. So despite the best of intentions, that idea ultimately failed.</p>
<p>And then crowd funding happened.</p>
<p>BOOM! It was everywhere! And suddenly this story that we'd been trying to tell for years and had all but given up on, suddenly and unexpectedly had one last hope.</p>
<p>Recruiting an amazing artist in Abel Garcia, we took to Indiegogo to fund the first issue, offering some amazing rewards to our backers. The campaign was a massive success, giving us the funds we needed to fully complete issue 1 and start releasing it for free on our website!</p>
<h2>SO WHAT NOW?</h2>
<p>Now we want to make issue 2, and we <strong>need your help</strong> to do it!</p>

This is a 28 page full colour comic book with stunning artwork and a great, original story inspired by Star Wars and superhero mythology; the second of 5 issues making up graphic novel “Return of the French Guy”.
Unlikely Jedi answers the question every Star Wars fan asks: ""what would you do if the Force was real?""

WHAT’S IT ABOUT?
The first chapter in the story of the Unlikely Jedi comic is called ""Return of the French Guy"", which tells the story of three friends in the real world who just happen to be Jedi! The narrative jumps back and forth between the life-changing events surrounding their Force-powered ‘awakening’ and the present day, where they are forced to confront the mistakes of the past and struggle through conflict and hilarity to find their place in a world that will never understand them.
WHERE CAN I READ ISSUE 1?
Issue 1 is available over on our website UNLIKELYJEDI.COM. Once we finished issue 1 we started releasing it page by page twice a week while we waited for the printers to get it into the hands of our backers. Head on over there to catch up on the story!

HISTORY
""Return of the French Guy"" started out as a feature-length sequel to ""The Unwritten Rule Trilogy"", a series of Star Wars fan films we made back in 2003 and 2004. It started out as just a single film - ""Shotgun"" - but we enjoyed making it so much and it was so well received by our friends and the fan film community that we were compelled to make more.

How can they use the Force? Where did they get lightsabers? What the hell is going on?! ""Return of the French Guy"" was meant to answer those questions.
Unfortunately, we were in our final years of university and our coursework had to take priority. Once we graduated, life just sort of swept us away from one another, and despite a deep desire to tell this story, we missed our window.

<h3>Who are you? What is this?!</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Stephen Gillan</strong>, and I make a comic called <strong>Antics</strong>! Antics is a twice-weekly comedy strip about two guys called Fletcher (green tie) and Copernicus (red tie), and their hilarious adventures and general life experiences. You can read Antics online for free, at <a href=""http://www.anticscomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.anticscomic.com</a></p>
<p>I live in New Zealand, but most of my readership is half a planet away! The aim of this campaign is to raise enough money to order a bulk shipment of both Antics print collections (""Cause for Concern"", and the ALL-NEW ""Hot Lava Mud Bath""), so that I am able to offer Artist Edition (signed and sketched in) books for sale worldwide at an affordable price!</p>
<p>I love making this strip, and it is my dream to one day make comics my full-time profession. By supporting this project, you will be helping me take the next step toward making this a career.  It will also help me branch out into providing a better variety of products for my readers. Plus you'll get some great perks for donating (let's not forget that part)!</p>
<p><img alt=""The fancy book covers for volumes 1 and 2 of Antics"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.anticscomic.com/comics/igg_covers.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The fancy book covers for volumes 1 and 2 of Antics!""/></p>
<h3>What exactly am I contributing to?</h3>
<p>I've been selling the first volume of Antics strips for a little over a year now, and lots of people have asked about buying Artist Edition copies. This is a little difficult however, as I live in New Zealand, and most of my audience lives in the US (or other distant lands)! I would need to purchase thousands of copies up front in order to make shipping worldwide affordable for regular copies of these books, and I just don't have that much money. As it stands right now, every copy bought is printed and shipped from within the US, so I never even get the CHANCE to sign/sketch in them.</p>
<p>But now I'm looking to change that! I am still a while away from being able to afford thousands of books to sell regular copies of. But with your help I'm hoping to raise enough money to buy several hundred, and have them delivered right to my doorstep. From there, I'll be able to sell Artist Edition copies of both books direct from the Antics website (including worldwide shipping) at a reasonable price!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Tell me about these ""perk"" things, already!</h3>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ALSO</strong> - If things go REALLY well, I have some stretch goals in mind for this campaign. But let's not count our chickens before they hatch!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Can I buy REGULAR copies of the books?</h3>
<p>You sure can! I haven't included plain copies of either book in the reward tiers, because I won't be shipping them myself! The price to ship to me, and THEN overseas is a little too restrictive. Regular copies are (and will continue to be) shipped directly from IndyPlanet. ""Cause for Concern"" (volume 1) can be bought <a href=""http://indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=6103"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Antics volume 1: buy from IndyPlanet!"">here</a>, and ""Hot Lava Mud Bath"" (volume 2) will be available at a later date. However, it will be AFTER all of the Artist Edition copies from this campaign have shipped, to be nice to everyone who has preordered.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What about me? I have no money!</h3>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that, but you can definitely still help! Indiegogo has a bunch of built-in tools (located at the top of this wall of text) for sharing this campaign with your friends and family! Or if you don't like using buttons, you can just spread this link around: <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/antics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.indiegogo.com/antics</a></p>
<p>Whether you are an avid reader of Antics, or you just want to see an independent cartoonist succeed, it will mean the world to me if you can help me promote this campaign!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What difference will my support make?</h3>
<p>I hope that with the continued support of fans, I can turn this comic into something that brings thousands of people around the world the moments of excitement and happiness that make comics great!</p>
<p>I've been making Antics for almost 4 years now, and I feel like I'm only improving over time. If I can eventually make enough money to produce comics full-time, I can dedicate myself to getting better and better, and producing even more comics (and other content) for my readers to enjoy.</p>
<p>With your help, I can take another step along the road toward making Antics a career, and toward making every Antics strip the best little cartoon it can be!</p>

Alright, fine! No need to yell. There are a whole bunch of physical/intangible items available in this campaign. Here are some slightly more detailed descriptions of the rewards currently up for grabs:


Antics wallpapers - These three wallpapers will be available exclusively as part of this campaign! Each one is a stirring pictorial tribute to Fletcher, Copernicus and (*shudder*) Jeff.

 


Antics digital sampler - A campaign-exclusive, 20 page PDF featuring my personal top ten Antics strips! Each one is accompanied by my handwritten thoughts on the strip, and assorted strip-related doodles!

 


""Cause for Concern"" PDF - The PDF versions of Antics volume 1 is web resolution only, but contains the same bonus content as the physical book. That means you get a fancy collection of comics, plus a bunch of extra illustrations and sketches! SCORE!

 


""Cause for Concern"" (Antics volume 1): Artist Edition - A full color, 104 page collection of Antics comic strips! Featuring sky whales, submarine crashes, zombies and much more. Contains book-exclusive illustrations and sketches! Signed and sketched inside the front cover, by yours truly!

 


""Hot Lava Mud Bath"" (Antics volume 2): Artist Edition- A full color, 124 page collection of Antics comics strips! Featuring magical hippos, insane people in biplanes, and hideous snake beasts from another dimension. Contains book-exclusive illustrations, sketches and minicomics! Signed and sketched inside the front cover, by yours truly!

 


Page o' sketches - An A4 page, chock-full of random sketches and doodlings! Sketches will be done in pen, so there's no risk of them smudging away to nothing during transit! Your sketch page will be shipped along with your books.

 


Original minicomic art - The original artwork from a previously published collection of 4 Antics minicomics! WARNING: these things aren't perfect; they may contain ""original"" mistakes as well! Slightly under A4 size. You will receive a random set of 4 three-panel minicomics, which will be shipped along with your books!

 


Custom minicomics - A page of 4 three-panel minicomics, each based on a word of your choosing! Just include 4 random words in the ""comment"" section when you claim this perk. Or if you can't be bothered, simply leave it blank, and I'll pick the words for you! I will send you the original art (slightly under A4 size) along with your books, and email you high and low-resolution versions of the comics. You can see some previous minicomic examples here, here and here.

 


Custom comic strip - A page-long, full color comic strip, based on a phrase of your choosing! Examples include ""hippo on a skateboard"" or ""robot space patrol"". Just include your desired phrase in the ""comment"" section when you claim this perk. Or if you can't be bothered, leave it blank and I'll choose a phrase for you! You will recieve a small printed copy along with your books, as well as both high and low-resolution digital copies sent to your email address. You can see some previous custom comic examples on this page.

 


Hand-drawn Antics REMIXXX - Just pick your favorite published Antics strip, and I'll send you your own redrawn, personalised A4-sized copy! I will pencil, ink and color it by hand, then it will be signed and shipped to you along with your books! Simply include the name + number of the strip you would like in the ""comment"" section when you claim this perk.

 


The Big Kahuna - Includes all items from the Digital Deluxe perk, Artist Edition copy of both Antics volumes, a page of sketches, a page of custom minicomics, a page of original minicomic art, a custom comic strip, AND a hand-drawn Antics strip of your choosing! All digital files will be emailed to you, AND sent along with your items on a fancy USB drive, along with a video message of thanks from me! Please refer to other perk listings for the details of individual perks. Don't worry about including request details in the ""comment"" section when claiming this perk; I'll contact you to get the necessary information for your enormous pile of customized items!

 


ALSO - If things go REALLY well, I have some stretch goals in mind for this campaign. But let's not count our chickens before they hatch!

 
Can I buy REGULAR copies of the books?
You sure can! I haven't included plain copies of either book in the reward tiers, because I won't be shipping them myself! The price to ship to me, and THEN overseas is a little too restrictive. Regular copies are (and will continue to be) shipped directly from IndyPlanet. ""Cause for Concern"" (volume 1) can be bought here, and ""Hot Lava Mud Bath"" (volume 2) will be available at a later date. However, it will be AFTER all of the Artist Edition copies from this campaign have shipped, to be nice to everyone who has preordered.
 
What about me? I have no money!
I'm sorry to hear that, but you can definitely still help! Indiegogo has a bunch of built-in tools (located at the top of this wall of text) for sharing this campaign with your friends and family! Or if you don't like using buttons, you can just spread this link around: www.indiegogo.com/antics
Whether you are an avid reader of Antics, or you just want to see an independent cartoonist succeed, it will mean the world to me if you can help me promote this campaign!
 
What difference will my support make?
I hope that with the continued support of fans, I can turn this comic into something that brings thousands of people around the world the moments of excitement and happiness that make comics great!
I've been making Antics for almost 4 years now, and I feel like I'm only improving over time. If I can eventually make enough money to produce comics full-time, I can dedicate myself to getting better and better, and producing even more comics (and other content) for my readers to enjoy.
With your help, I can take another step along the road toward making Antics a career, and toward making every Antics strip the best little cartoon it can be!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>THE PLAN</b></h3>
<p><b>Remastering THE DISSIDENT in Full Color!</b></p>
<p>Originally printed under the title “XXX” by Dark Horse Comics in the mid-90s, we intended the series to be colored, but due to budget cutbacks it was released only in black and white. The 336-page narrative was written and visually researched over two years while living in Amsterdam and takes place in many historical Dutch locations. We recently obtained the original scans of the pages and now plan to fully remaster and color every page the way they were originally meant to be published, and make the comic available for everyone to read online for free throughout 2016!</p>
<p><b>Before and After!</b></p>
<p>We have been creating color tests and are thrilled to see how much life is being brought to the pages, and a sense of being transported into the streets of Amsterdam. Here are a few examples in progress.</p>

<p>Do you love 80's horror movies and comic books? Then you've come to the right place!</p>
<p>Body Trade is a <strong>48+ page horror-themed comic</strong> with the visual styling of an old <strong>Tales from the Crypt comic</strong> and a story that will take you back to the campy fun days of 80's horror <strong>(Slumber Party Massacre / Re-Animator/ Return of the Living Dead / Big Trouble in Little China / etc).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Body Trade is Horror as Horror should be with uncompromising attention to detail and quality! The artwork speaks for itself, go on and look, it's okay. </strong>*Note: If we do not fully fund, we will reimburse all backers!*</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569197472/mjhmqveagrbyfpqasw8j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The black market Body Trade is a dirty business - but a VERY lucrative one! Like a car, the human body is worth more when it is ""parted out"" - and this is exactly what our girls find out when they accidentally kill a man and need to dispose of the body.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570925252/leijzq85huwz8ae0lcdl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>TONE:</strong></p>
<p>The over the top nature of the premise lends itself to going for gore, gore, gore so that's the direction we have gone with the comic version of BT. Movie comparison wise, I'd say it's Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 meets a Tales from the Crypt episode -- TCM2 for the ""over the top"" horror and Tales from the Crypt for the cheeky humor.</p>
<p>The premise is played straight and isn't made light of, however as you will read below, the girls do seriously underestimate the seriousness of the situation they have gotten themselves into.</p>
<p><strong>RATING:</strong></p>
<p>While the premise of Body Trade is very Mature, the actual comic itself would be <strong>rated an</strong> <strong>R by movie standards. There isn't any nudity or sex in the comic</strong> -- just gore, lingerie and strong language. I'd say it's no worse than the walking dead comic for violence and language.</p>
<p><strong>STORY:</strong></p>
<p>The story picks up fairly quickly with the girls (Dancers/Hookers) accidentally killing a man and while trying to find a way to cover up the death learn of the lucrative black market for body parts.</p>
<p>Given the nature of their business, it is almost too good to pass up -- Tons of male tourists who won't be missed and sleazy men who ""deserve"" what they get.</p>
<p>Through a tissue donation business front, the girls find quick success and bite off way more than they can chew. However, the demand is never ending so they quickly expand and begin to make money hand over fist.</p>
<p>What our ladies don't count on are the risks of the trade, especially as they begin to draw too much attention to themselves. With success comes trouble, and the trouble the girls face is two fold -- A detective and a rival black market ""gang"". Who will get to the girls first? Will the girls make it out unscathed? Will their business be short lived? find out in volume one of Body Trade - Risky Business!</p>
<p>The story climaxes (pun intended) with a potentially disastrous turn of events that will drastically change how the girls survive their new business venture.</p>

Body Trade is a 48+ page horror-themed comic with the visual styling of an old Tales from the Crypt comic and a story that will take you back to the campy fun days of 80's horror (Slumber Party Massacre / Re-Animator/ Return of the Living Dead / Big Trouble in Little China / etc).
Body Trade is Horror as Horror should be with uncompromising attention to detail and quality! The artwork speaks for itself, go on and look, it's okay. *Note: If we do not fully fund, we will reimburse all backers!*

The black market Body Trade is a dirty business - but a VERY lucrative one! Like a car, the human body is worth more when it is ""parted out"" - and this is exactly what our girls find out when they accidentally kill a man and need to dispose of the body.

TONE:
The over the top nature of the premise lends itself to going for gore, gore, gore so that's the direction we have gone with the comic version of BT. Movie comparison wise, I'd say it's Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 meets a Tales from the Crypt episode -- TCM2 for the ""over the top"" horror and Tales from the Crypt for the cheeky humor.
The premise is played straight and isn't made light of, however as you will read below, the girls do seriously underestimate the seriousness of the situation they have gotten themselves into.
RATING:
While the premise of Body Trade is very Mature, the actual comic itself would be rated an R by movie standards. There isn't any nudity or sex in the comic -- just gore, lingerie and strong language. I'd say it's no worse than the walking dead comic for violence and language.
STORY:
The story picks up fairly quickly with the girls (Dancers/Hookers) accidentally killing a man and while trying to find a way to cover up the death learn of the lucrative black market for body parts.
Given the nature of their business, it is almost too good to pass up -- Tons of male tourists who won't be missed and sleazy men who ""deserve"" what they get.
Through a tissue donation business front, the girls find quick success and bite off way more than they can chew. However, the demand is never ending so they quickly expand and begin to make money hand over fist.
What our ladies don't count on are the risks of the trade, especially as they begin to draw too much attention to themselves. With success comes trouble, and the trouble the girls face is two fold -- A detective and a rival black market ""gang"". Who will get to the girls first? Will the girls make it out unscathed? Will their business be short lived? find out in volume one of Body Trade - Risky Business!
The story climaxes (pun intended) with a potentially disastrous turn of events that will drastically change how the girls survive their new business venture.

We need your support to produce this innovative comic book. This project is a labor of love ten years in the making. What started as a web series, then a feature script has evolved into a dream comic that we want to share with you!

All funds raised are going towards printing costs, adding pages, high quality paper stock, and paying the talented artist. Should we pass the funding and stretch goals, we will get into the trading cards and posters.
Before Stretch Goals, here's what you get: 
48-pages, saddle stitched, crimson colored comic
Once we get to Stretch Goals, each PHYSICAL backer will receive the following EXTRAS as we pass our goal:


24K DOUBLE FEATURE BOOST 
A brand new comic added (See below)
The Abaddon (48 pages) 


POSTER BOOST?
TRADING CARD BOOST?
MORE WILL BE ANNOUNCED ONCE WE GET THERE

At 24K we will unlock this brand new comic and INCLUDE it with your shipment. 
The Abaddon Anthology is a 48 page comic about a motel run by the devil. Guests check in and are faced with their worst fears. Some are there to learn a lesson, others are there to take a ticket to hell. You can only ""see"" the hotel if you're in need of a visit!
There are 2 stories in this volume with a wrap around story featuring the ""Devil Lady"" you see below. 

This cannot be done without YOU. We either make the amount needed to produce this or we reimburse every backer and try again another time.
I've been at this project for 10 years, minus a little break for the family. Now is the time to bring not one but 2 amazing horror comics to life!
The biggest risk will be the raise itself. Once we are funded it will take roughly 4 months to complete the art, then another month to print and fulfill the orders.
We will run the campaign for up to 60 days, which is the maximum allowed to try to fully fund this. Once again, if we don't raise the required amount to produce this, we will refund all orders.
Once funded, should anything arise during printing or shipping, we will be quick to alert you and update you frequently on the progress every step of the way. Nothing to hide here at all.

The more people that back this, the more rewards you get. Simple as that!
Once you've backed please share a link via social media to anyone you feel will also like this project. Lets get more pages and better stock. Lets get a brand new comic added!",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

Detective Burbon. Another. Issue 1
Hello everyone.
What is our comic about? It's about Twin City police detective. The detective's
without any code of conduct, manners and with his own view of good and evil. He
has an unloved wife an a son who he loves a lot.  Probably he's the only person he loves. Our
cop can kill easily, break the law if it's needed. He's rude, impetuous, smokes
a lot and always hits the first. However, he has good crime detection and is
put up with at work, but he should have been fired long time ago.
This comic is the
first pilot issue. Everyone who's interested in detectives with a lot  of violence, shootings, cruelty and cynicism,
who's interested in complicated detective's investigations with black humour,
marked 18+ are advised to read it.



Where the Money Goes

Why do we need
money?
The only thing we
need money for is printing out 300 copies in a printing office. As it's going
to be all in color, the printing is quite expensive. You give us money, we
print out the comic, and you get a unique novel.
Why don't we say
anything except the printing?
The fact is, we
have already created a part of the comic for our own money and we're going to
make it further. We're artists and have a lot of paints and paper. We don't
need employees, we only need the money for the printing office. That's all!
What will it be in
the end?
21х30 cm. - book size.
100-120 fully colored pages.




Help us create our
hero's story and, who knows, maybe he'll be able to become a worthy
contemporary character. We were inspired by the film  Bad Lieutenant with Harvey Keitel starring to
create the comic. We thought why there are so many good characters but so few
negative ones. So with your help we'll be able to redress this injustice.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

 you're not familiar with the series and are here afresh, this began as 
something of a lark when I wrote a fake spoilerific review of the Dark 
Knight Rises weeks before its release. The review was accompanied by journalistic coverage of the 2012 San Diego Comic

article was to irk my editor and start a flame war with the site's 
readers. Instead, the article was an instant success and readers were 
clamoring for more as was my editor.</p><p>So I began to develop further
 stories set at different film festivals and major media events that 
were based on previous personal experiences working with in the film 
world. </p><p>Somehow, things took a twisted turn towards the surreal 
and psychedelic with my first prolonged series of articles/ short 
stories at the 2012 Philadelphia Film Festival. 
Within these articles posing as film journalism, I wrote a serialized 
narrative that was about eighty pages long that featured a one night 
stand with a Craigslist hook up whose vagina served as a portal to 
another dimension. And while I lampooned the local film community and 
wrote about all of the social politics that govern the film festival 
scene, I also had a plot line featuring a demonic Anti-Christ concluding
 with a miniature apocalypse.  </p><p>I think I was the person who was 
the most shocked to find that people genuinely loved those articles. Not
 only did fans find them to be shocking and crazy, but also funny, 
sincere, and somehow poignant. <br/></p><p>My editor at Twitch urged me to 
continue the series and I wrote an even longer and crazier narrative for
 Sundance in 2013. It featured celebrity orgies and terrorist 
conspiracies. And since I’m also an illustrative artist, I finished that
 series with a 12 page comic book. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263596/files/20131216081343-k1.jpg?1387210423"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263597/files/20131216081359-k10.jpg?1387210439"" src="""" style=""""/></p>My later articles for other 
film festivals continued to grow and evolve. What started as a joke 
became something much more ambitious and elaborate. Characters from 
previous stories started to reappear with over-reaching character arcs 
and plot elements that would begin at one festival only to end at 
another an entire year later. 
And as the stories became more outlandish, the themes within them became
 more personal, more grounded, and more emotional. <br/><p></p><p>When I created a series of articles set at the Yubari Film Festival in Japan, I ended up with a sort of Madame Butterfly type love story. Only, this wasn't based on previous works of fiction, it was based on my own personal experiences living in Japan. The articles had major plot lines surrounding the Tokyo fetish porn scene and had sexual encounters with the cursed ghosts of jealous ex- girlfriends, but it was still a serious and heart tugging story of losing your first love. It became one of the darkest things I've ever written as it became a tale about a selfish man refusing to let go, who's unrealistic fantasies of cinematic notions of romance leads him on a violent and self destructive war path that hurts a lot of innocent people and comes with some big consequences. <br/></p><p>During my series set at the Cannes Film Festival, I wrote about my run ins with a deranged serial killer named Mike Dugal.  Mike was an over the top character, a bad horror film director using a psychotropic mind control drug from Colombia to score film deals and victims. But the series was also an honest and sincere deconstruction of  horror explored the many themes of misogyny inherent with in the genre. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263599/files/20131216081427-k8.jpg?1387210467"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263603/files/20131216081500-k9.jpg?1387210500"" src="""" style=""""/></p>My series at the Toronto International Film Festival had corrupt drug dealing cops, bike gang outlaws, and a werewolf. But it was also a tragic tale about the sins of our fathers and the complicated relationships between them and their adult sons. <p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263605/files/20131216081529-k3.jpg?1387210529"" src="""" style=""""/></p>And the less said about the book's conclusion at Fantastic Fest in Austin, the better.  Things get really wild towards the end and I don't want to spoil the surprises. <br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263607/files/20131216081558-k7.jpg?1387210558"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Nearly two 
years since I began all of this, the articles have amassed to a single 380 paged narrative 
with over 60 pages of illustrations. And while there's a wealth of 
information about all of the ins and outs of the film world, the scope 
of the novel is much larger. This isn't just some big inside joke about 
the film world. It has garnered a sizable fan base outside of the usual
 Twitchfilm readership whom have little knowledge or interest in the 
film festival circuit.</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>
</p><p><b>WHY DO I NEED YOUR HELP TO FUND THIS? </b></p><p>The book is
 mostly finished ,and I initially had two major publishers interested in
 printing it. But as conventional print media crawls closer to its 
grave, they ultimately decided that this was too risky and difficult to 
market to a broader audience. 
 I spent a lot of wasteful time pitching the book to other publishers and there 
always seemed to be some inkling of interest. But I realized that finding 
the right publisher to take this on would be a full time job and could easily 
take a year or two. I already have three other serialized novels 
outlined and ready to be written. I'm proud of Pissing in the Punch Bowl
 but am anxious to move on to the next project. <br/></p><p>And that’s beauty
 of Indiegogo, I can reach out directly to my fans and potential
 fans like you, my fellow film, comic, and lit nerd 
brethren. Pissing in the Punch Bowl makes fun of everything you hate and
 It makes fun of everything you love.  You’re going to laugh out loud 
when you read it. You’re going to cringe, and you may just blush and 
have to look over your shoulder to check if anyone is watching you. </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT THIS INDIEGOGO IF YOU'RE  A FAN AND ALREADY READ THE SERIES ONLINE FOR FREE?</b></p><p>Well,
 first off. I never received a single ******* penny for any of it, so 
come on and help a brother out. It’s hard out there for a film writer. </p><p>Second,
 because you’re a nerd and I understand you because I’m a nerd too. You 
like to own things, you like to collect rare and weird things to put in 
your library to show off. This is going to be a beautiful ultra cool 
looking book and it’s going to look great on your book shelf. And it's going to be signed by yours truly.<br/></p><p> 
Third, because there’s a lot more story than what you’ve read.
To this day, I still have fans asking me when and if they’ll be able to read the rest of the Yubari series. </p><p>There’s
 another 70 pages of material, and I think it might be my favorite of 
the whole book. It’s certainly the most personal and possibly the 
darkest.  You’re finally going to get to read that. </p><div>
<div>
<p>And fourth, my online articles were a mess, they’re full of 
typos, grammatical errors, and strange inconsistencies. I was writing 
these things in line with the film festivals as they took place. That 
means that I was often writing one hundred pages of material in a two 
week time span. It’s impossible to professionally edit and proof that 
much content in that amount of time. It’s all being cleaned up now and 
it’s going to read a lot better. </p>
<p>And with your help, I can afford to hire a professional editor who’s going to tune this baby up so that it hums like a Hemmy. </p>
<p>Fifth,
 because you enjoy my writing and art and you want to see more of it. 
The truth about us awful, self centered, narcissistic artists is that we
 crave, nay, need validation. I have tons of new projects in development
 but it's hard to really get the ball rolling on those until I've 
finished this.</p>
<p>
And sixth, the rewards are really really sweet. <br/></p>
<p>You can win original comic page illustrations that were used in the final book.<br/></p>

<h2>
WHY IS THIS SO EXPENSIVE AS COMPARED TO OTHER PUBLISHING INDIE-GOGO PROJECTS FROM FIRST TIME WRITERS?

</h2>
<p>I know that there sure are a lot of other writers on here trying to 
self publish their first novel, and I realize that most of them are only
 asking for $5000 - $10000.</p>
<p>It's kind of scary to be the guy asking for $20,000. But here's the 
thing, self publishing is really expensive. <br/></p>
<p>I'm still in the process of negotiating with my printer but I expect 
the costs to be anywhere from $6000 - $8000 just for the printing. 
Shipping and handling for 1000 books plus all of the heavier rewards for
 the bigger sponsors will be an additional $5000.</p>
<p>I'll also be hiring a copyright editor and professional graphic 
designer for the layout and plan on painting an additional 6 pages while
 also hiring a professional colorist to rescan and polish up the 
original artwork. All of that should cost an additional $2000 - $3000. </p>
<p>Add in a small buffer for misc. unexpected expenditures, and the cost
 for printing 1000 books should end up being around $16,000. Then you 
have to figure in the 5% cut that Indiegogo takes and suddenly $20,000 doesn't sound like so much. Actually, it's still on the low end. <br/></p>
<p>So I really do hope I can even exceed my minimum goal so that I might 
actually make a few dollars for my time and work and the more money that
 I can raise, the better the final product will be. If I can reach 
$30,000, I'll write an additional short story from the perspective of 
one of the novel's most popular characters, Uzi Silverstein. If I can 
reach $40,000, the book will be full of even more outlandish comic book 
artwork. <br/></p>
<p>If I reach $50,000, I'll make hardcover editions available for any sponsors above $75.<br/></p>
<p>Backers need not worry about meeting my requirements. Hey, that's why
 I'm asking for $20,000 right? Everything has been budgeted with a 
comfortable but reasonable buffer so that no one is left standing with 
their bits dangling in the wind. Also, as already stated, the book is 
finished! It just needs a good cover, a strong page layout, and a little
 spit and polish before it hits the printer. I expect to have all of 
that work finished by the end of March so that the books can be printed in April and mailed out in May and June.   There's always a possibility for 
delay but under no circumstances do I expect that to go beyond the end 
of July.</p>
<p>The only other major hold up would be the legal stuff. I am a first 
time self publisher. I'll be paying a copyright 
attorney to clear everything in the book and to make sure that I won't 
run into any weird future lawsuits when this eventually goes up for sale
 on Amazon and it's impossible to gauge what strange issues could arise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>And with that, I really want to thank you for giving me your time to pitch this crazy project of mine. Hopefully, you're a fan of the work. If not, then maybe you will be. Most importantly, I hope that you can support my first novel and help a struggling/starving artist get his work out there without going any further into debt. <br/><br/>Cheers!<br/>Greg Christie<br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/263778/files/20131216095457-Kickstarter_logo.jpg?1387216497"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Only, this wasn't based on previous works of fiction, it was based on my own personal experiences living in Japan. The articles had major plot lines surrounding the Tokyo fetish porn scene and had sexual encounters with the cursed ghosts of jealous ex- girlfriends, but it was still a serious and heart tugging story of losing your first love. It became one of the darkest things I've ever written as it became a tale about a selfish man refusing to let go, who's unrealistic fantasies of cinematic notions of romance leads him on a violent and self destructive war path that hurts a lot of innocent people and comes with some big consequences. During my series set at the Cannes Film Festival, I wrote about my run ins with a deranged serial killer named Mike Dugal.  Mike was an over the top character, a bad horror film director using a psychotropic mind control drug from Colombia to score film deals and victims. But the series was also an honest and sincere deconstruction of  horror explored the many themes of misogyny inherent with in the genre. My series at the Toronto International Film Festival had corrupt drug dealing cops, bike gang outlaws, and a werewolf. But it was also a tragic tale about the sins of our fathers and the complicated relationships between them and their adult sons. And the less said about the book's conclusion at Fantastic Fest in Austin, the better.  Things get really wild towards the end and I don't want to spoil the surprises. Nearly two 
years since I began all of this, the articles have amassed to a single 380 paged narrative 
with over 60 pages of illustrations. And while there's a wealth of 
information about all of the ins and outs of the film world, the scope 
of the novel is much larger. This isn't just some big inside joke about 
the film world. It has garnered a sizable fan base outside of the usual
 Twitchfilm readership whom have little knowledge or interest in the 
film festival circuit.

WHY DO I NEED YOUR HELP TO FUND THIS? The book is
 mostly finished ,and I initially had two major publishers interested in
 printing it. But as conventional print media crawls closer to its 
grave, they ultimately decided that this was too risky and difficult to 
market to a broader audience. 
 I spent a lot of wasteful time pitching the book to other publishers and there 
always seemed to be some inkling of interest. But I realized that finding 
the right publisher to take this on would be a full time job and could easily 
take a year or two. I already have three other serialized novels 
outlined and ready to be written. I'm proud of Pissing in the Punch Bowl
 but am anxious to move on to the next project. And that’s beauty
 of Indiegogo, I can reach out directly to my fans and potential
 fans like you, my fellow film, comic, and lit nerd 
brethren. Pissing in the Punch Bowl makes fun of everything you hate and
 It makes fun of everything you love.  You’re going to laugh out loud 
when you read it. You’re going to cringe, and you may just blush and 
have to look over your shoulder to check if anyone is watching you. 

WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT THIS INDIEGOGO IF YOU'RE  A FAN AND ALREADY READ THE SERIES ONLINE FOR FREE?Well,
 first off. I never received a single ******* penny for any of it, so 
come on and help a brother out. It’s hard out there for a film writer. Second,
 because you’re a nerd and I understand you because I’m a nerd too. You 
like to own things, you like to collect rare and weird things to put in 
your library to show off. This is going to be a beautiful ultra cool 
looking book and it’s going to look great on your book shelf. And it's going to be signed by yours truly. 
Third, because there’s a lot more story than what you’ve read.
To this day, I still have fans asking me when and if they’ll be able to read the rest of the Yubari series. There’s
 another 70 pages of material, and I think it might be my favorite of 
the whole book. It’s certainly the most personal and possibly the 
darkest.  You’re finally going to get to read that. 

And fourth, my online articles were a mess, they’re full of 
typos, grammatical errors, and strange inconsistencies. I was writing 
these things in line with the film festivals as they took place. That 
means that I was often writing one hundred pages of material in a two 
week time span. It’s impossible to professionally edit and proof that 
much content in that amount of time. It’s all being cleaned up now and 
it’s going to read a lot better. 
And with your help, I can afford to hire a professional editor who’s going to tune this baby up so that it hums like a Hemmy. 
Fifth,
 because you enjoy my writing and art and you want to see more of it. 
The truth about us awful, self centered, narcissistic artists is that we
 crave, nay, need validation. I have tons of new projects in development
 but it's hard to really get the ball rolling on those until I've 
finished this.

And sixth, the rewards are really really sweet. 
You can win original comic page illustrations that were used in the final book.


And for my larger sponsors, there is a wide array of small to large scale original black light paintings. 






And if you dig this artwork, be sure to check out my Etsy
 page, I have a ton of other super cheap artwork circulating out there in the 
internet and there's still time to order a print for Christmas (well, at least until December 21st)!


ADDED HOLIDAY INCENTIVE!


So long as we're 
able to raise at least $10,000 by December 25th, all of my backers up  to that point will receive a special Christmas/New Year's present. I'll be 
illustrating an original piece of pin up erotica just for the holidays.  
So if there's any chance that you have a friend or 
family member who might be a fan of my work and you're donating to my Indiegogo as a gift to them, you'll be getting an email with a high res 
JPEG to print out and frame yourself to let him or her know that they're
 getting the book soon!




WHY IS THIS SO EXPENSIVE AS COMPARED TO OTHER PUBLISHING INDIE-GOGO PROJECTS FROM FIRST TIME WRITERS?


I know that there sure are a lot of other writers on here trying to 
self publish their first novel, and I realize that most of them are only
 asking for $5000 - $10000.
It's kind of scary to be the guy asking for $20,000. But here's the 
thing, self publishing is really expensive. 
I'm still in the process of negotiating with my printer but I expect 
the costs to be anywhere from $6000 - $8000 just for the printing. 
Shipping and handling for 1000 books plus all of the heavier rewards for
 the bigger sponsors will be an additional $5000.
I'll also be hiring a copyright editor and professional graphic 
designer for the layout and plan on painting an additional 6 pages while
 also hiring a professional colorist to rescan and polish up the 
original artwork. All of that should cost an additional $2000 - $3000. 
Add in a small buffer for misc. unexpected expenditures, and the cost
 for printing 1000 books should end up being around $16,000. Then you 
have to figure in the 5% cut that Indiegogo takes and suddenly $20,000 doesn't sound like so much. Actually, it's still on the low end. 
So I really do hope I can even exceed my minimum goal so that I might 
actually make a few dollars for my time and work and the more money that
 I can raise, the better the final product will be. If I can reach 
$30,000, I'll write an additional short story from the perspective of 
one of the novel's most popular characters, Uzi Silverstein. If I can 
reach $40,000, the book will be full of even more outlandish comic book 
artwork. 
If I reach $50,000, I'll make hardcover editions available for any sponsors above $75.
Backers need not worry about meeting my requirements. Hey, that's why
 I'm asking for $20,000 right? Everything has been budgeted with a 
comfortable but reasonable buffer so that no one is left standing with 
their bits dangling in the wind. Also, as already stated, the book is 
finished! It just needs a good cover, a strong page layout, and a little
 spit and polish before it hits the printer. I expect to have all of 
that work finished by the end of March so that the books can be printed in April and mailed out in May and June.   There's always a possibility for 
delay but under no circumstances do I expect that to go beyond the end 
of July.
The only other major hold up would be the legal stuff. I am a first 
time self publisher. I'll be paying a copyright 
attorney to clear everything in the book and to make sure that I won't 
run into any weird future lawsuits when this eventually goes up for sale
 on Amazon and it's impossible to gauge what strange issues could arise.


And with that, I really want to thank you for giving me your time to pitch this crazy project of mine. Hopefully, you're a fan of the work. If not, then maybe you will be. Most importantly, I hope that you can support my first novel and help a struggling/starving artist get his work out there without going any further into debt.

<h3>The Graphic Novel</h3>
<p><strong>THE LAZARUS DEVICE</strong> will be 128 pages of full colour graphic novel - every panel composed of 3D-rendered awesome (like the images on this page).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>In an alternate post-Victorian world on the brink of war, a mysterious woman struggles to break the chains of duty, before they smother her.</i></p>
<p>It's a steampunk adventure that takes place in 1911, in Manchester UK, and is a tale of fantastic science, thrilling action, cynical politics, deep secrets, naive love, nightmarish truth, and terrible betrayal.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590337650/qfgfwirdntjzapzql8gg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Steve Turnbull and I'm a <i>USA Today</i> Bestselling author of over 30 novels in the Science Fiction, Fantasy and Steampunk genres. I've been writing professionally (in different fields including technical magazines and screenwriting) for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>While still writing novels, I recently got interested in 3D rendering using the Daz3D software, and realised I could turn my old web series script <strong>The Lazarus Device</strong> into a graphic novel. The images you see on this page, and the sample page 2 at the bottom, shows what can be achieved.</p>
<p>If you already know my books you can check out the FAQs to find out where this story fits, but if you don't, an important question is whether I'm any good as a writer because you need to know whether what you're going to get is going to be worth reading.</p>
<p>I'm only as good as my reviews, and across all my books I average 4.3 stars out of 5. Here are some sample reviews, all for different books:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""What a book. A pure original plot and unique characters.""</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Great books, but I want more! Thanks for a well thought out world, the books were fast paced without wasted words.""</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""I'm addicted. Steve is officially my favourite author!""</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Seamlessly incorporates history with fiction and fantasy. The only thing I would have liked better is to have the books longer!""</i></p>
<p>All those exclamation marks are genuine, in fact I cut a few out.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590339649/zzoarqzwvrx8dmtjemka.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<hr width=""500""/>
<h3>How long is it going to take?</h3>
<p>The final projected size of the graphic novel is 128 pages, divided into five episodes.</p>
<p>I'm not a full-time writer, and I'll still be producing novels, so I have to be realistic about time scales. This is not going to be a short project and at one page per week minimum, that's over two years of work. It might be quicker since some pages will take less time but let's stick with that estimate.</p>
<p>However, since it is in five episodes, I will release the individual episodes as we go along. As well as having updates and bonus material throughout that time.</p>
<p>There will be times when I do more than a page per week, but I do hope to have the occasional holiday as well.</p>
<p><i>But Steve</i> (you may ask), <i>you've never done a campaign for any of your books before, why are you doing this now?</i></p>

<h3><i>Because I hit a major problem...</i></h3>
<p>The process of rendering 3D images requires a powerful computer but all I have is an old laptop which is great for writing books but can't manage <strong>The Lazarus Device</strong>.</p>
<p>I have tried using online render farms, which can do the job, but I live in an out-of-the-way part of the UK and, to be brutally honest, my Internet connectivity <i>stinks</i>. It's always slow but even worse, it vanishes completely for minutes several times a day.</p>
<p>The amount of data I need to upload to create a scene is typically 7GB. At my internet speed that's about 7 hours uploading, and in that time my Internet will die and I have to start all over again. I honestly tried to make this work. I have spent days (and nights) just trying to upload a single scene.</p>
<p>Occasionally it works, but mostly it doesn't.</p>
<p>I can't rely on it.</p>

<hr width=""500""/>
<h3>So here's the deal...</h3>
<p>I would like you to help me buy a state-of-the-art render machine so that I can make <strong>The Lazarus Device</strong> a reality. And, in return, you get to see it first (plus any extras I might come up with as we go along).</p>
<p> At the very least, a PDF you can print out, or a print copy in soft/hard cover, and even ones signed by me.</p>
<p>The story is fully planned out. The only thing stopping it from progressing is the lack of 3D rendering. If I can't get a machine I can use, it can't happen.</p>

<h3>The Render Machine</h3>

<p>When it comes to using the Daz3D software, or any 3D rendering package, you need to max out on storage and power. Storage because the files tend to be very big, and power to make the rendering happen fast enough. I have to balance those features against overall cost (I could have chosen a machine that's over three times the cost of this one, but it wouldn't be three times faster).</p>
<p><strong>Processor</strong>: <strong>Intel® i9, 10 Core</strong></p>
<p>The number of cores indicates how much work the machine can do simultaneously. This is a beast of a processor and will handle the task well.</p>
<p><strong>Memory (RAM): 32GB</strong></p>
<p>This is the minimum to do what I want sensibly. As a rule the more RAM you have the better.</p>
<p><strong>Storage: 4TB</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned, we need lots of storage because the files can be very big. This is good amount to start with.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590922292/slxedonc3rj8mp5ur2in.jpg"" src="""" style=""float:right;""/>Graphics card: 11GB Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti</strong></p>
<p>This is the most important element because it's the unit that performs the 3D rendering and there are reasons why it needs to be this specific card. The Daz3D software uses ""Iray"" rendering, and that only works on an Nvidia card.</p>
<p>When it's doing the rendering the whole file is loaded onto the card, so the onboard memory needs to be as much as possible. Only the 2080 Ti has 11GB, earlier cards have less and are slower.</p>
<p>So those are the important parts of the package. There are other things like cooling, motherboard and the power supply but I won't list them here.</p>

<p>Originally known as “Goulds”, this comic has been a passion project of mine for well over 3 years. Through that time the format of Analog Farm constantly changed, from originally being a comic, to the pilot of an animated tv show, to back to a comic. But one thing that never changed was making it a story about a boy named Mikey and his journey to develop in a world that no longer cannot.</p>
<p>My name is Bryan Noko, I'm the co creator and writer/designer for Analog Farm. Me along with co creator and art director Kenron Toqueen (Nocta, Tomatita) have spent the last 3 years creating a world inspired by Anime, hip hop, Cuba, and overall development. </p>
<p>This comic takes place in a fictional country known as Goulds, which is heavily inspired by Cuba due to my influence of the culture from growing up in Miami.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we're going with the flexible funding route we would still be able to eventually put out issue two with whatever funds we end up with. However due to the platform fees being higher if we don't reach our goals and having to pay the rest of the funds out of pocket it would take much much longer to distribute the final product. That's why the main risk is time, if we can't reach our first goal we would still aim to tell the best story we can tell with our available resources, but it would just take a lot longer to produce.</p>
<h3><strong>Other ways you can help</strong></h3>
<p>We understand not everyone can donate, so don't worry if you can't pledge this year. We're still very grateful for all the support you've all given us these past three years. Even sharing this campaign to your friends and family would be just as good as a donation. thank you so much for the support and remember to break through your shells.</p>
</div></div>","Originally known as “Goulds”, this comic has been a passion project of mine for well over 3 years. Through that time the format of Analog Farm constantly changed, from originally being a comic, to the pilot of an animated tv show, to back to a comic. But one thing that never changed was making it a story about a boy named Mikey and his journey to develop in a world that no longer cannot.
My name is Bryan Noko, I'm the co creator and writer/designer for Analog Farm. Me along with co creator and art director Kenron Toqueen (Nocta, Tomatita) have spent the last 3 years creating a world inspired by Anime, hip hop, Cuba, and overall development. 
This comic takes place in a fictional country known as Goulds, which is heavily inspired by Cuba due to my influence of the culture from growing up in Miami.

 
The comic is centered around the theme of development and focuses on a young anime protagonist known as Mikey Manzueta

His main goal is to develop into something more, and while his peer and mentor Gori (a young shaman plant enthusiast) 

 
suspects he's talking about developing his body, he really means he wants to develop into something more original.

Please contribute to the Douglas of all Douglases by giving him the stupidest, but possibly greatest, tattoo of all time. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This tattoo will honor the longstanding legacy of Doug Funnie and his achievements in life, Doug would be 33 years old today. RIP Doug Funnie.</p>

<p>Your money will always only be used if Douglas actually gets the tattoo. Making this risk free and completely worth your time.</p></span></span></span></span></div>","Are you ready for some Doug on Doug action?
