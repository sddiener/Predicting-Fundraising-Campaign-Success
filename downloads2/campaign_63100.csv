<p>Imagine having to say goodbye to your unborn child, planning the birth knowing there was no chance of survival, no parent can.  It's deeply saddening to know that some parents must face such an unimaginable inevitability.  This is the story of heroic little Theodore and his Mommies Amanda Leliever and Jacqueline Peters of Orangeville, Ontario.  Please take a moment to read their journey, and perhaps show some support to two young parents who desperately need it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Tuesday October 30, 2012 Amanda and Jacquie went in for their 20 week ultrasound when they noticed some abnormalities in the baby.  After some more detailed testing was done it was determined that the baby had Trisomy 13<span>. <span>also called Patau syndrome, it is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body.</span>  What Amanda and Jacquie were told was that Theodore's<span> head is very long, there is no pronounced face, possibly a major cleft in the mouth because they cannot decipher lips or nose. There are eye sockets but no eyes, there may only be one if anything at all. Most of the brian is missing, the main component to breathe is not there, only a brain stem. There is a heart beating nice and strong but missing some valves. And the kidneys are not functioning. There are supposed to be 2 arteries and 1 vein in the umbilical cord but there is only 1 artery, the only oxygen getting to the baby is through Amanda.  </span><span>There is no way her body would carry the baby full term, it would spontaneously miscarry at any time and when the baby is born, it will die as soon at the cord is cut. There will be no chance at life so on November 8 the doctors will induce labour, they expect he may take one or two breaths before passing away peacefully.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Upon hearing the news of their baby's condition Amanda and Jacquie bravely wrote a letter to their friends and family informing them of their ordeal, I've copied it below for everyone to read.  Everything I've written here thus far comes directly from this letter.  Their courage in the face of such a tragedy is inspiring, to write such words of positivity and gratitude through such pain is a testament to their character.  <span>Heroic little Theodore is lucky to have two such amazing parents who love him unconditionally and will cherish every moment they've had together and every moment still to come.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are no words of comfort to offer these brave parents, but maybe as a group we can come together at their time of need and offer our support.  We can't ease their emotional and physical burden, but maybe we can help financially.  Whether it be the cost of a memorial for Theodore, or to ease the pressure of financial obligations while they grieve, or perhaps they may need to get away after saying goodbye.  Please join me in contributing anything you can, even if it's only a few dollars, and if you can't afford to contribute it's ok.  Maybe you can help spread the word and make some noise for Heroic little Theodore,</span></span></p>

The ultrasound tech was absolutely amazing and we commend her. She excused herself and went to talk to the radiologist. They were both back a few minutes later. The radiologist, another amazing person, explained to us that the baby's head was not the right shape, the face didn't look proper and there was something wrong with the heart.</span><br/><span>He left and we cried. The tech then asked if we wanted to see what the radiologist meant and of course we wanted to see. It was very obvious of the problem.</span><br/><span>They called our OBGYN right away who was busy at the time so said to go home and he would call as soon as he could.</span><br/><span>The OB called back a little while later saying he hadn't got the report from radiology yet but he was given a verbal report and said he was sending that report down to Mount Sinai as soon as he received it which he did.</span><br/><span>We got a phone call from Mount Sinai wednesday morning at 11am and we were told to come for an appointment at 1pm to the special pregnancy unit so we said yes and left right away.</span><br/><span>At that appointment we went in to see a doctor who brought us into a room, asked a bunch of questions and then we started the detailed ultrasound.</span><br/><span>We were told by the previous report that they think the abnormality is chromosomal and is called Trisomy 13 or Patau Syndrome.

<p>The TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation) electrically stimulates your nerves to temporarily relieve your
pain. TENS-type devices require electrodes to be attached to your skin to
generate electrical stimulation, which might cause inconvenience and discomfort.
They also involve the additional high cost of above 25 US$ per month to
exchange the electrodes.</p>
<p>PEM Wave™CARE is the most convenient device. It does
not require strong electrical stimulation, uncomfortable belts or bands,

<p>Note that there are no side effects and it is safe for everyone, no matter the age.</p>
<p>To date PEMF Therapy has proven safe. However there is concern today regarding exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) causing health problems. It seems the cumulative exposure to EMF day in and day out is of the greatest concern from all manner of electrical devices in our lives as many of these devices emit high frequencies in the kilohertz, megahertz and gigahertz range.</p>
<p>It is therefore a matter of distinguishing good EMF from bad EMF. Science teaches us that all energy is electromagnetic in nature hence it is impossible to escape EMF altogether because our own bodies radiate EMF as does all of nature.</p>
<p>PEM Wave™Care uses pulses of low frequency electro-magnetic energy for short durations. Research has shown this is not detrimental to the body but quite the opposite, increasing oxygenation to the cells, improving blood circulation and lymph flow, aiding detoxification and enhancing cell metabolism, energy production and integrity.</p>

<p>PEM Wave™ recharges the whole body. A deficiency of electromagnetism in the body is like running out of air. PEM Wave™ creates electro-magnetic fields matching those produced by the earth and our bodies. PEM Wave™ is a simple, fast, and effective way to improve the healing potential of each and every cell in the body!</p>
<p>PEM Wave™ re-energizes damaged cells by inducing electrical changes within the cell that restore it to it’s normal healthy state. Because of this, cellular metabolism is boosted, blood cells are regenerated, circulation is improved and oxygen carrying capacity is increased. Ultimately, the immune system becomes healthier, the nervous system relaxes, bones and joints become stronger and vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and colon are able to rid themselves of impurities thus detoxifying the body. PEM Wave™ can reduce pain and improve the quality of your life by allowing your body to function as it was designed to do.</p>

<h4>Wellness &amp; Healthcare Aspects</h4>
<div>
<p>Poor blood circulation leads to insufficient nutrition supply, which results in decreased skin regeneration and makes your body easily damaged by external stimuli. Also, oxygen deficiency, due to poor blood circulation, makes your skin dry and rough, promoting skin aging, reducing elasticity, and increasing wrinkles. It also causes insomnia or male sexual dysfunction.</p>

<p></p>
<h4>Medical Aspects</h4>
<div>
<p>Many diseases are related to blood circulation.</p>
<p>Most patients suffering from chronic diseases have blood circulation problems . In particular, celebrant infarction, cardiac infarction, hypertension, artery hardening, and nephritis are caused by blood circulation disorders.</p>
<p>If we observe the blood of a cancer patient, the red blood cells are tangled to clog the capillary vessels, which cause oxygen deficiency and cause cancer. There is no cancer in a heart, because it always circulates blood. Therefore, you can prevent various diseases, including cancer, by improving blood circulation.</p>

<p>We categorized the body’s skin, blood vessel, muscle, tendon, ligament, nerves, joints, and bone marrow into 8 three-dimensional energetic layers. Among these, except for the skin and the bone marrow, 6 energetic layers could be cured by finding the distorted natural frequency and treating it, reverting it to its natural state. </p>
<p>We applied the PEMF treatment technology and meridian system to the various energetic layers in order to settle and rearrange the distorted balance in the body.</p>

<p>Every single cell, tissue, and organ system within the human body has a certain natural frequency, helping to regulate important functions and keep us healthy. The human body vibrating within its natural frequency range is considered in a state of health. </p>
<p>When the natural frequencies of the body are disturbed by internal or external causes, they become distorted and lowered, leading to symptoms and eventually disease in the body.</p>
<p>We have developed a new treatment method that corrects the imbalance of biomedical energy due to distorted natural frequency. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Through this treatment, the natural frequency can be restored and at the same time, diseases can be cured and prevented. </span></p>

<p>When a cell, such as a red blood cell, is damaged, it loses the ideal charge. This causes red cells to stick together and stack like coins, making circulation slow. When PEM Wave™ passes through the red cell, the membrane becomes properly charged, allowing the red cell to keep separate from other red cells, thereby improving circulation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458639784/ijfp447a71uwj1kpxtin.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>In addition, PEM Wave™ increases various chemicals in the blood vessel walls that cause the blood vessels to dilate, improving the amount of blood flowing through the vessels and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458639913/hmqaznsimia1tk0bfbsk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>

<p>Soft tissue are made up of billions of cells each of which is surrounded by a semi-permeable membrane. Through this membrane pass certain types of ions known as ‘cations’, which flow into the cells, and ‘anions’, which flow out. The flow of ions would produce a miniscule but virtually undetectable magnetic field. If the cell is damaged, then the flow of ions may be reduced and hence the cell either is reduced in its function, or dies. Without ions, a cell cannot live. </p>
<p>When PEM Wave™ is applied over a damaged area, it penetrates into the tissues and has the effect of inducing movement of ions, back into alignment. The result is that the ions once again return to their correct position within the cell. The cell regains its natural healthy balance, and any damage is repaired.</p>

for 60 years, and our method is a more advanced version of the existing PEMF
treatment.</p>
<p>With over 4 years of medical inspection of the treatment
effects of our device, we have finally acquired the best results. There are
already various devices in the market, using the PEMF method to relieve pain,
inflammation, sports injuries, insomnia, urinary incontinence, and menstrual
pain, and the U.S. FDA has approved their medicinal effects.</p>
<p>Using our innovative wearable technology, we will provide a
highly effective treatment, while minimizing the size of the conventional PEMF
treatment device.</p>

< Pem Wave™CARE - Direction of use >








Our goal is to produce a wearable device that anyone can readily use anywhere, without a burden of expense. Our highly professional team devoted 7 years of investigation and its best efforts to produce a healthcare device that effectively treats severe pain and infections. The result was PEM Wave™CARE, a wearable device proven to provide relief of chronic pain and improve blood circulation.
We hope to share and further develop our advanced device with you.






The World's Smallest Medical Device


We have invented the smallest wearable medical device that is easy to use, so patients can cure themselves at any time. This device is amazingly small and slim - it is only 36mm wide, 7.8mm thick.  










PEM Wave™ comprises 6 different products. The PEM Wave™CARE for chronic pain, PEM Wave™CURE for the treatment of chronic disease, PEM Wave™WELL for woman, PEM Wave™RIPE for student,  PEM Wave™BACK for senior, and PEM Wave™ABLE for man.
In this Indiegogo campaign, we are leading a campaign for PEM Wave™CARE. 






PEM
Wave™CARE is the world's only wearable medical device that provides relief of
chronic pain and improves blood circulation. PEM Wave™CARE is a 100% drug free new therapy technology proven to relieve pain.
























A Scientific Breakthrough For Tangible Results In Promoting Wellness.
This device emits lower intensity magnetic field frequency that asymmetrically oscillates giving a significant treatment within 30 cm of distance from your body.



Supported Therapy Modes
Featuring 9 different modes for relieving pain and inflammation, muscle damage and improving overall wellness, this revolutionary device can provide highly effective medical treatment and timely prevention against various diseases.



















Clinically
Proven of PEMF Therapy










PEM Wave™CARE is the world's safest medical device of getting
exempted from the US FDA certification (FDA class I, 510K) that has an
excellent treatment effect with the use of PEMF principle.
We will give you 100% of money back within 90
days of purchase if your pain persists after treating yourself for one
full session (10 weeks) of the ‘PEM Wave™CARE Recovery Program'.
The effective treatment rate of the PEMF-based PEM Wave™CARE is around 80~90%,
so your chronic pain might not be perfectly improved, but you should expect an
improvement nonetheless.
It is strongly anticipated that you would experience not only
the effect of pain relief, but also various positive changes in your body,
including the improvement of blood circulation among other benefits. We also
expect that additional improvement or treatment of other diseases may also
happen. If you find yourself having these great benefits, we suggest you to
continually use PEM Wave™CARE with the purpose of wellness, instead of just
pain relieving.
If you are not satisfied with your wellness improvement, please
make a PayPal account first, and send your PayPal account information to support@nautilus-lab.com for
a full refund.








PEM Wave™CARE vs other Portable PEMF Therapy


Many inconveniences accompany using the PEMF medical devices, generally used in medical clinics. You have to visit the hospital to receive the treatment, and the highly intensive PEMF is not suitable for chronic treatment, due to its potential hazardous effects on human bodies.
Our innovative wearable technology made it possible to wear a device, instead of the conventional portable PEMF medical devices. It is the world's safest medical device with its ultra-low intensity magnetic field.









PEM Wave™CARE vs other Wearable Therapy


There are several types of wearable pain relieving medical devices in the market. However, they are too large in size and complex in structure, so users often feel uncomfortable wearing them. Also, they are relatively expensive.
PEM Wave™CARE, the world's smallest wearable device, can be simply attached to your clothes or skin to provide treatment effects.









PEM Wave™CARE vs TENS


The TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation) electrically stimulates your nerves to temporarily relieve your
pain. TENS-type devices require electrodes to be attached to your skin to
generate electrical stimulation, which might cause inconvenience and discomfort.
They also involve the additional high cost of above 25 US$ per month to
exchange the electrodes.
PEM Wave™CARE is the most convenient device. It does
not require strong electrical stimulation, uncomfortable belts or bands,
additional expenses to exchange electrodes, or difficult settings, typically
involved in TENS devices.












Provides treatment and healthcare at the same time.  







This device includes healthcare capabilities
that not only soothe your pain, but also improve blood circulation and
immunity.
Many diseases are related to blood circulation.
Natural improvement of blood circulation brings additional wellness effects,
including prevention of chronic pain, deep sleep, skin care, anti-aging,
enhanced sexual function, and weight loss.
This device is essential not only for the
health care of pain patients, but also for family members.





This is an innovative treatment method.






We established a new theory in the medical aspect that human bodies comprise three-dimensional energetic layers, and we developed the new treatment method, grounded on such theory.
This treatment method adjusts the
distorted natural frequencies of each of the six energetic layers of blood,
muscles, tendons, ligaments, nerves, and joints. The adjusted natural
frequencies brings back your health and provides the treatment and prevention
effects against diseases to help keep you healthy.





The device itself provides Bluetooth. 


PEM Wave™CARE contains Bluetooth. Patients can operate the device through Bluetooth and smartphone app to manage their most effective, personalized treatment method throughout the day. 
In addition, this smartphone app sends all treatment relevant information to the server. The data collected in the server is analyzed and used as big data that is applied for all patients. 





It is the world’s safest treatment.







Note that there are no side effects and it is safe for everyone, no matter the age.
To date PEMF Therapy has proven safe. However there is concern today regarding exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) causing health problems. It seems the cumulative exposure to EMF day in and day out is of the greatest concern from all manner of electrical devices in our lives as many of these devices emit high frequencies in the kilohertz, megahertz and gigahertz range.
It is therefore a matter of distinguishing good EMF from bad EMF. Science teaches us that all energy is electromagnetic in nature hence it is impossible to escape EMF altogether because our own bodies radiate EMF as does all of nature.
PEM Wave™Care uses pulses of low frequency electro-magnetic energy for short durations. Research has shown this is not detrimental to the body but quite the opposite, increasing oxygenation to the cells, improving blood circulation and lymph flow, aiding detoxification and enhancing cell metabolism, energy production and integrity.




You can also operate your device through Bluetooth and our smartphone App for personalized treatment 24/7; anywhere, anytime.





Smartphone App.

The process in the treatment and information, regarding your results, is sent to your smartphone through Bluetooth once the application is activated. 




After opening the smartphone application, chronic pain or other diseases and the prescribed usage time can be selected on the main screen. When the treatment button is pressed, treatment is performed throughout a designated time. 



The treatment records of PEM Wave™CARE are sent to your smartphone in real time. The application saves the treatment records, frequency, and time, and sends it to the data server online, where it analyzes treatment patterns. These patterns keep you informed of your treatment patterns.
You can record the results of the treatment from PEM Wave™CARE on this application. We will continually update and manage the application using the big data from numerous users of this device to provide you with the best treatment method, expected time, and expected results. 








PEM Wave™ recharges the whole body. A deficiency of electromagnetism in the body is like running out of air. PEM Wave™ creates electro-magnetic fields matching those produced by the earth and our bodies. PEM Wave™ is a simple, fast, and effective way to improve the healing potential of each and every cell in the body!
PEM Wave™ re-energizes damaged cells by inducing electrical changes within the cell that restore it to it’s normal healthy state. Because of this, cellular metabolism is boosted, blood cells are regenerated, circulation is improved and oxygen carrying capacity is increased. Ultimately, the immune system becomes healthier, the nervous system relaxes, bones and joints become stronger and vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and colon are able to rid themselves of impurities thus detoxifying the body. PEM Wave™ can reduce pain and improve the quality of your life by allowing your body to function as it was designed to do.














































We started the development of this medical device from prototyping in 2013 through the Alpha Stages and have finalized the final Betas of wearable types in fall 2015. 
We have completed the development process. The production and registration  of FDA will be done for sales in the US markets. 

























Wellness & Healthcare Aspects

Poor blood circulation leads to insufficient nutrition supply, which results in decreased skin regeneration and makes your body easily damaged by external stimuli. Also, oxygen deficiency, due to poor blood circulation, makes your skin dry and rough, promoting skin aging, reducing elasticity, and increasing wrinkles. It also causes insomnia or male sexual dysfunction.


Medical Aspects

Many diseases are related to blood circulation.
Most patients suffering from chronic diseases have blood circulation problems . In particular, celebrant infarction, cardiac infarction, hypertension, artery hardening, and nephritis are caused by blood circulation disorders.
If we observe the blood of a cancer patient, the red blood cells are tangled to clog the capillary vessels, which cause oxygen deficiency and cause cancer. There is no cancer in a heart, because it always circulates blood. Therefore, you can prevent various diseases, including cancer, by improving blood circulation.












Nautilus Lab. has been independent
from its mother company, since 2014, in order to produce an
innovative wearable medical device. We are a start-up company, led by
Korean-American Eunice. 
This company is a subsidiary company
of TouchnFun Interactive (HK) Ltd., which was established in Hong Kong, in
2003. Currently, the company is based in Korea with a US Riverside office. 


In 2015, we passed the local government evaluation in Korea. We are now based in ‘Wonju Medical device Complex Center’ where government officials specialized in the area of medicine are supporting us. 
We have finished the development of our innovative wearable medical device with the hi-tech testing materials and researchers supported by the government. 
After successfully finishing this campaign, we plan to start the production of PEM Wave™ through GMP for FDA registration in our own factory situated in ‘Wonju Medical device Complex Center’. 















Pulsed Energetic Multi-Layer System





We categorized the body’s skin, blood vessel, muscle, tendon, ligament, nerves, joints, and bone marrow into 8 three-dimensional energetic layers. Among these, except for the skin and the bone marrow, 6 energetic layers could be cured by finding the distorted natural frequency and treating it, reverting it to its natural state. 
We applied the PEMF treatment technology and meridian system to the various energetic layers in order to settle and rearrange the distorted balance in the body.

SYNTONIZATION

Every single cell, tissue, and organ system within the human body has a certain natural frequency, helping to regulate important functions and keep us healthy. The human body vibrating within its natural frequency range is considered in a state of health. 
When the natural frequencies of the body are disturbed by internal or external causes, they become distorted and lowered, leading to symptoms and eventually disease in the body.
We have developed a new treatment method that corrects the imbalance of biomedical energy due to distorted natural frequency. Through this treatment, the natural frequency can be restored and at the same time, diseases can be cured and prevented. 




When a cell, such as a red blood cell, is damaged, it loses the ideal charge. This causes red cells to stick together and stack like coins, making circulation slow. When PEM Wave™ passes through the red cell, the membrane becomes properly charged, allowing the red cell to keep separate from other red cells, thereby improving circulation. 

In addition, PEM Wave™ increases various chemicals in the blood vessel walls that cause the blood vessels to dilate, improving the amount of blood flowing through the vessels and therefore increasing the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues.




Soft tissue are made up of billions of cells each of which is surrounded by a semi-permeable membrane. Through this membrane pass certain types of ions known as ‘cations’, which flow into the cells, and ‘anions’, which flow out. The flow of ions would produce a miniscule but virtually undetectable magnetic field. If the cell is damaged, then the flow of ions may be reduced and hence the cell either is reduced in its function, or dies. Without ions, a cell cannot live. 
When PEM Wave™ is applied over a damaged area, it penetrates into the tissues and has the effect of inducing movement of ions, back into alignment. The result is that the ions once again return to their correct position within the cell. The cell regains its natural healthy balance, and any damage is repaired.





PEMF [Pulsed Electro-Magnetic Field Therapy] therapy is already registered by the FDA to promote the healing of bone fractures and is in the process of being approved for many other uses, from migraines to depression, to sports injuries.
We are planning the process for the PEM Wave™CARE to register as a Medical device in US. The PEM Wave™CARE along with other medical devices that have applied PEMF technology is FDA class I, 510 (K) exempt safe and is a medical device that is proven to be effective. Thus, there will be no risks in selling this device after FDA registration.






We have invested an enormous amount of time and effort for
this project, and finally after seven years, it is completed for production. We
are so thankful for your participation and support. We provide an easy and safe
way to treat disease in the patients, suffering pain and health issues, with
little economic pressure.
You need not worry about the production process nor the
quality of our products. We will guarantee the best quality. We are cooperating
with medical experts in our factory within the Wonju Medical Device Center, an
advanced medical device facility operated by the local government of Korea.
Also, you need not worry about the remedial effects. The
PEMF treatment method has been used in medical clinics in the U.S. and Europe
for 60 years, and our method is a more advanced version of the existing PEMF
treatment.
With over 4 years of medical inspection of the treatment
effects of our device, we have finally acquired the best results. There are
already various devices in the market, using the PEMF method to relieve pain,
inflammation, sports injuries, insomnia, urinary incontinence, and menstrual
pain, and the U.S. FDA has approved their medicinal effects.
Using our innovative wearable technology, we will provide a
highly effective treatment, while minimizing the size of the conventional PEMF
treatment device.













We have completed the development of PEM Wave™CURE, which can cure 8 types of chronic diseases. We will reveal the PEM Wave™CURE after successfully ending this campaign. Since this medical device requires FDA class I or II clearance, it will take a long time to get it in the market. Thus, we desperately need your help. 
If you sign the preclinical research project for the PEM Wave™CURE at the next Indiegogo campaign, we will send you samples for preclinical research within 30 days. Your participation in the preclinical research data will dramatically decrease the time required for FDA clearance of PEM Wave™CURE. 
We hope for a new medical world, where people can save money on medical clinic fees and cure their chronic diseases themselves. PEM Wave™CURE has 8 illness treatment modes that are set for service. The participant can choose the treatment, according to personal needs and test it out himself.

You Can Now Help Us Make A Difference.

We sincerely hope many people will live happier lives without pain from diseases and spend time and effort developing the PEM Wave™. 
Our first goal is to get funding through this campaign to collect money for production. However, more importantly, we hope to share this new wearable medical device with more people and develop it together. 


With your financial support, we will be able to:
- The costs regarding molding, GMP screening, and FDA registration for the manufacturing of the product.
- Align with medical researchers worldwide 
- Build a community for patients



We look forward to establishing
a new wellness lifestyle with your investment. Such a lifestyle will help the
patients readily treat their pains and diseases without any burdens.
We understand that it is very difficult to break the
frame of the existing medical treatment method. However, your participation in
this project will give you the chance to break from these inconvenient norms. 
We have long been making our
best efforts to complete this project. We sincerely hope that this innovative
device will be released into the world through your active support and
participation.The costs

Others are too overwhelmed by the vast array of offerings, all promising different results, to create a routine at all.</p><p>Our mission is to change this.</p><p>How? We make it simple.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Our Ethos</strong></p><p>Hommage is about <strong>routine</strong>.</p><p>With 3 simple products we provide bespoke routines, tailored to your skin type, which we encourage you to adopt as rituals. Just 5 minutes in the morning and 5 at night for genuinely visible results. In addition to this, our premium skincare and grooming products encourage men to take a few moments out of their stressful lives to <strong>LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES</strong>! </p><p>Hommage is striving to remove the guess-work by providing the information needed in a simple digital format. We don't push consumers to buy our products, we educate them to make the right choices whilst offering our combination of premium quality with effortless adoption.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why Should You Care?</strong></p><p>Well, despite the fact that the skin is the largest organ in your body, what lengths do you go to in order to build routine in the gym, at work or on your personal goals? I know many guys who spend thousands of pounds on gym membership a year and are relentless in their routine to build the body they desire, or spend hundreds (if not thousands!) on good quality suits, shirts and shoes to look after their appearance. But when it comes to skincare? £5 creams and lotions that do very little for your skin health other than loading it with surfactants and clogging pores. Why people? WHY?</p><p>I often get asked how I got into the industry, particularly given my more financially-focused background. To put it simply, I was one of those people. I never looked after my skin, I was overworked and constantly stressed, suffering from chronic Acne and, as a result, lack of confidence. I believed all the gender-based stigmas I know now to be truly dated - primarily that indulging in proper skincare was outside the realms of what was stereotypically “masculine”. None of my male friends (or so I thought) were doing it. I washed my face with soap and water convinced I was stripping it of all the 'bad' oils and pollution (the more the better).</p><p>How wrong I was. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Discovered...</strong></p><p>When we started on this journey, I was astonished at some of the feedback we were getting. When asking questions like ""<i>what made you choose your specific brands/products? "", </i>I received<i> </i>many quotes like ""always used it"", ""they marketed their product well"", ""it was just what I found off the shelf"" - the list goes on...</p><p>What came out was fascinating and still drives me to this day. We have been gifted the ability to change the lives of other men like me for the better through a 'look good, feel good' principle, helping hundreds of men to take care of themselves through a small commitment to skin health during that 5 minutes of calm twice a day - cleansing and moisturising their skin.</p><p>The good news is that more men than ever are investing in their appearance (mostly privately), particularly when it comes to preserving youthful skin, and this is growing significantly year on year.</p><p>The fact is that skincare, like personal hygiene, is genderless.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Our Challenge</strong></p><p>Despite the positive traction in the industry, the key problem remains a lack of personalised education. Whether that means what products to buy or what the benefits are of a more 'preventative' instead of 'reactive' approach (one of the most important topics we tell all of our customers).</p><p> </p><p><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></p><p>Your investment in this instance will help us to expand and supercharge the Hommage mission, creating digital content that ‘normalises’ male skincare rituals, while expanding both our range, with new and innovative products, and our reach, allowing more customers to try and test our products.</p><p>Your reward for this...? The first step to exploring and restoring your own (or a loved one's) skin health through one essential routine. </p><p>We developed these products for you, and the fact that a vast number of our customers switch to our optional subscription service is evidence, in itself, that they work. But we need your help to do more to make significant traction in the movement towards a better wellness routine for men. </p><p> </p><p><strong>“Become a Tastemaker”</strong></p><p>For those with an appetite for the very best Hommage has to offer, we have created The Ultimate Monaco Kit and introduced our new ‘Taste-Maker’ Programme. </p><p>By opting for this kit, you are automatically invited to join and become instrumental in ensuring we continue to deliver the very best. </p><p>We test and tweak our products relentlessly before making them available to the public. And who better to preview them than you? The very people whose desires we aim to fulfil. </p><p>So, on top of receiving this specifically designed collection (which is not available as a package outside of Indiegogo) at a substantial discount, we would love to invite you to be part of the team, ensuring our quality meets your discerning standards.</p><p>Before any new product becomes available to the public, we will send you samples so that, should you choose, you can offer valued feedback, and we will listen.  </p><p>There is <strong>no obligation</strong> to do so but, at Hommage, we firmly believe that the people who are most invested in our success should have the opportunity to help shape our future.</p><p>We look forward to welcoming you on board.</p><p> </p><p>                        ________________________________________________________________</p><p> </p><p>Even if this particular project isn't for you, we would really appreciate your support in other ways by either donating to the cause or directing those who would benefit from our mission towards this campaign. </p><p>Every little helps!</p><p>All the best, </p><p>Jonathan White - CEO Hommage </p><p> </p><h3><strong>Customer Testimonials</strong></h3><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589297401/hedhn184ehsfoy0mhf6x.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589297044/afrsx9catwttmtfi2s36.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Here is a snapshot of some of our <strong>verified </strong>customer testimonials.

</h3><p>3 essential steps, 1 powerful routine. All it takes is consistency and dedication to the cause.</p><p><u>Step 1: Cleanse</u></p><p>Apply lukewarm water to the face to prime the skin and act as a lather. Using 2 pumps and your fingers, massage gently onto the face and neck covering all areas where oil and dirt can build up (including behind the ears).  Massage in a circular motion at least 5 times in each area (depending on the build-up of oil this can be more). Wash thoroughly with lukewarm water to clear the skin. Pat gently with a clean dry towel.</p><p><i>Tip - Imagine your face is covered in mud and you had to wash it off.

Others are too overwhelmed by the vast array of offerings, all promising different results, to create a routine at all.Our mission is to change this.How? We make it simple. Our EthosHommage is about routine.With 3 simple products we provide bespoke routines, tailored to your skin type, which we encourage you to adopt as rituals. Just 5 minutes in the morning and 5 at night for genuinely visible results. In addition to this, our premium skincare and grooming products encourage men to take a few moments out of their stressful lives to LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES! Hommage is striving to remove the guess-work by providing the information needed in a simple digital format. We don't push consumers to buy our products, we educate them to make the right choices whilst offering our combination of premium quality with effortless adoption. Why Should You Care?Well, despite the fact that the skin is the largest organ in your body, what lengths do you go to in order to build routine in the gym, at work or on your personal goals? I know many guys who spend thousands of pounds on gym membership a year and are relentless in their routine to build the body they desire, or spend hundreds (if not thousands!) on good quality suits, shirts and shoes to look after their appearance. But when it comes to skincare? £5 creams and lotions that do very little for your skin health other than loading it with surfactants and clogging pores. Why people? WHY?I often get asked how I got into the industry, particularly given my more financially-focused background. To put it simply, I was one of those people. I never looked after my skin, I was overworked and constantly stressed, suffering from chronic Acne and, as a result, lack of confidence. I believed all the gender-based stigmas I know now to be truly dated - primarily that indulging in proper skincare was outside the realms of what was stereotypically “masculine”. None of my male friends (or so I thought) were doing it. I washed my face with soap and water convinced I was stripping it of all the 'bad' oils and pollution (the more the better).How wrong I was.  What We Discovered...When we started on this journey, I was astonished at some of the feedback we were getting. When asking questions like ""what made you choose your specific brands/products? "", I received many quotes like ""always used it"", ""they marketed their product well"", ""it was just what I found off the shelf"" - the list goes on...What came out was fascinating and still drives me to this day. We have been gifted the ability to change the lives of other men like me for the better through a 'look good, feel good' principle, helping hundreds of men to take care of themselves through a small commitment to skin health during that 5 minutes of calm twice a day - cleansing and moisturising their skin.The good news is that more men than ever are investing in their appearance (mostly privately), particularly when it comes to preserving youthful skin, and this is growing significantly year on year.The fact is that skincare, like personal hygiene, is genderless. Our ChallengeDespite the positive traction in the industry, the key problem remains a lack of personalised education. Whether that means what products to buy or what the benefits are of a more 'preventative' instead of 'reactive' approach (one of the most important topics we tell all of our customers). How Can You Help?Your investment in this instance will help us to expand and supercharge the Hommage mission, creating digital content that ‘normalises’ male skincare rituals, while expanding both our range, with new and innovative products, and our reach, allowing more customers to try and test our products.Your reward for this...? The first step to exploring and restoring your own (or a loved one's) skin health through one essential routine. We developed these products for you, and the fact that a vast number of our customers switch to our optional subscription service is evidence, in itself, that they work. But we need your help to do more to make significant traction in the movement towards a better wellness routine for men.  “Become a Tastemaker”For those with an appetite for the very best Hommage has to offer, we have created The Ultimate Monaco Kit and introduced our new ‘Taste-Maker’ Programme. By opting for this kit, you are automatically invited to join and become instrumental in ensuring we continue to deliver the very best. We test and tweak our products relentlessly before making them available to the public. And who better to preview them than you? The very people whose desires we aim to fulfil. So, on top of receiving this specifically designed collection (which is not available as a package outside of Indiegogo) at a substantial discount, we would love to invite you to be part of the team, ensuring our quality meets your discerning standards.Before any new product becomes available to the public, we will send you samples so that, should you choose, you can offer valued feedback, and we will listen.  There is no obligation to do so but, at Hommage, we firmly believe that the people who are most invested in our success should have the opportunity to help shape our future.We look forward to welcoming you on board.                         ________________________________________________________________ Even if this particular project isn't for you, we would really appreciate your support in other ways by either donating to the cause or directing those who would benefit from our mission towards this campaign. Every little helps!All the best, Jonathan White - CEO Hommage  Customer Testimonials Here is a snapshot of some of our verified customer testimonials. For more please feel free to visit our website. “Great quality skincare products for men, perfect for my dry skin, no skin irritation now.” - Simoash A. using Skincare Sample Pack“This is a very good quality product and would definitely buy again.” - Gary R. using Shave Cream: Perform""I've used a number of different brands over the years and I can honestly say this is the best one. It has made a noticeable difference since I've started using it."" - Jon C. using Eye Serum: Awaken.""The best kit there is, I have tried several other brands of cleansers and moisturizers and I have found this to be top notch! The kit makes it very simple to follow a facial hygiene program.""- Josh N. using Face Care Subscription Plan""I have used this product for 3 years, after shaving in the mornings and before bed at night. It smells amazing and leaves my skin soft and doesn't get oily."" - Viv W. using Face Moisturizer: Fortify""I was impressed both, the Short time of delivery and meanwhile the good-looking and nice wrapping of the products. The quality of the products is, of course, outstanding, meaning I was and continue to be a loyal and completely satisfied user of HOMAGE. Many thanks! Hb"" - Branda H. using Skincare Gift Set""The Face Cleanser ""Core Cleanser"" is phenomenal!! It is light and refreshing and has their signature ""Monaco"" scent. This product is a great product in a line of great products!!!! This face cleanser is gentle but cleans extremely well and smells great!! What more can a guy want!!""  - James Q. using Face Cleanser: Purify""Of all the face cleansers I’ve ever used this is the cleanest and lightest feeling. It doesn’t feel like anything is left over it does a good job of clearing your face. I have way less blemishes as well."" - T.J.B using Face Cleanser: Purify""I received the Hommage products through an on line men's box subscription service. Eye serum, facial cleaner and the face moisturizer. All three were outstanding, quality products. I use the cleaner and moisturizer daily. The moisturizer was the smaller 28ml size that just won't empty after what has to be at least a couple months of daily use already. That said, it is due to be used up soon (I think??) so I proactively ordered this 120ml size which for the price point is awesome (getting what will be more than three smaller bottles for the better, discounted price overall). I'm glad I was presented with this introduction to Hommage and expect to be a long-time customer! Tell your friends!"" - Joe using Face Moisturiser: Fortify, Face Cleanser: Purify and Eye Serum: Awaken""Great Product, I keep on reordering it!"" - Louis S. using Gentle Face Cleanser: Balance""This is the best I have ever used"" - George S using Face Moisturizer: Fortify The Essential Routine
 
3 essential steps, 1 powerful routine. All it takes is consistency and dedication to the cause.Step 1: CleanseApply lukewarm water to the face to prime the skin and act as a lather. Using 2 pumps and your fingers, massage gently onto the face and neck covering all areas where oil and dirt can build up (including behind the ears).  Massage in a circular motion at least 5 times in each area (depending on the build-up of oil this can be more). Wash thoroughly with lukewarm water to clear the skin. Pat gently with a clean dry towel.Tip - Imagine your face is covered in mud and you had to wash it off. Dirt and pollution may not be visible but it's there! Step 2: FortifyApply 2 pumps (more in harsher weather conditions or if you suffer from dry skin) to your fingers and massage gently to the face and neck making sure to distribute to all exposed areas (avoiding under eyes).Tip - This moisturiser is designed to lock in moisture and protect your skin from the elements so make sure you especially protect the vulnerable areas.Step 3: AwakenApply 1-2 pumps to your finger and gently dab onto the skin under each eye.

Yes, it’s also important to choose a right slab of meat, to process it in a right way, to use proper spices and to make appropriate marinade sauce.</p><h3>

You see, different kinds of meat feature their own cooking temperature, at which all malignant bacteria are destroyed, while vitamins and taste are preserved. For a medium beef steak the temperature is about 150°F and a well-done steak requires more than 160°F.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479390572/mkktpmqlrdftyw7pzlxt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Lamb tastes perfect when cooked at 185°F, while pork reveals its best flavor at 195°F. And to get delicious dishes from chicken or poultry you need the highest temperature, about 200°F. And what is the way to determine the perfect moment, when your meat is ready? How can you be sure it’s neither dried nor raw?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469620803/aqlcq09jdohcsaua951q.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In the old-fashioned way you should take a knife, cut the meat and check its color and toughness.

But most of the thermometers, both mechanical and electronic, are not able to solve one great problem – they can’t relieve you from the necessity to constantly have an eye on the temperature they’re showing. None of the standard meat thermometers is capable of informing you about the moment when the inside temperature of the meat has amounted up the needed parameter, and that it is time to take the dish out of the oven or grill. </p><p> As a result, you have to stay in the kitchen or to haunt about the grill monitoring the process. You have no chance to leave your meal unattended and to join your family or friends in order to spend some time in their company. Sure, you may try, but then there is the risk that all the efforts to cook perfect meat will be in vain, since you can easily miss the right moment for taking the dish out.

Yes, it’s also important to choose a right slab of meat, to process it in a right way, to use proper spices and to make appropriate marinade sauce.
 Still, control over the temperature inside the meat plays a major role in proper cooking. You see, different kinds of meat feature their own cooking temperature, at which all malignant bacteria are destroyed, while vitamins and taste are preserved. For a medium beef steak the temperature is about 150°F and a well-done steak requires more than 160°F.Lamb tastes perfect when cooked at 185°F, while pork reveals its best flavor at 195°F. And to get delicious dishes from chicken or poultry you need the highest temperature, about 200°F. And what is the way to determine the perfect moment, when your meat is ready? How can you be sure it’s neither dried nor raw?In the old-fashioned way you should take a knife, cut the meat and check its color and toughness. But it’s much more convenient to use a meat thermometer that shows precise temperature inside your meat. Especially if you are about to make fish dishes... There are meat thermometers and there is iProbeYes, many of us use different types of meat thermometers to facilitate cooking process. But most of the thermometers, both mechanical and electronic, are not able to solve one great problem – they can’t relieve you from the necessity to constantly have an eye on the temperature they’re showing. None of the standard meat thermometers is capable of informing you about the moment when the inside temperature of the meat has amounted up the needed parameter, and that it is time to take the dish out of the oven or grill.  As a result, you have to stay in the kitchen or to haunt about the grill monitoring the process. You have no chance to leave your meal unattended and to join your family or friends in order to spend some time in their company. Sure, you may try, but then there is the risk that all the efforts to cook perfect meat will be in vain, since you can easily miss the right moment for taking the dish out. Is there any solution that can free you from the burden of watching meat while cooking it?Yes, now you get iProbe that is strikingly different from usual meat thermometers due to the use of advanced wireless technologies. It combines an electronic heat probe and a clever app that is downloaded to your smartphone, and completely changes your view of cooking process. You just need to insert the probe into the meat, to specify the required temperature via the app and to put the dish into the oven. You will get a message through your smartphone when the inside temperature run up the figures specified by you. Voila, you do not need to watch the meal and it always reaches the desired degree of doneness without being dried or burnt. You are a super chef and can cook meat as good as it’s cooked in the first class restaurants!Step-by-step – how it worksPrepare a cut of meat you are going to cook.  Take the probe out of the block and launch the application on your smartphone. The app supports iOS and Android based devices.Specify the kind of meat, the size of the cut and the necessary doneness via the app.Insert the probe into the meat keeping in mind that it should be placed as close to the center of the cut as possible. It is important for the accuracy of the temperature measurement to place the thermometer tip right in the heart of the cut, in its thickest part. If there is a bone in the meat, the tip should not come into contact with it. Then place the meat into the oven or on the grill leaving the probe to measure both inside and ambient temperature. In fact, iProbe features two temperature sensors, internal and external (the latter is designed for smoking and barbecue). During the cooking target, inside and outside temperatures are displayed via the app.The electronics inside the probe transmits data on the block, which, in turn, passes the information to the smartphone via your home Wi-Fi router. This cloud connection acts anywhere within the router coverage.Due to it, as soon as the inside temperature gets to the specified figures, the app will inform you via the smartphone by vibration, sound and message.Just take your meat out of the oven and savor the delicious taste of the restaurant quality food!10 Unbeaten advantages of iProbeIt is cheaper than to have dinner at a nice restaurant, even if you add the expenses for purchasing meat to its cost. And you save more than once since now you can enjoy perfectly cooked dishes every day instead of spending the budget for restaurants several times a month. iProbe with food iProbe with food You get the opportunity to accurately cook different types of meat such as tender chicken, juicy beef, smoked pork and even grilled fish. It is not a problem to cook steaks of any doneness starting from rare to well done. Note that the application allows you to choose both a type of meat and a size of the cut to make cooking more accurate. Having the outside sensor in addition to the internal one.iProbe is unbeatable for those types of food processing which require monitoring the temperature around the meals, like smoking. Eventually, you need only one thermometer instead of two. It is so easy-to-use, accurate in measurements and thoughtfully designed that even a person with minimal cooking skills will be able to achieve striking results every time when using iProbe. Almost no culinary experience is needed to impress your family or friends by your excellent meals. This innovative meat thermometer solves a major problem for you – you do not need to spend the time on just watching cooking process. You are free to join your friends, to watch TV, to play with children or to cook something else, staying assured that Iprobe monitors the temperature for you and will let you know about the end of the cooking just in time. Leave the meat in the oven and go doing other things. You can be master of your time, because Iprobe is able to calculate the approximate time of cooking, depending on the specified parameters. The app will inform you about how much time you have, so you can spend it, for example, for making some sauce or salad to the main course. There is no way to miss the notification as several kinds of signal are used, including a visual message, sound and vibration. In addition, you may configure the application to send the notification to some of your friends or family members you can rely on. Even if you're really engaged in something, you will not miss the moment. Don’t forget about resting! If you leave your meat in the oven for resting, it can become dry. To keep the meat juicy, allow iProbe to monitor the temperature, and it let you know when the resting reaches its goal. The wireless solution has a great advantage over wire meat thermometers since the wires don’t get on your way and you may not bother that water, high temperature or physical impact can damage them. The probe wire doesn’t allow to completely cover the food during cooking, which eliminates the possibility to use certain types of heat treatment, for example, Sous Vide. In addition, the wires get dirty and it is quite difficult to clean them from grease and traces of smoke, while the wireless thermometer is easy to clean and to store.All electronics are hidden within the thermometer and protected by a covering withstanding ambient temperature up to 375°F and internal temperature up to 165°F.

</div><p><b>Guerreros Teotihuacan Soccer School</b></p>
<p>Guerreros Teotihuacan A.C. is a Mexican federally registered
non-profit foundation located in Teotihuacan in central Mexico. Based close to
the 2000 year old pyramids, our primary goal is to foster indigenous identity
and consciousness in children and youth, girls and boys, through the practice
of sports and physical activity, as well as cultural and artistic activities.
At the center of our mission is a soccer school that daily welcomes up to 60
children of all ages and teaches them about core values that will help them in
life: honesty, respect, self-discipline, compassion and community.  We need your help to get these amazing kids to
Acapulco for an International Soccer tournament! </p>
<p><b>You can help make the team’s dream a reality!</b></p>
<p>The Guerreros Teotihuacan soccer school competes regularly in
local and regional leagues and tournaments, giving children on the school’s
teams the opportunity to grow and improve their self-confidence, as well as
broaden their perspective through exchange with children from other teams and
towns in the region. This summer, from July 15 to 21, the school is excited to
take the children a bit further afield for the first time.  We are headed to an International Soccer
Tournament in Acapulco – the Copa Acapulco – for children aged 11-12!  The kids are beyond excited by the prospect –
none of them have ever had the opportunity to travel that far from home.  This will also be a unique chance to meet
kids from teams from all over Mexico, as well as from the U.S. and Central
America. Our goal with this experience is not only that the kids get a chance
to compete and realize how amazing they are, but also that their vision opens
to future possibilities in their lives through this kind of sports/cultural
exchange – the sky is the limit! </p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We are fundraising to make sure this dream can
become a reality, because the children participating are low income and already
making a huge effort to attend training and regular season games. We need help
for tournament registration costs, transport from Teotihuacan to
Acapulco, as well as transport while there to games and events.
We also need help for hotel and meal costs, as well as uniforms.  We estimate the total of these costs to be
around $3500 that will cover all expenses for 15-20 children and their coach and assistant coach. </p><p><b>Dreaming Beyond the Acapulco Tournament</b></p><p>Any funds raised in excess of the immediate needs of the tournament will go into the general funds of the Guerreros Teotihuacan A.C. nonprofit foundation, to be used for other exciting opportunities for the kids.  Some of the needs are very basic - there are a number of children whose economic situation doesn't allow them to cover even the very low cost of the daily training program, so we provide them with full scholarships so that it is possible for them to participate in all the same opportunities.  We have also recently made an arrangement with a coach from one of Mexico City's professional teams (""America"") to come out to Teotihuacan once a week to provide a new level of vision and experience to the kids. Our most exciting project, for which we are also fundraising, is a plan to take 2 children per year to the United States on an all-expense paid scholarship trip to a soccer camp or cultural exchange.  We are so excited to be developing these plans and meeting these goals with your generous help! </p><p></p></div>","Guerreros Teotihuacan Soccer School

<h3>Consumer Reports recommends you avoid conventionally raised beef from feedlots and instead eat 100% grass-fed beef.</h3>
<ul><li>""The majority of beef (about 97 percent) for sale comes from “conventionally raised” cattle that begin their lives grazing in grassy pastures but are then shipped to and packed into feedlots. That practice is considered to be the most cost-efficient way to fatten up cattle.""</li></ul>
<ul><li>""In the feedlot corn and soy are the primary foods. But the cows may also be fed candy, chicken coop waste, and the slaughterhouse remains of pigs and chickens.""</li></ul>
<ul><li>""One of the most significant findings of our research is that beef from conventionally raised cows was more likely (2X) to have bacteria overall, as well as bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, than beef from sustainably raised cows (grass-fed).""</li></ul>

<ul><li>Only 1% of the total beef produced in the United States is 100% grass-fed.</li></ul>

<p>As a result it's impossible for most people to get 100% grass-fed beef and the few who can are often confused with supermarket labels or limited to just ground beef. Just because a label says grass-fed doesn't mean it's 100% grass-fed beef (all cattle are grass-fed to start!).</p>

<h3><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h3>
<p><b>How much meat comes in the box?</b></p>
<p>7 -10 lbs depending on the selection of cuts. There's enough meat for 15 - 20 individual meals at 6 - 8 oz portion sizes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>When will my box arrive?</b></p>
<p>Your box will arrive within 7 days of ordering on Indiegogo. We don't ship on Thursdays or Fridays because we don't want the box arriving on the weekend. Email us if you have questions: support@getbutcherbox.com</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is this a one-time purchase or am I put into an ongoing membership?</b></p>
<p>Your purchase on Indiegogo is a one-time purchase, however you'll have the option of joining ButcherBox as a monthly member if you'd like and we'd love to have you!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>So you choose what meat I receive monthly?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Our team spends countless hours curating the individual boxes you receive monthly. We choose the best possible combinations while ensuring a wide variety of high quality meats.  </p>
<p><b>If I choose a multi-month perk can I change what type of meat I receive for future months? </b></p>
<p>Yes. If for example you got a 6 month (all beef) perk but later decided that you wanted beef and organic chicken we can edit your membership at anytime. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where do you source your meat from?</b></p>
<p>All of our meat is sourced from various farms in the Midwest. We have partnered with amazing farms who are revolutionizing the grass-fed industry. Our meat is of the highest quality.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can you ship to Hawaii or Alaska?</b></p>
<p>Yes, but it costs an additional $25/month to help cover shipping costs. For example, if you select a 3 month membership then you'd need to add $75 to the $369 perk price. So your price would be $444. </p>
<p><b>How will my meat arrive?</b></p>
<p>Our meat is flash frozen at the peak of freshness and individually packaged. These packages are then separated based on cut type into cardboard boxes. The cardboard boxes are then packaged into a styrofoam box filled with dry ice. Once your box arrives, you will be able to take the cardboard boxes out of the styrofoam box and place the individual packages directly into your freezer.</p>
<p><b>Will my meat be fresh upon arrival?</b></p>
<p>All of our boxes are packaged with a specific amount of dry ice. The amount of dry ice is carefully calculated based on your geographic location. The dry ice may be completely evaporated by the time the box arrives at your house, but your meat should still be frozen or cold to the touch. The box can sit outside for 12-24 hours, so just make sure to bring it inside that day and refrigerate/freeze. </p>
<p><b>Can I specify a delivery date for my box?</b></p>
<p>Yes, after purchasing your perk, just email us instructions: <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">support@getbutcherbox.com</span></p>
<p><b>Does somebody need to be at home to accept delivery?</b></p>
<p>No. Our boxes do not require a signature upon delivery, however, we do recommend that you bring your box inside as soon as you can to ensure maximum freshness and high quality. Please let us know if you have any special requests for delivery.</p>

</div>","Hello! My name is Mike Salguero. I'm a health nut that spent the last 6 years running a company connecting craftsmen with individuals wanting something unique. I recently discovered a new problem: today's beef. I've been working with my team to bring America a better beef. We invite you to join us in this journey back to nature - it's gonna taste good.
Because we had such a smashing success on Kickstarter, we decided to share ButcherBox with you and the rest of the Indiegogo community! 














Consumer Reports recommends you avoid conventionally raised beef from feedlots and instead eat 100% grass-fed beef.
""The majority of beef (about 97 percent) for sale comes from “conventionally raised” cattle that begin their lives grazing in grassy pastures but are then shipped to and packed into feedlots. That practice is considered to be the most cost-efficient way to fatten up cattle.""
""In the feedlot corn and soy are the primary foods. But the cows may also be fed candy, chicken coop waste, and the slaughterhouse remains of pigs and chickens.""
""One of the most significant findings of our research is that beef from conventionally raised cows was more likely (2X) to have bacteria overall, as well as bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, than beef from sustainably raised cows (grass-fed).""




Only 1% of the total beef produced in the United States is 100% grass-fed.
100% grass-fed farms lack the resources necessary to advertise and distribute their beef.
As a result it's impossible for most people to get 100% grass-fed beef and the few who can are often confused with supermarket labels or limited to just ground beef. Just because a label says grass-fed doesn't mean it's 100% grass-fed beef (all cattle are grass-fed to start!).
Knowing where your beef comes from is no longer a 'nice to know', it's a 'need to know'.





Grass-fed beef delivered to your door for ~$7/meal

We've spent endless hours identifying and partnering with the best sources for 100% grass-fed beef. And we're proud to say that you now have a beef free of the bad and full of the good! 


What's in the Box?
Each box comes with a highly curated selection of 100% grass-fed beef cuts. For example, a box might come with top sirloin cuts, short ribs, ground beef, and sirloin tips. There's 15 - 20 individual meals worth of meat in every box at 6 - 8 oz portion sizes. To tell you exactly what's coming might ruin the surprise and nobody likes the guy who ruins the surprise. Your box will arrive within just 7 days of ordering!



You get the cuts and the recipes to cook like a pro
We chose popular cuts that we know you'll love cooking, as well as a few of our personal favorites. You'll also enjoy our step-by-step recipe cards that provide you with everything you'll need to deliver a perfect meal.


Think of us as the neighborhood butcher for modern America
Our goal is to make 100% grass-fed beef more accessible than ever before. We are working with industry experts to provide you with the best products and a simple ordering system. 


Your support will allow us to offer more types of meat and spread the 'back to nature' movement across America. 
By redeeming one of our rewards you're not locked into an ongoing monthly subscription. After you receive your shipment, you can become a monthly ButcherBox member if you'd like!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Carnegie Mellon University's premiere Quidditch team, the CMU Marauders!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>""Wait,"" we hear you saying, ""I thought Quidditch was the sport Harry Potter plays. Don't they fly around on broomsticks?""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Yes! But six years ago, a Muggle (non-magical) version of Quidditch was founded at Middlebury College, and we are joining a group of 100+ colleges around the nation who have established Quidditch teams. (Check out InternationalQuidditch.org for more about Quidditch.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our team was founded Spring 2011, but it really kicked off this semester. We have a club that practices and scrimmages every Friday, and we also have a competitive team of 12 who will be heading to the Quidditch World Cup in New York City this November!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>*Video will be up in the next week!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As a fledgling organization, we are struggling to get funds from the university. That's why we need your help! Our estimates put <font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#ff0000"">costs for the Quidditch World Cup at $250 per player. </font>That's more than any of us can afford, but we are determined to get there and represent our school and our love of the game! <font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#ff0000"">We hope to raise $100 for each of our 12 players. </font>This money will be used to pay for our transportation from Pittsburgh to New York and back, as well as secure us lodging in the City. (Unlike the wizards of Harry Potter, we are not allowed to take portkeys and camp out in magical tents.) Any little bit helps us in meeting this ambitious goal, so please, share this with your friends and family, anyone who might be willing to help a group of determined college students out - or maybe they just get a kick out of Muggle Quidditch! Any funds raised beyond our goal will be put to good use, purchasing much-needed equipment for our practices and scrimmages.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><strong>Hello friends! We are a group of five high school students that attend the middle college program at College of San Mateo. We were assigned to raise money for an organization that will help society or the world. We believe that healthcare is on the low, that is why our group chose to raise money for a free clinic. Given the ability that we have using this website, we wish to raise $400. We are hoping  to donate the $400 to the San Francisco Free Clinic, sffc.org. They provide p<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 16px; color: rgb(102,102,102);"">reventive health care, cancer and heart disease screening, Diabetes care, Vaccinations, Treatment of non-emergency acute and chronic medical problems, Yoga for health and mental well-being. The San Francisco Free Clinic was created in 1993 by two family physicians that realized, many people who don't have healthcare go without any medical care.</span></strong><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Our campaign will impact the lives of people in San Francisco whom cannot afford healthcare. In the case that our campaign doesn't work, the clinic won't get the money, then they wont be able to buy supplies, so then they can't help the patients and they could potentially die. When we raise the money for the clinic we will give them the opportunity to buy supplies to treat  patients and keep the clinic running. </strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal given to us by our teachers is $400, but that doesn't matter when we are trying to help save peoples lives, raising more than $400 would be amazing! By donating money you will get the satisfaction of giving people less fortunate, the chance to stay healthy and live a better life. How much more rewarding can it get?</strong><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>You can't do more than give what you can. You can always visit the Free Clinic's website to see what else you can do to contribute. </strong></p>

<p>Just a 15 minute workout a day, will do more for you mentally, physically,and spiritually than any system on the market right now.</p>

<h2><strong>                                Tantric Yoga</strong></h2>
<p> Tantra means continuous or ongoing loom (union) and is in reference to energy transfer within a cycle. As an individual this concept can be displayed in meditations such as the micro and macro cosmic orbit. Within a relationship it is the ongoing transfer of energy between intimate partners.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>It is well known that love is one of the highest emotional frequencies of energy-with this in mind, it is no wonder that <strong>intimacy</strong> with two intuned partners is the fastest way to enlightenment and ultimate health.</p>
<p>                                                 </p>

<h3>                                <strong>How love heals the body:</strong>
</h3>
<p>True love cannot be expressed with words, formulas or equations, as an alchemist ive worked painstakingly trying to figure out the natural essence of the phenomina known as love. There is a chemical mixture of hormones present with ability to keep you <strong>younger looking, healthier, happy, more energetic.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>enhanced dopamine (relaxation)</li>
<li>more seratonin in the blood stream (feel good chemical)</li>
<li>increased Human Growth Hormone (more efficient cell regeneration)</li>
<li>Lymphocytes (heals and fights infections)</li>
<li>Norepinephrine (raised energy level)</li>
<li>Testosterone (burns fat, builds muscle tissue, increases desire &amp; stamina)</li>
<li>Triiodothyronine (helps to regulate metabolism)            </li>
</ol><p>                   <strong>           </strong></p>
<p><strong> Above are some of the major hormones present, when love is experienced. Being that everything is in constant flux, moving further away from balance. Below is the invention of an all-natural magnetic device with the power to place your body in a hieghtened state of <strong>joy, health and positive growth.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>                                       <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>                                                Natural Magnetic Healing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Attract all that you want out of life-Nothing attracts better than a magnet.<br/></strong></p>

<p>The Earth serves as a giant magnet and supports over 9 billion people with shelter, sustenance, medicinal herbs, water, and all that we use everyday. It only makes sense that a device capable of transformong your life for the better; utilizes natural magnetic technology.</p>

Just a 15 minute workout a day, will do more for you mentally, physically,and spiritually than any system on the market right now.
 
 
                                Tantric Yoga
 Tantra means continuous or ongoing loom (union) and is in reference to energy transfer within a cycle. As an individual this concept can be displayed in meditations such as the micro and macro cosmic orbit. Within a relationship it is the ongoing transfer of energy between intimate partners.
 
                                   Love conquers all
                        
 
It is well known that love is one of the highest emotional frequencies of energy-with this in mind, it is no wonder that intimacy with two intuned partners is the fastest way to enlightenment and ultimate health.
                                                 
                        
                                How love heals the body:

True love cannot be expressed with words, formulas or equations, as an alchemist ive worked painstakingly trying to figure out the natural essence of the phenomina known as love. There is a chemical mixture of hormones present with ability to keep you younger looking, healthier, happy, more energetic.

enhanced dopamine (relaxation)
more seratonin in the blood stream (feel good chemical)
increased Human Growth Hormone (more efficient cell regeneration)
Lymphocytes (heals and fights infections)
Norepinephrine (raised energy level)
Testosterone (burns fat, builds muscle tissue, increases desire & stamina)
Triiodothyronine (helps to regulate metabolism)            
                              
 Above are some of the major hormones present, when love is experienced. Being that everything is in constant flux, moving further away from balance. Below is the invention of an all-natural magnetic device with the power to place your body in a hieghtened state of joy, health and positive growth.
                                       
                                                Natural Magnetic Healing
Attract all that you want out of life-Nothing attracts better than a magnet.
                           
The Earth serves as a giant magnet and supports over 9 billion people with shelter, sustenance, medicinal herbs, water, and all that we use everyday. It only makes sense that a device capable of transformong your life for the better; utilizes natural magnetic technology.

</div></div>","Hello everyone, I’m Johnny Mallon.
 
If you’re a golf fan, imagine how you'd feel if you had helped British Open Champion Darren Clarke to start his career, or imagine if you’d played an important part in Rory McElroy’s phenomenal success.
 
So, even if you’re not a golf fan, what a claim to fame that would be.
 
Well… here’s your chance to help launch my career and follow in the footsteps of all Irish golf champions.
 
…And better still, you’ll be rewarded for your help.
 


 
 
I’m a professional golfer from Ireland. 
I’m working towards becoming a European and  PGA Tour Player and with your help I’m raising $26,000 to fund the first step of the journey.
 
I’m giving every one of you fantastic 
rewards for your contributions.
 
For example, how would you like to take 3 of your friends and join me at major tournament with VIP access..., rubbing shoulders with the worlds golfing stars, like Tiger Woods or Lee Westwood…
…or, be my caddie for the day at a European or PGA Tour event...
…or own a Tour golf bag from my first Year on Tour… 
…I’m also giving you my personal coaching advice to improve your golf swing, and giving you private and personal monthly updates to build on your progress…
…And, I’m giving every single one of you something very unique and personal.
 
Check out all the rewards on the right-hand side of your screen.

 


 
So why does a professional golfer like me 
need funding to reach the top level?
 
Well… if you’re not already familiar with the process, 
here’s how it works:
 
All Pro golfers need funding to take their first steps towards the big time. This sponsorship money pays for travel, hotel and food, and entry fees to tournaments. Without funding a Pro golfer wouldn’t be able to attend and play in these tournaments.
 
Traditionally most young Pro golfers got their funding from local business, or friends and family.
But, today’s tough economy means local sponsors are almost non-existent.
 
Just think…what will happen to the game if young professional golfers don’t have the chance to break through to the top level…what if we had never had the chance to enjoy Rory McElroy, Darren Clarke, Tiger Woods, or Ernie Els? 
 
So I’m determined to break through and 
achieve my goals so I need your help.
 
After all, it’s the regular everyday golfers that keep the sport alive, and your interest in the sport that turns major players into household names.
 

Here’s how your contributions will be used:
 
From April, the money will be used to enter and attend various tournaments on the Europro Tour and Jamega Tour.
 
Your funding will pay for the entry fees, and 
travel and accommodation for all of these events.
 
My aim is that the winnings from these tournaments will fund my next step to move up the ranks in September this year, which means I would be a member of the Challenge Tour from January 2013. 
A good performance here means I automatically qualify for the “European Tour”….and that’s the top level.
 


So how do you know if I’m any good?

Well, here’s the story so far:
 
·      I started playing at age 10
·      Darren Clarke spotted my potential and paid my sponsorship to The Sports Academy at age 18  (www.thesportsacademy.org)
·      At The Sports Academy I was selected for the UK team to play Spain in a Ryder Cup style 3 day tournament…I was the highest scoring player on the tournament
·      I was the first player ever to be voted Junior and Senior Player of the Year in the same year, at my club, Dungannon Golf Club, where Darren Clarke started his career
·      First time attending Europro tour school at 20 years old, I qualified 3rd out of 116 players
·      That year I could only afford to enter 4 Euro Pro tournaments and I made the cut in 3 and only missed the cut on the 4th by a single shot
·      I been coached by some of the world best
o  Stuart Fomes - High Performance Coach and Sports Psychologist 
o  Rob Page – TPI Fitness Coach (level 3)
o  Dave March – Swing Coach
o  I’m now being coached by Mike Bannon, Rory McElroys coach

 
All young golf professionals need the helping hand at the start of their careers. 

All the famous players we admire that have entertained and amazed us over the years all needed financial support to get them up an running.
 
Now it’s your chance to make a difference and I’m so grateful for your support.

So…please contribute what you can and I look forward to sending you my personal rewards. 
 
Have a good look through all the rewards over on the right hand side of the screen. By the way i would like to make the rewards as personal as i can for each of you so if there is anything you would like added or taken away from the rewards please don't be shy and drop me an email and i will do my best to accommodate you.
 
I’ll be keeping you up to date right through this campaign. Please check out my blog at johnnymallongolf.com.
Also you can join me on facebook, twitter and youtube where I’ll be dishing out some fantastic golfing tips along the way.
 
Again guys thanks so much for taking the time to listen. Please spread the word to your friends and family and I look forward to talking with you again soon.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>I thought it was a simple broken foot...</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!  My name is Michelle Deputy.  I am a 23 year old Jersey girl, Penn State alum and a Kappa Delta. </p>
<p>In January 2007, I was dancing to country music in my kitchen with my family, when I rolled my ankle and broke my right foot.  My doctor put me in a foot cast for 8 weeks, and before I knew it, I was ready to graduate high school.</p>
<p>As anyone who has ever been to Penn State knows, there is a lot of walking, and during my first semester I started to notice that my right foot was constantly swollen and <span>occasionally </span>became painful.  I went to my doctor, and he told me that I had a neuroma (a cluster of nerves in between the bones), which was the source of my pain.</p>
<p>When I couldn't take the pain anymore, I decided to have surgery to remove my neuroma in June 2010.  However, the neuroma grew back, so I had it removed again in May 2011.  And again in September 2011.</p>
<p>Even with all of these surgeries, physical therapy and different procedures, my pain continued to get worse.  The pain was more constant and severe and made it impossible for me to stand or walk for long periods of time.  Also, it started to hurt to physically touch my foot.  Even something as simple as putting my sock on became a torturous task.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Things got serious...</h3>
<p>In September 2011, my doctor told me that there was something more serious going on.  After more tests and a lot more visits to a bunch of new doctors, I was diagnosed with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) or Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).</p>
<p>RSD is a neurological disorder with no known cure, which, lucky for me, means that I may have to live with this for the rest of my life.  Also, since it is nerve related, there is an extremely high rate of the pain transferring to my other foot or to both of my hands.  A doctor who <span>specializes </span>in RSD told me that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">there are already signs of the RSD spreading to my left foot and both of my hands</span>.</p>
<p>Since I could no longer stand without crying, I had to quit my job and move back home with my parents.</p>
<p>I started physical therapy again, but after three months and no improvement, we decided to stop.  I then had a Sympathetic Nerve Block in December 2011, but that didn't help either.  In February 2012, I had a trial Spinal Cord Stimulator put into my back for five days to see if the stimulation could override the pain signals, but instead it just made the pain worse.</p>
<p>Running out of options, my mom and dad took me for experimental Calmare Therapy.  Since the technology is relatively new, the insurance company would not pay for it, and we had to pay $1,000 out of pocket.  We also had to drive an hour and ten minutes to and from Staten Island everyday for 10 days in a row.  Again, I had no relief from my pain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My life with RSD...</h3>
<p>The hardest part about having RSD is that most people don't know about it.  People see me in a foot cast and usually assume that I broke my foot.  </p>
<p>Since I look healthy, people don't realize that I am in constant, unbearable, excruciating pain.  They don't understand that the idea of driving a car or going to the mall or doing anything that a normal 23 year old should do brings me to tears, because I know that within 15 minutes I will be in so much pain that I will have trouble breathing.  </p>
<p>They don't understand why I can't work or why I never want to leave the house.  They don't believe that when my bed sheet hits my foot at night that I need to scream out in pain.  They don't realize how much my family, boyfriend and friends sacrifice everyday to make sure that I am comfortable.</p>
<p>For years, RSD has made every second of every day of my life hard to live.  </p>
<p>However, it has also made me realize who I can really count on, who my true friends are, and how important my faith in God is.  And I am thankful for that every day.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Ketamine Infusion...</h3>
<p>On September 10th to September 21st of 2012, I will be going for a 10 day Ketamine Infusion in Philadelphia (besides the weekends).  This infusion will, in layman's terms, help to reset my nervous system and make my brain stop or slow the pain signal that it sends to my foot.</p>
<p>The infusion is 4 hours a day, so everyday my parents, boyfriend, sisters (and brother-in-laws) and friends will drive me to Philadelphia so that I can get my infusion.  Unfortunately, no one is allowed in the room with me while I have to get this done, which means that it will be pretty scary having to do this alone.  </p>
<p>The biggest problem with the infusion is that my insurance company doesn't cover the costs because it is considered to be experimental.</p>
<p>The total 10 day cost is $5,000.  After the 10 days, I will need to go back for four 2-day booster sessions.  Each 2 day booster session is an additional $1,000, bringing my total cost to $9,000.  </p>
<p>If the ketamine infusion is successful, I will continue to need two or three 2-day booster infusion sessions.  Each 2-day booster session is $1,000 and I will need these booster sessions for many years to come.</p>
<p>Since I cannot work, it makes it basically impossible for me to pay this by myself.  My parents, however, are amazing and have taken on the cost of this infusion.  It is huge, unplanned expense.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How you can help...</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for reading about my journey for RSD.  As I have said, I need $9,000 to get my ketamine infusion (and I will continue to need many booster sessions for many years that are $1,000 per 2-day session).  This infusion will help give me my life back!</p>
<p>Any donations will go directly to help pay for my infusion.  Please feel free to spread the word, not only about my infusion, but about RSD.  The more people that know about it, the more people that can be helped.</p>

<h3>November 24, 2012 I officially became married to and a part of my 
husband's family in India.  They have showed me more kindness, more 
total acceptance and wild generosity as they welcomed me into their 
family than I have ever experienced in my whole life.  Living with them 
has taught me incredible things. <br/><br/> I want to give back.  My husband's mother has had kidney failure and has been on dialysis f<span>or
 over a year.  There is no subsidized medical care in India and the 
responsibility of medical bills falls solely on the family members.  
Three times a week they take her to the nearest dialysis center, an 
hour's drive by car, to get treatment.  Up until now they have been 
using their family savings, but they are very near the end of their 
savings.  Her condition is serious and life threatening without 
treatment.   <br/><br/> So we are raising money.  The cost of medicine, 
injections, dialysis and transportation to the dialysis center costs 
only around $80 per visit, 3 times per week costs around $1000 per 
month!   I figured that if a few people could give just $15 - $20 per 
month (the cost of 4-5 lattes), we would have enough to cover her

</h3></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","November 24, 2012 I officially became married to and a part of my 
husband's family in India.  They have showed me more kindness, more 
total acceptance and wild generosity as they welcomed me into their 
family than I have ever experienced in my whole life.  Living with them 
has taught me incredible things.  I want to give back.  My husband's mother has had kidney failure and has been on dialysis for
 over a year.  There is no subsidized medical care in India and the 
responsibility of medical bills falls solely on the family members.  
Three times a week they take her to the nearest dialysis center, an 
hour's drive by car, to get treatment.  Up until now they have been 
using their family savings, but they are very near the end of their 
savings.  Her condition is serious and life threatening without 
treatment.    So we are raising money.  The cost of medicine, 
injections, dialysis and transportation to the dialysis center costs 
only around $80 per visit, 3 times per week costs around $1000 per 
month!   I figured that if a few people could give just $15 - $20 per 
month (the cost of 4-5 lattes), we would have enough to cover her 
treatments.  Give as little or as much as you like, every little bit 
counts and helps.   We are so grateful.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Q1. Can I keep the Night Shift after the conclusion of the study?</b><br/>
A. Yes. You can keep your Night Shift if you obtain a prescription from your physician. Or we can assist you in
obtaining a prescription when you complete the study.</p>
<p><b>Q2. Will my health insurance cover the cost of the Night Shift?</b><br/>
A. If you provide us: a) your sleep study report that shows your overall severity is at least 5 events/hour, b) a prescription from your physician, and c) your medical billing information, we will assist you with reimbursement. If you have PPO insurance, the reimbursement amount (which will be returned to you) may cover up to 100% of your Health Tracker contribution. <a href=""https://advancedbrainmonitoring.app.box.com/s/xtt5wja81knie79yxq8y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> to learn more about reimbursement.</p>
<p><b>Q3. What if I don’t use Night Shift every night?</b><br/>
A. There is no requirement to use Night Shift every night. A goal of this study is to evaluate how consistently users wear the Night Shift. </p>
<p><b>Q4. What if I want to stop using Night Shift?</b><br/>
A. Even if you stop using Night Shift, you need to generate a Report at the end of 3-months and 6-months to complete the study.</p>
<p><b>Q5. Why must I sign a Consent Form?</b><br/>
A. A consent form is required to participate in a study. Signing the consent form informs you of the risks and your rights as a participant.</p>
<p><b>Q6. What are the risks of using Night Shift? </b><br/>
A. The greatest risk (as described in the Consent Form) is that you assume Night Shift is treating your sleep apnea but it is not.  We strongly recommend and provide assistance for you to undergo a follow-up sleep study to mitigate this concern.</p>
<p><b>Q7. How do I know if I am a good candidate for Night Shift Therapy?</b><br/>
A. If you were previously diagnosed with Sleep Apnea you are a <i>good</i> candidate for Night Shift Therapy if:
</p><ul>
<li>Your sleep study report shows your “supine” sleep apnea severity is two times your severity when you don’t sleep on your back (i.e., supine apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is twice as high as your non-supine AHI)</li>
<li>Your overall AHI severity is less than 30 if the supine AHI is not provided</li>
</ul><p><b>Q8. Who is NOT a good candidate for Night Shift Therapy?</b><br/>
A. If you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea and your overall AHI is greater than 60 or if you are not certain you have positional sleep apnea (please consult with your physician before enrolling).</p>
<p><b>Q9. What health conditions limit me from using the device?</b><br/>
A. We recommend that Night Shift is not used on patients who:
</p><ul>
<li>suffer from tics or tremors of the head</li>
<li>suffer from cardiac arrhythmia corrected by an artificial pace-maker</li>
<li>have neck less than 12 inches (30 cm) or greater than 22 inches (55 cm)</li>
<li>are currently suffering from neck, shoulder, or back pain</li>
<li>have an open cut or wound near the neck (you may need to temporarily discontinue use)</li>
</ul><p><b>Q10. What if I can’t fall asleep unless I am on my back? </b><br/>
A. Night Shift delays the start of therapy for 15 minutes after the device is turned on in order to give you time to fall asleep on your back. If you need more time, you can use the Report Portal to increase the delay to 30 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Q11. Won’t the delivery of position therapy interrupt my sleep?</b><br/>
A. If you have sleep apnea, you may experience fewer interruptions than you do now. In the previous study of Night Shift for prescription use, both brief arousals, as well as awakenings, were significantly reduced because patients slept more 
deeply. Users recalled position avoidance therapy on average twice per night, yet they attempted to sleep supine on average seven times per night.</p>
<p><b>Q12. What do I have to do to maintain the Night Shift?</b><br/>
A. Night Shift should be charged before use.  We include a cable that is compatible with a USB charger. The device must be recharged at least once every three days. When it is turned on, it vibrates to indicate the number of nights it can be worn before it must be recharged. It will also indicate when the battery is too low to provide therapy for 8 hours. We recommend that the strap is washed in dish soap and the enclosure wiped with alcohol routinely to keep it clean.</p>
<p><b>Q13. How do I know whether I have sleep apnea or am simply a snorer?</b><br/>
A. The only way to determine this is to have a sleep study. We can assist you in obtaining a home sleep study or you can obtain a referral from your physician to a sleep study provider. In most cases, the cost of the sleep study will be covered by medical insurance.</p>
<p><b>Q14. Can I obtain a Night Shift without participating in the study?</b><br/>A. Once the study is completed, the Night Shift will become available by prescription. <br/></p>
<p><b>Q15. Do you have information about Night Shift that I can share with my physician when I get my prescription? </b><br/>
A. Yes, we can provide the <a href=""https://advancedbrainmonitoring.box.com/s/dj8n07kz5yw00bwewz43"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">abstracts</a> and links, when published, to two clinical studies. </p>
<p><b>Q16. How do I know the privacy of my health and reimbursement information is protected?</b><br/>
A. To ensure your safety and protect your patient health information, our ""Information Technology Plan"" has been approved by the National Institute of Health and the consent form and survey were approved by an Independent Review Board.</p>
<p><b>Q17. Does the Night Shift include a warranty?</b><br/>
A. Yes, Night Shift includes a two-year warranty covering workmanship problems related to the electronics. The battery and haptic motors carry a one-year warranty and can be replaced after one year for a $50 fee. The neck strap should be replaced every six months and will cost $15. Night Shift is medical device that is not water-proof, pet-proof, or mistake-proof. The warranty is void if you do not treat your Night Shift with care.</p><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Q18. If I order a Star Treatment, how will that work?</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">A.  You will be contacted by email to arrange your pre-treatment sleep study.  A home sleep test device will be shipped to your home or residence.  We recommend you wear the device for two nights to provide the most accurate assessment.  An envelope and return shipping label will be provided with the device. Approximately two weeks after the device is returned, we will email you your results and arrange for your consultation with Dr. Westbrook.  This process will be repeated approximately 3-months after you’ve been using Night Shift</span></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Q19.
If I order an Executive Package, how does that work?</b></p>
<p>A.  You will be contacted by email so you can
schedule your trips to Carlsbad.  You will be responsible for your travel
expenses. Your comprehensive assessment will begin at 9 AM.  It will
include test battery of neuro-psychology tasks with simultaneous acquisition of
your brain's electrical activity.  Your session will include mental focus
training which we developed for soldiers.  Your session will end around
12:30 PM.  Approximately 3-months after you began your therapy, you will
be retested. You will be emailed a comprehensive Alertness, Memory and
Executive Function Profile report approximately 3-weeks after your follow-up
session.</p>

Why Participate
Snoring and sleep apnea are signs of an abnormal, collapsing upper airway. Snoring and sleep apnea not only affect your health, but they also impact your bed-partner’s happiness. A non-snorer in a marriage loses about an hour of sleep each night, while snoring is reportedly the number one medical cause for divorce.
Sleep apnea and snoring are common in both men and women; almost 100% of those with sleep apnea snore. Sleep apnea causes fragmentation of sleep and inadequate oxygenation of the brain, heart, and other tissues.
Consequences of Sleep Apnea

Over 70% of those with sleep apnea are at least twice as severe while sleeping on their back (positional sleep apnea), and as many as 65% of non-apneic snorers snore loudest while on their back (positional snorer).
Positional Solution
Night Shift is a medical device designed to treat positional snoring and sleep apnea. Worn on the back of the neck, it is secured in place with a medical grade silicone strap and magnetic clasp. Night Shift begins to gently vibrate when you start to sleep on your back. The vibration slowly increases in intensity until you change positions.
Night Shift is also an intelligent, interactive monitor that measures sleep quality and the frequency of unhealthy loud snoring. The internet-based Report Portal enables you to monitor the effectiveness of the therapy and its improvements on your sleep quality.

The Night Shift technology allows you to confirm you are being effectively treated for sleep apnea and snoring. Use the Monthly and Daily Night Shift Reports to:

FAQ
Q1. Can I keep the Night Shift after the conclusion of the study?
A. Yes. You can keep your Night Shift if you obtain a prescription from your physician. Or we can assist you in
obtaining a prescription when you complete the study.
Q2. Will my health insurance cover the cost of the Night Shift?
A. If you provide us: a) your sleep study report that shows your overall severity is at least 5 events/hour, b) a prescription from your physician, and c) your medical billing information, we will assist you with reimbursement. If you have PPO insurance, the reimbursement amount (which will be returned to you) may cover up to 100% of your Health Tracker contribution. Click here to learn more about reimbursement.
Q3. What if I don’t use Night Shift every night?
A. There is no requirement to use Night Shift every night. A goal of this study is to evaluate how consistently users wear the Night Shift. 
Q4. What if I want to stop using Night Shift?
A. Even if you stop using Night Shift, you need to generate a Report at the end of 3-months and 6-months to complete the study.
Q5. Why must I sign a Consent Form?
A. A consent form is required to participate in a study. Signing the consent form informs you of the risks and your rights as a participant.
Q6. What are the risks of using Night Shift? 
A. The greatest risk (as described in the Consent Form) is that you assume Night Shift is treating your sleep apnea but it is not.  We strongly recommend and provide assistance for you to undergo a follow-up sleep study to mitigate this concern.
Q7. How do I know if I am a good candidate for Night Shift Therapy?
A. If you were previously diagnosed with Sleep Apnea you are a good candidate for Night Shift Therapy if:

Your sleep study report shows your “supine” sleep apnea severity is two times your severity when you don’t sleep on your back (i.e., supine apnea hypopnea index (AHI) is twice as high as your non-supine AHI)
Your overall AHI severity is less than 30 if the supine AHI is not provided
Q8. Who is NOT a good candidate for Night Shift Therapy?
A. If you have been diagnosed with sleep apnea and your overall AHI is greater than 60 or if you are not certain you have positional sleep apnea (please consult with your physician before enrolling).
Q9. What health conditions limit me from using the device?
A. We recommend that Night Shift is not used on patients who:

suffer from tics or tremors of the head
suffer from cardiac arrhythmia corrected by an artificial pace-maker
have neck less than 12 inches (30 cm) or greater than 22 inches (55 cm)
are currently suffering from neck, shoulder, or back pain
have an open cut or wound near the neck (you may need to temporarily discontinue use)
Q10. What if I can’t fall asleep unless I am on my back? 
A. Night Shift delays the start of therapy for 15 minutes after the device is turned on in order to give you time to fall asleep on your back. If you need more time, you can use the Report Portal to increase the delay to 30 minutes.
Q11. Won’t the delivery of position therapy interrupt my sleep?
A. If you have sleep apnea, you may experience fewer interruptions than you do now. In the previous study of Night Shift for prescription use, both brief arousals, as well as awakenings, were significantly reduced because patients slept more 
deeply. Users recalled position avoidance therapy on average twice per night, yet they attempted to sleep supine on average seven times per night.
Q12. What do I have to do to maintain the Night Shift?
A. Night Shift should be charged before use.  We include a cable that is compatible with a USB charger. The device must be recharged at least once every three days. When it is turned on, it vibrates to indicate the number of nights it can be worn before it must be recharged. It will also indicate when the battery is too low to provide therapy for 8 hours. We recommend that the strap is washed in dish soap and the enclosure wiped with alcohol routinely to keep it clean.
Q13. How do I know whether I have sleep apnea or am simply a snorer?
A. The only way to determine this is to have a sleep study. We can assist you in obtaining a home sleep study or you can obtain a referral from your physician to a sleep study provider. In most cases, the cost of the sleep study will be covered by medical insurance.
Q14. Can I obtain a Night Shift without participating in the study?A. Once the study is completed, the Night Shift will become available by prescription. 
Q15. Do you have information about Night Shift that I can share with my physician when I get my prescription? 
A. Yes, we can provide the abstracts and links, when published, to two clinical studies. 
Q16. How do I know the privacy of my health and reimbursement information is protected?
A. To ensure your safety and protect your patient health information, our ""Information Technology Plan"" has been approved by the National Institute of Health and the consent form and survey were approved by an Independent Review Board.
Q17. Does the Night Shift include a warranty?
A. Yes, Night Shift includes a two-year warranty covering workmanship problems related to the electronics. The battery and haptic motors carry a one-year warranty and can be replaced after one year for a $50 fee. The neck strap should be replaced every six months and will cost $15. Night Shift is medical device that is not water-proof, pet-proof, or mistake-proof. The warranty is void if you do not treat your Night Shift with care.Q18. If I order a Star Treatment, how will that work?A.  You will be contacted by email to arrange your pre-treatment sleep study.  A home sleep test device will be shipped to your home or residence.  We recommend you wear the device for two nights to provide the most accurate assessment.  An envelope and return shipping label will be provided with the device. Approximately two weeks after the device is returned, we will email you your results and arrange for your consultation with Dr. Westbrook.  This process will be repeated approximately 3-months after you’ve been using Night ShiftQ19.
If I order an Executive Package, how does that work?
A.  You will be contacted by email so you can
schedule your trips to Carlsbad.  You will be responsible for your travel
expenses. Your comprehensive assessment will begin at 9 AM.  It will
include test battery of neuro-psychology tasks with simultaneous acquisition of
your brain's electrical activity.  Your session will include mental focus
training which we developed for soldiers.  Your session will end around
12:30 PM.  Approximately 3-months after you began your therapy, you will
be retested. You will be emailed a comprehensive Alertness, Memory and
Executive Function Profile report approximately 3-weeks after your follow-up
session.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>On February 17, 2013, Nick Francescutti was in a snowmobiling accident while vacationing in the Adirondack Mountains.  After a long rescue effort, Nick was airlifted to Fletcher Allen hospital in Burlington, VT.  While his injuries were extremely serious, Nick’s recovery has astonished his family, friends, and doctors up to this point. </h3>
<h3>Nick’s will to improve has been amazing.  In the accident, he sustained injuries that most wouldn’t survive including a broken neck, the partial loss of his leg, and other serious, but less severe injuries.  Though he has overcome so much in such a short time already, Nick has a great deal of recovery and hurdles to overcome in his future.  </h3>
<h3>As a member of the United States Border Patrol, Nick is a person of amazing character, integrity and possesses kindness that most could only hope for.  Nick joined the patrol immediately after college and has been protecting and serving our nation on both the Southern and Northern United States borders ever since.</h3>
<h3>To help Nick with his recovery effort we are reaching out to anyone willing to donate.  <em><strong>All</strong></em> donations will go directly to Nick’s recovery to help with upcoming medical expenses and needs. Our goal is $1000 and hopefully, with everyone’s support and help we can reach it!  </h3>

<p>      My name is LeeAnn Harris I launched this campaign to help my best friend Severina Turner and her family. If I was in a place to help her myself I would, but I can't so I am asking you to help do what I cannot.</p>
<p>     On June 19th Severina woke up with a stomach ache, she thought it was something she ate and didnt think anything of it. After napping most of the day to try and feel better the pain was pretty bad and her boyfriend Josh took her to the ER. They took her blood pressure and immediatly admitted her. She had developed pre-eclampsia, which is basically extremely high blood pressure that can cut off blood flow to the baby. The hospital tried to stop it but they ended up taking Seve to an emergency C-section at only 25 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>    Adelee Kay Poppe was born that night and weighed 1lb 2.9 oz. against all odds she had no major issues and has been showing her strength ever since. Doctors and nurses were impressed with her progess and lack of problems that most premature babies her size ususally go through. During her 3 month stay at Benefis Hospital she had one minor blood infection and was on oxygen only to supplement her breathing because she was so small but was breathing on her own. They sent Adelee home to be with Seve, Josh, and her big sister Tabitha on September 11th, she was almost 5lbs by then.</p>
<p>   Everything was going well the first week home on September 17th Seve was holding Adelee in her nursery when Adelee went limp and quit breathing. Seve's mom called 911 while Seve performed CPR on her daughter until the paramedics arrived and were able to revive her on the way to the hospital. Once they revived her, Adelee went back to being a healthy and happy baby so after a few days and nothing popping up on tests and scans they sent her home again. A few days later on September 25th Adelee felt cold and wasn't eating well so Seve and Josh took her to the ER as a precaution and as they walked into the hospital Adelee quit breathing and went limp again. Once the doctors revived her was fine but she did test for RSV, which can be fatal for preemies so they kept her for a few more days and she was doing fine so they sent her home again.</p>
<p>  On October 5th Seve noticed Adelee was being lethargic again so she took her to the pediatrician and they were admitted to the hospital again. Her little lungs had taken a hit from the RSV and she wasn't getting rid of the Co2 in her lungs on her own.</p>
<p>   Adelee has been transported to Seattle and is currently sedated and paralyzed because the new ventilator she is on vibrates her gently to help get the Co2 out of her lungs. Also being sedated allows her body to focus on healing since she was working so hard the right side of her heart has become enlarged from working overtime. There is no name or condition so far for what is going with Adelee.</p>
<p>  This is where I am asking for your help. Seve and Josh were in the process of buying a house when Adelee was born and have worked to make it a home for their family. Seve works at Chillis in Great Falls and went back to work while Adelee was in the hospital after being born then took her maternity leave when Adelee was sent home the first time, while Josh continued working. Obviously this is not the typical maternity leave and it can be hard for any family to lose an income for awhile but to go through this and have the stress of bills and a new house shouldn't be something that they have to worry about. I am asking for your help to raise $3000 to help these wonderful people be able to concentrate on their daughter and not how quickly they will have to go back to work.</p>
<p>  I hope you can find it in your heart to help and those of you who know this family know that it is going to good people who deserve some help during a difficult time.</p>

<h1><b>Inversion Therapy </b></h1>
<p>The sole act of hanging upside down
 on the sling unloads the spine: thus relieving pressure on nerve roots 
due to poor postural habits, lack of proper stretching &amp; exercise 
and the effects of gravity and our own body weight. Inversion alleviates
 muscle tension, neck &amp; back pain, promotes increased joint 
mobility, flexibility, relaxation and increased circulation of blood, 
lymph &amp; energy. It is an incredible anti-stress and anti-aging 
practice – we like to call it a “natural botox.”</p>
<p>The Yogena™ 
suspension system is an inversion sling that allows you to suspend in an
 inverted position with your pelvis and leg muscles bearing your body 
weight. This position eliminates all gravitational 
compression. Inversion therapy is the safest, quickest and most 
effective way to increase the space between your vertebrae. Numerous 
clinical studies published in reputable medical journals have 
confirmed that inversion really does increase the separation between 
the discs of the spine, which brings relief from back pain. </p>

<p>The Yogena Inversion Sling is a patent pending (<b>USPTO Application # 61/853,846</b>) recreational hammock &amp; inversion sling 
that can be used as a yoga prop, a suspension trainer and can be used indoors or outdoors. The
 hammock weights only 5 lbs, comes with its own bag and can be set up in
 less than 2 minutes on any support beam or two points that are strong 
enough to hold your weight. The hammock is made from parachute nylon and
 polyester webbing and can hold up to 700 lbs.

</p>
<p>It comes with 4  carabiners (strength 12 kN or 2,697 lbs each) 
and includes 2 daisy chains (4.5 feet each) with 22 pockets.The actual 
length of the hammock fabric is 92 inches and width is 48 inches. It can
 comfortably accommodate one person; however, we have also put two 
people in the hammock and it was ok. </p>
<p>There are plastic adjusters 
on both sides of the hammock that can be used to adjust the availability
 of fabric and as such, the hammock can be used as a yoga prop for 
suspension yoga and spinal decompression. The user can invert 180 
degrees in 3 easy steps using the handles to support the user's body 
weight while inverting.</p>
<p>All it needs are 2 suspension points

 Intro & Overview


Hi. My name is Christine.I'm a pretty interesting person in search of funding for a corrective surgery (Sacroiliac Joint Fixation) to help me alleviate near-constant pain and bodily dysfunction, so that I may reintegrate into a more productive life for both self and others. Though I had some back pain on and off for years, a slip and fall accident (Tom Thumb, Snider Plaza, Dallas!) in 2007 kinda took things to a new level. 

Quick Info:


I am a:



Singer/songwriter


Writer (as yet unpublished; this will change)


Occasional, small-time, medical advocate for self and others; (I once spurred Parkland Hospital, Dallas, to replace an aging operating table. But please know, this campaign is solely for my own benefit.)


Low-income, ""disabled,"" medical patient seeking funding for a corrective surgery.



I have:



A history degree


A mass Comm degree (recording industry management)


A goat who thinks she is my pet (she really belongs to someone else)


Lived in London, Los Angeles, NYC, Nashville, Houston, Dallas, and Austin. (There's more, but I'm sparing you.)



I would like to:



Alleviate near-constant pain and dysfunction

Reintegrate into a more productive life for both self and others 

And by doing so, eventually:


Record my second record and tour it *** 


Finish the book I've been working on (forever), 


Start a non-profit organization (and eventually move forward w/ funding) for all the ""Improve/Better Society"" ideas I have.


***I was blessed to be able to make a CD a few years back. I was planning on touring it in 09, but I tore the soft tissue in my elbows while ripping up carpet from a small closet, and basically, I couldn't do anything for two years, until after extensive physical therapy. (I'm 1/4 ""red-neck"" and 3/4 city.

Challenges:


I currently:



Live as a ""person of disability"" (since 1020; Borderline Personality Disorder and chronic pain challenges)


Try to participate in life everyday; but I do not work a job.


Live under the 2013 Federal Poverty guideline ($11,490 for a family of one).


I live in TX and need travel expenses paid because the experts whom I have found (through 6 months of research) are located in Gainesville, GA.



My medical condition:



Was previously misdiagnosed (solely as a lumbar spine problem) for quite some time.


Is only relieved temporarily by conservative treatments such as 


Physical therapy, Chiropractic, Pelvic/SI belt, etc.


Medication, both oral and topical


Injection therapy (both inter joint (fluoroscopically guided) and trigger point)

Campaign Specific:
While no one can guarantee the outcome of any surgery, I'm confident that with this surgery and after healing time, I will be restored to physical and mental functionality I've not enjoyed for years.
Successful funding of this campaign will allow me to:





Travel from Texas to Georgia where I will obtain the ""Sacroiliac Joint Fixation"" surgery.**


Travel back home from Georgia to Texas




Campaign funds will pay for expenses incurred in both the pre- and the post-operative period such as:

Ground transportation such as car rental and/or taxis

** There is a chance that I will have to undergo surgery of a more serious nature called Fusion (one of two types). If that happens, my post-operative recovery time will lengthen and I will be far more restricted. As such, I will have to rely on outside assistance for a longer period of time than is necessary for the other, less drastic, fixation surgery.

<p><strong>What I am doing, who I am, and what I am about:</strong></p>
<p>Greetings! My name is Shelagh Brown and I am an herbalist seeking to reconnect people with nature via plants, yoga, and other ancient healing modalities.</p>
<p><strong>I am ready to continue on my path of healing and self transformation  by completing a Yoga Teacher Certification Training through the only non-profit yoga studio in Seattle, the Samarya Center</strong> (<strong><a href=""http://samaryacenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://samaryacenter.org/</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Their visions of community based healing are very in line with my own, and I am incredibly grateful that they have offered me a partial scholarship to compete this training! If you are able to help me achieve my visions, you will have an herbalist and yogi in your corner for lifeand you are contributing to my mission in creating a more harmonious planet for all!</p>
<p>Yoga has completely transformed my life in the last 4 years. It has given me the ability to rise up against an array of trauma, injury and challenge. I want nothing more to be able to offer that same gift to others, while deepening my understanding of myself, humanity and the entire universe.</p>

Greetings! My name is Shelagh Brown and I am an herbalist seeking to reconnect people with nature via plants, yoga, and other ancient healing modalities.
I am ready to continue on my path of healing and self transformation  by completing a Yoga Teacher Certification Training through the only non-profit yoga studio in Seattle, the Samarya Center (http://samaryacenter.org/).
Their visions of community based healing are very in line with my own, and I am incredibly grateful that they have offered me a partial scholarship to compete this training! If you are able to help me achieve my visions, you will have an herbalist and yogi in your corner for lifeand you are contributing to my mission in creating a more harmonious planet for all!
Yoga has completely transformed my life in the last 4 years. It has given me the ability to rise up against an array of trauma, injury and challenge. I want nothing more to be able to offer that same gift to others, while deepening my understanding of myself, humanity and the entire universe.
Yoga is in part responsible for me to taking control of my own health, happiness, and well being, to love the body I have always struggled with and fought against, to be more flexible, patient, loving, and accepting, in mind , body and spirit.

<p>One day a soldier and a marine were sitting at a Starbucks planning what to do after their tours of service.  Both seemed sad to leave behind a lifestyle of teaching, fitness, and comraderie.  One had since gone into software development, while the other personal training.  Then the light went on!</p>
<p>""We could make an app that contains all the knowledge we have to help people get and STAY fit.  Not one of those 'Get Fit Quick' schemes but something that's real, like how we used to train.""</p>
<p>From this conceptual ""eureka!"" moment came the idea that would become the GTrain project.  Allow me to explain:</p>
<p>Everyone who has ever turned on a TV in the middle of the night has seen the endless barage of info-mercials claiming that in just 10 minutes a day you, too, can look like a fitness model.  Using the miraculous XYZ system used by some professional you may or may not have heard of etc etc etc...</p>
<p>The problem with every last one of these systems is this:  They work just fine for the first couple days, maybe weeks, and just maybe even months.  But in the end, none of them are designed to be sustainable lifestyles.  So the consumer sticks with it, loses the weight, and in 3 months has regained a large portion of the weight they had lost.  They feel like they failed.  Or, worse, the program wasn't right for them and they weren't able to see it through.  It's damaging to self image, confidence, and healthy living.</p>
<p>This is where we come in.  Our system is designed to be an adaptive, intelligent training tool that considers a user's abilities and plans workout routines that are right for each individual person.  Traditional routines are ""one size fits most"" and rely on the user's enthusiasm to power through.  While this can get people to accomplish great things, that enthusiasm is temporary.  What we need, really need, is something that can fit into and around even the most demanding schedule, adapt to users at various ages and fitness levels, and even compensate for locations like home, gym, track, and so on.  This is what GTrain is designed to do.</p>
<p>As of now we've already completed a prototype, and the app trully does everything it's claiming to.  But this is where we need help:  we don't have the resources to drop everything and go all in with this project (we have day jobs too!).  Luckily the fine folks at Indie Go Go have given us the answer:  you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The GTrain System</h2>
<p>The team at Gym Bodies conceived of a system that would intelligently plan workouts for users, adapting to their strengths and schedules, and making the most of their limited time.  This last month, Feb of 2012, we celebrated the completion of a fully functional prototype of the GTrain system.  That's right, we've proven it works.  Currently, however, the system won't be able to handle the user load of a full deployment to the market.</p>
<p>This is where the awesome community at Indie Go Go can help!  With your help we can build out the needed elements and servers to offer this to the public.  We've already created a buzz in Miami, Florida, where competition trainer Kevin Fain has lent his expertise and voice to helping make GTrain a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need and What You Get</h2>
<p>We need to raise a minumum of $14,000 to make this a reality.  That money will go towards:</p>
<p>- Server setup</p>
<p>- Rebuilding the Database and Portal to handle the user load</p>
<p>- Making it stylish and sleek</p>
<p>- Needed Changes to the core of the app revealed by testing</p>
<p>- Promotional materials to get the word out!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we can raise more, roughly another $6,000, we can do something really cool:</p>
<p>- Build iOS and Droid native versions of GTrain to further enhance usability!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In exchange for your support you get exclusive access to the Closed Beta of GTrain, premium membership for a minimum of 1 year from launch, and for coaches exclusive access to the Beta of Coach Connect before it's available to the public.  If you're really nice, we'll throw in all the good schwag you'd normally get for such help!</strong></p>

<p>It was said, laughably, ""Now sergeants are coming forward and talking about sexual assault that they witnessed from their fellow sergeants. This shows how good these men and women are.""</p>
<p>No. No it really doesn't. Because if they were truly so good--they would have reported it immediately, rather than waiting until those dirtbags got caught.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This unforgivable behavior does not belong in our military. We join the service for various reasons but we're all on the same team. Why should anyone feel like they have to watch out for their supposed 'comrades' over the enemy?</p>
<p>The tech school I am stationed at, DLI in Monterey California, has one of the highest sexual assault rates of any tech school in the military. It is a Joint-Service base--so all military branches attend. Since I arrived here in 2011, almost a dozen of my friends have been sexually assaulted by their fellow service members. And one was assaulted by an instructor. It's ridiculous. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Chain of Command wants to do the right thing and protect us but I think that it's probably difficult to get real stories from real people. The survivors tend not to trust the Commands because the victims are accused of lying, of exaggerating, that they should expect to be assaulted in the military--especially if they are female, or simply nothing is done with their case. It's sickening to me, the females I've met who were told that nothing would be done about the assault they suffered and they just need to let it go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let me tell you--I was abused for four years--you can't just 'let it go'. It's impossible. The effect it has on the psyche is catastrophic. It obliterates trust, makes you feel unsafe, makes you hate the very people you are SUPPOSED to be able to look up to for guidance and support. It ruins any sort of pride one has in the armed services of this nation. Comitting sexual assault and abuse is the most underhanded, cruel torture that someone can do to another person. Our laws are so ridiculously weak when it comes to dealing with rapists. Five to seven years in prison? Don't make me laugh; it's insulting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I want to do this project and try to find out why this problem is so prominent at DLI. I have a degree in History and research; so I have the academic tools but I need some additional equipment. I want to get a digital handheld recorder and I want to be able to conduct proper interviews and to compensate the victims for their time. I would also like to acquire the proper recording software for my computer.</p>
<p>If this project is successful, I am hoping to present it to the Commander of my unit. I want to help those who have been hurt and I think maybe if I could find some common factors and back it up, than they would have a better idea of what direction to go to help the survivors. I want to bring some transperency to the Commands as well. Call them out on their hypocrisy and disgusting tolerance of rape.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, that's what I want to do. Thank you so much for your time. Please spread this around if you can. </p>

<p>David McCann, a Plum Borough resident, found himself in a bad situation and another young man tried to take his life in a horrible act of violence. We are asking for your love, support and help for David and his family at this time. Dave has always been a very caring and loving person to his family and friends. He did not deserve to be shot and possibly the ability to walk again taken away from him. He is the loving father of three young sons, an uncle, a brother, a caring son and many other roles to people in his life. This incident happened days before his 30th birthday.</p>
<p>Now David needs your friendship and support so he can get through this difficult time and be there for everyone that needs him, especially his 3 young sons. His family needs our help too, so they can afford to make their home handicap accessible in order for Dave to come home. He still has hope, but his life may be changed forever.  If Dave remains paralyzed then he will need new transportation and other physical rehabilitation. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>ANYTHING you can donate WILL help! David is still in the hospital and his condition is still being determined. As of today, his diagnosis is paralysis from the waist down with a 10% chance of walking again. If you have spoken to him since the accident, you know that he is staying positive and is thankful to be alive. In order for David to come home, the McCann family needs to remodel a portion of their house with handicap access. He would be more comfortable being able to recover at home with his family and friends around. We hope to at least help them fund this effort. Before this happened, David could not afford health insurance with his job as a landscaper.  His medical costs are undetermined right now, but he already has several costly bills and many future expenses. No matter what amount you can donate it will greatly help him and his family with the related costs from this tragedy.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the goal, the funds will still go to the same place and help his family with medical bills and handicap remodeling and associated costs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will not only help Dave and his family with the costs they are incurring from this horrible situation, but it will ultimately show your love and support for his recovery.  He needs this positive impact right now. Becoming paralyzed at age 30 with three kids is a lot to swallow, but not the end! You can also help Dave turn his life into something positive for other young people facing similar issues.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you cannot give a monetary donation, there are many ways you can help and show support. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can visit Dave or send him a card or something to brighten his spirits.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you or someone you know have any remodeling or related experience, you could offer your services to his family.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you or someone you know is paralyzed, they could offer advice or friendship for Dave.</div>

<h3>Thank you for visiting this page!  Please help Dave and his family in this very serious time of need.</h3></div>","On September 5, 2012, David McCann was shot severely injuring him and changing his life forever.
David McCann, a Plum Borough resident, found himself in a bad situation and another young man tried to take his life in a horrible act of violence. We are asking for your love, support and help for David and his family at this time. Dave has always been a very caring and loving person to his family and friends. He did not deserve to be shot and possibly the ability to walk again taken away from him. He is the loving father of three young sons, an uncle, a brother, a caring son and many other roles to people in his life. This incident happened days before his 30th birthday.
Now David needs your friendship and support so he can get through this difficult time and be there for everyone that needs him, especially his 3 young sons. His family needs our help too, so they can afford to make their home handicap accessible in order for Dave to come home. He still has hope, but his life may be changed forever.  If Dave remains paralyzed then he will need new transportation and other physical rehabilitation. 
What We Need & What You Get

ANYTHING you can donate WILL help! David is still in the hospital and his condition is still being determined. As of today, his diagnosis is paralysis from the waist down with a 10% chance of walking again. If you have spoken to him since the accident, you know that he is staying positive and is thankful to be alive. In order for David to come home, the McCann family needs to remodel a portion of their house with handicap access. He would be more comfortable being able to recover at home with his family and friends around. We hope to at least help them fund this effort. Before this happened, David could not afford health insurance with his job as a landscaper.  His medical costs are undetermined right now, but he already has several costly bills and many future expenses. No matter what amount you can donate it will greatly help him and his family with the related costs from this tragedy.
If we do not reach the goal, the funds will still go to the same place and help his family with medical bills and handicap remodeling and associated costs.


The Impact
Your donation will not only help Dave and his family with the costs they are incurring from this horrible situation, but it will ultimately show your love and support for his recovery.  He needs this positive impact right now. Becoming paralyzed at age 30 with three kids is a lot to swallow, but not the end! You can also help Dave turn his life into something positive for other young people facing similar issues.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot give a monetary donation, there are many ways you can help and show support. 
 
You can visit Dave or send him a card or something to brighten his spirits.
 
If you or someone you know have any remodeling or related experience, you could offer your services to his family.
 
If you or someone you know is paralyzed, they could offer advice or friendship for Dave.
 
Thank you for visiting this page!  Please help Dave and his family in this very serious time of need.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Adam Greene and I am a part time photojournalist. In March of this year I went to Israel and the Palestinian Territories to photograph and interview Israelis and Palestinians for a project I am working on a project Voices For Peace <a href=""www.ipvfp.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ipvfp.wordpress.com</a>. During this trip I made contact with a Palestinian family I met 30 years ago. Upon meeting the family I learnt about the situation 21 year old Nidawr is facing. As a child she seriously injured her left eye which is now causing her a good deal of pain and has now lost her sight. Since taking taking the above photograph of her there is considerable inflamation around the eye and she has to wear an eye patch. She has become quite depressed about her appearance. The sum of money needed for the operations is not huge ($2000) but will dramatically change Nidawrs appearnce and alleviate the daily pain she currently experiences.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What Nidawr Needs</h3>
<p>I am out to raise $2000 which will cover the cost of the 2 operations needed. The cost of surgery is approximately $1700 and the remainder is for the cost of transport and permits. The first operation is scheduled for september 10th 2015 at the St John Eye Hospital in East Jerusalem with the following operation to be undertaken 2 weeks later. Nidawr's father Adnan is unemployed and has an approximate income of $400 a month. Nidawrs current medication costs are about $200 a month so there has been a huge finacial strain for the family. I will be raising funds from other sources so I am confident about raising the total amount needed. Any extra funds raised will be used to pay back money that has been loaned to the family</p>
<br/>
</div><b>Why this is Important<br/><br/></b>Primarily this is an appeal on a straightforward humanitarian level. But this does go deeper. This is about breaking through the barriers that exist between Jews and Muslims (as I myself am of Jewish heritage) and as part of my project between Israelis and Palestinians who are opposing violence and extremism and looking for ways forward of living and relating to eachother where politicians are failing. <br/>Find me on Facebook. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/adam.greene.7359"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adam Greene on Facebook </a><br/></div>","Campaign Introduction

After a leg break in July, 2010 a week before his first scheduled transplant, the transplant was postponed until September 2010. At his 100 day checkup, we were told it was not as successful as they would like and preparations began for a tandem transplant for February 2011. After developing H1N1 and then shingles, he was finally able to receive a second transplant on May 22, 2011.

He donated his cells again for this transplant and Day Zero, our his Rebirthday as many call this, was October 20, 2014. </p>
<p>On October 24th, he began to have complications from the transplant and has been in the hospital fighting an unexplained high fever and blood pressure issues.

Due to my extended leave time, I will not be receiving any income in December and possibly January, if I am not cleared to go back to work.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello. We are requesting financial assistance for my husband and myself,  as he recovers from his third bone marrow transplant.
Phillip is 64 years old and was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma in the spring of 2010.  He began chemotherapy immediately, in order to prepare for a transplant in the fall. After a leg break in July, 2010 a week before his first scheduled transplant, the transplant was postponed until September 2010. At his 100 day checkup, we were told it was not as successful as they would like and preparations began for a tandem transplant for February 2011. After developing H1N1 and then shingles, he was finally able to receive a second transplant on May 22, 2011. He was only able to reach partial remission at 96%.  Phillip was able to donate his own cells for both of these transplants, as well as some for a future autologous stem cell transplant, if needed.
After receiving three and one-half years of maintenance chemotherapy, twice a week, his panels indicated that the current chemotherapy was no longer working and that he would need a third transplant, much earlier than the anticipated 7 to 10 year window first predicted.  After switching to two different forms of chemotherapy, he was prepped for his third transplant this past summer. He donated his cells again for this transplant and Day Zero, our his Rebirthday as many call this, was October 20, 2014. 
On October 24th, he began to have complications from the transplant and has been in the hospital fighting an unexplained high fever and blood pressure issues. After a scary day of possibly being admitted to the ICU, he was stabilized and is doing better overall. We anticipate being able to return home on Monday or Tuesday of this week, after he is fever free and provided no other infections set in.
We are requesting financial assistance to support us while I am off work for 4 to 6 weeks, as a teacher's assistant in our local school district for a preschool/Head Start program. Phillip is medically retired from the Navy and receives pay from the US Navy and from Social Security.  As of this point, we no longer have any savings and know what our immediate expenses will be for each month.  The only variables will be medications that change, sometimes daily, transportation costs of a 50 mile roundtrip visit daily from our home for at least 4 weeks, and any further hospital stays and costs associated with personal expenses while hospitalized.

I nearly committed suicide right before I turned 21,(the irony is not lost on me here)...I spent years of late night drinking, drugging, unhealthy relationships, poor choices, poor diet, etc. Really did not have a compass to navigate the dangers of being young in the culture on the East End of Long Island.  Mid March of 2010 I went way too far, drank way too much, vengefully, challenging death...I woke up having little recollection of the event.  But I was extremely sick and had a feeling that something had shifted. I don't know whether it was grace or God or luck or a high tolerance...but I survived and that day forward I sought to create a positive life that would benefit others. </p><p>I went on a healing journey of epic proportions: backpacking through Europe, crossing the continent in a Greyhound to work on farms in Santa Barbara and Oregon, music festivals, fairs, new people, new places, new culture, a new life.</p><p>  I came to see the consumption commerical charade that plagues my hometown and much of urbanized technocratic societies was not the only way to live. I saw how these choices we make continue to exacerbate the craving and aversion duality that destroys our bodymindspirits...</p><p>Yoga came naturally, as a way to deepen the inner peace I had found with a new chapter to my life.  I found the benefits were amazing.  Increased focus, greater comfort in my body, vitality/strength, better decision making, less struggle and more flow...more living, less fighting.</p><p> In 2012 I read Autobiography of a Yogi, and soon was inspired to study and learn in depth. </p><p> Here's an article by a Hatha Yoga master, Joel Kramer. He speaks of the process of transformation that occurs, which accurately reflects my own experience for sure.  </p><p><a href=""http://www.joeldiana.com/downloads/writings/YogaAsSelfTransformation.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.joeldiana.com/downloads/writings/YogaAsSelfTransformation.pdf</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p> </p><p><br/></p><p><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Commonly Asked Questions</span><br/></b></p><p>

<p><b>What is Dharma Yoga? </b></p>
<p>Dharma Yoga refers to the yogic science as taught by Dharma
Mittra. Dharma has created multiple series of postures (asanas) specific to his
own perspective and style. This yoga teacher training course is under his
supervision, at his school in New York City. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Wait, who is Dharma Mittra?</b></p>

<p><b>What is energy healing and Light of the Eternal One? </b></p>
<p> Ever heard the adage,
“Energy flows where attention goes?” Well this is a basic starting point to
getting energy healing, and well, creating anything. It all begins with a
thought.  Energy healing is, for me, an
attraction of certain frequencies of energy that vibrate at very high, harmonic
levels. Take Dr. Emoto’s water experiments, as an excellent example of how
thought can affect matter.  Light of the
Eternal One is a specific energy of tremendous joy and harmony; it brings
elements of life into wholeness and love. When I do sessions on myself (which I
do daily), I soon feel a blissful state melt away any crap
that I was carrying.  In a longer session,
I get the benefits of an outstanding meditation, which transforms my
whole being. I am patient and at peace, happy and strong within my mind and that’s
worth a lot to me. That’s one of the reasons why I am excited to offer the chance
to experience the energy to others. </p><p>Here is the website for Brett, who teaches this wonderful energy healing modality: </p><p><a href=""http://brettbevell.com/wordpress/books-2/energy-healing-for-everyone/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://brettbevell.com/wordpress/books-2/energy-healing-for-everyone/</a><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1146219/files/20150112185354-energy_healing_for_everyone_a_path_to_whoelness_and_awakening.jpg?1421117634"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>What is “Edu-tainment” and why would I want to participate?
Is it really worth it? </b></p>
<p>Edu-tainment is a way to label workshop, with an obvious
emphasis on play, or entertainment. If you are familiar with the Waldorf school
and their philosophy around learning, it’s a similar basic idea: we learn
better by doing what interests us, by playing. By following our passion, our
curiosity. </p>
<p>Edu-tainment “workshops” will be a never-before-seen fusion
of dance, yoga, meditation, raw foods and superfoods, energy healing, improv
acting, singing, talks and discussions with stellar teachers of the vibrant
living/edu-tainment paradigm (myself included)…How much fun can we have doing
what truly nourishes us and inspires us on a deep level? How much potent
knowledge can we share, information that empowers us to take greater joy in
taking responsibility for our health, our passions, our shadows and our
destiny?  </p>
<p>So far, these locations are tentative destinations for the
Edu-tainment offering: </p>
<p>East End of Long Island, NY</p>
<p>NYC</p>
<p>Asheville, NC</p>
<p>Sedona, AZ</p>
<p>Bay Area, CA </p>
<p>Beloved Sacred Art and Music Festival (Tidewater Falls, OR) </p>
<p><b>What is Holistic Health Mastery and “an assessment”? </b></p>
<p>Holistic Health Mastery is a brand-spankin’ new integrated
nutrition program, primarily created by Ronnie Landis.  The program introduction
reads : “…the goal of this course is to empower you to be the best version of
yourself ever!” I HIGHLY recommend giving the website a look. He’s posted an
outline of the curriculum and it is EXTENSIVE, from superfoods to detox to
hormonal health to sungazing, Ronnie’s complied over a dedicated athletic
career and successful health coaching business, a powerful knowledge base.  </p>
<p>The assessment is my way of building a greater understanding
with you of your body, mind, and spirit. It creates a baseline so we can see Where
you are at.</p>
<p> As Lao-Tzu supposedly
said, “If you do not change your direction, you may end up where you are
heading.” </p>
<p>That’s why the assessment is crucial. AND you do it with me,
so I include various techniques I’ve learned throughout my journey with

See what inspires you and know that you have inspired me just by reading this post and visiting my campaign.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, for taking your time to participate.   In JOY, Shen   the story ~A bit on how I got here. I have enjoyed the benefits of a consistent study and practice of Yoga by many teachers, many styles.  The philosophy and the effects of a dedicated practice have transformed my life. I nearly committed suicide right before I turned 21,(the irony is not lost on me here)...I spent years of late night drinking, drugging, unhealthy relationships, poor choices, poor diet, etc. Really did not have a compass to navigate the dangers of being young in the culture on the East End of Long Island.  Mid March of 2010 I went way too far, drank way too much, vengefully, challenging death...I woke up having little recollection of the event.  But I was extremely sick and had a feeling that something had shifted. I don't know whether it was grace or God or luck or a high tolerance...but I survived and that day forward I sought to create a positive life that would benefit others. I went on a healing journey of epic proportions: backpacking through Europe, crossing the continent in a Greyhound to work on farms in Santa Barbara and Oregon, music festivals, fairs, new people, new places, new culture, a new life.  I came to see the consumption commerical charade that plagues my hometown and much of urbanized technocratic societies was not the only way to live. I saw how these choices we make continue to exacerbate the craving and aversion duality that destroys our bodymindspirits...Yoga came naturally, as a way to deepen the inner peace I had found with a new chapter to my life.  I found the benefits were amazing.  Increased focus, greater comfort in my body, vitality/strength, better decision making, less struggle and more flow...more living, less fighting. In 2012 I read Autobiography of a Yogi, and soon was inspired to study and learn in depth.  Here's an article by a Hatha Yoga master, Joel Kramer. He speaks of the process of transformation that occurs, which accurately reflects my own experience for sure.  http://www.joeldiana.com/downloads/writings/YogaAsSelfTransformation.pdf Commonly Asked Questions
(READ THIS ONE) How can I get my Rewards,( yoga, energy
healing, etc.,) if we are not in the same place? 
Due to the awesome power of collective action through
micro-finance, many people can donate from exotic destinations. Thus internet,
cellphone means of connecting to me is required for you to receive your reward.  It is not uncommon to do long distance
healings, nutritional guidance, and yes! Even yoga asana.
 Check the answer to
the “What is Edutainment…” to read more about where I plan on visiting
geographically this year. 
What is Dharma Yoga? 
Dharma Yoga refers to the yogic science as taught by Dharma
Mittra. Dharma has created multiple series of postures (asanas) specific to his
own perspective and style. This yoga teacher training course is under his
supervision, at his school in New York City. 
Wait, who is Dharma Mittra?
Dharma Mittra is a 75-years-young Brazilian yogi master, who
in his early twenties began learning and teaching various forms of yoga in
NYC.  He continues to do so to this
day.  He's a gem of a human being as well :-)  Why are you asking for six thousand dollars?   The pricing goes as follows:     3,995.00 for the full tuition  500.00 for the 14 days prior to the start date of the training 220.00 books, materials and app fee 1000.00+  transportation, food, rent for two weeks in Manhattan (welcome to New York City) 
What is energy healing and Light of the Eternal One? 
 Ever heard the adage,
“Energy flows where attention goes?” Well this is a basic starting point to
getting energy healing, and well, creating anything. It all begins with a
thought.  Energy healing is, for me, an
attraction of certain frequencies of energy that vibrate at very high, harmonic
levels. Take Dr. Emoto’s water experiments, as an excellent example of how
thought can affect matter.  Light of the
Eternal One is a specific energy of tremendous joy and harmony; it brings
elements of life into wholeness and love. When I do sessions on myself (which I
do daily), I soon feel a blissful state melt away any crap
that I was carrying.  In a longer session,
I get the benefits of an outstanding meditation, which transforms my
whole being. I am patient and at peace, happy and strong within my mind and that’s
worth a lot to me. That’s one of the reasons why I am excited to offer the chance
to experience the energy to others. Here is the website for Brett, who teaches this wonderful energy healing modality: http://brettbevell.com/wordpress/books-2/energy-healing-for-everyone/
What is “Edu-tainment” and why would I want to participate?
Is it really worth it? 
Edu-tainment is a way to label workshop, with an obvious
emphasis on play, or entertainment. If you are familiar with the Waldorf school
and their philosophy around learning, it’s a similar basic idea: we learn
better by doing what interests us, by playing. By following our passion, our
curiosity. 
Edu-tainment “workshops” will be a never-before-seen fusion
of dance, yoga, meditation, raw foods and superfoods, energy healing, improv
acting, singing, talks and discussions with stellar teachers of the vibrant
living/edu-tainment paradigm (myself included)…How much fun can we have doing
what truly nourishes us and inspires us on a deep level? How much potent
knowledge can we share, information that empowers us to take greater joy in
taking responsibility for our health, our passions, our shadows and our
destiny?  
So far, these locations are tentative destinations for the
Edu-tainment offering: 
East End of Long Island, NY
NYC
Asheville, NC
Sedona, AZ
Bay Area, CA 
Beloved Sacred Art and Music Festival (Tidewater Falls, OR) 
What is Holistic Health Mastery and “an assessment”? 
Holistic Health Mastery is a brand-spankin’ new integrated
nutrition program, primarily created by Ronnie Landis.  The program introduction
reads : “…the goal of this course is to empower you to be the best version of
yourself ever!” I HIGHLY recommend giving the website a look. He’s posted an
outline of the curriculum and it is EXTENSIVE, from superfoods to detox to
hormonal health to sungazing, Ronnie’s complied over a dedicated athletic
career and successful health coaching business, a powerful knowledge base.  
The assessment is my way of building a greater understanding
with you of your body, mind, and spirit. It creates a baseline so we can see Where
you are at.
 As Lao-Tzu supposedly
said, “If you do not change your direction, you may end up where you are
heading.” 
That’s why the assessment is crucial. AND you do it with me,
so I include various techniques I’ve learned throughout my journey with
Traditional Chinese Medicine, intuitive energy work and cutting edge science.

 What's the deal with the Music and Poetry lesson?  Music and poetry have, since I can remember at like 5 years of age, passions.  Now I have dedicated an immense amount of focus to cultivating these arts into real skills.  It is a Journey every day, just to sing and play my own music.   the Music and Poetry lesson will empower you to explore your voice, your body, your writing, your story, and most importantly, it will be fun.  Vocal exercises, playing with questions like where does music come from, what is poetry, how can you really express what you feel, what you want to communicate, etc.  I have been told by more than a few friends that I hold safe, effective space for this type of learning.  It gives me tremendous satisfaction to warm up the pen and the vocal chords and be witness (and conductor) to someone else's songs.  We have a Bard in all of us!

<p>And I went into this kind of business myself by 2001. I introduced the use of probiotic to farmers in Java Island, Indonesia, to substitute their usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticide.</p>
<p><b>Chemical Over-usage in Indonesian Agriculture</b></p>
<p>Yet I was surprised with the over-usage of toxic ingredients in their crop process. Not only they will harm the environments with this overdose chemical usage, but also poisoning the consumers of those products.</p>
<p>In 2008 I found that organic farmers are growing, as the result of crop failure and other effect caused by pesticide and chemical fertilizers overuse. The farmers are strive to get a better crop with more traditional ways, and practicing organic farming methods.</p>
<p><b>More Organic and More Natural Products Start to Grow</b></p>
<p>In the same time, my friends and I also found that there were several enterprises whose products are in organic, green and healthy procedure. Most of the producers are micro in size and experiences. Their condition of chemical substance sensitivity trigger their deeds. They become the producers of many Organic, Green and Healthy products first for themselves, for their family, and then for their society as well.</p>
<p>Now they are growing, as the effects of the chemical misuse over range of products, food and non-food are also accelerating. But yet, they have difficulties to sell those products, as the lack of communication to market. These farmers and enterprises usually can only produce a little</p>
<p><b>So Many People Need, So Little The Information</b></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many people in Indonesia, and also over Countries, who need those kind of products. Especially for those who are suffers from chemical sensitivities.</p>
<p>These people are in needs, but they don't know where to buy. They don't have sufficient information regarding Organic, Green and Healthy products and services.</p>
<p><b>Education, Institution and Marketplace</b></p>
<p>To connect these two parties: Those who produce and Those who in needs, we need to have some place where these two could meet and get to know each other well. That's why this passage need to have an issue of:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Educational</b>, not only for Consumers but also for Producers for their quality</li>
<li>
<b>Institution</b> to help Farmers and Producers to produce more organic, more nature, and get better result within their products and services, e.g: the best package material and design.</li>

</div></div>","Marketplace for small organic Farmers My name is Christopher Emille Jayanata, I started to getting close with agriculture since my childhood, as my parents are coming from agronomy educational background.
And I went into this kind of business myself by 2001. I introduced the use of probiotic to farmers in Java Island, Indonesia, to substitute their usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticide.
Chemical Over-usage in Indonesian Agriculture
Yet I was surprised with the over-usage of toxic ingredients in their crop process. Not only they will harm the environments with this overdose chemical usage, but also poisoning the consumers of those products.
In 2008 I found that organic farmers are growing, as the result of crop failure and other effect caused by pesticide and chemical fertilizers overuse. The farmers are strive to get a better crop with more traditional ways, and practicing organic farming methods.
More Organic and More Natural Products Start to Grow
In the same time, my friends and I also found that there were several enterprises whose products are in organic, green and healthy procedure. Most of the producers are micro in size and experiences. Their condition of chemical substance sensitivity trigger their deeds. They become the producers of many Organic, Green and Healthy products first for themselves, for their family, and then for their society as well.
Now they are growing, as the effects of the chemical misuse over range of products, food and non-food are also accelerating. But yet, they have difficulties to sell those products, as the lack of communication to market. These farmers and enterprises usually can only produce a little
So Many People Need, So Little The Information
On the other hand, there are many people in Indonesia, and also over Countries, who need those kind of products. Especially for those who are suffers from chemical sensitivities.
These people are in needs, but they don't know where to buy. They don't have sufficient information regarding Organic, Green and Healthy products and services.
Education, Institution and Marketplace
To connect these two parties: Those who produce and Those who in needs, we need to have some place where these two could meet and get to know each other well. That's why this passage need to have an issue of:



Educational, not only for Consumers but also for Producers for their quality

Institution to help Farmers and Producers to produce more organic, more nature, and get better result within their products and services, e.g: the best package material and design.

Marketplace for these qualified farmers and producers, where the consumers can rely on.

   One Place to Start With I have manage to gather friends from variety backgrounds and disciplines in a community named: Komunitas Organik Indonesia (KOI) or Indonesia Organic Community. www.KomunitasOrganikIndonesia.org
What is organic not the products, neither the certificate, but the mind and heart of the people. The people who produce and the people who consume them.
The funding that our community needs is about Rp. 10 Billion, or equivalent to US$ 1 Million to get start with our place for Educational, Institution and Marketplace, or what we call the Gerai Hijau (Gerai: Place to meet, display and trade. Hijau: Green. So it Gerai Hijau means Green / EcoFriendly Place for Meet).
Our community also has already established a legal entity, and we chose Cooperative (Koperasi) for this matter. So we are in legal institution, as we have a commitment to achieve our dream.
This Cooperative named Koperasi Produk Sehat Indonesia (Cooperative of Indonesian Healthy Products) abbrev KOPSI which will manage the fund that we will collect, to built the Gerai Hijau.


Gerai Hijau
In this Gerai Hijau, the farmers and producers of Organic, Green & Healthy Products can meet their consumers. Gerai Hijau will be the place for:



Workshop of Organic, Green & Healthy movement

Mini Seminar and Scheduled Talkshow

Entrepreneurship Training Center for Producers and Producers to be

Consultation Class for Organic, Green and Healthy issues

Marketplace for Farmers, Group of Farmers, Artisans, Local Producers, from all over Indonesia.

The goal for the fund is to getting start to built this ideal shape of Gerai Hijau and placed in ideal location in Jakarta area.
If we can't reach the entire goal, the form of Gerai Hijau and the location will be altered to lower level, which can be cheaper and easier to get.

Green Impact
 With this Gerai Hijau, the community will be able to promote and show to the people of Indonesia and also to the world that there are so many varieties of products, very wide range, and coming from numerous farmers and producers.
When the marketplace run well, so the farmers will grow the organic more, and the producers will produce more. And by that time, the environment will getting better and better. 
This green cycle will happen and Indonesia with a huge land of agriculture will donate more fresh oxygen to the world atmosphere. Start with our tiny movement here.
Our community has already succeeded to manage 3 times Expos of Organic, Green and Healthy, from 2011 to 2013, which gathered of about 120 Farmers, Group of Farmers, Small-Medium Enterprise from all over Indonesia.

The name of the Expo is as it is: Organic, Green & Healthy Expo of Indonesia. www.oghexpo.com
OGH Expo I, 2011

OGH Expo II, 2012

OGH Expo III, 2013


Now there are about 120 registered SME members and more than 8.000 individual members of the Community


  Risks & Challenges What the Community will face in this projects is about the place for Gerai Hijau to be located. As people in Indonesia still are looking for the more strategic location to come. While the strategic means price.
These are our steps to overcome these challenges:


Find the best location coming from our networks, to get the best ventures out of it. It can be a donation, a contribution, or the least is to rent with a low price.
Get the lowest price yet the best design, which coming from the community network as well, for the exterior and interior design.
Start to hire qualified members who will work with their heart, not their pocket, to assure this project to come to success. The committees from our previous Expos can be the first clue and good referrals.
Start filtering our producers members who track record are flawless so customers can rely on.
Monitoring and evaluating every steps and achievements to this project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dad was an only child. During WWII, he had an easy-out as far as the draft. He was also 16 years old. Out of a sense of patriotic duty, He talked his Mother, my Grandmother, into signing the papers so he could enlist in the Army Air Force. He served proudly, and was discharged honorably. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our Father has now reached the age of 87. He has Parkinson's disease and other ailments which will take him from us some time this year.</p>
<p>Caring for him in the home has been very draining on our finances and resources, and on us emotionally and socially.</p>
<p>Our Father worked hard his entire life. He did a decent job of raising five kids.  He married and stayed married to our Mother (Who passed away 7 years ago) for 51 years. He was active in our Boy Scouts troops, helped coach softball. And made really awful  puns.</p>
<p>Now he is bed ridden. It is harder and harder to get him up to use the comode next to his bed. His memory fails, but at times he can remember clearly things that happened 60 years ago, but not what he had for breakfast.</p>
<p>He needs 24/7 attention and care more and more as he slides into home base.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While medicare helps with quite a bit, and we have a Hospice helping us, there is still a huge financial, and emotional strain.</p>

<p>Myself and a sibling have been the care providers for Dad for the last few years. This has been very draining on us. While I am thankful for every day that I get to spend with Dad, I am also burned out and broke.</p>
<p>It is time for us to hire home health care assistants. Medicare does not cover this expense. And it IS an expense!</p>
<p>Dad's appetite fades away. But he loves his Ensure nutrition drink. He goes through several bottles a day, and that stuff is really expensive. But it is about all he will intake on some days. Chewing and getting food into his mouth is becoming a big issue.</p>
<p>I have a job that I have had to cut way back on so I can stay home and care for Dad. And now it looks like I will have to pay out more then I earn in order to hire some help.</p>

<p>We don't know how long Dad will last. I am sure it will be within this year that he passes. His desire is to stay here at home until the end.</p>
<p><em>more detail:</em></p>
<p>We have Hospice workers that come in a couple of times a week to take care of some hygienic tasks and to monitor his health. While these people are wonderful, and covered by his insurance, getting any other outside help is very expensive.</p>
<p>There are several programs we could use, but the co-pay on our part would be from $750 per month to $2,500 a month or more. Those programs would cover in-home assistants. (Basically baby sitters that are able to change adult diapers and do other work)</p>
<p>And there is also the option of us hiring ""baby sitters"" on our own, probably cheaper. But it is risky hiring strangers, even by referal. And trained, bonded, insured help is much much better.</p>

I would love to be able to go play with my band, which has been sitting idle because of my duties at home.  I would like to go out dating and meeting people. I just need a break. I also need to fix my old junker of a car.</p>
<p>I know that many of you will be in this position in the future, or have been in this position already. </p>
<p>I put $10,000 as a goal for this fund raiser, but really any amount will help. I am sure that when it is all totaled up, we will still come out in the hole.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being able to make Dad's last days as comfortable as possible would be a blessing. Letting Dad live these last weeks with dignity, and in his own home is his desire.</p>
<p>For us, his care-givers, to not have to worry, biting our fingernails and stressing out over bills and logistics and the every day chores of caring for an elderly parent would be a huge relief. And that is a relief that is passed on to dad as well.</p>
<p>We try so very hard to hide our frustrations and stress and depression from him. We do not want him to feel like a burden, or feel guilty. But he senses it, and it affects him.</p>
<p>This is an issue that almost all of us will face at some point in our lives. If you have been through it, then you know what a draining ordeal it can be. And you will appreciate what our struggle is.</p>
<p>If by some miracle there is money left over after Dad passes, we will use it to cover any other  debts or bills, and then donate the remainder to either the Hospice, or the Public library, which dad was a big supporter of. (Or possibly the Air Combat Museum which he also supported)</p>
<p>You will have our undying gratitude, and many thanks. I am a strong believer in ""What comes around, goes around"", and that it all comes back to you.</p>

<p>For little Bryr Walker, a 10-year-old motocross racer from the small country town of Emmett, Idaho, the grand dream of racing for the National Championship Title at Loretta Lynn's Ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee seems just a tad bit out of reach.  With 9 State and Local Championship Titles, over 100 Wins, and a few broken bones, the struggle to reach Bryr's dream isn’t due to a lack of talent, determination, and motivation.  Rather, the struggle to reach greatness at the National Championships due to a lack of adequate funding is simply daunting!</p>

<p>Bryr certainly does have the skill and heart to go for the National Win, but he comes from a huge family in a tiny town.  One parent struggles to pay the bills, and the other is studying to become a nurse.  All of this adds up to the great need to seek support from good-hearted people who believe in the golden dreams of an innocent, young boy just starting to make his way in the big world.</p>

<p>The cost of motorcycles, maintenance and rebuilds, food, fuel costs, insurance, doctor bills that weren't covered by insurance, entry fees, uniforms, and many more necessary things is far too great for his family.  Asking Dad to take cash out of the meager family living funds and put it into motocross ... well, a child can’t achieve this on his own.</p>

<h1><b>Hello Beautiful Friends!</b></h1>
<p>I recently (<i>as of 4 hours ago on

wonderful news. I have been accepted into the amazing Kripalu Center for Yoga

in 5 days and the basic costs, including training, materials, and
transportation work out to over $4300!<br/></p>
<p>Kripalu is a place near and
dear to my heart, as it is in a way the foundation to my yoga journey. I come
from a spiritual family and have always been drawn to practices that integrate
the body, mind, and soul, but I did not begin practicing yoga regularly until
high school. I attended Monument Mountain Regional High School and was
fortunate to be part of a Kripalu Yoga collaboration in which we were able to
practice yoga instead of gym class. To this day, almost 8 years later, I still
have the course materials and practice the
flows and breathing exercises we learned regularly. My yoga practice has progressed immensely, and I can now do amazing asanas like this - </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/739601/files/20140723192031-Dancer.jpg?1406168431"" src="""" style=""""/></p>and this - <p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/739604/files/20140723192111-Baby_crow.jpg?1406168471"" src="""" style=""""/></p>!!!!!
<p>I want my yoga practice and
students in the future to be filled with love and self-awareness, and I believe
that I can achieve this as a Kripalu Yoga Teacher. This training is about much
more than the certification for me. I am so excited to see how this experience
will shape the rest of my life and shape me as a being, and I hope to carry
everything I learn deep within my body and share it with the world (YOU!). I hope to
be able to bring everyone around me, especially those that may not normally be
exposed to it, a piece of my joy and experience. I know for a fact that this
practice can brighten lives and elucidate thoughts, ideas, and futures, and I
truly believe the skills I learn will allow me to bring others to this
realization. </p>
<p>In the past five years, I have managed to
circumnavigate the world, get myself through a degree in biology with a
concentration in health care, 3 study abroad programs, 4 internships, full time
employment, and 19 countries. I am ready for the next step in this crazy
adventure that is my life, I only need a little help to get there. </p>

<h2><b>What I need &amp; What I can offer

<p>So here is the deal! I am attending
this program no matter what. If I don’t manage to do it starting on Sunday, my
acceptance is valid for one year and the next program is October
19–November 14, 2014. It is an investment in my life and
hopefully will be in yours too! As I mentioned before, the full cost of the
program works out to over $4300 – here is a little break down:</p>
<p>Tuition - $2,675</p>
<p>Commuter Fee (covers 3 meals a
day and facility use- $55/day for 26 days)-
$1430</p>
<p>Transportation, Books, and Equipment- $300 -
$400</p>
<p>Total: $4,405 - $4,505 </p>
<p>I will be staying at my wonderful momma’s house
to offset the cost of accommodation. If I raise anything above the campaign
goal, the money will go towards funding community yoga classes once my training
is completed.</p>

<h2><b>So <i>what</i> will I get out of all
of this?</b></h2>
<p>I was born with the
overwhelming need to share my emotions, energy, ideas, and learning with the
world. I want to help others create an experience that will lead them to a more
empowering life. I have already started researching how to go about teaching community classes and
this is another step in the process of becoming a health and wellness advisor. My
body and mind require activity, stimulation, and I can’t think of a better way
to nourish my body than practicing and teaching yoga, wellness, and nutrition
to others that may need the same sort of release and realization. I want to

<p>The device is a glove that contains advanced sensors to electronically ‘feel’ for tumors during a routine breast exam. In addition to the clinician’s judgment, we hope the glove can generate data on suspicious lesions that require follow up.</p>
<p>We know getting a new cancer diagnostic tool is approved is going to be tough, so we're going to tackle these two problems first:</p>
<p><br/> 1) Global Health/ Telemedicine: in many places there is no healthcare available.  We believe minimally skilled workers can perform these exams and then email the data to experts for analysis.</p>
<p>2) A Training Tool for Medical Students: this device produces empirical data that can visualize different types of tumors during a CBE, thus improving training.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the money go?</strong><br/> Your funds will go directly to paying for parts. Unlike other funding sources, no funds will go towards labor or overhead. </p>
<ul>
<li>ARFI ultrasound elements and electronics: $2k</li>
<li>Data acquisition device - $1.5k</li>
<li>Sensor board - $1k</li>
<li>Breast cancer phantom: $1k</li>
<li>Inertial measurement unit - $500</li>
<li>Glove and other sensor parts - $500</li>
<li>Soldering equipment and misc parts - $500</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why are you on IndieGoGo and not applying to Komen or NIH?</strong><br/> These types of grants are typically set aside for projects already showing promise or data.  IndieGoGo will help us generate pilot data, which we can use for these grants.</p>
<p><strong>Potential discoveries:</strong><br/> Our goal is to create a glove that complements the clinical breast exam (CBE).  This device will record its own unique data as well as data from the clinician’s fingertip to provide an objective record of the exam.  This study will allow us to generate pilot data to apply for larger grants from institutes like the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<ol>
<li>We will fabricate prototype of CBE augmentation glove which generates force and ultrasound data (3 finger tips) as well as joint angle (all finger joints).  This in turn, will be used to generate: 1) Tissue compliance data and 2) Normalized Δt signals from ARFI ultrasound.  Data will be calibrated against known samples.</li>
<li>We will use the compliance and ARFI normalized Δt signals to generate 2-axis time series test data to discriminate between control and ""diseased"" breast phantoms during mock CBE.</li>
<li>We will use an artificial neural network to generate ""tissue score"" to discriminate breast tissue properties.  A continuum of tissue score and confidence level versus disease phantom properties will be presented and assessment made for the inexpensive non-radiological imaging of breast tissue, telemedicine and training tool potential for conducting CBEs.</li>
</ol><p><strong>Who are you guys?</strong><br/> A roboticist with a PhD in biomedical engineering from USC, an ultrasound scientist from USC and a breast cancer physician.</p>

<p><img alt=""Mockup of the data glove"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jaymung.com/comments/glovePic.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Mockup of the data glove""/></p>
<p>We’ve included more detailed information below:</p>
<p><strong>Statement of the Problem:</strong><br/> The device allows the standardization of Clinical Breast Exams (CBEs) through generation of objective tactile and ultrasound data.  Malignant masses generally are hard, immobile, and fixed to surrounding skin and soft tissue, with poorly defined or irregular margins.  Benign masses generally cause no skin change and are smooth, soft to firm, and mobile, with well-defined margins (Barton,<em>et al</em>., 1999).  These features can be discriminated by sensing modalities that detect difference in tissue stiffness: e.g. force sensors and ultrasound.  This represents an advance in increased screening and gathering of objective data for populations that are transient amongst clinicians such as military personnel.   <br/> Mammographic screening is also predicated on comparative analysis between mammograms.  This technology allows those same comparisons to occur. <br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed:</strong><br/> We present a case for a Clinical Breast Exam Augmentation Glove: a device worn over a clinician’s hand that records finger position, joint angle, force and ultrasound measurements during a CBE to provide empirical data from CBE to CBE for patients.  This device represents possibilities in inexpensive non-radiological imaging of breast tissue, telemedicine in the military and training tool potential for conducting CBEs. <br/> It is known that there is difference in the stiffness between cancerous and benign tissues.  The difference in stiffness also increases with the amount of strain in the tissues; thus relative stiffness as indicated by a tactile imaging device (such as the glove) rolling over tissue with ultrasound can aid in the discrimination of tumors.   </p>

<p class=""Default""><strong><img alt=""Sensor schematic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jaymung.com/comments/blowup4.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sensor schematic""/></strong></p></div>","UPDATE:  Thanks to everyone that contributed!  We didn't make our goal, but we gathered enough for some key parts.  We are going to updating everyone on our effort through our Facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Breast-Cancer-Data-Glove/399746566716836
 
The device is a glove that contains advanced sensors to electronically ‘feel’ for tumors during a routine breast exam. In addition to the clinician’s judgment, we hope the glove can generate data on suspicious lesions that require follow up.
We know getting a new cancer diagnostic tool is approved is going to be tough, so we're going to tackle these two problems first:
 1) Global Health/ Telemedicine: in many places there is no healthcare available.  We believe minimally skilled workers can perform these exams and then email the data to experts for analysis.
2) A Training Tool for Medical Students: this device produces empirical data that can visualize different types of tumors during a CBE, thus improving training.
Where does the money go? Your funds will go directly to paying for parts. Unlike other funding sources, no funds will go towards labor or overhead. 

ARFI ultrasound elements and electronics: $2k
Data acquisition device - $1.5k
Sensor board - $1k
Breast cancer phantom: $1k
Inertial measurement unit - $500
Glove and other sensor parts - $500
Soldering equipment and misc parts - $500
Why are you on IndieGoGo and not applying to Komen or NIH? These types of grants are typically set aside for projects already showing promise or data.  IndieGoGo will help us generate pilot data, which we can use for these grants.
Potential discoveries: Our goal is to create a glove that complements the clinical breast exam (CBE).  This device will record its own unique data as well as data from the clinician’s fingertip to provide an objective record of the exam.  This study will allow us to generate pilot data to apply for larger grants from institutes like the National Cancer Institute.

We will fabricate prototype of CBE augmentation glove which generates force and ultrasound data (3 finger tips) as well as joint angle (all finger joints).  This in turn, will be used to generate: 1) Tissue compliance data and 2) Normalized Δt signals from ARFI ultrasound.  Data will be calibrated against known samples.
We will use the compliance and ARFI normalized Δt signals to generate 2-axis time series test data to discriminate between control and ""diseased"" breast phantoms during mock CBE.
We will use an artificial neural network to generate ""tissue score"" to discriminate breast tissue properties.  A continuum of tissue score and confidence level versus disease phantom properties will be presented and assessment made for the inexpensive non-radiological imaging of breast tissue, telemedicine and training tool potential for conducting CBEs.
Who are you guys? A roboticist with a PhD in biomedical engineering from USC, an ultrasound scientist from USC and a breast cancer physician.
 

We’ve included more detailed information below:
Statement of the Problem: The device allows the standardization of Clinical Breast Exams (CBEs) through generation of objective tactile and ultrasound data.  Malignant masses generally are hard, immobile, and fixed to surrounding skin and soft tissue, with poorly defined or irregular margins.  Benign masses generally cause no skin change and are smooth, soft to firm, and mobile, with well-defined margins (Barton,et al., 1999).  These features can be discriminated by sensing modalities that detect difference in tissue stiffness: e.g. force sensors and ultrasound.  This represents an advance in increased screening and gathering of objective data for populations that are transient amongst clinicians such as military personnel.    Mammographic screening is also predicated on comparative analysis between mammograms.  This technology allows those same comparisons to occur. 
Statement of How this Problem or Situation is Being Addressed: We present a case for a Clinical Breast Exam Augmentation Glove: a device worn over a clinician’s hand that records finger position, joint angle, force and ultrasound measurements during a CBE to provide empirical data from CBE to CBE for patients.  This device represents possibilities in inexpensive non-radiological imaging of breast tissue, telemedicine in the military and training tool potential for conducting CBEs.  It is known that there is difference in the stiffness between cancerous and benign tissues.  The difference in stiffness also increases with the amount of strain in the tissues; thus relative stiffness as indicated by a tactile imaging device (such as the glove) rolling over tissue with ultrasound can aid in the discrimination of tumors.

<h6>              High energy Solar flares- Magnetic Pole shift-raised electromagnetic field aura and energy around intuned beings</h6>
<h6>Everything is made up of energy and energy never dies, it simply changes form. Our greatest source of energy in the solar system is the sun, which has the frequency and ability to not only create all things, but also destroy all things. Think about it; if the sun were to burn out today all things would die. Humans, plants, animals, and bacteria, even the planets would fall out of orbit. The earth is a rippled past energy or fossil fuel of the sun and provides us with food, shelter, environment etc. This means the sun and earth are our two most important energy sources.The sun gives us a natural electric energy and the earth gives us magnetic energy. When you combine this energy you get electromagnetic energy which permeates all things. This energy is also known as chi, prana, breath of life and ether. Currently we are in a Solar cycle of intense radiation. This energy is causing the poles to shift and dramatic weather changes which will reach an all time high leading towards December 2012.  This is neither good nor bad, it is simply nature rebalancing it's energies to cleanse the earth. Those who do not practice intuned living; meditation, vegan eating, sun gazing, yoga, chakra balancing etc will have bad effects on their cells. (radiation poison) Those who open their chakras, meridians, and prepare their cells molecular structure for excess energy will literally become advanced human. Martial arts has proven to be the best program to open up dormant DNA strands and prepare your body for the upcoming solar flares and pole shift. The reason Ninjutsu martial arts is the best program is because it focusses on mind, body and spirit training through physical exercise, meditation, proper diet, chakra balancing, focus and intunement with nature.</h6>

<h6>All energy can be converted into light, which is natures way of storing and transfering energy from one place to another. The human body is nothing more than a vehicle to hold the light/spirit while we experience our earthly lessons. This is the reason when people recall near death experiences they see themselves going to the light, which is a star, a sun, a major energy source, a celestial God source of energy. </h6>
<h6>The spirit of star people and Idigo's comes from stars outside of this Solar system. Therefore our DNA is more advanced and able to withstand and take in more energy. We have more active dna strands giving us the ability to me more than just normal. Because of this we also have a responsibility to help those whose souls are not as advanced.</h6>
<h6>Indigo's and Star people, from a lifetime of detailed study, fasting, sacred meditations and astral traveling, I have found the information, and secret knowledge to open up all your DNA strands, chakras, and meridians, so that when the planetary alignments happen and more solar energy hits the earth we will be the chosen ones who prepare, protect, and preserve the lives of the innocent.

<p>My name is Whitney Vittor, mother to three young girls. My husband and I are both small business owners who make enough to pay our bills but not much more.</p>
<p>Three years ago Danielle Crenshaw asked me to be Godmother to her infant son, Dylan Powell Crenshaw who was born on April 23, 2010. I was honored to be asked knowing how important this little guy is to his loving mother.</p>
<p>Dylan had a rough start. Before he was born he was diagnosed with hydrocephalus. After he was born he spent 8 days in NICU. At 6 months old he had a shunt placed to drain the fluid off of his brain and into his abdomen.</p>
<p>Since then he has been diagnosed with Hydrocephalus, Eosinophilic Esophagitis, GERD, Cerebral Palsy, Restrictive Lung Disease, Myositis, Hydronephrosis, Nephrolithiasis, 2 forms of Muscular Dystrophy- Walker Warburg (also known as muscle, eye, brain disease), and Bethlem myopathy, and a heart murmur.</p>
<p>Dylan cannot sit up on his own, hold his head up, walk, or talk but he can melt your heart with a single smile. He does not chew well and has to swallow 2-3 times to get a single bite of food down. He gets most of his nutrition from <em>EleCare </em>formula although he does eat some pureed type foods.</p>
<p>Dylan has been hospitalized more days than we can count. He is on growth hormone and steroids but remains in the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile for height and weight. He receives IVIg infusions every 2-3 weeks to try and keep his CK (muscle) level in a normal range. He has every specialist that there is and has travelled to Jackson, Mississippi and Iowa to see specialists. He still needs to go to Boston to see the specialists there.</p>
<p>Dylan requires special equipment and his needs grow as he grows. He uses a special bath chair, has a nebulizer for breathing treatments, uses special “Tumbleform” chairs to sit upright, has a wheelchair for mobility (although it doesn’t fit in his mother’s car, thankfully he can still fit in a stroller), and his newest addition will be a smart vest to help his lungs get rid of the extra mucous and keep them from failing.</p>
<p>Every day is a challenge and things most people take for granted Danielle and Dylan can’t do. She can’t take Dylan to the store to buy more than 3 or 4 things because he cannot sit in a buggy and there is only so much one can put on a stroller!</p>
<p>He doesn’t say “mommy” or “I love you” and he cannot walk to his mother’s room and crawl in her bed when he has a bad dream. He doesn’t give hugs or kisses or reach out to be picked up. But he is full of love and he is loved madly by anyone who meets him.</p>
<p>It isn’t the life Danielle imagined when she decided to have a baby but she wouldn’t change it for the world. Sure, she would give anything to take away the hurt he has and make his life easier but if asked, she’ll tell you that this life has given her strength that she never knew she had, compassion that she never thought possible, and a love that she will never have for anyone else.   </p>
<p>If we can join together as a community to share our blessings to help Dylan’s mom take care of his ever-growing needs and health care he will be assured to live as long as modern medicine and technology will allow.</p>
<p>To date donations have paid for his trip across country to undergo extensive tests to accurately diagnose him and more recently for devices to help him swim in a pool for the first time.</p>
<p>Dylan is grateful to have any help big or small. We hope you will make a contribution to his cause.  If a financial gift is not a possibility for you at this time, we ask that you please take advantage of the share tools available on this sight, telling friends and family about the opportunity to make a big difference in the life of an amazing little man.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is for Jordyn, my best friend.</p>
<p>On Columbus Day in 2011, Jordyn walked in to the New England Urgent Care Center. She had been sick for ten days with flu-like symptoms. She would later find out that she had a fever of 103 and an enlarged spleen. Jordyn didn’t return to her apartment for 18 days.</p>
<p>Jordyn would soon learn that she had Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). At first, she was told ""If you are going to get cancer, this is the cancer you want to get."" That turned out to be not be the case for Jordyn. What they meant, was that most patients can manage CML with medication. However, in Jordyn's case, the pills do not prove effective. She has worked with a medical team for 18 months to find a combination that worked and to combat her cancer, but in May of this year, the decision was made to move forward with a bone marrow transplant. At this point, essentially, her only choice. </p>
<p>Jordyn will be having her bone marrow transplant at Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women’s Cancer Center in Boston, Massachusetts. She will be admitted on July 31<sup>st</sup> and stay in Boston for approximately one month. During the first week she will undergo an intense pre-regimen of chemotherapy to eradicate most of the leukemia cells and suppress her existing immune system. On August 6<sup>th</sup>, Jordyn will receive her transplant. Jordyn is receiving her cells from a donor off of the national bone marrow registry who was chosen after her two brothers were found not to be matches. While the donor is not a perfect match, he is a single antigen mismatch that the medical team has deemed acceptable for transplant.</p>
<p>The road to recovery will not be an easy one. Jordyn is expected to be out of work for up to one year. During that time, she will be taking medication that will greatly suppress her immune system. Jordyn will be relegated to her apartment, with an intensley strict diet and hygeine regime and little contact with the outside world. As she prepares for her transplant, Jordyn has been spending as much quality time as possible with her family and close friends because in her words, ""the future is uncertain and normalcy will be a long ways away.""</p>
<p>This fund has been set up to help ease Jordyn's financial burden and help her as she goes down the road to get well. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise at least $15,000 for Jordyn. This money will cover Jordyn's rent, utilities, car payment and insurance, health insurance premiums, egg cryopreservation and storage, co-pays, her mother's stay in Boston, travel and any other expenses Jordyn will have during the six months to a year that she cannot work.</p>
<p>Jordyn has been through so much and is so strong, and I want to make sure that she can concentrate on getting well. Please help me to help Jordyn find happiness and comfort as she begins this road to recovery.</p>
<p>To begin to offer each and every one of you my truest gratitude, I, along with a gathering of Jordyn's best pals will be creating homemade gifts of thanks. </p>

</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">On April 18, 2014, <b>Solo violinist, Martin De

can happen to a fine violinist! </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>His bowing arm was crushed! ( please see ' Gallery' for a picture) </b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">He was biking through the streets of Amsterdam, just getting
back from a gig, he was traveling at great speed down a hill, then for some
reason his front wheel of the bike jammed and locked dead; with gravity taking
over, and the physics of motion, he was thrown head over heels over the bike steering
column, and slammed into the pavement. Trying to protect his head from hitting
the pavement, in that spit second, his used his right arm to shield it, this
impact crushed his right elbow! His bowing arm! He has undergone one surgery so
far, with more to come. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b>The most devastating and concerning issue now, with his
recovery, will he ever be able to play his violin again? </b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Being a violin soloist in Holland, his only source income
comes from his performances. <b>With the new Dutch Government and its laws, Martin
will receive very little insurance benefits as a
freelance musician.</b> <span style=""""> </span>If he is not
able to perform he has <b>a poverty level</b> of income, which will result in a devastating
financial disaster. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Martin de Deugd has performed as a soloist throughout Europe
and world over the past 20 years. <b>He has over 100 cd recordings as a soloist</b>.
Has performed in countless concert halls through-out Europe, including the
Concertgebouw Amsterdam , De Doelen in Rotterdam and The Queen Elizabeth Hall
in Antwerp.  </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Internationally, Martin de Deugd played concerts in Tokyo
and Nagoya and played recitals with the Canadian concert pianist Patricia Parr
in Toronto. Martin de Deugd has been a soloist in the Musical<span style="""">  </span>“Dietrich "" alongside Jasperina de

<p class=""MsoNormal"">He was in several musicals and shows concertmaster including

contributed to numerous CD and TV recordings of religious repertoire (

found in the Netherlands , but also a soloist at Notre Dame in Paris, the
Berliner Dom and the Copenhagen Cathedral . </p>

comes from his performances. With the new Dutch Government and its laws, Martin
will receive very little insurance benefits as a
freelance musician.  If he is not
able to perform he has a poverty level of income, which will result in a devastating
financial disaster. 
Martin de Deugd has performed as a soloist throughout Europe
and world over the past 20 years. He has over 100 cd recordings as a soloist.
Has performed in countless concert halls through-out Europe, including the
Concertgebouw Amsterdam , De Doelen in Rotterdam and The Queen Elizabeth Hall
in Antwerp.  Internationally, Martin de Deugd played concerts in Tokyo
and Nagoya and played recitals with the Canadian concert pianist Patricia Parr
in Toronto. Martin de Deugd has been a soloist in the Musical  “Dietrich "" alongside Jasperina de
Jong in the role of Marlene Dietrich . 
He was in several musicals and shows concertmaster including
Titanic , Rembrandt and the TV show "" Una Voce Particulare . He has
contributed to numerous CD and TV recordings of religious repertoire (
Netherlands Sing ) and is thus a soloist at concerts of many church choirs
found in the Netherlands , but also a soloist at Notre Dame in Paris, the
Berliner Dom and the Copenhagen Cathedral . 
Please help with a donation to Martin, so that he can
concentrate on his long road of recovery and many, many hours of physiotherapy. And
let him worry less about where the next Euro is going to come from to be able
to pay his rent and afford the necessities of life!
About Wendy Limbertie, Martin de Deugd’s fundraising campaign manager and cheerleader!From 1983 to 2000, Wendy Limbertie was principal horn of the Hoofstad Operette (Amsterdam Opera Company) and there is where Martin and Wendy met.

<h3>I was born without hands and one leg. I've been suffering from Chronic Pancreatitis since I was 16,at the end of last year I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. </h3>
<p>My name is Aldona Plewinska, I'm from Katowice in Poland. I was born without hands and a right leg. So far no one knows why I was born with a disability, despite the fact that on the ultrasound everything was all right. Doctors from the beginning gave me little chance to survive, because I also had too small heart which at any time could stop working. Now I'm 21 years old and I'm on the first year of the extramural studies in Journalism and Social Communication. Unfortunately because of the health reasons it is very hard for me to be at the university 12 hours a day every weekend. I have been suffering from <strong>Chronic Pancreatitis</strong> since I was 16, and at the end of last year I was diagnosed with <strong>Crohn's disease</strong>. What is it? It's a type of inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology, included in the group of non-specific inflammatory bowel diseases. It may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract but usually locates in the final part of the small intestine. Unfortunately, there is no medicine that would entirely cure the disease but doctors from Luxemburg, who treated me, recommended the <strong>HUMIRA</strong> (<strong>Adalimumab</strong> in the international language). <strong>HUMIRA</strong> is an immunosuppressant, a recombinant human monoclonal antibody. This medicine was first used in 2002 on patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, then it has begun to be used to treat other rheumatic diseases. It was not until the 2006 that the<strong> European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation</strong> informed, that <strong>HUMIRA</strong> can also be used to treat adults with Crohn's disease. I take the medicine in form of injections (one dose is 40 mg of solution) regularly every two weeks. The medicine is quite new and because of that a single dose, one injection 40mg of Adalimumab costs around 3000zł in Poland, in Luxembourg 500Euros. So far <strong>Hand an Hand foundation from Luxemburg</strong> has been funding the <strong>HUMIRA</strong> for me, I was their ward until I turned 18. Since that time I can no longer be the part of the foundation but they still help me financially. The Hand an Hand foundation has many dependents, mostly children from Brazil. They have been helping them for many years, therefore I would like to relive them from giving 1000 Euros each month on <strong>HUMIRA</strong> and that is why I'm asking you for help.</p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is 2000Euros, but any amount is very valuable for me.</p>
<p>In 2009 I started to model and take part in many projects. Since then I have had many photo sessions and there have been several television documentaries about me.<br/>I'm not doing this for money, just because it has been my dream since childhood to have a professional photo session. Unfortunately, is spite of so many photo shoots and other projects in which I participated I'm still lacking of money for medicines. <br/>It is impossible to make money on modelling, unfortunately no one wants to pay wages for the sessions and usually I do it for free.<br/>People with disabilities have a very hard life in Poland, the state pays pittance.<br/>With my attitude to life I would like to show all disable people that it is worth to fulfill your dreams and passions.

<p>Hi my name is Christina Smith and I would say that I have been a serious runner for about three years now. About a year ago I came up with a goal to run my first marathon when I turn 30. Even though I may not qualify for the Boston Marathon by then it's still a goal to run one. I'm turning 29 soon. I was thinking of doing a half marathon before running the big one. I tried to sign up last year for the half marathon but didn't make it in. </p>
<p>My training continued. Spring had ended and I hear some bad news from a close friend. She was diagnosed with breast cancer. I've never personally known anybody with cancer. I didn't quite understand what it was she was about to go through. She is only 32. She had a lot of support from friends and family, but it's still a physical, mental, and emotional journey she has to make alone. Dana farber was there to provide financial and emotional support. So when I saw that they had a Boston half marathon team I jumped at the chance to do my part.</p>
<p>Dana Farber asks runners for a $500 commitment. Funds will go towards cancer research and providing emotional and financial support those diagnosed with cancer. What they are doing is amazing. They are making a frightening ordeal manageable and less stressful. Their ultimate goal is to rid the world of cancer. If I do not reach my goal every penny still goes to Dana Farber and I will try to raise funds through other means. If I go over my goal I would like to donate most to Dana Farber and use very little for race day supplies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I can't imagine what she went through. It seemed painful, frightening, uncomfortable and agonizing even at times. She's the strongest person I know. She was able to even walk the Susan Komen 3 Day not even a month after a major medical operation. She is determined and empowered! And Dana Farber helped give her a healthy chance at life. This is my way and your way of giving somebody else that chance. Our chance to help an organization that empowers and gives hope where there would otherwise be no hope. </p>
<p>If this story hits close to home or if you know of somebody who may like to donate please pass this story on. Dana Farber is also always looking for volunteers as well.

            Around Thanksgiving i tried to contact my dad so i can wish him a Happy Thanksgiving. I never got a call back figuring he must have been busy at work because he always has his phone turned off the days he works. Well not too long after i get a call from my sister telling me our dad quit his job do to being sick and hasn't contacted anyone or asked for help. My sister found this out from his job who sent health inspectors to his house. Megan told me dad answered the door and the health inspector found he was ""out of it"" and very thin. As soon as Megan could she took a trip up to dad's and saw for herself how bad off he was doing. So a few days later she moved him in with her, her new baby and husband. The month he was living with my sister he became more ill and wasn't eating. My dad was just diagnosed with diabetes a few months earlier but there is no way that was the reason for his weight loss. 
           Monday Jan. 9Th 2012 i get a call from Megan, ""dad is in the hospital....he fell in the bathroom and busted his lip open and had to have stitches."" She also told me he had jaundice which she didn't realize he has because dad was always in the dark and didn't want to be bothered. Later that day i get another call, this time she was crying. She went on to tell me she got a call from the doctor and dad has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and he only has weeks to live. I didn't know what to think, just that i had to find a way to see my dad before he passes away.  
          I am currently living in Daytona Beach FL where i have been living for the past year and a half. All my family lives in California so coming up with the finances to pay for a plane ticket was nearly impossible. I called any family member i could to help me out with a ticket....nothing. Finally i talked to a cousin i just found out i had and she contacted my aunt i haven't seen since i was a baby. She gave me a call and said she could help me get a plane ticket, that she to was going to fly out from Hawaii to see her brother. The next day i get my ticket and pack for my trip.

The donations will get me a plane ticket back out to California to be there for my sister and the rest will go toward his funeral/memorial service. My sister and I are also setting out donation bucket to help out. If we don't reach out goal the amount collected will go strait toward his burial. No matter how much is collected i will always be grateful for the people who help out. If you donate i will personally write you a letter thanking you.)</p>

</div></div>","My sister Megan and I are trying to raise/collect as much donations as possible for my dads funeral after he passes away. The doctor said he has weeks to live but by the way he looks it might not be that long.
            Around Thanksgiving i tried to contact my dad so i can wish him a Happy Thanksgiving. I never got a call back figuring he must have been busy at work because he always has his phone turned off the days he works. Well not too long after i get a call from my sister telling me our dad quit his job do to being sick and hasn't contacted anyone or asked for help. My sister found this out from his job who sent health inspectors to his house. Megan told me dad answered the door and the health inspector found he was ""out of it"" and very thin. As soon as Megan could she took a trip up to dad's and saw for herself how bad off he was doing. So a few days later she moved him in with her, her new baby and husband. The month he was living with my sister he became more ill and wasn't eating. My dad was just diagnosed with diabetes a few months earlier but there is no way that was the reason for his weight loss. 
           Monday Jan. 9Th 2012 i get a call from Megan, ""dad is in the hospital....he fell in the bathroom and busted his lip open and had to have stitches."" She also told me he had jaundice which she didn't realize he has because dad was always in the dark and didn't want to be bothered. Later that day i get another call, this time she was crying. She went on to tell me she got a call from the doctor and dad has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and he only has weeks to live. I didn't know what to think, just that i had to find a way to see my dad before he passes away.  
          I am currently living in Daytona Beach FL where i have been living for the past year and a half. All my family lives in California so coming up with the finances to pay for a plane ticket was nearly impossible. I called any family member i could to help me out with a ticket....nothing. Finally i talked to a cousin i just found out i had and she contacted my aunt i haven't seen since i was a baby. She gave me a call and said she could help me get a plane ticket, that she to was going to fly out from Hawaii to see her brother. The next day i get my ticket and pack for my trip. Do to financial reasons, I could only stay to visit my dad for a week.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How Do You Use an ActivMotion Bar?</h3>
<p>1) Attempting to keep your bar level and the ball bearings stable and centered during your exercise. This is easier said than done because the ball bearings will always be rolling, challenging your balance, body awareness, and core stability!</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>2) Purposely tipping, tilting, and swinging the bar from side to side as the internal ball  bearings shift and generate momentum that results in tremendous core activation when they  “hit” the end of the bar!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Anatomy of an ActivMotion Bar</h3>
<p>ActivMotion Bars are hollow and partially filled with ball bearings that shift dynamically within. The graphics below highlight the major components of our products. You will notice that every AMB starts with a rigid steel tube that is powder coated with a textured gray finish for easy handling. The gray tube is then printed with graphics that indicate hand placement, bar weight, and product branding.</p>
<p>Each steel tube then has a PVC tube inserted telescopically inside of it. Within this PVC tube, the steel ball bearings are housed. Each end of the bar is plugged with a soft piece of rubber that insulates noise and cushions the ball bearings when they roll from end to end.</p>
<p>Finally, at each end of the bar, a steel rivet seals each end, ensuring the ball bearings can never come out. A colored end cap is tightly press-fitted over each end for a nice aesthetic finish.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476483247/neknd1d5nl2rx56ki58z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>ActivMotion Bars come in six weights: 4.5, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 18-pounds. The lightest three options (by far the most popular) are being made available during the campaign (initially).</p>
<p>Think of the available 4.5, 6, and 8-pound perks as the beginner, intermediate, and advanced options. We know that this amount of resistance doesn’t sound like a lot...but just wait! When the resistance is shifting, your body works nearly twice as hard to stabilize itself (see the science section below).</p>

<p>We are embarking on this entrepreneurial mission to bring ActivMotion Bar to the masses to help as many people as possible IGNITE™ their fitness and IGNITE™ their lives. Taking the best from our fitness professional education that has brought success to thousands of trainers and gym members all over the world, we are now inspired to create a full 60-day home training program that brings the same fun, innovation, excitement, and <strong>results</strong> to people in their homes.</p>
<p>The program will be comprised of simple, progressive 20-minute daily workouts that are delivered by great instructors. The workouts will be modifiable for almost anyone’s fitness level and will fit into almost anyone’s schedule. And these routines will be designed to ensure that every 20 minutes is spent maximizing core muscle engagement and caloric expenditure with the ActivMotion Bar!</p>
<p>To create this program and effectively advertise it, we will need to achieve our fundraising goal of $50,000. Here is how the money will be spent:</p>

<p>ActivMotion Bars are filled with rolling steel ball bearings that shift gently during movements, producing an unstable and challenging stimulus that promotes enhanced core and total body strength, increased balance, and improved flexibility.

<p>According to an independent study conducted at the University of Michigan in 2015, ActivMotion Bars activate muscles of the core and extremities up to 173% more than standard weighted fitness tools.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p>Q: How do I know which ActivMotion Bar is right for me?</p>
<p>A: Don’t stress about choosing the right ActivMotion Bars – every weight will give you a great workout! When making your decision, take into account your fitness level, age, and goals. If you’re a beginner, new to exercise, or are over the age of 50, try to start with the 4.5-pound. The 6-pound ActivMotion Bar is popular with those who are reasonably fit. Get the 8-pound bar if you are advanced. While every bar will give you a fantastic total body workout, many folks choose to purchase one of our multi-bar bundles in order to expand the variety and intensity of their workouts or to challenge themselves to progress to higher levels of fitness.</p>
<p>Q: If I order more than one bar, how do I tell you which ones to ship me?</p>
<p>A: We will email you promptly to ask which bars you would like. Don't worry....we have you covered.</p>
<p>Q: When will I receive my perk?</p>
<p>A: If you purchased hard goods like ActivMotion Bars, DVDs, shirts, etc., your order is guaranteed to arrive within two weeks of purchasing!</p>
<p>Q: When will the IGNITE 60-day home program be available?</p>
<p>A: If all goes as planned, IGNITE™ will be available on March 1, 2017.</p>
<p>Q: Is there a warranty?</p>
<p>A: All ActivMotion Bar (AMB) products are created with the finest craftsmanship and superb quality control. We are confident that our products will surpass your expectations of both quality and functionality. AMB products are warranted to be free from manufacturing defects for 90 days from the date of sale. This does not include normal wear, such as minor abrasions.</p>
<p>Q: Do you ship to locations outside of the continental U.S.?</p>
<p>A: Because of the high shipping costs associated with shipping individual orders internationally, we are limiting sales to the continental U.S. If you are outside of this region and wish to contribute, please contact us and we will do our best to connect you with one of our distribution partners closest to your region.</p>
<p>Q: Will the ball bearings come out or are they changeable?</p>
<p>A: No. Each AMB is permanently sealed at each end. The ball bearings cannot be removed for any purpose.</p>
<p>Q: Where can I get some workout content to start using my AMB right away until IGNITE™ is here?</p>
<p>A: You can download our free app, search YouTube, or purchase one of the DVDs that are available. Also, check out this <a href=""https://activmotionbar.com/how-to-use-the-activmotion-bar-at-home-until-the-ignite-home-program-is-here/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog post</a> for a great starter's guide!</p>
<p>Q: I placed my order between the campaign dates of 11/12/16 and 1/11/17. Do I get a copy of IGNITE?</p>
<p>A: Yes!!! You will receive a free digital copy of IGNITE when it becomes available in March.</p>
<p>Q: If I order after 1/11/17, can I still get IGNITE at no charge?</p>
<p>A: Unfortunately, you had to contribute to the campaign between our ""live"" dates of 11/12/16 and 1/11/17 to get IGNITE for free. If you order after 1/11/17, you can still get IGNITE at the pre-sale discounted cost of $39.99. This is still over half off of what it will retail for beginning in March.</p>

How Do You Use an ActivMotion Bar?
1) Attempting to keep your bar level and the ball bearings stable and centered during your exercise. This is easier said than done because the ball bearings will always be rolling, challenging your balance, body awareness, and core stability!
 

 
2) Purposely tipping, tilting, and swinging the bar from side to side as the internal ball  bearings shift and generate momentum that results in tremendous core activation when they  “hit” the end of the bar!
 

 

 

All of the video content available on our FREE APP and online will clearly guide you through usage in a simple, safe, fun, and challenging way!

The Anatomy of an ActivMotion Bar
ActivMotion Bars are hollow and partially filled with ball bearings that shift dynamically within. The graphics below highlight the major components of our products. You will notice that every AMB starts with a rigid steel tube that is powder coated with a textured gray finish for easy handling. The gray tube is then printed with graphics that indicate hand placement, bar weight, and product branding.
Each steel tube then has a PVC tube inserted telescopically inside of it. Within this PVC tube, the steel ball bearings are housed. Each end of the bar is plugged with a soft piece of rubber that insulates noise and cushions the ball bearings when they roll from end to end.
Finally, at each end of the bar, a steel rivet seals each end, ensuring the ball bearings can never come out. A colored end cap is tightly press-fitted over each end for a nice aesthetic finish.

ActivMotion Bars come in six weights: 4.5, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 18-pounds. The lightest three options (by far the most popular) are being made available during the campaign (initially).
Think of the available 4.5, 6, and 8-pound perks as the beginner, intermediate, and advanced options. We know that this amount of resistance doesn’t sound like a lot...but just wait! When the resistance is shifting, your body works nearly twice as hard to stabilize itself (see the science section below).

<p>Since face coverings have become a public necessity, we’ve heard stories from friends and family about the endless search for a perfect everyday mask. The common complaint was that most masks are ill-fitting and uncomfortable, especially for their children. </p>
<p>After sharing ideas and feedback with parents in our community, we designed a solution, the Fuji Mask.</p>
<p>With Japanese precision standards and attention to detail, the Fuji Mask was designed to be gentle for all skin types, easy to breathe through, and fit properly for all day comfort. By washing and reusing the Fuji mask, we can protect our environment and our loved ones.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Introducing FUJI Mask
Since face coverings have become a public necessity, we’ve heard stories from friends and family about the endless search for a perfect everyday mask. The common complaint was that most masks are ill-fitting and uncomfortable, especially for their children. 
After sharing ideas and feedback with parents in our community, we designed a solution, the Fuji Mask.
With Japanese precision standards and attention to detail, the Fuji Mask was designed to be gentle for all skin types, easy to breathe through, and fit properly for all day comfort. By washing and reusing the Fuji mask, we can protect our environment and our loved ones.

<p>Dogs are one of the world’s greatest biosensors, capable of detecting odours associated with drugs, explosives and food and are now being used in practice for public health.</p>
<p>We believe we could use dogs as a diagnostic tool to screen high numbers of people to detect people who are infected with COVID-19. If we can do this, it could help us to get back to normal life, quicker.  The project has begun but to complete it, we need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<p>This work could be profoundly impactful in the fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>The study is led by Professor James Logan who is the Head of the Department of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, along side Dr Claire Guest, CEO of Medical Detection Dogs and Professor Steve Lindsay, from Durham University, and their respective, highly experience teams. We are also working with local NHS hospitals in London.</p>
<p>We have already trained dogs successfully to detect the presence of malaria in human odour with a high degree of accuracy (see the TEDx talk video below!). Importantly, the dogs can detect odours from infected people who have no symptoms.  As well as malaria, we have trained dogs to diagnose cancer and Parkinson’s disease and many other medical conditions that change human body odour. If COVID-19 has a smell - we are confident the dogs will detect it.</p>

<h3>Does COVID-19 Smell?</h3>
<p>Many diseases change our body odour. This has been shown many times in scientifically robust experiments. Recent research on flu viruses, and other respiratory diseases, has shown that these diseases also interact with the human immune system and change human body odour. There is a very good chance that COVID-19 has a distinctive body odour. </p>
<p>Based on our previous work, we believe that dogs will be able to detect it with great accuracy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How Will We Do It?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Proof-of-principle:</strong> First we need to collect odour samples from people who are infected with COVID-19, and people who are uninfected. Then, we will use those odour samples with 6 dogs that are already pre-trained and awaiting training with the COVID-19 samples. Through an intensive training programme, we will test the method rigorously and, if successful, we could deploy dogs within as little as 8-10 weeks after training.</p>
<p><strong>Scale-up</strong>: If successful we will scale-up our operations rapidly to deploy the trained dogs during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. Once trained, our medical detection dogs could be deployed in airports or other venues to screen large numbers of people, providing a rapid non-invasive screening for COVID-19. One single dog can screen up to 250 people per hour!</p>
<p>Once we have shown this works, we will scale up operations on a global scale, by working with dog training agencies, the military and police forces, to deploy dogs in as many countries as possible. We are already in discussion with local governments and border agencies in several countries.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Are there any risks associated with this study?</h3>
<p>Any scientific study carries an element of risk, but from our own research, and work in other laboratories, we know that most diseases have a distinctive odour, and we think COVID-19 does too. If it does, we are confident the dogs will be able to detect it.</p> <p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGGY0bRKuDA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585774703/edfwi9z3pda01asqctrx.png"" src=""""/></a></p>

<p><b>I’m trying to help improve
care for dementia patients in the UK, and I need your help to do it.</b></p>
<p>Dementia is a cruel and indiscriminating disease, effecting
over eight hundred thousand people in the UK. It is mostly known as a disease
that takes away memories, but it also has serious effects on a person’s health
in general. </p>
<p>There may well be an eventual cure for dementia, but that is
some way off. Until then, all we have is medication and the dedication of
carers trying to do their best.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b><i>Is there anything that can be done today to help?</i></b></h3>
<p>Yes there is...</p>
<p>JustoCat is an interactive, therapeutic
cat, a CE Class 1 Medical Device, developed to provide calming support for people
with dementia.</p>
<p>It was invented by two Swedish University professors
specialising in clinical care and robotics. JustoCat has been proven in
clinical trials, and provides benefits to patients, professional carers and
relatives alike.</p>
<p>I would like you to watch the short film for a few
minutes and hopefully you will see how JustoCat can help support patients, carers and
families alike.</p><p><br/></p><div> <h3>

I’m trying to help improve
care for dementia patients in the UK, and I need your help to do it.
Dementia is a cruel and indiscriminating disease, effecting
over eight hundred thousand people in the UK. It is mostly known as a disease
that takes away memories, but it also has serious effects on a person’s health
in general. 
There may well be an eventual cure for dementia, but that is
some way off. Until then, all we have is medication and the dedication of
carers trying to do their best.
Is there anything that can be done today to help?
Yes there is...
JustoCat is an interactive, therapeutic
cat, a CE Class 1 Medical Device, developed to provide calming support for people
with dementia.
It was invented by two Swedish University professors
specialising in clinical care and robotics. JustoCat has been proven in
clinical trials, and provides benefits to patients, professional carers and
relatives alike.
I would like you to watch the short film for a few
minutes and hopefully you will see how JustoCat can help support patients, carers and
families alike. 





So what can you do to help?
I would like your to help by making a donation for JustoCat’s 
adoption into care homes and to start making real a difference for 
dementia patients, their families and of course the working lives of 
carers.
We want to reach a target of getting 99 JustoCats adopted into 99 care homes.
To achieve this target, we need your help to donate anything you can afford.
It will help. Thank you.
Even if you can't afford to donate at this time, you can still help 
by spreading the word to all those that you know, that might want to. 
The Indiegogo share tools will make this easy for you.

So who will receive a JustoCat?
I have a number of care homes waiting to receive JustoCat but you can
 nominate a care home, if you would like to, and I will do my best to 
get a JustoCat to them. 
Quite simply, click on the ""Contact"" link and then type in the

care home.
I will be publishing an evolving list of care homes who are about to receive a JustoCat, on this page.

JustoCat makes a difference
Together we can make a real difference to 99 care homes, more if possible, their patients, the relatives and the carers.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I discovered functional medicine while I was still a medical student and I have been obsessed with it since. While mainstream western medicine can be life saving in emergency situations, I was looking for a wholistic approach that helps people to to optimise their health and performance, by addressing the root cause of their issues. Functional  Medicine (AKA nutritional/biomedical medicine) is an evidence based, individualised approach that aims to recognise and address the root cause of disease, using diagnostic tests, individualised dietary and lifestyle  modifications  and other natural and low risk interventions based on nutritional science, genomics and epigenetics. I have discovered the power of nutrition when experiencing some health issues myself. While medication helped alliviating my symptoms, a simple change in my diet solved the problem completely. Since then I have been studying functional medicine in every free minute I have and have become extremely passionate about helping other people heal in the same way. I have completed the foundation course in nutritional and environmental medicine at the Australian College of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine and this year I am also undertaking functional medicine training at the Kresser Institute. This is an amazing program, that will allow me to provide the most cutting edge care to my patients. However, it is very expensive and I need your help in order to be able to complete it.</p>
<p>I intend to open the first Functional Medicine clinic in the upper Blue Mountains NSW, in February 2018. </p>
<p>The money raised in this campaign will go towards paying the fees of my functional medicine training. Help me make a difference!</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>In return to your contribution your will receive free or discounted consultations  when the clinic opens in February 2018. The costs of these consults will be much higher when the clinic actually opens, so this is a very good value investment!</li>
<li>I am 100% comitted to opening the clinic, even if I don't reach my crowdfunding goal.</li>

<p>“Most of us know the importance of hydration.  Yet, research shows that 40% of Americans are not drinking enough water each day. How can this be?  While exercise and diet dominate the health discussion and our consumer spending, perhaps the most important health driver - hydration - is something we ‘wing’ each day.   <br/><br/>KOR+ is a simple and easy, but also revolutionary, approach to daily hydration.  With each sip, the KOR+ adds molecular hydrogen (H2) and electrolytes to water, while also pH balancing and purifying in real-time.  <br/><br/>Drinking KOR+ daily helps activate your own antioxidant defenses, essentially turning your body on so you can fight free radicals, improve exercise and recovery, achieve weight loss, and defend against life’s daily stressors.”<br/> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Scientists agree that oxidative stress causes most human health issues. They also agree that antioxidants help fight oxidative stress.  It’s no surprise, then, that in more than 600 scientific studies, including at least 40+ human trials, molecular hydrogen has been shown to be therapeutic in nearly every human organ and in over 150 human disease cases.<br/> <br/>“Hydrogen is a novel antioxidant with great potential for actual medical applications.  Preliminary clinical trials show that drinking hydrogen-dissolved water seems to improve the pathology of mitochondrial disorders.

<td>We encourage you to bring KOR+ wherever you go! Just note that altitude or heat can cause pressure to build up in KOR+, which will cause water to spurt from the mouthpiece when the cap is opened. To prevent this, twist the lid open about a quarter turn to release the pressure. Then tighten the lid back on, sip and enjoy! (This reaction is quite common in closed containers such as lotion bottles, snack bags and other straw-based reusable water bottles).</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Will the KOR+ function without the filter in place?​</strong></td>
<td>Yes, it will work fine. However, due to the large volume of the empty filter chamber, it will take somewhat longer to get water into your mouth on the first sip.

<td>KOR+'s activated carbon filter is made from coconut shells, which are widely recognized as the most effective material for carbon filtration. After harvesting, the shells are converted to activated carbon using a proprietary process that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike coal, which takes millions of years to form and may contain heavy metals, coconut is a renewable and health-safe resource. The rare earth mineral blend is a proprietary blend of minerals that occur naturally and are safe for ingestion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Is the bottle BPA Free?​</strong></td>
<td>YES! As a company, we place the utmost priority on the health safety of our products. While there is still debate over the health impact of BPA, we didn't want to leave anything to chance. That's why none of our products contain BPA.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What is activated carbon?</strong></td>
<td>Activated carbon has been used for thousands of years to purify water. Here's why: In its natural state, carbon has a strong affinity for absorbing organic compounds such as chlorine and benzine. Activated carbon is simply a form of carbon that has been processed under high heat to become extremely porous (in fact, a teaspoon of activated carbon has the roughly the surface area of a football field). Combined with carbon's natural absorptive properties, all that surface area enables a tremendous amount of absorption when water passes through the filter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Is the KOR+ filter compostable/biodegradable?​</strong></td>
<td>No. This is because the coconut carbon in the filter is held together with a small amount of polyethylene binder. Otherwise it would disintegrate quickly. We are investigating ways of making the binder from a biodegradable material and hope to make a compostable version of the filter someday soon.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What do you mean about your filter being ""sustainably manufactured""?​</strong></td>
<td>Activated carbon is manufactured by heating organic materials to very high temperatures. This typically results in a large release of greenhouse gasses. Our supplier uses a proprietary process that reduces emissions by trapping greenhouse gasses and reusing them to produce thermal energy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Is my KOR vessel made from recycled materials?​</strong></td>
<td>No, but we're working on it. Our primary goal was to provide a BPA-free product using a clear, durable material. Eastman Tritan™ was therefore the obvious choice for the vessel body. But while Tritan is fully recyclable, it is so new that it is not currently available in recycled form. As the market for Tritan matures, we expect this will change.<br/><br/>In addition to Tritan, the side, top and bottom trims of the KOR ONE are made from ABS plastic. Recycled ABS is available, but we have not yet been able to find a supply that meets our requirements for color consistency and structural integrity. We continue to evaluate both recycled ABS and other recycled plastics and hope to someday offer a ""recycled"" KOR vessel that utilizes recycled materials for the trim parts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What certifications do you have?​</strong></td>
<td>KOR is working with labs that will independently certify the filter at NSF-42 as well as testing the water for presence of any harmful additives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Is the KOR+ vessel unbreakable?</strong></td>
<td>No. While made with durable materials and high quality manufacturing techniques, KOR Hydration Vessels are sophisticated pieces of engineering and are not intended for extreme physical conditions such as hiking or camping. When cared for properly, any KOR vessel will provide years of pleasurable and practical use.</td>

<td width=""200px""><strong>What is hydrogen water?</strong></td>
<td>Hydrogen water is water to which hydrogen gas (H2) has been added. Hydrogen gas, also known as molecular hydrogen, has been shown to have strong antioxidant properties.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What is an antioxidant?</strong></td>
<td>Antioxidants are organic substances found in foods and beverages. These power-house substances help you fight damage to your body’s cells caused by the process of oxidation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What is oxidation?</strong></td>
<td>Oxidation, sometimes called oxidative stress, is completely normal; however, it produces highly unstable and potentially harmful molecules called free radicals. Oxidation happens every day through normal activities, but it can be exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, smoking, anxiety and even pollution in the air. Oxidation is like rust in the body. It eats away at healthy cells</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What is a free radical?</strong></td>
<td>Free radicals are created through oxidation and are molecular fragments that are short one electron. We all create free radicals on a consistent basis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>How do free radicals affect my body?</strong></td>
<td>The formation of free radicals is completely normal and in some cases can actually have positive effects on the body. However, at high concentration levels, they can be harmful, potentially wreaking havoc on your cells, including DNA, proteins and cell membranes. Since free radicals are missing an electron, they scour your body trying to combine with healthy cells to steal an electron. The process sets off a chain reaction that can damage healthy cells and weaken your immune system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>What kind of damage can free radicals do to my body?</strong></td>
<td>Free radicals have been identified as a cause of many different degenerative processes in the body, including aging, memory degeneration, learning capacity, coordination and may even contribute to some diseases: cancer, heart disease, chronic inflammation and other neurological disorders.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>How do antioxidants like molecular hydrogen neutralize free radicals?</strong></td>
<td>As we age, our ability to fight off free radicals diminishes rapidly. Antioxidants are effective in battling this degeneration. Antioxidants, like molecular hydrogen, can benefit you in one of two ways. They can give one of their electrons to a free radical. Once a free radical finds an electron, it no longer needs to attack healthy cells. Another way antioxidants help fight free radicals is by going on the offensive and breaking down the free radical molecule, inhibiting its ability to attack healthy cells.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>Is this backed by science?</strong></td>
<td>Over 600 studies have been conducted on the benefits of hydrogen water. The studies cover multiple topics pertaining to oxidative stress and its effects on the body</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>How is KOR+ different from other hydrogen water products?</strong></td>
<td>KOR+ is the first bottle/filter combination that creates hydrogen water on demand without electrolysis. This on-demand feature helps maximize your intake of molecular hydrogen while you’re on the go. No outlets needed. KOR+ also has low environmental impact. Most hydrogen water products are single use water packets, creating more waste. In contrast, KOR+ is a reusable bottle with a filter that you only need to replace once per month.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>How does molecular hydrogen combat oxidative stress and free radicals?</strong></td>
<td>Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a powerful antioxidant! Concentrated levels of H2 have been shown to bolster the mitochondrial wall in your cells, helping to protect it from degenerative free radicals. H2 is also able to lend its hydrogen molecule to neutralize free radicals. i.e. neutralizing oxidative stress in the body.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width=""200px""><strong>How does KOR+ create hydrogen water?</strong></td>

How can this be?  While exercise and diet dominate the health discussion and our consumer spending, perhaps the most important health driver - hydration - is something we ‘wing’ each day.   KOR+ is a simple and easy, but also revolutionary, approach to daily hydration.  With each sip, the KOR+ adds molecular hydrogen (H2) and electrolytes to water, while also pH balancing and purifying in real-time.  Drinking KOR+ daily helps activate your own antioxidant defenses, essentially turning your body on so you can fight free radicals, improve exercise and recovery, achieve weight loss, and defend against life’s daily stressors.” 


 

The first water bottle system to purify, pH balance, and hydrogen-enhance water as you sip. 
 
Antioxidants to boost your body’s defenses and alkaline to fight acidity. 
Just like an apple exposed to air, our bodies are constantly under siege from the effects of oxidative stress.

KOR+ activates your antioxidant enzymes to fight free radicals and counteract oxidation. 

KOR+ raises pH up to 9.5, helping to balance your body from acidic foods and stressors. 

The KOR+ filter is made from coconut shells infused with rare earth minerals.  It not only removes impurities, but adds important electrolytes that help you stay hydrated.
 
A daily dose of antioxidant support through the power of molecular hydrogen (H2).  Research supports a wide range of health benefits from the role hydrogen plays in helping your body fight free radicals.
 
 
 
 

 

Scientists agree that oxidative stress causes most human health issues. They also agree that antioxidants help fight oxidative stress.  It’s no surprise, then, that in more than 600 scientific studies, including at least 40+ human trials, molecular hydrogen has been shown to be therapeutic in nearly every human organ and in over 150 human disease cases. “Hydrogen is a novel antioxidant with great potential for actual medical applications.  Preliminary clinical trials show that drinking hydrogen-dissolved water seems to improve the pathology of mitochondrial disorders. Hydrogen has biological benefits toward preventive and therapeutic applications”
“Acute oxidative stress causes serious damage to tissues, and persistent oxidative stress is one of the causes of many common diseases, cancer and the aging process….We have reported that molecular hydrogen has potential as an effective antioxidant for medical applications”

“Hydrogen-rich water might be an appropriate and safe hydration strategy that helps athletes to become less susceptible to exercise-induced acidosis.”Title: Is molecular hydrogen beneﬁcial to enhance post-exercise recovery infemale athletes?By:Drid P, et al. Sci sports (2016)
A 2010 study from the Journal of Clinical Biochemistry and Nutrition showed that when 20 overweight or obese subjects with symptoms of metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, insulin resistance) drank 1.5 to 2 liters a day of hydrogen water for eight weeks with no other dietary changes, they saw a 39 percent increase in an enzyme that fortifies the body against free radicals; a 43 percent drop in thiobarbituric acid, a substance linked to oxidative damage; and a 13 percent decrease in total cholesterol—results comparable to those of cholesterol-controlling meds.“What Is Hydrogen Water and Should You Drink It?”, Elle Magazine, April 2017
“Our recent work shows that hydrogen has unique effect on improving mitochondrial function to prevent and treat mitochondrial dysfunction-related diseases, such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. These exciting findings provide us strong belief that Hydrogen Medicine will have a brilliant future and play more and more important role in human health.”-DR. JIANKANG LIU MDUniversity of Southern California School of Pharmacy 
""...I witnessed with my own eyes in my own lab the remarkable benefits of hydrogen... I believe it is my mission to use my expertise in molecular biology...to help other people realize the medical benefits of hydrogen.”- DR. Kinji Ohno  MD., PhDNagoya University Graduate School of Medicine
“I learned about H2 as a potential radical scavenger that could more easily permeate the injured organs; although skeptical, our lab began investigations and were amazed at the protective effects. “-Dr. Jan Slezak M.D., Ph.D Slovak Medical University in Bratislava

 
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

Using a patent-pending process, ordinary water is pulled through the ""+capsule"" where it is instantly filtered, pH balanced, and infused with molecular hydrogen and electrolytes. It's super water on demand.

How do I set it up?
1. Detach straw from bottle. Remove filter from packet. Rinse filter in water for 30 seconds. 2. Insert filter into lid base with rubber plug facing DOWN (do NOT remove the plug). 3. Reattach straw to lid.4. Reattach lid to bottle.5. Press button of lid to open and enjoy (tilting of bottle not necessary — simply sip like a straw).


How do I clean and care for my KOR+ bottle?
Detach the straw and remove the filter. Put the filter in to the KOR+ Capsule storage unit while you wash your bottle.The KOR+ is a hand-wash only bottle. Use a soft bristle brush to clean the sides with warm, soapy water. If needed, use a small bristled brush to clean out the straw's mouthpiece.


Is it dishwasher safe / machine washable?
KOR+ and the KOR+ lid are both machine washable. Remove your KOR+ capsule before washing your bottle!


How do I clean my KOR+?
Daily washing of your bottle is necessary, since our mouths naturally harbor bacteria, it is highly recommended that you do wash your vessel daily.


How do I store my filter while cleaning my bottle?​
KOR+ ships with a KOR+ Capsule storage vessel for safe keeping while you wash your bottle.


When do I change the filter​?
Change your filter 1x/Month. Change on the 1st of every month


Is KOR+ safe to use outside the U.S.?
KOR+ was designed for use with potable water only. It will not remove harmful microbes, such as Giardia, which may be present in the tap water of some countries. We recommend only using KOR+ with potable tap water in the following areas: US, Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Nevertheless we encourage you to ensure your water meets the equivalent or better of potable water in the U.S. for which the KOR+ was tested.


Can I take my KOR+ to high altitudes, such as on an airplane or to the mountains? What happens if I leave my KOR+ in my car in warmer climates?
We encourage you to bring KOR+ wherever you go! Just note that altitude or heat can cause pressure to build up in KOR+, which will cause water to spurt from the mouthpiece when the cap is opened. To prevent this, twist the lid open about a quarter turn to release the pressure. Then tighten the lid back on, sip and enjoy! (This reaction is quite common in closed containers such as lotion bottles, snack bags and other straw-based reusable water bottles).


Can I pour filtered water from the KOR+ into a glass or a bowl for my dog if I tip it upside down?​
No, because KOR+ is designed not to leak when held upside down.


Can I drink juice, Gatorade or other flavored beverages from the KOR+?​
If you want to drink flavored beverages, just remove the filter and the KOR+ will work fine. Otherwise, you might ruin the filter and/or cause your beverage to taste bad.


Will the KOR+ function without the filter in place?​
Yes, it will work fine. However, due to the large volume of the empty filter chamber, it will take somewhat longer to get water into your mouth on the first sip. After that, the KOR+ air-tight seal will keep the chamber filled and you won't notice anything unusual on subsequent sips (unless you open the bottle which breaks the seal).


What happens if my filter freezes?
We don’t recommend freezing a moist filter because the water will expand when frozen, which may lead to breakage. Therefore you should inspect the filter. If it isn’t cracked or broken, it will still function.



What are the recommend ages?
All ages


Where can I use it?
Everywhere you go!


Is it safe?
KOR+'s activated carbon filter is made from coconut shells, which are widely recognized as the most effective material for carbon filtration. After harvesting, the shells are converted to activated carbon using a proprietary process that minimizes greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike coal, which takes millions of years to form and may contain heavy metals, coconut is a renewable and health-safe resource. The rare earth mineral blend is a proprietary blend of minerals that occur naturally and are safe for ingestion.


Is the bottle BPA Free?​
YES! As a company, we place the utmost priority on the health safety of our products. While there is still debate over the health impact of BPA, we didn't want to leave anything to chance. That's why none of our products contain BPA.


What is activated carbon?
Activated carbon has been used for thousands of years to purify water. Here's why: In its natural state, carbon has a strong affinity for absorbing organic compounds such as chlorine and benzine. Activated carbon is simply a form of carbon that has been processed under high heat to become extremely porous (in fact, a teaspoon of activated carbon has the roughly the surface area of a football field). Combined with carbon's natural absorptive properties, all that surface area enables a tremendous amount of absorption when water passes through the filter.


Is the KOR+ filter compostable/biodegradable?​
No. This is because the coconut carbon in the filter is held together with a small amount of polyethylene binder. Otherwise it would disintegrate quickly. We are investigating ways of making the binder from a biodegradable material and hope to make a compostable version of the filter someday soon.


What do you mean about your filter being ""sustainably manufactured""?​
Activated carbon is manufactured by heating organic materials to very high temperatures. This typically results in a large release of greenhouse gasses. Our supplier uses a proprietary process that reduces emissions by trapping greenhouse gasses and reusing them to produce thermal energy.


Is my KOR vessel made from recycled materials?​
No, but we're working on it. Our primary goal was to provide a BPA-free product using a clear, durable material. Eastman Tritan™ was therefore the obvious choice for the vessel body. But while Tritan is fully recyclable, it is so new that it is not currently available in recycled form. As the market for Tritan matures, we expect this will change.In addition to Tritan, the side, top and bottom trims of the KOR ONE are made from ABS plastic. Recycled ABS is available, but we have not yet been able to find a supply that meets our requirements for color consistency and structural integrity. We continue to evaluate both recycled ABS and other recycled plastics and hope to someday offer a ""recycled"" KOR vessel that utilizes recycled materials for the trim parts.


What certifications do you have?​
KOR is working with labs that will independently certify the filter at NSF-42 as well as testing the water for presence of any harmful additives.


Is the KOR+ vessel unbreakable?
No. While made with durable materials and high quality manufacturing techniques, KOR Hydration Vessels are sophisticated pieces of engineering and are not intended for extreme physical conditions such as hiking or camping. When cared for properly, any KOR vessel will provide years of pleasurable and practical use.


Are there any risks associated with use?
Our research and extensive vetting has shown KOR+ and its properties to be of little risk.



When does shipping begin?
December 2017


When can we expect it to reach our doorsteps?
We expect most KOR+ packages to be delivered in December 2017, but this is largely dependent on where you live.  


Where does it ship?
Globally


How much is shipping?
Shipping to the US is free. Other countries have varied shipping prices. Please see your selected perk for details.


Do I have to pay VAT / GST?
Yes

 

Is there a warranty?
Lifetime free replacement for subscribers


What is your refund policy?
Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis; at some point we will need to lock refunds in order to go into production & shipment. We will not be able to refund orders once they've shipped.


What is your return / exchange policy?
If you received your product and you aren't satisfied, you may exchange it for a new one within 30 days, less shipping & handling fees.


How can I check the status of my pre-order?
By pre-ordering through Indiegogo, you automatically have an account created. Log back into Indiegogo using the email you pre-ordered, to verify your information.


How do I upgrade my pre-order to a better one?
Email KOR via your Indiegogo account and a customer service representative will assist you


Why do I have to wait longer than usual?
This is not just pre-orders: You're helping to build the KOR+ vessel, and we need to know how many to make before we can start production. This is the first of its kind, and you'll be glad you waited. We will send you updates while we work to produce the first batch.

What is hydrogen water?
Hydrogen water is water to which hydrogen gas (H2) has been added. Hydrogen gas, also known as molecular hydrogen, has been shown to have strong antioxidant properties.


What is an antioxidant?
Antioxidants are organic substances found in foods and beverages. These power-house substances help you fight damage to your body’s cells caused by the process of oxidation.


What is oxidation?
Oxidation, sometimes called oxidative stress, is completely normal; however, it produces highly unstable and potentially harmful molecules called free radicals. Oxidation happens every day through normal activities, but it can be exacerbated by stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, smoking, anxiety and even pollution in the air. Oxidation is like rust in the body. It eats away at healthy cells


What is a free radical?
Free radicals are created through oxidation and are molecular fragments that are short one electron. We all create free radicals on a consistent basis.


How do free radicals affect my body?
The formation of free radicals is completely normal and in some cases can actually have positive effects on the body. However, at high concentration levels, they can be harmful, potentially wreaking havoc on your cells, including DNA, proteins and cell membranes. Since free radicals are missing an electron, they scour your body trying to combine with healthy cells to steal an electron. The process sets off a chain reaction that can damage healthy cells and weaken your immune system.


What kind of damage can free radicals do to my body?
Free radicals have been identified as a cause of many different degenerative processes in the body, including aging, memory degeneration, learning capacity, coordination and may even contribute to some diseases: cancer, heart disease, chronic inflammation and other neurological disorders.


How do antioxidants like molecular hydrogen neutralize free radicals?
As we age, our ability to fight off free radicals diminishes rapidly. Antioxidants are effective in battling this degeneration. Antioxidants, like molecular hydrogen, can benefit you in one of two ways. They can give one of their electrons to a free radical. Once a free radical finds an electron, it no longer needs to attack healthy cells. Another way antioxidants help fight free radicals is by going on the offensive and breaking down the free radical molecule, inhibiting its ability to attack healthy cells.


Is this backed by science?
Over 600 studies have been conducted on the benefits of hydrogen water. The studies cover multiple topics pertaining to oxidative stress and its effects on the body


How is KOR+ different from other hydrogen water products?
KOR+ is the first bottle/filter combination that creates hydrogen water on demand without electrolysis. This on-demand feature helps maximize your intake of molecular hydrogen while you’re on the go. No outlets needed. KOR+ also has low environmental impact. Most hydrogen water products are single use water packets, creating more waste. In contrast, KOR+ is a reusable bottle with a filter that you only need to replace once per month.


How does molecular hydrogen combat oxidative stress and free radicals?
Molecular hydrogen (H2) is a powerful antioxidant! Concentrated levels of H2 have been shown to bolster the mitochondrial wall in your cells, helping to protect it from degenerative free radicals. H2 is also able to lend its hydrogen molecule to neutralize free radicals. i.e. neutralizing oxidative stress in the body.


How does KOR+ create hydrogen water?
The KOR+ bottle contains a filtration and enhancement component that we call the +capsule. Embedded within the +capsule is a proprietary blend of rare earth minerals. Drinking from the bottle causes water to pass through the +capsule, infusing it with hydrogen gas.

 
How does pH balanced water help me?
KOR+ raises the pH of your water to an alkaline state, 9.5, which some have hypothesized has therapeutic effects; however, there is still research that needs to be done on alkaline to the same extent that scientists have performed studies involving molecular hydrogen.
 
What minerals are added to my hydrogen water?
The KOR+ capsule also adds Magnesium, Calcium, Phosphorus & Sodium",65.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our Organic Olive oil imported from Israel is made up of components that soften and strengthen your hair, allowing it to be used for protection against heat, UV rays and more.  It moisturizes your ends, helping to prevent breakage and frizz. It helps moisturize the scalp and is also a good source of antioxidants, which removes damaging free-radicals from the external part of your hair follicle and scalp. The benefit of protecting the follicle is to prevent premature aging that causes hair loss.  </p>
<p>By adding olive oil to hair treatments, it coats the outer layer of the hair, which makes it look smooth, shiny, healthy, and improves elasticity. A hidden gem that has been used for thousands of years.  </p>

According to one doctor ten thousand people per year just die. They drop dead, they die in their sleep, their hearts just stop for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>Through years of study, I believe I know why.<br/><br/>Hundreds of thousands of people in countries all around the world die every year because of toxic black mold poisoning, and yet most people are completely unaware of it. Wrong diagnosis and lack of proper attention are the main culprits and because of my own devastating experience, I feel compelled to do something about it.<br/><br/>To quote one of our sources: <i>""It is estimated that over 500,000 people in America die each year because of toxic black mold.""</i><br/><br/>Mold content in the world is massively on the rise and people are going to see a major change and a rise in the Mycotoxin sector of the medical industry itself to deal with mold and mold related illnesses. Mold affects our health, it kills people, plants, and animals. It consumes almost anything and yet it is one of the most misunderstood biological functions in the world.<br/><br/>Because of a severe lack of awareness and treatment, the problem with mold continues to grow on a global scale. As I stated earlier, I feel compelled to do something about it, and <b>this campaign to raise funds is my call to action</b>.<br/><br/>Hi, my name is Drew. My life has been completely changed because of mold and I am launching a new career in the nonprofit and medical studies industry to help save lives and to improve the quality of life for those who have been devastated by sickness and death as a result of mold.<br/><br/>There are currently no ""full time"" nonprofits specifically designated to mold. There are some part time and in very little capacity, and those only address certain issues because of a lack of knowledge, experience, and information. I have the experience in both business and mold sickness to launch a nonprofit dedicated to breathing life into a relatively new and unknown industry. <br/><br/>This fund raising campaign is to get the program started, and together with dedication and proper funding, we will make a difference.<br/><br/><b>THE GOAL</b><br/><br/>We are raising funds of fifty thousand dollars to start a nonprofit organization to help families and individuals who have had their lives altered by the devastating effects of mold poisoning. To help people with the recovery process of; regaining their health, getting their lives back together, and bringing a wide form of education to the public, government, and to medical organizations to deal with Toxic Black Mold Poisoning. We will offer health solutions, diet and exorcise routines to help recover damaged bodies, general and advanced education, and data to the medical community, with counseling for housing and career alternatives.<br/><br/><b>WHAT WE WILL DO</b>  ( People / Homes / Education / Community )<br/><br/>We will provide people affected by mold with nutrients and health related supplies to help begin the recovery process of bodily functions. These include foods, drinks, doctor approved supplements, along with a list of these things and what they do. We sit down with the victims of mold sickness and poisoning and their doctors and share the health information and education concerning the recovery process. These sessions will be made into video to further streamline and bring greater efficiency to the healing process.<br/><br/>We will evaluate housing problems to determine if they can be repaired or are they classified as ""Walk away"". We will search for, implement, and encourage housing assistance from local municipalities and organizations. We will also seek out alternative and emergency housing for victims.<br/><br/>We will compile a database of mold related information that will become a staple for the medical industry to use as a reference for treating mold sickness. This information will include; timelines, various nutrients found to have an affect on the healing process, progress reports, conclusions, and be made available to all industries that experience mold problems.<br/><br/>Although we will not be creating a new product requiring government approval, we will be seeking standard Material Data Safety Sheets (MSDS) to be issued to those industries in regards to mold. In addition, we are seeking cooperation with, federal, state, and local Environmental Health Services (EHS), and encouraging Community Environmental Health Assessment (CEHA) groups get involved as well. All of these under the direction of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br/><br/>Our goal is to help people regain their lives and create a full spectrum community awareness program that will become a household name.<br/><br/><b>ABOUT MOLD</b><br/><br/>Mold is a fungus / spore that grow in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. Molds pose a hazard to human and animal health when they are consumed following the growth of certain mold species in stored food. Some species produce toxic secondary metabolites, collectively termed mycotoxins.<br/><br/>The term ""toxic mold"" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins. In the world of science ""black mold"" is referred to as:  Stachybotrys<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1072908/files/20141205000032-stachyblack3spore-wb.jpg?1417766432"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Mycotoxicosis is the term used for poisoning associated with exposures to mycotoxins. The symptoms of mycotoxicosis depend on the type of mycotoxin; the concentration and length of exposure; as well as age, health, and sex of the exposed individual. <b>The synergistic effects associated with several other factors such as genetics, diet, and interactions with other toxins have been poorly studied. </b>Therefore it is possible that vitamin deficiency, caloric deprivation, alcohol abuse, and infectious disease status can all have compounded effects with mycotoxins.<br/><br/>In turn, mycotoxins (Mold) have the potential for both acute and chronic health effects via ingestion, skin contact, and inhalation.<br/><br/>-------<br/><b>Mold is an environmental hazard</b> and often regarded as an environmental disaster on a very small scale. We think of environmental disasters as refuse dumping and chemical spills, but the fact is, mold is everywhere and causes devastating disasters on a smaller scale, yet devastates lives and kills countless thousands every year. Mold has only one goal; to consume and digest everything it can.<br/><br/><b>HEALTH EFFECTS</b><br/><br/>Molds are common in household and workplace dust, however, when mold spores are present in large quantities, they present a health hazard to humans and animals, causing allergic reactions and respiratory problems. The symptoms of mold poisoning can be debilitating and the long lasting affect can bring a persons life to its lowest point of existence. <b>*</b>Studies show that exposure to high levels of mycotoxins lead to neurological problems and in some cases death.<br/><br/><b>*</b>Studies - There are actually only a few. We need multiple detailed studies.<br/><br/><b>SYMPTOMS OF MOLD POISONING</b>  (Typical of most people)<br/><br/>Muscle pain, cramps, burning, unusual shooting (ice pick-like) pains, headaches, fatigue, weakness, flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, shortness of breath, coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic sinusitis, sore throat, burning eyes, red eyes, sensitivity to light, difficulty with thought processes, memory loss, loss of concentration, confusion, disorientation, “brain fog”, dizziness, balance problems, metallic taste in mouth, numbness and tingling, temperature regulation problems, excessive thirst and urination, rash, mylar flush (face flushing), chest pains, Increased infections, the sensation that you are going to pass out, panic attacks, tremors, attention deficit disorder, vision problems, anxiety, depression, difficulty losing weight, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, chronic fatigue, nose bleeds and pulmonary hemorrhaging (stachybotrys), fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis like symptoms, cancer, joint pains, irregular heart beat, heart attack, can’t get a deep breath, difficulty handling any kind of stress, mood swings, irritability, sensitivity to sound, nausea, vomiting, new food allergies, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), poor insight into illness, stomach ulcers, and more.<br/><br/><b>Sadly, there is a story behind each of these items listed</b>. Imagine having almost ALL of the symptoms listed above... What would you do?<br/><br/><b>MY STORY</b><br/><br/>I'm Drew. I lost (Almost) everything, including my health because of mold. I was a business developer in Las Vegas. I worked in information services, real estate, IT and Technical services, telecommunications, technical writing, a consultant to all of the above and more.<br/><br/>This was my duplex apartment in 2007.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1074709/files/20141205150233-DrewsPlaceCWF--2sm.jpg?1417820553"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Toxic-Mold-Relief-Fund/306671849534366"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A few pictures inside.</a><br/><br/>I was making a living but I was not paying attention to my home environment. Through various circumstances the mold grew over a period of three years. You have heard the analogy of putting a frog in a pan of boiling water and it will jump right out, but if you put a frog in a pan of cold water and bring it slowly up to boiling, the frog will boil to death. This is because it slowly adapts to its environment.<br/><br/>If I had walked into my home for the first time and smelled mold I would have known there was something wrong. But in fact I lived in it and the mold killed off my ability to smell. <b>It killed off my senses and brain functions that allow me to protect myself and make good decisions</b>. It was like a biological war going on inside me. My body was the battle field and my mind was the PTSD aftermath.<br/><br/>I was getting sicker, thinking it was some other form of illness. Cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc... It wasn’t until a friend of mine called me crying telling me, “...you’ve got to get out of there now!” I had already lost a lot of my brain function leaving me totally dysfunctional and disoriented. I could barely do anything, or get anything done. My beautiful duplex apartment was a mess. I had chest pains and <b>I had made two trips to the emergency room because I felt my heart stopping,</b> then it would just start up again. It was scary and very painful. I never experienced anything like it in my life.<br/><br/>I could only sleep for one hour at a time. Then I would be up walking around for fifteen minutes, then go back to sleep for another hour. My diet was massively thrown off and I gained sixty-five pounds. And I had lost interest in everything.<br/><br/>I also <b>lived in a constant state of dreaming</b>, or a “dream world” for three years. From 2009 to 2012 I literally felt like I was dreaming and was about to wake up. This is a very disturbing way to live each day, Being in a state of ""dream"" all the time means major memory problems and a host of other nightmares as well. I moved to New Mexico to live with my father to recover. The move from Nevada to New Mexico in October 2010 is like a memory from a dream I had twenty years ago.<br/><br/>They say if you survive mold poisoning the typical recovery time is three to five years. I am in my fifth year and I am slowly recovering but <b>I live with tremendous bodily pain and disorientation every day</b>, I shake all the time, can’t focus on much. Thank goodness for my team.<br/><br/>The good news? I’m still alive. But as I rebuild my life instead of returning to the career I had, <b>I feel driven</b> from the impact of mold poisoning to help others who suffer from the same experience. My hope is to see that no one ever suffer from this deadly nightmare.<br/><br/>Much of my physical and bodily functions are damaged, and much of my technical abilities and in learning new things has diminished greatly, I cannot play chess anymore. However, I have a new found appreciation of art. I have always been a tech-know-geek and never gave art much attention, but now I enjoy visiting art galleries. The next big thing for me and my life is this new nonprofit and bringing relief to people who need help.<br/><br/><b>HELP IS ON THE WAY</b><br/><br/>Currently the only way I can fulfill my goal of helping others is to start a nonprofit organization to bring a professional approach to this problem. Fortunately I have several people standing by waiting to serve on the board and several friends willing to donate money to the nonprofit. <b>The key right now is to get this campaign underway</b> to raise the money needed to get things started. We are brand new. That's what we're shooting for with this campaign... that shot in the arm we need to get the nonprofit started.<br/><br/><b>THE SUICIDES MUST COME TO AN END</b><br/><br/>A staggering number of people suffering from mold poisoning commit suicide after months or even years of suffering and then being turned down by social security disability. There are no official studies to back this up. It's all stories from families and friends of people who have committed suicide. This is very sad.<br/><br/>One of my goals is to reduce the number of people who just give up. After what I suffered over the past five years, I can see why people kill themselves. From 2009 to 2011, I myself thought it would be better to be dead then to suffer with this nightmare. Every day there was an unmistakable feeling running through my body and my mind that I wasn’t going to make it. I felt like the end was near. I wasn't depressed, I was horribly sick. My mom would call and encouraged me to hang in there and gave me the positive affirmation of, “you’re going to live”. Everyday I would say to myself, “I’m going to live, I’m going to live...” I have dedicated the rest of my life to help people live through this tragedy. For those of you thinking about suicide... Please don't. There are so many things to live for. You just have to find them. My goal is to help you find them.<br/><br/><b>LACK OF DIAGNOSIS</b><br/><br/>Mold poisoning is a devastating sickness. While other diseases such as cancer, or heart disease have a diagnosis, mold poisoning is still relatively unknown. For many people who live in dryer climates, <b>there is no immediate diagnosis</b>. People suffer horribly while waiting for doctors to figure out what’s wrong. In the past five years I have seen 18 doctors all of whom are completely baffled as to what could be wrong because doctors are simply not trained for this type of illness, especially in the Southwest.<br/><br/><b>""Doctors have told me straight up on several occasions that they know little or nothing about mold.""</b><br/><br/>Some doctors just give up. One physician after;  all the tests, my failing health, severe pain, evidence of record, evidence of pictures, and solid evidence of moldy items bagged in a storage locker, this doctor concluded that it was all in my head. Are you kidding me? In my opinion this person clearly should not have been practicing medicine. At the very least she should have referred me out to a specialist, but she declared me mentally ill because she was more worried about concluding her diagnosis rather then seeking a cure. I never went back to see her again. My new doctor rolled his eyes when I told him that story, then he instantly referred me to a specialist. It's an ongoing procedure. I will ad more to my written experience as the nonprofit progresses.<br/><br/><b>MOLD WILL CHANGE YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFE</b><br/><br/>In my recovery I want to be encouraged and excited, but mold poisoning has caused me to become desensitized. In February 2009 my best friend died and I could not cry. <b>I felt completely devastated over his death and yet I could not shed a single tear because of desensitization</b>. Mold has often been referred to as “Hell on earth” and I now completely understand why. Once again thank goodness for the people helping me with this project.<br/><br/><b>THE TEAM</b><br/><br/>I have assembled a small team to help with this funding project and many of the same people are interested in helping with the nonprofit itself, so it is up to me to show them that raising funds to get this massive project started is not only possible, but how it will make an affective change in the lives of people who have had their lives destroyed by mold.<br/><br/>We are also happy to announce that we are enlisting the help of fiscal sponsorship from an established nonprofit that specializes in helping new nonprofits grow and maintain their position of success in the nonprofit community. According to attorneys I have spoken too about nonprofits, this is the preferred way to get a nonprofit off the ground. This is all coming together better than I ever expected.<br/><br/>I have chosen to start this project in the nonprofit friendly state of New Mexico. There is remarkable help with nonprofits in New Mexico, and branching out across the country in 2015 will be that much easier.<br/><br/><b>STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGNS / NONPROFIT</b><br/><br/><b>Stage One:</b>  The establishment of a nonprofit organization a as base of operation to begin helping families and individuals affected by mold. The $50,000 raised in this campaign will get the process' underway.<br/><br/>We already have families and individuals on the list to receive assistance from our efforts. The list is growing and we wait with great anticipation to help them.<br/><br/>Note:  Although this nonprofit is starting out in the United States, our goal is to reach the four corners of the earth to help out in countries everywhere where people have been affected by mold.<br/><br/><b>Stage Two:</b>  Begin the process of raising money to support the nonprofit, which will give aid to people who have been devastated by mold, and begin an awareness campaign that will open the eyes of doctors, the government, and the people, as to how deadly and destructive mold poisoning can be.<br/><br/><b>Stage Three:</b>  Create a foundation for the purpose of treatment and education. This is a long term goal in development that may take some time to be realized based on how much and how fast money can be raised. If enough money is donated we will do this sooner.<br/><br/>We will be publishing written and digital educational materials that could potentially become part of medical schools’ curriculum. Once the program is underwritten by doctors and approved by FDA, our long term goal is to see the knowledge and education of the subject of mold to become common knowledge among doctors and in medical universities in every country.<br/><br/>-------<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1072998/files/20141205013047-green-leaf.jpg?1417771847"" src="""" style=""width: 170px; height: 165px;""/></p>It should be noted that because of a diverse back ground in technology, former experience with solar energy, and a passion for humanity, all the stages of growth experienced with this new nonprofit will be kept in strict accordance with green technologies. We will perform as any well structured business, but our preference of running a business will always support sustainable futures.<br/><br/><b>PERKS</b><br/><br/>This is our very first campaign, and being that money is scarce, we have no real, tangible perks that would sit in a trophy case or anything like that, however...<br/><br/>We are pleased to say that a generous and anonymous individual has offered to donate a small number of papers written on various subjects that range from facts and commentaries to educational, from medical information to controversial social issues, and things you always wanted to know or wondered about.<br/><br/>These papers are one hundred percent (100%) ours in ownership to give 
away. They are not copyrighted but we have the original treatise work. (We own the originals). They are perks to anyone who would enjoy
 reading some interesting material.

According to one doctor ten thousand people per year just die. They drop dead, they die in their sleep, their hearts just stop for no apparent reason.Through years of study, I believe I know why.Hundreds of thousands of people in countries all around the world die every year because of toxic black mold poisoning, and yet most people are completely unaware of it. Wrong diagnosis and lack of proper attention are the main culprits and because of my own devastating experience, I feel compelled to do something about it.To quote one of our sources: ""It is estimated that over 500,000 people in America die each year because of toxic black mold.""Mold content in the world is massively on the rise and people are going to see a major change and a rise in the Mycotoxin sector of the medical industry itself to deal with mold and mold related illnesses. Mold affects our health, it kills people, plants, and animals. It consumes almost anything and yet it is one of the most misunderstood biological functions in the world.Because of a severe lack of awareness and treatment, the problem with mold continues to grow on a global scale. As I stated earlier, I feel compelled to do something about it, and this campaign to raise funds is my call to action.Hi, my name is Drew. My life has been completely changed because of mold and I am launching a new career in the nonprofit and medical studies industry to help save lives and to improve the quality of life for those who have been devastated by sickness and death as a result of mold.There are currently no ""full time"" nonprofits specifically designated to mold. There are some part time and in very little capacity, and those only address certain issues because of a lack of knowledge, experience, and information. I have the experience in both business and mold sickness to launch a nonprofit dedicated to breathing life into a relatively new and unknown industry. This fund raising campaign is to get the program started, and together with dedication and proper funding, we will make a difference.THE GOALWe are raising funds of fifty thousand dollars to start a nonprofit organization to help families and individuals who have had their lives altered by the devastating effects of mold poisoning. To help people with the recovery process of; regaining their health, getting their lives back together, and bringing a wide form of education to the public, government, and to medical organizations to deal with Toxic Black Mold Poisoning. We will offer health solutions, diet and exorcise routines to help recover damaged bodies, general and advanced education, and data to the medical community, with counseling for housing and career alternatives.WHAT WE WILL DO  ( People / Homes / Education / Community )We will provide people affected by mold with nutrients and health related supplies to help begin the recovery process of bodily functions. These include foods, drinks, doctor approved supplements, along with a list of these things and what they do. We sit down with the victims of mold sickness and poisoning and their doctors and share the health information and education concerning the recovery process. These sessions will be made into video to further streamline and bring greater efficiency to the healing process.We will evaluate housing problems to determine if they can be repaired or are they classified as ""Walk away"". We will search for, implement, and encourage housing assistance from local municipalities and organizations. We will also seek out alternative and emergency housing for victims.We will compile a database of mold related information that will become a staple for the medical industry to use as a reference for treating mold sickness. This information will include; timelines, various nutrients found to have an affect on the healing process, progress reports, conclusions, and be made available to all industries that experience mold problems.Although we will not be creating a new product requiring government approval, we will be seeking standard Material Data Safety Sheets (MSDS) to be issued to those industries in regards to mold. In addition, we are seeking cooperation with, federal, state, and local Environmental Health Services (EHS), and encouraging Community Environmental Health Assessment (CEHA) groups get involved as well. All of these under the direction of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Our goal is to help people regain their lives and create a full spectrum community awareness program that will become a household name.ABOUT MOLDMold is a fungus / spore that grow in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. Molds pose a hazard to human and animal health when they are consumed following the growth of certain mold species in stored food. Some species produce toxic secondary metabolites, collectively termed mycotoxins.The term ""toxic mold"" refers to molds that produce mycotoxins. In the world of science ""black mold"" is referred to as:  StachybotrysMycotoxicosis is the term used for poisoning associated with exposures to mycotoxins. The symptoms of mycotoxicosis depend on the type of mycotoxin; the concentration and length of exposure; as well as age, health, and sex of the exposed individual. The synergistic effects associated with several other factors such as genetics, diet, and interactions with other toxins have been poorly studied. Therefore it is possible that vitamin deficiency, caloric deprivation, alcohol abuse, and infectious disease status can all have compounded effects with mycotoxins.In turn, mycotoxins (Mold) have the potential for both acute and chronic health effects via ingestion, skin contact, and inhalation.-------Mold is an environmental hazard and often regarded as an environmental disaster on a very small scale. We think of environmental disasters as refuse dumping and chemical spills, but the fact is, mold is everywhere and causes devastating disasters on a smaller scale, yet devastates lives and kills countless thousands every year. Mold has only one goal; to consume and digest everything it can.HEALTH EFFECTSMolds are common in household and workplace dust, however, when mold spores are present in large quantities, they present a health hazard to humans and animals, causing allergic reactions and respiratory problems. The symptoms of mold poisoning can be debilitating and the long lasting affect can bring a persons life to its lowest point of existence. *Studies show that exposure to high levels of mycotoxins lead to neurological problems and in some cases death.*Studies - There are actually only a few. We need multiple detailed studies.SYMPTOMS OF MOLD POISONING  (Typical of most people)Muscle pain, cramps, burning, unusual shooting (ice pick-like) pains, headaches, fatigue, weakness, flu-like symptoms, fever, chills, shortness of breath, coughing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, chronic sinusitis, sore throat, burning eyes, red eyes, sensitivity to light, difficulty with thought processes, memory loss, loss of concentration, confusion, disorientation, “brain fog”, dizziness, balance problems, metallic taste in mouth, numbness and tingling, temperature regulation problems, excessive thirst and urination, rash, mylar flush (face flushing), chest pains, Increased infections, the sensation that you are going to pass out, panic attacks, tremors, attention deficit disorder, vision problems, anxiety, depression, difficulty losing weight, ringing in the ears, hearing loss, chronic fatigue, nose bleeds and pulmonary hemorrhaging (stachybotrys), fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis like symptoms, cancer, joint pains, irregular heart beat, heart attack, can’t get a deep breath, difficulty handling any kind of stress, mood swings, irritability, sensitivity to sound, nausea, vomiting, new food allergies, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes), poor insight into illness, stomach ulcers, and more.Sadly, there is a story behind each of these items listed. Imagine having almost ALL of the symptoms listed above... What would you do?MY STORYI'm Drew. I lost (Almost) everything, including my health because of mold. I was a business developer in Las Vegas. I worked in information services, real estate, IT and Technical services, telecommunications, technical writing, a consultant to all of the above and more.This was my duplex apartment in 2007.A few pictures inside.I was making a living but I was not paying attention to my home environment. Through various circumstances the mold grew over a period of three years. You have heard the analogy of putting a frog in a pan of boiling water and it will jump right out, but if you put a frog in a pan of cold water and bring it slowly up to boiling, the frog will boil to death. This is because it slowly adapts to its environment.If I had walked into my home for the first time and smelled mold I would have known there was something wrong. But in fact I lived in it and the mold killed off my ability to smell. It killed off my senses and brain functions that allow me to protect myself and make good decisions. It was like a biological war going on inside me. My body was the battle field and my mind was the PTSD aftermath.I was getting sicker, thinking it was some other form of illness. Cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc... It wasn’t until a friend of mine called me crying telling me, “...you’ve got to get out of there now!” I had already lost a lot of my brain function leaving me totally dysfunctional and disoriented. I could barely do anything, or get anything done. My beautiful duplex apartment was a mess. I had chest pains and I had made two trips to the emergency room because I felt my heart stopping, then it would just start up again. It was scary and very painful. I never experienced anything like it in my life.I could only sleep for one hour at a time. Then I would be up walking around for fifteen minutes, then go back to sleep for another hour. My diet was massively thrown off and I gained sixty-five pounds. And I had lost interest in everything.I also lived in a constant state of dreaming, or a “dream world” for three years. From 2009 to 2012 I literally felt like I was dreaming and was about to wake up. This is a very disturbing way to live each day, Being in a state of ""dream"" all the time means major memory problems and a host of other nightmares as well. I moved to New Mexico to live with my father to recover. The move from Nevada to New Mexico in October 2010 is like a memory from a dream I had twenty years ago.They say if you survive mold poisoning the typical recovery time is three to five years. I am in my fifth year and I am slowly recovering but I live with tremendous bodily pain and disorientation every day, I shake all the time, can’t focus on much. Thank goodness for my team.The good news? I’m still alive. But as I rebuild my life instead of returning to the career I had, I feel driven from the impact of mold poisoning to help others who suffer from the same experience. My hope is to see that no one ever suffer from this deadly nightmare.Much of my physical and bodily functions are damaged, and much of my technical abilities and in learning new things has diminished greatly, I cannot play chess anymore. However, I have a new found appreciation of art. I have always been a tech-know-geek and never gave art much attention, but now I enjoy visiting art galleries. The next big thing for me and my life is this new nonprofit and bringing relief to people who need help.HELP IS ON THE WAYCurrently the only way I can fulfill my goal of helping others is to start a nonprofit organization to bring a professional approach to this problem. Fortunately I have several people standing by waiting to serve on the board and several friends willing to donate money to the nonprofit. The key right now is to get this campaign underway to raise the money needed to get things started. We are brand new. That's what we're shooting for with this campaign... that shot in the arm we need to get the nonprofit started.THE SUICIDES MUST COME TO AN ENDA staggering number of people suffering from mold poisoning commit suicide after months or even years of suffering and then being turned down by social security disability. There are no official studies to back this up. It's all stories from families and friends of people who have committed suicide. This is very sad.One of my goals is to reduce the number of people who just give up. After what I suffered over the past five years, I can see why people kill themselves. From 2009 to 2011, I myself thought it would be better to be dead then to suffer with this nightmare. Every day there was an unmistakable feeling running through my body and my mind that I wasn’t going to make it. I felt like the end was near. I wasn't depressed, I was horribly sick. My mom would call and encouraged me to hang in there and gave me the positive affirmation of, “you’re going to live”. Everyday I would say to myself, “I’m going to live, I’m going to live...” I have dedicated the rest of my life to help people live through this tragedy. For those of you thinking about suicide... Please don't. There are so many things to live for. You just have to find them. My goal is to help you find them.LACK OF DIAGNOSISMold poisoning is a devastating sickness. While other diseases such as cancer, or heart disease have a diagnosis, mold poisoning is still relatively unknown. For many people who live in dryer climates, there is no immediate diagnosis. People suffer horribly while waiting for doctors to figure out what’s wrong. In the past five years I have seen 18 doctors all of whom are completely baffled as to what could be wrong because doctors are simply not trained for this type of illness, especially in the Southwest.""Doctors have told me straight up on several occasions that they know little or nothing about mold.""Some doctors just give up. One physician after;  all the tests, my failing health, severe pain, evidence of record, evidence of pictures, and solid evidence of moldy items bagged in a storage locker, this doctor concluded that it was all in my head. Are you kidding me? In my opinion this person clearly should not have been practicing medicine. At the very least she should have referred me out to a specialist, but she declared me mentally ill because she was more worried about concluding her diagnosis rather then seeking a cure. I never went back to see her again. My new doctor rolled his eyes when I told him that story, then he instantly referred me to a specialist. It's an ongoing procedure. I will ad more to my written experience as the nonprofit progresses.MOLD WILL CHANGE YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFEIn my recovery I want to be encouraged and excited, but mold poisoning has caused me to become desensitized. In February 2009 my best friend died and I could not cry. I felt completely devastated over his death and yet I could not shed a single tear because of desensitization. Mold has often been referred to as “Hell on earth” and I now completely understand why. Once again thank goodness for the people helping me with this project.THE TEAMI have assembled a small team to help with this funding project and many of the same people are interested in helping with the nonprofit itself, so it is up to me to show them that raising funds to get this massive project started is not only possible, but how it will make an affective change in the lives of people who have had their lives destroyed by mold.We are also happy to announce that we are enlisting the help of fiscal sponsorship from an established nonprofit that specializes in helping new nonprofits grow and maintain their position of success in the nonprofit community. According to attorneys I have spoken too about nonprofits, this is the preferred way to get a nonprofit off the ground. This is all coming together better than I ever expected.I have chosen to start this project in the nonprofit friendly state of New Mexico. There is remarkable help with nonprofits in New Mexico, and branching out across the country in 2015 will be that much easier.STAGES OF THE CAMPAIGNS / NONPROFITStage One:  The establishment of a nonprofit organization a as base of operation to begin helping families and individuals affected by mold. The $50,000 raised in this campaign will get the process' underway.We already have families and individuals on the list to receive assistance from our efforts. The list is growing and we wait with great anticipation to help them.Note:  Although this nonprofit is starting out in the United States, our goal is to reach the four corners of the earth to help out in countries everywhere where people have been affected by mold.Stage Two:  Begin the process of raising money to support the nonprofit, which will give aid to people who have been devastated by mold, and begin an awareness campaign that will open the eyes of doctors, the government, and the people, as to how deadly and destructive mold poisoning can be.Stage Three:  Create a foundation for the purpose of treatment and education. This is a long term goal in development that may take some time to be realized based on how much and how fast money can be raised. If enough money is donated we will do this sooner.We will be publishing written and digital educational materials that could potentially become part of medical schools’ curriculum. Once the program is underwritten by doctors and approved by FDA, our long term goal is to see the knowledge and education of the subject of mold to become common knowledge among doctors and in medical universities in every country.-------It should be noted that because of a diverse back ground in technology, former experience with solar energy, and a passion for humanity, all the stages of growth experienced with this new nonprofit will be kept in strict accordance with green technologies. We will perform as any well structured business, but our preference of running a business will always support sustainable futures.PERKSThis is our very first campaign, and being that money is scarce, we have no real, tangible perks that would sit in a trophy case or anything like that, however...We are pleased to say that a generous and anonymous individual has offered to donate a small number of papers written on various subjects that range from facts and commentaries to educational, from medical information to controversial social issues, and things you always wanted to know or wondered about.These papers are one hundred percent (100%) ours in ownership to give 
away. They are not copyrighted but we have the original treatise work. (We own the originals). They are perks to anyone who would enjoy
 reading some interesting material. Many of these papers can be used to spark new threads on web pages looking for material to talk about or debate, or just be informative.The number of written materials and other perks will increase with future campaigns.Please note:  It is our deepest hope and sincerity that people will donate based on wanting to see this horrible medical condition and environmental hazard brought to light, addressed properly, and brought under control. We want to bring the help needed for all who have been affected. The perks will get better as we acquire the money to do so.THE END GAMEThis nonprofit will save lives, create jobs, and ad medical and biological data to the world's current teachings. It will protect the sustainable future of people’s lives and their general health, along with plants, animals, the businesses we go to everyday, and the homes we live in.CLOSINGThe reason mold is killing so many people and doctors know so little about it is because the pharmaceutical community has no safe pill you can take for mold related problems.

A skilled CranioSacral therapist has the ability to facilitate lasting healing in a person, be it physical, mental, emotional or spiritual. In other parts of the world, (eg:  the UK and Australia) CranioSacral Therapy has taken root and is popular.In North America we are at the beginning of this wave. There are only a small handful of registered and licensed CranioSacral therapists that live and work in Vancouver. To date, there has never been a Centre opened with numerous therapists that offer CranioSacral Therapy sessions to the public. Three months ago we changed that.We brought together a small group of dedicated and caring CranioSacral practitioners and began our vision of building a clinic in the heart of the West End of Vancouver. Our intention was to make this miraculous therapy easily accessible and available to members of the public in a warm and welcoming environment. We assembled a team to help build our vision.Click here for more information on our teamWe began to work on a business plan that would bring in our start-up financing.  Working alongside Small Business B.C., we took the traditional route of applying for a small business bank loan. It was a long process and while it was underway, we began the physical construction of our clinic. Before we knew it, we had a general contractor, a plumber, an electrician, a printer and a web designer all join in, offering their services IN GOOD FAITH! It took 2 months and we had successfully constructed a beautiful, welcoming CranioSacral Therapy clinic in the heart of the West End of Vancouver.On July 26th, 2013 we opened our doors to the public.  We gave a total of 10 cranial sessions in our two little treatment rooms and people were thrilled with the results… we were buzzing with pride and happinessTwo weeks later, after passing through four different levels of approval, we learned that our bank loan application had not met with the final green light.  Which meant we did not have the money to pay all the contractors that had already finished working for us!  Life went on and people kept showing up in our clinic wanting to learn about our services and we grew busier doing what we do best – giving CranioSacral Therapy sessions to people who wanted to heal!With the support of a small handful of generous friends and family, we were able to meet our most basic financial obligations and give small token payments to all of our contractors.  The bulk of their invoices, however, still remained unpaid.  Which is what brings us here!  To this Indiegogo crowd funding website…We are reaching out to everyone out there who recognizes the value of CranioSacral Therapy and is as excited as we are to see it being finally being introduced in Western Canada.  We are also appealing to all those who value relationships and are equally as touched as we are to recognize and honour the amazing trust that was given to us by the people who worked long and hard before there was even any money available to pay them for their efforts.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am the director of World Health Equity, an organization seeking to improve health equity for vulnerable populations. This July, I was in Sierra Leone managing our maternal health program in conjunction with international and national partners. Along with our team, I visited health providers at over 100 facilities. One day, I suddenly came
down with a fever. Within 3 hours, I went from energetically training maternal health responders to shaking and shivering violently.  I was weak and my body ached to an excruciating
degree. My symptoms were typical of malaria. However, my work put me at significantly higher risk of contracting Ebola.  </p>
<p>The two days it
took for my blood tests to process seemed to last a lifetime. As my condition
grew worse and I started to vomit, I realized that what scared me was not that
I could be awaiting death. Surprisingly I could accept that possibility. What
drove me to feel helpless and terrified, was the knowledge that if I had Ebola,
that I would die without saying good-bye to my loved ones. Diseases cost lives
every second of every day. For me, what is so ruthless about Ebola in
particular, is the way it forces victims to anticipate death, be ostracized and
feared, and remain void of human touch and personal connection. My test results
came back negative for Ebola. I had never been happier to have Malaria and to
feel the physical touch of family and friends through illness. </p>

micro-circulation and oxygenation. The fabric also generates negative ions,
which help charge the body’s cells.</p>

produce a luxuriously soft texture, we embedded authentic crushed pearls within
the fabric.</p>

CAMPAIGN GOAL

Through Indiegogo, we want to
introduce to the world our unique and highly advanced living activewear
collection. With your support, we’ll be able to fund the first production run
of our DYLN InspiredTM apparel and continue researching the
effect of our VitaPearlTM fabric on the human body.
OUR VISION
We developed a line of activewear from specially constructed fabric
carrying cutting edge nano-technology that improves the body’s performance and
healing capabilities. Though this, we hope to make it simpler for you to live as
your fullest and most powerful potential.
WHO IS DYLN INSPIREDTM?
A
wellness-oriented community of entrepreneurs, yogins, designers, and
health-enthusiasts, the company aims to spread the feeling of optimal health
and superior performance.
We live DYLN Inspired because we each pursue true health and deep
personal fulfillment.













THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE
DYLN
InspiredTM living activewear makes you feel good and perform excellently
on a deep cellular level.
CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY: VITAPEARLTM FABRIC
We
engineered this fabric to deliver unparalleled health-enhancing capabilities. The
embedded Bio-Photonic nano-technology emits far-infrared, which increases
micro-circulation and oxygenation. The fabric also generates negative ions,
which help charge the body’s cells.
PERFORMANCE 
The
fabric was built for sustainable health and sustainable performance, so we made
sure it includes the moisture management, support, and stretch you expect from
clothes designed for practice.
UNIQUE COMFORT
To
produce a luxuriously soft texture, we embedded authentic crushed pearls within
the fabric.
ELEGANT DESIGN
DYLN Inspired Line of Tops
DYLN Inspired Line of BottomsDETAILS AND SIZINGWe will send you product details, sizing information, and color options after your order is placed and the campaign has ended.








Among the
benefits being researched of wearing the VitaPearl fabric are:





Improved micro-circulation


Increased muscular oxygenation


Quicker recovery from physical activity

Decreased muscle fatigue





Through
Medical Thermal Imaging, also known as Thermography, we were able to perform
preliminary tests on the effects of our living activewear on the human body. We

<h3></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span>My Story</span></h3>
<br/><p>My name is Levi Wampler and I have been in love with the martial arts since I was a little kid.  Being a martial arts instructor was the first job I ever wanted to do but over the years my dream has been almost killed by adulthood and responsibilities.  I have been able to keep the dream somewhat alive by running a small part time class wherever I can find space to teach. I currently run a class out of a local gym but I am looking to expand into my own location.  My students need a school they can call home.  </p>
<p>I love training people in martial arts.  Martial arts training is a fun way to get into shape, learn fear management skills, willpower and discipline.  I want to help people in my local community find a fun way to do all of those things and to help them find the courage to follow their own dreams.  </p>
<p>Martial arts training is about more than just defending yourself, or fighting, it is a path of self discovery.  A discovery of the power our bodies and minds are capable of if we push ourselves.  Leading people to the limits of their abilities and then showing them how to dig down and surpass them is one of my greatest pleasures in life.  </p>
<p>I live to help people become stronger, more confident, better versions of themselves.</p>
<br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What I Need To Make It Happen</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Starting a martial arts school doesn’t require very much capital since the main product is my knowledge and time but there are some expenses I will need help with initially.  </p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Fixed Expenses:</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I need three months worth of these expenses to give me a cushion while I build my student base.  </p>
<p><b>Monthly Expenses:</b></p>
<p><b>Rent </b>- $1000 a month  x 3 = $3000</p>
<p><b>Utilities </b>- $200 x 3= $600</p>
<p><b>Marketing Consulting</b> - $200 x 3 = $600</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>One Time Expenses:</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These are expenses I will need to open the doors and attract new students.  I will need enough training equipment for 5 students, after that I will buy more equipment as I add more students.</p>
<b>Open House Advertising </b>- $300</span></span><div>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/><p><b>Insurance (yearly) </b>- $450</p>
<p><b>Training Mats </b>- $1,600</p>
<p><b>Signage </b>- $500</p>
<p><b>Last months rent and Security Deposit for building </b>- $2,000</p>
<p><b>Loaner Gloves and Equipment for new students -</b> $100</p>
<p><b>Punching Bags</b> - $800</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Sub Total</b> - 9,950</p>
<br/><br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">If I Miss The Goal</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I teach my students there are often bumps in the road on the way to your goals. You should never think of these as failures, just setbacks.  They are a chance to show the world how badly you wanted to achieve your goal. If my project does not become fully funded I will work with the funds I receive to make the dream happen.  The building and advertising to get people in the door are my first priorities.  I can slowly purchase everything else I need as I add more students. </p>

</div></div>","My Story
My name is Levi Wampler and I have been in love with the martial arts since I was a little kid.  Being a martial arts instructor was the first job I ever wanted to do but over the years my dream has been almost killed by adulthood and responsibilities.  I have been able to keep the dream somewhat alive by running a small part time class wherever I can find space to teach. I currently run a class out of a local gym but I am looking to expand into my own location.  My students need a school they can call home.  
I love training people in martial arts.  Martial arts training is a fun way to get into shape, learn fear management skills, willpower and discipline.  I want to help people in my local community find a fun way to do all of those things and to help them find the courage to follow their own dreams.  
Martial arts training is about more than just defending yourself, or fighting, it is a path of self discovery.  A discovery of the power our bodies and minds are capable of if we push ourselves.  Leading people to the limits of their abilities and then showing them how to dig down and surpass them is one of my greatest pleasures in life.  
I live to help people become stronger, more confident, better versions of themselves.
What I Need To Make It Happen

Starting a martial arts school doesn’t require very much capital since the main product is my knowledge and time but there are some expenses I will need help with initially.  

Fixed Expenses:

I need three months worth of these expenses to give me a cushion while I build my student base.  
Monthly Expenses:
Rent - $1000 a month  x 3 = $3000
Utilities - $200 x 3= $600
Marketing Consulting - $200 x 3 = $600

One Time Expenses:

These are expenses I will need to open the doors and attract new students.  I will need enough training equipment for 5 students, after that I will buy more equipment as I add more students.
Open House Advertising - $300
Insurance (yearly) - $450
Training Mats - $1,600
Signage - $500
Last months rent and Security Deposit for building - $2,000
Loaner Gloves and Equipment for new students - $100
Punching Bags - $800

Sub Total - 9,950
If I Miss The Goal

I teach my students there are often bumps in the road on the way to your goals. You should never think of these as failures, just setbacks.  They are a chance to show the world how badly you wanted to achieve your goal. If my project does not become fully funded I will work with the funds I receive to make the dream happen.  The building and advertising to get people in the door are my first priorities.  I can slowly purchase everything else I need as I add more students. 
The Perks:
$10 White Belt
The White belt is your first and most important belt, everything you learn after white belt will build on this level.  
For White Belt Donations: 
You will receive a personal Thank You posted to your facebook page and mine letting the world know how much I appreciate your help.
$15  Orange Belt
The Orange belt is an important mile marker on your way to black belt.  You will begin sparring more and learning to use your techniques at full speed.
For Orange Belt Donations:

You will receive a personal Thank You posted to your facebook page and mine letting the world know how much I appreciate your help.
You will also receive a Thank You Card in the mail
Plus, after the school is finished you will receive a picture of the school, so you can see what your money has built. 

$25 Brown Belt
This is when you begin really training hard and you are beginning to become a force of nature.  
For Brown Belt Donations:

All Previous Perks
Plus, your name will be put on a donor wall which will be prominently displayed in my school so all my future students will know you made this school possible for them.

$50 Blue Belt
The Blue Belt is halfway to your black belt and if you live in the Carbondale, IL area this is an important level for you.  
For Blue Belt Donations:


At this level you will  be signing up for unlimited classes at my new facility for one month.  Regular price for unlimited classes will be $80 per month once the school opens.



You will also be listed as a founding member of my school on the donor wall.  .


$100 Black Belt
Originally a belt became black through years of hard training.  The sweat from training would stain the belt black, that doesn't happen now that we have washing machines and bleach.
For Black Belt Donations:

You will be signing up for  TWO months of unlimited classes at my new facility.  Regular price for 2 months of unlimited classes will be $160 once the school opens.
Plus, you will be locking in this rate for one year. 
You will be listed as a founding member of my school on the donor wall.  

$1,000  Master Level
A master is judged not by his martial arts ability but by his ability to produce masters.  
For Master Level Donations:

You will be signing up for unlimited classes for one year and locking in this reduced rate for life and you will be named as a founding member of my school. 
Plus, for this donation level I will name a martial arts move after you.  You will forever be immortalized as people learn to do the ""Your Name Here"" move.  You will also receive a video demonstrating how to do your signature move, and I will mail you a certificate naming you as an Honorary Master.

<p>The cabinet was a huge challenge, it should be small, waterproof, rugged, with good hydrodynamic, so we have used a 3D software to design it, we have made 4 different prototypes in 3D printers until achieve the desired specs. After that we made a injection mold for mass production.    </p>

A traditional clock cannot be easily watched when you are swimming, so the AQUA 100 design was born to solve this problem.More than counting laps, AQUA 100 allows you to monitor 8 different information:You can enable or disable each one of the 8 functions above and switch from one to another with a simple movement. You can also configure AQUA 100 to switch from one enabled function to another automatically each stroke.  AQUA 100 also records the most important information of your training and you can download it through the USB reader, the recorded information are :

Date 


Start Time 


Training time 


Downtime 


Average Stroke Rate (SR)


Average Distance per Stroke (DPS)


Number of stroke cycles 


Number of laps


Distance


Tech Spec


Battery: CR2450 3V 610mA.h


Autonomy : 600 hours of use (4 years if you swim 3 hours per week)


Memory: 1 Mb (More than 7000 training)


Download Interface: Infra Red

 Detailed Functions




Motion Control
AQUA 100 has only one button, it is used to turn it on, turn it off, enter in configuration mode and reset partial chronometer and distance. All other commands and configurations are done by motion detection, to switch from one enabled information to another, you rotate your wrist twice and quickly.


If you want you can configure an automatic mode were the enabled info changes each stroke.
To scroll options in configuration mode or set the clock time you rotate AQUA-100 to left or right to decrease or increase respectively.






USB reader for PC Interface
AQUA 100 allows you to download your training information into a PC through a USB reader. The reader is an infra-red to USB interface.  

Holder
The holder is a textile accessory used to hold AQUA 100 in the back of your hand, there are several challenges on its design, make it comfortable, generate minimum drag and be easy to wear. 


The standard holder is black, but it will be available in different colors and you will be able to match your holder color with your swimsuit.










Swimsuit options
There are 9 swimsuit options for the $99 perk, all of them are high quality products designed by Fabiola Molina company and made by ACQUOS, a resistant and comfortable material. You can choose between 3 models (Sunkini, Swimsuit or men's suit) and 3 different print colors. We will contact you to know your preference.
       





The Team



Renato Pisani and Ivan Sant'Anna studied electronic engineer together and after graduated they worked in an american company where they start developing electronic devices for customers in 1999. In 2003 they open their own design house and help dozens of companies to develop their projects. Ivan and Renato love sports and outdoor activities as much as they love electronics, so in 2009 they launch their first product as an industry and start to produce navigation instruments for free flight pilots. 
For the development of AQUA 100 Ivan and Renato had invited Fabiola Molina and Diogo Yabe, both professional swimmers with participation in Olympic games, to help define features, test and improve it.
Fabio is an angel investor of the company, he is also swimmer, surfer and physical educator. He has joined the company when AQUA 100 was just an idea.

Alessandro Casella is also an adventure lover and he is specialized in video production so he was invited to be part of the team not only for video production, but also to contribute with the campaign creation.


AQUA 100 in the press

VEJA is the Brazilian's weekly best seller magazine, they wrote an article about the promising startup companies where AQUA 100 was highlighted.



Estado de S.Paulo is one of the best sellers daily newspaper in Brazil, this article was about startup companies that export their product abroad, and Tirante A - Adventure Instruments was highlighted as an example of success on this strategy. 



Prototypes evolution


The AQUA 100 evolution can be seen in the pictures below:


The first idea was to use a negative blue and white display, the first test was done with a market LCD from a medical equipment to test the concept. After that we have done a tool to produce a customized LCD, it became nice, but we discovered this color combination was not good enough for underwater visualization, so, after a optical research we changed it for positive black and green.The under water view became perfect.   




The cabinet was a huge challenge, it should be small, waterproof, rugged, with good hydrodynamic, so we have used a 3D software to design it, we have made 4 different prototypes in 3D printers until achieve the desired specs. After that we made a injection mold for mass production.    






Hardware development is what we do better, the first prototype was done with a cropped PCB in order to test some concepts, after that we made the green one where the majority of the software was developed. The black PCB on the right is not the last one, there is a updated version in the same color



The holder is an important part of the product, the challenges here were to create a part comfortable, easy to wear and generate minimum drag.




As you can see, AQUA 100 has already achieve a full function prototype stage,
it cabinet injection mold is already done, the customized display tool to
produce it in large scale is ready and the hardware is 99% completed. Now we
need your help to finish the holder design, finish some details in software algorithm
and produce it in large scale. Every contribution, no matter how small, will
help us build the community we need to bring AQUA 100 to market.
Help us to make your swim smarter.

If you’re reading this, then that means you’re considering a donation to CTW charity wrestling. Before we go any further - thank you. I’m grateful for your time and attention.
The cause of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is near to my heart, as I know several people who battle CF every day. It’s important that we fund the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Over 30,000 Americans (most of them children) suffer from CF, but that amount of people is not enough to warrant federal funding on CF drug research.
In other words: if we don’t donate money to cystic fibrosis research, the research doesn't happen.

   The Impact 
CTW Charity Wrestling is honored and humbled to name the Greater New Jersey Chapter of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as its charity of choice for the 2015 wrestling season.
The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is the world’s leader in the search for a cure for cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects 30,000 children and adults in the United States (and 70,000 worldwide). CF is a life-threatening condition that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system.
As recently as the 1950s, very few children diagnosed with cystic fibrosis lived to the age of 5. Now, with the assistance of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, more than 45% of those affected by CF are over the age of 18. By 2017, CFF hopes to bring a first-generation cystic fibrosis drug to the marketplace.   Why We Need Your Help Since our goal is to raise money AND awareness through CTW pro wrestling events, corporate sponsors don't get a tax write-off for helping sponsor us. As a result, it's been a challenge finding a ""big"" sponsor for the debut event. I'm confident we'll get there, but in the meantime we need as much help as we can from the community.
