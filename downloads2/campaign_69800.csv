<h3>The Future of Tsunami Books:</h3>
<p><strong>Tsunami Books has been at 2585 Willamette Street in beautiful South Eugene for 21 years. </strong>Tsunami has often been called “an Institution”; certainly the 3500+ events we’ve hosted, all surrounded by books shelved on precious recycled lumber, have created an exquisite patina,   <strong>“A big umbrella for the arts, and the human heart."" </strong> Last year at this time we signed a two-year lease-extension after completing a Crowd-funding Campaign (take a look at last year's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3K5tdX1cOPE&amp;nbsp;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crowdfunding video</a> we produced. The truth remains the truth) that allowed us to cover a part of the increased costs of keeping this working-class bookstore alive and healthy. Recently we were informed that sometime soon after July 1, 2017 there are plans to level this building, tentatively replacing it with a two-story retail building, with rent at approximately double the present rate.</p>
<p>This news saddens a lot of good people.<strong> Regardless, for now, we simply must do everything possible to thrive. </strong> One thing is absolutely certain:  the retail sales, the events, the hearts touching hearts--between now and July 1, 2017 need to be the best ever here at the Bookstore. If they are, opportunities for a future life may likely materialize.  <strong>Not to go out in a blaze of glory, but to continue the blaze of glory, and see where it leads.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks!  </p>

The Future of Tsunami Books:
Tsunami Books has been at 2585 Willamette Street in beautiful South Eugene for 21 years. Tsunami has often been called “an Institution”; certainly the 3500+ events we’ve hosted, all surrounded by books shelved on precious recycled lumber, have created an exquisite patina,   “A big umbrella for the arts, and the human heart.""  Last year at this time we signed a two-year lease-extension after completing a Crowd-funding Campaign (take a look at last year's crowdfunding video we produced. The truth remains the truth) that allowed us to cover a part of the increased costs of keeping this working-class bookstore alive and healthy. Recently we were informed that sometime soon after July 1, 2017 there are plans to level this building, tentatively replacing it with a two-story retail building, with rent at approximately double the present rate.
This news saddens a lot of good people. Regardless, for now, we simply must do everything possible to thrive.  One thing is absolutely certain:  the retail sales, the events, the hearts touching hearts--between now and July 1, 2017 need to be the best ever here at the Bookstore. If they are, opportunities for a future life may likely materialize.  Not to go out in a blaze of glory, but to continue the blaze of glory, and see where it leads.
Thanks!

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><i>By owner, Christine Brenner</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484454402/kro1bqzf0ztzdde873ru.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;padding:10px;""/></p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have loved words and the beauty and power they hold. Whether it was poems, short stories or diary entries, I was always writing and absorbing every book I could get my hands on as a child. But my first “true love” moment happened when my fourth-grade teacher gave me <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> by C.S. Lewis. I fell in love with the language, the story and the adventurous hero, Lucy, who was the same age I was. <i>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</i> helped to break down the barriers and limitations in my head as a young girl and made me unafraid to open new doors.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have teachers who inspired me and to have a family that valued reading and always made sure I had access to books. My early experiences with literacy helped to shape my career and my life, first as a teacher, then a school librarian, then a stay-at-home mom and now the owner of a children’s bookstore.  I want to share my passion for children’s literature and the importance of early literacy. I envision <strong>Read With Me, A Children’s Book &amp; Art Shop</strong> as a place where everyone is welcome and where visitors feel inspired to meet a new friend — real or imagined.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484453399/gsgqjzm7gp2g6y3hqxth.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Clifford showing me some love</i></p>
<h2>About Read With Me</h2>
<p><strong>Read With Me</strong> was conceived because we saw the need for a place in downtown for families to experience together. <strong>Read With Me</strong> will be a place for us all to share our love of children’s books — a place where you can find a great book to read, join a book club or be inspired to write your own story in our workshop space. In picture books and graphic novels, illustrations are vital to storytelling. <strong>Read With Me</strong> will have an exhibit featuring illustrators and host illustration classes. We will celebrate all things related to the art of creating and sharing stories.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484455579/p3frzemnp6uksyqymx8l.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The family outside of Read With Me</i></p>
<p>We are all well aware of the importance of literacy for a child’s academic success. Our name, <strong>Read With Me</strong>, highlights the No. 1 way to encourage your child to value reading: by reading “with” rather than “to” your child. Reading should be a shared, engaging experience between adult and child that is an open interaction of sharing thoughts and asking questions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484457287/mub0lwqhqnubndjpetyg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Reading with Dad (4 months; 5 years) </i></p>
<p>Above all, reading should be fun. Yet I understand that, at times, it can feel like a chore. The best way to make it fun is to read books that you find enjoyable, and not everyone has the time to find those perfect books. At <strong>Read With Me</strong>, we sift through the thousands of children’s books published each year and carefully curate a diverse collection that kids will love and parents will love to read with them. When kids see us enjoying reading, they will internalize a love for reading also.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>You may have heard some bleak reports about the future of printed books and physical bookstores over the past several years. The triple threat of e-books, Amazon sales and the recession certainly hit the book market hard. However, printed books have proven they are here to stay, especially with children. The children’s book market has grown to a third of the entire book market. And people all over the country are realizing the power of shopping local and importance of supporting small businesses. New bookstores are opening, and the survivors are thriving!</p>
<p>All new business ventures have obstacles. Here are some of ours:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cost to open</strong>: Opening a new retail store is an expensive venture, but we have a very thorough expense report and projections. Margins are low and profits are slow for books. But with the help of this campaign and owner financing we will open!</li>
<li>
<strong>How to shine</strong>: With many places to buy children’s books and with thousands of children’s books published each year, we have to reflect a special glow. <strong>Read With Me</strong> will carefully curate a collection of the best children’s books that your kids will love and you will love to read with them. Our Creativity Corner workshop space will inspire your budding writer or illustrator. And our book clubs for kids and adults will connect you with new and fictional friends.</li>
<li>
<strong>To prosper and grow</strong>: Raleigh is experiencing impressive growth, and we want to grow along with it. In order to make sure <strong>Read With Me</strong> is here for the long term, we will focus on smart marketing to find our customers and stay connected. <strong>Read With Me</strong> will actively seek and value customer input and feedback.

By owner, Christine Brenner

For as long as I can remember, I have loved words and the beauty and power they hold. Whether it was poems, short stories or diary entries, I was always writing and absorbing every book I could get my hands on as a child. But my first “true love” moment happened when my fourth-grade teacher gave me The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis. I fell in love with the language, the story and the adventurous hero, Lucy, who was the same age I was. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe helped to break down the barriers and limitations in my head as a young girl and made me unafraid to open new doors.
I was fortunate to have teachers who inspired me and to have a family that valued reading and always made sure I had access to books. My early experiences with literacy helped to shape my career and my life, first as a teacher, then a school librarian, then a stay-at-home mom and now the owner of a children’s bookstore.  I want to share my passion for children’s literature and the importance of early literacy. I envision Read With Me, A Children’s Book & Art Shop as a place where everyone is welcome and where visitors feel inspired to meet a new friend — real or imagined.

Clifford showing me some love
About Read With Me
Read With Me was conceived because we saw the need for a place in downtown for families to experience together. Read With Me will be a place for us all to share our love of children’s books — a place where you can find a great book to read, join a book club or be inspired to write your own story in our workshop space. In picture books and graphic novels, illustrations are vital to storytelling. Read With Me will have an exhibit featuring illustrators and host illustration classes. We will celebrate all things related to the art of creating and sharing stories.

The family outside of Read With Me
We are all well aware of the importance of literacy for a child’s academic success. Our name, Read With Me, highlights the No. 1 way to encourage your child to value reading: by reading “with” rather than “to” your child. Reading should be a shared, engaging experience between adult and child that is an open interaction of sharing thoughts and asking questions.

Reading with Dad (4 months; 5 years) 
Above all, reading should be fun. Yet I understand that, at times, it can feel like a chore. The best way to make it fun is to read books that you find enjoyable, and not everyone has the time to find those perfect books. At Read With Me, we sift through the thousands of children’s books published each year and carefully curate a diverse collection that kids will love and parents will love to read with them. When kids see us enjoying reading, they will internalize a love for reading also.


Reading under the covers; Reading with a friend

<p>We met 12 years ago while caring for an elderly man who lived to be 92. After 7 years of working together for Bob, he passed, and we wondered what to do next. We both care about people and the state of the world, and we wanted to make a difference in peoples’ lives. Both of us had realized that we all have the power to create with our choices, actions, hands, hearts and minds. We sought out an outlet to empower and inspire others to become master creators in their own lives.  We believe that a healthier world can be created one handcraft at a time.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">An Unexpected Opportunity</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>We said yes when asked if we wanted to take over a small existing yarn shop, and although we’ve always had a grand vision, we didn’t expect the need to grow so rapidly. Soon after our first year in business, everyone in our building was given 3 months notice. We weren’t quite ready to expand, so we took a moment and asked ourselves - do we change or end? Our locals encouraged us to move forward because in our short life, the shop had already become a vital thread in the community.</p>
<p>…. and then we found the perfect location.</p>

</div></div>","We are Kerri and Numahka.     
                                     Kerri Hartman                                    Numahka Swan
Kerri is a natural hostess and net worker. She is friendly, engaging, and passionate about the mental health benefits of slowing down to learn a handcraft. She is an avid, skilled knitter, and is all about exceptional customer service.
Numahka is the reason people gasp when they open our doors. Her vision creates the flavor of our emporium. She’s the bookkeeper, ask her anything about the shop, and she will pull the file. She is also the reason our website is full of life. Numahka’s home, and by extension our shop, is where many of the teenagers in town come for a word of encouragement, and a place to feel at home.

We met 12 years ago while caring for an elderly man who lived to be 92. After 7 years of working together for Bob, he passed, and we wondered what to do next. We both care about people and the state of the world, and we wanted to make a difference in peoples’ lives. Both of us had realized that we all have the power to create with our choices, actions, hands, hearts and minds. We sought out an outlet to empower and inspire others to become master creators in their own lives.  We believe that a healthier world can be created one handcraft at a time.
An Unexpected Opportunity
 
We said yes when asked if we wanted to take over a small existing yarn shop, and although we’ve always had a grand vision, we didn’t expect the need to grow so rapidly. Soon after our first year in business, everyone in our building was given 3 months notice. We weren’t quite ready to expand, so we took a moment and asked ourselves - do we change or end? Our locals encouraged us to move forward because in our short life, the shop had already become a vital thread in the community.
…. and then we found the perfect location.
                                                                                            
                      First days at the new location.            Filling the space.
                                                       

Our veranda then.
Our Mission
Our vision has always included supporting people who seek to make a living through their craft - whatever their craft may be. We’ve collaborated with artists from every aspect of the fiber industry, as well as potters, metal and wood workers, animators, and musicians.
Our mission includes changing the way commerce works by shortening the gap between product and customer. Buying locally is not just good for the economy, it also benefits the environment and connects us to our neighbors in a meaningful way.
What Bazaar Girls Yarn Shop offers that sets us apart is the space itself. Not the building, but the space we have created to hold the Marketplace, the Classroom, the Retreat, and Community Outreach. 
A Crafting Community, crafting community.
What we have done and are doing.



Our Shop.

Children's corner.

A collection of hand dyed yarn & fiber.

Examples of other locally made items we sell.

Getaway Retreat 2017
 
Our shop fulfills needs that are bigger than either of us alone. Bazaar Girls and boys everywhere have come out of the woodwork to join in on this crafting revolution. We are at another precipice, and we find ourselves asking once again: Change or end?
The demand for our goods, the space, and classes is expanding so rapidly that we cannot maintain it on our own. In order to grow to meet the demand, it is vital that we bring in more people to help maintain and fine tune our systems, as well as make the push to bring the next phase of our vision into fruition.
 
Sustainable Growth & The Grander Vision
What we want to do.
A $100,000 will give us the start up capital to set up systems in all three major areas of our business. Once set up, these systems will grow and be able to sustain themselves.

The initial main goals for our Marketplace are:

To purchase and set up a POS system which will save us time and money by helping us manage and replace our inventory more accurately and efficiently.
Add the yarn lines from 6 of our most loved & 'unique to us' companies to our on-line store. We know these yarns will sell and these small companies will be given a substantial boost from our initial purchases. We'll reinvest the money from the yarn sales to replace inventory and to continue to add companies to our on-line store.

$57,500 invested in our Marketplace would be used as follows:

$1200 for our POS system.
$1000 to pay for help in adding our inventory to new system.
$8000 for 8 weeks of photographing, editing, and adding inventory to on-line store.
$47,300 to purchase inventory and rent a small heated space to store it.


 The initial main goals for our Classroom are:
Our beautiful classroom has never met its full potential. Doing so would require the focused attention of an employee who thrives on community outreach and is not involved with the daily workings of the shop.
$15,000 invested in our Classroom would be used as follows:

$10,000 to hire a part time Classroom Coordinator - up to 68 hours a month for a year with the objective being, that at the end of the year the classroom would begin to pay for itself, and we will be able to keep the Coordinator on staff.
$2500 for advertising, printing and other promotional costs.
$2500 for website maintenance, updating, and continued development.

If we go beyond our $100,000 goal, we will immediately begin the process of turning our classroom into a nonprofit. 

 
The initial main goals for our Retreats are:

Raise enough money to pay for our 'Getaway Retreat' in April 2018, and save the money brought in from this retreat to pay for the next one. As word spreads about how fun these are, and they grow, we will expand to two retreats a year.
Develop our 'Build your own Retreat' for individual groups throughout the year.

$27,500 invested in our Retreats would be used as follows:

$25,000 for 'Getaway Retreat'
$8154 - Teachers: includes teaching fees, travel, a place to stay, and some meals.
$2534 - Marketing: The more people we reach, the more people will sign up!
$4500 - Event Coordinator: She is invaluable in making our retreat run smoothly. She handles the details.
$4360 - Classrooms & event rooms at the Maritime Center
$3500 -  Caterer
$1452 Goody Bag Fillers and Door Prizes
$500 Bags
$2500 for development of 'Build Your Own Retreat'
$2500 for web development. We want people to be able to customize their retreat on-line.

Now after becoming an aunt to 11 nephews and nieces (and still counting!), as well as working for some of the world's top childrenswear stores, Rosie decided to set up Roses and the Stars, an online store selling gorgeous gifts for babies and their wonderful mums, a long-held dream and ambition.Inspired by her own childhood in the English countryside, Rosie sources products which are reminiscent of the simpler childhood of times gone by, whether that be sourcing handmade teddy bears from the last remaining manufacturer in the UK, or creating clothing collections of classic designs, made of Liberty Print heritage fabrics.Most importantly our products are sourced from sustainable sources and are produced by fair trade factories, cottage industry artisans or are made using items otherwise headed for the dump. At Roses and the Stars, we believe that the most important gift you can give a child is a future filled with hope where our responsibility to the Earth and it's people are taken seriously and are protected.The 'doors' to our online store opened in September 2016 and now we are looking to build upon our initial success by popping up at as many events, markets and fairs as possible, so we can meet our customers and introduce them to the beautiful brands and services we provide through the website.How Can You Help Us?Firstly and most importantly we encourage you to share our story in any way you can, whether that be through social media or through chatting about our shop with others at the school gates. We know that it is not always possible to donate to these campaigns, even if you'd like to, but the power of word of mouth is truly amazing so we hope that you'll be able to do this even if you're unable to help in any other way.Of course, we'd be delighted with any donations you can give to our cause! A full list of our donation gifts are on the side and explained below.£20 - We will send you a personalised hand written thank you card with some branded stickers so you can help spread the word even further and be forever reminded of your good deed!

<h3>Veteran Owned Small Business</h3>
<p>My name is David Qualls, and I am a Disabled Iraqi Freedom Veteran, I have spent over half  my life in the US Army, and now am attempting running a small CNC and Design Business.</p>
<p>My livelihood depends on my machines, the roof over my family's' heads, the food on our table, the heat in the winter.  They all depend on my ability to produce items in my shop with the machines; without which, we cannot pay our bills.  </p>
<p>The CNC Machine I use, is home made, and has served me well for quite a  few years, but as with many home made items, it has met it's shelf life.  The laser, was constructed using plans from Instructables, and has reached the end of it's life.</p>
<p>Your $10 or more contribution combined with the generosity of others, will allow me to purchase a new Laser Cutter.  I am not asking for a handout, but a hand up.  Your $10 will buy you a professionally made name plate for your desk, or your door.  These plates are much more expensive at your local trophy shop.  I use only the finest quality materials, and make sure that any work that comes from my shop is 100% professional and perfect.  If my name goes on it, you know the quality is second to none.</p>
<p>If you choose to make a larger donation, of course the product you are purchasing becomes larger.  With a CNC Laser, I can produce just about anything, if you can find a picture on Google Images, I can engrave it for you.  I use a mix of Corian, Acrylic, Wood, and High Density Urethane Foam.  The quality of the substrate is key to a professional product.</p>
<p>I have a choice of two quality industrial cutters. the AKJ6040 Laser which is an 80 watt laser, with a total working area of 600*400mm, that equals about 23 x 15 inch actual cutting area, for a list price of 2750.00, or the AKJ6080 Laser which is also an 80 watt laser, it just has a larger 600*900 or  23 x 35 inch working area, for 2950.00.</p>
<p>WHAT'S IN IF FOR YOU?</p>
<p>I can think of no better Christmas presents than personalized gifts.  I can engrave on stemware, Mugs and Drinking Glasses, Jewelry, Wooden Toys, Kitchenware, Tools, even customized iPhone and iPad cases, the list is infinite.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once again, without help to purchase a new machine, my business and income will be gone, every dime I get will go toward the purchase of the new equipment. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Unable to give?</h3>
<p>I understand times are tough, I am living proof of that.  But do not give up hope, you can help by spreading the word, maybe there is someone out there needing  a tax write off, it is that time of the year, or there is someone who is just feeling generous.  </p>
<p>Let everyone know  a Disabled Army Veteran needs a hand up.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this, I hope I have convinced you that I am a hard working person who has fallen on a bit of bad luck, and I will continue to be a hard working person, one way or another.</p>

<h3><strong>Why One Crust™?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>NOURISHMENT</strong>: The food that you eat is the most divine and basic self-care. We are providing high vibing food that will ENERGIZE you and help your body remain in harmony.</p>
<p><strong>CREATIVITY</strong>: This crust is a blank canvas for your culinary creation! The process of preparing food promotes mindfulness, imagination, and bliss. We get you started, but ultimately you’re going to choose the fresh organic toppings to really bring this to life and design your own meal.</p>
<p><strong>GIVING</strong>: Every crust is going to give back 10% to charities which benefit at-risk women and girls. YAY! We believe that determined women can become powerful agents of societal transformation within their communities when they are supported by strong ethical businesses, and we will build One Crust™ around giving back.  </p>
<p><strong>Cauliflower crust is absolutely scrumptious and super good for you (less than 4 net carbs and only 207 calories per serving) but it is also difficult and time-consuming to prepare. With One Crust™ we take care of  the hard part and lovingly prepare your cauliflower crust, then you get a nourishing blank canvas for creating a superb meal! </strong></p>
<p>Customers of our little conscious company in New Hampshire LOVE this crust, but we NEED YOUR HELP to bring it outside our local delivery area and EVERYWHERE IN THE US!</p>
<p>BE ONE OF THE FIRST to try our high vibing flavorful VEGAN, PALEO, KETO, and GLUTEN FREE crust, then add your toppings and create the meal that YOU want, according to the way YOU eat.</p>
<p>Inspired by the passionate food communities that made our meal delivery business a success, One Crust™ is the star of your real food pizza party! Whether you’re vegan, paleo, keto, don’t eat gluten, don’t eat dairy, don’t eat GMO’s or just don’t eat anything that isn’t super yummy and satisfying…you will LOVE this crust! It is TRULY ‘One Crust’ for ALL. (oh and by the way, WE LOVE YOU!)</p>

<h3>The 'ALL REAL' Movement + Conscious Entrepreneurship</h3>
<p>We like to say, One Crust™ is for ALL OUR FELLOW HUMANS. Because everyone needs to eat. Right? Food is SOOOO IMPORTANT, and providing incredibly tasty fare, made of the best raw ingredients on earth is WHAT WE DO! We’ve been doing it for three years, and every day we hear from our customers how eating REAL is changing their lives.</p>
<p>With All Real Meal, we've committed to giving back to our local food bank, worthy charities, and nonprofits, from day one!  Even before we were making a profit, we found ways to use our little conscious company to give back. (PURE JOY!) We want to replicate what we've done so far, and use One Crust™ as a vehicle to give generously, and encourage others to do the same.</p>

<p>This isn't just about pizza. One Crust™ is about conscious eating AND conscious giving. How many people (or animals, trees, etc) will benefit when you purchase this pizza? The sky’s the limit! The more responsibly sourced vegan food (that is universally appealing) we can bring to the market, the better it is for the WHOLE PLANET. And our long-term vision is to help MILLIONS of people eat like they love themselves! Because when you EAT CONSCIOUSLY it trickles down into everything else you do and MAKES YOU BETTER. </p>
</div>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>The next 3 months: In the 90 days following the close of the campaign we will continue securing the freshest naturally grown cauliflower, secure responsibly sourced packaging, and work with a local university to ensure crusts are preserved and super fresh upon delivery. We will hire a new team member or two to help us execute this launch flawlessly. We will create an effective packaging and shipping process, and Indiegogo pre-orders and perks will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The next 12 months: In the next twelve months we will secure large-scale orders for our crust with local and nationwide grocery stores. We won't sleep until this happens! We will donate proceeds from the sale of One Crust™ as well as continue to research how to positively impact both our local and global community. </p>
<p>The next 3 years: In the next three years we plan to expand beyond pizza crust and create similar All Real Meal™ products which follow the same formula: scrumptious, plant-based, grain free, high energy, and nutrient dense.  We are already experimenting with zucchini, spaghetti squash and sweet potatoes! We will continue to expand our ‘first to market’ creations and distribute with a commitment to provide funding to important charities, to source ingredients from small non-commercial farms, and to provide an envied and ethical work culture for our staff.</p>

<h3>Current Progress</h3>
<p>We have put a great deal of work into this project already, but WE NEED YOUR HELP TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. We have the recipe perfected, the eco-packaging picked out, and our beautiful and fully licensed kitchen secured. In addition, we have had the crust available to our local meal delivery customers for several months. This has given us the opportunity to get loads of feedback and tweak the recipe a couple of times for optimum deliciousness. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's ALWAYS a risk to start a new food business, and with this new direction will come new demands. We feel qualified to take on this challenge. </p>
<p>Here's why:</p>
<p>All Real Meal™ started out as nothing more than an idea. The idea was that moms like us needed an affordable and convenient option for beautiful, non-GMO, fully cooked, meals delivered to your home. We had no culinary training, no funding, six children, husbands and day jobs to juggle while getting our company off the ground in an industry where most businesses fail. Three years later we've created an award-winning sustainable business that is debt free, gives back considerably to our local community and inspires conscious eating. How did we do it? We FELL IN LOVE with the demanding, exciting, educational, philanthropic life of entrepreneurship. Real food is our passion, but our MISSION is building a good-for-the-planet company in alignment with our values, unique gifts, and vision. One Crust™ is the next step! </p>
<p>Your backing our campaign will provide us the capital to purchase responsibly sourced ingredients, to hire some more helpers and provide a proper wage, workman’s comp and insurance for said helpers, purchase packaging, pay for the testing necessary to provide accurate nutritional info, certifications for packaging, and to expand our web and e-commerce platform. In addition, it will help us to get professional assistance with accounting and legally protecting our company.</p>

<h3>GET HOOKED UP!</h3>
<p>As a thank you for backing our campaign, we're rolling out loads of fun perks! Be the first to get hooked up with One Crust™ and snag some 'REAL FOOD'  gear.  We have tees, tanks, aprons and bumper stickers, depending on your level of support.

Inspired by this campaign, we're even putting together an exclusive cookbook chock full of inspired recipes from our REAL FOOD kitchen. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We could really use some help to spread the word about All Real Meal™ and One Crust™. There are still a lot of people in the state and our local region who don’t know there’s a New Hampshire company making gluten free, mostly organic, locally sourced meals, desserts, and cauliflower pizza crust that can be delivered right to your door.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in finding out more information about All Real Meal we’re super easy to find online. If you type “real food New Hampshire” into google, we're the first to come up! We have been featured on <strong>NHPR</strong>, <strong>Business NH Magazine</strong>, <strong>New Hampshire Magazine</strong>, <strong>The Hippo</strong>, and more. </p>
<p>Like 'allrealmeal' on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for campaign updates. Better yet, come visit us in our commercial kitchen in Derry!  We’re so proud of it, and we love to show it off.</p>
<p>Thank you for purchasing, eating, cooking, and sharing our pizza crust and for your continued support. And thank you to all of our All Real Meal™ customers who have helped us get this far. We absolutely wouldn't be here without you! </p>

We will hire a new team member or two to help us execute this launch flawlessly. We will create an effective packaging and shipping process, and Indiegogo pre-orders and perks will be fulfilled.
The next 12 months: In the next twelve months we will secure large-scale orders for our crust with local and nationwide grocery stores. We won't sleep until this happens! We will donate proceeds from the sale of One Crust™ as well as continue to research how to positively impact both our local and global community. 
The next 3 years: In the next three years we plan to expand beyond pizza crust and create similar All Real Meal™ products which follow the same formula: scrumptious, plant-based, grain free, high energy, and nutrient dense.  We are already experimenting with zucchini, spaghetti squash and sweet potatoes! We will continue to expand our ‘first to market’ creations and distribute with a commitment to provide funding to important charities, to source ingredients from small non-commercial farms, and to provide an envied and ethical work culture for our staff.

Current Progress
We have put a great deal of work into this project already, but WE NEED YOUR HELP TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP. We have the recipe perfected, the eco-packaging picked out, and our beautiful and fully licensed kitchen secured. In addition, we have had the crust available to our local meal delivery customers for several months. This has given us the opportunity to get loads of feedback and tweak the recipe a couple of times for optimum deliciousness. 

Risks & Challenges
It's ALWAYS a risk to start a new food business, and with this new direction will come new demands. We feel qualified to take on this challenge. 
Here's why:
All Real Meal™ started out as nothing more than an idea. The idea was that moms like us needed an affordable and convenient option for beautiful, non-GMO, fully cooked, meals delivered to your home. We had no culinary training, no funding, six children, husbands and day jobs to juggle while getting our company off the ground in an industry where most businesses fail. Three years later we've created an award-winning sustainable business that is debt free, gives back considerably to our local community and inspires conscious eating. How did we do it? We FELL IN LOVE with the demanding, exciting, educational, philanthropic life of entrepreneurship. Real food is our passion, but our MISSION is building a good-for-the-planet company in alignment with our values, unique gifts, and vision. One Crust™ is the next step! 
Your backing our campaign will provide us the capital to purchase responsibly sourced ingredients, to hire some more helpers and provide a proper wage, workman’s comp and insurance for said helpers, purchase packaging, pay for the testing necessary to provide accurate nutritional info, certifications for packaging, and to expand our web and e-commerce platform. In addition, it will help us to get professional assistance with accounting and legally protecting our company.

GET HOOKED UP!
As a thank you for backing our campaign, we're rolling out loads of fun perks! Be the first to get hooked up with One Crust™ and snag some 'REAL FOOD'  gear.  We have tees, tanks, aprons and bumper stickers, depending on your level of support. There are All Real Meal™ coupons for locals and shipped One Crust™ for those of you further away. Inspired by this campaign, we're even putting together an exclusive cookbook chock full of inspired recipes from our REAL FOOD kitchen. 

 

Other Ways You Can Help
We could really use some help to spread the word about All Real Meal™ and One Crust™. There are still a lot of people in the state and our local region who don’t know there’s a New Hampshire company making gluten free, mostly organic, locally sourced meals, desserts, and cauliflower pizza crust that can be delivered right to your door.
If you’re interested in finding out more information about All Real Meal we’re super easy to find online. If you type “real food New Hampshire” into google, we're the first to come up! We have been featured on NHPR, Business NH Magazine, New Hampshire Magazine, The Hippo, and more. 
Like 'allrealmeal' on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for campaign updates. Better yet, come visit us in our commercial kitchen in Derry!  We’re so proud of it, and we love to show it off.
Thank you for purchasing, eating, cooking, and sharing our pizza crust and for your continued support. And thank you to all of our All Real Meal™ customers who have helped us get this far. We absolutely wouldn't be here without you!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Is Impact Hub Harare All About</h3>
<p>So you’ve heard all the stories about Zimbabwe, right? Bond notes... The ridiculously high inflation from the years passed…and the unstable political situation of course. Not to mention all of the usual chatter about how it was once the bread basket of Africa and became a basket-case just a couple of decades later.</p>
<p>Well…this is a different story. This is one about the people and the incredible resilience they have. It’s about their creativity, their drive and their passion. It’s about a small group of Zimbabweans who see the negative headlines as a call to action. For this group the status quo is no longer a comfort zone but a burden.</p>
<p>Impact Hub Harare is the oasis. This is where the change-makers of Zimbabwe are coming together to build the entrepreneurial ecosystem from the ground up. However, in order for that to happen Impact Hub needs a little nudge to kick it into the gear of sustainability.</p>
<p>Help us to launch Impact Hub Harare!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do We Need The Money </h3>
<p>We need your help to ""hack the hub"". We will use the money to find a new and unique space for social entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and changemakers to get the support they need to get their initiative to the next level. We plan to make sure that everyone in Zimbabwe hears about the hub and knows that they can go there if they want to make a difference. We will be visiting the highlands and lowlands of the country to see what the change-makers of Zimbabwe need and how the hub can help them to achieve their goals. </p>

<h3>About Spendefy: </h3>
<p>Spendefy is an Atlanta-based tech company founded by Antwon Davis and Eldredge E. Washington. We’ve built a platform to leverage the power of consumerism for economic and social good. After observing the ongoing lack of support for black-owned businesses in Atlanta and around the country, our team began to erect a plan to build solidarity between black-owned businesses and conscious consumers. We believe supporting local black-owned businesses is one way we can all contribute to making our communities better. We believe Spendefy will bring awareness and exposure for amazing black-owned businesses around the US.</p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3>
<p>Since January 1, 2016, Spendefy has been able to help thousands of people discover, connect and support amazing black-owned businesses in their city. Although we have been recognized on several national platforms - including, but not limited to, CNN, Black Enterprise, Ebony, Rolling Out Magazine, and many more - we are still only available in Georgia and New York. In order for us to go to the next level and truly begin to make an economic impact in our community, we must expand immediately. </p>
<p>As a black-owned tech startup, much like many black-owned businesses, it has been a challenge to gain capital/funding. We are asking you if you would like to be part of the collective to help us succeed the same way we want all black businesses to succeed. $55,000 will not only help us expand nationwide, but it will also help us finalize and release our app. The app will be released on the iPhone first and then Android.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480030523/f7iwcwxcqaoqbuwj852v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two of the biggest requests we receive every day from business owners and consumers are:</p>
<p><strong>#1. When will the Spendefy App launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>#2. When will Spendefy be nationwide?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we are officially prepared to make both of those requests happen in 2017. But we cannot do it without YOUR help! We are crowdfunding to develop and launch our app, and to expand Spendefy to cities across America.</p>

<h3>What Happens When We Win?</h3>
<p>Once we reach our goal, the wait will finally be over!  No longer will you have to struggle to find black-owned businesses in your city. We are going to create technology that will bridge the gap and connect local black-owned businesses to consumers all over America. Starting February 2017, we will launch our new app and make Spendefy available in a new state every month. This cannot happen without your contribution. You can see what cities we will be expanding to in 2017 below. </p>

<h3>N1 Tours, your ticket to adventure</h3>
<p>N1 Tours is a new business, that wishes to stay debt free, therefore crowdfunding is an approach, to help fund a vehicle to start with. N1 Tours are keeping the everyday Joe, who has his own little corner in the tourism industry, in mind to support them as well, and the goal is to</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Jobs in a country with a very high unemployment rate.</li>
<li>Support other small businesses linked to the tourism industry.</li>
<li>To give tourists a chance to cost effectively experience this wonderful country.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, we need a new vehicle, that is trustworthy and robust to meet the needs of the<br/>business, and to give the tourist an experience they never will forget.</li>
<li>We need $80,000.00 to obtain this vehicle and fit it out with the necessary equipment. </li>
<li>We have perks to die for, from photo journals of our maiden voyage, which we want to<br/>kick off in the new year, to souvenirs for mid-high perks and huge discounts to a holiday, and a raffle winner to get a South African holiday free! Please note, that this covers only the South African tours and excludes all airfares, airport taxes to and from South Africa, but your journey will start at the airport.</li>
<li>There is a possibility of the target not being met, but the funds will still be used to grow the<br/>business and to support local small businesses linked to the tourism of South Africa to help them grow. And we will still continue to rent the vehicles we need.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are looking into the support structure of other small businesses and startups:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new startups and small businesses in the tourism will get firs priority, giving them a chance to grow, but quality will not be sacrificed, instead, if we see the quality is not to the standard we will focus on helping that business to raise the standards.</li>
<li>Your contribution will not go to waist. If the target has not been met, we will rather<br/>use the funds to help other small businesses to grow and improve. Constant updates will be posted.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>!!!COMPANIES WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE!!!</h3>
<p>Not everyone wants or can partake what other perks have to offer, and you still want something<br/>in return. What companies can use the most is exposure. What a great way to contribute, and to<br/>receive returns on their investments,<br/><br/>In short, we will make sure that your branding would be visible in our videos and photos we take, there will always be a sponsored section in our newsletters, website, youtube and all of the social media available to use.<br/><br/>The two things we would need from you is your contribution, and your media you would want to use in this fashion, in electronic form. We will  take care of the rest.</p>
<p>This is a great way to help start an opportunity in an open market here in South Africa and reap the benefit of the kind of exposure you need as well. This is not just for N1 Tours, but for each and every person who have started in the tourist industry whose bussiness will be seeked out to help them grow as well. This also creates a platform for budget tours with good quality and an experience you will never forget.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So you have come to this page and you have no means to help fund, but you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word, share the links to your Facebook, Twitter and ask them to spread the word as well.</li>
<li>It is best to use the tools that Indiegogo gives you to spread the word.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Final word:</p><p>I hope that this finds you in good spirit and that your heart and generosity is open, to help start something new, and to improve the lives this will touch.</p><p>Thank you very much </p></div>","N1 Tours, your ticket to adventure

The Impact
We are looking into the support structure of other small businesses and startups:

The new startups and small businesses in the tourism will get firs priority, giving them a chance to grow, but quality will not be sacrificed, instead, if we see the quality is not to the standard we will focus on helping that business to raise the standards.
Your contribution will not go to waist. If the target has not been met, we will ratheruse the funds to help other small businesses to grow and improve. Constant updates will be posted.


!!!COMPANIES WHO WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE!!!
Not everyone wants or can partake what other perks have to offer, and you still want somethingin return. What companies can use the most is exposure. What a great way to contribute, and toreceive returns on their investments,In short, we will make sure that your branding would be visible in our videos and photos we take, there will always be a sponsored section in our newsletters, website, youtube and all of the social media available to use.The two things we would need from you is your contribution, and your media you would want to use in this fashion, in electronic form. We will  take care of the rest.
This is a great way to help start an opportunity in an open market here in South Africa and reap the benefit of the kind of exposure you need as well. This is not just for N1 Tours, but for each and every person who have started in the tourist industry whose bussiness will be seeked out to help them grow as well. This also creates a platform for budget tours with good quality and an experience you will never forget.

<p><i>Differentiating Factors</i> – Toastilla strives to promote healthier eating on the go. By allowing you to cook corn tortillas, in your toaster, for taco night, you are left with perfectly heated tortillas with no need for excess fat from cooking in oil and done quicker than it would take you to heat up the pan. With Toastilla your tortillas stand upright in your toaster, keeping their shape, not bending or breaking and Toastilla makes it easy to pull your tortillas out of the toaster without burning your fingers. But, it doesn’t stop there. You can wrap anything in a flour tortilla, execute the classic “Toastilla” fold, lay it on the Toastilla, clamp it shut and pop it in your toaster. Out pops a creation that’s perfectly taught and slightly crispy on the outside with warm, fresh ingredients on the inside. We have compiled a cookbook of some of our favorite recipes so far, ranging from the classic Cheese Toastilla Pocket to a Pizza Toastilla Pocket, Margharita Toastilla Pocket or even a Toastilla Pocket made with Brie Cheese. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><i>Experience</i> – With our team initially consisting of business development and growth experience, as Toastilla’s been put in motion, we have been able to establish a wonderful team across the board for marketing, designing and manufacturing as well. We feel blessed with the team we have established and know that they are a dynamic team that can accomplish great things.</p>
<h2>How Toastilla® Came About...</h2>
<p>The recession forced the 2011 closing of my once thriving landscaping company. We lived on the little savings we had hoping things would turn around. In survival mode things go by the way side, like repairing broken appliances such as a stovetop with only 2 working burners, the small ones at that. Needless to say, each night presented a challenge to cook dinner. One night we were preparing tacos with meat on one burner, beans on another, trying to find room to cook rice while trying to figuring out how to cook the tortillas. I looked over and there was our toaster. So, I plopped in a couple tortillas and they turned out great. Only problem was they fell to the bottom, curling up. Getting them out was difficult and they took on a rather awkward shape for tacos, but I knew I was onto something. That’s when Toastilla was born.</p>

<h2>Risks and challenges:</h2>
<p>While every company has a certain amount of risks, we feel that with our dedication to growing with minimal debt, we minimize the risk of a company that is set-up to fail from the start.

</div></div>","Who Is Toastilla® Designed For...
The Original “Toastilla”: Designed with YOU in mind, to be used as a multipurpose cooking device that utilizes your own toaster to create endless possibilities, Toastilla is what every consumer needs. With its hinged bottom, interlocking handles and sleek design, Toastilla can cook anything from corn tortillas to quesadillas (or as we like to refer to them…Toastilla Pockets), from frozen foods to fresh from the garden peppers and veggies, right in your toaster. When you’re finished, Toastilla stores beautifully on your counter, right in your toaster. Toastilla is made of food grade stainless steel with high temp plastic handles designed to stay cool to the touch, so there’s no need to worry about burning your fingers. Toastilla can also be placed in the dishwasher as needed. Toastilla is light weight and can easily be packed in a bag or suitcase when traveling. Everyone needs a Toastilla.

<p>The Just Be Yoga tribe is an ever-growing community. Everyday we witness the incredible capacity for yoga to touch lives and change the world, and we intend to use everyday as an opportunity for more people to truly <i>live yoga.</i></p>
<p>Within these first three years of being open, we have grown to the point of requiring additional studio space for our evolving community.

<p>Even with the loss of the second studio and the denied claim from the insurance company, we are moving forward with an ever bigger vision and expanding JBY to a new building with incredible potential - and only minutes away from our current home. However, due to the denied claim, size of the project, and the requirements of the city, the financial scope goes beyond JBY's capacity to do it on our own.  </p>

<p>Up to this point JBY has raised all but $50k, and considering the total amount we are very close! So, we are asking for <strong>$50,000 in 50 days</strong>, and with the magic we have witnessed within this community, we know just how possible this is.  </p>
<p>Any and all support for the JBY Studio Expansion will go <i>directly</i> into the project itself:</p>

</div>
<p>Any amount brought in by this campaign would make it a success.  Why $15K, its simple, with those proceeds we can build one well in Africa.  A well that will literally change lives for years and years to come.  Building 1 well is a huge success, anything after that multiplies the good we can do together.  </p>
<p>How many wells can we handle? It takes a lot of wells to provide water to 783,000,000 people.  There isn't hardly a number that is too high. Even the glass manufacturers can pump out 1000's of bottles a day.  We know our goal is doable, the question is how far can we exceed it?</p>

constructed through Vitrum are made by using small rigs that drill about 60
meters (200 feet) into the Earth, removing and cutting through dirt and rock. A
casing is inserted to keep the hole from collapsing. Next, a concrete base is
formed around the casing. Once the base is dry (usually overnight) the pump
mechanism can be lowered into the casing and the hand pump is installed. The
team will then test the quantity and quality of the water flow.  The wells are sealed and have little to no
chance of contamination.</span></p>

countries are reliable and accessible for the people who live there. Vitrum
currently has agreements with charities in both Ethiopia and Malawi that will
provide well construction. They are working in several communities and are

<p>Guaranteed.  Well water is the answer for the majority of people whose only current access to water is from a contaminated source. Building wells in villages is an inclusive solution.  Wells last a long time, often up to 15 years or more.  Most wells last at least 10 years.</p>
<p>A well will provide clean water for hundreds of people; it can serve thousands depending on the type of well and location. We have several established charities in Africa that are excited to help us.  They already have projects ongoing in villages including education, sanitation, and clean water.  They discern where the most prevalent needs are. By partnering with these charities we are able to very quickly bring water to these villages, in most cases within a few months of selling bottles.  Each bottle sold contributes to the funds Vitrum will then use to afford materials, labor, and other building costs. The number of wells needed for each area correlates to how many people each well can serve. </p>
<p>There are many organizations working to provide humanitarian aid in developing countries.  Our end goal is to create an accessible avenue for each of us to join the fight against contaminated drinking water and water related disease around the world.  </p>

<p>We (Kyle and Amy) personally
saved the money from the internship and bought enough school supplies for all
of the children in the orphanage. Each child received pencils, erasers, pens,

boxes the excitement in the air was almost tangible. In that moment we knew
somehow, someday we would build a company that would be founded on giving…on changing people’s

Reaching our Goal

Any amount brought in by this campaign would make it a success.  Why $15K, its simple, with those proceeds we can build one well in Africa.  A well that will literally change lives for years and years to come.  Building 1 well is a huge success, anything after that multiplies the good we can do together.  
How many wells can we handle? It takes a lot of wells to provide water to 783,000,000 people.  There isn't hardly a number that is too high. Even the glass manufacturers can pump out 1000's of bottles a day.  We know our goal is doable, the question is how far can we exceed it?




Wells and Charities


The majority of wells
constructed through Vitrum are made by using small rigs that drill about 60
meters (200 feet) into the Earth, removing and cutting through dirt and rock. A
casing is inserted to keep the hole from collapsing. Next, a concrete base is
formed around the casing. Once the base is dry (usually overnight) the pump
mechanism can be lowered into the casing and the hand pump is installed. The
team will then test the quantity and quality of the water flow.  The wells are sealed and have little to no
chance of contamination.



Wells constructed in the villages of developing
countries are reliable and accessible for the people who live there. Vitrum
currently has agreements with charities in both Ethiopia and Malawi that will
provide well construction. They are working in several communities and are
waiting on funding so that they can begin well construction.  There are hundreds of locations with similar
needs.
10 Years of Water
Guaranteed.  Well water is the answer for the majority of people whose only current access to water is from a contaminated source. Building wells in villages is an inclusive solution.  Wells last a long time, often up to 15 years or more.  Most wells last at least 10 years.
A well will provide clean water for hundreds of people; it can serve thousands depending on the type of well and location. We have several established charities in Africa that are excited to help us.  They already have projects ongoing in villages including education, sanitation, and clean water.  They discern where the most prevalent needs are. By partnering with these charities we are able to very quickly bring water to these villages, in most cases within a few months of selling bottles.  Each bottle sold contributes to the funds Vitrum will then use to afford materials, labor, and other building costs. The number of wells needed for each area correlates to how many people each well can serve. 
There are many organizations working to provide humanitarian aid in developing countries.  Our end goal is to create an accessible avenue for each of us to join the fight against contaminated drinking water and water related disease around the world.  
Giving is what it’s all about…


No matter what the cause
has been we find that in the end, giving is what it is all about. There
are several great causes to get attached to, causes that truly make the world a
better place.  Ours cause is saving lives
through clean water. 

On that premise Vitrum was
formed. As a company, it is the humanitarian effort that motivates us. Each day
we are just as thankful to go to work as we are to return home. There is deep
fulfillment in knowing that our work and these bottles are providing clean well
water to individuals who are just as real as you and I. 

Every person, whether giving or receiving,  benefits through Vitrum. These beautiful
glass water bottles become the symbol of what our customers have really done
for the world. We hope you think of the lives you have improved and even saved
each time the glass touches your lips.
The Inspiration

Years ago while doing an
internship in Pretoria, South Africa we had the privilege of replacing the
ceiling of an orphanage and school.  While there, the founder of Vitrum
(Kyle Nehring) was speaking with the matron of the orphanage.  While inquiring after the children's immediate needs we learned that in developing countries,
especially in Africa, despite the public education system where everyone is
able to learn, they often do not have any or nearly enough school supplies. 

As a volunteer teacher in
Africa put it, ""It is very difficult to teach the children how to write
when all 10 kids at a table are sharing a single pencil without an
eraser."" Poverty is a real issue in developing countries.  In addition to all this there are many people that do not have their parents due to AIDS
and other life threatening diseases.

  
We (Kyle and Amy) personally
saved the money from the internship and bought enough school supplies for all
of the children in the orphanage. Each child received pencils, erasers, pens,
notebooks, a pencil sharpener, and a ruler. The day we arrived and unloaded the
boxes the excitement in the air was almost tangible. In that moment we knew
somehow, someday we would build a company that would be founded on giving…on changing people’s
lives.  That was nearly 5 years ago, but memories like that don't fade fast, we want to continue to do good things.

  


What can you do to help
The obvious answer is to get a bottle of your own, if your finances are such that they won't allow for extra money to go out the door, not a problem, please share this with your friends and family.  Getting the word out is as important as purchasing a bottle.

<div>Eclipse day and the following days have been incredibly busy! As you may have seen on our updates, on the 20th March we were able to fly a helium balloon to the stratosphere from Spain, carrying a spherical camera, as well as another spherical camera on a Ultramagic hot-air balloon in Svalbard. The spherical videos are being processed. In the mean time, check out this surreal panoramic view of the eclipse from the balloon in Svalbard...</div>

The conditions were very difficult, the trajectory was very long making the recovery risky (and also too costly!). We decided it better to go with the safe and sure option of a flight on a hot-air balloon and a stratospheric flight in Spain only. However the good news is that we learnt a lot of things, and we hope to be able to fly next year during another total solar eclipse in Indonesia (not at the North Pole, but still spectacular...).</span></div>

<h3>Eclipses have always been around...</h3> <p></p>
<p>On March 20<sup>th</sup>
of this year there will be a Total Solar Eclipse. Sure, eclipses happen quite
often. But this one’s different: the Moon’s shadow will sweep over the North
Pole! That’s an event that occurs once every 500,000 years or so! </p>
<p>Seen from the North
Pole, the Moon's apparent diameter will appear larger than the Sun itself,
blocking all direct sunlight and turning day into night. This means that the
Solar Eclipse will take place just as the Sun comes into view after 6 long
months of polar night. How cool is that!</p>
<p>Total solar eclipses
are only visible along a narrow band typically 100 to 400km wide. Therefore, the
only populated areas where the March 20<sup>th</sup> eclipse will be visible
are Svalbard and the Faroe Islands. Thanks to relatively good weather conditions,
Svalbard is beyond competition regarding expected visibility. However, there’s still
a very high probability of cloud cover there, threatening to take away much of the
phenomena’s spectacular excitement. </p>

<br/><h3>Recovery and distribution? We need your help!</h3>
<div>
Remember: an opportunity like this only comes around
once every 500,000 years or so! Therefore, we have to make sure that we get it
right the first (and only) time. Spain’s weather conditions are quite different
than snowy Svalbard’s, and the balloon recovery terrain might be very hard to
access. What good is it to fly a camera if we can't recover it and watch the
images?<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here is where we need
your help!</p>
<p>We’ll need your
support to ensure that we get the balloon’s touchdown timing exactly right, that
our camera angles are correctly set to catch the eclipse, that we have all
resources to operate during polar conditions, and that we can successfully
recover the cameras once they’re on the ground (keep in mind that recovery
could be in water or in a very remote area only accessible by helicopter, not
to mention that we also need to be prepared for any encounters with polar bears...
no kidding!). </p>
</div>
<div>We also want to create some amazing footage from all the images and videos recorded! This will be a more demanding job than what we are used to doing, and we'll need help for that. Finally, we'd like to involve as many people as possible for this event, so that these stunning images will be widely distributed and utilized!</div>
<div>The objectives of the flight are:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Record in HD the total solar eclipse at the North Pole - a once in 500,000 years event</li>
<li>Promote education in science, physics, astronomy and engineering</li>
<li>Create enthusiasm about the eclipse, extreme environments, northern lights, extreme ballooning and other space-related events</li>
<li>Raise further awareness about climate change : 20 to 30 years ago there was rarely open water in the northern parts of Svalbard end of March, this situation is rapidly changing with increase in temperatures. Images from the flight, and recovery operations of the balloon will enable observations of polar ice and help raise awareness of the Arctic's continuous ice melting.</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
We know how to fly our spherical camera in good weather
conditions, using a high-altitude balloon with a parachute, tracking its flight
and recovering it. We need your help to make sure that we can recover these
cameras in the harsh North Pole environment where the chances are very high
that the balloon will drift to an area that’s hard to access. We will need a
boat, or even a helicopter – transportation means not unusual there. This could
turn out to be a rather expensive affair.</div>

<div>With EUR 20,000 
we can guarantee a successful recovery operation,
retrieving the cameras and getting access to the video of the Total Solar Eclipse.
With an additional EUR 5,000, we can post-process and render amazing footage
with the recovered videos, including time-lapse videos and educational content,
and widely distribute it. We will first distribute it to you, our funders, and
then to other audiences as an educational resource.</div>
<div>
Should the recovery operations turn out to be
easier than expected, we will have more cash to use on additional perks to
thank you, our funders! Yet if, for any reason, we fail at recovering good
images of the flight, we will make it up to you! We already have some ideas and
some exciting perks that will be offered to you as compensation.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Why is this small flight so important to us? And why should it be to you? </p> <ul> <li>
Historically, high-altitude ballooning is the best
way to access Space, and we believe it has a lot to offer in the future. Our
ultimate objective is to bring passengers up there. The March 20<sup>th</sup>
mission is just a small step in a much larger plan. How would you like to watch the next eclipse from a balloon yourself? Witness the shadow of the Moon passing over the Earth with your own eyes? This is what we are striving to do. We have already achieved a lot. You can learn more about those plans <a href=""http://inbloon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://vimeo.com/user19680663"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</li>
<li>This is a completely environmentally-friendly flight to the edge of Space. It doesn't harm the atmosphere, and actually inspires people to want to protect the Earth. 
Such feeling is known as an “Overview Effect”, and
it’s something every astronaut has experienced. We believe that showing
impressive images of the Arctic region taken from Space can have a substantial
impact. A gentle ascent with a balloon, for a couple of hours, and you’re already
outside of our atmosphere – that thin ribbon of air that keeps us alive...
Think about it!</li>
<li>
For us, this is a means to engage people in what we
believe in! Space doesn’t have to be expensive and far from everyday life. We
want to bring Space closer and make you a part of the dream. We want to bring
you with us on our adventures, give you the opportunity to launch something
with us, welcome you into our workshop, and start working on this dream
together! </li> </ul>

</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Biggest Challenges</h3> <p> Svalbard is one of the most remote places in the world, need we say more? Recovery of the payload is definitely our biggest challenge. The good news is that launching balloons from up there is common practice. There is a big balloon launch base operational there, set up by <a href=""http://www.theistargroup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The ISTAR Group</a> along with the University of Rome La Sapienza, and recoveries can be organized either by boat or by helicopter. This is a short duration flight, only a couple of hours, so it should not go too far. We also have a lot of historical data and lessons learnt from previous campaigns, which will help us make this campaign successful! </p>
<p>The other challenge is to record the eclipse in the best conditions and not miss the actual eclipse. To make sure we have the right footage, we will fly a spherical camera we built ourselves, made up of 6 GoPro Cameras! It films 360 degrees, so no angle is left uncovered!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1233041/files/20150219035129-camera_sferica.png?1424346689"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

As stated earlier: if, for any reason, the flight is unsuccessful, and we are not able to deliver the video of the eclipse to you, we will make it up to you. Images from Near-Space are always breath-taking, and we will organize another flight just for you! <br/>

Eclipse day and the following days have been incredibly busy! As you may have seen on our updates, on the 20th March we were able to fly a helium balloon to the stratosphere from Spain, carrying a spherical camera, as well as another spherical camera on a Ultramagic hot-air balloon in Svalbard. The spherical videos are being processed. In the mean time, check out this surreal panoramic view of the eclipse from the balloon in Svalbard...




We are disappointed we weren't able to fly our balloon to space. The conditions were very difficult, the trajectory was very long making the recovery risky (and also too costly!). We decided it better to go with the safe and sure option of a flight on a hot-air balloon and a stratospheric flight in Spain only. However the good news is that we learnt a lot of things, and we hope to be able to fly next year during another total solar eclipse in Indonesia (not at the North Pole, but still spectacular...).
On the perks side, do not worry, you will get what you asked for - we are processing the spherical video, the photos, and getting your little presents ready! Stay tuned!
And it's still time to contribute! Until sunday... Thank you so much to all of you who have already contributed for your support and enthusiasm!
It's here!

The first image from the Eclipse in Svalbard just came in! Taken by David Jiménez, our eyes in the North! Just wow...
Stay tuned, much more to come!
Final push!!

It looks like we are going to be able to launch!! But we need your help! This is the current trajectory prediction for the balloon flight from Svalbard on friday during the eclipse. 


This trajectory would mean we need a helicopter to get to the launch place, but that the recovery would be pretty easy, near the town of Longyearbyen. Please help us fund this helicopter ride, so we can make this historical flight a reality! 
Share, spread the word, and let's fly!


It's getting closer!



One week left before the eclipse! The team was in the field today near Barcelona, to test the spherical camera and all other systems to make sure everything will go well! 
We are far from our goal, and the eclipse flight from Svalbard is getting very tricky!! Weather and funds are against us... But we keep on fighting! David Lazaro Jimenez of zero2infinity is almost all packed, including balloons and cameras, and will be joining the team of Ultramagic in Svalbard next week. As a back-up we will also be flying another spherical camera from Spain to catch the partial eclipse! 
We need your support more than ever!! Share with your networks, and consider adding another perk to your portfolio! You will at least get images from Svalbard, from the eclipse from the ground, and an amazing spherical video of the partial eclipse directly on your phone!!




Summary


We want to record the solar eclipse using a 360º spherical camera from Space using a high-altitude balloon


This has never been done before! The total solar eclipse is at the North Pole and it will take 500,000 years to come again. Imagine the North Pole in 500,000 years... there probably won't be ice there anymore!

We are experienced in high-altitude ballooning and have already taken the first ever spherical video from Space: it's quite amazing. Spherical video
Recovery and distribution of the images are crucial aspects of the flight and we need your help! The faster we get to our goal, the more chances we have to make this happen! Find out more below, subscribe to one of our exciting perks, and climb on board with us!

Eclipses have always been around... 
On March 20th
of this year there will be a Total Solar Eclipse. Sure, eclipses happen quite
often. But this one’s different: the Moon’s shadow will sweep over the North
Pole! That’s an event that occurs once every 500,000 years or so! 
Seen from the North
Pole, the Moon's apparent diameter will appear larger than the Sun itself,
blocking all direct sunlight and turning day into night. This means that the
Solar Eclipse will take place just as the Sun comes into view after 6 long
months of polar night. How cool is that!
Total solar eclipses
are only visible along a narrow band typically 100 to 400km wide. Therefore, the
only populated areas where the March 20th eclipse will be visible
are Svalbard and the Faroe Islands. Thanks to relatively good weather conditions,
Svalbard is beyond competition regarding expected visibility. However, there’s still
a very high probability of cloud cover there, threatening to take away much of the
phenomena’s spectacular excitement. 




   
The path of the eclipse over Svalbard on 20th March 2015
...and we want to be the first to record it in HD from the stratosphere!


To get around this
problem, we will record and deliver images of the arctic eclipse and its shadow
from above the clouds, showing the world what an eclipse looks like from Space!
We will use our
zero-emissions stratospheric balloon to carry GoPro cameras mounted on a rig to
record a 360 degree spherical video at an altitude where the view of the Earth
and the Sun is very similar to what astronauts experience from the
International Space Station. Then, on the ground you will receive the video
feed into your tablet or smart phone, being able to feel as if you were in
Space – looking out your “window” to see the whole world below. 

Get an idea of what to expect by viewing this video we recorded on a previous flight over Spain: it's breath-taking! Now imagine witnessing the shadow of the Moon over the Earth...

Our team is located in Barcelona, Spain and we have been launching balloons since 2009, from very small to very big. We have all the equipment and the knowledge needed for this flight to be a success. 
How does the usual small helium balloon flight work?
1) Watch the weather, the wind predictions and the expected trajectories


2) Choose the right launch site. This depends on where you want the balloon to land! Not on where it is prettiest or easiest...



3) 
Drive to the launch site, early in the morning. Pack
balloons, helium bottles, parachute, cameras, batteries, thermal protection,
ground cloth, ropes, tools, computer, tracking system (GPS, Iridium...), and
the flight permit. 



4) Inflate the balloon, coordinate with air traffic, check all camera batteries and that all systems are ""on"", and... let it go.



5) Follow the path of the balloon (and have some breakfast). It takes about 2 hours for the flight to be completed.



6) Drive to the expected recovery location. When the balloon has landed, recover the payload and the parachute. 


7) Enjoy the images!

we can guarantee a successful recovery operation,
retrieving the cameras and getting access to the video of the Total Solar Eclipse.
With an additional EUR 5,000, we can post-process and render amazing footage
with the recovered videos, including time-lapse videos and educational content,
and widely distribute it. We will first distribute it to you, our funders, and
then to other audiences as an educational resource.

Should the recovery operations turn out to be
easier than expected, we will have more cash to use on additional perks to
thank you, our funders! Yet if, for any reason, we fail at recovering good
images of the flight, we will make it up to you! We already have some ideas and
some exciting perks that will be offered to you as compensation.
   The Impact Why is this small flight so important to us? And why should it be to you?   
Historically, high-altitude ballooning is the best
way to access Space, and we believe it has a lot to offer in the future. Our
ultimate objective is to bring passengers up there. The March 20th
mission is just a small step in a much larger plan. How would you like to watch the next eclipse from a balloon yourself? Witness the shadow of the Moon passing over the Earth with your own eyes? This is what we are striving to do. We have already achieved a lot. You can learn more about those plans here and here.
This is a completely environmentally-friendly flight to the edge of Space. It doesn't harm the atmosphere, and actually inspires people to want to protect the Earth. 
Such feeling is known as an “Overview Effect”, and
it’s something every astronaut has experienced. We believe that showing
impressive images of the Arctic region taken from Space can have a substantial
impact. A gentle ascent with a balloon, for a couple of hours, and you’re already
outside of our atmosphere – that thin ribbon of air that keeps us alive...
Think about it!

For us, this is a means to engage people in what we
believe in! Space doesn’t have to be expensive and far from everyday life. We
want to bring Space closer and make you a part of the dream. We want to bring
you with us on our adventures, give you the opportunity to launch something
with us, welcome you into our workshop, and start working on this dream
together!

Biggest Challenges  Svalbard is one of the most remote places in the world, need we say more? Recovery of the payload is definitely our biggest challenge. The good news is that launching balloons from up there is common practice. There is a big balloon launch base operational there, set up by The ISTAR Group along with the University of Rome La Sapienza, and recoveries can be organized either by boat or by helicopter. This is a short duration flight, only a couple of hours, so it should not go too far. We also have a lot of historical data and lessons learnt from previous campaigns, which will help us make this campaign successful! 
The other challenge is to record the eclipse in the best conditions and not miss the actual eclipse. To make sure we have the right footage, we will fly a spherical camera we built ourselves, made up of 6 GoPro Cameras! It films 360 degrees, so no angle is left uncovered!


The spherical camera. Photo credits: Cristóbal Castro - El País Thanks to our magical graphics and video guy (and also one of our mechanical engineers...), David Lázaro Jimenez, we will make sure to have an amazing video to show you!


As stated earlier: if, for any reason, the flight is unsuccessful, and we are not able to deliver the video of the eclipse to you, we will make it up to you. Images from Near-Space are always breath-taking, and we will organize another flight just for you!

<p><b>The Story of Our
Project</b></p>
<p>Hello! I am here to tell you about my company launching a
brand new service called Equetica.</p>
<p>Riders are passionate and devoted to the animals they
love.  Each year they give thousands of hours in hard training time and
emotional energy, not to mention the financial resources. All these elements
are needed and integral to the continued success of the industry and supporting
businesses.  </p>
<p>We developed Equetica in order to unify the equestrian
market.  Currently horse owners, riders,
trainers, shows, farriers, veterinarians, suppliers, insurance companies,
buyers, sellers and farms all operate independently of each other; even though
they affect each others outcome. This disconnect creates monetary pitfalls and
large consumptions of time and resources to navigate.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought about how to bridge the gap between
all the different components in the equestrian industry?</p>
<p>Do you want to join this movement connecting all industry
partners to benefit everybody, but don’t know how?</p>
<p>Are you interested in being part of our team?</p>
<p>If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you may
want to keep reading…</p>
<p><b>More about the
Project</b></p><p>Equetica has developed a new and proven method of data
aggregation, intelligence, and predictive modeling. This proprietary platform
will provide all participants in the industry the ability to reduce the money,
time, and resources by having access to the intelligence we produce.  </p>
<p>We feel if executed properly we can reach a large market
of people in need of an easier way to do business in the equestrian
industry.  Our proprietary components
will make us incredibly qualified to succeed in the equestrian industry.  This paired with attention to detail and
quality service will make us a key player, if not the leader in the equestrian
industry. Our mission is to take care of every supporter with the utmost respect
and care.  </p>
<p><b>About Me &amp; Why
I am Doing This </b></p>
<b></b><p>I Colin Schnebly, Founder of Equetica<b> </b>have never been
officially in the equestrian industry, but I’ve experienced and witnessed many
aspects of its wonder. I’m married to a hunter jumper who has ridden for thirty<b>-</b>five years. I have seen her go to bed
at mid-night preparing her horse and equipment for the next day’s competition,
then getting up at 4am to start the competition which last all day long. </p>
<p>I have always admired and was a bit jealous of this love
for this industry she exhibits. Over the years I developed a respect for the
riders prompting me to<b> </b>become a champion for their cause. 
Now I’m starting to ride and
understand the addiction. As a result of my experience of building a technology
based company for national corporations to manage and gain control of their
facility operations through intelligence, I saw a glaring parallel with the
equestrian industry. </p>
<p><b>The Experience </b></p>
<p>We will build a dedicated audience of horse enthusiast by
providing an interactive environment. Equetica is the new way of information
management, a technology company optimizing data intelligence.  We
leverage data in the equestrian market to substantially reduce time and costs.</p>
<p>Empower yourself!  Without historical information
personal assumptions and desires will make your decisions. Knowledge is power;
Equetica is your gateway to intelligence.  </p>
<b>The Future of The Platform ...</b><br/><br/><p>Most of you have accounts with Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google + and many
other social media platforms.  There is a common thread between all these,
communication and that is about it.  They limit or control the content you
can display about who you are and don't help you grow as an individual.    <br/></p>
<p>Currently, everyone  expects you to enter your information  into their systems, which is
useful for their revenue, not yours.  <br/></p>
<p> Aren't you sick of everyone else taking your information and benefiting from it, except you?  The individual never seems to advance personally from technology, only big corporations.  Donate as much as you can and change how individuals can grow by tracking what they already do! </p><p>The equestrian industry will be the first to change social media forever and you can be apart of it!  <br/></p><p>We have proven this model can <b>increase success by</b> <b>30% or more</b>.  What are you waiting for?  Help us, help you!   Contribute and receive a great gift.  Our t-shirts and hats are top of the line, but our most unique gift is the personal app which is explained a little more below.   </p><p><b>Phase One </b><br/></p>

have their own personal apps.  Have you

We are two everyday university students who are ambitious and passionate about the rapidly developing tech world. We met at university and discovered that we both had a passion for technology and  business, and wanted to share that passion with the world. After speaking with many new and experienced entrepreneurs and after attending many technology exhibitions, we found that the connection between consumers and entrepreneurs was not fully efficient. We went on to distribute a survey regarding this issue  and the results of the survey were the same---consumers were not fully exposed to new and innovative entrepreneurial products and entrepreneurs were not efficiently  engaging with consumers. We took a stance to mitigate and resolve this issue and thus GadgetBox was born. What's in the Box?The subscription box that is received on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis (Depending on the subscription plan you choose) will include unique and innovative tech/design gadgets. It can be anything from newly designed & sound efficient wireless headphones to a 3D printing pen to a Smart Lightbulb and so on. The box full of gadgets that will arrive at your home will contain anywhere between 2-6 gadgets/products (Once again, the amount of products received will depend on the subscription plan that you choose)What Do Others Say?We have received many positive response and feedback from prospective clients and from a survey that we launched a few months back. Here are just a few of the responses:""I think that it is an amazing service that really helps you put into perspective the true benefits of electronics and technology. Truly amazing.""--Paula B.""It's a great opportunity for entrepreneurs and small business owners to really take their product to the next level in terms of exposure. Really something out of the ordinary.""--Kevin P.""If you like technology then this is definitely for you.""--Kurt B.MISCELLANEOUS *You can sign-up on our email list to receive the latest updates and for a chance to win a year's worth of subscription boxes! *Click the link here to join our email list: http://gadgetbox.launchrock.com/*(You can send a tweet or send a private message through Indiegogo for any questions or comments.

And Deliver 2-3 Hours Of Natural Uplifting Energy - No Jitters, No 
Crash. Made With Natural Ingredients In The USA.</i><br/></p><h3>Our Story</h3><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Hi, my name is Patricia McCabe, and I’m the co-creator of
NRG MicroShots, along with my partner and husband Matt McCabe. This campaign is important to us because we need your
help. We have the kind of product that needs to go big in order to make it. We
need to be able to produce NRG MicroShots in larger quantities, and with some
product variations, to be successful. This can be done with the help of your support in funding our project.

</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1222052/files/20150214165511-Website_-_Single.jpg?1423961711"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our business is family owned and operated - my husband and I have four
active children all between the ages of 6 and 19 years old – and we are
literally building it from the ground up. NRG MicroShots stem from an old family recipe, on my mom’s side, for apple cider. The recipe calls for
ingredients like cinnamon, orange, clove, apple, “secret” spices, apple cider
vinegar, and honey.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1222108/files/20150214180614-9.jpg?1423965974"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We also incorporate energy supplement ingredients like natural
caffeine from real coffee beans, taurine, n-acetyl, l-tyrosine, and vitamins
B3, B6, and B12:<br/> <ul>
<li>
<i>Vitamin B Complex</i> - Essential to maintain a healthy nervous system, raise good cholesterol, and increase metabolism.</li>
<li>
<i>Natural Caffeine </i>- Keeps us alert and awake, reduces the risk of heart disease and diabetes, and is an effective antioxidant.</li>
<li>
<i>Taurine </i>- Essential for cardiovascular function, development and function of skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system.</li>
<li>
<i>N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine </i>- Improves brain function and increases mental alertness.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1222109/files/20150214180702-8.jpg?1423966022"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All the ingredients come together nicely, allowing us to create an 
energy drink that works great, tastes great, and makes your body feel
great – it’s a 5ml micro energy shot that delivers hours of energy.</p> <ul>
<li>1 NRG MicroShot has as much caffeine as 1 cup of coffee and provides hours of energy - 130mg.<br/>
</li>
<li>Fast acting with more control over when and how much energy is delivered.</li>
<li>No carbohydrates and only 7 calories per serving.</li>
<li>No jitters and no sugar crash.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Here is what's being said about NRG MicroShots:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1234141/files/20150219134306-Testimonials_copy2.jpg?1424382186"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<h3>Impact of NRG MicroShots<br/>
</h3> <p>I believe that we have created an awesome product that so many 
people can benefit from and enjoy - those who may be interested in energy shots, but don’t like the
 typically chalky or medicinal taste, the 2oz size, or the inconsistent 
effectiveness of other energy shots. <br/></p>
<p>NRG MicroShots taste great. They come in a small 5ml flip-top 
cylinder and provide hours of energy that feel natural to the

</div></div>","NRG MicroShots Are HandCrafted 5ml Micro Energy Shots That Taste Great 
And Deliver 2-3 Hours Of Natural Uplifting Energy - No Jitters, No 
Crash. Made With Natural Ingredients In The USA.Our Story
Hi, my name is Patricia McCabe, and I’m the co-creator of
NRG MicroShots, along with my partner and husband Matt McCabe. This campaign is important to us because we need your
help. We have the kind of product that needs to go big in order to make it. We
need to be able to produce NRG MicroShots in larger quantities, and with some
product variations, to be successful. This can be done with the help of your support in funding our project.


Our business is family owned and operated - my husband and I have four
active children all between the ages of 6 and 19 years old – and we are
literally building it from the ground up. NRG MicroShots stem from an old family recipe, on my mom’s side, for apple cider. The recipe calls for
ingredients like cinnamon, orange, clove, apple, “secret” spices, apple cider
vinegar, and honey.We also incorporate energy supplement ingredients like natural
caffeine from real coffee beans, taurine, n-acetyl, l-tyrosine, and vitamins
B3, B6, and B12: 

Vitamin B Complex - Essential to maintain a healthy nervous system, raise good cholesterol, and increase metabolism.

Natural Caffeine - Keeps us alert and awake, reduces the risk of heart disease and diabetes, and is an effective antioxidant.

Taurine - Essential for cardiovascular function, development and function of skeletal muscle, and the central nervous system.

N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine - Improves brain function and increases mental alertness.


All the ingredients come together nicely, allowing us to create an 
energy drink that works great, tastes great, and makes your body feel
great – it’s a 5ml micro energy shot that delivers hours of energy. 
1 NRG MicroShot has as much caffeine as 1 cup of coffee and provides hours of energy - 130mg.

Fast acting with more control over when and how much energy is delivered.
No carbohydrates and only 7 calories per serving.
No jitters and no sugar crash.


Here is what's being said about NRG MicroShots:


Impact of NRG MicroShots
 I believe that we have created an awesome product that so many 
people can benefit from and enjoy - those who may be interested in energy shots, but don’t like the
 typically chalky or medicinal taste, the 2oz size, or the inconsistent 
effectiveness of other energy shots. 
NRG MicroShots taste great. They come in a small 5ml flip-top 
cylinder and provide hours of energy that feel natural to the 
body - no jitters, no shakes. We're on to 
something and need your help to take it to the next level.

<div>
<p>I bought a former Indian restaurant and quickly discovered the space had way more substantial damage than I had previously thought and for what I was financially prepared.  The space had been operating as an Indian restaurant for the past 20 years when I bought it.  I naively thought taking over this existing restaurant would have less problems and would allow me to open quickly.</p>
<p>I was wrong.  Absolutely and completely wrong.</p>
<p>The damage I discovered was pretty much due to neglect, abuse and poor cleaning habits.  I even had to purge almost every single piece of equipment that came with the sale due to damage from misuse, neglect, and/or excessive grease.  I also lost 2 months trying to find replacement contractors after my original contractors bailed at the last minute.  When the new contractors finally came in, they discovered the kitchen walls and floors suffered from water damage, mold and wood rot from a bad plumbing system.   They also gradually discovered almost none of the plumbing and wiring was installed to code.</p>
<p>I have had this place since early January and was scheduled to open in late-February.  My timeline for opening has now been pushed back to early May.  To add to my challenges, I still have to pay rent because I was not able to successfully negotiate free rent from the landlord during the buildout phase.  My modest budget is quickly disappearing.  </p>

</h3>
</div><div> <p>Pampalasa means ""to add flavor, to season or to spice.""   Pampalasa will be a tropical, full-service restaurant serving rustic Filipino cuisine.  Its menu will reflect what many American-born Filipinos like me grew up with in our homes, but with just a touch of our own personal twist using healthier local ingredients and sustainable techniques - simple, yet fresh.  Thus, our menu will be a balance and mix of both traditional and modern dishes.</p>
<p>Filipino cuisine is recognizable by its tart flavors and vinegar base.  It is known for its combination of sour, sweet, salty and spicy...sometimes all in the same dish.  It reflects its centuries of colonization and foreign influences.  Pampalasa will initially only be open for lunch and weekend brunch, but will eventually expand to include regular dinner service.  I want our Filipino culture and cuisine to continue to be represented in San Francisco, and be represented well.</p>

<h3>Neighborhood</h3>
<p>Pampalasa is located on Folsom Street, between 8th and 9th Streets.  I am excited to be opening Pampalasa in SOMA, the historical home to the first generations of Filipino families in San Francisco since the early 1900's.   Many immigrant Filipino families and seniors still live and work there, a few nearby streets are named after Filipino heroes, Philippine murals still decorate some neighborhood walls and annual Filipino festivals are still celebrated.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Yet, through the result of ongoing gentrification in the SOMA neighborhood, the presence of the Filipino community is slowly dwindling.  It is my hope that by opening Pampalasa in our historical neighborhood, it will encourage other future entrepinoys to consider making SOMA their home so we do not completely lose our Filipino presence there.</p>

<h3>Filipino Foodie Generation</h3>
<h3></h3>
</span></h3>
<p>I am proud of my Filipino heritage.  I am proud of my Filipino culture.  I am part of the new Filipino foodie generation.  And I want to share my Filipino culture with all of you through food.  Filipino food, as with all cultures, always reminds us of family and our community gatherings.  Food brings people together.  Our culture influences our food which creates our memories.  It is in those memories of growing up in my Filipino culture here in America that is driving me to open Pampalasa.</p>

<p>My name is Jennifer Villamin and I am an American-born Filipino.  Like many American-born Filipinos growing up, I always wondered why there were never any Filipino restaurants around.  Why has Filipino food never become mainstream like a lot of the other Asian cuisines out there, especially since we were such a big population.   I want to help change this and be a part of the next generation of ""entrepinoys"" looking to elevate our cultural cuisine to the next level.  Opening this restaurant will fulfill my college dream of helping to give back to the community in a way I have never been able to do before with just my ongoing volunteer work.  This restaurant will also give me the opportunity to open people up to Filipino food and culture so that they'll discover that we are so much more than just lumpia, adobo and Manny Pacquio. </p>
<p>I worked about four years in the food industry in both back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house.   I was a cook for a couple years at the de Young Museum Cafe and with Taste Catering, along with being a cashier and food server for another couple years at random cafes.  I also volunteered a lot of my time as a culinary pavilion manager for local Filipino foodie events such as the <a href=""http://www.pistahan.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pistahan Parade and Festival</a> and <a href=""http://www.savorfilipino.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.savorfilipino.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Savor Filipino</a>.  Further, I went through the business program at the nonprofit <a href=""http://www.rencenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center</a> to put together a business plan.</p>
<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Looking forward...</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<div>Once Pampalasa is up and running, one of my goals is to quickly start hosting a Guest Chef Night with a different Filipino chef every week.  The Bay Area is filled with Filipinos in the food industry, yet, the vast majority of them are not able to cook their own Filipino cuisine commercially.  They are almost all cooking someone else's cultural cuisine.  Pampalasa will give these folks the commercial outlet for them to express their Filipino culture through their own interpretations of Filipino cuisine.</div>

I bought a former Indian restaurant and quickly discovered the space had way more substantial damage than I had previously thought and for what I was financially prepared.  The space had been operating as an Indian restaurant for the past 20 years when I bought it.  I naively thought taking over this existing restaurant would have less problems and would allow me to open quickly.
I was wrong.  Absolutely and completely wrong.
The damage I discovered was pretty much due to neglect, abuse and poor cleaning habits.  I even had to purge almost every single piece of equipment that came with the sale due to damage from misuse, neglect, and/or excessive grease.  I also lost 2 months trying to find replacement contractors after my original contractors bailed at the last minute.  When the new contractors finally came in, they discovered the kitchen walls and floors suffered from water damage, mold and wood rot from a bad plumbing system.   They also gradually discovered almost none of the plumbing and wiring was installed to code.
I have had this place since early January and was scheduled to open in late-February.  My timeline for opening has now been pushed back to early May.  To add to my challenges, I still have to pay rent because I was not able to successfully negotiate free rent from the landlord during the buildout phase.  My modest budget is quickly disappearing.  
                  
The Fix

I am asking for your help in raising $20,000 to help pay for the added construction repairs and to buy and/or replace all the damaged equipment I could not use from the sale.  My small business loan I got through the City is almost exhausted trying to keep up with all these unexpected  repairs.  All I wanted to do was just share my Filipino culture through food, but these repairs are too much for me to bear on my own.  This money will at least pay for these unbudgeted repairs, and also help me buy the remaining equipment needed for the kitchen.
If you want to help and be a part of getting the doors open to the newest Filipino restaurant in San Francisco, then please contribute now.  This campaign has a very short window, but I know we can make this happen.  Let's make this happen!
$16,000:  to cover extra repairs from hidden damages.
$4,000:  to buy remaining equipment needed to outfit the kitchen.
$20,000 = TOTAL NEEDED



Pampalasa and the Vision

 Pampalasa means ""to add flavor, to season or to spice.""   Pampalasa will be a tropical, full-service restaurant serving rustic Filipino cuisine.  Its menu will reflect what many American-born Filipinos like me grew up with in our homes, but with just a touch of our own personal twist using healthier local ingredients and sustainable techniques - simple, yet fresh.  Thus, our menu will be a balance and mix of both traditional and modern dishes.
Filipino cuisine is recognizable by its tart flavors and vinegar base.  It is known for its combination of sour, sweet, salty and spicy...sometimes all in the same dish.  It reflects its centuries of colonization and foreign influences.  Pampalasa will initially only be open for lunch and weekend brunch, but will eventually expand to include regular dinner service.  I want our Filipino culture and cuisine to continue to be represented in San Francisco, and be represented well.


   
Neighborhood
Pampalasa is located on Folsom Street, between 8th and 9th Streets.  I am excited to be opening Pampalasa in SOMA, the historical home to the first generations of Filipino families in San Francisco since the early 1900's.   Many immigrant Filipino families and seniors still live and work there, a few nearby streets are named after Filipino heroes, Philippine murals still decorate some neighborhood walls and annual Filipino festivals are still celebrated.

Yet, through the result of ongoing gentrification in the SOMA neighborhood, the presence of the Filipino community is slowly dwindling.  It is my hope that by opening Pampalasa in our historical neighborhood, it will encourage other future entrepinoys to consider making SOMA their home so we do not completely lose our Filipino presence there.

Filipino Foodie Generation


I am proud of my Filipino heritage.  I am proud of my Filipino culture.  I am part of the new Filipino foodie generation.  And I want to share my Filipino culture with all of you through food.  Filipino food, as with all cultures, always reminds us of family and our community gatherings.  Food brings people together.  Our culture influences our food which creates our memories.  It is in those memories of growing up in my Filipino culture here in America that is driving me to open Pampalasa.
Who is this girl??
  
My name is Jennifer Villamin and I am an American-born Filipino.  Like many American-born Filipinos growing up, I always wondered why there were never any Filipino restaurants around.  Why has Filipino food never become mainstream like a lot of the other Asian cuisines out there, especially since we were such a big population.   I want to help change this and be a part of the next generation of ""entrepinoys"" looking to elevate our cultural cuisine to the next level.  Opening this restaurant will fulfill my college dream of helping to give back to the community in a way I have never been able to do before with just my ongoing volunteer work.  This restaurant will also give me the opportunity to open people up to Filipino food and culture so that they'll discover that we are so much more than just lumpia, adobo and Manny Pacquio. 
I worked about four years in the food industry in both back-of-the-house and front-of-the-house.   I was a cook for a couple years at the de Young Museum Cafe and with Taste Catering, along with being a cashier and food server for another couple years at random cafes.  I also volunteered a lot of my time as a culinary pavilion manager for local Filipino foodie events such as the Pistahan Parade and Festival and Savor Filipino.  Further, I went through the business program at the nonprofit Renaissance Entrepreneurship Center to put together a business plan.

Looking forward...


Once Pampalasa is up and running, one of my goals is to quickly start hosting a Guest Chef Night with a different Filipino chef every week.  The Bay Area is filled with Filipinos in the food industry, yet, the vast majority of them are not able to cook their own Filipino cuisine commercially.  They are almost all cooking someone else's cultural cuisine.  Pampalasa will give these folks the commercial outlet for them to express their Filipino culture through their own interpretations of Filipino cuisine.

But first, I have to get the doors open...

<p><b>                                                                      la transparence. </b></p>
<p>Il faut que l'électeur ait confiance dans le mode de scrutin. Que celui-ci ne semble pas entaché d'irrégularités, de fraudes, d'erreurs. Que le délai entre la fin du scrutin et la proclamation des résultats soit le plus faible possible afin de couper court à d'éventuelles rumeurs de manipulations. </p>
<p>Nous sommes des citoyens, de simples électeurs comme vous. Nous sommes choqués par les fraudes avérées ou suspectées qui apparaissent à chaque élection, quel que soit le pays, ou par les délais nécessaires pour compter et recompter encore des bulletins dont le nombre ne correspond pas au nombre de votes émis...</p>
<p>Nous avons inventé HANNIBAL® pour offrir à chacun un outil fiable, économique et rapide, pour que chacun ait confiance dans le scrutin. </p>
<p>HANNIBAL® utilise la technologie mondialement éprouvée de la lecture des codes barres. Un flash code QRCode est un langage universel, un alphabet lisible par n'importe quel lecteur de code barres. </p>
<p>HANNIBAL® va simplement lire le code barres imprimé au verso du bulletin, l'enregistrer pendant que le bulletin est stocké dans l'urne et donner un résultat ordonné à l'ouverture de l'urne en réalisant un véritable dépouillement automatique. </p>
<p>Sans intelligence, sans programmation, ne délivrant qu'un résultat brut sans transformation, le système ne peut être piraté. </p>
<p>Sa simplicité le rend extrêmement robuste et fiable. </p>
<p>Il est le pilier sur lequel peut se construire une véritable démocratie.</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de chacun de vous pour nous aider à fabriquer et distribuer ce nouveau concept, mais surtout pour le promouvoir. Parlez en autour de vous. Interpellez vos représentants, les responsables politiques, professionnels, syndicaux. </p>
<p>Hannibal® est également utile dans les élections professionnelles.</p>
<p>Cet outil ne change pas les habitudes de vote, mais est une telle innovation, et dans un domaine tellement sensible, que seul le nombre de citoyens intéressés pourra le faire adopter par les organisateurs. </p>
<p>D'avance Merci.</p>

<p><b>HANNIBAL® repose sur trois éléments principaux:</b></p>
<h3><b>1- LE BULLETIN DE VOTE</b></h3>
<p>Un bulletin de vote normal, uninominal, sur lequel est écrit en toutes lettres le nom du candidat ou de la liste candidate au recto.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277804/files/20150308081814-bulletin_V_H.jpg?1425827894"" src="""" style=""width: 719.3652968036529px; height: 514px;""/></p>
<p>Ce bulletin est pré-plié afin de faciliter sa bonne introduction dans l'enveloppe par l'électeur.</p>
<p>Au verso est imprimé le code barres que l'urne va enregistrer comme étant un vote pour Victor HUGO. Le nom est noyé dans le nom des autres candidats afin d'obtenir un code barres peu identifiable à l'œil nu pour préserver la confidentialité du vote au cas où le code barres était subrepticement aperçu par un observateur.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277743/files/20150308075202-code_V_H.jpg?1425826322"" src="""" style=""width: 84.29473684210527px; height: 77px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2- L'ENVELOPPE</b></h3>
<p>De taille adaptée au bulletin plié en deux, elle présente une fenêtre masquée par un volet sur sa face avant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1235759/files/20150220074052-Enveloppe_ferm_e.jpg?1424446852"" src="""" style=""width: 447.40899357601717px; height: 337px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>L'enveloppe ne permet pas de connaitre son contenu et donc respecte la confidentialité du vote.</p>
<p>En relevant le volet, on aperçoit le code barres du candidat choisi par l'électeur:</p>
<p></p>

<br/><h3><b>3- L'URNE:</b></h3>
<div>Elle se présente comme une urne traditionnelle, dans ses dimensions et son apparence. En France, la transparence en est un caractère obligatoire depuis le 1er Janvier 1991. Pour d'autres pays, la couleur est codifiée ainsi que son opacité: Hannibal est facilement adaptable aux contingences locales.</div>
<div>Nous avons travaillé son design afin d'essayer de transmettre une idée de force, de stabilité mais également de dynamique. Nous espérons que c'est ainsi que vous la percevez!</div>
<div>

<div>Sous le couvercle est fixé une boite contenant un lecteur de code barres, un système de rouleaux asservis, une mémoire permanente, un écran supérieur indiquant le nombre de votes enregistrés par l'urne (et donc le nombre d'enveloppes présentes dans l'urne), une zone résistive sur le dessus permettant d'enclencher l'avancement de l'enveloppe et un écran tactile en dessous, accessible uniquement quand l'urne est ouverte.</div>

</div>
<h2><b>DÉROULEMENT DU SCRUTIN</b></h2>
<div>L'électeur prend les bulletins présentés pré-pliés au bureau des scrutateurs qui contrôlent son identité et son habilitation à voter.</div>
<div>Dans le secret de l'isoloir, l'électeur choisit son bulletin, le plie en deux, codes barres à l'extérieur et l'introduit dans l'enveloppe.</div>
<div><p>                                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1292006/files/20150313063010-isoloirs.jpg?1426253410"" src="""" style=""width: 260.203125px; height: 390px;""/></p></div>
<div>Il introduit son enveloppe dans l'urne. Le scrutateur enclenche, par contact sur la zone résistive, l'admission de l'enveloppe par les rouleaux.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277641/files/20150308062744-languette_soulev_e.png?1425821264"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>Un système mécanique simple soulève le volet juste avant son admission dans l'urne, découvrant ainsi le code barres visible à travers la fenêtre de l'enveloppe.</div>
<div>Le lecteur de code barres lit ce code et enregistre le ou les noms compris entre deux signes. Si jamais il n'arrivait pas à les lire pour une quelconque raison, l'enveloppe serait recrachée et le scrutateur devrait la rendre à l'électeur et inviter ce dernier à recommencer le processus de vote.</div>
<div>

<div>L'enveloppe poursuit sa route et est stockée pour un éventuel comptage manuel ultérieur (suite à une défaillance technique par exemple). Le compteur supérieur s'incrémente d'un.</div>
<div>A la clôture du scrutin, décidée par le président du bureau de vote, l'ouverture de l'urne bloque le système et empêche tout traitement ultérieur de bulletins de vote pirate.</div>
<div>L'allumage de l'écran interne permet d'accéder aux résultats, c'est à dire au nombre de fois que le lecteur a pu enregistrer chaque série de caractères. Les résultats sont présentés sous forme d'un tableau.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1284555/files/20150310134702-ecran_r_sultat.jpg?1426020422"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>

<p></p>
<p><b>Un lecteur avec écran  et sortie audio est en cours de développement</b>. </p>
<p>Tout électeur n'ayant pas de smartphone équipé d'une application de lecture de code barres peut ainsi vérifier que le code barres imprimé au verso correspond bien à son choix écrit au verso et empêche une tricherie éventuelle à l'impression des bulletins. </p>
<p>Il est également équipé d'une sortie audio (casque) dont l'utilisation éteint l'écran. Ainsi, il permet aux citoyens ayant des difficultés à lire (mal-voyance, illettrisme etc...) de pouvoir choisir son bulletin en toute confidentialité. </p>
<p>Même si son handicap l'oblige à recourir à une aide extérieure, celle-ci ne connaitra pas le choix du votant. </p>
<p>L'handicapé est enfin traité avec le même respect que le valide. </p>
<p>Sa dignité et sa liberté sont respectées.</p>

<p><i>'Democracy
is the worst form of government, </i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">except
all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.'</i></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">-Winston Churchill to the House of Commons,11</span><sup style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">th</sup><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
November 1947</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>But a prerequisite of democracy is an
electoral process which safeguards the essential elements of the ballot.</p>
<p>It must be </p>
<p> <b>              Confidential</b></p>
<p><b>                     Anonymous</b></p>
<p><b>                            Tamper-proof</b></p>
<p><b>                                      Transparent</b></p>
<p><b>                                                'One man, one vote'.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The voter must have confidence in the
count. It should not be tainted with irregularity, error or fraud, and should
minimise delay between the close of voting and the declaration of the result to
prevent rumours of manipulation.</p>
<p></p>
<p> We in 2Blokes are appalled by stories of actual or suspected
irregularities which can occur in elections in any country, and by the delays
caused by the need to count and recount ballot papers which do not correspond
with the number of votes cast. We have invented HANNIBAL to provide a reliable,
fast and economic means of ensuring confidence in the ballot.</p>
<p></p>
<p>HANNIBAL uses worldwide approved barcode
reading technology. QRCode is a universal barcode language recognised by all
barcode readers. </p>
<p>HANNIBAL simply reads barcodes printed on the ballot-paper,
records them as the ballot-paper is inserted into the ballot-box, and delivers
the required result when the ballot-box is opened – true automatic scrutiny! </p>
<p>The system can't be interfered with – no skill, no programming, delivering only
the raw result without frills. Its very simplicity makes it both robust and
reliable. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We need all of you to help us manufacture
and distribute this new concept, and especially to promote it. </p>
<p>Discuss it
amongst yourselves, talk to your parliamentary representatives, to people
involved in politics, to professional organisations, to trades unions. HANNIBAL
doesn't change voting patterns, but it's such a new concept in such a sensitive
area that only demand from those involved can bring about it's adoption.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you in advance! </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F95HIevHFXm4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D95HIevHFXm4&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F95HIevHFXm4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p><b>HANNIBAL is comprised of three main
elements</b></p>
<h2>1.<span> 
</span><b>The ballot paper</b>
</h2>
<p>A normal ballot paper, on the front of which
is printed a single candidate's name with his corresponding barcode on the
back</p>
<p></p>
<p>                   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291836/files/20150313042357-bulletin_V_H.jpg?1426245837"" src="""" style=""width: 614.8032407407408px; height: 439px;""/></p>
<p>It is pre-folded for ease of insertion by
the voter into an envelope which contains a window corresponding to the barcode
on the ballot paper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291837/files/20150313042437-code_V_H.jpg?1426245877"" src="""" style=""width: 104.41441441441442px; height: 95px;""/></p>
<p>The barcode which the ballot box will
read contains all the candidates' names or a long sentence. The selected name barcode is thus not distinguishable to the eye of a surreptitious observer, and preserves the confidentiality of the ballot. Only the selected candidate being
identified by a # sign before, and a * sign after the name will be recorded by Hannibal.</p>
<h2>  2. <b>The envelope</b>
</h2>
<p>The envelope is large enough to take the ballot paper folded in half
and contains a window  in front protected
by a flap, so that its contents are kept confidential. </p>
<p></p>
<p>                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291840/files/20150313042552-Enveloppe_ferm_e.jpg?1426245952"" src="""" style=""width: 409.98534798534797px; height: 293px;""/></p>
<p>When the flap is  lifted the barcode of the selected candidate
can be read.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291842/files/20150313042636-Enveloppe_ouverte.jpg?1426245996"" src="""" style=""width: 407.73818181818183px; height: 292px;""/></p>
<br/>
<h2>  3. <b>The ballot box</b>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Its shape, size and aspect are made similar to the ones used in the country. For example the french model, in which transparency is obligatory since 1991.</p>
<p></p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291861/files/20150313043322-urne_de_profil_vide.jpg?1426246402"" src="""" style=""width: 392px; height: 392px;""/></p>

<p>Under the cover is a box containing the barcode reader, a system of
driven rollers, a  permanent memory, an
upper screen indicating the number of votes cast and thus the  number of envelopes contained by the box, a
resistive area on the top enabling the envelope  to be drawn into the box, and a touch screen below which is only
accessible when the box is  opened.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291870/files/20150313043749-urne_du_dessus_en_d_but.jpg?1426246669"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ballot
box from above: a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">t
the start of voting, memories clear, ready to receive votes.</span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h2><b> Ballot
procedure</b></h2>
<p> The
voter is given pre-folded ballot papers by the scrutinizers who check his
identity and  that he is registered to
vote. In the privacy of the voting booth, the voter selects the ballot  paper containing the name of the candidate he
wishes to vote for, folds it in two with the  barcode
on the outside and places it in the envelope.</p>
<p></p>
<p>                                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291898/files/20150313050113-isoloirs.jpg?1426248073"" src="""" style=""width: 264.8734375px; height: 397px;""/></p>
<br/><p>He inserts the envelope in the
ballot  box. The envelope is drawn into
the box by a scrutinizer using the resistive area to activate  the rollers.</p>
<p> A
simple mechanical system raises the window flap as the envelope is drawn into
the box,  revealing the barcode now
visible through the window.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291900/files/20150313050356-languette_soulev_e.png?1426248236"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
<p>The barcode reader reads the code <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and
records the name or names marked by the # and * signs.</span></p>
<p> If
the reader can't read the barcode, the envelope is regurgitated, and the scrutinizer
returns it  to the voter so that he can
repeat his vote.</p>
<p> The
upper screen records an increment of one vote, and the envelope is stored in
case a  physical count is required later
(for example in the case of a technical breakdown).</p>
<p></p>
<p>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291882/files/20150313044740-urne_remplie.jpg?1426247260"" src="""" style=""width: 330px; height: 330px;""/></p>
<p> When
the ballot closes and the box is opened the system is automatically blocked,
and  cannot accept further ballot papers
i.e. irregular votes.</p>
<p> The
activation of the lower touch screen gives access to the results, that is the
number of  times that the barcode reader
has recorded each series of characters. The results are  displayed in tabular form</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1298213/files/20150316035943-_cran_r_sultat.jpg?1426503583"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p> The
result is immediately available, incontestable and free from error.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b> A
barcode reader equipped with a screen and headset</b> </p>
<p>is in course of development to enable a
voter w<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ho
has not got a smartphone equipped with a barcode reader app, to check that the  barcode registered by the box truly corresponds
with his choice of candidate(s). This controls and should  avoid
the possibility of fraudulent printing of the ballot paper. It will also be
equipped with  an audio socket, and when
the earpiece is plugged in, the screen will switch off. Thus voters  who are illiterate or have difficulty reading
can make a completely confidential choice.</span></p>
<p> Even
if the voter requires assistance from a third party, the voter's choice will
not be  disclosed. </p>
<p>The disabled are
treated with the same respect as the able-bodied.</p>
<p> Their
dignity and their liberty are safeguarded.</p>

        ""La démocratie est le pire des régimes à l'exception de tous les autres!""
Winston Churchill devant la Chambre des Communes le 11 Novembre 1947.
Mais la démocratie suppose un processus électoral qui respecte les cinq éléments essentiels que sont 
                             la confidentialité, 
                                       l'anonymat, 
                                                 la sincérité, 
                                                            l'unicité 
                                                                      la transparence. 
Il faut que l'électeur ait confiance dans le mode de scrutin. Que celui-ci ne semble pas entaché d'irrégularités, de fraudes, d'erreurs. Que le délai entre la fin du scrutin et la proclamation des résultats soit le plus faible possible afin de couper court à d'éventuelles rumeurs de manipulations. 
Nous sommes des citoyens, de simples électeurs comme vous. Nous sommes choqués par les fraudes avérées ou suspectées qui apparaissent à chaque élection, quel que soit le pays, ou par les délais nécessaires pour compter et recompter encore des bulletins dont le nombre ne correspond pas au nombre de votes émis...
Nous avons inventé HANNIBAL® pour offrir à chacun un outil fiable, économique et rapide, pour que chacun ait confiance dans le scrutin. 
HANNIBAL® utilise la technologie mondialement éprouvée de la lecture des codes barres. Un flash code QRCode est un langage universel, un alphabet lisible par n'importe quel lecteur de code barres. 
HANNIBAL® va simplement lire le code barres imprimé au verso du bulletin, l'enregistrer pendant que le bulletin est stocké dans l'urne et donner un résultat ordonné à l'ouverture de l'urne en réalisant un véritable dépouillement automatique. 
Sans intelligence, sans programmation, ne délivrant qu'un résultat brut sans transformation, le système ne peut être piraté. 
Sa simplicité le rend extrêmement robuste et fiable. 
Il est le pilier sur lequel peut se construire une véritable démocratie.
Nous avons besoin de chacun de vous pour nous aider à fabriquer et distribuer ce nouveau concept, mais surtout pour le promouvoir. Parlez en autour de vous. Interpellez vos représentants, les responsables politiques, professionnels, syndicaux. 
Hannibal® est également utile dans les élections professionnelles.
Cet outil ne change pas les habitudes de vote, mais est une telle innovation, et dans un domaine tellement sensible, que seul le nombre de citoyens intéressés pourra le faire adopter par les organisateurs. 
D'avance Merci.

HANNIBAL® repose sur trois éléments principaux:
1- LE BULLETIN DE VOTE
Un bulletin de vote normal, uninominal, sur lequel est écrit en toutes lettres le nom du candidat ou de la liste candidate au recto.


Ce bulletin est pré-plié afin de faciliter sa bonne introduction dans l'enveloppe par l'électeur.
Au verso est imprimé le code barres que l'urne va enregistrer comme étant un vote pour Victor HUGO. Le nom est noyé dans le nom des autres candidats afin d'obtenir un code barres peu identifiable à l'œil nu pour préserver la confidentialité du vote au cas où le code barres était subrepticement aperçu par un observateur.


                                                                      

2- L'ENVELOPPE
De taille adaptée au bulletin plié en deux, elle présente une fenêtre masquée par un volet sur sa face avant.

                      

L'enveloppe ne permet pas de connaitre son contenu et donc respecte la confidentialité du vote.
En relevant le volet, on aperçoit le code barres du candidat choisi par l'électeur:

                        
3- L'URNE:
Elle se présente comme une urne traditionnelle, dans ses dimensions et son apparence. En France, la transparence en est un caractère obligatoire depuis le 1er Janvier 1991. Pour d'autres pays, la couleur est codifiée ainsi que son opacité: Hannibal est facilement adaptable aux contingences locales.
Nous avons travaillé son design afin d'essayer de transmettre une idée de force, de stabilité mais également de dynamique. Nous espérons que c'est ainsi que vous la percevez!


                                                                   Urne de profil

                                                                 Urne de face
Sous le couvercle est fixé une boite contenant un lecteur de code barres, un système de rouleaux asservis, une mémoire permanente, un écran supérieur indiquant le nombre de votes enregistrés par l'urne (et donc le nombre d'enveloppes présentes dans l'urne), une zone résistive sur le dessus permettant d'enclencher l'avancement de l'enveloppe et un écran tactile en dessous, accessible uniquement quand l'urne est ouverte.


Urne en début de scrutin, mémoires vides, prête à recevoir les votes, vue du dessus


DÉROULEMENT DU SCRUTIN
L'électeur prend les bulletins présentés pré-pliés au bureau des scrutateurs qui contrôlent son identité et son habilitation à voter.
Dans le secret de l'isoloir, l'électeur choisit son bulletin, le plie en deux, codes barres à l'extérieur et l'introduit dans l'enveloppe.
                                               
Il introduit son enveloppe dans l'urne. Le scrutateur enclenche, par contact sur la zone résistive, l'admission de l'enveloppe par les rouleaux.


                           



                           


Un système mécanique simple soulève le volet juste avant son admission dans l'urne, découvrant ainsi le code barres visible à travers la fenêtre de l'enveloppe.
Le lecteur de code barres lit ce code et enregistre le ou les noms compris entre deux signes. Si jamais il n'arrivait pas à les lire pour une quelconque raison, l'enveloppe serait recrachée et le scrutateur devrait la rendre à l'électeur et inviter ce dernier à recommencer le processus de vote.

                                    


L'enveloppe poursuit sa route et est stockée pour un éventuel comptage manuel ultérieur (suite à une défaillance technique par exemple). Le compteur supérieur s'incrémente d'un.
A la clôture du scrutin, décidée par le président du bureau de vote, l'ouverture de l'urne bloque le système et empêche tout traitement ultérieur de bulletins de vote pirate.
L'allumage de l'écran interne permet d'accéder aux résultats, c'est à dire au nombre de fois que le lecteur a pu enregistrer chaque série de caractères. Les résultats sont présentés sous forme d'un tableau.




Le résultat est disponible immédiatement, sans doute ni erreur possibles!


Un lecteur avec écran  et sortie audio est en cours de développement. 
Tout électeur n'ayant pas de smartphone équipé d'une application de lecture de code barres peut ainsi vérifier que le code barres imprimé au verso correspond bien à son choix écrit au verso et empêche une tricherie éventuelle à l'impression des bulletins. 
Il est également équipé d'une sortie audio (casque) dont l'utilisation éteint l'écran. Ainsi, il permet aux citoyens ayant des difficultés à lire (mal-voyance, illettrisme etc...) de pouvoir choisir son bulletin en toute confidentialité. 
Même si son handicap l'oblige à recourir à une aide extérieure, celle-ci ne connaitra pas le choix du votant. 
L'handicapé est enfin traité avec le même respect que le valide. 
Sa dignité et sa liberté sont respectées.

HANNIBAL, 
the ballot you can trust !





'Democracy
is the worst form of government, except
all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.'
-Winston Churchill to the House of Commons,11th
November 1947

But a prerequisite of democracy is an
electoral process which safeguards the essential elements of the ballot.
It must be 
               Confidential
                     Anonymous
                            Tamper-proof
                                      Transparent
                                                'One man, one vote'.

The voter must have confidence in the
count. It should not be tainted with irregularity, error or fraud, and should
minimise delay between the close of voting and the declaration of the result to
prevent rumours of manipulation.

 We in 2Blokes are appalled by stories of actual or suspected
irregularities which can occur in elections in any country, and by the delays
caused by the need to count and recount ballot papers which do not correspond
with the number of votes cast. We have invented HANNIBAL to provide a reliable,
fast and economic means of ensuring confidence in the ballot.

HANNIBAL uses worldwide approved barcode
reading technology. QRCode is a universal barcode language recognised by all
barcode readers. 
HANNIBAL simply reads barcodes printed on the ballot-paper,
records them as the ballot-paper is inserted into the ballot-box, and delivers
the required result when the ballot-box is opened – true automatic scrutiny! 
The system can't be interfered with – no skill, no programming, delivering only
the raw result without frills. Its very simplicity makes it both robust and
reliable. 

We need all of you to help us manufacture
and distribute this new concept, and especially to promote it. 
Discuss it
amongst yourselves, talk to your parliamentary representatives, to people
involved in politics, to professional organisations, to trades unions. HANNIBAL
doesn't change voting patterns, but it's such a new concept in such a sensitive
area that only demand from those involved can bring about it's adoption.

Thank you in advance! 

HANNIBAL is comprised of three main
elements
1. 
The ballot paper

A normal ballot paper, on the front of which
is printed a single candidate's name with his corresponding barcode on the
back

                   

It is pre-folded for ease of insertion by
the voter into an envelope which contains a window corresponding to the barcode
on the ballot paper.

                                                                     
The barcode which the ballot box will
read contains all the candidates' names or a long sentence. The selected name barcode is thus not distinguishable to the eye of a surreptitious observer, and preserves the confidentiality of the ballot. Only the selected candidate being
identified by a # sign before, and a * sign after the name will be recorded by Hannibal.
  2. The envelope

The envelope is large enough to take the ballot paper folded in half
and contains a window  in front protected
by a flap, so that its contents are kept confidential. 

                               
When the flap is  lifted the barcode of the selected candidate
can be read.

                               

  3. The ballot box


Its shape, size and aspect are made similar to the ones used in the country. For example the french model, in which transparency is obligatory since 1991.

 
                                Ballot box in profile

                                                            
                                                                                         Ballot box from the front
Under the cover is a box containing the barcode reader, a system of
driven rollers, a  permanent memory, an
upper screen indicating the number of votes cast and thus the  number of envelopes contained by the box, a
resistive area on the top enabling the envelope  to be drawn into the box, and a touch screen below which is only
accessible when the box is  opened.


Ballot
box from above: at
the start of voting, memories clear, ready to receive votes.

 Ballot
procedure
 The
voter is given pre-folded ballot papers by the scrutinizers who check his
identity and  that he is registered to
vote. In the privacy of the voting booth, the voter selects the ballot  paper containing the name of the candidate he
wishes to vote for, folds it in two with the  barcode
on the outside and places it in the envelope.

                                                 
He inserts the envelope in the
ballot  box. The envelope is drawn into
the box by a scrutinizer using the resistive area to activate  the rollers.
 A
simple mechanical system raises the window flap as the envelope is drawn into
the box,  revealing the barcode now
visible through the window.





The barcode reader reads the code and
records the name or names marked by the # and * signs.
 If
the reader can't read the barcode, the envelope is regurgitated, and the scrutinizer
returns it  to the voter so that he can
repeat his vote.
 The
upper screen records an increment of one vote, and the envelope is stored in
case a  physical count is required later
(for example in the case of a technical breakdown).

                                      
 When
the ballot closes and the box is opened the system is automatically blocked,
and  cannot accept further ballot papers
i.e. irregular votes.
 The
activation of the lower touch screen gives access to the results, that is the
number of  times that the barcode reader
has recorded each series of characters. The results are  displayed in tabular form




 The
result is immediately available, incontestable and free from error.

 A
barcode reader equipped with a screen and headset 
is in course of development to enable a
voter who
has not got a smartphone equipped with a barcode reader app, to check that the  barcode registered by the box truly corresponds
with his choice of candidate(s). This controls and should  avoid
the possibility of fraudulent printing of the ballot paper. It will also be
equipped with  an audio socket, and when
the earpiece is plugged in, the screen will switch off. Thus voters  who are illiterate or have difficulty reading
can make a completely confidential choice.
 Even
if the voter requires assistance from a third party, the voter's choice will
not be  disclosed. 
The disabled are
treated with the same respect as the able-bodied.
 Their
dignity and their liberty are safeguarded.

The Team:



 Franck PROUX, DVM, Inventor, co-designer
I was awarded my doctorate in veterinary
science by Toulouse university in 1990,and for the last 25 years have practised
veterinary medicine and surgery, most recently close to Rouen (France, 76). As was the case
with Docteur Klein, famous french Doctor in Veterinary Medicine, “animals made a man of me”. I'm father to four boys, a man
of tomorrow's world, and it was with their future in mind that I invented Hannibal
with the aid of my colleague and friend Pascal MARALDO, in the hope that it
would standardise the democratic process the world over. Thank you for your
support!



 Pascal MARALDO, co-designer

I am graduated from the ""Trade Chamber of Paris"", manager of several compagnies since 1988, I work now near Blois (France, 41). I have invented and co-designed the DAPI (Detections of anomaly on lonely work station). I have always been involved in security of goods and people. HANNIBAL is my best project. Like my friend Franck, I am the father of 4 children and I am concerned for the respect of their dreams and convictions. Thank you for becoming with us the guardian of their rights.

This project would have never been able to come to life without our super team of involved and skilled engineers. Thank you

We do need to make a profit as a business, but our drive is not the money; the satisfaction on the faces of users that know 'this company really got it!' Someone really understood.
Risks & Challenges
 In any business there are risks. PerfectFaces faces two major risks; not receiving the needed finances for this project to succeed and not having products available in time (due to customs, EU regulations, etc.)
Completing Business Management Studies, has opened my eyes to the ups and downs of a business and most importantly how to manage and overcome them.
In-depth market research(micro and macro) has prepared the company for delays and humps on the way. We are aware of our threats and weaknesses, but also know how to use our strengths and opportunities to overcome.

    Other Ways You Can Help This is more than the money. Profits to keep us afloat is fine, but affordable make-up and satisfied customers knowing how to apply, what to apply and when is the meest belangrijk (most important). I want the world to know this.........please spread the brand; PerfectFaces.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

When I did additional research, the vet’s advice for my newly adopted Miniature Schnauzer, Sargent Pepperoni, was spot-on.

When I did additional research, the vet’s advice for my newly adopted Miniature Schnauzer, Sargent Pepperoni, was spot-on. The quality and origin of the ingredients going into commercially-available dog food just isn’t what I wanted to feed Sarge (and now his sister, Sweetie). My dogs are members of my family, and I’m often times more concerned about what I feed my dogs than what I feed myself! So I started researching the right ingredients for dog treats, developing recipes, taste testing with Sarge and his neighborhood buddies, and eventually selling my human-grade dog treats at our local farmer’s market in Buffalo, New York.The dog treats that I make at Fetch! are the highest quality treats available on the market. They’re filled with clean, wholesome ingredients; like the house made peanut butter that is ground fresh in the bakery weekly, no additives. Some of our other ingredients are things like pure pumpkin puree, sweet potato, and oat flour, and I even add nutritious fats like wild Alaskan salmon oil to the treats to help with things like keeping  your dog’s coat shiny and healthy. With flavors like Peanut Butter Goodness, Scrumptious Pumpkin, and Cheesy Bacon, your dog is bound to have a favorite (Sarge is partial to anything Peanut Butter!), and I believe that the love that I pour into baking each treat shows on the face of every dog who eats one.What had started out as a desire to feed my pup a high-quality and safe treat has turned into a passion for bringing all dogs joy through delicious treats. If other people love their dogs the way I love Sarge and Sweetie, they’ll want to feed their dogs the very best treats, too. I know each fur customer that comes by the market, and I love seeing the joy in their faces when they take a bite. We don’t cut any corners when it comes to quality, and it shows in the excitement of each dog that gets a Fetch! treat. Our mission is to provide treats that taste delicious to our (fur) customers, and are so high-quality that parents feel good about giving our treats to their dogs. The joy that we have been able to provide to the local dogs of Buffalo, New York has fueled our passion for making all dogs happy, which is why we are so excited about this campaign: if fully funded, this campaign will allow us to expand nationally and bring these treats to dogs all across the country!I have grown Fetch! out of a tiny residential kitchen, into and out of a church kitchen, and into a small production and retail space, as well have delveloped a website where our treats can be ordered and shipped nationwide, but one thing hasn’t changed: the treats are still handcrafted by me, all while still maintaining a separate full-time job. You see, the demand for Fetch! treats is increasing quickly, and I have had to turn down new business opportunities because my partner, John, and I just cannot keep up with the demand on our own. Given how much our fur customers love our treats; it is disappointing to turn down the opportunity to get our treats into the paws of even more dogs, so we want to make this expansion a reality in the name of bringing happiness to as many dogs as we can. With a little bit of funding to bridge the gap, we can develop this small local business into a large-scale operation, while still maintaining the integrity and quality of the product that our current customers have come to know and love.We are so excited about bringing these treats to more dogs, and we hope that we’ve convinced you that supporting Fetch! and investing in the nationwide expansion of our high-quality dog treats is worth your dollars! We have already taken a few steps toward expansion: my partner and co-owner John has taken over the day-to-day operations, which allows me the minimal time needed to focus on maintaining our current inventory of treats; we have identified a regional manufacturing partner, who shares our high standards for quality and integrity; and we have developed an expansion strategy, including cost estimates and marketing strategies. If our campaign is fully funded, we will be able to move forward with the remaining elements for expansion:FIRST, I will be able to contract with our manufacturing partner to produce the bulk of my packaged treats. Get this, a single 4-hour run from our manufacturer produces about the same number of treats that I made and sold LAST YEAR! Here's why you care: My business running more efficiently means less cost. Less cost means more competitive pricing. More competitive pricing means that you save, and when you save....YOU WIN! SECOND, by decreasing the amount of time I spend producing our current treat lineup, I can begin to focus more time on the really fun stuff like researching and developing new flavors, adding functional treats to our offerings and get creative with some really cool decorated cookie treats! THIRD, and most importantly, I will be able to create and continue to support multiple jobs for American workers, which is a passion of mine: I will be able to offer our current part-time bakery help full-time opportunities; I will be able to add seasonal positions; and I will also hire sales reps to increase our footprint now that we have product to sell.I have fallen in love with my little business and the joy it brings to my dog customers and their owners, and John and I are excited about the future of the company.

<p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Here's why our current water turbines need innovation!

</h2>Our modern lifestyles require an enormous amount of constant 
electricity.  But we all know that to stop destroying the Earth, we need
 to find new sources of clean and sustainable energy.   

Rivers provide the answers.

But the power plants and turbines of today only provide power by 
building huge and potentially destructive dams.  <br/><br/><i>The 
environmental impact of dams includes direct negative affects on the 
biological, chemical &amp; physical characteristics of rivers &amp; 
streams.  

</i><br/><br/>These problems are addressed in many environmental studies, like the ones conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
<br/><br/><b>Tesla's turbines will be located on the riverbed, which means it will 
not interfere with shipping &amp; the ecosystem will be mostly 
undisturbed.  There is absolutely no need to build dams.  No need to 
build flood gates &amp; no need for canals to interfere with fish 
traffic.  
</b><br/><br/><h2>What is Tesla's vision?

</h2>With your help we can provide Tomislav Tesla the freedom to create 
the TESLA HEPP system in order to provide affordable electricity to 
communities located near a river.  <p></p><p>We can also provide power to those places on Earth where there is no 
electrical grid but there is a nearby river to provide electrical power. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434011873/ahwlthkqs9vlxsgkdvwi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><b> </b><br/><p></p><p></p><h2>The TESLA HEPP Innovation

</h2>The main innovation of the TESLA HEPP is that the blades of the 
turbine are turned by the flow of water like a conveyor belt, moving 
with the current and not in a spiral motion like the blades currently in
 use.  With this solution, 100% of the current's power is collected on a
 much larger surface leading to greater efficiency.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434012199/p7tvqb9l7zkmqmyylqza.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p><p><b>Advantages of the TESLA HEPP:

    </b><br/></p><ul>
<li>Constant, sustainable and renewable system of energy production. 
</li>
<li>    Provides continuous and stable electric power without fluctuation, 24 hours a day,  365 days a year.  
    </li>
<li>100% green, environmentally friendly energy, which does not 
interrupt the river flow &amp; does not produce any harmful by-products 
or waste.  
    </li>
<li>Maintenance includes replacement of worn parts after 15-30 years of use (depending on workload &amp; working capacity)
     </li>
<li>Ensures continuous water supply without changing the river flow or 
affecting the natural water temperature ensuring it is not harmful to 
flora and fauna or the local settlements.
    </li>
<li>Has a positive effect on the carbon footprint and slows down climate change.
    </li>
<li>Creates new local jobs required for the production of the turbines 
and replacement parts in addition to the building needs, operation &amp;
 servicing.  
    </li>
<li>Enables river level control, which is an environmentally suitable solution for flood sensitive areas.

</h2>Utilizing the natural flow of a river is not a new concept. Humanity has been using it for centuries to grind seeds in water mills or developing irrigation systems to water plants &amp; farms.  

But using water to generate electricity is a much younger concept. The electromagnetic generator which was needed to do this was only patented in the 18th century by people like: Michael Faraday, Anyos Jedlik, Sir Charles Whetstone and Werner von Siemens. 

<br/><br/>Traditional hydroelectric plants use dams to elevate water levels and leverage gravity to spin turbines and generate electricity because this provides more energy than the natural current of the river. This often causes irreversible damage to nature! 

<br/><br/>The modern AC (alternative current) generator is a product of further research pioneered by Nikola Tesla who patented the first high voltage version in 1891. 

There are currently numerous research projects in progress throughout the world:

    gravitation water vortex power plant
    cross-flow turbine, Bánki-Michell turbine, or Ossberger turbine
    screw turbine
    Kaplan turbine
    Pelton wheel
    shrouded tidal turbine
    Gorlov helical turbine

</ul></div>","A hydroelectric power plant that won't damage the environment?
Yes! 

Now is your chance to support the future and be a part of affordable power revolution: contribute to the Tesla legacy now!

Support the research work the living descenant of Nikola Tesla for the next milestone of HEPP-1 river prototype!

Srpski, Magyar, Deutsch, Francais, Espanol please click here.
Tomislav Tesla's patented innovation uses the natural flow of water from rivers to produce a 
tremendous amount of clean, sustainable, and renewable electricity. 
This new Hydro Electric Power Plant (HEPP) is the long-awaited extension of 
the work achieved by Nikola Tesla, who harnessed the power of Niagara 
Falls when he launched the Tesla-Westinghouse Niagara Falls Power Plant 
in 1895.The public thinks of Nikola Tesla as the foremost pioneer in the field of 
electricity for public consumption.  But his original dream was to revolutionize the turbines of 
hydroelectric power plants. 
Check out Nikola Tesla's ""real"" story at theoatmeal.com!Now Tomislav Tesla is ready to advance these ground-breaking inventions.  Tomislav has followed in his family's footsteps by studying civil engineering and patenting his own designs - all to advance Nikola’s work by improving hydro power and offering this sustainable energy to the public.Advancing the Tesla Family dreamBecause Tomislav 100%
 committed for the Tesla family tradition and spent years working 
alongside the Danube river thinking about the future of power:
Do we really need to intrude on nature?   
Are dams that obstruct the natural flow of the water truly necessary?
How do we maintain ecological balance and cooperate with this natural power to produce electricity?What could the origin idea of my great ancestor, Nikola about the water power trough turbines? Over the years, these questions inspired several plans and now the answer is clear:The Tesla Hydroelectric Power Plant.  The Tesla HEPP-1 is a ground-breaking & patented river water turbine system! With your contribution to collect the $30,000 USD is great help to finalize the lab prototype. The 
requires measurements and analysis can be made more accurate. So the 
preparing of river prototype can be well-founded!Video: short film about the small laboratory prototype
Here's why our current water turbines need innovation!

Our modern lifestyles require an enormous amount of constant 
electricity.  But we all know that to stop destroying the Earth, we need
 to find new sources of clean and sustainable energy.   

Rivers provide the answers.

But the power plants and turbines of today only provide power by 
building huge and potentially destructive dams.  The 
environmental impact of dams includes direct negative affects on the 
biological, chemical & physical characteristics of rivers & 
streams.  

These problems are addressed in many environmental studies, like the ones conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
Tesla's turbines will be located on the riverbed, which means it will 
not interfere with shipping & the ecosystem will be mostly 
undisturbed.  There is absolutely no need to build dams.  No need to 
build flood gates & no need for canals to interfere with fish 
traffic.  
What is Tesla's vision?

With your help we can provide Tomislav Tesla the freedom to create 
the TESLA HEPP system in order to provide affordable electricity to 
communities located near a river.  We can also provide power to those places on Earth where there is no 
electrical grid but there is a nearby river to provide electrical power.  The TESLA HEPP Innovation

The main innovation of the TESLA HEPP is that the blades of the 
turbine are turned by the flow of water like a conveyor belt, moving 
with the current and not in a spiral motion like the blades currently in
 use.  With this solution, 100% of the current's power is collected on a
 much larger surface leading to greater efficiency.
Advantages of the TESLA HEPP:

    
Constant, sustainable and renewable system of energy production. 

    Provides continuous and stable electric power without fluctuation, 24 hours a day,  365 days a year.  
    
100% green, environmentally friendly energy, which does not 
interrupt the river flow & does not produce any harmful by-products 
or waste.  
    
Maintenance includes replacement of worn parts after 15-30 years of use (depending on workload & working capacity)
     
Ensures continuous water supply without changing the river flow or 
affecting the natural water temperature ensuring it is not harmful to 
flora and fauna or the local settlements.
    
Has a positive effect on the carbon footprint and slows down climate change.
    
Creates new local jobs required for the production of the turbines 
and replacement parts in addition to the building needs, operation &
 servicing.  
    
Enables river level control, which is an environmentally suitable solution for flood sensitive areas.
    Exceptionally low operational and maintenance costs. 

Tomislav Tesla’s invention is unique in the market of hydroelectric 
power plant turbines and it is protected internationally by the World 
Intellectual Property Organization, located in Geneva, Switzerland.Here is the direct link to: TESLA HYDROELECTRIC POWER PLANT WIPO 
Did you know?

Utilizing the natural flow of a river is not a new concept. Humanity has been using it for centuries to grind seeds in water mills or developing irrigation systems to water plants & farms.  

But using water to generate electricity is a much younger concept. The electromagnetic generator which was needed to do this was only patented in the 18th century by people like: Michael Faraday, Anyos Jedlik, Sir Charles Whetstone and Werner von Siemens.

<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For those who don't know about me and who have never heard of me before, well, I will say something in a simple words about me and what I do and what I stand for.     </p>
<p>My name is Bogdan Majkic and I'm from Melbourne, Australia.                                           I am very passionate Inventor who have developed or better to say designed a number of different Technologies, which some of them are ready to be Taken to commercialization and become available to general public to benefit from.  </p>
<p>I have Patented systems and some which are Patent pending and many other designs and Ideas which I like to develop and introduce to variety of different Industries and general population all around the World. I cover so many if not all different Technological backgrounds and have that ability to design, understand  and  construct. What ever it is that comes across I believe that I can improve in some way and improve it almost to maximum of its potential. </p>
<p>Also to my understanding of things and life in general every question has an answer to it and suitable solution as well. All we have to do is to spot those and act on them in the best way we can and apply those solutions, so we can make things easier for us all in all aspects of our lives and living.</p>
<p>Technology that I am working on is so unique and at the same time so advanced and important as well, that World have no seen yet such a Concepts and possibly would newer be able to come up with them if it was not for my devoted interest in those and talent to put them all together, and also to offer them to World's strongest Industries for benefit of all. </p>
<p>Generally I newer ask anyone for help in life and I don't really feel comfortable doing this Campaign, but at this moment and due to lack of support from everyone or better to say those who could make a difference, I kind of have no choice but to tray this Campaign, to see if I can collect some funds to be able to develop these Technologies that are of great importance to us all, now and on the long run and that far future. That is from my aspect and it would be from all those who would understand that same.</p>
<p>Yes I have variety of Technologies to prove and I have some images attached on this links Gallery so you are most welcome to visit and see for your self what is all about. If not please contact me direct and I will share some information's with you. There is a Hydro Generator (Solar Concentrated System and many more),  or best of all Hydro solution that will improve any Hydro Dam and efficiency of them all for example. The system is so advanced that even Hydro and Energy Industry are not sure how it will affect everything and what changes could happen if this Concept goes ahead and gets excepted. These are main reasons for lack of support in a way as Technology possibly needs to be explained and in fact developed, so we can all withes for us self's, what is all about. In order to do this I need huge funds which I don't have, so I can develop and advance the way we consume electricity for example. </p>
<p>I  have so many advanced Energy solution and other Technologies that I have worked out  which require very large funding's that I don't have. </p>
<p>I hope you good people understand my intentions and my reason for running of this Campaign. I have donated and publish some of my work to entire Humanity already, and many people are aware of what I do all around the world and I am sure that they are not shocked with this Campaign at all and that they understand my position and my greatest intentions as well for benefit of all.</p>
<p>The amount that I have placed on this campaign is just a minor cost of what I have to develop, but it would be wonderful start where I would be able to develop working models and perhaps manufacture those as well in the near future. It is not an easy process but for those that are devoted and passionate about they work it would not be hard either.</p>
<p>I was originally after Investor and people of interest in my Technologies so we can take this Technologies of the ground. In order to do that I have to develop a number of different models and prove and offer the same to  the market and variety of Industries. I have worked on Renewable Energy solutions and have so many to offer, which are as we all know so important for our Environment and our future developments and the way we will continue to power out homes. I also have those so called  Advanced Energy Solutions to offer and a number of different designs and variety of different Technologies.</p>
<p>I hope that you understand all that and that with your help we can make all this possible and if not I will continue on my own and my journey of advancing the world in the field of greatest importance.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading of this and for your understanding and you contribution in all this and if any.</p>

Thank you for reading of this and for your understanding and you contribution in all this and if any.
Regards, 
                    What We Need & What You Get
   What i need to do is to develop working models R&D on them and to start perhaps manufacturing of those same Technologies so we have a ball rolling in real direction. 
I have Hydro Generator and variety of Hydro Concepts  to develop ( costs would be around AU $ 60 000 just for working models, each), about 8-10 different Magnet motors ( around AU $50 000 for all), New Foundation which is Earthquake prove Foundation ( around AU $150 000), New Airplane/Helicopter/Space Ship (costs around AU$ 300 000), New Concentrated PV Solar Dish ( costs around AU $ 100 000) and so many other systems and Technologies to develop and to demonstrate where I would need millions in the future just like any other Org. or a Research Company and that is just for a Research (R&D) its self and demonstrations.
Once I have that starting point I would be able I believe to distribute and profit from some of those Systems and fund others as well and have it full on rolling, where we all would gain from all this in so many different ways. 
Once and if everything goes according to plans I would give back and in return regularly and randomly developed and working models to those in need all around the world,  to Universities for additional study and learning, to all of you who have seriously contribute to this Campaign and have helped me to make my dream possible and for benefit of all on a long run.
I would keep my work published and keep everyone informed of my progress and would continue to contribute again and again for advancing of out World and our Planet in a best and the most possible advanced way.  
I have those skills and I do believe in what I do as many already well know on Facebook, LinkedIn, Tweeter and some other Internet sites.
If this Campaign is not successful and some funds do get collected, all amount would be strictly invested in Technology alone and for the purpose that is designed for. It is not a easy task so I hope that you all understand my position and my true intentions here in all.
I would love to develop all those and demonstrate to all something so advanced where our children can advance and many many Generations to come benefit from my hard work and you help by Contributing to this cause.
That is kind of stuff that I do and love doing and that you would also as a general population and societies  get back in return from me. Investing in my projects is instant investing in your own future as well and at the same time and many Generations to come.
Thank you!



                                    The Impact I have explained already few things but I would say that importance of my Projects is so huge that if and when I demonstrate all those models and Technology gets developed, the entire World would be on the huge improve and so Technologically advanced that many just would not believe that was ever possible. 
I only know for sure the real importance o all my Projects. 
There were not all designed for me to profit from them but for all of Humanity to benefit from it. I have proven my point many times a specially on Facebook by sharing  of so many information and designs and helping many times many people to work out those great solutions. 
That is what kind of guy I am and what I stand for.

                          Risks & Challenges
 There are risks involved like in everything we do, but I say if its meant to be than there are no risks involved. Anything that we come across in mean time will have solution to it and I am sure of that. I like to establish a Team work as well where we can establish a  real Technological center and continue with future Research and Development (R&D) that will expend into real and Educative Program and for benefit of all new generations and students as well.
This is real and I am confident that I can develop all those and that I will, with or with our your help.

</div><div>
<p> Hairologie, the only beauty centric social network serving women of color, was founded out of the desire to locate reputable and professional stylists who were dedicated to serving the beauty needs of women of color.  Today, Hairologie, serves as a FREE first in class social media tool designed to give women of color access to all things hair.  Hairologie’s one of a kind search tool enables users to pull multiple types of media including videos, blog's and diary posts on just about anything related to hair. </p>
<p>Saana Holley, CEO and President of Hairologie, embarked upon a journey 11 years ago to develop an aesthetically pleasing and empowering application that would irrevocably change the landscape of the African American hair and beauty industry.</p>
<p>During her journey to impact the world of black beauty, Saana teamed up with Emeka Raijs, a talented User Experience Expert, who began to bring life to Saana's vision and created a rich and aesthetically pleasing application.  After facing a few setbacks and having to overcome financial loses, Saana and Emeka teamed up with Kellie P. Easton to rethink the best method to bring Hairologie to the market.</p>
<p>The team of three worked diligently, always considering the end user in mind, to create what is going to be a game changer towards the way women of color learn, discover and share all things beauty and hair.</p>

Hairologie presents the TRIPLE B (Beautiful, Black and Brilliant) Campaign.  In order to bring Hairologie to the market we're asking you to take part in the TRIPLE B Challenge by donating at least $20 in honor of a Beautiful, Black and Brilliant woman or girl you know!
In addition to providing the resources women of color need to enhance their outer beauty, at the heart of Hairologie is the inner desire to empower females of all ages to love themselves from within.  



Our Story








The Hairologie Journey


 Hairologie, the only beauty centric social network serving women of color, was founded out of the desire to locate reputable and professional stylists who were dedicated to serving the beauty needs of women of color.  Today, Hairologie, serves as a FREE first in class social media tool designed to give women of color access to all things hair.  Hairologie’s one of a kind search tool enables users to pull multiple types of media including videos, blog's and diary posts on just about anything related to hair. 
Saana Holley, CEO and President of Hairologie, embarked upon a journey 11 years ago to develop an aesthetically pleasing and empowering application that would irrevocably change the landscape of the African American hair and beauty industry.
During her journey to impact the world of black beauty, Saana teamed up with Emeka Raijs, a talented User Experience Expert, who began to bring life to Saana's vision and created a rich and aesthetically pleasing application.  After facing a few setbacks and having to overcome financial loses, Saana and Emeka teamed up with Kellie P. Easton to rethink the best method to bring Hairologie to the market.
The team of three worked diligently, always considering the end user in mind, to create what is going to be a game changer towards the way women of color learn, discover and share all things beauty and hair.
  


These answers lead to the creation of Hairologie.   
Beauty Innovation at Your Fingertips 


Hairologie users are given journals where they can record their hair journeys, keep notes regarding products and services, locate stylist, make recommendations and socialize with other Hairologie users.

<p></p>
<p><b>Furnish Out</b> is a for-profit business that raises
money for orphaned children in China. This happens in three simple steps:</p>
<p>1) We support local Chinese artisans by purchasing
from them quality, handmade furniture and home furnishings.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2) We bring those quality, handmade pieces of
furniture and furnishings back to the United States and sell them for profit.</span></p>
<p>3) We donate all of the proceeds from the sales of
those pieces to China Hope Foundation* which is a non-profit organization caring
for orphaned children in China.</p>
<p>*There are <i>no</i> administrative fees paid to anyone
involved in the operating of either Furnish Out or China Hope Foundation.</p>
<p>The <b>mission</b> of Furnish Out is to
aid orphans in Chinese foster homes through the disbursement of money from the
sale of quality, handmade furniture and home furnishings from China. </p>
<p>Our <b>vision</b> is to help provide orphaned children with what is useful and necessary to meet their financial, nutritional, spiritual, medical, and social needs; to see artisans paid a fair price for their work; and to give people the opportunity to own a quality, handmade, and unique piece of furniture or home accessory.</p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Question:<br/>
</h2>
<p>Why is Furnish Out an LLC and <i>not</i> a non-profit organization (501c3)?</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The short answer is because we don’t qualify.  The majority of our income comes from
non-business related activities and, therefore, for tax purposes we must be
established as a for-profit business. Despite being a for-profit business though, no administrative fees are paid to anyone involved with Furnish Out, and 100% of the profit made by the sale of every piece goes to charity. </p>

Each piece of furniture and each decorative accessory is made or refinished by hand using new or reclaimed wood. Each piece is unique and has a story behind it.

China Hope Foundation

China Hope Foundation is a non-profit organization (501c3) that was founded in 2009 by two people we feel lucky to call our friends. In 2011 they built and opened a foster home called Alenah's House through which they will soon begin a fostering program. In 2014, they opened the China Hope Center in Beijing which is a humanitarian aid center focusing on social work, orphan relief, counseling and training.  These are just a few of the worthwhile projects that China Hope has executed on behalf of orphaned children.

Funding
I believe in the mission of this business so much that I have put a significant amount of my own money into covering the start-up costs. I have reached a point though, that in order to continue, I need to ask for help from family, friends, and anyone else willing to help out. The $60,000 goal I have set will cover the cost of inventory for a small container (20-foot) of goods plus operating expenses for the first year.

<p><b>Phase I</b> - Launch this Indiegogo campaign to fund our start up. This involves an e-commerce site (Mpowered Life) where artisans around the world can sell their work to to the global marketplace. Through the sales of artisan works and other empowering goods we will be able to fund all of our campaigns going forward without the need for public donations. This makes our initiative self-sustainable.</p>
<p><b>Phase II </b>- Our campaigns will give us the means to continue to spread the energy of love and Empowerment to people in all corners of the world. </p>
<p><b>Phase III</b> - Empower It Forward  becomes a personal and tangible system of belief. A belief in mutual empowerment. More and more people and entities begin to believe in helping to make people's dreams come true by empowering them. <br/><br/></p>

<br/><b>In 2011, I received my first big taste of how rewarding it can be to Empower others </b>less fortunate, when I was invited by my High School Health teacher to go on a trip to the Dominican Republic, with her non-profit <a href=""http://una-vida.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Una Vida</a> (One Life in Spanish). In a small village called La Descubierta, very close to the Haitian border, we mixed cement by hand and laid concrete flooring in many of the local homes, helping to reduce the likelihood of disease caused by dirt floors. The trip was designed to give high school students an opportunity to see the great contrast of life in a developing nation. An experience uniquely designed to illustrate how blessed and fortunate we are, with hopes of planting seeds within their consciousness, that would one day grow into beautiful flowers, inspiring a life of service. A very BIG seed was planted on that trip.

                    How the Empower it Forward Project works with your support. 




""We rise by lifting others."" - Robert Ingersoll



By helping us reach our goal of $9,999 you will take part in the launch of a project that will touch the lives of many, while creating awareness, and Empowering men & women through entrepreneurial development, aiming for self-sustainability. 
Phase I - Launch this Indiegogo campaign to fund our start up. This involves an e-commerce site (Mpowered Life) where artisans around the world can sell their work to to the global marketplace. Through the sales of artisan works and other empowering goods we will be able to fund all of our campaigns going forward without the need for public donations. This makes our initiative self-sustainable.
Phase II - Our campaigns will give us the means to continue to spread the energy of love and Empowerment to people in all corners of the world. 
Phase III - Empower It Forward  becomes a personal and tangible system of belief. A belief in mutual empowerment. More and more people and entities begin to believe in helping to make people's dreams come true by empowering them. 







March: Poverty Eradication Initiative (Kiva)
The solutions to the world's greatest social issues will not come from governments or political leaders. They will come from people.
PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU.
Kiva is a non-profit organization with a mission to connect people through lending to alleviate poverty. Leveraging the internet and a worldwide network of microfinance institutions, Kiva lets individuals lend as little as $25 to help create opportunity around the world.

Access to financial solutions Empowers people living in poverty to transform their lives, their children's futures and their communities. 

Our Empower It Forward plan with Kiva: As loans are paid back, they are then re-distributed back out, further extending the reach and potential of each loan made, Empowering the lives of not one, but many entrepreneurs who need the support.

Some like it hoppy, others like it dark and malty, and some only like yellow beer. I want to create a place where beer drinkers of all kinds can come together and feel at home. A place where you do not have to feel ashamed for not knowing styles of beers or certain flavor descriptors, but at the same time I want beer nerds to be able to come in and geek it up!  That is why I am starting up Beer Scout, a Craft Beer establishment in Portland, Oregon. </p><p>At Beer Scout, we plan to provide Portland’s gigantic beer drinking community with an opportunity to experience an impressive array of local craft beers as well as beers from across the country that they can consume onsite or take to-go either by the bottle or by filling a growler.  Our goal is to have 8-10 quality craft beers, ciders, and/or meads on tap. We will be offering 100-200 different bottled beers, kept cold and ready to drink on premise or to take home and enjoy. We will also be selling and filling growlers from our taps.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>About Modern Companion</strong></p>
<p>Modern Companion aims to bring the community of pet lovers together one stylish pet product at a time. Modern Companion is currently an online pet accessory company that was created back in January 2019. When you become a part of our community, you become part of our family. Getting to know each pet and their human is something we are passionate about. We try our best to engage with our community through fun blog posts, trivia, contests, and much more on our social accounts.</p>
<p>Supporting our local community and other small businesses has been a central focus for our company. Sixty percent of the materials we use are sourced from small business manufacturers and shops. All our shirts are locally screen-printed here in South Carolina by another small business. We believe in the power of #communityovercompetition and #supportingsmallshops.</p>
<p>Modern Companion's unique modern style and mission to cater to all pets have brought the community of pet lovers together, unlike any other company. We can be seen by our local community often at the Soda City Market in downtown Columbia. </p>
<p>Over the course of two years, we have created thousands of handmade products out of our home.  We also wholesale our bandanas, scarves, and tees to over 60 small businesses in the United States.</p>
<p>We recently started partnering with other small businesses to create curated boxes full of our products and others that cater to the modern-day pet parent. This was when we started to realize how much passion we have for finding and curating products and supporting others along the way.</p>
<p>Our tiny home office is bursting at the seams! We believe it's time to share our brand and community with our local area and expand our abilities. Therefore, we are looking to open up our first retail location in Chapin, South Carolina.</p>
<p>The Modern Companion store will be an upscale pet boutique catering to all pets. It will feature all of our own products from bandanas, scarves, tees, bowties, and curated products that the pet will love and the pet parent as well. We would also love to stock our store with products created by small businesses and help them grow their brands.</p>
<p>We would love to implement other things into our store like a self-wash station and home-made treat bar. </p>
<p>We hope to open in early 2021. </p>
<p><strong>About The Owner</strong></p>
<p>Maddie St. Gelais, originally from Latham, New York, graduated from the State University of New York at Oswego back in December of 2017 with a BFA in Design. She moved down to South Carolina in 2018 and currently works as a full-time web designer aside from running Modern Companion. She is currently going back to school part-time to get her MBA in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from Clemson University.  She is a crazy pet mom that is inspired to put a new spin on pet products. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Starting up a retail location requires many upfront costs that a small business and young entrepreneur can not easily get. We will try to get some small business loans but we wanted to reach out to friends and family first!</p>
<p><strong>What your contribution will be going towards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Signage</li>
<li>Displays</li>
<li>Renovations within the store</li>
<li>Buying inventory</li>
<li>Overhead costs</li>
<li>Maintenance and Repairs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What your contribution will get you:</strong></p>
<p>We know asking for money during difficult times is a lot to ask, and we truly want to make it feel like our community helped us create our store. We want to feel like everyone ""owns"" a piece.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have created some perks for every amount you donate!</p>
<ul>
<li>$20 (A personalized thank you email from the owner and be notified first the date and location of our store)</li>
<li>$50 ( A personalized thank you email from the owner and a free bandana)</li>
<li>$80 (A personalized thank you email from the owner, free bandana, and free tee)</li>
<li>$100 (A personalized thank you email from the owner, free bandana, free tee, and personal shoutout when we go LIVE on the first day of opening)</li>
<li>$200 (A personalized thank you email from the owner, free bandana, free tee, personal shoutout when we go LIVE on the first day of opening, and VIP access to our store before everyone else)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are aware that we are currently in a pandemic with the current COVID-19 crisis and its effects on small businesses. However, we believe between our online community and in-person community, we will overcome these challenges and offer safe shopping experience for people and their pets.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We totally understand if you cannot donate. The best way to help us is to share this campaign with others to reach our goal!</p>

La totalité de la somme récoltée sera ensuite envoyé pour le paiement du chantier en Colombie.Bonne nouvelle si vous êtes une entreprise :  la tva non applicable sur le soutien financier que vous nous apporterez!La fromagerie.Notre fromagerie sera composée de caves à fromages semi-enterrées situées au sous-sol dont le coût de construction est estimé à 21.500€. Au rez-de-chaussée, un laboratoire de fabrication avec un local séparé dédié à l'emballage du fromage ainsi qu'un espace d'accueil et de vente seront construits pour un budget estimé à 25.500€.Les équipements.Si nous réussissons à dépasser l'objectif minimum, nous pourrons investir dans l'achat d'équipement pour la nouvelle fromagerie.Nous possédons déjà du matériel que nous nous sommes procuré en réinvestissant les bénéfices engendrés par la fromagerie au fil du temps. Cependant l'espace sera plus grand et notre production également, l'achat d'équipements sera donc nécessaire pour fonctionner convenablement.Entre autres: une machine à laver industrielle, une presse à fromage professionnelle, un chaudron à lait de 150 litres, des plans de travail en inox, du mobilier de stockage en bois pour les caves, des moules à fromage…Pourquoi notre fromagerie est importante?Notre projet comporte dans ses gênes une dimension sociale, politique et écologique forte.Il faut le dire, s'installer au beau milieu de la Cordillère des Andes, pour produire du fromage artisanal à base de lait cru non pasteurisé - dans un pays ne possédant pas la culture de ce type de fromage - était un pari un peu fou.Mais cette courageuse idée s’est révélée être un pari gagnant: nos fromages plaisent! De par leurs goûts à la fois doux et prononcés, leurs mélanges avec des épices colombiennes et leurs prix accessibles.Sept ans maintenant que nous prouvons qu'il est possible de travailler  ""avec et pour"" les gens du village, tout en travaillant ""avec et pour"" la nature de nos montagnes.Aujourd’hui, nous payons le lait à un meilleur prix que celui du marché traditionnel et sommes en train de convaincre les éleveurs de passer en élevage biologique en leur proposant une transition écologique douce et réalisable. Petit à petit, la vache fait son nid.À Armenia Mantequilla, nous choisissons de travailler prioritairement avec des femmes cheffes de famille, afin d'apporter une indépendance financière. Actuellement Bonne Nature fonctionne grâce à trois fromagères à la production et à l'avenir notre équipe s'agrandira.A terme, nous souhaiterions devenir une coopérative écologique et solidaire dont tous les membres tireraient des bénéfices en fonction de leur travail et investissement.Si vous ne pouvez pas nous aider financièrement, il existe d'autres moyens.Quelquefois, ce n’est juste pas possible d’apporter un soutien financier, on comprend! Heureusement une manière très efficace de nous aider est d’utiliser les outils de partage Indiegogo sur vos réseaux sociaux. L’idéal étant d’écrire une phrase de votre style (cela intéressera bien plus qu'un lien seul) expliquant pourquoi vous trouvez important de nous soutenir.En ces temps de pandémie, des mots d'encouragement, des idées, des conseils nous donneront également la force de continuer.Nous apprécierons réellement toutes les aides que vous pourrez nous apporter.Merci!L'équipe Bonne Nature. ENGLISH VERSION.Multicultural incipit.In the Andes Mountains, in the Colombian village of Armenia Mantequilla, ""Bonne Nature"" was created.Since 2014, we have been helping to develop our village by transforming the milk of the Andes cows into delicious ""colombo-french"" cheeses, worthy of the French tradition and at a price affordable to the majority of the Colombian population.A few years ago, for financial reasons we transformed half of our home into a cheese factory (when you start out you have to make do with what you’ve got, right?)But today, our dream is to build a real cheese factory - it has even become essential for us to continue to exist. We hope that this crowdfunding will help us do it: we have prepared a multitude of rewards that you will be able to receive in France as well as in many other countries!Helping us in this project means supporting bottom-up globalisation by taking part in an ambitious local farming venture that crosses borders thanks to its multiculturalism! Let’s do this! Help save Bonne Nature.Hola everyone,Our family business promotes the cultural mix between our two home countries - Colombia and France - through the creation of artisanal cheeses mixing French cheese-making know-how and products from the Colombian countryside.Our Colombian-French family, the ""MEJÍA MEJÍA"" family, was born from the union between Luz Marina and John Jairo, welcomed by France in 1991.After almost 25 years in the city of Lyon, Luz Marina decided to learn the art of French artisanal cheese and to return to Colombia to set up an organic cheese factory to help develop her native village: Armenia Mantequilla.Rich in culture, landscape and nature, our village once prospered by processing its raw materials and diversifying its agricultural activities. But the industrial revolution, the rural exodus and unbridled globalisation have all taken their toll...Bonne Nature was born out of our desire to create an inspiring ecological enterprise that would enhance local resources and that Armenia Mantequilla, Colombia and France could be proud of!Let's build ""Quesería de mi sin ti"".Our cheese factory which is also our home house no longer has enough space for our activity, nor cellars to mature our cheeses. To continue in these conditions is extremely hard on our cheese makers and is no longer economically viable.That is why our dream today is to build a real cheese factory with cheese cellars so that we can increase our production and grow.Why we need your help and where your contributions will go.A bank loan has enabled us to buy a house with some land where the new cheese factory would be built. We need your support to help us finance the construction of the cheese factory (€73,000) and the purchase of equipment (€24,000).We have calculated the crowdfunding target based on the minimum we need to continue the venture. It is important to note that after payment of the various fees, only 46,255€ of the 67,000€ target will actually go directly to the project.For more clarity and transparency, here is a little cheese (it's our specialty after all) explaining where the money will go exactly:The money will go to the bank account of ""FILO"", a charity under the law of 1901 for international solidarity, created to promote cultural links between France and Armenia Mantequilla. All of the money collected will then be sent to pay for the project in Colombia.Good news if you are a company: there is no VAT on the financial support you donate!The cheese factory.Our cheese factory will be composed of semi-buried cheese cellars located in the basement. The construction cost is estimated at 21.500€. On the ground floor, a production laboratory with a separate room dedicated to packaging of the cheese as well as a reception and sales area will be built for an estimated budget of 25.500€.Equipment.If we manage to exceed the minimum target, we will be able to invest in the purchase of equipment for the new cheese factory.We already have some equipment which we have purchased by reinvesting the profits from the cheese factory over time. However the space will be bigger and so will our production, so the purchase of equipment will be necessary in order to be able to operate properly.Among others: an industrial washing machine, a professional cheese press, a 150 litre milk cauldron, stainless steel worktops, wooden storage furniture for the cellars, cheese moulds…Why is our cheese factory important?Our project has a strong social, political and ecological dimension.It has to be said that setting up in the middle of the Andes Mountains to produce artisanal cheese made from unpasteurised raw milk - in a country with no culture of this type of cheese - was a bit of a gamble.But this courageous idea turned out to be a winning bet: our cheeses are popular! With their mild yet pronounced flavours, their mixtures with Colombian spices and their affordable prices.For seven years now, we have been proving that it is possible to work ""with and for"" the people of the village, while working ""with and for"" the nature of our mountains.Today, we pay a better price for milk than the traditional market price and are convincing farmers to switch to organic farming by offering them a gentle and feasible ecological transition.In Armenia Mantequilla, we choose to work primarily with female heads of household, in order to provide financial independence. At present, Bonne Nature is run by three women in production and in the future our team will grow.In the long term, we would like to become an ecological and solidarity-based cooperative where all members receive benefits according to their work and investment.If you can't help us financially, there are other ways.Sometimes it's just not possible to give financial support, we understand! Fortunately a very effective way to help us is to use the Indiegogo sharing tools on your social networks. Ideally, you should write a sentence of your own (it will be much more interesting than a link alone) explaining why you think it is important to support us.In these times of pandemic, words of encouragement, ideas and advice will also give us the strength to continue.We really appreciate any help you can give us.Thank you for your support!The Bonne Nature team.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Every contributor will be thanked by us and recognised for their donation but in addition, depending on the level of giving you would like to provide there are some additional fantastic perks you can choose from including: a natural soap, virtual farm visits, group farm visits, workshops on the farm, private booking of the farm, sponsorship of one of our rare breed areas (signage included), planting of trees and much more. Una vittoria per te!Avendo aiutato noi e aiutato le famiglie bisognose, c'è anche qualcosa per te. Ogni collaboratore sarà ringraziato da noi e riconosciuto per la sua donazione, ma in aggiunta, a seconda del livello di donazione che vorresti fornire, ci sono alcuni fantastici vantaggi aggiuntivi tra cui puoi scegliere: un sapone naturale, visite alla fattoria virtuali, visite di gruppo alla fattoria , laboratori in fattoria, prenotazione privata della fattoria, sponsorizzazione di una delle nostre rare aree di razza (segnaletica inclusa), piantumazione di alberi e molto altro ancora.  What We Need, What We Donate & What You Get What we need to achieve:The overall project, including solar power and some additional equipment, will cost over €170000. We have already funded some of the materials and costs and we have received €90,000 of government funding, leaving us a funding gap of €50,000 to achieve. What we will Donate:We have ample stock value of products to cover this gap, but the current pandemic is causing challenges around selling quickly enough to meet our timescales. We will therefore match all donations to help us with an equal value of food donation via recognised charities to help families in need. What You Will Get:Please take a moment to browse each of our fantastic perks and see what level of giving is right for you and which of the perks you may like to benefit from. We are also open to ideas and suggestions for the creation of tailored perks if you have something in mind... by all means ask us and we will see what is possible...   Cosa ci serve, cosa doniamo e cosa ottieni Cosa dobbiamo ottenere:Il progetto complessivo, inclusa l'energia solare e alcune apparecchiature aggiuntive, avrà un costo di oltre 170000 €. Abbiamo già finanziato alcuni dei materiali e dei costi e abbiamo ricevuto 90.000 € di finanziamenti governativi, lasciandoci un deficit di finanziamento di 50.000 € da raggiungere. Cosa doneremo:Abbiamo un ampio valore di prodotti per coprire questo divario, ma l'attuale pandemia sta causando difficoltà nel vendere abbastanza rapidamente da rispettare i nostri tempi. Pertanto combineremo tutte le donazioni per aiutarci con un uguale valore della donazione di cibo tramite enti di beneficenza riconosciuti per aiutare le famiglie bisognose. Cosa otterrai:Prenditi un momento per sfogliare ciascuno dei nostri fantastici vantaggi e vedere quale livello di donazione è giusto per te e di quali vantaggi potresti beneficiare. Siamo aperti anche a idee e suggerimenti per la creazione di vantaggi su misura se avete qualcosa in mente ... chiedeteci assolutamente e vedremo cosa è possibile ...   What if we don't make our full target?​We have committed to building this structure. We have already purchased many of the materials so it will be built although we may have to do so over a greatly extended period and at a much greater cost to the family as we will lose the government funding we have been offered.If we fail to reach our goal then we will have to seek costly finance that will put stress on all of us and risk the future of our business.Whichever way, every penny raised will be invested into improving the facilities on the farm for visitors and animals alike and every penny that is donated will be 100% matched with a food donation to the specified charities. We also guarantee the perks selected by all backers will be fulfilled! E se non raggiungiamo il nostro obiettivo completo?Ci siamo impegnati a costruire questa struttura. Abbiamo già acquistato molti dei materiali, quindi verrà costruito, anche se dovremo farlo per un periodo molto lungo e con un costo molto maggiore per la famiglia in quanto perderemo il finanziamento governativo che ci è stato offerto.Se non riusciamo a raggiungere il nostro obiettivo, dovremo cercare finanziamenti costosi che metteranno sotto stress tutti noi e rischieranno il futuro della nostra attività.In ogni caso, ogni centesimo raccolto verrà investito nel miglioramento delle strutture della fattoria per i visitatori e gli animali allo stesso modo e ogni centesimo donato sarà abbinato al 100% a una donazione di cibo agli enti di beneficenza specificati. Garantiamo inoltre che i vantaggi selezionati da tutti i sostenitori saranno soddisfatti!  Why this means so much to us:We really hope you chose and are able to support our worthwhile cause and make a huge difference both for us and also for needy families in Italy. The realisation of this project will bring together 5 years of work, effort and dreams. To be able to open our doors to schools and societies for the disabled is something we are so excited to do. We can only hope that you will be inspired by our vision and decide to support us. If you have any questions you'd like us to answer please let us know and please watch out for updates! Perché significa così tanto per noi:Speriamo davvero che tu abbia scelto e sia in grado di sostenere la nostra valida causa e fare un'enorme differenza sia per noi che per le famiglie bisognose in Italia. La realizzazione di questo progetto riunirà 5 anni di lavoro, impegno e sogni. Essere in grado di aprire le nostre porte a scuole e società per disabili è qualcosa che siamo così entusiasti di fare. Possiamo solo sperare che sarai ispirato dalla nostra visione e deciderai di sostenerci. Se hai domande a cui vorresti che rispondessimo, faccelo sapere e fai attenzione agli aggiornamenti!  If you personally find yourself unable to support financially you can still help us by spreading the word and letting others know about our story, our goals and the needs we are trying to support.Please mention us to friends, family, colleagues or use one of the tools to share it to your social media accounts.Se personalmente trovate in grado di sostenere finanziariamente si può ancora aiutarci diffondendo la parola e lasciare che gli altri conoscono la nostra storia, i nostri obiettivi e le esigenze che stiamo cercando di sostenere.Per favore, menzionaci ad amici, familiari, colleghi o usa uno degli strumenti per condividerlo con i tuoi account sui social media.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Coin Arcade Bar?</h3>
<p>Coin is a retro arcade and bar filled with professionally restored 80's and 90's arcade and pinballs featuring craft beer from regional breweries and retro inspired fresh signature cocktails.</p>
<p>Games will be .25 to .75 cents each and will featured a simple food menu to satisfy your snack craving while you drink and game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How this all began</h3>
<p>Six years ago, when our second daughter was born, I was pushing too hard at work, not sleeping (newborns, am i right?) and I wound up with a needle in my spine at 3am at Lehigh Valley Hospital. I got pretty sick and had to spent 5 days alone in a room thinking.</p>
<p>It was a big wakeup call and made me realize I needed to get my priorities in line with what made me feel alive and what I wanted to do in life. So in true 80's rebellious fashion, I booked a flight to LA to see the world and visit some friends. I ended up visiting ''82'' an arcade bar that changed my world. It was a Friday night and it was packed. No tv's, 3 bartenders and arcade games, pinballs and an amazing DJ to complete the vibe. ""This would be amazing to have back home.""</p>
<p>And that's when the seed was planted. Fast forward to November 2017, I bought my first arcade machine and was all in on a mission to open the first Arcade Bar in the Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
<p>The <strong>Lehigh Valley is growing and developing into a better city everyday</strong>. We want to be a part of this growth. We also want to help develop a market we feel needs improving. The Bar Arcade.</p>
<p>Arcades are getting harder and harder to find. The classics have basically disappeared from the public eye. Today, most of them are either collecting dust in warehouses or in the basements of collectors' homes. Let's change that!</p>
<p>This place will finally give us something to do other than to sit at the bar and drink. After all, arcade games have been found in bars since their conception. We want to provide that experience for people again. A place built by the people, for the people.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's how it breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>A tap system from Micromatic complete with glycol chilled lines (an awesome bar tap design, Mario inspired!)</li>
<li>Bar stools, chairs, places to set drinks and lounge when you are aren't gaming and want to chill</li>
<li>A pinball machine (Addams Family/ Twilight Zone) or 2-3 (Tapper, Joust, Star Wars) more arcade games</li>
</ul>
<p>The prizes:</p>

<li>Old school, Coin designed swag (bottle openers, shirts, stickers, fanny packs, coin holders)</li>
<li>Your (company) name, immortalized (plaques on bar stools, engraved bricks at the bar, sponsored arcade and pinball machines)</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! We are Lena Gosik-Wolfe and Melissa Paterson, two creative service providers who came together over a passion for three things that are really important to us. Building strong foundations in business, bringing people together with the experts they need to grow and maintain a solid business, and all things animals (dogs, cats, and guinea pigs are our particular specialty).</p>
<p>This campaign has been created to culminate our months of work creating a space online for entrepreneurs to build their business through community, commitment, and guidance. This space is a membership platform called Lumynary. It’s a place to connect with industry-leading experts whose skills and knowledge are the cornerstone to building a successful foundation for any business. Our members will have access to these experts to ask questions, create relationships and learn from them to grow their business and to get the support they need as they need it, affordably, rather than spending hours trying to Google their way through answers and potentially wasting money on the things they don’t need to focus on (right away).</p>
<p>When you contribute to our campaign you will be helping us reach, support, and deliver Lumynary to entrepreneurs around the world so that they can deliver their dreams and the passion behind their business to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $8000 in funding which we will use to help boost our efforts in reaching a wider variety of entrepreneurs. Through targeted Facebook ads, Instagram ads, and Google Adwords we hope to connect with entrepreneurs ready to get out of the Google trap and get on the court with their business through action-oriented guidance. </p>
<p>We’ve always worked with Makers and Artisans, who we love to pieces, but we also want to reach creative service owners, new startups, mom &amp; pop shops, or anyone who has a dream to run a business and who doesn’t know where to begin or is looking to discover that next step. This could be anything from hiring a team, expanding and scaling, manufacturing, wholesale and distribution or retirement. We believe that what’s next is just as important as building strong foundations.</p>

<p>Our perks for contributing are designed to have you <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong> Lumynary in your life. Here’s some of what we have lined up:</p>
<p><strong>1-Hour Critique</strong> - For every $75 donated you’ll receive a 1-hour critique of either your brand (Lena) or website (Melissa).

A critique can show you exactly where things are working, aren’t working and what steps you can take to improve your brand or website. Critiques are regularly priced at $150.</p>
<p><strong>1-Hour Video Critique for Brand + Website</strong> - For every $100 donated you’ll receive a 1-hour video critique from both Lena and Melissa. What’s better than making sure your brand is representing your business properly and ensuring that your website carries that voice forward as you sell your services? Nothing, we say!</p>
<p><strong>Discounted Year of Program Membership</strong> - For every $750 donation, you will lock in your discounted membership rate for one year. Regularly $997 (for introductory members only).</p>
<p><strong>ONE Lifetime Membership</strong> - For $2500 you will get lifetime access to Lumynary and never have to pay a monthly fee for all of the perks. As we mentioned, Lumynary members get access to experts but also guest experts and their award-winning services and programs at a discounted member-only rate. Plus access to our Pathfinder quiz, which as you evolve and grow, continues to grow with you. Our library of member-only content is curated by our amazing support staff who are available to you whenever you have a question or need support. </p>
<p>Our goal is $8000 but even if we don’t reach our goal the funds will continue to drive forward our outreach as much as possible.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lumynary is unlike any other membership service. Our experts are a part of our team and we fully believe in creating partnerships and promoting teamwork in every area of business. Without this, Lumynary would not have been born. </p>
<p>Lumynary provides access and breaks down the barriers between entrepreneur and expert. Who knew a lawyer could also be your partner in seeing your business grow? Or an SEO guru could help you understand how to get your website found in one simple interaction? </p>
<p>From our own personal years of experience, we have seen clients who implement community, commitment and take the guidance of experts to explode their businesses and their impact on the world. We have many clients who donate proceeds from their businesses to support causes close to their hearts, including ourselves. </p>
<p>Lumynary has the potential to increase these global initiatives by supporting heart-centric entrepreneurs, who understand that their WHY in business is more than just cash-flow. Without cash-flow though and a solid foundation, most will not survive and Lumynary is designed so that anyone with a dream of entrepreneurship can learn the skills to develop themselves, take the necessary actions and succeed.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our major risks &amp; challenges include member retention, expert turnover, and technical obstacles.</p>

So, members will always have a reason to stay involved in Lumynary and grow with us.</p>
<p>Expert turnover is always a risk in any business or team. We understand that our experts may decide to leave or pursue other ventures and believe that as we grow, our reputation will grow for creating a unique experience for our experts as they are compensated for their time and efforts (unlike most other memberships in the entrepreneurial space). Our aim is to always have 10 key experts and have put in place ways to ensure we have enough notice and time to replace an expert, should they decide to leave the membership.</p>
<p>Technical obstacles are faced by all modern businesses. We have many tech-savvy members on our team and are constantly looking at ways to use tech to our advantage vs. seeing it as an obstacle. We also believe through open communication with our members that we can resolve any problems and have created a solid system for support using tech and non-tech methods.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Magosh Brewing is a small craft brewery located in Kingsburg, CA. We are focused on crafting and serving fresh and delicious beer inspired by our communities cultural and agricultural roots.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Magosh Brewing was established by Josh Bakker and Magnus Olson in 2018 but dreamed of for years before.</p>
<p>In 2013, during the height of the drought, out of a combination of boredom, curiosity, and extreme thirst, we decided to try brewing our own beer. Before long we were scavenging the farm’s boneyard for anything that we could re-purpose into our home brewery. We ""borrowed"" the biggest pot we could find, ruined the kitchen stove and eventually built a home brew system out of some re-purposed kegs, an old truck wheel and a random pipe we found in our pasture. We were having a great time and others started to notice.  We have been making and sharing our brews ever since! </p>
<p>In the following years, Magnus and I have found more than a hobby in brewing beer. What had started as a curiosity indulging pastime turned into our passion and has now evolved into a business. Sharing carefully crafted beers with our friends and family never gets old.  </p>
<p>Now we want to bring the fun, intrigue, and lifestyle of craft beer to Downtown Kingsburg by opening a microbrewery.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have come a long way in realizing our dream of opening our brewery and now we want to give you, our community, an opportunity to help us realize our dream of bringing great craft beer to downtown Kingsburg. As a thank you for your support we are offering some great packages including limited edition, first run swag, amazing experiences, as well as the opportunity to purchase discounted beer. </p>

<p><strong>FOUNDERS STORY </strong></p>
<p>We are both French, coming from the same city, (Lyon), where we met each other almost 15 years ago. We both studied economics for a little while until graduation, and then we went for what society defines as a “reasonable choice” : corporate jobs, one in the advertising field, the other doing marketing. </p>
<p>After years of studying, working, travelling and mostly arguing about the definition of  happiness and ""the perfect life"", we came to the conclusion that we wanted to do something more meaningful of our lives.</p>
<p>The first decision we took was to choose freedom : we dropped our respective jobs in late 2016. In search of inspiration, Hugo left for a long travel in south America. Arthur later decided to join him and while travelling, they began to envision a project together.</p>
<p>And now the main question : How did these two guys ended up in Romania ? <br/>A couple of month after this adventure, we joined some friends in a trip to Romania. We spent the last days in the capital and we immediately loved Bucharest’s spirit : its organized mess, its really nice districts and parks, its people and also its nightlife ! On our last day, after a long night (or a really short one), we stopped for a coffee before getting to the airport… There and Then we began to make plans, agreeing that it would be the perfect city to settle and start something.</p>
<p>Two months later, we returned to Romania. We found a student house, where we decided to stay for a few weeks. While being there, we saw the potential of the space and realized it was the ideal place we had been looking for. We found the opportunity to take it over in May 2018, and three months later we began Vine 21’s adventure!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>The main challenge we are facing now, is to get funded in order to finish our co-working and coffee shop concepts. If we don't reach our goal of $ 25,000, some aspects of the project could be delayed.</p>
<p>We will in any case be able to open the co-working by September 2019, with at least the ground floor and first floor working areas ready. But the opening of the coffee shop may take place a bit later : by November-December 2019, or early 2020. </p>

Regarding the equipments, we'll work with a Lamarzocco machine for the espresso part  : Espressos, cortado, cappuccino, latte, flat white...We'll also offer brewed coffee : V60, Aeropress, Chemex.
Beside that, we'll offer a wide range of teas, juices, sodas, craft beers and wine, as well as some snacks (wraps, sandwiches, salads), and even desserts (cakes, cookies, sweets).


On the top part : Working area with 3 private desks, a shared long table, a meeting/projection room.On the bottom part : The coffee shop with the bar on the right side, seats on the left and on top of the bar.
Left side : Small kitchen and relaxation area.Right side : Private office.
 
WHAT DO WE NEED THE MONEY FOR ?
If you help us achieving our goal, we will use the money to develop our new Co-working space and Coffee Shop area :
$ 10.000 - Our first goal : A set of 12 designed furnitures (wood and metal)  for the co-working space, designed by Oblic Studio and built by Nod Makerspace : An 8 persons desk, a 3 private desks module, a locker furniture, some tables for the coffee shop area.
$ 15.000  - A second step : The set of 12 designed wooden furnitures + Creation of 2 designed spaces : Meeting/projection room, a private office at the 1st floor
$ 20.000 - Amazing ! : All the designed wooden furnitures + Creation of 4 designed spaces : Meeting/projection room, a private office at the 1st floor, a relaxing area, a small kitchen spot
$ 25.000 or more - Unbelievable ! : All the designed wooden furnitures + Creation of the 4 designed spaces + the furnitures, machines & materials/tools for the coffee shop : the bar, coffee grinders, coffee tools, crockery, etc.

FOUNDERS STORY 
We are both French, coming from the same city, (Lyon), where we met each other almost 15 years ago. We both studied economics for a little while until graduation, and then we went for what society defines as a “reasonable choice” : corporate jobs, one in the advertising field, the other doing marketing. 
After years of studying, working, travelling and mostly arguing about the definition of  happiness and ""the perfect life"", we came to the conclusion that we wanted to do something more meaningful of our lives.
The first decision we took was to choose freedom : we dropped our respective jobs in late 2016. In search of inspiration, Hugo left for a long travel in south America. Arthur later decided to join him and while travelling, they began to envision a project together.
And now the main question : How did these two guys ended up in Romania ? A couple of month after this adventure, we joined some friends in a trip to Romania. We spent the last days in the capital and we immediately loved Bucharest’s spirit : its organized mess, its really nice districts and parks, its people and also its nightlife ! On our last day, after a long night (or a really short one), we stopped for a coffee before getting to the airport… There and Then we began to make plans, agreeing that it would be the perfect city to settle and start something.
Two months later, we returned to Romania. We found a student house, where we decided to stay for a few weeks. While being there, we saw the potential of the space and realized it was the ideal place we had been looking for. We found the opportunity to take it over in May 2018, and three months later we began Vine 21’s adventure!
 

RISKS & CHALLENGES
The main challenge we are facing now, is to get funded in order to finish our co-working and coffee shop concepts. If we don't reach our goal of $ 25,000, some aspects of the project could be delayed.
We will in any case be able to open the co-working by September 2019, with at least the ground floor and first floor working areas ready. But the opening of the coffee shop may take place a bit later : by November-December 2019, or early 2020.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

When they looked at their city of Austin, they saw members of our community dealing with high levels of stress, anxiety, and trauma. Jyl and Alison believed in the power of yoga and mindfulness to heal and transform our community.And so, with the mantra of sharing the practice, Community Yoga Austin was born.</div><div>
<b><br/></b>
<p><b>Mission and Programming</b><br/></p>
<p>The mission of Community Yoga Austin is to offer the practices of yoga,
mindfulness and other evidenced-based wellness programming to Austin-area communities, some of whom may not otherwise have access. Our purpose and
commitment is to facilitate personal empowerment and social change by unlocking
the inherent value of our communities. </p>
<p>Our current programs target at-risk populations in the Austin
community, including prison inmates and K-12 schoolchildren from underserved
areas. Our elementary and middle school program helps children practice mindfulness
while developing essential skills for a lifetime of health and wellness.
Our high school youth wellness program provides yoga therapy to at-risk teens,
many of whom have experienced significant loss, trauma, abuse and/or neglect in
their lives. Instructors take a clinical, mindfulness-based approach to help these youth manage their personal wellness on multiple levels and integrate yoga,
relaxation training, stress reduction, anger management and life skills.
Through the prison yoga program, we work to establish connections with men and women
at the Travis County Correctional Complex (TCCC), who have been physically severed from
the larger community, and welcome them into — at the very least — the yoga
community. By sharing the discipline of yoga with them, they are offered a tool
that can help them to break cycles of violence, addiction, and negative-thinking.</p>
<p><b>We Need Your Help!</b><br/></p>
<p>Community Yoga Austin is making a difference in the lives of hundreds
of Austinites, and we need the support of the larger Austin community to
continue this important work. We are 100% reliant on donations, and at this
point, we are facing a cash shortfall. We would like to raise $15,000 – enough
to fund five full months of programming for current school and prison participants.</p>
<p>But that’s not all. We have a far grander vision. We believe that
every person in the Austin community – regardless of age, school district, or
socio-economic status – should have the opportunity to benefit from yoga and
mindfulness training. We want to expand our programming to <i>every</i> school and
prison in the Central Texas area. We want to explore partnerships with
other non-profit organizations to bring services to other members of the
community, including working professionals, senior citizens, substance abuse recovery thrivers and the chronically
homeless. But, unfortunately, right now our grand vision is stalled as we try to keep our
current programs afloat financially. By contributing to this IndieGogo
campaign, you will not only help us to meet imminent funding needs, you
will also build a foundation upon which Community Yoga Austin can expand to
serve the entire Austin community.</p>
<p>We invite you to join us in this effort. Gifts of all sizes can make a
difference, and we have yoga-rrific perks, including passes to exclusive yoga
classes, online courses, training programs -- even hugs! You can also support us by getting the word out and sharing this
campaign with your friends. We are a community organization, and we need the
help of many in order to <b><i>Build the Community</i></b> and <b><i>Share the Practice</i></b>. </p>

<p><b>Unity Outfitters</b> is a fair trade fashion brand starting up in Raleigh, North Carolina. We seek to design and produce apparel and jewelry using sustainable materials from artist groups around the world. Unity Outfitters’ mission is to give a platform to women &amp; indigenous artisan groups who produce culturally and socially significant work.  Our promise to you is to engage in traceable production using the highest quality materials available while supplying beautifully crafted designs.<br/></p>
<p>The funding from this campaign will allow us to work with our first partner, Casa Flor Ixcaco, a women’s weaving cooperative in Guatemala. Through volunteer, retail, and sourcing experience I (Katina) have been involved with this weaving cooperative for four years, and I wish to further develop this partnership to include design and production using fair trade principles. Through this work that will comprise Unity Outfitters’ first collection,  we will contribute to the revitalization of hand spun organic cotton and the use of natural dyes. This collection will feature beautiful textiles produced through the Mayan tradition of backstrap weaving.</p>

<p><b>We believe that the promotion of and investment in fair and sustainable 
fashion is desperately needed to replace the toxic fast fashion 
industry. </b>Through funding Unity Outfitters you are taking a stand 
against the negative impacts to people and the planet caused by this 
industry, and you are supporting a positive change in the way the 
fashion world works. We  create stylish and fairly and extremely well 
made products using the highest quality natural materials. Our customers
 will love wearing these garments and feel good about buying them, too.</p>
<p><b>Right now we are in Guatemala working directly with Casa Flor Ixcaco to develop the fabric which will be used to produce our samples for next summer's collection.</b><br/></p>

operation with over a 
decade of experience working in the textiles and apparel industry in 
every position from pattern-making, quality assurance, design, and 
product development, to wholesaling, sourcing, merchandising and retail, and right now we are working overtime to make this dream happen. With great success over this past year selling an extremely limited product offering at local markets, we are seeking to expand and we know that the demand is there. Our vision is to one day 
become a worker owned cooperative, and we want to employ artists and 
workers in the USA who will earn a fair wage and be provided dependable 
work. Several talented women in the USA  are on-board and eager to work 
with us on this project; we just need the funding to start-up an 
organization that can pay everyone fairly for their work.<br/>
<p></p>
<p>By 
raising $20,000, Unity Outfitters will have the opportunity become a 
thriving business in the USA with worker-owners who care about fair 
trade, and are cared for by their workplace and community  in return. 
This money will allow Unity Outfitters to form and  grow partnerships 
with artisan groups worldwide under the principles of fair trade and 
provide fair pay in exchange for their top quality work as well.</p>
<br/><p><b>For your support in helping launch our business</b>, we offer you the chance to own a piece from our Winter 2015 pre-collection. This limited collection is being hand-made by members of the cooperative and Unity Outfitters and sold to raise money for our first official collection to be produced in the spring/summer of next year. This collection includes gorgeous fair trade jade jewelry, shawls, and a bag which will all be offered in multiple different colors.

We understand that there can always be unforeseen difficulties that come up, and timing is a risk involved in all fashion production processes.  We are aware that delays may happen during production in Guatemala, in the USA, or during the shipping process. Our campaign supporters will be kept well informed during each stage of our production process so they know exactly where their rewards are and how our project is progressing. Our practice of fair trade principles extends beyond production to our customer service, and we will ensure the products we make and service we provide will please our customers.</p> </div>

If we do not meet our fundraising goal, all funded perks will still be delivered, and we will do our best to continue to produce this line.  If we exceed our funding goals, we will celebrate and sleep easier at night knowing we have the financial ability to make our dream happen.

operation with over a 
decade of experience working in the textiles and apparel industry in 
every position from pattern-making, quality assurance, design, and 
product development, to wholesaling, sourcing, merchandising and retail, and right now we are working overtime to make this dream happen. With great success over this past year selling an extremely limited product offering at local markets, we are seeking to expand and we know that the demand is there. Our vision is to one day 
become a worker owned cooperative, and we want to employ artists and 
workers in the USA who will earn a fair wage and be provided dependable 
work. Several talented women in the USA  are on-board and eager to work 
with us on this project; we just need the funding to start-up an 
organization that can pay everyone fairly for their work.

By 
raising $20,000, Unity Outfitters will have the opportunity become a 
thriving business in the USA with worker-owners who care about fair 
trade, and are cared for by their workplace and community  in return. 
This money will allow Unity Outfitters to form and  grow partnerships 
with artisan groups worldwide under the principles of fair trade and 
provide fair pay in exchange for their top quality work as well.
For your support in helping launch our business, we offer you the chance to own a piece from our Winter 2015 pre-collection. This limited collection is being hand-made by members of the cooperative and Unity Outfitters and sold to raise money for our first official collection to be produced in the spring/summer of next year. This collection includes gorgeous fair trade jade jewelry, shawls, and a bag which will all be offered in multiple different colors. Once you order your perk I will contact you to discuss what colors/styles/metals you want your perk to be produced using. (Scroll down to see more images from the collection.)

Color Options for Naturally Dyed Products
Risks - The main reason we have chosen to start up Unity Outfitters with our partnership in Guatemala is that we have been working with them for over four years, we have a good relationship established, we work well together, and we know their production process well. We understand that there can always be unforeseen difficulties that come up, and timing is a risk involved in all fashion production processes.  We are aware that delays may happen during production in Guatemala, in the USA, or during the shipping process. Our campaign supporters will be kept well informed during each stage of our production process so they know exactly where their rewards are and how our project is progressing. Our practice of fair trade principles extends beyond production to our customer service, and we will ensure the products we make and service we provide will please our customers. 
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING OUR WORK!!!The money we are raising will help cover our production costs, material costs, travel costs, website set-up costs, design work, marketing, and sales costs,  It takes a lot financial resources and hard work to launch a business like this using fair trade principles.  The good news is that once a business like ours gets started, it becomes self sustainable. If we do not meet our fundraising goal, all funded perks will still be delivered, and we will do our best to continue to produce this line.  If we exceed our funding goals, we will celebrate and sleep easier at night knowing we have the financial ability to make our dream happen. We need your help to get this project off the ground and appreciate your supporting our work!  Other Ways You Can Help

How's a Watermelon Lemonade with a 115 mg caffeine kick sound, or maybe an energized black tea with orange and lemon juices and a splash of honey?</p><div>
<p><b>How does MOONSHOT make the best tasting energy drink by a mile?</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1338007/files/20150330020703-Strip_3.png?1427706423"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>When was the last time you had a truly refreshing and delicious energy drink with no funky aftertaste? Did you even think it was possible after sucking down cans of battery acid for the past 20 years? We at MOONSHOT are serious about what we do. To do an energy drink right; absolutely right, my gawd this tastes so good right, you need to master the craft and science of flavors. It doesn't happen overnight or even over months, and it can't be done cheaply. REPEAT, it can't be done cheaply.</span></p>
<p>Our ingredient costs for the best energy drink made are at LEAST 3x greater than the mass market brands and that plays a very large part in being able to craft 6 amazing lightly carbonated energy drink beverages. Why do we use premium ingredients like 30% juice (not 5%, not 15%, but 30%), pure cane sugar and real honey in our drinks? Maybe it's because we aren't led by a guy who makes decisions based on excel spreadsheets; or maybe it's because we drink this stuff, we believe in this stuff and this stuff makes us happy. No doubt about it; when you use better ingredients, you can craft a better drink whether it's a premium craft energy drink like MOONSHOT or a premium craft beer.</p>
<p>With our premium ingredient costs, you would think we'd cost much more than other energy drinks; but nope, we are right in line with the cheaply made junk stocking shelves everywhere. It's possible/probable that we charge too little for our Premium MOONSHOT energy drink but also it just might be that the mass market brands charge way too much for their artificial cans of HoooHa.</p>
<p><b>Your contributions are great, but what we really need is your help introducing MOONSHOT to your social circle</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1338009/files/20150330020826-Strip_4.png?1427706506"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We really hope everybody has watched at least some of the video testimonials (they are entertaining to watch in an Anthony Bordainesque kind of way). It should be readily apparent that the one common denominator amongst people who love MOONSHOT is they have nothing in common. You can like energy drinks, hate energy drinks, hate sodas, only drink water; be an athlete, a geek, a hippie, a musician, an engineer, a guy, a girl, young or old. If you breathe, you will probably like MOONSHOT. If you like caffeine, then almost certainly you will LOVE MOONSHOT.</p>
<p>We ask you be the hero in your social group and be the ONE that introduces friends to MOONSHOT Premium Energy. Blast our IGG campaign link on facebook / twitter / instagram etc. and you may be surprised by how many hugs and thanks you receive down the road. Liberating one's gut from cheap HoooHa after drinking it for 20 years is a beautiful thing.</p>

<p><span>Oh yes we can and yes we are. If drinking a can of HoooHa enables you to run a 4.4 40 and Bench 405lbs, drinking a 115 mg caffeine MOONSHOT will enable you to do the same. The only difference being you won't have a sour pucker face and your gut (and bowels) will be thankful you chose premium MOONSHOT. Also, we do use 2 Quality Control Laboratories to keep an eye on things (we can be quite anal about quality at MOONSHOT). What you see on the label is what is in the bottle, rest assured.</span></p>

Each of our 6 flavors is crafted from scratch using their own set of premium ingredients. For example, our #4 Honey Peach flavor uses real honey... surprise!<p> </p>
<p>If you try our #1 Sour Apple, you may think MOONSHOT is a tangy and sweet carbonated cider-like drink with an edge. If you try our #5 Coconut Pineapple, you may think MOONSHOT is a sweet tropical soda with coconut and pineapple flavors that explode in your mouth. MOONSHOT has 6 very different flavor profiles, but regardless of the flavor, MOONSHOT never tastes like HoooHa!</p>

<p><span>MOONSHOT will always be an energy beverage line that incorporates meaningful amounts of fruit juice and fruits have fruit sugar calories. For our current line of 30% juice MOONSHOT, the fruit juice component alone contributes roughly 13 grams of fruit sugars which roughly equate to 52 calories. In other words, before we add anything else, our MOONSHOTs start at 13 grams of sugar and 52 calories due to  the juice. We have 1 diet flavor (#6 Lite Pomegranate) which contains 30% juice, a bit of cane sugar and stevia, and it is a 90 calorie drink.</span></p>

<p><b>Statement on why we chose to use synthetic caffeine over ""natural"" caffeine in MOONSHOT and therefore do not claim to be 100% all natural</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1335323/files/20150329021407-Strip8.png?1427620447"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The only ingredients in MOONSHOT that are not natural are the synthetic caffeine and vitamin B6. On a weight or volume basis, MOONSHOT is comfortably 99.999% natural. So why not just drop the B6 and swap out the synthetic caffeine with ""natural"" caffeine? Any marketer would do this in a heartbeat because having a 100% all natural claim is a marketer's dream. However, I only want the best for it -and my body- and my scientific background tells me the best energy drink requires synthetic caffeine. Why is synthetic better in this case?</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical grade synthetic caffeine has a purity that is consistent regardless of supplier or external environmental factors. It doesn't matter if there are swarms of diseased locusts or if a plant fungus is striking down crops. It doesn't matter if there is a drought or if there is a flood. Farm pesticides and water supply purity are never a concern. The lab can and will consistently output the same pure grade of caffeine day and night 365x7.</p>
<p>Now on the other hand, let's think about ""natural"" caffeine for a minute. Does one just cut down some coffee plants and wave a finger and suddenly the plants let out a ""natural"" super purified 99.99% caffeine dust like magic? Nope, it doesn't work that way. The irony with ""natural"" caffeine is you need to use very ""unnatural"" processes (that sometimes require solvents) to get the caffeine out of the plant and then other ""unnatural"" processes to purify this extraction liquid. There are variances in methods from supplier to supplier that leave many questions unanswered. Therefore (for the time being), I choose the better purer option for MOONSHOT, synthetic caffeine. --- MOONSHOT John</p>
</div></div>","The best energy drink on the market now available at Amazon and Texas H-E-B's ""Devastatingly good"", ""delicious"", ""amazing"", ""way better"",... MOONSHOT destroys standard HoooHa energy drinks. We chose the International SXSW 2015 Music + Tech conference in Austin, TX to introduce MOONSHOT Premium Crafted Energy to movers, shakers and party goers alike coming from across the nation and internationally. The testimonials you see in our video are real and unfiltered and straight from the streets.After 9 days and over 1,200 samplings of MOONSHOT Premium Energy drinks, NOBODY chose Monster or Red Bull over MOONSHOT when asked which energy drink they prefer... NOBODY. We're talking NONE, NADA, NYET, NINGUNO, GOOSE EGG. Think 1998 Yankees vs. the Bad News Bears... Michael Jordan in his prime versus you in flip flops... Fat Albert versus a slice of cake. All 3 energy drinks have the same 115 mg caffeine per 12 oz (along with Taurine & B Vitamins), but only MOONSHOT dominates with a devastatingly delicious natural taste with NO chemical aftertaste. Why we launched an IGG campaign for MOONSHOT MOONSHOT is a bottled carbonated energy drink that comes in 6 delicious fruit flavors. We are a real company doing real business at retail stores, bars & restaurants nationwide since 2013. To better meet our ever growing demand, we felt it necessary to introduce a more portable option; and thus, we are launching our companion 12 oz Sleek aluminum can line.Production for our #3 Orange Grapefruit and #5 Coconut Pineapple flavors has begun. These flavors serve as the reward perks for this campaign and the perks will be delivered regardless of the campaign goal being met. Reaching the $60,000 campaign goal will allow us to put 2 more flavors into production (#1 Sour Apple and #2 Tart Cherry).Please view our testimonials; we know you want our ""tastes fucking awesome"" #2 Tart Cherry. If we hit $60,000, then we will make it rain tart cherry for you. If we get to $120,000 then all 6 flavors will go into production and getting your favorite MOONSHOT will only be a clickity click away on Amazon. Hitting the $120K stretch goal will also allow us to accelerate R&D on our next 3 flavors  (-which you can suggest with a $7 perk contribution-). How's a Watermelon Lemonade with a 115 mg caffeine kick sound, or maybe an energized black tea with orange and lemon juices and a splash of honey?
How does MOONSHOT make the best tasting energy drink by a mile?

When was the last time you had a truly refreshing and delicious energy drink with no funky aftertaste? Did you even think it was possible after sucking down cans of battery acid for the past 20 years? We at MOONSHOT are serious about what we do. To do an energy drink right; absolutely right, my gawd this tastes so good right, you need to master the craft and science of flavors. It doesn't happen overnight or even over months, and it can't be done cheaply. REPEAT, it can't be done cheaply.
Our ingredient costs for the best energy drink made are at LEAST 3x greater than the mass market brands and that plays a very large part in being able to craft 6 amazing lightly carbonated energy drink beverages. Why do we use premium ingredients like 30% juice (not 5%, not 15%, but 30%), pure cane sugar and real honey in our drinks? Maybe it's because we aren't led by a guy who makes decisions based on excel spreadsheets; or maybe it's because we drink this stuff, we believe in this stuff and this stuff makes us happy. No doubt about it; when you use better ingredients, you can craft a better drink whether it's a premium craft energy drink like MOONSHOT or a premium craft beer.
With our premium ingredient costs, you would think we'd cost much more than other energy drinks; but nope, we are right in line with the cheaply made junk stocking shelves everywhere. It's possible/probable that we charge too little for our Premium MOONSHOT energy drink but also it just might be that the mass market brands charge way too much for their artificial cans of HoooHa.
Your contributions are great, but what we really need is your help introducing MOONSHOT to your social circle

We really hope everybody has watched at least some of the video testimonials (they are entertaining to watch in an Anthony Bordainesque kind of way). It should be readily apparent that the one common denominator amongst people who love MOONSHOT is they have nothing in common. You can like energy drinks, hate energy drinks, hate sodas, only drink water; be an athlete, a geek, a hippie, a musician, an engineer, a guy, a girl, young or old. If you breathe, you will probably like MOONSHOT. If you like caffeine, then almost certainly you will LOVE MOONSHOT.
We ask you be the hero in your social group and be the ONE that introduces friends to MOONSHOT Premium Energy. Blast our IGG campaign link on facebook / twitter / instagram etc. and you may be surprised by how many hugs and thanks you receive down the road. Liberating one's gut from cheap HoooHa after drinking it for 20 years is a beautiful thing.

What will the Sleek 12 oz cans artwork look like?

For reference, below is our bottle line that has been going strong since 2013. 
 Our can line will have the artwork seen below.

With an amazing taste like this, can MOONSHOT really be an energy drink?

 
Oh yes we can and yes we are. If drinking a can of HoooHa enables you to run a 4.4 40 and Bench 405lbs, drinking a 115 mg caffeine MOONSHOT will enable you to do the same. The only difference being you won't have a sour pucker face and your gut (and bowels) will be thankful you chose premium MOONSHOT. Also, we do use 2 Quality Control Laboratories to keep an eye on things (we can be quite anal about quality at MOONSHOT). What you see on the label is what is in the bottle, rest assured.
 
What does MOONSHOT taste like? In the testimonials, everybody raves about it being the best tasting energy drink but the descriptions seem all over the map.
 
We are not your typical mass produced energy drink that takes the base formula and just squirts in some artificial fruit flavor du jour and calls it a ""new"" drink flavor. Each of our 6 flavors is crafted from scratch using their own set of premium ingredients. For example, our #4 Honey Peach flavor uses real honey... surprise! 
If you try our #1 Sour Apple, you may think MOONSHOT is a tangy and sweet carbonated cider-like drink with an edge. If you try our #5 Coconut Pineapple, you may think MOONSHOT is a sweet tropical soda with coconut and pineapple flavors that explode in your mouth. MOONSHOT has 6 very different flavor profiles, but regardless of the flavor, MOONSHOT never tastes like HoooHa!
Why MOONSHOT will never produce a 0 calorie or 1 calorie drink

 
MOONSHOT will always be an energy beverage line that incorporates meaningful amounts of fruit juice and fruits have fruit sugar calories. For our current line of 30% juice MOONSHOT, the fruit juice component alone contributes roughly 13 grams of fruit sugars which roughly equate to 52 calories. In other words, before we add anything else, our MOONSHOTs start at 13 grams of sugar and 52 calories due to  the juice. We have 1 diet flavor (#6 Lite Pomegranate) which contains 30% juice, a bit of cane sugar and stevia, and it is a 90 calorie drink.

<p>Legalization of the world's most valuable medicine is sweeping the nation, and that's a very good thing. But in the great green rush that is taking place, some have lost sight of cannabis' connection to spirituality, as it helped manifest many of the world's greatest religions, a fact that has been suppressed for centuries.</p>After I organized the first Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, I felt an obligation to study the long history of cannabis as a sacrament, a voyage that started with the oldest living religious document, The Rig Veda.<br/><br/>I quickly discovered the central sacrament in the Veda was called ""Soma"" and ""healed all who are sick, the blind see, the lame walk...a sage and a seer inspired by poetry."" I knew immediately Soma was cannabis and milk (and not mushrooms like the mainstream claimed). I was also struck by the similarity of Soma's powers with the initial miracles of Jesus, and soon deduced cannabis played a role in those as well. In fact, Shiva, Buddha, Isis and Dionysus and many more gods and goddesses have strong ties to cannabis.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Finding my religion<br/>
</h3> <p>So after 30 years of intensive study, I did my best to construct a corruption-free form of spirituality that respects all non-violent traditions and seeks to blend them all in order to break the current hoodwink that manufactures war for profit by pitting religions against each other in an endless cycle of violence.</p>
<p>The funds collected will be used to purchase a property in Colorado, ideally an existing church that can immediately be transferred into a house of worship where cannabis can be consumed by adults.</p>
<p>If the funds I receive are insufficient to purchase such a property, I will rent a large house and invite the contributors to a ceremony on the premises. I will seek advice from my sponsors on when and where this ceremony should be held.<br/></p>
<p>If you pledge $10 to this cause, you will be invited to the opening of the lodge, which will include a great feast and entertainment from notable cannabis celebrities. But if you pledge $420, you'll be a part of those Opening  Ceremonies and will be invited to sign the official membership book and receive a golden pin that confers lifetime membership in the lodge and guaranteed admission to any and all ceremonies at any Pot Illuminati lodges around the world.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The need for peace enlightenment<br/>
</h3> <p>Today many children are raised on a steady diet of junk food, violence programming and synthetic pills. As a result, we are awash with school shootings, suicides and opiate addiction, while the entire country is bordering on PTSD. The media cartel is not helping by force-feeding so much emotionally-charged coverage of tragic events as the unfold. Peace ceremonies are a step in the right direction in seeking an antidote to excessive violence, and cannabis can be an effective tool in breaking opiate addiction and healing PTSD.<br/></p>
<p>After years of study, I've concluded North American peace culture got its start in Congo Square, New Orleans, which is also where cannabis was first instituted as a ceremonial tool on this side of the globe. The key elements of North American peace culture are improvisation and inclusivity.</p>
<p>I recently published a book titled ""Magic, Religion &amp; Cannabis"" that explains my voyage of discovery that led me to attempt to solve the religion problem by inventing a religion with no dogma. We do have one basic rule, however: don't hurt anybody.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Manifesto of the Pot Illuminati<br/>
</h3> <p> <i>Devoted to the Welfare of the World</i>
</p>
<p>Cannabis has been a constant provider of human 
welfare throughout humanity’s long journey. The time has come for the 
Pot Illuminati to gather and take our place as stewards of cannabis. We 
seek to help dissolve the oppressive laws against our sacrament. We also
 seek to harness the power and energy of cannabis for the welfare of the
 world.</p>
<p>We have long celebrated the great gifts this unique
 plant offers such as medicine, food, fuel, paper, cordage, paints, 
plastics as well as the sacramental key to higher realms of 
consciousness (if used wisely and in moderation). We have patiently 
waited for humanity to awaken from the ignorance caused by forgetfulness
 and many of our members have suffered great persecution just for their 
acknowledgement and love for the many blessings cannabis has bestowed 
upon us.</p>
<p>But we now stand at the threshold of a great cannabis reawakening, a phoenix rebirth of the mighty healing spirit of cannabis. The Pot Illuminati, as faithful stewards and advocates of cannabis, claim our right to determine, shape and protect the future of cannabis from state and corporate domination and exploitation.</p>
<p>The Pot Illuminati Lodge is a non-political entity 
that embraces all people regardless of race, religion or national 
origin. We seek to blend all the great religions, many of which have 
been perverted to manifest war for profit.  We also seek to disarm the 
dark lords who support Prohibition and we will do this by stealing their
 sigils, their names, their totems, and bending them all to our 
vibrations of peace and respect for Mother Earth.</p>
<p><strong>The Pot Illuminati Grand Lodge: Rules and Dogmas</strong></p>

</div></div>","Cannabis and enlightenment
Legalization of the world's most valuable medicine is sweeping the nation, and that's a very good thing. But in the great green rush that is taking place, some have lost sight of cannabis' connection to spirituality, as it helped manifest many of the world's greatest religions, a fact that has been suppressed for centuries.After I organized the first Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, I felt an obligation to study the long history of cannabis as a sacrament, a voyage that started with the oldest living religious document, The Rig Veda.I quickly discovered the central sacrament in the Veda was called ""Soma"" and ""healed all who are sick, the blind see, the lame walk...a sage and a seer inspired by poetry."" I knew immediately Soma was cannabis and milk (and not mushrooms like the mainstream claimed). I was also struck by the similarity of Soma's powers with the initial miracles of Jesus, and soon deduced cannabis played a role in those as well. In fact, Shiva, Buddha, Isis and Dionysus and many more gods and goddesses have strong ties to cannabis.
  Finding my religion
 So after 30 years of intensive study, I did my best to construct a corruption-free form of spirituality that respects all non-violent traditions and seeks to blend them all in order to break the current hoodwink that manufactures war for profit by pitting religions against each other in an endless cycle of violence.
The funds collected will be used to purchase a property in Colorado, ideally an existing church that can immediately be transferred into a house of worship where cannabis can be consumed by adults.
If the funds I receive are insufficient to purchase such a property, I will rent a large house and invite the contributors to a ceremony on the premises. I will seek advice from my sponsors on when and where this ceremony should be held.
If you pledge $10 to this cause, you will be invited to the opening of the lodge, which will include a great feast and entertainment from notable cannabis celebrities. But if you pledge $420, you'll be a part of those Opening  Ceremonies and will be invited to sign the official membership book and receive a golden pin that confers lifetime membership in the lodge and guaranteed admission to any and all ceremonies at any Pot Illuminati lodges around the world.
  The need for peace enlightenment
 Today many children are raised on a steady diet of junk food, violence programming and synthetic pills. As a result, we are awash with school shootings, suicides and opiate addiction, while the entire country is bordering on PTSD. The media cartel is not helping by force-feeding so much emotionally-charged coverage of tragic events as the unfold. Peace ceremonies are a step in the right direction in seeking an antidote to excessive violence, and cannabis can be an effective tool in breaking opiate addiction and healing PTSD.
After years of study, I've concluded North American peace culture got its start in Congo Square, New Orleans, which is also where cannabis was first instituted as a ceremonial tool on this side of the globe. The key elements of North American peace culture are improvisation and inclusivity.
I recently published a book titled ""Magic, Religion & Cannabis"" that explains my voyage of discovery that led me to attempt to solve the religion problem by inventing a religion with no dogma. We do have one basic rule, however: don't hurt anybody.
  Manifesto of the Pot Illuminati
  Devoted to the Welfare of the World

Cannabis has been a constant provider of human 
welfare throughout humanity’s long journey. The time has come for the 
Pot Illuminati to gather and take our place as stewards of cannabis. We 
seek to help dissolve the oppressive laws against our sacrament. We also
 seek to harness the power and energy of cannabis for the welfare of the
 world.
We have long celebrated the great gifts this unique
 plant offers such as medicine, food, fuel, paper, cordage, paints, 
plastics as well as the sacramental key to higher realms of 
consciousness (if used wisely and in moderation). We have patiently 
waited for humanity to awaken from the ignorance caused by forgetfulness
 and many of our members have suffered great persecution just for their 
acknowledgement and love for the many blessings cannabis has bestowed 
upon us.
But we now stand at the threshold of a great cannabis reawakening, a phoenix rebirth of the mighty healing spirit of cannabis. The Pot Illuminati, as faithful stewards and advocates of cannabis, claim our right to determine, shape and protect the future of cannabis from state and corporate domination and exploitation.
The Pot Illuminati Lodge is a non-political entity 
that embraces all people regardless of race, religion or national 
origin. We seek to blend all the great religions, many of which have 
been perverted to manifest war for profit.  We also seek to disarm the 
dark lords who support Prohibition and we will do this by stealing their
 sigils, their names, their totems, and bending them all to our 
vibrations of peace and respect for Mother Earth.
The Pot Illuminati Grand Lodge: Rules and Dogmas
There is no dogma: Do anything you like, just don’t
 hurt anybody. However that does not mean we do not study and celebrate 
the poetry and myths of past religions. We do. However, we feel free to 
merge concepts from all religions because they are rivers flowing into 
the same sea.
Improvisation is encouraged at all times: always 
allow the inspiration of the moment to manifest and trust your instincts
 because they prove your heart is pure.
The main vibration to manifest is love and when we 
share it, it fills our Temple with a palpable vibration that can be used
 to heal damaged souls and one can feel that energy later in the empty 
Temple long after everyone has left.
The second vibration is fun, as much fun as 
possible, and pranks and jokes are totally fine, provided everyone 
laughs when it’s over, because if anyone cries, you just created a stain
 on your karma.
When the Pot Illuminati gather for an 
improvisational ceremony, no anger or evil telepathic desires should 
manifest in the Temple, and if someone’s energy is not correct, an 
Illuminated Master must rectify the situation quickly, often done by 
inviting the person to share some cannabis.
If someone yells, or starts a violent confrontation
 inside the Temple, it must be cleared immediately, and everyone should 
vacate while an Illuminated Master solves the situation. Members should 
not return until the perpetrator(s) have either left the Temple or been 
excused by the Illuminated Master, and the room should be blessed with 
sage and ceremony and members should pray in silence until the proper 
vibration returns and normal Temple functions can continue.
No member should ever lie, cheat or steal, and if 
caught doing so, they should be expelled. Such matters involve the 
entire membership, or whoever shows up for the trial, and the accused 
can be saved by an Illuminated Master if he believes the facts are in 
doubt.
A small jar of cannabis should be placed on the 
altar in the Temple at all times in case of medical emergencies. Members
 always know they can come to the Temple should they require medicine. 
White powders, hard drugs, and alcohol are not permitted in the Temple. 
Do not bring weapons of violence into the Temple and the penalty for 
this violation is permanent expulsion.
Members should not speak of our society to anyone 
other than a prospective new recruit, nor share our secrets or 
ceremonies with outsiders.
Please never carry more than one ounce of Cannabis 
into the Temple. It is your responsibility to help protect the Temple 
and the members from persecution. We seek to create a refuge from the

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi there everyone! My name is Patricia Jaggernauth here today on behalf of the KNOW YOUR COUNTRY team. I am a Toronto personality and also an entrepreneur passionate about her country: CANADA!!
I'd like to ask you: How well do you KNOW YOUR COUNTRY?
Shockingly, many people know not very much about the country they reside in or were even born in...
That's where this project comes in.
It's called KNOW YOUR COUNTRY and it's Canada's newest most entertaining game show! On this show, we will tour across Canada, coast to coast to coast, quizzing Canadians and those living in Canada on questions they must know the answers to. Now the harder the question, the higher the dollar amount. That's right! Canadians will win cash AND gain knowledge.
This show will test all Canadians and those living in Canada and even those who have a love for Canada, people just like YOU, to find out how well you KNOW YOUR COUNTRY. This show is also the perfect learning tool for all new immigrants preparing for their Canadian citizenship test as it's teaching them about this great country.
For this campaign, we ask you to dip into your pockets and donate to this amazing Canadian initiative! We plan to have KNOW YOUR COUNTRY debut on the web THIS FALL 2015 providing a global reach, following a National TV time slot so all Canadians can tune in, watch and learn!
Only YOUR donations can make this brand, vision and Canadian dream come to life! 
  

What We Need & What You Get KNOW YOUR COUNTRY will need the generous donations by people like YOU to make this dream come alive! Here is a rundown of where the funding is going for Season 1 (12 episodes):
-PRODUCTION:
Editing: $8,000
Host: $6,000
 Camera/Crew/Equipment Rentals (3 people): $22,000
Researcher: $2,000
Web Design: $3,000
Producer/Creator: $3,000
PR/Public Relations/Social Media: $4,000
Cash Giveaway: $10,000 (approximately $800 per episodes x 12 episodes)
Misc: $2,000 (t-shirts, caps, pens, parting gifts for contestants, etc.)


Perks:
Our perks for your generous donations are fun and unique!

-$10 x 100: KNOW YOUR COUNTRY T-Shirt
-$20 x 50: Special thanks in our show credits
-$50 x 10: Meet Patricia Jaggernauth in person and snap a photo with her too!
-$100 x 5: Be on the show, KNOW YOUR COUNTRY, and have a chance to win some cash!
-$500 x 3: 3-minute FaceTime call with Patricia Jaggernauth
-$1,000 x 2: Producer credit on KNOW YOUR COUNTRY
-$5,000 x 2: Be featured on the family edition of KNOW YOUR COUNTRY

The funds will go 100% towards the show. If we do not reach our entire goal of $60,000, less episodes will be filmed.
    Risks & Challenges There can be no reward with no risk and no risk with no reward! Over the past 4 years, we have poured our blood, sweat and tears into this project, KNOW YOUR COUNTRY, to make it what it is. It is the start of a major movement of education, insight and fun!
The risks here are quite low as we already:
1.) Own the brand;
2.) Our brand is Copyright and Trademark protected;
3.) We have the web/website platform to share it on immediately;
4.) Our host is a major, well known, National television and web personality with a large fan base;
5.) Our production team has more than 25+ years of experience;

So, as you can see, the reward of success is truly guaranteed!

</h3><p>I am a mom of amazing twin girls that love to perform and dance. We 
spend many nights at the dance studio getting homework and dinner 
between classes. I am a dance mom and I love it! I am active in the 
community and encourage my children to do the same. This year I was laid
 off from my job of more than 10 years in the tech industry and now have
 the opportunity to pursue my dreams. I want to open a store that can 
give young dancers the tools they need to continue learning and growing 
in an activity that they love doing.

 </p> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $60,000 to open the doors. With this campaign are seeking to 
raise just $10,000 in just 14 days so we can begin working on the store.
 We appreciate anything that you can give - even $1! We're offering some
 
sweet positive reinforcement starting at $100. With a donation of $100 
you will receive a swag bag at our opening night event. If 100 people 
purchased a swag bag, we would be fully funded and ready to get the 
Downtown Dancewear started!
</p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My vision is to create a store that will be an integral part of the 
performer's life and our community. Gilroy &amp; Morgan Hill are 
communities that promote young artists in music, dance, and theater. We 
have multiple dance studios and teams, cheerleader teams, marching bands
 and color guards, and children's musical theaters with no local 
resources for practice wear, shoes, and performance clothing.</p>
<p>
	All these performer's work hard at what they do and want to feel 
special. Personal attention, great customer service and exceptional 
products is what they want and need and that is what I will deliver.</p>
<p>
	Downtown Dancewear will also be an active and vocal member in the 
community by supporting local events and organizations working with 
children in the arts. We will work with local community organizations to
 ensure we are able to make our products accessible to all children in 
our community no matter their economic situation by offering discounted,
 barely used, items so any child in our community that wants to dance 
can.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> The biggest challenges ahead is 
the online market - the hurdle for most new small businesses. We will 
have a brick and mortar store, an online store and a personal shopper 
service to dance studios, trying to open as many sales 
streams as possible. I am very lucky to live in a community that 
supports local business as well as knowing that the personal touch can 
win over the online market.<p>
</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> 
We know that not everyone can or want to make a donation - I totally get that. Every 
little bit helps though, so you can help by telling your friends about the 
store, sharing or liking our posts and photos on Facebook, and 
generally helping us spread the word about the campaign and business!<p></p><br/></div>","Dream of Downtown Dancewear in Gilroy, CA

<p>The lion's share (more than 50%) of all contributions ""Avevitus"" Social Rehabilitation and Development center receives are spent on the <b>RENT of PREMISES</b>!!! </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through this crowdfunding campaign, we aim to raise an initial 390K USD in order to </span>acquire<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> premises we </span>currently<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> rent. In case we are able to exceed the goal </span>substantially<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  we would be able to construct our own center on the </span>privately<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> held land.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It is our wish to use rised funds for </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">hiring best possible specialists in the market to help children</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>rehabilitate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> socially rather than to spend the contributions for the <b>Real Estate Moguls</b>!!!</span></p>
<p>Crowdfunding seems like a great way to do that. We really appreciate your feedback, as well as your support and contributions. Your feedback and support will help us make ""Avevitus"" the best it can be!</p>
<p>This project is running independently for more than 5 years raising funds thgrough subsidies and donations, but to achieve such a big goal we hope for your support which would help us to reach our goal much faster. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Every dollar contributed is directed to improve the quality of ""Avevitus"" center services for children.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are committed to Give children the best available social rehabilitation services and will not settle for anything less. With the years of experience and best experts on the market we have what it takes to deliver the best for the children in need, we just need You to join us in this effort. All of us together can be a part of this small miracle changing a child's life for the better!<br/></span></p>

The lion's share (more than 50%) of all contributions ""Avevitus"" Social Rehabilitation and Development center receives are spent on the RENT of PREMISES!!! 
Through this crowdfunding campaign, we aim to raise an initial 390K USD in order to acquire premises we currently rent. In case we are able to exceed the goal substantially  we would be able to construct our own center on the privately held land.
It is our wish to use rised funds for hiring best possible specialists in the market to help children rehabilitate socially rather than to spend the contributions for the Real Estate Moguls!!!
Crowdfunding seems like a great way to do that. We really appreciate your feedback, as well as your support and contributions. Your feedback and support will help us make ""Avevitus"" the best it can be!
This project is running independently for more than 5 years raising funds thgrough subsidies and donations, but to achieve such a big goal we hope for your support which would help us to reach our goal much faster. Every dollar contributed is directed to improve the quality of ""Avevitus"" center services for children.
We are committed to Give children the best available social rehabilitation services and will not settle for anything less. With the years of experience and best experts on the market we have what it takes to deliver the best for the children in need, we just need You to join us in this effort. All of us together can be a part of this small miracle changing a child's life for the better!
About Us
   Social Development and Rehabilitation Center ""Avevitus"" - is a non-profit multifunction physical development and therapy center. It provides effective additional special education for disabled children, caring for their leisure time, as well as helping to create well-being for their families.At ""Avevitus"", children with special needs are taught to recognize and manage their disability and to look after themselfs. Through exercises and play we help them learn to orientate and move in the environment, improve their fine motoric skills, cognition and physical development. At ""Avevitus"" children gain positive emotions and self-confidence to prepare them for life.Family members of disabled children also get the environment to share information and experiences collectively, they are then better prepared to manage psychological problems resulting from disability, including difficulties in conjugal relations, while trying to overcome the fear of publicity, as well as to better integrate into the society.Our Target Group  Children who are 4-10 years of age with moderate to severe physical disability also with mild to moderate mental retardation, as well as children having disorders related to social and role functioning, sensory, hearing, hypersensitivity, vestibular and body motility.Our mission  Helping disabled children to grow up Healthy, Educated and Motivated!Our vision Social Development and Rehabilitation Centre ""Avevitus""- is the place:
where children with disabilities are treated with individual therapy;
where children are taught self-sufficiency, knowledge of the world as well as how to communicate, share and enjoy life;
where parents and their children are welcome to join mutual assistance groups that enable them to share information, relieve anxiety as well as to celebrate children's achievements.

</div><p><b><i>The <a href=""http://www.mikhuna.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Food Bank MIKHUNA</a> is a non profit organization that aims to improve the nutritional, growth and development conditions of vulnerable families in the province of Azuay, Ecuador, in order to reach food sovereignity in rural and marginal urban areas. The Food Bank MIKHUNA is an unprecedented initiative under the aegis of <a href=""http://www.equidar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EQUIDAR </a>project. </i></b></p>
<p>Since the early beginnings in 2012, EQUIDAR project has been reducing malnutrition
in the province through a comprehensive program that aids nowadays <b>the 9,600 most vulnerable families in the province</b>. Currently, the program further involves 3,200 small scale dairy
farmers, mixed-economy company Lactjubones, and 168
neighborhood stores that support the families with a daily distribution of 9,600 boxes of fresh whole
milk. In order to give integrity to the program, volunteering university students take <b>medical-psychological records</b> to monitor and measure the obtained results in time, offer<b> free comprehensive dental care</b>, <b>train parents </b>on <b>productive entrepreneurship</b> and run workshops on <b>nutrition</b>, <b>social</b> and <b>gender equity</b>. In addition, the program encourages <b>community participation</b> and the <b>eradication of domestic violence</b>.<br/></p>
<p><b>Facts and figures:</b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>40%</b> of households with <b>domestic violence</b></span>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>There have been <b>6,100 medical records</b> created, and 10,000 children and 5,000 mothers examined. <b>3,038 children</b> and <b>161 mothers</b> found in a state of <b>malnutrition</b><br/></b></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">By <b>free</b> <b>distribution</b> of 9,600 liters of milk daily, we have reached <b>34,000 beneficiaries</b> and <b>18,000 participating children</b></span></li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>4,500 comprehensive dental care sessions</b></span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>900 blood counts</b> made</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these high rates of malnutrition, we <b>have been working hard</b> to <b>start</b> another initiative and <b>intensify</b> <b>our fight</b>. In the end, we have
opted for a pilot idea here in Azuay, which has been proved to work elsewhere in the world- a
Food Bank! In November 2015, we launched <b>MIKHUNA, the first Food Bank in the province of Azuay, Ecuador. </b>The<b> main objective </b>of MIKHUNA is to <b>collect</b> enough foodstuffs to <b>provide</b> the 9,600 families with at a <b>symbolic</b> price. </p>
<p><b>What is a Food Bank? </b></p>
<p>A Food Bank is a<b> nonprofit organization</b>, based on <b>volunteerism</b> and
<b>contribution</b> of companies and individuals <b>committed</b> to fighting against hunger
and malnutrition. There are more than 1,000 food banks worldwide helping over 40 million people annually. </p><p>The <b>purpose</b> of the <b>MIKHUNA</b> Food Bank is to collect:<br/></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Food in perfect condition with upcoming expiration dates.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Food with defective packaging or containers suitable for human
consumption</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Surplus food from mass production</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Food that does not meet the highest standards of market (Too small
vegetables and fruits, or with no standard form etc.).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The collected food is distributed in the shortest possible time to the
neediest families; decreasing at the same time the wastage rate in the province
of Azuay. This is how we will facilitate access to healthy and nutritional food and improve health conditions of the vulnerable populations. </p>
<p><b>How does MIKHUNA work?</b></p>
<p>Companies or individuals <b>donate</b> perfectly consumable food to the MIKHUNA Food
Bank where these foodstuffs are <b>selected</b>, <b>classified</b> and <b>stored</b>. After the
<b>verification</b> of the <b>socioeconomic</b> status, the foodstuffs are <b>distributed</b> to the
<b>neediest families </b>at a <b>symbolic price</b>. </p>
<p>In order to contribute to the food security in our province by implementing the first Food Bank, we have
made a <b>strategic alliance</b> with the Foundation Hearts of Gold and the Social
Pastoral Vicariate of Turi.</p><p><br/></p><p><b></b></p><h3><b>Financial matters</b></h3><p></p><p>Despite all our efforts, we have <b>very limited financial resources</b> that <b>prevent</b> us from reaching our goal. The <b>2016 budget</b> for MIKHUNA is <b>60,000 USD</b>. Why is it so <b>little</b>? Because this is what Ecuadorean government allocated to this project and the amount is irrevocable.</p><p>Since the initial costs are always higher, with this amount of money we can only reach out to 200 families. Therefore, <b>we need your help</b> to reach out to 9600 families daily!</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>We need your help</b></h3><p></p><p>With<b> your help</b>, we can achieve our goal to <b>reach out to 9,600 families daily</b>
and <b>improve the quality of life </b>of those in greatest need.
With <b>your support</b>, children will have a healthy and nutritious breakfast, have
energy and <b>better school performance</b>. Only with your <b>back up</b>, we can give a
<b>promising future</b> to the families of the province of Azuay.</p>
<p><b>To reach the goal, we are still missing 300,000 USD.</b></p><p>To run a well performing Food Bank, we need:</p><div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Adaptation of the Food Bank area </b>- 15,000 USD. We have invested around 18,000 USD and are almost done here, but we still need to adjust several rooms to get a fully working facility.</li>
<li>
<b>Cold-storage rooms</b> - 40,000 USD. Up to now, we have been working with non-perishable foodstuffs because we have no place to store the fresh ones. However, fresh products like fruits and vegetables are much healthier! </li>
<li>
<b>Freezers</b>- 15,000 USD. Voluminous freezers guarantee the freshness of the collected food.</li>
<li>
<b>4 refrigerated trucks</b>  - 110,000 USD. They are indispensable to distribute the foods to all the corners of the province while keeping the food fresh. </li>
<li>
<b>Inventory, accounting and beneficiary-monitoring software</b> - 25,000 USD. This tool is vital to ensure the efficiency and operativeness of the Bank. It will keep a record of medical, psychological, dental and nutritional conditions of the beneficiaries. </li>
<li>
<b>Training workshops</b>- 30,000 USD. We intend to train the beneficiaries on how to treat the foodstuffs: storage, cleaning, cooking, and on how to grow agro-economically, for example family orchards. We aim to bring respective experts to Cuenca to teach the workshops. </li>
<li>
<b>Mass fundraising events</b> - 30,000 USD. We plan on organizing 2 massive fundraising events per year in order to gather more money for the bank. </li>
<li>
<b>Awareness-building campaign</b> - 25,000 USD. It is fundamental to let everybody know about our existence and raise awareness about the cause we fight for. Once we are well-known, we will be more successful in raising funds.</li>
<li>
<b>Advertising campaign</b>- 10,000 USD. We would love to reach to as many people as possible. More people conscious about the MIKHUNA Food Bank and willing to help, more improved lives in Azuay.</li>

</div></div>","The Food Bank MIKHUNA is a non profit organization that aims to improve the nutritional, growth and development conditions of vulnerable families in the province of Azuay, Ecuador, in order to reach food sovereignity in rural and marginal urban areas. The Food Bank MIKHUNA is an unprecedented initiative under the aegis of EQUIDAR project. 
Since the early beginnings in 2012, EQUIDAR project has been reducing malnutrition
in the province through a comprehensive program that aids nowadays the 9,600 most vulnerable families in the province. Currently, the program further involves 3,200 small scale dairy
farmers, mixed-economy company Lactjubones, and 168
neighborhood stores that support the families with a daily distribution of 9,600 boxes of fresh whole
milk. In order to give integrity to the program, volunteering university students take medical-psychological records to monitor and measure the obtained results in time, offer free comprehensive dental care, train parents on productive entrepreneurship and run workshops on nutrition, social and gender equity. In addition, the program encourages community participation and the eradication of domestic violence.
Facts and figures:


40% of households with domestic violence

There have been 6,100 medical records created, and 10,000 children and 5,000 mothers examined. 3,038 children and 161 mothers found in a state of malnutrition
By free distribution of 9,600 liters of milk daily, we have reached 34,000 beneficiaries and 18,000 participating children

4,500 comprehensive dental care sessions


900 blood counts made


Given these high rates of malnutrition, we have been working hard to start another initiative and intensify our fight. In the end, we have
opted for a pilot idea here in Azuay, which has been proved to work elsewhere in the world- a
Food Bank! In November 2015, we launched MIKHUNA, the first Food Bank in the province of Azuay, Ecuador. The main objective of MIKHUNA is to collect enough foodstuffs to provide the 9,600 families with at a symbolic price. 
What is a Food Bank? 
A Food Bank is a nonprofit organization, based on volunteerism and
contribution of companies and individuals committed to fighting against hunger
and malnutrition. There are more than 1,000 food banks worldwide helping over 40 million people annually. The purpose of the MIKHUNA Food Bank is to collect:

Food in perfect condition with upcoming expiration dates.
Food with defective packaging or containers suitable for human
consumption
Surplus food from mass production
Food that does not meet the highest standards of market (Too small
vegetables and fruits, or with no standard form etc.).

The collected food is distributed in the shortest possible time to the
neediest families; decreasing at the same time the wastage rate in the province
of Azuay. This is how we will facilitate access to healthy and nutritional food and improve health conditions of the vulnerable populations. 
How does MIKHUNA work?
Companies or individuals donate perfectly consumable food to the MIKHUNA Food
Bank where these foodstuffs are selected, classified and stored. After the
verification of the socioeconomic status, the foodstuffs are distributed to the
neediest families at a symbolic price. 
In order to contribute to the food security in our province by implementing the first Food Bank, we have
made a strategic alliance with the Foundation Hearts of Gold and the Social
Pastoral Vicariate of Turi.Financial mattersDespite all our efforts, we have very limited financial resources that prevent us from reaching our goal. The 2016 budget for MIKHUNA is 60,000 USD. Why is it so little? Because this is what Ecuadorean government allocated to this project and the amount is irrevocable.Since the initial costs are always higher, with this amount of money we can only reach out to 200 families. Therefore, we need your help to reach out to 9600 families daily!
We need your helpWith your help, we can achieve our goal to reach out to 9,600 families daily
and improve the quality of life of those in greatest need.
With your support, children will have a healthy and nutritious breakfast, have
energy and better school performance. Only with your back up, we can give a
promising future to the families of the province of Azuay.
To reach the goal, we are still missing 300,000 USD.To run a well performing Food Bank, we need:


Adaptation of the Food Bank area - 15,000 USD. We have invested around 18,000 USD and are almost done here, but we still need to adjust several rooms to get a fully working facility.

Cold-storage rooms - 40,000 USD. Up to now, we have been working with non-perishable foodstuffs because we have no place to store the fresh ones. However, fresh products like fruits and vegetables are much healthier! 

Freezers- 15,000 USD. Voluminous freezers guarantee the freshness of the collected food.

4 refrigerated trucks  - 110,000 USD. They are indispensable to distribute the foods to all the corners of the province while keeping the food fresh. 

Inventory, accounting and beneficiary-monitoring software - 25,000 USD. This tool is vital to ensure the efficiency and operativeness of the Bank. It will keep a record of medical, psychological, dental and nutritional conditions of the beneficiaries. 

Training workshops- 30,000 USD. We intend to train the beneficiaries on how to treat the foodstuffs: storage, cleaning, cooking, and on how to grow agro-economically, for example family orchards. We aim to bring respective experts to Cuenca to teach the workshops. 

Mass fundraising events - 30,000 USD. We plan on organizing 2 massive fundraising events per year in order to gather more money for the bank. 

Awareness-building campaign - 25,000 USD. It is fundamental to let everybody know about our existence and raise awareness about the cause we fight for. Once we are well-known, we will be more successful in raising funds.

Advertising campaign- 10,000 USD. We would love to reach to as many people as possible. More people conscious about the MIKHUNA Food Bank and willing to help, more improved lives in Azuay.

 learned that many women were the sole providers for their families, and
 had been affected by atrocities such as illness, spousal abuse, war, 
unemployment, and death. Realizing, but for an accident of birth, it

</h2></div>","Shopping for a Change (SFAC)
 is a 501 (3)(c) that helps artisans, artisan co-ops, and companies that employs these artisans from
 impoverished areas, sell fair-trade goods via our digital marketplace. We pay the artisans up front for their goods, sell their products, then donate our net proceeds to:
 fund international community improvement projects focused on 
clean water, healthcare, and education in the artisans' communities, 

U.S.-based nonprofits (nonprofits that YOU get to choose at checkout)!

We need your help to further progress the amazing work being done, and the improvement we are seeing in the lives of people both here and abroad. We need the ability to: purchase beautiful new inventory, create marketing materials, maintain our website, and grow our team. 
Added funds for SFAC will allow us to provide work for additional 
artisans, enabling even more impoverished women (men too!) to continue improving 
their lives through their own efforts. SFAC operates as an all-volunteer organization with no salaries and no rent.Our story began in 2009 when our founder, Stacey Horowitz, visited Peru with her family.She
 witnessed the ugly face of hunger and poverty in sharp contrast with 
the innate beauty of these regions first hand. Noticing the wealth of 
artistic talent passed down through generations, she knew that given the
 right circumstances, this could be their means to a better life. She
 learned that many women were the sole providers for their families, and
 had been affected by atrocities such as illness, spousal abuse, war, 
unemployment, and death. Realizing, but for an accident of birth, it 
could have been her living under similar conditions, Stacey arrived home
 a different person. She felt compelled to do something to help better 
the lives of these women and their children. The following year she 
founded Shopping for a Change®  to combat some of these problems in a 
way familiar to most of us —online shopping.Step 1: We pay our artisans up front for their creations according to the terms
 they set, so they immediately benefit from their work. When you buy 
their products from us through our website and live events, you provide 
them the means to lift themselves from poverty and enable them to feed, 
shelter, and educate their children, thereby opening doors to 
socioeconomic change.Step 2: The net proceeds from your purchases 
are then split two ways. Fifty percent is used to fund Community 
Improvement Projects and grants abroad. The other fifty percent is 
directed to a U.S. based charitable organization chosen by the consumer 
at checkout. Below are just some of the nonprofits that we work 
with. The impact of your purchase not only affects the artisans, but 
their families, their communities, their countries—and ours.         It thrills us to say that in the five years since our launch, we 
have grown from partnering with 11 artisan groups in Africa and South 
America to over 50 artisan groups spanning 4 continents and 28 
countries. And through our network of artisan partnerships we are touching the lives of over 43,000 artisans. Our business 
has more than tripled, indicating that people are excited by the way our 
organization enables them to help both at home and abroad. We have completed 4 community improvement projects with our next project to be funded in January 2016.The Future Looks Bright Project: Half of the net proceeds from our 2015 product sales will be used to provide eyewear for 2500 artisans across three (3) continents, who need glasses for their detailed work.

<h2>About Jervoise </h2>
<div>Jervoise is an organic cattle station in North Queensland. We have 70,000 acres of land and currently run about 5,000 head of certified organic cattle.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447040196/bglt5d7uhnrub8zlwesk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>The station has been owned and run by the Jonsson family since 1965, and we've always done things a little differently from the norm. Greg Jonsson ('Pa') decided to stop dipping and spraying the cattle back in 1979, a move which had our farmer neighbours questioning whether he'd spent too much time in the sun! </div><div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">These days, eliminating the use of chemicals from food production hardly seems radical, b</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ut back then there wasn't such a thing as 'organic farming' or a certified organic body, let alone accreditation standards like we have now.</span>
</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div>
<div>We gained our official organic certification in 1996 and up until we lost our abattoir in 2014, our business was thriving. In fact, we were experiencing a surge in demand for organic meat as consumers became more aware of animal welfare, a concern for the environment and food free from chemicals and hormones. </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447208704/cvolbv83h0x4dwggm7ca.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div></div>=============================<div>
<br/><h2><b>So how did we lose our abattoir?</b></h2>
<div>We knew that in order to be able to control the quality of our meat and ensure that it didn't come into contact with any chemicals or poisons, we needed to have our own processing facility. So in 2005 we embarked on an ambitious project to buy our own abattoir. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We took a loan out from an Australian banking institution and purchased a property on the coast, at nearby Tully, and opened Far North Queensland's first and only certified organic abattoir. Business was booming and our market was growing steadily.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>But in 2014 disaster hit for us. We were contacted by Powerlink and told that the land on which the abattoir sat was to be acquired to expand an existing substation. It was to be a mandatory land acquisition and there was nothing we could do to fight it. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We had no choice but to accept a payout amount from the Queensland Government which was insufficient to allow us to build a new abattoir, and we had to walk away. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In yet another blow, our banking institution took the entire payout to reduce our debt to equity ratio due to non organic values being used by the bank, leaving us with no way to rebuild.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">It was absolutely devastating, to lose everything that we'd worked so hard for ten years to build.</span><br/></p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Since then we've been forced to hire the facilities of other abattoirs around North Queensland in order to keep our loyal customers satisfied and to provide the quality product they have come to know and expect. However, we can only hire the facilities for three days at a time during weekends, when we need it for at least a week. We're at the mercy of the facility owners with regards to availability. We also need to thoroughly clean any hired facilities to ensure they are free from harmful chemicals prior to use and it's an extremely costly exercise for us. It's simply not sustainable for us to continue like this.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div></div>=============================</div><div>
<br/><h2><b>Where to from here?</b></h2>
<div>Since losing our abattoir we have been transporting our animals approximately 320kms on a stressful journey. We then process the meat and store it in Cairns 400kms away. We then drive 250kms home, meaning we are practically living on the roads. Transporting our animals in this way is detrimental to them and to the quality of the final meat product. Our family is suffering, we are always on the road and never home, and it is dangerous and exhausting, both physically and mentally.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We need to build an abattoir right here at Jervoise Station.

</div></div>","AN UPDATE (February 2016):It has been a very busy start to the new year for us here at Jervoise, but we have GOOD NEWS to share with you all...Thanks to the efforts of the crowdfunding and awareness that the campaign created, we have secured ALL of the funds required to build a new abattoir here at Jervoise Station - from plans to construction and full operation!This has been made possible through the kindness and generosity of a fellow North Queenslander who has offered to help us in a financial capacity. This is not a hand OUT, it is a hand UP, and once we are up and operating again, we will be able to repay this great kindness.The money we raised from the crowdfunding is being used to cover the cost of the abattoir plans and Government fees that we need to pay to get the build approved. Plans are being finalised as we write this, our builder is on standby and boxes are being ticked with the appropriate Councils.Within the first year of the new abattoir being open, we plan to be producing our own goat, lamb, pigs and chickens as well as our beef. All of these will be grown on Jervoise and fully certified organic.To those of you that donated to our campaign, those that shared and helped us get the word out - we cannot THANK YOU enough. The future of our farm and our family has been secured and we are excited to be moving towards again being able to provide North Queensland families with quality organic product.Please follow us on our Facebook page for updates on the build and supply of Jervoise products during this time. In gratitude ...Kerry, Kristine and the Jonsson family xx""We're a hard working bunch, and proud too. So it's mighty hard for us to ask for help. But we know that if we don't raise enough money, Jervoise will close and our family will be left with nothing. North Queensland will also loose it's largest certified organic beef producer."" ~ Kerry Jonsson=============================
About Jervoise 
Jervoise is an organic cattle station in North Queensland. We have 70,000 acres of land and currently run about 5,000 head of certified organic cattle.



The station has been owned and run by the Jonsson family since 1965, and we've always done things a little differently from the norm. Greg Jonsson ('Pa') decided to stop dipping and spraying the cattle back in 1979, a move which had our farmer neighbours questioning whether he'd spent too much time in the sun! 

These days, eliminating the use of chemicals from food production hardly seems radical, but back then there wasn't such a thing as 'organic farming' or a certified organic body, let alone accreditation standards like we have now.

We gained our official organic certification in 1996 and up until we lost our abattoir in 2014, our business was thriving. In fact, we were experiencing a surge in demand for organic meat as consumers became more aware of animal welfare, a concern for the environment and food free from chemicals and hormones. 


=============================
So how did we lose our abattoir?
We knew that in order to be able to control the quality of our meat and ensure that it didn't come into contact with any chemicals or poisons, we needed to have our own processing facility. So in 2005 we embarked on an ambitious project to buy our own abattoir. 

We took a loan out from an Australian banking institution and purchased a property on the coast, at nearby Tully, and opened Far North Queensland's first and only certified organic abattoir. Business was booming and our market was growing steadily.  

But in 2014 disaster hit for us. We were contacted by Powerlink and told that the land on which the abattoir sat was to be acquired to expand an existing substation. It was to be a mandatory land acquisition and there was nothing we could do to fight it. We had no choice but to accept a payout amount from the Queensland Government which was insufficient to allow us to build a new abattoir, and we had to walk away. 

In yet another blow, our banking institution took the entire payout to reduce our debt to equity ratio due to non organic values being used by the bank, leaving us with no way to rebuild.

It was absolutely devastating, to lose everything that we'd worked so hard for ten years to build.

Since then we've been forced to hire the facilities of other abattoirs around North Queensland in order to keep our loyal customers satisfied and to provide the quality product they have come to know and expect. However, we can only hire the facilities for three days at a time during weekends, when we need it for at least a week. We're at the mercy of the facility owners with regards to availability. We also need to thoroughly clean any hired facilities to ensure they are free from harmful chemicals prior to use and it's an extremely costly exercise for us. It's simply not sustainable for us to continue like this.

=============================
Where to from here?
Since losing our abattoir we have been transporting our animals approximately 320kms on a stressful journey. We then process the meat and store it in Cairns 400kms away. We then drive 250kms home, meaning we are practically living on the roads. Transporting our animals in this way is detrimental to them and to the quality of the final meat product. Our family is suffering, we are always on the road and never home, and it is dangerous and exhausting, both physically and mentally.

We need to build an abattoir right here at Jervoise Station. By doing this we will again have complete control of the processing of our own certified organic beef, with animal welfare and the welfare of our family greatly improved. This will mean we can continue doing what we love and what we are passionate about - farming healthy, organic cattle, peacefully.





=============================
Where's the Indegogo money going?
We need to raise $250k so that we can, in combination with a loan from the Government's Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority (QRAA) program, build and equip the first stage of a fully integrated multi-species organic abattoir at Jervoise Station, our home of 50 years.


We’ll use the IndieGoGo funds raised here to fund the first stage of the building process - paying the architect for the building plans, paying the SARA fees to be able to operate the abattoir, and to engage contractors to lay the building foundations and initial shed construction. The QRAA loans are limited to only $200,000 for equipment so we will also need to use some of the funds we are raising here to purchase essential equipment.



Once we've covered the cost of those initial building stages, the final steps will be funded through a special loan from the QRAA.


The new abattoir will be certified organic which means we'll be able to put into action our plans to expand into other areas of production - organic chicken, lamb and pork - which is in huge demand in Queensland.How you can help

<p>We noticed that many of the farmers’ hacks are focused on efficiently utilising space and finding efficient ways to grow in small areas.

<p>In honour of their origins we have called them SmallFolders. Farmers are the experts who know best how to grow plants using simple techniques developed over years of experimentation and innovation. Therefore, with SmallFolders we have adapted farmers’ gardening designs, showcasing the in-depth knowledge of smallholders and the relevance of their expertise to western audiences.</p>

SmallFolders will help you grow herbs and plants, keep bees, and bring the magic of nature straight from the fields to your balcony or windowsill.





We know that many people living in urban settings struggle to keep plants in small spaces. So, with this campaign, we want to bring you products straight from the experts themselves - the Farmers! 




Who? Cafédirect Producers’ Foundation

We are Cafédirect Producers’ Foundation (CPF) and we work with a network of 280,000 smallholder farmers and 37 farmer cooperatives across Africa and Latin America.   


Our work helps to create forums in which farmers can get together to share their experiences, knowledge and innovations with one another. 

Farmer Hacks - big ideas for tiny spaces

We noticed that many of the farmers’ hacks are focused on efficiently utilising space and finding efficient ways to grow in small areas. These are very similar challenges to the ones we face in London. Here we saw the opportunity to take these designs direct from the fields of smallholder farmers and turn them into products ready for urban environments. 
In honour of their origins we have called them SmallFolders. Farmers are the experts who know best how to grow plants using simple techniques developed over years of experimentation and innovation. Therefore, with SmallFolders we have adapted farmers’ gardening designs, showcasing the in-depth knowledge of smallholders and the relevance of their expertise to western audiences.


How? The Products 

We have been assisted by product designers from Those to take the farmers' ideas and create the initial product designs!

We now have a great working model of a vertical garden to accompany designs for two further SmallFolder products: the Bee Hive, and the Bug Trap. 


Your support will make these a reality - as well as feed money back in to help develop even more products with our farming network!


What? The Perks 




SmallFolders - a fun series of packs 

Our SmallFolder packs will include:

information about the origin of the idea.
some Farmer Tips - to help you get the most out of your SmallFolders.
copies of the original sketch or smallholder idea.
instructions on how to easily assemble and use your SmallFolder.
the SmallFolders themselves! 








Vertical Garden - a simple way of keeping a kitchen garden in a small space

From farmers of: Michimikuru Tea Factory, Kenya

The Farmers Challenge: Lack of free land can make growing food for consumption very difficult. Vertical gardens are a good solution as they help keep in moisture when it’s hot, and let water drain out when it’s wet.
Why you’ll love it: Owning a garden in cities is rare but with the vertical garden you can grow plants even in a small flat. The vertical garden is flat-packed, easy to set up, and comes in a variety of colours suitable to grow your favourite foods in your own home.







Bug Trap - a simple way of controlling unwanted bugs from destroying a harvest


From farmers of: FEDECARES, Dominican Republic
The Farmers Challenge: Coffee farmers in Latin America lose a lot of their crop to pests and diseases. Solutions to this can be expensive and damaging to the environment. Therefore, farmers in the Dominican Republic designed these homemade traps using everyday materials, such as recycled bottles, as a more environmentally friendly alternative.
Why you’ll love it: We’ve developed this bug trap to replicate the original’s effectiveness but with a smaller body and modern design, perfect for your home!




Bee Hive - a simple way to keep bees and produce honey 


From farmers at: Chirinos, Perú
The Farmers Challenge: Smallholder farmers often seek ways to diversify their incomes and bring in some extra cash to the household. Farmers in Perú have found a solution by harvesting honey and beeswax which can be consumed at home or sold at the market. 
Why you’ll love it: Bees are in serious trouble. Their populations are declining rapidly and causing huge problems within complex ecosystems. However, people in both urban and rural environments can help. Our Bee Hive enables you to keep bees on your balcony and give them a home in the city.

<h3><b>Why a Campaign for CANTY?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>‘Canty’ is an old British word, an adjective meaning 'passionate,
spirited, full of life.' And it’s now a new brand: a line of cause-crafted cases for women’s necessaries, and
to accessorize their world.  Against objectification, and beyond
empowerment, <span style=""color: rgb(61, 61, 61); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">there’s CANTY®. </span></p>

<p><span>Our brand has been met with raving reviews and brisk sales in our limited release to date. W</span><span>ith your help, our goal in this campaign is to bring to market the CANTY<i>clutch</i>. This talking piece designer tin clutch will organize your phone, credit cards, chapstick and other essentials with style. This signature CANTY design will be produced as a limited edition. </span>In our opening months of sales, no product has generated more requests than this one! Here's a v1.0 prototype sketch: </p>

<h3><b>Our Mission: Spreading 'Passion for Good'</b></h3>CANTY is a women-owned business that is a celebration of the
epic ‘Passion for Good’ that women bring to the world every day, in many moments and places. Our medium
of expression is cause art, which we apply to cases that women need and enjoy -- for their purse or tote or backpack, or for their desk, dresser or kitchen counter. We’ve met with famous and ‘everyday-ordinary’
designers to shape our vision and bring it to life. And we partnered with <b><a href=""http://www.sevenly.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sevenly</a></b> to draw from the world’s
most celebrated library of cause art.</div><div>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We listened to women like you from near and far about the needs that our cases might satisfy, and about your places and spaces we could accessorize with CANTY cases.  Along the way, we also found women whose stories
inspired us, and whose ideas inspired our initial product collection. </span>
<p></p>
<p>The group of us CANTY co-founders constantly remind ourselves of why we started.  We all have our own stories. <b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmocXJ5Fn3A"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> This one we shared</a></b>, and millions watched. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our own stories compelled us to action; the stories of other women inspired us to risk....</span></p>

We can make a donation to charities in the fight for what's right. We can inspire ourselves and others to take action. But what would happen if there was a brand that combines all these into a line of products for our everyday lives?</span><br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Why a Campaign for CANTY?


‘Canty’ is an old British word, an adjective meaning 'passionate,
spirited, full of life.' And it’s now a new brand: a line of cause-crafted cases for women’s necessaries, and
to accessorize their world.  Against objectification, and beyond
empowerment, there’s CANTY®. 


Our brand has been met with raving reviews and brisk sales in our limited release to date. With your help, our goal in this campaign is to bring to market the CANTYclutch. This talking piece designer tin clutch will organize your phone, credit cards, chapstick and other essentials with style. This signature CANTY design will be produced as a limited edition. In our opening months of sales, no product has generated more requests than this one! Here's a v1.0 prototype sketch: 





Our Mission: Spreading 'Passion for Good'CANTY is a women-owned business that is a celebration of the
epic ‘Passion for Good’ that women bring to the world every day, in many moments and places. Our medium
of expression is cause art, which we apply to cases that women need and enjoy -- for their purse or tote or backpack, or for their desk, dresser or kitchen counter. We’ve met with famous and ‘everyday-ordinary’
designers to shape our vision and bring it to life. And we partnered with Sevenly to draw from the world’s
most celebrated library of cause art.
We listened to women like you from near and far about the needs that our cases might satisfy, and about your places and spaces we could accessorize with CANTY cases.  Along the way, we also found women whose stories
inspired us, and whose ideas inspired our initial product collection. 

The group of us CANTY co-founders constantly remind ourselves of why we started.  We all have our own stories.  This one we shared, and millions watched. Our own stories compelled us to action; the stories of other women inspired us to risk....





Our Product Collection: Now, and Not Yet : )
Every great journey starts with small steps. You can learn about our first steps and inspirational stories through our brand launch video here. We wanted to find a new product category that would be functional and inspirational.  A line of women's cases was the answer.  
The first products in the CANTY line demonstrate both functional and lifestyle inspiration: CANTYkinis, CANTYhose, and two CANTYcase designs with award-winning Sevenly® art.  You can read all about each in the list of perks or in our version 1.0 website at www.canty.us. They're all connected to a CANTY woman whose charitable work is noted by an iconic mark, emblematic of their cause. Each product in this opening collection is innovative and carries the brand's essence.





The Brand ObjectiveBut more than that, we wanted to create cases that make a statement -- EVERY CASE A CONVERSATION® -- and that inspire the one who holds or sees it. We know we can verbally express our disgust with the objectification of women and girls -- from porn to trafficking to gendercide. We can make a donation to charities in the fight for what's right. We can inspire ourselves and others to take action. But what would happen if there was a brand that combines all these into a line of products for our everyday lives?
Passion for Good would multiply. The group of us began to call it ""The CANTY Effect."" We white-boarded it like this:  




It all starts with a spark of CANTY in one woman who applies her Passion for Good to a great cause. She inspires a CANTY-branded product. Each of those products sold benefit her work. The women who enjoy the product carry the CANTY spirit to more women.  We join together to support great causes, share new stories, and empower each other to apply our Passion for Good to the great challenges of our time. The CANTY Effect happens: making the world better in ways big and small. These stories are already unfolding on the CANTY Women blog.

We're committed to making CANTY a participatory brand. To us, that means we'll invite our customers to help create product design ideas, select art, and connect those products to the charitable work of CANTY women.  We're also committed to making CANTY a sustainable brand. That means we'll be very selective about our supply chain sourcing, even when it costs us. Our first cases, for example, were all sourced by the same partners used by Trader Joe's, so that certificates we could obtain were further validated by due diligence from another brand we trusted.
Product line expansion will include the CANTYclutch, pill/vitamin cases, and the CANTYlongcase (for glasses, pens and hygiene products), as well as convenience cases for business cards, cosmetics and other necessaries. CANTY cases will be crafted to accessorize a woman’s desk, kitchen, and dresser, too. We'll also promote the CANTY spirit through a small line of wall art, shirts, stickers and other wearables and shareables to create conversation about Passion for Good.





Why This Campaign Matters


Our brand has been met with raving reviews and brisk sales in our limited release to date. We've felt deeply grateful and affirmed in our mission. You've cheered us to move forward! So this campaign marks the next step in the adventure: bringing to market what we believe will be our signature release, to help project the brand. 







We launched the business with our own capital, and lots of sweat equity. We're all in. To bring the CANTYclutch to market, we'll need some help. If we can raise $21,000, we can bring this product to market by March. If we can raise more, we'll be able to enhance certain design and personalization options, which we'll share with you, and we'll be able to amplify the brand to market.  

Another way of looking at it is this way: the more we raise, the more we promise we'll be showing and seeing more CANTY in the world. :)


Risks & Challenges




We all value transparency. So we'll be clear in saying that we're young. We're inclined to risk because we're passionate.  We sometimes get impatient when things don't get done, or when we sense the time was yesterday for us to have a brand like this that creates stories like these. 
We've surrounded ourselves with good counsel and seasoned entrepreneurs and managers and partners.  But, we'll make mistakes - maybe nylon stockings are coming back, but maybe not....
We also recognize that we may not be able to scale with production agility and pricing advantage while maintaining our core principles of social impact and sustainable, ethical production. We may need to activate new product in creative ways, and with limited supply.  
We've measured these risks. We believe that the need for more CANTY in the places where we live, along with early proof of concept and early fan support, make these risks and the challenges of this campaign well worthwhile. So...

<p>
</p>
<p>When
owner/operator Dan Gorder opened State of Bean Coffeehouse over a decade ago, he had no
idea where it would lead him.  Though it started as a simple
coffee shop, it quickly grew to include ice cream, in-house roasted coffee, and a simple café menu.  To accommodate the growing demand, Dan packed up shop and moved two blocks south to become The Bean Coffee &amp; Wine
Cafe.  He added a drive-thru window and offered an expanded menu with artisan sandwiches, salads, and
soups.  He also traded the ice cream for a wide variety of imported wine and craft beers (awesome decision!).  State of Bean/The Bean has now been a staple in the Andover community for eleven years, striving to provide the northern suburbs with Uptown atmosphere but
without all the hassle of the city.  However,
to better achieve that goal, it is once again time for a change!</p>
<p>Kortni Ringwall has been a part of The Bean for nearly four years, developing and perfecting her culinary techniques while providing Dan an ear to spew his aspirations.  After Kortni spent a year stint in the ""real world,"" Dan convinced her to become his Executive Chef with instructions to rebuild the kitchen and completely revamp the menu.  The ultimate goal?  To turn The Bean into more... much more...</p>
<p>BRIO
will be the perfect blend of Owner Dan’s past and Chef Kortni’s future.  During
the day, BRIO will be a breakfast and lunch café, offering the best
in local coffee, homemade baked goods, and a new full-breakfast menu.  As homage to The Bean, the lunch menu will continue to feature our favorite artisan sandwiches like the Red Feathered Pig and the classic
Caprese.  However, come the evening, BRIO will transform into a modern fine-casual
restaurant with full table service.  The highly trained wait-staff will serve great espresso, craft
brews, and hand-picked wines that pair perfectly with the ever rotating dinner
menu.</p>
<p>With
the elevated serving standards, fresh take on classic dishes, and strong
passion to bring the best we can to our customers, BRIO will not only be an
Andover staple, but a Twin Cities destination restaurant.</p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<div>Though BRIO's kitchen remodel is fully funded, we are asking for help with our advertising plan and interior refresh.  We plan on primarily using a word-of-mouth advertising plan; however we need $7000 to purchase new signage for the building.  This sign will show people that we have officially become BRIO!  The rest of our fundraising goal is all for YOU!  We are so excited to have all of you be a part of becoming BRIO!  We are a community-driven restaurant that loves our regular customers, which is why we want to become BRIO!  Many people have asked how they can get involved and this is your answer.  All of our rewards are built to be the most comfortable and practical to suit you guys! </div><div>If we are fortunate enough to exceed our goal, all of that funding will go towards our new dinnerware: plates, silverware, and wine glasses; and continued interior improvements, such as new flooring, booths, and lighting.</div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>BRIO is exciting, new, classic, modern, young, experienced, and zealous all wrapped into one restaurant.  Though we are technically a single establishment, we will be a combination of TWO concepts: a morning coffee café paired with an evening fine-casual restaurant.  BRIO will provide the Northern Suburbs a much needed culinary haven; offering everything from breakfast classics like pancakes &amp; French toast, to modernized dinner plates such as seared scallops and chicken roulade. </div><div>This combination of dinning experiences is hard to find anywhere in this area. Outside of the stereotypical food chains, most establishments cater to the sports bar theme.  Though that certainly has its place in the culinary world, people deserve to have another option!  BRIO is that option!</div><div><br/></div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div> </div><p> </p><div>
</div><p>We
are all very confident in BRIO!  We have been around for 11 years, and all during that time we have been diligent in listening to what our customers are looking for in their restaurant offerings.  However, there are three main concerns we have with
the big change: upsetting our current clientele, bringing in new faces, and risking the business we've already built. </p><div>
</div><p>To
handle our current customers, we plan on being very open and honest about all
the changes.  We have been very talkative about all our changes: the menu, the
name, the kitchen remodel, the booths &amp; flooring, etc…  By keeping an open
line of communication with our regulars, we have been able to answer their
questions and settle their anxiety about BRIO.</p><div>
</div><p>When
it comes to bringing in new customers, most restaurants take a strong
advertising stance and just want to get their logo out and seen.  At BRIO, we strongly
believe in the power of word of mouth advertising.  Though we will have our logo
out there, we plan on bringing new people through the door by sending people
out the door who have had the best BRIO experience we can give them!  If we
truly do what we do best, then the word will spread.</p><div>
</div><p>Owner
Dan Gorder, Chef Kortni Ringwall, and Manager Amber Bullock have all been
working very hard to get BRIO going!  All three are professionals of their
industry; Business, Culinary Arts, and Front of House Management.  Simply put, this means
all three are risking their hard earned titles by becoming BRIO.  They have
worked very hard to get to this point and they don’t plan on stopping.  With the
unique combination of youth, experience, and passion, becoming BRIO means
becoming better versions of themselves!  Only when you’re the best version of
yourself can you be the best, and that is truly our goal as we become BRIO.</p><div>
</div><ul>
</ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><div>We have had to be very careful and diligent in our spending as we make the necessary changes to become BRIO... trust us when we say, we understand the tight budget mindset!  Don't feel left out if you can't donate financially!  We understand and would love your donation in other ways.  For example, sharing Brio and this campaign through your social media sites, liking our Facebook page, or by simply coming in and trying all of our offerings for yourself!  We appreciate your support in any form!</div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary

As an adult this passion came back by baking treats for my daughter and later for my pets. About four years ago, our oldest dog ""Girl"", 13 years old at the time, had her health starting to decline.  Being a single mom, we have had to live paycheck to paycheck for as long as I can remember, so purchasing fancy food and medication for our pet was not that feasible.  After researching on alternative food with natural ingredients doggies need in their daily diet, I decided to make healthy homemade food for them. Girl's health improved within weeks - so I asked myself, why not make doggie treats as well. So I did! This is how Barkery Delights was born.

Around July 2015, I was able to start the sale of these products.  Unfortunately, due to lack of funds, I have not even scratched the surface of achieving my dream of using my passion to make others happy.  </p>

The goals of RHR are to enable First Responders to restore and resume his/her work in a highly productive manner -- and to avoid negative outcomes such as family dissolution, chemical dependence, or suicide.The retreat is staffed by clinical professionals, specially-trained peer counselors, and ordained chaplains.  At the end of the week, RHR participants will have learned and practiced new life skills and gained friends and confidants who understand their issues (personal and professional) as trusted lifelines for the rest of their career and beyond.Because of the stigma of PTSD, many First Responders fear loss of their careers.   Rotary helps calm this fear by providing a program designed to help First Responders retain and restore their careers by creating and funding retreat operations.   Yet when insurance benefits are not available, additional help is needed from those of us -- ALL of us -- who are served by First Responders as individuals, as families, and as organizations.   The partial ""scholarship"" funded by all of us fills this need.Please contribute what you can to help our heroes continue their careers and enjoy a healthy, productive life.Thank you.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>So here we have a classic case of a strong spirited person from an underserved community having the desire and will to change. He has also demonstrated his role as a “change agent” for his community by enlisting the help. But what does he need to break out of the shackles? Shouldn’t we as the community play a role in making his dream “love bananas” bear fruit?  The impact to his Village and others in the Orang Asli community will be far reaching.  For example, we noticed that the Orang Asli here do not place a great deal of emphasis on education as children are encouraged to help their parents look for money at an early age.  There have been many cases of young teens (girls especially) fleeing to the towns in search of more money - the outcome is catastrophic for this community and we will not even touch this subject.  A sustainable income for the families will allow them to put education in its proper place, as a tool for future social mobility.  The Orang Asli children are significantly behind with negative future ramifications for this society.  This project allows us to break this cycle and give the Parents and their children a chance.</p>

<p><b>About:</b></p> <p></p>
<p>My name is Queen and I am a single mother of a 5 year old.  Being a single mom has not been
easy in terms of accomplishing one's goals. I had not planned on being a single
mom, but I accepted the situation, buckled myself with prayer, resilience, and determination.  I continue to strive to fulfill
my passion. I am currently in a cosmetology school that is accommodating to all
types of hair styling and its focus being healthy hair. In addition, I am also
pursuing a doctoral degree at a Michigan University. Trying to attain all of this has not been an easy
journey.  However, the focus of being well
balanced and financially free to take care of life's basics needs and being the
best mom I can be continues to be a struggle.  </p>
<p>Single mothers have the stigma
of  relying on state aid to alleviate the
financial stress of taking care of a child.  However, if the choices were given, state aid would not be an option due to the bureaucracy involved, but rather on a
fulfilling and prosperous career.  </p>
<p>Often people ask me, ""<i>How do you do it</i>?"" and I often say,
""<i>I do not know. I just pray and by
God's grace, I just do it</i>."" Based on this frequently asked question, I
have decided to host an event in 2016  along with a friend, who is also a single
mother and has a story of her own to tell. 
Her story and her determination inspires me.  She is a survivor and a mother of three. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>Description of Event:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the US census, more
than 80% of single mothers were head of household  in 2014. Single mothers continue to carry the weight of what two
parents should be responsible and accountable for in raising a child. Taking on
such a task can be overwhelming and therefore, can sometimes give a single mother a sense of inadequacy and isolation.  </p>
<p>Single
mothers need a community behind them. 
The challenges of raising a child alone day-to-day can be daunting and leave
mothers feeling under supported. <i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Single Mothers with A Determined

</div></div>","About: 
My name is Queen and I am a single mother of a 5 year old.  Being a single mom has not been
easy in terms of accomplishing one's goals. I had not planned on being a single
mom, but I accepted the situation, buckled myself with prayer, resilience, and determination.  I continue to strive to fulfill
my passion. I am currently in a cosmetology school that is accommodating to all
types of hair styling and its focus being healthy hair. In addition, I am also
pursuing a doctoral degree at a Michigan University. Trying to attain all of this has not been an easy
journey.  However, the focus of being well
balanced and financially free to take care of life's basics needs and being the
best mom I can be continues to be a struggle.  
Single mothers have the stigma
of  relying on state aid to alleviate the
financial stress of taking care of a child.  However, if the choices were given, state aid would not be an option due to the bureaucracy involved, but rather on a
fulfilling and prosperous career.  
Often people ask me, ""How do you do it?"" and I often say,
""I do not know. I just pray and by
God's grace, I just do it."" Based on this frequently asked question, I
have decided to host an event in 2016  along with a friend, who is also a single
mother and has a story of her own to tell. 
Her story and her determination inspires me.  She is a survivor and a mother of three. 

Description of Event:

According to the US census, more
than 80% of single mothers were head of household  in 2014. Single mothers continue to carry the weight of what two
parents should be responsible and accountable for in raising a child. Taking on
such a task can be overwhelming and therefore, can sometimes give a single mother a sense of inadequacy and isolation.  
Single
mothers need a community behind them. 
The challenges of raising a child alone day-to-day can be daunting and leave
mothers feeling under supported. Single Mothers with A Determined
Spirit is an
event scheduled for the summer of 2016. The event will revitalize single
mothers' career plan of action to reach an attainable career plateau that will
provide and promote financial freedom through motivational and inspirational support,
ultimately leading to a hopeful, healthy, and well balanced life. The
focus of being well balanced and financially free to take care of life's basic
needs and being the best mom one can be is a constant struggle for many
mothers. The event is to take place in the summer of 2016 in Oakland
  County, Michigan.The event will consist of motivational speakers
that will address stress management, time management and career planning
strategies. A financial advisor will provide financial planning tips. The
gathering will provide the audience with the knowledge and opportunity to
network with people who share similar circumstances, and to help better cope with being a single mother. The event will also give an inner voice  to inspire, encourage, and show single mothers
that with determination, many things are possible. As part of the event, some
of the proceeds will be awarded in the form of a  scholarship to one
single mother who has chosen to pursue a cosmetology licensed career in Michigan.  Pursuing a cosmetology license gives a sense of independence, however,  it does not limit one to pursuing an advanced career or further ones
education in the future in any field of interest or passion. The four hour event is expected to have participants of approximately 50-60 people.
Having
the opportunity to host such an event will allow lives to be changed through
the caring power of community involvement, a strong support system, and
respecting the worth and dignity of every person. It will inspire single
mothers with ambition, to rise above the odds and sometimes negative
connotation associated with being a single mom. 
 
The magnitude of what you will help us achieve:
When you donate, sponsor, or support Single Moms with A Determined Spirits'
event,  you encourage women who sacrifice
every day to take an inner look at themselves and see their potential.  All contributions will help meet pressing
needs and encourage the single moms to either go back to school , earn a
certificate or a degree, or explore other
career opportunities that offer a sustainable
income. This event will also allow the participant to attain financial planning
strategies, and bond with other single moms in the community for support and
care.

Part of the
contributions will aid in supporting and inspiring one single mother who
demonstrates an ambition to pursue  a
cosmetology license hence, giving her a sense of accomplishing something greater
for herself and her family.
The amount of $5,000 is being requested for the event. A portion of
the donation will aid towards the preparation
of the event and the remainder of the donation will be allocated in the form of
a scholarship to one single mom who shows an interest in and determination in
pursuing a career in cosmetology to better her life.  The process in choosing the recipient for
the scholarship involves the contestants to write a 250 word essay demonstrating
how the scholarship would help fund and contribute to their schooling.


    
The Impact:
Your contribution will help change many single mothers' lives through
the positive and valuable resources that would be provided at the event.  These resources will allow single moms to
know that they are not alone and the event will impact their life's  journey,  which contributes to society as a whole. This is our first
time hosting such an event and with the help from our contributors we hope it
will foster future annual events. 

Risks & Challenges:

We are aware that there might be risks and
challenges in putting an event together and funding an event. But as single
moms, determination and will power is part of our existence. As we launch this
campaign, the obstacles we face will be documented as well as our solutions to
solve these problems.  This event has been in the planning phase for quite awhile with much fore thoughts.  With such an event it is hard to predict
any issues or challenges that might arise, however, with the help of the
committee members a solution will be put into place adequately.

<h3></h3><h3>Background of the Phillipines project</h3>
<p>During the April and October 2014 trip, Ibasho team has assessed the needs of elders in 5 communities that were affected by typhoon Yolanda in , and selected the community in the Bagong Buhay barangay, Ormoc because of the strong leadership of the community. </p>
<p>Ibasho also appointed a local Ibasho coordinator who would be working with the elders to guide the Ibasho project next two years. Ibasho recognized that developing a livelihood project for the elders who were affected by the Typhoon Yolanda was critical and requires immediate attention.</p>
<p>Following the assessment of community needs and their capacity through several workshops and meetings, Ibasho team suggested the initial scope of work and estimated cost for the physical infrastructure part of this project. It is important to note that these suggested projects are emerged directly from the input of elders in the Bagong Buhay Barangay.</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p></p>
Elders can become catalysts for connecting people of all ages in the community. However, older people are more often thought of as in need of care than as a resource to support younger generations. <p></p>
<p>Ibasho project empowers and includes elders throughout the process, from development to operation, <b>reversing the common social perception of elders from being cared for to caring for and contributing to the community</b>. Elders are encouraged to take a leadership role in reinventing their communities.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In 2013, Ibasho and the community Ofunato in Japan jointly created the concept of an “Ibasho café”, staffed by elder volunteers, that would <b>serve as a community hub and a focal point of the recovery effort</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Watch a story of the first Ibasho café project in the Tsunami and Earthquake stricken city of Ofunato, Japan. Since 2013, the Ibasho café has been successfully run by elders, connecting generations and transferring elders'  wisdom and knowledge in the local community.</p>

In 2013, Ibasho and the community Ofunato in Japan jointly created the concept of an “Ibasho café”, staffed by elder volunteers, that would serve as a community hub and a focal point of the recovery effort. 

Watch a story of the first Ibasho café project in the Tsunami and Earthquake stricken city of Ofunato, Japan. Since 2013, the Ibasho café has been successfully run by elders, connecting generations and transferring elders'  wisdom and knowledge in the local community.








Milestone of the first Ibasho project in Japan:


Elders organized 330 events and welcomed more than 11,000 visitors since 2013. 

Elders started organic farm, farmer’s market, noodle shop, and child day care. 

Elders Learned to apply for grants proposals. 

Elders traveled to Philippines to help set up the second Ibasho project

Elders participated in the UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction to share their experiences.

        Hello!,

<div>
        Wet Sock Interactive is a new company from The Netherlands founded on the 10th of December 2014, we want to create tools for developers, games and mobile apps. Our app division will do business as 'Intrinsic Apps'.</div>
<p>
        We have several concepts written down but we haven't managed to get enough money to sufficiently invest in things such as: licences, tools, marketing and graphic design. And we also need to eat.
    </p>
<p>We want to sell:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Useful and painless tools to help developers.</span>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Feature rich apps which offer a full experience.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Enjoyable indie games.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<i>We plan to release several apps in 2015 and possibly our first PC game if money and time is available (we have the concept but we lack the funds for things such as graphic design).</i>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
        There is a long road ahead and we want to grow into a bigger company with a supportive environment for other developers. Which turns exciting ideas into enjoyable products.
    </div>
<div>
        We want to set ourselves apart from the competition by really focusing on what our users enjoy and by offering them a full, feature rich experience with good usability.</div>

</div>
<div>
        We can't thank you enough for your investment in our future. Because it helps us achieve our dreams and makes it possible for us to make the software we want: feature rich apps, useful and painless tools for developers and enjoyable games. All for affordable prices.

</div></div>","Hello!,
    

        Wet Sock Interactive is a new company from The Netherlands founded on the 10th of December 2014, we want to create tools for developers, games and mobile apps. Our app division will do business as 'Intrinsic Apps'.

        We have several concepts written down but we haven't managed to get enough money to sufficiently invest in things such as: licences, tools, marketing and graphic design. And we also need to eat.
    
We want to sell:



Useful and painless tools to help developers.



Feature rich apps which offer a full experience.


Enjoyable indie games.



We plan to release several apps in 2015 and possibly our first PC game if money and time is available (we have the concept but we lack the funds for things such as graphic design).



        There is a long road ahead and we want to grow into a bigger company with a supportive environment for other developers. Which turns exciting ideas into enjoyable products.
    

        We want to set ourselves apart from the competition by really focusing on what our users enjoy and by offering them a full, feature rich experience with good usability.

Since then, they have spread around the world, but they have only hit the US in the last couple of years in states like California and New York, and in large metropolitan areas. In December 2014, the first cat café in New York City opened its doors to a huge crowd (a lot of whom waited hours to get inside). They also accepted appointments, and they were booked up immediately.</p><p>So the desire for these cat cafes is there and growing, but alas, there are none in Texas, so let's make one! San Antonio is already a city with a couple of million residents, a booming tourist economy, major theme parks, and a growing pet market, and with your help, a cat cafe. We would be first on the scene in this part of the country... the only cat cafe for a thousand miles. Wow!</p><p>We've done extensive research and planning, have a business plan, marketing plan, know our market well, have a prime location picked out with heavy walking traffic in a retail center in an affluent area, and just need the money to turn our vision into a reality. There is a real need for premium cat foods and supplies, as well as community education regarding TNR projects, cat health and wellness, fostering and adoption programs, and cat socialization issues. Because we recognize the magnitude and importance of such needs, we aim to address all of these in a friendly and welcoming environment. We are a woman-owned small business with all the proper resale certificates and business licenses, and we also are working with a local non-profit to handle the adoptions. The business owner has decades of experience with cats and has been a businesswoman and entrepreneur since 1999. So, rest assured. This isn't some fly-by-night operation thought up late one night last week. This has been in the works for over a year, because experienced and successful business owners know research and thoughtful planning take time.</p><p>What would you be helping us build? Well, let us walk you through it. Upon entering our establishment, you will be greeted with a smile, and you will have several options available. You can shop for premium cat foods, health and wellness products, and learn more about grain-free and raw food choices for starters. If you own a cat (or are thinking about adopting one), we will offer classes to educate you on a multitude of topics, including Kitten Kindergarten for new kitten owners. If you want to interact with our kitties, you can pay a small fee to pet and cuddle with them while you kick back on our comfy couches and chairs, read a book, watch a movie, play on your tablet, or take cute kitty pics-- all in an effort help them become socialized for adoption. And petting cats lowers your stress level and blood pressure, by the way.</p><p>If you are allergic to cats, or think you might be, don't  worry. You can browse around or take a class in the main part of the store and cafe because the cats are in a glassed-in area which you can enter by choice.
