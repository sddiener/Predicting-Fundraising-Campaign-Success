<h3>The Bike Date Project becomes a Calendar!</h3>

<p>Three years ago an

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Women and Trans Bike Night is a weekly do-it-yourself volunteer-driven bicycle mechanic session with trained volunteers. We believe that it is important to share our skills about bicycle maintenance as a means of transportation and fun as women, gender-variant and trans folks.</p>
<p>We are running a team (called 'Nightriders) in a 100km bicycle marathon in support of Out On The Shelf, our local indepentent LGBTQ library.</p>
<p>Out On The Shelf will be moving soon and we want to give them the boost that they need to move into a new space.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We plan on running six people in the 'Nightriders bike team at the OOTS bike marathon fundraiser. Our goal is to raise $250 per person. You - our friends, family, supporters, admirers and allies - will help us to get there by pitching what you can into the bucket. Everything that we raise will go to OOTS.</p>
<p>As a thank you, we will be hand-crafting each of our perks - from laminated spoke cards that have our logo on them (they're called ""spoke cards"" because you weave them into your spokes) to buttons and t-shirts. If you carry us all the way to the finish line, we'll even give you a bicycle - built up by us, of course!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Both the Women and Trans Bike Night and Out On The Shelf are volunteer-driven, independently-funded entities. Without the community, these places sheerly wouldn't exist. Check out our intro video to find out why these spaces are so important.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate your support in all of its forms! You can drop by Women and Trans Night (Thursdays 5pm-8pm, 620 Gordon St, Guelph ON) to work on your bicycle or just to say hi.</p>
<p>Please also share this campaign on Facebook, through email or twitter. Every little bit helps!</p>

I grew up in an auto racing family and choose a different path in life.  Running became my passion and I won the state Junior Olympic mile championship in 1978.  A car accident resulted in a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) that changed the course of my life.  After years of recovery and emotional distress, I decided to modify a racecar to assist the physically challenged. Seeing the look on other disabled peoples’ faces when they took a ride in my NASCAR racecar was a life changing experience for me. Improving somebody’s quality of life in this way is more fulfilling then any self help book or organization I learned of in 30 years.  I want to continue sharing with others what has been a gift from God to me.</p>

<p>The Accessible Racing NASCAR driving experience provides an exciting and therapeutic experience that helps disabled individuals rediscover their capabilities.  It opens up the possibilities in their lives after an accident, illness or injury. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Accessible Racing has been featured in numerous high profile news stories covering our disabled driving experiences.  SPEED Associate Producer Justin Burnett was honored with a 2012 Russ Catlin Award for his Veteran's Day 2011 feature on Accessible Racing that ran as part of the popular program, NASCAR Race Hub.  ""For me, this piece crystallizes everything that makes racing, and sports in general, great"", said Burnett, ""Far away from the bright spotlight of a NASCAR race weekend, Accessible Racing is using their passion for racing as a vehicle for inspiration and change.”</p>

<h3>The Impact on Disabled Driving Experience Participants</h3>
<p>Rehabilitation professionals recognize the importance of sports and recreation in the successful rehabilitation of individuals with disabilities. When first faced with the reality of a disability, many experience a loss of confidence, depression, and believe their lives have ended. They are often alienated from family and friends because there are no shared positive experiences.  Physical and emotional rehabilitation need to begin in the recovery stage before victims dwell on the mental list of things they can no longer do.   </p>
<p>Sports and recreation offers the opportunity to achieve success in a very short time period; to use this success to build self-confidence and focus on possibilities instead of dwelling on what can no longer be done. The ability to participate in a sport, such as auto racing, snowmobiling, or jet skiing, to name a few, provides the opportunity to reunite with family and friends in a shared activity.</p>
<p>Competition improves sports skills. It allows individuals to experience the excitement of competition and the thrill of victory, as well as the agony of defeat. These experiences help prepare individuals after rehabilitation to face the adversity of a disability in their lives and to learn to bounce back in the face of challenge and change.</p>
<p>Accessible Racing is a media magnet and has been featured multiple times on national TV on Memorial Day Weekend and Veterans Day. Our events bring valuable awareness and media coverage to support disabled civilians and veterans.  Your contribution will help us continue this positive impact!</p>

<h3><strong>About us</strong></h3>
<p>McGill Formula Electric is an engineering design team made up of over 50 motivated students from various faculties at McGill and united by the challenge of building a completely electric formula-style racecar to compete at Formula SAE competitions against universities from around the world.</p>
<h3><strong>How Your Donations Help</strong></h3>
<p>In an effort to increase reliability and performance, this year, we have opted for a shortened manufacturing schedule, thereby allowing for more testing and practice. Such a high-pace schedule brings increased manufacturing costs. Additionally, a longer testing and competition season requires large amounts of funds to finance upkeep, travel and replacement of used components such as our tires.</p>
<p>On top of this, building a race car from scratch requires large amounts of resources and high-tech equipment. For example, our electronics system is composed of hundreds of individual components and  requires several thousand dollars worth of component and manufacturing costs. The batteries themselves, an indispensable part of an electric vehicle, cost over $6000.</p>
<h3><strong>The Dream</strong></h3>
<p>McGill Formula Electric has a long history of building electric vehicles. McGill was the first University to build an electric snowmobile back in 2004. Over its 10 year history the McGill snowmobile has traveled the world, from carrying the Olympic Torch for the 2010 Vancouver Games, to being used for climate change research in Greenland. The team has finished 1st at the SAE Clean Snowmobile Challenge a total of 3 times. The team additionally competed in the inaugural Formula Hybrid competition in 2007. The experience gained in electric powertrain development has been the driving factor of the team’s success over the years. The McGill Hybrid car claimed 2 first place finishes in its 6 years of competing. However, trophies are not the only measure of success: we hold ourselves to a very high standard and take pride and enjoyment in the quality, efficiency and performance of our electric vehicles.</p>
<p>We now want to be able to live up to our past excellence with our Formula Electric vehicles and once again be one of the top contenders at all competitions. The North American Formula Electric competition is currently lagging behind the European competitions, both in the number of participants and the level of competition. Our goal is to bridge this gap and become a contender on the world stage where we can prove our excellence and passion for clean energy transportation.</p>
<h3><strong>General Motors Canada</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign was made possible thanks the generous support of General Motors Canada, which has agreed to match every dollar donated as well as provide prizes as an incentive to donate. By supporting Electric and Hybrid FSAE teams, General Motors Canada is ensuring that the next generation of students will be have both a passion and a deep understanding of sustainable transportation technologies. With their continued support of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) initiatives, they aid in providing opportunities for students to learn, grow, and create.</p>

<p><br/></p> <p>I'm Okami! I'm an artist!<br/><br/></p>
<p>I rely on my vehicle for <b>everything</b>. Getting to work. Getting to doctor's offices and medications filled to secure my livelihood. Getting food. Pretty much surviving in general. I live in an area where the public transportation system isn't great, so having a working vehicle is of the utmost importance to me. :c I don't need a fancy car. Just something that works, and is a good long-term investment.  That's what my current car was. But then a horrible string of events happened <b>all in one day</b>! </p>
<ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455993660/huhcxpbw1fzx6tn35ho2.png"" src="""" style=""width: 580.054px; height: 584px;""/></p> </ul> <p>This happened <b>all in the span of 5 hours</b>. Talk about bad luck.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Want to Do About This!</h3> <p>I need another car <i>pronto</i>! After a diagnosis from a mechanic, it turns out I have a <b>blown head gasket</b>. They could rebuild to engine or replace it altogether, but that costs a <b>LOT</b> more money than just replacing the car altogether. </p>
<p>To prevent myself from losing a lot more than just my car, I'm turning to you guys for help! I've scoured craigslist for used cars and the like, and it seems the ballpark figure for a <b><i>decent </i>used car is $2000-$4000</b>. </p>
<p>Of course all cars are not without problems, and used cars can come with other problems, but I simply can't afford to wait this out. I have a lot at stake right now! <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">D:</span></p>
<p>What I am willing to do should I raise enough money to get another car is return the favor to you guys! What does this mean?</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Free stuff from me and other artists!</b> We work really hard to give you guys quality content, and we're willing to work even harder together to help me reach my goal! <b>This includes awesome artists like myself</b>, <b>Nekophelia</b>, <b>Laraye, Pandacorn, Argoth, Awkturtleartist, ThatAndyGuy, MShadowy, and </b><b>BarretXIII!</b><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>As stretch goals are met, more free stuff comes with it! <b>If we can reach a certain stretch goal, I'll even release the next image pack COMPLETELY FREE to everyone! </b><br/><br/>
</li> <li>If i don't reach my goal, I'll work with what you guys are willing to contribute to see if I can find other transportation options in the meantime. It'll be difficult, and I don't know what will happen, but <b>we can't say we didn't try!</b>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What Happens if the Goal is Met?</h3> <p>If I am able to get another car with you guys, I will:</p> <ul> <li><b>FIRST TAKE A PICTURE OF IT TO SHOW YOU GUYS IN AN UPDATE HOLY CRAP I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER!</b></li> <li>As with my previous campaign, I will work diligently to make sure all perks are met through myself and other artists as well. If anything happens, I will of course keep you guys updated!</li> <li><b>I WON'T BE STRESSED OUT FOREVER AND I CAN GET TO WORK AND GO TO CONS AND SEE YOU GUYS!</b></li>
</ul>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;""> <p>As of right now, I'm stuck at home. I do have some necessities at the moment, and friends help out when and if they can, but ultimately I will need to get back on the road in another car, else I could lose a lot. ;___;</p>

I'm an artist!
I rely on my vehicle for everything. Getting to work. Getting to doctor's offices and medications filled to secure my livelihood. Getting food. Pretty much surviving in general. I live in an area where the public transportation system isn't great, so having a working vehicle is of the utmost importance to me. :c I don't need a fancy car. Just something that works, and is a good long-term investment.  That's what my current car was. But then a horrible string of events happened all in one day! 

  This happened all in the span of 5 hours. Talk about bad luck.   What I Want to Do About This! I need another car pronto! After a diagnosis from a mechanic, it turns out I have a blown head gasket. They could rebuild to engine or replace it altogether, but that costs a LOT more money than just replacing the car altogether. 
To prevent myself from losing a lot more than just my car, I'm turning to you guys for help! I've scoured craigslist for used cars and the like, and it seems the ballpark figure for a decent used car is $2000-$4000. 
Of course all cars are not without problems, and used cars can come with other problems, but I simply can't afford to wait this out. I have a lot at stake right now!  D:
What I am willing to do should I raise enough money to get another car is return the favor to you guys! What does this mean?  
Free stuff from me and other artists! We work really hard to give you guys quality content, and we're willing to work even harder together to help me reach my goal! This includes awesome artists like myself, Nekophelia, Laraye, Pandacorn, Argoth, Awkturtleartist, ThatAndyGuy, MShadowy, and BarretXIII!

As stretch goals are met, more free stuff comes with it! If we can reach a certain stretch goal, I'll even release the next image pack COMPLETELY FREE to everyone! 
 If i don't reach my goal, I'll work with what you guys are willing to contribute to see if I can find other transportation options in the meantime. It'll be difficult, and I don't know what will happen, but we can't say we didn't try!
    What Happens if the Goal is Met? If I am able to get another car with you guys, I will:  FIRST TAKE A PICTURE OF IT TO SHOW YOU GUYS IN AN UPDATE HOLY CRAP I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER! As with my previous campaign, I will work diligently to make sure all perks are met through myself and other artists as well. If anything happens, I will of course keep you guys updated! I WON'T BE STRESSED OUT FOREVER AND I CAN GET TO WORK AND GO TO CONS AND SEE YOU GUYS!

 As of right now, I'm stuck at home. I do have some necessities at the moment, and friends help out when and if they can, but ultimately I will need to get back on the road in another car, else I could lose a lot. ;___;

Stretch Goals!




$5000 - Okami Gets to Ride in Style!

I get a car that is awesome! Like this! Holy crap! The art pack is free, you guys vote on the theme and some characters to be included, AND there's another bonus in store that'll involve a big artist~ What is it? We'll find out! c:
$4000 - It Looks Awesome and Won't Fall Apart!


Yayyy! i won't be worried about any repairs anytime soon! Also, for us reaching this milestone, the next image pack I release will be released completely free for everyone! There will even be a SFW version! And you guys vote on the theme and some characters as well! AWESOME! It'll also feature work from some other artists as well! 
$3000 - It Runs and it Looks OK!


I can now get something like this! I will work with a mechanic buddy to make sure the car will be the best I can get for the money we've raised! Additionally, all of you guys will get to vote on the theme of the content of the next image pack and also vote for some characters you would like to see in it as well! 
    Other Ways You Can Help! Can't contribute? That's ok! By simply sharing this campaign with others, you're still helping me! Share it on Facebook, Google+, Reddit, anywhere! Don't spam though. Spam is bad D;  Let's get me back on the road!Here's a list of the artists that are helping me out! They are also spending some of their precious time to help me by offering rewards as a perk for helping me out!

<p>I created the CycleBoard because I was looking for a better way for my family and I to travel and go on outings in our local area. I wanted something that was safe and fun, but also something that inspired togetherness. My wife and I have 3 kids and we all love riding. CycleBoarding has already become a household name and activity in our family, and I hope that it will in yours too! </p>
<p><b>ABOUT CYCLEBOARD</b></p>
<p>CycleBoard was founded and created by Phil LaBonty. Based out of Newport Beach, California, CycleBoard is comprised of a team of entrepreneurs, engineers and designers, creating 3-wheeled electric devices that transform the way people travel in their local environments. CycleBoard is a remarkably intuitive, lean-to-steer electric vehicle that goes up to 20 mph and is incredibly safe and fun. CycleBoard is the first product in our line-up with more to follow.</p>
<h1>WHY WE’RE KICKSTARTING</h1>
<p>We have been self-funding the development of CycleBoard up until this point. Our team comes with extensive experience in product design, engineering and manufacturing. Your contribution to this campaign will allow us to open tooling and move directly into production. We appreciate your consideration and look forward to you becoming one of the very first owners of the amazing new CycleBoard. </p>

<p><b>Can I ride my CycleBoard like a kick scooter? </b></p>
<p><i>Yes, absolutely. The CycleBoard free wheels very well so you are covered if you want to mix in some exercise or if you run out of battery. </i></p>
<p><b>What are the battery and charger specifications?</b></p>
<p><i>Each CycleBoard comes equipped with a 48v 10ah battery pack and a standard 2 amp charger with an approximate recharge time of 3-5 hours, or you can upgrade to a 3 amp charger with an approximate recharge time of 2-3 hours. </i></p>

<p><b>Can I take the battery out of the scooter?</b></p>
<p><i>The battery is protected inside the sealed aluminum chassis underneath the riding deck. It’s not meant to be removed unless the battery needs to be replaced. The battery charger is plugged into a port on the side of the chassis underneath the riding deck to charge your battery. </i></p>
<p><b>Can I buy an extra charger or battery?</b></p>
<p><i>Yes, we will provide replacement parts for your CycleBoard. An additional battery would only be needed if the original battery needed to be replaced, as they are not meant to be swapped out. However, we will make them available later on just in case. In terms of chargers, you’ll be able to purchase as many standard (2 amp) or upgraded (3 amp) chargers as you like.</i></p>
<p><b>How does the battery work? </b></p>
<p><i>To recharge your CycleBoard’s battery, simply plug it into any standard outlet. </i></p>

<p><b>What happens if my CycleBoard stops working?</b></p>
<p><i>We provide an owner’s manual with every purchase describing all details of the CycleBoard along with troubleshooting practices. There are 6 major mechanical and electronic components: throttle, hand brake lever, brake caliper, controller, battery and motor. All parts are easy to replace and we will send out replacement parts when necessary. </i></p>
<p><b>How do I turn it on and off?</b></p>
<p><i>Turning on your CycleBoard is as simple as pushing a button. Just push the on/off button on the throttle. </i></p>
<p><b>Do I need a special license to operate CycleBoard? </b></p>
<p><i>Each country, state and city has its own laws and restrictions. We strongly advise the use of safety equipment, such as helmets. Please review your local motor vehicle rules and laws. </i></p>
<p><b>How much does the full scooter weigh?</b></p>
<p><i>Each CycleBoard weighs approximately 42 lbs. </i></p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty? </b></p>
<p><i>We offer a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty for any design defects and on all parts. </i></p>
<p><b>Is the CycleBoard waterproof?</b></p>
<p><i>The rear hub motor is completely sealed and nearly waterproof, although we don’t suggest submerging the entire motor in water or riding through large puddles. The battery compartment is completely contained and sealed within the aluminum chassis body and is water resistant.  However, please keep in mind that the CycleBoard is an electronic device.</i></p>
<p><b>What if I want to clean my CycleBoard?</b></p>

It is a foot forward design, so your feet are always in front of you. This combined with an upright handlebar position rocks you back onto your sit bones and keeps you in a much more comfortable position. </p><p>The seat is designed for comfort, not speed. Think of a beach cruiser saddle, wide and comfortable. The seat is a very special tapered design that allows a narrower front section for smaller riders and a wider rear section for larger, taller riders. It is constructed with high density foam. This is truly one of the most comfortable bikes you will ever ride.</p><p>** In final production the seat will be 3/4"" narrower in the front.  This will make it more comfortable for smaller riders and allow even easier pedaling for riders of all sizes!</p><p>It is also one the most reliable bikes you can buy. You never need to worry about your seat being stolen and If you have friends over most can ride the bike without any adjustments!</p><p><strong>Q:  Why do you use those wide 4 inch tires?</strong></p><p>A:  The 4.0 tires serve two purposes. First they hardly ever need air compared to a 2.0 tire, which needs to be filled up weekly. Second they roll super smooth and stay in motion very easily. If you live near the beach you can ride them on the sand as well. Less flats and more air equals more time on the bike and less time pumping and repairing!</p><p><strong>Q:  This bike would be a cool electric bike. Any thoughts on that?</strong></p><p>A:  Funny you should ask! The Capuchin will come with battery mounts and cable guides already  installed so that in the near future when we offer our electric motor kit the Capuchin will be 100% compatible. You will just mount the battery and install the 350W electric motor rear wheel and you will be ready to go.</p><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489249508/ywpikciifte3imue34xd.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489254637/kroawtii95qs7lmkfshk.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div> </div><h3><strong>Features on the Monkey Faction Capuchin:</strong></h3><p>The Shimano trigger shifters are easily operated with the touch of a finger.

<h3><strong>FINALLY -  A BETTER WAY TO LUBRICATE A BIKE CHAIN.</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.leftfielddesign.net/images/643_12-0901_NDCL-TicMarks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><em>The applicator rotates closed to prevent leaking. You don't need much lubricant - just one tick-mark. </em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY THIS IS THE BEST CHAIN LUBE TOOL OUT THERE:</h2>
<p>Drip bottles are time consuming - you've got to put a drip on each side of each link in the chain.</p>
<p>Spray cans are messy!</p>
<p>Lubricating your chain is a pain.  Until now:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.leftfielddesign.net/images/341_NDCL_Logo_TM.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>MAKES LUBING YOUR CHAIN AS FAST AND EASY AS RIDING A BIKE AND AS FUN (well, almost!)</strong></p>
<p><strong>NO DRIPPING, NO OVER-SPRAY, NO MESS TO CLEAN UP</strong></p>
<p><strong>WORKS WITH ANY LOW-VISCOSITY LIQUID BIKE LUBRICANT</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAVES LUBRICANT = GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.leftfielddesign.net/images/360_12-0831_NDCL-LineDwg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""> </p>
<p><strong>CLEAN AND SIMPLE. </strong> Fill the bottle, not quite full, with your favorite lubricant, and tightly screw on the applicator cap.  Open the applicator so it's straight-up.  With the bottle upside-down, hold the absorbent pad against the chain.  The applicator's guide ribs keep the Luber on the chain.  While backpedaling the chain, give the bottle a gentle squeeze, or two.  You don't need much lubricant.  Spin the chain a complete cycle - or two, if needed - and you're ready to ride!  Rotate the applicator down and into the cap to prevent leaking.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 210px;""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.leftfielddesign.net/images/141_12-0826_Bottle_cap.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

FINALLY -  A BETTER WAY TO LUBRICATE A BIKE CHAIN.

The applicator rotates closed to prevent leaking. You don't need much lubricant - just one tick-mark. 
 
WHY THIS IS THE BEST CHAIN LUBE TOOL OUT THERE:
Drip bottles are time consuming - you've got to put a drip on each side of each link in the chain.
Spray cans are messy!
Lubricating your chain is a pain.  Until now:

MAKES LUBING YOUR CHAIN AS FAST AND EASY AS RIDING A BIKE AND AS FUN (well, almost!)
NO DRIPPING, NO OVER-SPRAY, NO MESS TO CLEAN UP
WORKS WITH ANY LOW-VISCOSITY LIQUID BIKE LUBRICANT
SAVES LUBRICANT = GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

 
CLEAN AND SIMPLE.  Fill the bottle, not quite full, with your favorite lubricant, and tightly screw on the applicator cap.  Open the applicator so it's straight-up.  With the bottle upside-down, hold the absorbent pad against the chain.  The applicator's guide ribs keep the Luber on the chain.  While backpedaling the chain, give the bottle a gentle squeeze, or two.  You don't need much lubricant.  Spin the chain a complete cycle - or two, if needed - and you're ready to ride!  Rotate the applicator down and into the cap to prevent leaking.

A ""DOSAGE"" SCALE ON THE LABEL SHOWS JUST HOW MUCH TO USE, so you don't use too much!  Each tick mark equals approximately one chain lubrication.  The 2-ounce bottle includes the foam-lined travel cap, but not the  lubricant.

The No-Drip Chain Luber comes with five absorbent pads in a re-usable package. (Package shown with retail label.)
ABSORBENT PADS ARE LONG-LASTING AND REPLACEABLE.  Each pad lasts for about twenty chain lubes and can be flipped over for extended wear.

Additional replacement pads are packaged twelve per pack.
PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT AND PATENT

It took a few prototypes for the No-Drip Chain Luber to work just right. The design is now ready for production and patent pending!

<p></p><p>We are seeking 80,000 dollars to take the current technology to the
next level which will lift our UAV off the ground.  All of our testing has
achieved remarkable milestones aimed at the ultimate goal: a fully axial
controlled, artificially induced space warp craft.  Full funding will
allow us to proceed to the ultimate level: a full-sized pilot-controlled ship. </p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/894786/files/20140930194920-444.png?1412131760"" src="""" style=""width: 196.457627118644px; height: 201px;""/></p>
<p></p><p>Take up our offer to be a part of history! Here is your
opportunity to bring the world into the 21<sup>st</sup>Century with warp drive technology.  It is you, the public,
who can bring this project to fruition- no government or non-government
organization; just you.  To know that your donation will usher in a whole
new economy and the opportunity for not just a few, but for the many, to
experience a whole new way to travel around the world and into space, has to
excite you! Think of possibilities! </p>
<p>There are also tangible items you can get at various
contribution levels including, hats, T-shirts, mouse pads and patches.  These
are only tokens, but you can say that you were part of the biggest technical
revolution in the history of the human race.  We will put all contributors’
names on a small plaque on the first craft to go to space. Our company’s logo
is “Wave of the Future”.  If you want to be part of the future then please
join us now!</p>
<p>All funds will be applied to purchasing hardware to get our UAV
off the ground.  If we miss our goal, it will take longer, but we will not
quit. The UAV will lift off the ground and the rest will be history. Join us!</p><br/>
<p><b><u>The Impact of Space Warp Technology</u></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/894789/files/20140930195003-555.png?1412131803"" src="""" style=""width: 303.347639484979px; height: 228px;""/></p>
<p></p><p>Our warp drive will change both terrestrial and space
transportation.  Bending the fabric of space works equally well in the
atmosphere as in a space environment.  The cost to transport materials
into space can drop from $30,000 to less than $10.00 per pound. </p>
<p>Our warp engine design is a modular configuration that will be
retrofitted to existing aircraft. The fuel savings will have a tremendously
positive economic impact and will reduce atmospheric pollution of the upper
atmosphere.  With over seven thousand aircraft airborne at any given time,
think of what it would mean to fly around the world at a cost that is reduced
to the purchase of a bus ticket between Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
<p>Space warp technology will facilitate the establishment of space
stations as well as the colonization of planets, moons and asteroids.  The
space warp motor will provide a fast and dependable mechanism for logistical
support for humans to navigate the solar system and beyond.</p>
<p><b><u>The Greatest Challenge</u></b></p>
<p>After nine years of research we have produced the technology
people have dreamed about- a low powered functional warp drive.  Help us
scale up the technology, lift our UAV off the ground and apply what we learn to
both terrestrial and space transportation.</p>
<p>The main obstacle every new technology encounters are the people
who cannot recognize the paradigm shift.  Tesla and Edison experienced
this in the debate over Alternating Current versus Direct Current. Heavier than
air flight was once thought to be impossible.  The same thing will happen
with warp technology. The mainstream will only believe when they see the craft
lift off the ground. When that happens the situation will change very quickly.
Here is your chance to be at the forefront of the next great leap in
transportation.</p>
<p>Once the funding is in place we will get the craft off the
ground.  Next, we will market the technology, provide visual
demonstrations and generate sales in order to get a craft into space!</p>

SPACE WARP DYNAMICS, LLC is prototyping an innovative Space Warp
Drive Motor.  Laboratory experiments have demonstrated the existence of an
artificially induced space warp- the bending of the fabric of space. This
product will revolutionize terrestrial and space transportation. While the
physics is complex, the device is uncomplicated and has been engineered to be
highly reliable.  The motor currently has a registered patent pending
number (61/960001).

Goals for this Project
We are seeking 80,000 dollars to take the current technology to the
next level which will lift our UAV off the ground.  All of our testing has
achieved remarkable milestones aimed at the ultimate goal: a fully axial
controlled, artificially induced space warp craft.  Full funding will
allow us to proceed to the ultimate level: a full-sized pilot-controlled ship. 
Take up our offer to be a part of history! Here is your
opportunity to bring the world into the 21stCentury with warp drive technology.  It is you, the public,
who can bring this project to fruition- no government or non-government
organization; just you.  To know that your donation will usher in a whole
new economy and the opportunity for not just a few, but for the many, to
experience a whole new way to travel around the world and into space, has to
excite you! Think of possibilities! 
There are also tangible items you can get at various
contribution levels including, hats, T-shirts, mouse pads and patches.  These
are only tokens, but you can say that you were part of the biggest technical
revolution in the history of the human race.  We will put all contributors’
names on a small plaque on the first craft to go to space. Our company’s logo
is “Wave of the Future”.  If you want to be part of the future then please
join us now!
All funds will be applied to purchasing hardware to get our UAV
off the ground.  If we miss our goal, it will take longer, but we will not
quit. The UAV will lift off the ground and the rest will be history. Join us!
The Impact of Space Warp Technology
Our warp drive will change both terrestrial and space
transportation.  Bending the fabric of space works equally well in the
atmosphere as in a space environment.  The cost to transport materials
into space can drop from $30,000 to less than $10.00 per pound. 
Our warp engine design is a modular configuration that will be
retrofitted to existing aircraft. The fuel savings will have a tremendously
positive economic impact and will reduce atmospheric pollution of the upper
atmosphere.  With over seven thousand aircraft airborne at any given time,
think of what it would mean to fly around the world at a cost that is reduced
to the purchase of a bus ticket between Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska.
Space warp technology will facilitate the establishment of space
stations as well as the colonization of planets, moons and asteroids.  The
space warp motor will provide a fast and dependable mechanism for logistical
support for humans to navigate the solar system and beyond.
The Greatest Challenge
After nine years of research we have produced the technology
people have dreamed about- a low powered functional warp drive.  Help us
scale up the technology, lift our UAV off the ground and apply what we learn to
both terrestrial and space transportation.
The main obstacle every new technology encounters are the people
who cannot recognize the paradigm shift.  Tesla and Edison experienced
this in the debate over Alternating Current versus Direct Current. Heavier than
air flight was once thought to be impossible.  The same thing will happen
with warp technology. The mainstream will only believe when they see the craft
lift off the ground. When that happens the situation will change very quickly.
Here is your chance to be at the forefront of the next great leap in
transportation.
Once the funding is in place we will get the craft off the
ground.  Next, we will market the technology, provide visual
demonstrations and generate sales in order to get a craft into space!
Spread the Word on Space Warp
Please help us spread the word! Tell everyone you know about our
Space Warp Project. Use the Indiegogo share tools to tell you friends,
relatives and neighbors. Together, we can change the world.

<p>Riding a regular commuter e-bike at 25km/h on cobblestoned streets in Milan can be unnerving. Due to the constant tire deflection from the uneven surfaces, even with conventional suspension forks, this trait is especially amplified under hard braking. With this in mind, we designed a Girder fork from scratch with a unique linkage geometry, allowing us to finely tune it to the Buzzraw X to work in harmony. All that resulted in a consistent trail throughout its 80mm of suspension travel even during braking, allowing the Buzzraw X to glide over road gaps and bumps with ease and comfort while maintaining full control at all times.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554109549/zhuo25ftdslxyhevwdic.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Designed with user serviceability and customisability in mind we decided to incorporate a conventional shock mount sizing for our rear suspension and BuzzWalker Front fork. This would allow you to choose from a wide verity of off the shelf shocks, be it a coil shock with titanium spring, rock hard steel for those heavy hits or a feathery light premium air shock we got you covered for options. So now, without the need to spend time on an arduous journey across the internet looking for that proprietary shock you could enjoy that time coasting on your bike!<br/> </p>

The Buzzraw X is both unique and practical. Combining suspension withfat tires, The Buzzraw X smooths out cobblestone roads and glides overpotholes with ease.




Origins of the Buzzraw X, Coast cycles Shares its journey towards the conceptualization of the Absolute Beast!  


Featuring Alex Jumelin, the Godfather of flatland BMX, Coast Cycles brand ambassador and Team rider. Introducing the Buzzraw X for the first time in Singapore. 

We created the Buzzraw X so that you want to take them out to ride. Bringing to you not only ergonomically but also fashionably designed electric bicycles that rival bespoke designs of the best in the world. People might say that we are extreme, but it’s a simple philosophy that drives us to work hard every day.From the drawing board to the first prototype to the final production model, we brainstorm, argue, discuss and concur only to repeat the process until we arrive at the ‘perfect’ bike. How ‘perfect’? It makes you want to get on, and ride.After all, Everybody Needs Some Time To Coast.
 
Long and oh-so comfy. It takes two, or even three, with kiddo up front.Who says riding is all about going solo?
Riding a regular commuter e-bike at 25km/h on cobblestoned streets in Milan can be unnerving. Due to the constant tire deflection from the uneven surfaces, even with conventional suspension forks, this trait is especially amplified under hard braking. With this in mind, we designed a Girder fork from scratch with a unique linkage geometry, allowing us to finely tune it to the Buzzraw X to work in harmony. All that resulted in a consistent trail throughout its 80mm of suspension travel even during braking, allowing the Buzzraw X to glide over road gaps and bumps with ease and comfort while maintaining full control at all times.
Designed with user serviceability and customisability in mind we decided to incorporate a conventional shock mount sizing for our rear suspension and BuzzWalker Front fork. This would allow you to choose from a wide verity of off the shelf shocks, be it a coil shock with titanium spring, rock hard steel for those heavy hits or a feathery light premium air shock we got you covered for options. So now, without the need to spend time on an arduous journey across the internet looking for that proprietary shock you could enjoy that time coasting on your bike! 
 Put together with ABEC industrial grade bearings, 4130 chromoly tubing, CNC'd 6061 T6 alloy Linkages with full stainless-steel hardware all work to achieve imperceptible break-away stiction, allowing the BuzzWalker fork phenomenal small bump sensitivity. 

Dual suspension, 80mm of linear front and rear travel to perfectly smooth out cobblestone roads and glide over potholes with ease.    
 The Coast Cycles custom reinforced racing grade slick tires give you all the advantages of larger tires, with unbelievably low rolling resistance. The multi-purpose compound gives unmatched grip in the dry while maintaining outstanding grip levels in the wet.The MISSION COMMAND takes racing and trail riding to the next level. With the newly updated continuous centre tread knobs, it’s now the definition of a fast rolling, excellent control fat bike tire. This new pattern offers an extremely smooth ride with plenty of grip to spare.CLEAN, SMOOTH, SIMPLENo lube required equals no grease stains. Sheds dirt and grime and cleaning with water is easy. Just get on it and ride. No chain equals no chain clatter. It’s spooky quiet. A Gates Carbon Drive System weighs less than a chain. Lighter weight means higher performance. The instant engagement and smooth feel are unlike anything you’ve experienced before. You’ve got to ride it to believe it. Power where you need itNo complicated mid-drive, no clunky transmission, just effortless power right where you need it. First, we built a mid-drive motor but weren’t happy with the bike’s performance. We test rode some front wheel motors currently on the market and it affected steering and traction. With a rear hub motor, outputting 250/750 watts in tandem with every pedal stroke, it delivers performance directly to the rear wheel, so it’s all “grip” and “go”, no hiccups or false starts.We give you up to 3 adjustable speed settings for your Buzzraw X and walk-assist.3: Getting from point A to B has never been easier.2: With 45 kilometres of range before a recharge, this mode is designed to stretch your horizons.1: The perfect balance between power and battery life, no math required.Walk-assist: Manoeuvre when off the bike - push a button and the bike slowly moves forward.Don't have space or a plug in your garage? Worry not! The 48V lithium-ion battery can be locked and removed from the Buzzraw X and taken inside to charge while at home, work, or anywhere else.   Because we see merits in both hub and mid-drive motors, we have developed the Buzzraw X to accommodate both variants. From a Parisian owner who prefers a single speed belt drive hub motor for simplicity to a Swiss commuter in Lucerne that will power up the mountains in his 10-speed mid-drive motor Buzzraw X. We want our customers to have the ability to customise their own unique Buzzraw X exactly the way they want it. 
 A conservative three-pronged approach is used to verify the design integrity of the Buzzraw X. Using computerized 3D design models, variations of the frame design are subjected to a series of FEA stress simulation and continuously optimized with attention to tubing and material selection.Frame prototypes are then welded and assembled to be mechanically tested for compliance to EN and ISO standards. After making it this far, the bike has to satisfy our team of professional butt-dynos, bike-abusers and artists in terms of ride quality, durability and sex appeal before it is considered fit for production.         “This is probably the coolest bike I’ve ever seen. Coast has really thought differently about bike design. So, rather than have the traditional diamond shape, well it’s got something completely different, but this is a bike designed for urban environments and to be really practical. Absolute beast!"" “For those unfamiliar with Coast Cycles, this brand is based in Singapore and has been doing this specific frame styles way before others caught up!"" “Out of all of the Buzzraw styled e-bikes out there, there has never been one with full suspension.

Coast Cycles also has a single-storey warehousing facility that is situated at the northern part of Singapore.Jump on, breathe in, and go. All you need is to feel the breeze.

We’re passionate about offering transportation alternatives, because efficiency is freedom.Maxwell Motorbikes was founded by Troy Rank with an obsession about efficient two wheeled travel and adventure. Troy has been designing Ebikes for 13 years. In 2014, after his riding over 4000 miles in less than a month on a world-record setting Ebike journey, he set out to create the best bikes for urban transportation and adventure touring.  Risks & ChallengesStoic is currently at the production stage but we need help to achieve volume production. We have spent over two years building and testing Stoic, and we're confident that the design is ready for everyone. Regardless, right now is a particularly challenging time in supply-chain and demand on each component is greater than ever. Rest assured, we have done a thorough job planning for these challenges and should be able to meet our current delivery targets. Our frames are already starting production and we can't wait to build them for you!",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Vostok</h3>
<p>Even with the great bicycle, there is still room for improvement! We are happy with the feedback received from the early adopters of the <strong>Vostok Rear Triangle </strong>and the<strong> Chain Tensioner</strong>. This feedback and experience producing standard OEM triangles give us the confidence to push forward and continue to offer our custom components to Brompton fans and enthusiasts worldwide. </p>
<p>With the quality steel main frame and a set of titanium extremities, your Brompton bicycle will last a lifetime: the variety of drivetrains and brake sets can be interchanged to suit a particular function. Have a Rohloff or Alfine rear wheel for touring vacations and a single speed disk brake wheel for urban assault!</p>
<h3>The Components</h3>
<p>The titanium extremities are the fork, the rear triangle and the mini-rack. These allow installation of the disk brake set and hubs with standard over locknut distance of <strong>135mm</strong>. In addition, we offer an aluminium <strong>Chain Tensioner</strong> to be used with a range of internal gear hubs and a <strong>Rear Derailleur Hanger </strong>for a cassette Brompton conversion. Our custom <strong>titanium fork hook</strong> makes the above setups possible even with the stock Brompton fork. </p>

<p>Vostok Chain Tensioner is designed to interface with our rear triangle. It has an adjustable chain line and a strong spring. Supplied with quality pulleys with ceramic bearings. This chain tensioner is sturdy and manufactured to last. The Chain Tensioner can be used with a new Rohloff's 58mm chain line (with supplied shortened axles) or, as standard, with Shimano hubs and other narrow chain lines.  </p>
<p><strong>The Chain Tensioner V2</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509918013/dpk8l3gxmmmdwsq3rgty.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Upgraded Chain Tensioner by Vostok. We reduced weight by 40%. The pulleys are now CNC custom made and feature a deeper tooth pattern. The supported chain line is from 43.5mm to 58mm, which covers all internal hubs (from Shimano hubs to all Rohloffs - new and older). </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Derailleur Hanger interfaces with the Vostok Triangle's dropout to allow Brompton cassette builds. With our titanium fork hook, there is enough clearance to fold the bicycle with a derailleur.</p>
<p><strong>Vostok Mini Rack</strong> </p>

<p>In two variants: stock Brompton rear triangle and the Vostok triangle. Weight: 200g; Maximum allowed carrying weight: 16 kg. Statically, the rear rack will hold a weight of 120kg (one can even stand on it), but we do not recommend you try this too often.</p>
<p>We believe this to be the best mini-rack for the stock Brompton, as well as the only OEM rack specific to the Vostok geometry. </p>
<p><strong>Vostok Front Cargo Ti Rack</strong></p>

<h2>Noordung - Joy in Journey</h2>
<p><br/>European and global metropolises from London and Berlin to San Francisco and Copenhagen are increasingly constructing a cycling culture and infrastructure. Trends show that, in the next few years, bicycles will overtake cars when it comes to mass means of transport. Although electric cars have gained media attention, the real electrical revolution in urban transport is happening in the bicycle industry. Here and now.</p>
<p>We created the Noordung company because we believe that the essence of urban transportation is not just about moving from one point to the other, but about enjoying the journey. Noordung is a company that solves the issues of urban cycling with a commitment to excellence of design, user experience and service design. We have created an innovative solution that connects cycling with music and sound.</p>
<p>Our main product is a luxury, smart urban superbicycle of the best quality featuring a multifunctional Boombox that creates an entirely new experience of urban cycling that has never been seen before.</p>
<p>Noordung superbicycle has been intensively developed for the past three years and, having set up an adequate environment, we will start a small-scale production in the beginning of Q2 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Reinventing the ride</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551788166/zrnqg7bd3hzsr0cot99r.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Ride Music</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Up to 100 hours of music through the state-of-the-art speakers, played from your phone.</strong></p>
<p>Noordung is a pioneer in joining music with cycling. The central part of Noordung Boombox are two 20 watt RMS speakers with a frequency range of 70 Hz – 20 kHz, which are tilted at a 45 degree angle toward the rider. Needless to say, they sound amazing! The speakers wirelessly connect to the riders smartphone and play all the music and sounds played on the smartphone. You can use the Boombox while riding as well as when it's detached from the bike, turning it into an excellent portable speaker that you can enjoy while sailing, camping, lounging, etc.</p>

<h3><strong>Ride Smart</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Find the cleanest routes for your daily commute and ride healthy.</strong></p>
<p>The most exciting innovation inside Noordung Boombox are the PM 2.5 and PM 10 particle sensors which keep track of air pollution. Boombox is catching real time data on air quality wherever you take your Noordung bike and it can show you the actual air quality on your phone through the Noordung app. You can use this information to find the cleanest routes and really enjoy the freshest air available while on the way. With crowdsourcing, we can use the data collected and get a more accurate map of air quality around the areas frequented by cyclists and pedestrians, thus increasing awareness about the need to take care of our environment.</p>

<h3><strong>Ride Ultralight</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Feel the magic of the lightest cruiser bicycle in the world.</strong></p>
<p>Noordung is definitely the lightest cruiser bike in the world as well as one of the lightest urban electric bicycles at this time. It's lightness stems from the fact that its robustly designed frame is built from the manually crafted finest carbon fibres. The expert craftsmen use carbon monocoque technology, which shows in a spotless carbon finish (so called carbon look). The entire cable management runs inside the frame which weighs only 2,300 g.</p>

<h3><strong>Ride Assisted</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Silent in-wheel e-motor with a 50 km range.</strong></p>
<p>The electric powered Noordung bikes (Noordung Voyager in Noordung Individual) use Keyde electric motor built into the CNC machined aluminium rear wheel, which was entirely developed by Noordung engineers. The electric motor with integrated electronics, is one of the lightest of its kind in the world. It is also extremely quiet, so that it doesn't interfere with your enjoyment of music. The batteries in the Boombox enable a range of over 50 km. In hybrid mode (a combination of assisted and unassisted pedalling), which is how we feel Noordung bikes should be used, it may increase to over 100 km.</p>

<h3><strong>Ride Electrified</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Charge your phone, tablet or computer via on board USB connector.</strong></p>
<p>Noordung Boombox is more than just a speaker and battery powering the electric motor and bike LED lights. It's also a proper power bank on two wheels! You can use its USB outlet to charge your smartphone, tablet, computer or any other electronic device. In its essence, Noordung Boombox is an ultimate standalone device that is your trusted power source whether you're camping, sailing or just enjoying the great outdoors.</p>

<p><strong>Herman Potocnik - Noordung </strong>(1892 - 1929) was a Slovenian rocket engineer, a pioneer of astronautics, space flight and technologies. In his only book “The Problem of Space Travel” he developed a specific concept of a space station which also inspired Stanley Kubrick when making the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. His book is one of the fundamental works on early space exploration.</p>

<p>His nickname, of which the origin is not completely clear, is supposedly a combination of two german words “No” and “Ordnung”(”No order”). We used it as an inspiration to create our bicycle. We wanted to explore cycling beyond traditional perceptions and practices. We tried to discover the very essence of cycling and have found it in one simple pleasure. <strong>The joy in journey.</strong></p>

<p>We thought of our past. The time when we were still children. We thought of our first encounter with a bicycle. Until that point in time, nothing was able to make us feel as free and independent as a bicycle. We remembered the smell of fresh grass, the forests, the vast fields that we were breathing in while exploring kilometers and kilometers of uncharted territories.</p>

<p>Noordung is based on the café racer culture and tradition. Our goal was to create a modern day version of the cult cruiser bike and upgrade it to a smart high tech machine. The result is this unique bike that reinvents the cycling experience and takes you on the ride of your life.</p>

He is the founder of one of the first digital agencies in Slovenia and recipient of multiple design awards. A happily married father of two sons let us inside his mind and shared his views on cycling, music, life, its pleasures and of course – Noordung.</strong></p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>How did it all begin? Where did you get the idea to create Noordung?</strong></p>
<p>At some point in my life, I rented a design studio that was at an ideal biking distance from my home. The only bike I had until then was a mountain bike, but never a city bike, hence I bought myself one. Just a plain ordinary city bike. Despite my general enthusiasm, something was bothering me. The bike I rode to work every day, was essentially a product based on a century old technology. I am a huge technology freak, so one day I told myself: »Let’s see what a modern city bike looks like.« So I started googling and ...</p>
<p><strong>...and you got thousands of hits?</strong></p>
<p>No, that’s the point. The more I researched, the more I started to realize that it’s impossible to find a bike that I would actually like. Simply put, I couldn’t find a bike that was both beautiful by design and high-tech. There were tons of high-tech recreational bikes, both road and mountain, but city bikes looked and felt mostly identical to the ones from one hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>And that pushed you into starting this company?</strong></p>
<p>Not immediately. At first, when I was still being reasonable, I only wanted to build a custom bike for myself. But as I was delving deeper and deeper into creating my »perfect bike«, I started to realize that the whole process is becoming way too complicated to be only treated as a »side project«, so 3 years ago, I decided to start a company and invested some of my own money in it. I quickly got a few friends on board, who started helping me developing (now) our product. I joke that I probably came up with the most convoluted excuse to persuade my wife that I need an expensive bike.</p>
<p><strong>Is Noordung an electric bike?</strong></p>
<p>Noordung is a family of four bike models. The first two models – <strong>Noordung Pure </strong>and <strong>Noordung Music</strong> – are classic, non-electric, bikes with spoked rims and seven gears. They are built around Noordung carbon frame which is ready for any potential upgrades in the future. Noordung is the lightest cruiser bike in the world, thus offering you swift and effortless movement around the urban jungles. <strong>Noordung Music</strong> is the entry point into our beautiful new world of combining music with cycling, as it comes with the Noordung Boombox, that plays music from your smartphone.</p>
<p>The top two models from the Noordung family are <strong>Noordung Voyager</strong> and <strong>Noordung Individual</strong>, which are electric bikes with a maximum speed of 25 km/h as per EU regulation. Electric bikes are definitely the next big thing in the biking industry, especially in the segment of city bikes where, in contrast to recreational bikes, sweating is an unwanted side effect of its use (riding to work, meetings, etc.)</p>
<p>What I find even more appealing is that Noordung is also – a traditional bike. In my opinion, the biggest drawback of urban electric bikes is their weight, which renders them practically useless once the battery runs out, or when the rider just wants to – ride. That’s why we at Noordung tried to build as light a bike as possible, therefore we chose to build the frame out of carbon fiber. By the way, Noordung is the only cruiser bike in the world with a carbon fiber frame! In this respect, we wanted to build an ideal hybrid bike, where human effort may or may not be joined by electric assistance. It depends. While riding to a meeting, electric assistance can help us arrive there sweat free. On the other hand, we may want to sweat out some of the stress while riding home from work, so we can afford to refrain from using electric assistance.</p>
<p>After numerous test kilometers, I realized that I only use electric assistance about half of the time. During the other half, I really like to feel my legs being more active. One of the core values of Noordung is to encourage its clients to lead and promote a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550574260/l5rlmqtlhxk92yuswguo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Electric drive seems to be ubiquitous in urban cycling, but music is definitely something new. How did music come into the picture?</strong></p>
<p>Music is without a doubt one of the most important things in my life. I love good music, it’s with me everywhere I go. Honestly, I came up with the idea while studying electric bikes and realized how all the manufacturers are treating the battery as an unwanted accessory. From a design perspective, that is. To me, the battery, as a source of energy, represented the heart of the bike, which deserved to be put on display. I found an ideal spot on top of the bike frame, where you can usually find a gasoline tank on motorcycles.</p>
<p>Once I made the battery the centerpiece of the frame, I started to wonder what other functionalities this tool could provide. I quickly came up with the idea of installing two speakers to which you can connect your smart phone and listen to music. Until then, I used headphones, which seriously limit your awareness around you and can be outright dangerous. That’s also the reason why many countries have banned them while biking. And that’s how our Boombox came to life.</p>
<p>Although some beg to differ, I feel that listening to music while riding is one of the best experiences ever! Music adds a whole new dimension to bike traveling and renders it even more beautiful. One of our test riders said it best after he came back from his test ride. With a big smile on his face, he said: »I felt like I was in a movie!«</p>
<p>Noordung bike and music are two components of one great idea, that’s why we called it: Superbicycle for music lovers.</p>
<p><strong>Although the Boombox is not your only association with music. You’ve recently formed your own music group, haven’t you?</strong></p>
<p>You are correct. Along with a torrent of creative individuals, a few outstanding, academically trained musicians joined our movement. As a music group, they will independently create original music. We have just recorded our first single titled »<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgwq-fUQgQ0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Traveling Light</a>« and made a wonderful video that pictures the joys of riding a bike and the beautiful nature of Slovenia – a country where we come from and which we love. Traveling Light is the first song from the coming album »Joy in Journey«. We are currently working on the second song which will be punchier and will take place in an urban setting.</p>
<p><strong>The female vocalist in the group is your wife, Eva Hren, who you say is the inspiration behind this whole project?</strong></p>
<p>Eva is an academically trained musician in jazz singing and classical guitar. She is one of the leading jazz and ethnic music performers in Slovenia. Life with her is an incredible journey and I am very grateful that she brought so much music to my life, home and family. Eva has a very broad taste in music and she has introduced me to its many different facets.</p>
<p>The most fascinating uniqueness of music is how it touches you emotionally; good music goes straight to the heart and, as we say, touches your soul. In this respect, it is similar to outstanding design that transcends the functional appeal of a product and opens up so many other levels. It can calm you down. It can encourage your curiosity. It can awake yearning, love, sadness, joy. It can break with the status quo and start a revolution!</p>
<p>Noordung band is an experiment where we want to introduce the creation of music to the process of creating a bike, connect the creative energies and broadcast our values to the general public, even through the means of music – from joy in journey to respecting our environment.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s go back to the bike. Music isn’t its only outstanding feature?</strong></p>
<p>Our most revolutionary innovation is that we added a particulate matter sensor into the Boombox, which measures the presence of harmful particles P2.5 and P10 in the air while the bike is in use. The sensor connects to a smartphone and shows the biker real time information on the air quality along his route. Hence it’s giving the biker the means and motivation to find the cleanest route possible.</p>
<p>I’m excited by the thought what our innovation might bring to urban areas by crowd-sourcing and mapping of this data. The official measuring stations in cities are fixed which means they can only provide accurate information for the micro location where they’re placed. Once we have these sensors on bikes, which are mobile and are usually ridden where pedestrians move, we can get a much more accurate and dispersed map of air quality on locations most frequented by people. In other words, with our solution we might actually get an accurate picture of how polluted urban centers and bike paths actually are. In addition, we’re also increasing the awareness of pollution levels and we encourage people to start thinking more green. Environmental responsibility is one of the core values of Noordung and we intend to build on it even further.</p>
<p><strong>Design also seems to be a special value at Noordung...</strong></p>
<p>When we created Noordung, we’ve set ourselves a goal to create “the most beautiful urban bike in the world”. It sounded like a pretentious goal, one that perfectly fits into the category of the usual overhyped startup promises. Nevertheless, I really do think that we came close. Based on the responses we’re getting from everyone who see it, there’s not a person that’s left cold after they set their eyes on Noordung. I am a strong fan of Scandinavian, minimalist design, where every line has its place, where functionality and beauty are seamlessly intertwined. Noordung’s design is obviously inspired by the café racer culture and classic cruiser bikes. However, I believe that we managed to pay tribute to this tradition while also infusing some contemporary and high-tech spirit into it.</p>
<p><strong>Aleksander Praper</strong>, an exceptional industrial designer, has been a part of this project from its very inception and is also one of the partners in the company. He created this breathtaking carbon frame, with its subliminal curves that is a work of art on its own. Alekdander compares these lines to a female body as a representation of organic perfection of proportions and curves.</p>
<p><strong>But your background is in digital production, how did you end up in industrial design?</strong></p>
<p>I love making digital products; It’s a game of interactions, storytelling at the content, design and technology levels. I have to admit that the whole ephemeral nature of digital products was causing me quite some frustration. Things change so fast that the technology and the user interface get replaced ever quicker, effectively making your product to history.</p>
<p>I come from a family of architects, A good building lasts 100 years or longer, outstanding architecture can remain relevant practically forever. I wanted to build something that will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be so bold at this point and say that the design of our bike will last forever but it does seem to me that it’s a worthwhile goal to strive to.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550574344/ogqb6thtzabxlupre5me.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Are there any essential differences between creating digital and physical products?</strong></p>
<p>Endless. Someone once told me that industrial design is great, the only thing that’s missing is the undo button. That’s probably the most obvious difference between a digital and a physical product. The iterations in the digital world are a lot less painful, both from a financial and time perspectives.</p>
<p>I learned this the hard way. At the same time, I feel that this so called “digital background” gave me a unique, fresh and less constrained view of the biking industry, which I sometimes find dull and unimaginative, especially in the field of urban bikes.</p>
<p><strong>Where does your study of philosophy fit in?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a branch of philosophy called ontology. Ontology is the philosophical study of being. Why something is rather than isn’t. It’s a deductive philosophical method, it explores the essence of things, events, phenomena. To me, this always seemed similar to design; to find that minimum that makes something something. In this respect, we at Noordung are looking for the essence of a bike, the essence of cycling. Which we find in joy in journey.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s go back to music, before we finish. You said that it’s an important part of your life. What are you listening to lately?</strong></p>
<p>It may be slightly atypical for my general taste in music, but I recently stumbled upon a jazz standard “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP02sgYrHsw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Every Time We Say Goodbye</a>” by Chet Baker. It’s a 7 minute masterpiece of a beautiful melancholic emotion that we feel when we’re saying our goodbyes. I’m fascinated how people used to be able to take their time for good melodies, which is practically impossible in this day and age.</p>
<p>But one of the most important lessons I learned while building the story of Noordung, is that for true pleasure, it’s always important and worth it to take your time. And that getting there will take its time too.</p>
</div></div>","Noordung - Joy in Journey
European and global metropolises from London and Berlin to San Francisco and Copenhagen are increasingly constructing a cycling culture and infrastructure. Trends show that, in the next few years, bicycles will overtake cars when it comes to mass means of transport. Although electric cars have gained media attention, the real electrical revolution in urban transport is happening in the bicycle industry. Here and now.
We created the Noordung company because we believe that the essence of urban transportation is not just about moving from one point to the other, but about enjoying the journey. Noordung is a company that solves the issues of urban cycling with a commitment to excellence of design, user experience and service design. We have created an innovative solution that connects cycling with music and sound.
Our main product is a luxury, smart urban superbicycle of the best quality featuring a multifunctional Boombox that creates an entirely new experience of urban cycling that has never been seen before.
Noordung superbicycle has been intensively developed for the past three years and, having set up an adequate environment, we will start a small-scale production in the beginning of Q2 2019.
 
Reinventing the ride

Ride Music
Up to 100 hours of music through the state-of-the-art speakers, played from your phone.
Noordung is a pioneer in joining music with cycling. The central part of Noordung Boombox are two 20 watt RMS speakers with a frequency range of 70 Hz – 20 kHz, which are tilted at a 45 degree angle toward the rider. Needless to say, they sound amazing! The speakers wirelessly connect to the riders smartphone and play all the music and sounds played on the smartphone. You can use the Boombox while riding as well as when it's detached from the bike, turning it into an excellent portable speaker that you can enjoy while sailing, camping, lounging, etc.
 

Ride Smart
Find the cleanest routes for your daily commute and ride healthy.
The most exciting innovation inside Noordung Boombox are the PM 2.5 and PM 10 particle sensors which keep track of air pollution. Boombox is catching real time data on air quality wherever you take your Noordung bike and it can show you the actual air quality on your phone through the Noordung app. You can use this information to find the cleanest routes and really enjoy the freshest air available while on the way. With crowdsourcing, we can use the data collected and get a more accurate map of air quality around the areas frequented by cyclists and pedestrians, thus increasing awareness about the need to take care of our environment.
 

Ride Ultralight
Feel the magic of the lightest cruiser bicycle in the world.
Noordung is definitely the lightest cruiser bike in the world as well as one of the lightest urban electric bicycles at this time. It's lightness stems from the fact that its robustly designed frame is built from the manually crafted finest carbon fibres. The expert craftsmen use carbon monocoque technology, which shows in a spotless carbon finish (so called carbon look). The entire cable management runs inside the frame which weighs only 2,300 g.
 

Ride Assisted
Silent in-wheel e-motor with a 50 km range.
The electric powered Noordung bikes (Noordung Voyager in Noordung Individual) use Keyde electric motor built into the CNC machined aluminium rear wheel, which was entirely developed by Noordung engineers. The electric motor with integrated electronics, is one of the lightest of its kind in the world. It is also extremely quiet, so that it doesn't interfere with your enjoyment of music. The batteries in the Boombox enable a range of over 50 km. In hybrid mode (a combination of assisted and unassisted pedalling), which is how we feel Noordung bikes should be used, it may increase to over 100 km.
 

Ride Electrified
Charge your phone, tablet or computer via on board USB connector.
Noordung Boombox is more than just a speaker and battery powering the electric motor and bike LED lights. It's also a proper power bank on two wheels! You can use its USB outlet to charge your smartphone, tablet, computer or any other electronic device. In its essence, Noordung Boombox is an ultimate standalone device that is your trusted power source whether you're camping, sailing or just enjoying the great outdoors.

Our Story

Herman Potocnik - Noordung (1892 - 1929) was a Slovenian rocket engineer, a pioneer of astronautics, space flight and technologies. In his only book “The Problem of Space Travel” he developed a specific concept of a space station which also inspired Stanley Kubrick when making the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. His book is one of the fundamental works on early space exploration.

His nickname, of which the origin is not completely clear, is supposedly a combination of two german words “No” and “Ordnung”(”No order”). We used it as an inspiration to create our bicycle. We wanted to explore cycling beyond traditional perceptions and practices. We tried to discover the very essence of cycling and have found it in one simple pleasure. The joy in journey.

We thought of our past. The time when we were still children. We thought of our first encounter with a bicycle. Until that point in time, nothing was able to make us feel as free and independent as a bicycle. We remembered the smell of fresh grass, the forests, the vast fields that we were breathing in while exploring kilometers and kilometers of uncharted territories.

Noordung is based on the café racer culture and tradition. Our goal was to create a modern day version of the cult cruiser bike and upgrade it to a smart high tech machine. The result is this unique bike that reinvents the cycling experience and takes you on the ride of your life.
 
Interview with Founder

 
""For true pleasure, it’s always important and worth it to take your time.""
 
Gregor Fras is a philosopher who has been immersed in design his entire life. For over twenty years, he creates digital stories in the roles of either a creative, architect or designer of user experiences and user interfaces for some of the most challenging digital products. He is the founder of one of the first digital agencies in Slovenia and recipient of multiple design awards. A happily married father of two sons let us inside his mind and shared his views on cycling, music, life, its pleasures and of course – Noordung.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did it all begin? Where did you get the idea to create Noordung?
At some point in my life, I rented a design studio that was at an ideal biking distance from my home. The only bike I had until then was a mountain bike, but never a city bike, hence I bought myself one. Just a plain ordinary city bike. Despite my general enthusiasm, something was bothering me. The bike I rode to work every day, was essentially a product based on a century old technology. I am a huge technology freak, so one day I told myself: »Let’s see what a modern city bike looks like.« So I started googling and ...
...and you got thousands of hits?
No, that’s the point. The more I researched, the more I started to realize that it’s impossible to find a bike that I would actually like. Simply put, I couldn’t find a bike that was both beautiful by design and high-tech. There were tons of high-tech recreational bikes, both road and mountain, but city bikes looked and felt mostly identical to the ones from one hundred years ago.
And that pushed you into starting this company?
Not immediately. At first, when I was still being reasonable, I only wanted to build a custom bike for myself. But as I was delving deeper and deeper into creating my »perfect bike«, I started to realize that the whole process is becoming way too complicated to be only treated as a »side project«, so 3 years ago, I decided to start a company and invested some of my own money in it. I quickly got a few friends on board, who started helping me developing (now) our product. I joke that I probably came up with the most convoluted excuse to persuade my wife that I need an expensive bike.
Is Noordung an electric bike?
Noordung is a family of four bike models. The first two models – Noordung Pure and Noordung Music – are classic, non-electric, bikes with spoked rims and seven gears. They are built around Noordung carbon frame which is ready for any potential upgrades in the future. Noordung is the lightest cruiser bike in the world, thus offering you swift and effortless movement around the urban jungles. Noordung Music is the entry point into our beautiful new world of combining music with cycling, as it comes with the Noordung Boombox, that plays music from your smartphone.
The top two models from the Noordung family are Noordung Voyager and Noordung Individual, which are electric bikes with a maximum speed of 25 km/h as per EU regulation. Electric bikes are definitely the next big thing in the biking industry, especially in the segment of city bikes where, in contrast to recreational bikes, sweating is an unwanted side effect of its use (riding to work, meetings, etc.)
What I find even more appealing is that Noordung is also – a traditional bike. In my opinion, the biggest drawback of urban electric bikes is their weight, which renders them practically useless once the battery runs out, or when the rider just wants to – ride. That’s why we at Noordung tried to build as light a bike as possible, therefore we chose to build the frame out of carbon fiber. By the way, Noordung is the only cruiser bike in the world with a carbon fiber frame! In this respect, we wanted to build an ideal hybrid bike, where human effort may or may not be joined by electric assistance. It depends. While riding to a meeting, electric assistance can help us arrive there sweat free. On the other hand, we may want to sweat out some of the stress while riding home from work, so we can afford to refrain from using electric assistance.
After numerous test kilometers, I realized that I only use electric assistance about half of the time. During the other half, I really like to feel my legs being more active. One of the core values of Noordung is to encourage its clients to lead and promote a healthy lifestyle.

Electric drive seems to be ubiquitous in urban cycling, but music is definitely something new. How did music come into the picture?
Music is without a doubt one of the most important things in my life. I love good music, it’s with me everywhere I go. Honestly, I came up with the idea while studying electric bikes and realized how all the manufacturers are treating the battery as an unwanted accessory. From a design perspective, that is. To me, the battery, as a source of energy, represented the heart of the bike, which deserved to be put on display. I found an ideal spot on top of the bike frame, where you can usually find a gasoline tank on motorcycles.
Once I made the battery the centerpiece of the frame, I started to wonder what other functionalities this tool could provide. I quickly came up with the idea of installing two speakers to which you can connect your smart phone and listen to music. Until then, I used headphones, which seriously limit your awareness around you and can be outright dangerous. That’s also the reason why many countries have banned them while biking. And that’s how our Boombox came to life.
Although some beg to differ, I feel that listening to music while riding is one of the best experiences ever! Music adds a whole new dimension to bike traveling and renders it even more beautiful. One of our test riders said it best after he came back from his test ride. With a big smile on his face, he said: »I felt like I was in a movie!«
Noordung bike and music are two components of one great idea, that’s why we called it: Superbicycle for music lovers.
Although the Boombox is not your only association with music. You’ve recently formed your own music group, haven’t you?
You are correct. Along with a torrent of creative individuals, a few outstanding, academically trained musicians joined our movement. As a music group, they will independently create original music. We have just recorded our first single titled »Traveling Light« and made a wonderful video that pictures the joys of riding a bike and the beautiful nature of Slovenia – a country where we come from and which we love. Traveling Light is the first song from the coming album »Joy in Journey«. We are currently working on the second song which will be punchier and will take place in an urban setting.
The female vocalist in the group is your wife, Eva Hren, who you say is the inspiration behind this whole project?
Eva is an academically trained musician in jazz singing and classical guitar. She is one of the leading jazz and ethnic music performers in Slovenia. Life with her is an incredible journey and I am very grateful that she brought so much music to my life, home and family. Eva has a very broad taste in music and she has introduced me to its many different facets.
The most fascinating uniqueness of music is how it touches you emotionally; good music goes straight to the heart and, as we say, touches your soul. In this respect, it is similar to outstanding design that transcends the functional appeal of a product and opens up so many other levels. It can calm you down. It can encourage your curiosity. It can awake yearning, love, sadness, joy. It can break with the status quo and start a revolution!

</p><p><b>THE WHAT</b></p>
<p>My name is John
Heiland. I am an Arizona native and undergraduate student at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. As many of you know, I am the proud owner of an iconic 1971
Volkswagen bus, known to some as ""Roxanne,"" ""Monkey Business,"" and
""The Frat-Wagon.""  This 43 year
old slice of Americana came into my life in 2012.  I worked two full-time summer jobs that year, and added my entire life savings and then some to call her mine.</p>
<p>Since then, this
fine piece of precision German engineering served faithfully as my trusty steed.
I give her more time, love, and care than I should admit to and is probably the
reason why things don't always work out with me and girlfriends. But at the end
of the day, good ol' Roxanne got me from point A to point B in style…not very
fast, but in style.</p>
<p>In our
cherished time together, Roxanne has taught me many life lessons. After living most of my young adult life according to the words of Ricky Bobby who once said ""I
wanna go fast,"" I learned that life in the slow lane isn't half bad. I
learned to appreciate the gas station conversations about buses in the good old
days with every washed up hippy west of the Mississippi. I also learned that one
simply cannot spell ""Volkswagen"" without ""swag."" If that doesn't
shatter your entire universe, I don't know what will.</p>
<p><b>THE WHY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Just a few
weeks ago, I was bumpin' some tunes and burnin' some rubber on the 405
northbound in the always beautiful OC when Roxie’s engine seized up, leaving me
heartbroken and stranded on the side of one of California's busiest freeways.  Roxie was towed back to Loyola Marymount
where she sat a few weeks while I was in utter despair. The experience was
traumatic, and left me wondering if I would ever be able to feel joy again in
this cold, cruel world.</p>
<p>Once the tears stopped and my $2,000 tax return was in my bank account, I
had her towed to the trusted German Motor Works in Garden Grove, thinking I would have enough for the repair.  The autopsy revealed that Roxie’s oil pump
had malfunctioned and stopped pumping this lubricated life-blood through the 4
cylinders of my bulletproof air-cooled motor.  The results were not pretty.  The engine had burnt to a crisp and was not
salvageable in any way.  My worst nightmare had come true.</p>
<p><b>THE HOW MUCH</b></p>
<p>Greg, a master
mechanic who hails from Deutschland (and who actually rebuilt this engine 15
years ago for the previous owner) delivered the bad news that it
will cost a whopping <b>$4,520.40 </b>for a complete new motor build from the
ground up (see invoice attached in image gallery). </p>
<p>I have been
assured Roxie is worth every penny from an investment perspective, but as a starving college student this type of money
ain't exactly chump change. My tax return is probably money I should
be saving for life after college when I can't find a job and need to subsist
off of ramen noodles. However, I don't know how much longer I can stand to see
Roxanne sit in a garage in pieces before I have the doctor pull the plug on her
for good, so I intend to put this and everything else I can back into the bus.</p>
<p>In the next 2
weeks, with your help, I am hoping to raise <b>$2,500</b> in order to supplement my funds and resurrect Roxie from the grave.  I know that money is tight and there are
probably more gallant, world changing causes that you could donate to.  But if you've ever enjoyed a ride in my bus,
ever want to enjoy a ride in my bus in the future, or simply want to continue
to see the road graced by such an aesthetically pleasing piece of machinery, I will be
forever indebted to whatever you can spare to help me get Roxanne back on the
road and turning heads once again. I know crowd-funding for an old VW bus is a little crazy, but crazy is all I've got at this point.</p>
<p>Anything and
everything helps!  <b>Please check out my ""perks"" of giving section to see how you
will be rewarded.</b>  In all
seriousness, thank you for your generosity from the bottom of my heart (and
Roxie’s too!).</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

off of ramen noodles. However, I don't know how much longer I can stand to see
Roxanne sit in a garage in pieces before I have the doctor pull the plug on her
for good, so I intend to put this and everything else I can back into the bus.
In the next 2
weeks, with your help, I am hoping to raise $2,500 in order to supplement my funds and resurrect Roxie from the grave.  I know that money is tight and there are
probably more gallant, world changing causes that you could donate to.  But if you've ever enjoyed a ride in my bus,
ever want to enjoy a ride in my bus in the future, or simply want to continue
to see the road graced by such an aesthetically pleasing piece of machinery, I will be
forever indebted to whatever you can spare to help me get Roxanne back on the
road and turning heads once again. I know crowd-funding for an old VW bus is a little crazy, but crazy is all I've got at this point.
Anything and
everything helps!  Please check out my ""perks"" of giving section to see how you
will be rewarded.  In all
seriousness, thank you for your generosity from the bottom of my heart (and
Roxie’s too!).
Sincerely,

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">My Birthday Bike Wish</span></p>
</div>
<p>I have a dear friend -who loves being active - Running, hiking, yoga, tennis. It’s her outlet, her way to de-stress, her place of zen.  Earlier this year my friend was diagnosed with type 2-diabetes last year due to genetic pre-disposition.   In Type-2 Diabetics life expectancy is shortened by 15 years (according to the National Institute of Health).  Exercise can keep the ticking clock at bay, significantly.  So, for my dear friend, staying active is not just a matter of joy, it is a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Sadly, last month my friend hurt her knee - in a way that she she will no longer do a lot of the active things that she loves. But... she can bike.</p>
<p>My friend is shy about her condition, and she doesn't want too many people to know about it.   That's why you won't see any pictures, videos, or even her name up here. Also I want this to be a surprise, so I am keeping her identity anonymous. I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>I'd like my dear friend to be on this planet for as many years as possible.  For my birthday wish - I'd like to buy her a bike.</p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need </span></p>
<div>
<p>I've set the fundraising goal to $3000 to buy my friend a good quality bike that she can travel long distances on, which she can race if she gets into it (which she probably will as she's super-competitive), and which will last her for years.  The more miles/years she can bike the healthier she can be.  The top recommended bikes (according to the internets) run at least $3000, so I've set the goal here.  Hopefully this is a realistic goal that we can meet.   </p>
<p>The bike that I buy will depend on the amount of money raised. If we reach our goal, then the plan is to purchase and present my friend with a carbon/racing style bike and a helmet (again, to keep her on the planet longer).  Any and all money that is raised that exceeds the purchase price of the bike will be donated to a non-profit that helps urban youth build/own bikes.   </p>

<p>This is a story of joy, sadness, and with your help, redemption!</p>
<h3>The Joy:</h3>
<p>As some of you know I am officially a bike commuter.  I have been riding my bike to and from work daily for some time now.  I do share a car with my lovely girlfriend Sam, but we work in different locations, do things on different schedules, so two modes of transportation only seems right. So for Christmas this year Sam surprised me with a bike and I haven't gotten off since.  Riding my bike keeps me healthy, happy, and where I need to be.  I couldn't explain the feeling I have when riding my bike, but its somewhere between the greatest feeling you could ever have and some feeling slightly greater than that.</p>
<h3>The Sadness:</h3>
<p>Sadly last night someone stole that joy.  Yes my bicycle was stolen right off of my friends porch while we were inside.  Tragedy. When I walked outside to hop on my bike and I saw it was not where I placed it my heart sank. I felt angry that this would happen, I felt sad that my joy had been taken from me like it was just a toy.  I also felt terrible because I know this bike not only brought me joy, but I could tell how happy it made Sam that she got me a Christmas gift that I literaly use every single day. She was as proud of that bike as I was. I know first question, yes it was locked. Second question, yes I have attempted to file a police report, but APD has there hands tied up with people shooting and whatnot.  So...</p>
<h3>The Redemption:</h3>
<p>I have started this campaign to help raise funds for a new bike! I'm sure everyone can understand unexpected nature of crime and I hope you can both empathize and support me in this! I will be using the funds to purchase a new bike (Not sure if you all have tried buying a bicycle lately, but a quality bike that gets daily use sure ain't cheap) as well as top notch securtiy for the bike.  I have a few bike models in mind, as well as new chains/u-locks, but if you all have any sugguestions to pair with your donations I will surely take heed.</p>

<p style=""line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px;"">Vi stiller som “Team Vikings on Clogs” (Viking med tresko for de om ikke skulle skjønne den). Det vi skal gjøre er å krysse India på tvers fra Jaisalmer i vest til Shillong i øst i en Rickshaw (tuk-tuk) ila 14 dager. Og ja. Vi skal kjøre selv! Strekningen er ikke mindre enn ca 2800km (se kart over) og tilsvarer en strekning fra Oslo til Barcelona. Det er ingen fast rute, ingen reserveplan og ingen som helst garanti for at vi vil klare å fullføre. Vi har start og målpunkt og så er det opp til oss å finne beste/verste rute. Det eneste som er sikkert er at vi kommer til å kjøre oss bort, kjøre oss fast og at vi vil få problem med Rickshawen under veis. Det er det som er selve utfordringen! <a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com/the-jibber/2015/2/13/wtf-is-the-rickshaw-run-video"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rickshaw run</a></p>

<h4>Vår geniale Rickshaw!</h4>Hvis Gud hadde skapt verdens maskiner, så hadde han mest sannsynlig droppet å lage en Rickshaw.<p>Det er i utgangspunktet ingen god ide. Den er langt i fra rask, den lukter, bråker og tipper når du svinger litt for brått. Den slår seg oftere vrang enn en EMO i tenårene og etter en dag bak spakene, så kjennes det som en elefant har sparket deg i rævva. Men så er det et eller annet som er tiltrekkende med disse doningene og derfor har vi tatt utfordringen. Og med en teknisk spesifikasjon som dette, så er det vanskelig å si nei til denne turen:</p>
<p>Motor: en sylinder, totaker, luftavkjølt</p>
<p>Effekt: 7hk på 5000 rpm (tilsvarer en familiehund)</p>
<p>Overføring: 4 gir frem og 1 revers</p>
<p>Kapasitet: 8 liters tank + 1,4 reserve</p>
<p>Topphastighet: 55 km/t (Nedover, med sola i ryggen og kjøttkaker til middag)</p>

<p style=""line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px;"">
Men turen handler om mer enn bare å ha det ""moro"". Vi skal også samle inn penger til en Indisk veldedighetsorganisasjon som heter Duniya og her kommer du inn i bildet!</p>
<p style=""line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px;"">Duniya
Foundation ble etablert i 1996 for å gi innbyggerne i slummen Nagwa i den
nordindiske byen Varanasi skolegang og basis helseartikler. Organisasjonen
hjelper bl.a barn med skolegang, mat og aktiviteter. </p>
<p>I avdelingen Duniya Banks
Utdanning er det lærere som daglig underviser ca. åtti nysgjerrige barn, som i
tillegg får et måltid til lunsj av Duniya
Nutrition. Dette er ofte det eneste varme måltid de spiser i løpet av dagen. For 1000kr i året er et barn sikret skolegang, skoleuniform, mat og hygieneartikler som tannbørster utdelt månedlig.</p>
<p>Når barna blir større, så blir
de overført til Duniya Generation og til videregående opplæring. Kostnaden for utdanning
er også finansiert av Duniya stiftelsen. </p>
<p>De har også et håndarbeidsverksted hvor de lager tepper og andre håndlagde produkter. Disse selges gjennom Duniyas
egen nettbutikk. Kvinner som jobber i Nagwa er sikret en beskjeden, men nødvendig
inntekt. Duniya Foundation mottar ingen subsidier og er kun basert på private
donasjoner.</p>
<p>De har et samarbeid og administrasjon i Nederland. Administrasjon er baser fullt og helt på frivillighet! Nettsiden inneholder ikke alt for mye informasjon på engelsk, men er verdt
et besøk. <a href=""http://www.duniya.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.duniya.org/</a></p>
<p>Vi har allerede vært i kontakt med Duniya og kommer også til å besøke
de på vår ferd igjennom India. Til dere som er med å bidra, så har Duniya lovet  å gi en liten gave i retur til dere som kjøper en ""perk"". Disse tar vi med hjem i ryggsekken og distribuerer når vi er tilbake. Vårt mål er å samle inn 1250 euro!   (Dvs skolegang til ca 12 barn i ett år!). Mer info om gavene finner du under ""perks"" knappen. </p>
<p>Donasjoner:</p>
<p>NB! velger du å kjøpe en ""perk"", så vil du motta en gave tilbake, men det er også mulig å donere egendefinert beløp.</p>
<p>Du må velge betalingsmåte PayPal, men når du åpner linken, så kan du velge å benytte kredittkort! </p>
<p>Har du problem med å finne ut av betalingen, så kontakt meg på facebook eller send meg en mail på retterasen@gmail.com</p>

<p><b>Rickshaw
Run 2015</b></p>
<p><span>
In April we will be driving through India in a glorified lawnmower, also known as
a rickshaw. The journey is about 2700km from west to east India in about 2
weeks. We will be driving ourselves and our backpacks will go on the roof. No
set route, no back-up, no way of knowing if we are going to make it. The only
certainty is that we will get lost we will get stuck and we will break down....it’ll
be an adventure!<br/>
<br/>
While we’re on our adventure, we would like to contribute to the Indian community.
We would like to take this opportunity to help make the life for some of them a
bit better. That is why we are raising money for Duniya Foundation. 

</span></p>
<p><b><span>
But first of all: who are “we”?</span></b></p>
<p><span>
We are two Dutch girls and one tough viking from Norway. We all love to travel and
therefore it will be no surprise that’s the way we met. Together we decided to
participate in this Indian-adventure and that is how team ‘Vikings on clogs’
was born.</span></p>
<p><b><br/>
The rickshaw and the run</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><span>If God had made machines he
probably wouldn’t have bothered with a Rickshaw. Essentially, it’s not a very
good idea. It’s not very fast, it smells, it falls over when you go round
corners, it breaks down more often than an emo teenager and a days driving feels
like you’ve been kicked up the arse by an elephant. But
somehow all this makes them better. </span></p>
<p>Here are some specs:<br/>
<b>Engine</b>: 2 stroke, single cylinder, forced air cooled <br/>
<b>Power</b>: 7 HP at 5000 rpm (equiv. 1 family dog)<br/>
<b>Transmission</b>: 4 forward 1 reverse<br/>
<b>Fuel Capacity</b>: 8 ltr + 1.4 reserve<br/>
<b>TopSpeed</b>: 55km/u (downhill)<br/>
<b>Engine size</b>: 145.45 cc<br/>
<b>System Voltage</b>: 12V , DC<br/>
<br/>
The Rickshaw Run has a set starting point and finish line. The starting point
will be in Jaisalmer which is in the west of India and the finish line is in
Shillong in the east. Of course we will make some detours along the way…How far
is it really? It’s the same distance as driving from Oslo to Barcelona! (Scroll a bit up for maps/pics/route)</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Duniya
Foundation</b></p>
<p>Duniya Foundaton was
established in 1996 to help the residents of Nagwa slum in the northern Indian
city of Varanasi to have access to health and education.<br/>
<br/>
Duniya’s teachers educate more than 80 studious children, the children are
provided a warm meal during lunch break by the chef of Duniya Nutrition. This
is often the only warm meal they will eat in a day.<br/>
<br/>
The first generation of school kids started to go to high school. The costs for
this external education are also covered by Duniya through Duniya Generation.
In the artstore of Duniya Decoration handmade items are produced by local
woman. These woman from Nagwa earn a modest but regular income  by selling this artwork through Duniya’s
webshop. <br/>
<br/>
Duniya Foundation is a small organization which is entirely dependent on
private donations. During our rickshaw run through India we will visit Duniya
in Varanasi to meet the kids, teachers, staff and experience how it’s run on a daily basis.  This is also where we’re going to pick up the perks, bring it home and send it to you!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>What can you do to
help?</span></b></p>
<p>We
set ourselves the goal to raise at least €1250,- for Duniya Foundation. We
would really appreciate if you could contribute to that. You can make a
donation by pressing the button ‘Contribute now’. Do you like to get something
nice in return, besides good karma? That is possible! Pick a nice perk, you’ll
find the options on the right side of this page. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Of course you can also help us out by sharing this page &amp; don’t forget to
follow us on our adventure!</span><br/></p>
<p><b><span>How
does the payment system works?</span></b></p>

You can donate through this website via Paypal or via
creditcard. You’ll find both possibilities if you click the button ‘Contribute
now’. We prefer to receive the donations this way, because we can keep the
score and keep track of your donation. <br/>
<br/>
But, if you don’t have a PayPal account or if you receive an error when paying
by credit card you can try a third method: send us an e-mail on <a href=""mailto:linekekoomen@hotmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">linekekoomen@hotmail.com</a> or <a href=""mailto:retterasen@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">retterasen@gmail.com</a>. Let us know what
the amount is that you would like to donate, if you would like to receive a
perk then send us your postal address. We will make sure your money gets into
the right hands.

De vrouwen van Nagwa die er werken weten zich verzekerd van een bescheiden maar regelmatig inkomen. 


Stichting Duniya is een kleinschalige organisatie ontvangt geen subsidies, maar draait volledig op particuliere donaties. Wij brengen tijdens onze reis door India een bezoek aan Duniya in Varanasi (ongeveer halverwege onze trip)!




Hoe kun jij helpen?
Ons doel is om minimaal €1250,- op te halen voor Stichting Duniya. We zouden het daarom te gek vinden als je een bijdrage wilt leveren. Dat kan je doen door rechts op de knop 'Contribute now' te klikken. Je bepaalt dan zelf het bedrag dat jij kunt missen.Vind je het leuk om er, naast goede karma, ook nog iets tastbaars voor terug te krijgen? Dat kan! Kijk dan even aan de rechterkant van deze pagina naar de 'perks' (een souvenir voor jou). Natuurlijk help je ons ook heel erg als je deze pagina deelt & vergeet niet om ons avontuur door India te volgen! Hoe werkt het met betalen?Je kunt via deze website met Paypal of direct met creditcard betalen. Je vindt beide mogelijkheden achter de knop 'Contribute now'. Betalen via de website heeft natuurlijk onze voorkeur, want zo tikt de teller direct door en kunnen we jouw donatie goed bijhouden. Maar mocht het je nou niet lukken via deze weg, stuur dan een e-mail naar linekekoomen@hotmail.com. Vermeld hierin het bedrag dat je wilt doneren, eventueel je 'perk' naar keuze en in dit laatste geval ook je post adres. Wij zorgen dat jouw donatie op de juiste plek komt.






Norsk: Rickshaw Run og Veldedighet


Galskapen:
I april 2015 skal vi (Svein-Ole, Monique and Lineke) stille med lag i The Rickshaw Run I India. Dette er altså en sammensetning av en nordmann og to nederlandske damer!
Vi stiller som “Team Vikings on Clogs” (Viking med tresko for de om ikke skulle skjønne den). Det vi skal gjøre er å krysse India på tvers fra Jaisalmer i vest til Shillong i øst i en Rickshaw (tuk-tuk) ila 14 dager. Og ja. Vi skal kjøre selv! Strekningen er ikke mindre enn ca 2800km (se kart over) og tilsvarer en strekning fra Oslo til Barcelona. Det er ingen fast rute, ingen reserveplan og ingen som helst garanti for at vi vil klare å fullføre. Vi har start og målpunkt og så er det opp til oss å finne beste/verste rute. Det eneste som er sikkert er at vi kommer til å kjøre oss bort, kjøre oss fast og at vi vil få problem med Rickshawen under veis. Det er det som er selve utfordringen! Rickshaw run

Vår geniale Rickshaw!Hvis Gud hadde skapt verdens maskiner, så hadde han mest sannsynlig droppet å lage en Rickshaw.Det er i utgangspunktet ingen god ide. Den er langt i fra rask, den lukter, bråker og tipper når du svinger litt for brått. Den slår seg oftere vrang enn en EMO i tenårene og etter en dag bak spakene, så kjennes det som en elefant har sparket deg i rævva. Men så er det et eller annet som er tiltrekkende med disse doningene og derfor har vi tatt utfordringen. Og med en teknisk spesifikasjon som dette, så er det vanskelig å si nei til denne turen:
Motor: en sylinder, totaker, luftavkjølt
Effekt: 7hk på 5000 rpm (tilsvarer en familiehund)
Overføring: 4 gir frem og 1 revers
Kapasitet: 8 liters tank + 1,4 reserve
Topphastighet: 55 km/t (Nedover, med sola i ryggen og kjøttkaker til middag)
Motor: 145 CCM
Duniya - Veldedighet i slummen

Men turen handler om mer enn bare å ha det ""moro"". Vi skal også samle inn penger til en Indisk veldedighetsorganisasjon som heter Duniya og her kommer du inn i bildet!
Duniya
Foundation ble etablert i 1996 for å gi innbyggerne i slummen Nagwa i den
nordindiske byen Varanasi skolegang og basis helseartikler. Organisasjonen
hjelper bl.a barn med skolegang, mat og aktiviteter. 
I avdelingen Duniya Banks
Utdanning er det lærere som daglig underviser ca. åtti nysgjerrige barn, som i
tillegg får et måltid til lunsj av Duniya
Nutrition. Dette er ofte det eneste varme måltid de spiser i løpet av dagen. For 1000kr i året er et barn sikret skolegang, skoleuniform, mat og hygieneartikler som tannbørster utdelt månedlig.
Når barna blir større, så blir
de overført til Duniya Generation og til videregående opplæring. Kostnaden for utdanning
er også finansiert av Duniya stiftelsen. 
De har også et håndarbeidsverksted hvor de lager tepper og andre håndlagde produkter. Disse selges gjennom Duniyas
egen nettbutikk. Kvinner som jobber i Nagwa er sikret en beskjeden, men nødvendig
inntekt. Duniya Foundation mottar ingen subsidier og er kun basert på private
donasjoner.
De har et samarbeid og administrasjon i Nederland. Administrasjon er baser fullt og helt på frivillighet! Nettsiden inneholder ikke alt for mye informasjon på engelsk, men er verdt
et besøk. http://www.duniya.org/
Vi har allerede vært i kontakt med Duniya og kommer også til å besøke
de på vår ferd igjennom India. Til dere som er med å bidra, så har Duniya lovet  å gi en liten gave i retur til dere som kjøper en ""perk"". Disse tar vi med hjem i ryggsekken og distribuerer når vi er tilbake. Vårt mål er å samle inn 1250 euro!   (Dvs skolegang til ca 12 barn i ett år!). Mer info om gavene finner du under ""perks"" knappen. 
Donasjoner:
NB! velger du å kjøpe en ""perk"", så vil du motta en gave tilbake, men det er også mulig å donere egendefinert beløp.
Du må velge betalingsmåte PayPal, men når du åpner linken, så kan du velge å benytte kredittkort! 
Har du problem med å finne ut av betalingen, så kontakt meg på facebook eller send meg en mail på retterasen@gmail.com
På forhånd takk for hjelpen!




English section:
Rickshaw
Run 2015

In April we will be driving through India in a glorified lawnmower, also known as
a rickshaw. The journey is about 2700km from west to east India in about 2
weeks. We will be driving ourselves and our backpacks will go on the roof. No
set route, no back-up, no way of knowing if we are going to make it. The only
certainty is that we will get lost we will get stuck and we will break down....it’ll
be an adventure!

While we’re on our adventure, we would like to contribute to the Indian community.
We would like to take this opportunity to help make the life for some of them a
bit better. That is why we are raising money for Duniya Foundation. 



But first of all: who are “we”?

We are two Dutch girls and one tough viking from Norway. We all love to travel and
therefore it will be no surprise that’s the way we met. Together we decided to
participate in this Indian-adventure and that is how team ‘Vikings on clogs’
was born.

The rickshaw and the run

If God had made machines he
probably wouldn’t have bothered with a Rickshaw. Essentially, it’s not a very
good idea. It’s not very fast, it smells, it falls over when you go round
corners, it breaks down more often than an emo teenager and a days driving feels
like you’ve been kicked up the arse by an elephant. But
somehow all this makes them better. 
Here are some specs:
Engine: 2 stroke, single cylinder, forced air cooled 
Power: 7 HP at 5000 rpm (equiv. 1 family dog)
Transmission: 4 forward 1 reverse
Fuel Capacity: 8 ltr + 1.4 reserve
TopSpeed: 55km/u (downhill)
Engine size: 145.45 cc
System Voltage: 12V , DC

The Rickshaw Run has a set starting point and finish line. The starting point
will be in Jaisalmer which is in the west of India and the finish line is in
Shillong in the east. Of course we will make some detours along the way…How far
is it really? It’s the same distance as driving from Oslo to Barcelona! (Scroll a bit up for maps/pics/route)

Duniya
Foundation
Duniya Foundaton was
established in 1996 to help the residents of Nagwa slum in the northern Indian
city of Varanasi to have access to health and education.

Duniya’s teachers educate more than 80 studious children, the children are
provided a warm meal during lunch break by the chef of Duniya Nutrition. This
is often the only warm meal they will eat in a day.

The first generation of school kids started to go to high school. The costs for
this external education are also covered by Duniya through Duniya Generation.
In the artstore of Duniya Decoration handmade items are produced by local
woman. These woman from Nagwa earn a modest but regular income  by selling this artwork through Duniya’s
webshop. 

Duniya Foundation is a small organization which is entirely dependent on
private donations. During our rickshaw run through India we will visit Duniya
in Varanasi to meet the kids, teachers, staff and experience how it’s run on a daily basis.  This is also where we’re going to pick up the perks, bring it home and send it to you!


What can you do to
help?
We
set ourselves the goal to raise at least €1250,- for Duniya Foundation. We
would really appreciate if you could contribute to that. You can make a
donation by pressing the button ‘Contribute now’. Do you like to get something
nice in return, besides good karma? That is possible! Pick a nice perk, you’ll
find the options on the right side of this page. 

Of course you can also help us out by sharing this page & don’t forget to
follow us on our adventure!
How
does the payment system works?

You can donate through this website via Paypal or via
creditcard. You’ll find both possibilities if you click the button ‘Contribute
now’. We prefer to receive the donations this way, because we can keep the
score and keep track of your donation. 

But, if you don’t have a PayPal account or if you receive an error when paying
by credit card you can try a third method: send us an e-mail on linekekoomen@hotmail.com or retterasen@gmail.com. Let us know what
the amount is that you would like to donate, if you would like to receive a
perk then send us your postal address. We will make sure your money gets into
the right hands.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Sunshade360 will block all the sunlight before its heat and harmful UV even reach your car. At the same time, it also provides a layer of heat isolation air between the shades and vehicle body. The air is constantly moving, so the vehicle's passenger compartment will never feel or see the sunlight. <strong>The maximum inside temperature it could possibly reach is the surrounding air tempture.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Sunshade360 provides maximum privacy</strong></h2>
<p>Since all the windows are covered from all directions, you have created your own personal space with total privacy. It also protects your valuables from any prying eyes. Imaging this, you can take a nap, change clothes at the beach, read a book, or watch video without the eyes-blinding sunlight or peoples curious peek. </p>

<h2><strong>Sunshade360 is practical </strong></h2>
<p>Sunshade360 has a very small footprint and it is very thin with an aerodynamic low profile. When it is in full extended position, Sunshade360 is even narrower than your vehicle's side mirror. One of the biggest difference of this design from others is the shades will turn to fit the car's exterior, so the risk of car damaging will be dramatically reduced when the wind storms suddenly hit.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Q: How is the Sunshade360 mounted to the top of the vehicle?</strong></h3>
<p>A: Now majority of the minivan and SUV comes with factory installed roof rack and Sunshade360 will be counted very securely to the roof rack.  If your vehicle is not equipped with a roof rack, the installation package will include one.</p>
<h3><strong>Q: Can someone steal the Sunshade360 when the vehicle is parked unattended?</strong></h3>
<p>A: The risk is very low, there will be a locking mechanism with keys that secures the Sunshade360 to the roof rack.  </p>
<h3><strong>Q: How to prevent the shade is deployed during driving?</strong></h3>
<p>A: It will lock the Sunshade360 at the retracted position when it detects that vehicle is moving or the outside winds are too strong.</p>
<h3><strong>Q: How to retract the shades when the driving mechanis does not work?</strong></h3>
<p>A: It will come with a mannual procesure to roll the shades in when the automated system is failed. </p>

</h2>
<h3>SYSTEM INTEGRATION</h3>
<p>The sunshade360 system is a highly integrated system that need to endure the harsh environment and whatever the mother nature is throwing at it. We believe all the building blocks and engineering principles are already developed so the main risk is the integration. To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience and quality/reliability that it needs, we will design the sunshade360 system with Design For Manufacturing principle, take advantage the mass source of off shelf modules, and test system with an obsession for perfection.</p>
<h3>LOGISTICS &amp; SUPPLY CHAIN</h3>
<p>Many Indiegogo campaigns can encounter problems when taking their lab prototypes to mass production, for example, how to manage different form factors for different cars. To tackle this, we think execution and project timeline management are the keys and are essential for this project. We take this issue seriously with plans in place. Now we mainly require the resources to execute them.</p>
<h3>TEAM</h3>
<p>Right people is one of the most critical part of the project. We want to build a talented, passionate, motivated designers and engineers team. If you are interested, please drop us a note.</p></div>","The inside temperature of an enclosed vehicle under the sun can reach a fatal level as quickly as 10 mins.

If this compaign is successful, Sunshade360 will start delivery before June'2014.
 
Sunshade360 provides 360 degrees coverage
All the shades and the extendable/retractable arms are stored inside a thin aerodynamic box, which is mounted on the top of the vehicle (to your car's roof rack). When retracted, Sunshade360 has minimal or no impact to the driving visibility and the fuel economy, with a very neat and clean design.   
Sunshade360 in retracted state
 
When extended, the shades cover all the windows from all 360 degrees, no matter how and where you park your vehicle.

Works on other types of vehicle too
 
Sunshade360 will block all the sunlight before its heat and harmful UV even reach your car. At the same time, it also provides a layer of heat isolation air between the shades and vehicle body. The air is constantly moving, so the vehicle's passenger compartment will never feel or see the sunlight. The maximum inside temperature it could possibly reach is the surrounding air tempture.

 Maximum protection from the sunshine and heat
 
Sunshade360 provides maximum privacy
Since all the windows are covered from all directions, you have created your own personal space with total privacy. It also protects your valuables from any prying eyes. Imaging this, you can take a nap, change clothes at the beach, read a book, or watch video without the eyes-blinding sunlight or peoples curious peek.

 Sunshade360 in closed state, no light or prying eyes can penetrate the shades
 
 
Sunshade360 is practical 
Sunshade360 has a very small footprint and it is very thin with an aerodynamic low profile. When it is in full extended position, Sunshade360 is even narrower than your vehicle's side mirror. One of the biggest difference of this design from others is the shades will turn to fit the car's exterior, so the risk of car damaging will be dramatically reduced when the wind storms suddenly hit.

Sunshade360 is convenient
Sunshade360 is powered with solar panels, and comes with a slim wireless remote control. It is opened and closed with a click of a button. No tangling wires, no manual handling. When you reach your vehicle, it will be ready and cool, just for you.

A car key control is all your need to carry or operate.
 
Sunshade360 is flexible
Sunshade360's shades are individually operated. You could open all shades or just one. Therefore you can keep cool when you are enjoying the view, or waiting for kids inside the car, or even when you are totally stuck on highway traffic. 

 Leave front shade open
 

 Leave one side-shade open
 
Sunshade360 comes with style
Certainly we do not want a big, bulky, black box on the top of the vehicle. We definitely can throw some styles into the design to make it a little bit fashionable.

Perk recommendation
Since it is not realistic to have an one-size-fit-all Sunshade360, the following listed vehicles will be covered first.
 
 
FAQs
Q: How is the Sunshade360 mounted to the top of the vehicle?
A: Now majority of the minivan and SUV comes with factory installed roof rack and Sunshade360 will be counted very securely to the roof rack.  If your vehicle is not equipped with a roof rack, the installation package will include one.
Q: Can someone steal the Sunshade360 when the vehicle is parked unattended?
A: The risk is very low, there will be a locking mechanism with keys that secures the Sunshade360 to the roof rack.  
Q: How to prevent the shade is deployed during driving?
A: It will lock the Sunshade360 at the retracted position when it detects that vehicle is moving or the outside winds are too strong.
Q: How to retract the shades when the driving mechanis does not work?
A: It will come with a mannual procesure to roll the shades in when the automated system is failed. 
 

Risks and challenges

SYSTEM INTEGRATION
The sunshade360 system is a highly integrated system that need to endure the harsh environment and whatever the mother nature is throwing at it. We believe all the building blocks and engineering principles are already developed so the main risk is the integration. To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience and quality/reliability that it needs, we will design the sunshade360 system with Design For Manufacturing principle, take advantage the mass source of off shelf modules, and test system with an obsession for perfection.
LOGISTICS & SUPPLY CHAIN
Many Indiegogo campaigns can encounter problems when taking their lab prototypes to mass production, for example, how to manage different form factors for different cars. To tackle this, we think execution and project timeline management are the keys and are essential for this project. We take this issue seriously with plans in place. Now we mainly require the resources to execute them.
TEAM
Right people is one of the most critical part of the project. We want to build a talented, passionate, motivated designers and engineers team. If you are interested, please drop us a note.",17.0,0,"2 Campaigns

prototype was based on bare test-board. We tested different pressure sensors

started to develop microprocessor software. Development later considered
critical tasks of noise reduction continued by improvement of power-management. Since SkyBean is very light and
small, we had to figure out the way how to power it. Now a small battery

The campaign is over but our work continues. Visit our new website!            We are group of young engineers who are keen on
paragliding. As active members of paragliding community we got familiar with beauties and pleasures but also many needs and expenses of this breath-taking hobby. We created
the most affordable and beautiful vario in the world – this is
how we want to help every pilot out there in the skies. With high-quality, robustness and reliability
it still won’t burn a hole in pilot`s pocket.SkyBean real flight test -  sink/lift alarm. 
handy, lightweight and wallet-friendly
high precision digital barometer with 10 cm resolution
long life - 150 hours on a single button cell battery (CR2032)
configurable audio volume
configurable sink/lift alarm threshold
battery included, actually two of them
       

Set your lift and sink alarm threshold on the device. Would you like to set your own audio profile used in low cost
varios? Create, modify and finally vote for the best audio profile
for the basic model. More advanced pilots can create their own audio profile.


Our first
prototype was based on bare test-board. We tested different pressure sensors
and used them with prototype platform to prove the concept. From this point we
started to develop microprocessor software. Development later considered
critical tasks of noise reduction continued by improvement of power-management. Since SkyBean is very light and
small, we had to figure out the way how to power it. Now a small battery
provides enough juice for over 150 hours of flying. Design - we knew how important is the design. Even more important was to build a useful device with hard case and small enough to fit in pocket or helmet.Right
now the latest prototypes are tested in the air. Our test-pilots check the functionality, reliability and improve the audio profiles to fit everybody. Software team has reached the final phase.



We will
soon work on packaging design for shipping. If we succeed in our first
goal, new molding form will be prepared. This is where we need your help.

</div></div>","The most advanced thermal imaging sensor for motorsports
TireX is a thermal imaging sensor that visualizes how your tires are working, in real time.  Use it to tune your suspension for maximum grip and balance.

Next-generation technology
TireX uses the most advanced sensor technology in its class. Not only does it have superior accuracy and thermal compensation than current sensors, it's thermal array design allows applications beyond measuring tire temperatures. There's no sensor like TireX at any price!
Better grip, faster lap times, win races
TireX will show you how evenly your tires are working, helping you identify where to make changes to your suspension.  Maximize your tire's grip to get faster lap times and win races.

* See the FAQ for additional resource on interpreting tire temperatures!
 
Wide field of view works with your tight fenders and wide tires
110 degree field of view (FOV) simultaneously reads multiple zones across your tire.

See the FAQ for a guide on how far to mount TireX away from your tire!
 
Up to 16 temperature zones supported
You can select 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 temperature zones per tire, enabling fine resolution when you need it - up to 64 channels of data with 16 zones and 4 corners!
Actual real-time 16 channel thermal data (cup of hot water for demonstration)
Assign each sensor to a vehicle corner
Each TireX sensor can be assigned to a corner of the vehicle, reporting each sensor's position with zones properly reporting inside edge to outside, regardless of left or right location on the vehicle.
Rugged and compact

TireX was carefully designed to keep a low profile mounting in mind, and specifically for mounting above the front tires to minimize steering-induced reading errors.
High quality connectors
TireX comes with a rugged and compact industrial M8 connector for integrating with your wiring harness. 

You only need 4 wires if you're doing your own wiring: 12v power, ground and two CAN bus connections.

However, you can choose our ready-made four-corner plug and play harness, saving hours of wiring time:

 
RaceCapture owners
Choose both the plug and play harness and the Powered CAN hub + RaceCapture integration cable add-on-perk to make a 100% plug and play solution - no custom wiring!
Compatible with Podium real time telemetry
Easily analyze tire temperatures right from the pits and figure out what you need to tune before the car even comes into the pits! Three unique data visualizations are offered for TireX - optimized equally well for real-time data as well as after-session review. Learn more about Podium To play with this data directly, find the 'Tire Temperature simulation' event at Sonoma Raceway on the Podium app!
Compatible with most popular data systems
Simple CAN bus protocol makes integration easy with virtually any modern data system supporting CAN bus, such as AiM, MoTeC, AEM and more, with presets available for download.See the finalized CAN bus protocol for the complete documentation.
Advanced thermal imaging mode
The capabilities of TireX go beyond measuring tire temperatures: The 16 x 12 thermal imaging sensor generates 192 channels of data that you can use to monitor hot spots on your race car in real time, while on track.  You can use it with Podium real time telemetry, or with any analysis package capable of visualizing this advanced data!

Inspirational simulated example :)
 

Actual thermal image real-time telemetry with Podium
Next generation technology
Not only does TireX support advanced thermal imaging capabilities, its latest generation sensor technology offers approximately 2x better noise performance and improved thermal compensation vs. other sensors in its class.Want to compare existing first generation sensors? Those are the devices that specify 120, 60, or 40 degree field of view (FOV).

Plug and play harness option
Save hours on installation time! The optional plug and play harness makes it incredibly easy to wire and minimizes errors - just plug the sensors into the harness, then run the loop around your vehicle, locating a sensor at each corner.  
After routing, it's just two wires for data, and two wires for 12v and Ground!
CAN bus protocol - ready to go!
TireX's CAN bus protocol is finalized and ready to be integrated with your system. See the protocol information on our wiki,
Fully customizable
All of TireX's settings can be customized via software (CAN bus) command, and these settings are saved in non-volatile flash memory so they are retained across power cycles.

<br/><p><b>How long does the battery stay charged?</b></p>
<p>This is different for every ride, and rider.  Your FLAUNT Electric Bicycle boasts a larger battery than most, and therefore you can achieve higher range than most eBikes on the market today.  For a 160lb rider, on flat ground, you should be able to reach 40+ miles without needing a recharge.  Variables that can affect these results are: wind, terrain, hills, weight of rider, pedal power. <b><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flaunt-electric-bicycle/payments/new?perk_id=3709169"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extra Battery Charger</a> and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flaunt-electric-bicycle/payments/new?perk_id=3709168"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extra Battery</a> available for purchase.</b></p>

<p><b>What is Walk Assist?</b></p>
<p>Walk Assist is a function that we have implemented to help people walk their eBikes should they ever want, or need to.  This feature is most beneficial when trying to walk your eBike up a steep hill, or through rough terrain. Simply turn on your FLAUNT Electric Bicycle, and then press the [ + ] on the thumb controller for 5 seconds. Your eBike will enter into “Walk Assist” mode, and begin to travel at 5mph, so all you have to do is hold on!</p>

<p><b>Are headlights and rear lights included when I purchase the eBike?</b></p>
<p>Yes. When the eBike is powered on, the brake light will illuminate when the brake lever is squeezed, notifying people and cars behind you, that you are slowing down.  When the bike is powered on, one tap of the power button on the thumb controller will illuminate the Front Headlight, the Rear Brake Light, as well as the LCD Display.<br/><br/></p>

<p><b>What is Advanced Sine Wave Technology?</b></p>
<p>Sine Wave Technology, utilized in Sine Wave Controllers (like the controllers on FLAUNT Electric Bicycles), exhibit a more smooth and rounded signal than a “Square Wave Controller” (like found on electric bikes with direct drive motors).  Square Wave Controllers send their signal more abruptly, similar to an on-off switch, where as a Sine Wave Controller is a smoother transition of the electric signals, providing for a much quieter ride!   </p>

<p><b>Can I ride my eBike like a regular bicycle if I choose to? </b></p>
<p>Of course, actually
there are a couple of ways to do this. 
The easiest way would be to keep the eBike powered off, hop on, and
pedal away!  However, if you’d like to
have the power on, maybe for the lights, simply press the [-] button on the
thumb controller, until the pedal assist level reads “0” (zero) on the LCD
Display</p>
<p><b>Can
I go off-road with my eBike and use it for outdoor recreation?</b></p>
<p>Yes, of course.  Our eBikes are made for the every day rider,
so light off road trails are not a problem. Just don’t attempt any cliff jumps,
we do not advise that!</p>
<p><b>-Are there add-ons for purchase (ie. accessories, extra
batteries, helmets, etc)?</b></p>
<p>Yes, please view the

</div></div>","FLAUNT offers over 20 features and two different models, Vicko & Atticus.



                             



How is FLAUNT different from other eBikes on the market? 
For starters, we have one of the best & safest stock batteries in our class, a 36 Volt 15.6 Amp Samsung Lithium Battery pack, that allows you to get over 560 true Watt Hours!  Also, our eBikes look, sound, and feel like normal bicycles. 

FLAUNT Electric Bicycles ride very smooth, without vibrations, and are super silent.Our eBikes offer 6 different levels of pedal assist, and you don’t have to fumble around with buttons or change settings to switch from pedal assist to throttle. On our eBikes, you can switch seamlessly between the two!  
We offer a powerful 500 Watt (geared) Motor.  Geared motors are great for hills, and allow us to incorporate a free-wheel within the motor, so when you pedal, there’s no resistance from the motor like on an electric bike with a direct drive motor.  
Our eBikes also come with integrated headlights, tail, and brake lights.  FLAUNT’s beautiful LCD Display is one of the best looking and most functional displays on the market today….it also lights up! 


                                                                        COLORS: Matte Blue, Matte Gray, Matte Red, Matte Black                                                             Order Atticus here. 



                      COLORS: Matte Aqua, Matte Black, Glossy White                                                                             Order Vicko here.





How long does the battery stay charged?
This is different for every ride, and rider.  Your FLAUNT Electric Bicycle boasts a larger battery than most, and therefore you can achieve higher range than most eBikes on the market today.  For a 160lb rider, on flat ground, you should be able to reach 40+ miles without needing a recharge.  Variables that can affect these results are: wind, terrain, hills, weight of rider, pedal power. Extra Battery Charger and Extra Battery available for purchase.
 
What is Walk Assist?
Walk Assist is a function that we have implemented to help people walk their eBikes should they ever want, or need to.  This feature is most beneficial when trying to walk your eBike up a steep hill, or through rough terrain. Simply turn on your FLAUNT Electric Bicycle, and then press the [ + ] on the thumb controller for 5 seconds. Your eBike will enter into “Walk Assist” mode, and begin to travel at 5mph, so all you have to do is hold on!


  
Are headlights and rear lights included when I purchase the eBike?
Yes. When the eBike is powered on, the brake light will illuminate when the brake lever is squeezed, notifying people and cars behind you, that you are slowing down.  When the bike is powered on, one tap of the power button on the thumb controller will illuminate the Front Headlight, the Rear Brake Light, as well as the LCD Display.

 



 


What is Advanced Sine Wave Technology?
Sine Wave Technology, utilized in Sine Wave Controllers (like the controllers on FLAUNT Electric Bicycles), exhibit a more smooth and rounded signal than a “Square Wave Controller” (like found on electric bikes with direct drive motors).  Square Wave Controllers send their signal more abruptly, similar to an on-off switch, where as a Sine Wave Controller is a smoother transition of the electric signals, providing for a much quieter ride!   

 

 









                                                          ""I really loved it, it was so easy and fast!"" 
                               ""I got it up to 25mph no problem... LOVE IT!""
""It was very easy to use... I've never been on an electric bike, but now I want one.""

                                        ""The pedal assist...insane!""  

             ""It goes as fast as I drive (in Los Angeles)... I'll save on gas!""

<p><strong>What features does the Riptide's hand controller have?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Two Rider Modes - Beginner and Advanced - are selectable on-the-fly</li>
<li>Reverse with Smart Activation</li>
<li>Regenerative and Active Braking</li>
<li>Soft-start for smooth acceleration off the line</li>
<li>Low Battery ramp to reduce voltage sag, and low battery braking enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>The remote is independently FCC certified, 16-channel (2402-2480 MHz) Bluetooth connected with auto-binding, and an effective range of 14 meters with no interference. </p>
<p>The remote charges with the included micro-USB cable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I take the Riptide on an airplane?</strong></p>
<p>The Riptide comes with a 97Wh battery. Its UN-38.3 approved and airline friendly. We can’t guarantee it can go on any flight as every airline has their own rules, but the battery and board do fit in with the general TSA regulations to bring as a carry on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/><strong>What kind of battery does the Riptide have?</strong></p>
<p>The current battery is 6S3P (21.6v nominal / 25.2v max, 4.5Ah total) lithium ion 18650 rated at 8C max continuous discharge.  BMS is currently 30A continuous / 60A peak, with all standard safety protection plus cell balancing.  Running high-discharge cells in a 3P configuration gives the Riptide enough amperage to handle heavy loads when it needs it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What type of motors does the Riptide have?</strong></p>
<p>The Riptide has dual belt drive motors with 1800 watts of peak power. These are brushless sensorless DC motors, similar to what you’d find on a DJI drone, but bigger. We picked belt drive over hub motors because our thesis with the Riptide is all about maximum performance in a small package, and belts drives allow for better torque delivery to maximize acceleration and hill climbing. It’s true that belts will wear down over time but it’s a quick 5 minute replacement and we felt that it was worth it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is the Riptide waterproof?</strong></p>
<p>The board is not waterproof. We’ve made a lot of design decisions to make it as water resistant as possible, though. You can ride through irrigation runoff or the occasional puddle, but we don’t recommend riding in wet conditions - not when it’s raining or right after it has rained - as you may damage the electronics and rust the bearings. Also it’s extremely dangerous to ride in conditions with reduced traction, both for your board AND because of the cars around you.</p>
<p>The battery box is fully sealed, and partitioned to seal battery compartment and motor controller compartments independently. We chose sensorless motors to further reduce susceptibility to water, and made many components easily serviceable for regular maintenance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Does the Riptide have regenerative braking?</strong></p>
<p>The Riptide employs multiple types of braking technologies that allow it to smoothly and quickly slow down and come to a complete stop.  This includes integrating both regenerative braking and active braking, similar to technolgies seen in the Mellow Drive and ZBoard.    </p>
<p>The Riptide also has variable braking strength, which means that you have more dynamic control over braking speed than an on-or-off pre-programmed braking curve used by some other brands.</p>
<p>And when the battery is fully depleted, braking is still possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the weight limit?</strong></p>

What People Are Saying

 
""The R1 is fast out of the gate, with the maneuverability of a standard-size deck. So far, it's come closest to what I've been looking for on all fronts: size, price and power.""- Engadget
""Say Hi to one of the best electric skateboards we've ever used."" -TechnoBuffalo
On the Boosted hitting those railroad tracks is rough. This thing is super nimble... Taking this hill like a boss, no problem! - Press Reset
The brakes work really well. No jerkiness or grab to it. Its nice and smooth with strong braking power. - NYC EBoarding Club Member
 

How it Compares

The Riptide is the first board to pack the power and top speed of a premium board into a compact package. Thus, the specifications are closer to that of a $1299 board than to other affordable options.

See how the Riptide compares to the industry leading, $1299 Boosted Board

How it Works

Simply grab the wireless hand controller and roll your thumb forward to accelerate. Roll it downward to brake. Flip a switch to toggle between beginner and advanced modes. Tap a button to engage reverse functionality.
 

 

The R1 vs. the R1 Elite

Our product line includes two Models: The R1 and the R1 Elite.

Both boards come with <99Wh airline-friendly batteries. R1E wheels provided by ABEC11. R1E lights provided by Shredlights. Power is the peak power rating.
Both boards will recharge in approximately 3.5 hours. We also offer a fast charger that will recharge the battery in as little as 90 mins.

Use Cases

Built by Riders, for Riders
The Riptide was built by boarders with other boarders in mind. First timers will enjoy the board as well (likely in beginner mode) and individuals with past boarding experience (whether its surfing, snowboarding, skateboard, wakeboarding, etc) will appreciate the raw power right away, and will recognize how the nuances including the kicktail, wheel, and truck selection, really contribute to the ride quality.

 
Perfect for Students On Campus
The Riptide's high power and affordable price make it perfect for riding around campus, and its small size mean you can slide it under a desk without headache. 

 
Urban Commuting Just Got Easier
The Riptide's compact deck and handles make it easy bring on a train or to throw into the trunk of an Uber. The large, soft wheels make the board perfect for poor city pavement. And lastly, the inclusion of headlights and tail lights will help other drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists see you at busy intersections at low light.

 
Traveling? Bring your Riptide
The Riptide comes with a precisely engineered battery capacity that is within the range of TSA guidelines. Once you're past security the small size and handles make the R1 a breeze to transport through the terminal or to check into the overhead compartment.

 
The Perfect Addition to Your Electric Skateboard Quiver
Everyone who rides an electric skateboard knows it more fun to ride with friends (or your wife / husband / kid / grandma / etc). With a Riptide as your second board now you've got something they can ride at a competitive price that can actually keep up with more premium boards.

Order now on our website!
 

Features

A Serious Drive Train 
The R1's 1800W dual belt drive train means it can scream off the line up to the top speed of 20 mph and power up hills unlike any other board its size.

 
Unrivaled Portability
At only 13 lbs with a 31"" deck, dual handles, and an airline-friendly, and <99Wh battery, you can easily bring the R1 wherever your travels take you.

 
Premium Longboard Components
With the R1 our goal was a fast, fun ride while maintaining portability and we didn't mind adding a pound or two getting there. Thus the board has 245mm wide trucks and comes with the large diameter, soft urethane wheels by ABEC 11, a top-of-the-line wheel manufacturer.

 
Ride for Miles and Miles
With up-to-an 8 miles of range in real world conditions and an optional fast charger that recharges the board in just 90 mins, you'll be able to park your car for the weekend and not touch it til Monday.

 
Ride All Night
Optional Headlights and Tail Lights provided by Shredlights can be set to ""On,"" ""Blink,"" or ""High Beam,"" meaning you can ride all night and be seen by everyone around you.

 

Perks

Our campaign perks include two models of the Riptide R1 Electric Skateboard. Our base model - the R1 - packs major power into a compact package. Our premium model - the R1 Elite - offers increased speed and range while adding premium headlights / tail lights along with soft-riding ABEC 11 wheels.

Manufacturing Timeline



Use of Funds

Battery Box Injection Molding
The Riptide has a custom battery box, designed and prototyped in California. Several rounds of design, 3D printing, and CNC were completed to ensure proper fitment of the battery and controller, gasket and grommet seals to keep water out, structural strength, heat dissipation, and ideal placement of power switch, charge port, and our custom battery meter.
The design is now complete. Some of your funds will go towards the plastic injection molds necessary to produce our battery box and lid in high volumes.
 
Battery Certification
The R1's battery uses UL-certified lithium ion cells in a 6S3P arrangement, with all standard safety protection plus cell balancing.  Running high-discharge cells in a 3P configuration gives the Riptide more amperage output capability than other boards on the market to handle heavy loads when it needs it.
The design is now finalized. Funds from our Indiegogo project will go towards certifications to verify that the board fits TSA and other guidelines for air travel, sea freight, etc.
 
Factory Minimums
The R1 will be produced by our partners in Shenzhen, CN. We considered several potential manufacturers and selected our partner through many rounds of sampling and after checking several references. Indiegogo funds will go towards hitting our factory minimums.

There are all kinds of projects, companies and people uploading stuff everyday. When you are checking out a crowdfunding project, it's a great idea to do some due diligence so you can judge how trustworthy the campaigners are.</font></p>
<p><font>This is Unlimited’s second crowdfunding project. We learned a TON from our last campaign, which we fully delivered with a product that was significantly better than we initially offered, in every way. It took time and it was incredibly hard, for us, our families and for our dear backers. Thanks to that experience, we are now able to offer a super good product that leverages all the technology we developed, but also do better in terms of pricing, where we sell, timeline and overall execution of the project.</font></p>
<p><font>At Unlimited, we are 1000% committed to delivering to our backers. We are a Techstars-backed company! Fully running since 2016 and we have been delivering top-of-the-line products and supporting our customers and backers every single day for 3 years now. Late in 2018 we partnered with the best longboard brand in the world: Loaded Boards. We’ve been working on this eBike product for more than a year (4 if you consider that the tech was developed in the skateboard!) and we now partnered with Detroit Bikes, one of the largest manufacturers of bicycles in the US! They have the experience and track record of making great bikes.</font></p>

We faced countless technical challenges with the battery management system, motor control algorithms, wireless communication, bad supplier choices, the list is long. We had to learn our way around Asia and develop relationships with the suppliers and a whole supply chain for a product that didn’t exist down to the smallest component. We had to learn about international trading and even how political situations or pandemics can affect the whole operation! Above all that, we had to learn our way on how to run a company with very little resources</font></p>
<p><font>Thankfully, we have all that now, the tech is working great and being improved daily because we have firmware upgrades and remote diagnostics. Our team is now super experienced and our suppliers love working with us.

YES!Check out our Does it fit my bike? page for detailed specifications.Check the 3 items below just to make sure:OPEN DROPOUTS. Your front forks or frame (rear motor) need to accept the standard axle with open dropout (where the wheel is attached). Wheel axles come in quick-release (most common) or bolt-on (fixie, bmx, Brompton, cruisers, older bikes).Dropout width: the distance between the inner faces of the fork must be 74 mm or 100 mm. Please make sure our motors will work with your bike. REAR MOTOR (OPTIONAL): If you are interested in a rear motor, frame and drivetrain requirements are as follows.- Dropout: 135 mm open width (not compatible with Brompton/folding or ""Track/Fixie"" bikes)- Drivetrain: cassette (Shimano HG spline - usually 7-12 gears) or threaded freewheel (usually <7 gears or single speed). WHEEL SIZE. We build the motor wheel to any of the below wheel sizes 16” to 29"", great for city, trekking, mtb, gravel or road bikes. We will send you a survey (and help you figure it out) after the campaign is done.  BRAKES. Disc or rim compatible. So no issues here! Check out our Does it fit my bike? page if you still  have questions.  Delivery timelineSince we are leveraging our technology base and well-established supply chain, we are certain we can stick to this timeline. Proven Team and TechnologyBorn in Barcelona in 2016 out of a group of good friends, the Unlimited team is dedicated to transforming the future urban mobility. With really strong technical backgrounds (including a PhD in engineering, 3 masters in engineering, and an MBA from MIT), the Unlimited crew teamed up to build cutting-edge electric vehicles.  We initially launched an electric skateboard conversion kit via crowdfunding in 2016 that quickly sold out, has been completely fulfilled and gets rave reviews. eSkate is considered the most demanding electric vehicle application in regards to vibration, impact resistance, power and energy density. Since 2018, Unlimited partnered with Loaded Boards (unlimitedxloaded.com) to offer top rated electric skateboard conversion kits and complete boards.“We couldn't have picked a more passionate, dedicated and capable team to partner with. Since day one it's been a pleasure to work with them and we look forward to a bright future together” Don Tashman - CEO @ Loaded We learned a lot from our first crowdfunding, and we’re incredibly thankful for the backers who believed in our vision. Our backers where with us the whole way as we learned how to manufacture and deliver our new technology, and we couldn’t have done it without their encouragement and support.Now we decided to get much further along in the design and manufacturing process before launching. With the Unlimited Electric Skateboard, we hadn’t even met our manufacturer when we launched. This time we’ve been working with them for four years straight, and they’ve been a part of our new powertrain design since day one. We are already into the tooling phase for the product, which means we are testing the initial mechanical parts straight from the factory. We’ve tested multiple electrical designs, optimizing for international certifications and long-term quality. And our firmware and software development is well underway, which means the prototypes you see in the videos are actually working! In short, we’re in the final stages of manufacturing and delivering the Unlimited eBike, and it’s going great.Of course, with any new product and the current global situation there are factors that we cannot foresee. For your peace of mind, this is not our first product and we have years of experience with a well established global supply chain. We’re inviting you into the process with us, so you’ll get to see how it all works. We’ll be posting lots of updates during the final phases of development and manufacturing, and we’re excited to share the journey with you.  Duties, VAT and Taxes. We are doing everything possible in order to reduce costs to our backers and streamline delivery. As such, the perks do not include Duties, VAT/GST or Taxes as these depend on many factors. Duties/VAT/GST are to be paid before we can deliver your Unlimited eBike kit or WARP eBike. We will send payment links, invoice overview and ask for a final delivery address confirmation before we ship. In the EU, VAT is 21%In the US, Duty is 5% and Sales Tax depends on each state.  Latest Articles:                   CUSTOMER TESTIMONIALS PR LINKShttps://electrek.co/2020/05/27/unlimited-e-bike-kit-diy-ebike-conversion-simple/https://www.netzwelt.de/news/178729-fahrrad-e-bike-unlimited-ebike-kit-verspricht-umbau-binnen-minuten.htmlhttp://www.cnet.com/news/skateboard-electric-unlimited-x-loaded-conversion-kit/https://electrek.co/2019/07/09/unlimited-loaded-new-electric-skateboard-kit/https://www.trustedreviews.com/opinion/why-you-should-back-the-eon-a-powertrain-that-makes-any-skateboard-electric-2936978https://newatlas.com/eon-electric-skate-drive/44466/https://uncrate.com/unlimited-x-loaded-electric-skateboard-conversion-kits/ FAQIs this a donation or will I actually get a kit/bikeAll crowdfunding projects have a certain associated risk. There are all kinds of projects, companies and people uploading stuff everyday. When you are checking out a crowdfunding project, it's a great idea to do some due diligence so you can judge how trustworthy the campaigners are.
This is Unlimited’s second crowdfunding project. We learned a TON from our last campaign, which we fully delivered with a product that was significantly better than we initially offered, in every way. It took time and it was incredibly hard, for us, our families and for our dear backers. Thanks to that experience, we are now able to offer a super good product that leverages all the technology we developed, but also do better in terms of pricing, where we sell, timeline and overall execution of the project.
At Unlimited, we are 1000% committed to delivering to our backers. We are a Techstars-backed company! Fully running since 2016 and we have been delivering top-of-the-line products and supporting our customers and backers every single day for 3 years now. Late in 2018 we partnered with the best longboard brand in the world: Loaded Boards. We’ve been working on this eBike product for more than a year (4 if you consider that the tech was developed in the skateboard!) and we now partnered with Detroit Bikes, one of the largest manufacturers of bicycles in the US! They have the experience and track record of making great bikes.
We are here for the long run and we will take any necessary steps to deliver!Does it fit my bike?The Unlimited eBike Kit really is compatible with almost any bike. If your bike has a quick release or bolt-on front axle (the thingy that holds the wheel to the fork), chances are it will work. Some exceptions include bikes with high-end suspension forks (as they have thru-axles) or very weird/vintage wheel sizes.How does it all work?The Unlimited eBike Kit   makes any bike a pedal-assisted bike. This means it will provide electrically powered assist when you pedal. The pedal sensor detects your pedalling motion and immediately tells the motor controller to drive the motor via Bluetooth 5 Low Energy. Simple? It is! You can fine-tune how it all feels through our mobile app!What happens if I don’t have the handlebar-mounted screen?You can use the Unlimited eBike Kit without any screen. You can also mount your smartphone on the handlebar and open our app which includes a super sleek dashboard. The screen saves you from draining the battery in your phone and also gives you quick access to information and options so it’s great to have though!What range can you get?Unlimited! with pedaling!. It pedals just like a normal bike and there is no motor drag. With pedal assist, typical riders can expect around 20-50 miles of assisted riding, depending on how the use the energy, the gradient, wind, and several other factors. Range figures are estimates and not a guarantee that you will achieve them.Can I use the bike without the battery?YES. The motor is completely drag-free and feels like a normal hub when rolling. Our intention is that people can still enjoy the analog bike when they feel like it without complicated changes! Just remove the battery and make sure the motor wire is safely grabbed with the provided clips so it’s not hanging around and you’re good to go.How frequently do you need to charge the battery in the pedal sensor?If you commute daily the battery will need recharging every 3-6 months depending on how long your commute is.How easy is it really to install the pedal sensor?We know most pedal sensors can be a pain to install with wires, alignment, and connectors. For these reasons we are convinced that our pedal sensor is a game changer, it literally takes no longer than 5 seconds to install.Does the pedal sensor need to be on the left or right crank arm specifically?You can install it in whichever crank arm you think works best for you or your bike, it does not matter which side. You can configure this from the app.What are the dimensions of the pedal sensor?The pedal sensor is 75 mm x 30 mm x 13 mm.What are the dimensions and weight of each battery?The SL battery is 220 mm x 84 mm x 51 mm. Height is increased by 12 mm when the mounting baseplate is considered. Weight is 1.1 kg.
The XR battery is  356 mm x 84 mm x 51 mm. Height is increased by 12 mm when the mounting baseplate is considered. Weight is 1.9 kg.What are the electrical specs of the batteries?All cells utilized are top quality Samsung or LG 18650 cells.
The small battery is a 52 V, 151 Wh small little piece of dense energy!
The big battery is also 52 V but 353 Wh, also super dense for its size!
You can note that voltage is higher than in most other ebikes and this enables a higher efficiency system =).Is the powertrain waterproof?YES! The system is sealed to IP65 rating!Is the kit strictly for front wheels?The front wheel is clearly the easiest to swap and the most similar among existing bike standards. But we understand that some people (especially for mtb use) might want a rear motor so we have added it as an add-on.What if I run out of battery?If you run out of battery, you can just pedal the bike normally. Rolling resistance was a high priority for us when designing the powertrain, because our intention is that our customers use the bike also without the battery from time to time. Therefore, we included a one-way clutch in the motors which eliminates all resistance from the motor when rolling forward. It feels like a normal wheel!What about spare parts?Any part directly related to the electric powertrain you can get from us aftermarket. We are a fully operational company supporting thousands of customers for our electric skateboard product. In case you get the fully assembled Unlimited Warp eBike from us, all components not related to the electric powertrain are fairly standard and any local bike shop will be able to help you out!Do I need a license to use this electric powertrain?No, both the Unlimited eBike Kit and the Unlimited Warp eBike are no different than any other eBike out there in that sense, which don’t require a license in the US and EU. Note you can’t run a throttle in the EU.Can I change the tire that comes with the kit?YES. It is a standard bicycle tire for the wheel size you selected. You can change it whenever you want to the tire of your personal preference or have a local shop do it for you.What tire sizes do you recommend for the kit?Tire size is, to some extent, related to rim width and riding purpose. Tire diameter needs to be in accordance with your wheel size, but you can use different widths depending on what you want. The best size would be the one that came stock with your bike. Remember to always check what is the width limit that your bike/fork/brakes can take.Can we choose motor and rim color?Unfortunately, we are already offering lots of options for customers in relation to the wheel size and type of motor, so we decided to simplify things regarding color and keep fully black rims and motors for this campaign. Any decent bike shop can re-lace the motor to your rim of preference, so it shouldn't be a big deal if a full rim match is critical for you.What accessories can I run with the kit?The battery comes with a fully ready accessory output wire. By getting the correct accessory and wire harness, you can run:

Handlebar-mounted minimalist display
Handlebar-mounted throttle (not in EU due to local regulations)
High-efficiency front and rear lights will be available in the near future
Left and right brake sensors
What does the WiFi do?Once you set up the WiFi, you can choose for the powertrain to update itself automatically when charging at home. This way you don’t have to worry about it, and it’ll always be up to date. We also gather battery health/usage data to understand your battery better and use this information to improve the product through firmware updates while also providing a world-class customer support if any issues should arise.What is the weight limit of the kit?Our motors are rated to 130 kg (286 lbs) of load capacity. The bike is designed to the same spec.Can I upgrade my product after I make my first purchase?YES. Just like our electric skateboard product, you are not fixed to what you first get. Many of our customers start with the option that fits them best at the time of purchase, but then get upgrades later as they want to. For example, you can get extra batteries (and even connect them at the same time!), accessories, bigger battery, etc., all after using your initial product.What if I change bikes/wheels?All batteries are compatible with all bikes. All motors fit 100 mm x 9 mm dropouts except for the 16” (Brompton) and 20” (folding) pre-built wheels which fit 74 mm dropouts. If you change bikes, you should be able to easily swap the motor to the new bike. If you change bikes to a bike with a different wheel size but compatible dropout width, your local bike shop should be able to lace the correct rim size to your motor.  If you change bikes to a bike with a very different dropout (e.g. from a 28"" to a Brompton), you might have to change the motor too. Contact us in such a scenario first so we can assess your case and get you the best solution!How do I know which size of frame is a good fit for me?Bike sizing is a matter of ergonomics but to some extent, personal preference too. If you are familiar with conventional bike geometry, just take a look at our geometry chart. If you are still unsure don’t hesitate to contact us! In addition, local bike shops are great places to try out bikes of different sizes and get a feel for what “reach” and top tube height you like, while also enjoying good coffee and getting to know your local bike community!Does it have regenerative braking?Rolling resistance was a high priority for us when designing the powertrain, because our intention is that our customers use the bike also without the battery from time to time. Therefore, we included a one-way clutch in the motors which eliminates all resistance from the motor when rolling forward but disables the possibility of regenerative braking.How is the bike on handling uphill terrain?Uphill performance depends on how steep the hill is and the total weight of bike plus rider. The motor is a big help though, but sometimes people will need to pedal harder to get it up steep hills. No damage can be done to the motor or system by pushing the limits though, as it is all handled automatically by our fantastic control system.Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT/GST?The backer is responsible for these costs. Please check your country's import duties/VAT/GST before purchasing. Duties/VAT/GST is to be paid before we can deliver your Unlimited ebike product. We will send a payment link with invoice overview and ask for a final delivery address confirmation before we ship your product.I live in Spain or Europe, can I pick it up myself?YES. For our last crowdfunding we had backers come pickup all over from Europe! In fact, we did a little delivery party with our local backers from Barcelona. Beers, riding, and good times! Please reach out if you are a local backer and want to meet and pick it up yourself so that we can plan for this!My bike box arrived damaged. What should i do?If there is visible damage to your Unlimited box that appears to have damaged the product in any way, please notify the courier immediately as they are held responsible for all damage caused in transit. Request documentation from them stating that you have received a box with visible damages. You will need this for insurance purposes to qualify for a replacement bike or any affected components.Why is my bike or kit spec’d with a component that differs from that listed on your campaign?The Unlimited eBike Kit and Warp eBike are in production (with orders standing by for final quantity as we are waiting for the campaign!). Therefore, some components are subject to change if we find better, more suitable options. Once past this stage, we will continue to reserve the right to switch components for ones of equal or higher value. The purpose of this is to ensure that the customer continues to get the best product and there are no delays in delivery.Will the production bikes be exactly like the ones pictured?They will be even better. We have a few tweaks and we are still to put final orders in, so we reserve the right to make modifications to improve the bike while keeping the cost. We’ve already made some upgrades based on thousands of miles of real world riding and feedback from test riders around the world.Why did we take so long on our last campaign and why will that be different this time? Being first timers last time was a huge learning experience in so many ways. We had to develop EVERYTHING, because we did not use any standard off-the-shelf common/cheap components, and even though we know we could, it was a lot harder than we initially thought. We faced countless technical challenges with the battery management system, motor control algorithms, wireless communication, bad supplier choices, the list is long. We had to learn our way around Asia and develop relationships with the suppliers and a whole supply chain for a product that didn’t exist down to the smallest component. We had to learn about international trading and even how political situations or pandemics can affect the whole operation! Above all that, we had to learn our way on how to run a company with very little resources
Thankfully, we have all that now, the tech is working great and being improved daily because we have firmware upgrades and remote diagnostics. Our team is now super experienced and our suppliers love working with us. Owning all the tech allows us to evolve fast to other vehicles and this is what we did with this new product, we are very far into the product development and basically only waiting for the success of the campaign to commit to tooling and costly stuff!Can I get a refund?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here: https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles...
If you change your mind after the campaign is closed, we will refund you 75% of the amount on your Indiegogo campaign contribution. That said, sometimes customers ask for a refund at a time where it might be difficult (for example, after we have placed orders with the manufacturers) so we reserve the right to refund or not.Can I change my order?Yes, it is possible to upgrade or downgrade your product. If we are still in the campaign period, the best way is to ask for a refund is through your profile on Indiegogo where you’ll find a “refund” button. And then “back” a new perk/make the order again. If the order is locked and you are transferred to our database, you can always order upgrades, but if you want changes in your order that are not upgrades we will charge an additional 50EUR fee. Chat with us if you need help making a decision or figuring out if it works on your bike! We are here to help and answer any questions!click here to chat   DisclaimerAs all products offered in the campaign are still in production, Unlimited reserves the right to change specifications such as colors, size/geometry and other features in order to improve the product or delivery schedule.We have access to assembly and distribution facilities in Europe (HQ), Hong Kong, LA and Detroit, and have designed a logistics structure to ensure minimal costs and timely delivery.

</h3><div>It is a 3-speed bicycle front gearbox that can replace your awkward front derailleur.</div><div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1197555/files/20150204174122-efneo-gearbox-slideshow-3slides.gif?1423100482"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Efneo look inspired by brands like Porsche and Apple makes it the most elegant and sleek bicycle gearbox on the market.</p>
<br/><h3>How it works?</h3>
<p>Efneo is a planetary gearbox. One chainring rotating at three different speeds on each gear. It is an equivalent to a 28/40/50T front crankset. </p>
<p>This video shows how it works<b>:</b></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F110797045&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F110797045&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F495174522_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>What is important is that the <b>gear ratios</b> are pretty much the same as you would expect from a standard 3 chainring derailluer system. That makes it comfortable - the gaps between gears are not too big, not too small.<br/><br/>Please remember one thing. The Efneo Gearbox, like almost all other planetary gearboxes available on the market, has one specific feature<b>:</b><br/><ul>
<li>you can upshift with full load (e.g. you can push the pedals with all your strength and change the gear to the higher one).</li>
<li>when you want to downshift, you need to stop pushing for a fraction of a second to let the gear change. It's very easy to get accustomed to it and after a while you will do it without thinking about it.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Kickass features</h3>
<p>There are at least <b>FIVE </b>reasons why you should have the Efneo Gearbox on your bike<b>:</b></p>

<p>Efneo gearbox is
dedicated for all kinds of bicycles excluding off-road applications like MTB,
downhill, dirt, etc.</p>
<p>It is perfect for a
<b>city/urban bike, for trekking, hybrid, folding, recumbent &amp; trike</b>.</p>
<p>If you have an
<b>e-bike with a rear wheel engine</b>, the Efneo Gearbox is also for you. After installing the Efneo Gearbox you'll get a super-comfortable e-bike with better weight balance.<br/></p>

It is a perfect upgrade for a <b>single-speed</b> bike. With the Efneo Gearbox your beautiful bike still looks clean and cool, and riding gets easier.<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Remember - the Efneo Gearbox <b>is not</b> dedicated for off-road applications (MTB, downhill, dirt, trial, etc.). Sorry. We have done our best to make the gearbox reliable and robust, but if you want to do things like this<b>:</b></p>

<p>better choose some <b>other </b>stuff ;-)<br/></p>
<p>It will <b>not work</b> properly with a <b>fixie bike that has no freewheel in a rear wheel. </b>However - it works perfectly with a single-speed and still looks so clean and cute!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Efneo Gearbox on e-bike</h3>
<p>If you have an e-bike with a rear wheel engine, you can have even more advantages with the Efneo Gearbox. The gearbox <b>affects positively your bike's range</b>.</p>
<p>The battery consumption is the highest in three situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>when starting</li>
<li>when climbing uphill</li>
<li>when cruising at maximum speed</li>
</ol>
<p>In all these cases <b>the gearbox helps you to support your engine and reduce the battery consumption considerably</b>, so that you improve your bike's range:</p>
<ol>
<li>when starting you can downshift easily to the first gear and add some power from your muscles much easier than with a big front chainring (remember - you cannot do this with a derailleur if you do not downshift before stopping; and we forget to do this so often...)<br/>
</li>
<li>the same is with climbing uphill - you can help your engine without getting too tired (hmm - that was the reason to buy an e-bike - not to get too tired :-)</li>
<li>when cruising at speed around 20mph/35kph it's very difficult to add any torque with a chainring of about 40T; you need a bigger front chainring to pedal effectively and to support your engine; here we come with our third gear that is an equivalen to 50T (the biggest front chainring used in popular bicycle models is usually 46T)</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, you can also improve your range by purchasing a bigger battery :-). But even in this case if your battery finally turns off, it's always much better to have a multi-gear system on your bike!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>How to put it on my bike?</h3>
<p>We assume 90% of our customers will simply take the gearbox to the nearest bike shop to install it, but if you really like doing things yourself, take a look at the ""how to install"" video and see how <b>easy </b>it is<b>:</b><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F117575597&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F117575597&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F504325132_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<br/>
We are planning deliveries for August 2015.<br/>
<br/><br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>After a series of
tests we are 100% confident the product works as we promise it works, and is durable.</p>
<p>The gearbox will be manufactured with our Japanese manufacturing partner, famous for its highest quality and reliability of its products. This way we are reducing the risks that are always emerging when passing from the ""development phase"" to the ""manufacturing phase"".<br/></p>

However, even the best tests are only tests. We are fully engaged in constant development and enhancement of the product after delivering it to you. If it turns out the product has any ""child age problems"", please contact us immediately and we will do our best to solve the problem (including exchange of the gearbox or even money refund, if no other solution is available).<br/><br/>Based on our testing, we believe the risk that the project fails in a way that we simply do not deliver the product is very low. We are not a big, mature organization, but we have been working on this project for over three years and have spent too much time and money to let it fail.<br/><br/><h3><br/></h3>

</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have fully
functional samples of the Efneo Gearbox that you can see on our movies. They have successfully gone through on-road tests of durability and functionality. We will soon be ready for production.</p>
<p>Though we have big
ambition, we are a small company and only have the capacity to finance limited lots of production, and that elevates our operating capital costs.</p>
<p>You can help us to
increase the volume ordered in a factory so that we can start from an
affordable level of manufacturing costs per unit.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the objective of the Indiegogo campaign is not to finance product development process. We have already invested almost four years of our work and over half million USD in this project.<br/></p>
<p>The reason we need your support is to put the biggest possible first order in a factory (and in fact there are more than one factory - the other is for cranks, the other for gears, the other for shifters etc.). Some of them have so called MOQs (Minimum Order Quantity).</p>
<p>To lower our operating capital costs we decided to offer the gearbox on Indiegogo for a much discounted price!</p>
<p>And here you can read this insightful article on Efneo evolution within these years. You can see there photos of prototypes even from 2012 :)<br/></p>

<p>Believe me - it costs huge amount of cash and work to make a leap from the garage stage in 2012 to this sleek and clean product that you can see now!</p>
<p><b>To sum up - we will deliver the gearboxes to the contributors no matter how much we raise on Indiegogo.</b></p>

</div></div>","IMPORTANT:  The campaign has been successfully funded in 145%, but we have EXTENDED IT!To pre-order:1. click ""select a perk"" on the right side2. choose the package (""Gearbox"" or ""Gearbox for fat bike/e-bike"") and follow the instructionsThe prices will be lifed on a regular basis, to be fair to those, who contributed at the earlier stage. So, the sooner you pre-order, the better price you get. 
What is the Efneo Gearbox?
It is a 3-speed bicycle front gearbox that can replace your awkward front derailleur.


The Efneo look inspired by brands like Porsche and Apple makes it the most elegant and sleek bicycle gearbox on the market.
How it works?
Efneo is a planetary gearbox. One chainring rotating at three different speeds on each gear. It is an equivalent to a 28/40/50T front crankset. 
This video shows how it works:
What is important is that the gear ratios are pretty much the same as you would expect from a standard 3 chainring derailluer system. That makes it comfortable - the gaps between gears are not too big, not too small.Please remember one thing. The Efneo Gearbox, like almost all other planetary gearboxes available on the market, has one specific feature:
you can upshift with full load (e.g. you can push the pedals with all your strength and change the gear to the higher one).
when you want to downshift, you need to stop pushing for a fraction of a second to let the gear change. It's very easy to get accustomed to it and after a while you will do it without thinking about it.



Kickass features
There are at least FIVE reasons why you should have the Efneo Gearbox on your bike:

Perks




Is it for me?


Efneo gearbox is
dedicated for all kinds of bicycles excluding off-road applications like MTB,
downhill, dirt, etc.
It is perfect for a
city/urban bike, for trekking, hybrid, folding, recumbent & trike.
If you have an
e-bike with a rear wheel engine, the Efneo Gearbox is also for you. After installing the Efneo Gearbox you'll get a super-comfortable e-bike with better weight balance.

It is a perfect upgrade for a single-speed bike. With the Efneo Gearbox your beautiful bike still looks clean and cool, and riding gets easier.


Remember - the Efneo Gearbox is not dedicated for off-road applications (MTB, downhill, dirt, trial, etc.). Sorry. We have done our best to make the gearbox reliable and robust, but if you want to do things like this:

better choose some other stuff ;-)
It will not work properly with a fixie bike that has no freewheel in a rear wheel. However - it works perfectly with a single-speed and still looks so clean and cute!

Efneo Gearbox on e-bike
If you have an e-bike with a rear wheel engine, you can have even more advantages with the Efneo Gearbox. The gearbox affects positively your bike's range.
The battery consumption is the highest in three situations:

when starting
when climbing uphill
when cruising at maximum speed

In all these cases the gearbox helps you to support your engine and reduce the battery consumption considerably, so that you improve your bike's range:

when starting you can downshift easily to the first gear and add some power from your muscles much easier than with a big front chainring (remember - you cannot do this with a derailleur if you do not downshift before stopping; and we forget to do this so often...)

the same is with climbing uphill - you can help your engine without getting too tired (hmm - that was the reason to buy an e-bike - not to get too tired :-)
when cruising at speed around 20mph/35kph it's very difficult to add any torque with a chainring of about 40T; you need a bigger front chainring to pedal effectively and to support your engine; here we come with our third gear that is an equivalen to 50T (the biggest front chainring used in popular bicycle models is usually 46T)

Obviously, you can also improve your range by purchasing a bigger battery :-). But even in this case if your battery finally turns off, it's always much better to have a multi-gear system on your bike!

How to put it on my bike?
We assume 90% of our customers will simply take the gearbox to the nearest bike shop to install it, but if you really like doing things yourself, take a look at the ""how to install"" video and see how easy it is:

Take a look here if you want to know how to change a bottom bracket:
Video tutorial ""How to replace a BB""

Does it fit my bike?



Efneo gearbox fits bike frames used for city, urban, single-speed, hybrid, trekking, as well as trikes & recumbent. 
Yes, it also fits bikes with a rear derailleur, no problem (see our movie!)
It fits most of the folding bicycles (but for example not Strida, with an eccentric bottom bracket). If you have any doubts, send us the full name of your bicycle (brand and model) or a photo of the bottom bracket (email: wiktor@efneo.com). We will reply ASAP. 


Product options available
You can choose:


Colour: black or silver


Shifter type: rapidfire (like on our movie ""how it works"") or grip-shift.

Crank length: 170 mm

We will ask you to choose the options about two months before deliveries by e-mail.



What's next?
This is how the timeline looks like:



We are planning deliveries for August 2015.
Risks and challenges


After a series of
tests we are 100% confident the product works as we promise it works, and is durable.
The gearbox will be manufactured with our Japanese manufacturing partner, famous for its highest quality and reliability of its products. This way we are reducing the risks that are always emerging when passing from the ""development phase"" to the ""manufacturing phase"".

However, even the best tests are only tests. We are fully engaged in constant development and enhancement of the product after delivering it to you. If it turns out the product has any ""child age problems"", please contact us immediately and we will do our best to solve the problem (including exchange of the gearbox or even money refund, if no other solution is available).Based on our testing, we believe the risk that the project fails in a way that we simply do not deliver the product is very low. We are not a big, mature organization, but we have been working on this project for over three years and have spent too much time and money to let it fail.

FAQ's
For product specific FAQ, take a look here.





Why we need your support?



We have fully
functional samples of the Efneo Gearbox that you can see on our movies. They have successfully gone through on-road tests of durability and functionality. We will soon be ready for production.
Though we have big
ambition, we are a small company and only have the capacity to finance limited lots of production, and that elevates our operating capital costs.
You can help us to
increase the volume ordered in a factory so that we can start from an
affordable level of manufacturing costs per unit.
As we mentioned above, the objective of the Indiegogo campaign is not to finance product development process. We have already invested almost four years of our work and over half million USD in this project.
The reason we need your support is to put the biggest possible first order in a factory (and in fact there are more than one factory - the other is for cranks, the other for gears, the other for shifters etc.). Some of them have so called MOQs (Minimum Order Quantity).
To lower our operating capital costs we decided to offer the gearbox on Indiegogo for a much discounted price!
And here you can read this insightful article on Efneo evolution within these years. You can see there photos of prototypes even from 2012 :)
http://www.solidsmack.com/design/the-efneo-cycling-gearbox-project/
Believe me - it costs huge amount of cash and work to make a leap from the garage stage in 2012 to this sleek and clean product that you can see now!
To sum up - we will deliver the gearboxes to the contributors no matter how much we raise on Indiegogo.

Shipment costs
Shipment is FREE for:

United States and Canada
European Union
Australia
Japan
Taiwan


Your shipment will be sent from a local distributor by post. All costs (shipment, taxes, duties) are included in your perk.
This is how people are contributing now - almost half of our contributors are coming from the United States, but there are also people from Germany, UK, Netherlands, Australia, Canada and other places :)




For other countries than mentioned on the list above we need to add shipping costs. If you want to back us, please contact me (email: fm@efneo.com) to let you know, what the cost is and if we can afford covering it.

</div><div> </div></div>","The Cyclotron - The Future of Cycling Production of the first bikes has started!   Please also check the 'Updates' section on our page to see all news!      You won't see anything similar to this from another manufacturer on this planet. After more than 3 years of extensive & highly confidential development and testing, the Cyclotron is the next big step in bicycle evolution. From this point on, regular bicycles will appear like nostalgic collector's items, we believe the Cyclotron is: ""The Future of Cycling"". All areas of our life are progressing and evolving very fast, new inventions appear literally every day, outdating the ones from yesterday. But looking at bicycles, they haven't evolved with nearly comparable speed within the last decades.  That's why we've created the world's most advanced and versatile Smart Bike. The Cyclotron is fully connected, packed with tons of innovative features and controlled by the powerful Cyclo-App. The Features - Revolutionary Design & Unmatched FunctionalityWe believe a bicycle as a ""utility"" that should enable you to reach your goals. Wheather it is to get your groceries, taking your kids to the playground or simply having fun riding it.To handle these different ""tasks"" we made the Cyclotron the most versatile and technically advanced bike available today. During the last years working on the Cyclotron project, we've developed a great number of ideas and solutions that make this bike truly unique. We're currently closer checking on more than 15 patents that we'll plan to file for. The Cyclotron is innovative power at it's best. Spokeless Wheels & Utility SlotsThe Cyclotron is equipped with two spokeless wheels, it is the world's first commercially available bike using this technology.- Space for ""Utility Slots"" within both wheels- Improved aerodynamics (fully integrated brakes)- Airless tires (solid polymer, last +6,000 mi)- Integrated mud guardsInternal E-Gear Box & Encapsulated Drive Train  - Super fast shifts in < 0.2 seconds- Up & Downshifts under load and while standing still- E-Gear Box model with full-auto shift mode- Manual Gear Box model with suggestion for optimal gear selectionIntegrated Smart Lights & Li-Ion BatteryAll lights of the Cyclotron Bike are toggled by the Automatic Light Sensor, that switches them on/off according to the current daylight situation. This tremendously enhances your visibility when riding in traffic or on roads with no public street lighting.   The Self charging Li-Ion Battery Pack powers the Cyclotrons lights for more than 8 hours without engaging the internal dynamo. The Cyclo-App notifies you when battery is low, so you'll never run out of power. The Battery is located inside the seatpost and can easily be removed for additional charging with the optional Cyclo-Charger at any wall socket.Powerful Cyclotron App & Sensors- Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE) Sensors- Real-time cycling data for every ride- In-App Navigation- Track & Train with Cyclo-Coach (*)- Autonomous accident & emergency reporting service (**)- Theft Prevention & GPS Bike Finder (**)When the Sensors encounter signs of an emergency or accident, the Cyclotron App autonomously sends an emergency notification to get you help. ( * = free 1 year subscription with every cyclotron // later regular price: 10€/month, 25€/3months, 80€/year)( ** = optional service: 3€/month, 8€/3months, 25€/year)   The Mission - World's most advanced and versatile Smart BikeThe Cyclotron Bike is it's own small universe, where technology and creative minded people can form a unique experience for every rider. It's an open source Smart Bike Platform, that everybody can connect and contribute to, to improve the Cyclotron Universe with each day.   In order to create the foundation for the ""Cyclo-Verse"" we had to overcome the boundaries of conventional bikes and tear down some walls. This is were we started our work more than 3 years ago. We quickly noticed that the possibilities for improvement were quite limited, when sticking with the ""regular"" bicycle platform. We questioned every aspect of the ""Motion on two wheels"" and investigated the latest high-tech materials and production methods from many other kinds of vehicles, by sea, land & air.Materials and production methods have rapidly evolved within the last decade. Whenever speed & performance is an relevant issue, we always encountered the extensive use of carbon fiber in these constructions. The Frame -  Space Grade Carbon Fiber Monocoque ConstructionThe Cyclotron Bike is made of Space Grade Carbon Fiber Composite, wich makes it rigid, stiff & ultra lightweight at the same time. To achieve a true Space Grade Composite Construction we combined two layers of carbon fiber with an ultra lightweight core structure. This way we can use fewer layers of carbon fiber and less resin, without impairing stability. Advanced aerodynamic frame shapeBut we didn't stop with a light construction. To minimize air resistance, drag & turbulences, we use aerodynamic wing-shaped tube profiles. They literally ""slice"" through the air like a knife, when you go fast. The tube shapes of the Cyclotron frame are a combination of Ultralight Glider Planes with the edgy lines of Stealth Jets. Paired with the advanced carbon fiber frame construction, the Cyclotron is lightyears ahead of any conventional bicycle available today.Frame SizesThe Cyclotron is available in three different frame sizes: S, M, L for you to chose from.When you're right in between two sizes, you can choose weather you like a more agile or comfort oriented bike, by chosing the smaller or larger frame size.Fully Integrated - No Cables, No Wires, No External ComponentsThe Cyclotron is the world's first fully integrated bike. Yes, many other manufacturers claim their bicycles also to be fully integrated, but they can't manage to integrate the drivetrain components, like the chain and derailleur into the frame.   With the groundbreaking construction of the Cyclotron we managed to integrate literally everything. All wires and cables run inside the frame, which also results in tremendous enhanced aerodynamics, no more dirt exposure and a clean and uncluttered overall look. NO brake cables, No shifting cables, No light cables. World's first truly ""Fully Integrated Design"" We even managed to integrate the modified caliper brakes to be completely concealed within the hubless wheel housing, but still being accessible for ease of maintenance. One Bike - Two Riding StylesThe Cyclotron Bike features two different riding styles. SPORT - A very streamlined and low-profile one for optimal speed and performance. COMFORT - A more relaxed and upright one for cruising and better comfort. This gives you the choice of two different bicycles to pick from at any time. Just two small adjustments change the entire seating geometry of your Cyclotron bike. Just flip the bars and lower the seating height! It's really that easy.Team up with your friends & fellow riders, and connect your bikes to an ""Articulated Tandem""  THE USM's - Utility Slot Modules One of the big advantages of the Cyclotron's hubless wheels is the usable space that they offer. Instead of having just ""swirled air"" between your wheels, you can add different USM's (Utility Slot Modules) to your bike. The USM's are tool-less attached to the inside of your front or back wheel within seconds.The Utility Modules can securely be locked inside the hubless wheel, when not needed, you can easily store them away, so you're not riding around with some unnecessary weight on your Cyclotron. From the launch you can choose from four USM's. Within our Stretch Goals three more modules can be unlocked. You can order multiple modules together with your Cyclotron Bike by simply adding the amount to your pledge.These USM's (Utility Slot Modules) are available for the Kickstarter launch:The Polygon Basket - The simplest way to add stowage (+ 49 €)The polygon basket is made from composite fiber and is both: lightweight and durable. The dimensions are perfectly balanced, so you'll have a maximum space for stowage without getting too heavy when fully loaded. The Polygon Basket - Versatile stowage basket for your Cyclotron. Within one Polygon Basket you'll get enough space so stow two large grocery bags or two 6-packs of water. If you mount them in both wheels it equals 24(!) bottles of water, and you still have some space left in between.The Butterfly Basket - The most elegant stowage that can fold away (+ 89 €)Like the Polygon basket the Butterfly Basket is also light and durable. The amazing feature is, that it can be completely folded away, to a slim disk of just 2cm thickness when not needed. Butterfly Basket with flexible mesh on back and front. The Wingman - Innovative child seat system (+ 399 €)The Wingman is a groundbreaking child seat system that is fixed to the back wheel of the Cyclotron. You can choose weather you like to mount it on the left, the right or even on both sides of the Bike.When your children are still too young to pedal for themselves, it has always been a problem taking them with you for a ride. As most of the Cyclotron team has kids, they encounter this problem, too.  The ""easy-to-attach-quickly-removed"" solutions are often insecure & sketchy and don't give you the confidence of having your child safely secured. On the other hand, safe and properly attached seats require a lot of time to mount and can't be removed easily when not needed. In most cases they're also quite heavy, bulky and hard to stow away when space is limited.   You can mount the Wingman seat on both sides of the Cyclotron The Wingman Seat will come with independent safety test certificate, comparable to European ""GS"" and ""TÜV"", to ensure it meets the highest safety standards.  The seat is adjustable so it can fit your child from the age of  2-8 years. Underneath the seat there is a large additional stowage space, that compensates for not being able to put any Basket USM inside the back wheel, while having the Wingman attached to your Bike.There there are many more modules to come after we shipped your Kickstarter orders. We've already gathered tons of ideas for a lot of cool & practical USM's, and we hope that also the Cyclotron Community will come up with amazing ideas themselves.The USM Maker Store - Create your groundbreaking Utility ModulesThe USM Maker Store is a place where you let your ideas for revolutionary USM's come true. Everything is possible, from 3D printed wind power generators to salmon leather messenger bags. You decide wheather to manufacture & ship by yourself, or hand the business to us.We believe, that riders know best what riders need. So we'd like to encourage the whole community to develop their own ""Utility Slot Modules"" to make the Cyclotron Bike a continuously evolving organism that perfectly adapts to your lifestyle.  If you have a truly great, but yet unfinished concept of your USM, you also could team up with other makers to finish the remaining work together. These small groups can sell their USM's as a ""Maker-Group"" and share the earnings. This is another way, to get your idea in front of the community, too.  The Decals - Individual Vinyl Art Pieces for your Cyclotron BikeWe believe the Cyclotron not just to be a technical revolution of gears and bolts, but also a platform for visual art & creativity. (Decal Sets starting at 49€) The Decals for your Cyclotron Bike are printed on ultra durable outdoor vinyl, so they'll last for years. They're self-adhessive, very easy to apply and removable without any residues. We use the same quality of vinyl, that is used in professional car-wraping and facade advertising.      We'll launch The Decal Creator Store, so everybody can create their very own and individual look for the Cyclotron. You can easily choose an existing design, or create your own throughout the online editor. Just upload your artwork and we'll print & ship your quality vinyl decals in no time.     Vinyl Decals - Unlimited possibilities to individualize your Cyclotron Bike If you like to share your design with the community, you can even sell it within the Creator Store, and make other riders happy. With a few easy steps you can turn your bike into a ""Rolling Art Piece"" that reflects your personal style and is highly individual.The Gear Box - We unchained the BicycleOne of the biggest problems of regular bicycles we solved, is the exposed and vulnerable power transmission from the pedals to the rear wheel via a metal bike chain and gears. The oily chain and gears are mandatory ""collecting"" dust & dirt from the road, which reduces the efficiency of power transmission with every ride.Also the shifting components of a regular Bike, like the derailleur and transmission cables are easy prey for dirt and damage. On a regular bicycle, they have to be serviced, greased & re-adjusted frequently.We choose to equip the Cyclotron with a Sequential Gear Box, that is the latest development for bicycle power transmission available on the market today. That results in NO MORE exposed mechanical components and VERY LITTLE need for maintenance. We recommend changing gear oil only every 10.000km / 6300mi or at least once a year. You don't need to be a bike technician, there are just two screws that need to be removed.We offer the Cyclotron Bike with tree different Gear Box Setups: The shifting process is accomplished by a high precision step motor in less than 0.2 seconds.The paddle shifters operate with the ease of a simple mouse click.    
The Cyclotrons gear box offers up to 18 ""Real Gears"", wich means that they could be used without reducing efficiency. A classic 3x10 derailleur system offers, due to chain skew and overlap, only up to 15 gears. 
 
The Cyclo App - Take Control 
The Cyclotron App syncs seamless with all integrated on-board sensors of your Bike. The data for each ride is displayed in real-time and is automatically being saved to your Cyclo-Log.
But we don't want the Cyclotron App to be ""just a nice display"" on your handle bars, this is why we made it really smart. It continually learns from your habits and adjusts accordingly. 
The App analyzes your rides and after a short learning phase it assists you with: 
- Suggestions for optimal Gear Selection (Mechanical Gear Box)
- Fully Automatic Up- & Downshifts (only with E-Gear)
- Smart Battery Charging & Dynamo automatic engage/disengage
 
The Sensors - Track your rides in real time
Your Cyclotron is loaded with more than 10 Sensors that operate on Bluetooth Smart / LE standard. All relevant cycling data is displayed within the Cyclo-App while you ride, and will automatically be saved for later reviewing or sharing. 
While other people need to spend hundreds of Dollars for aftermarket Sensors, that have to be install with lots of wires & mounts on the exterior of the bike frame, the Cyclotron comes with pre-installed & fully integrated Sensors.

 
The Smart Cyclo-Coach - Get the most out of every ride
Every Backer on Kickstarter receives a 1 year Cyclo Smart Coach subscription for free with his bike. 
If you like to challenge yourself and take your riding abilities to a whole new level, then there is no better way to train than with the Cyclo Smart Coach. Track your rides with the App and master the challenges the coach throws at you. 
The smart coach analyzes your riding abilities and adapts the training to your individual fitness level. At the end of each week you can give the coach a feedback weather the number of workouts and intensity was manageable.
 
The Quality - Warranty & Returns 
We believe in the quality of the Cyclotron, so we're offering our customers an extensive warranty.
- 3 year Warranty
- Lifetime Frame Warranty
- Free replacement in case of theft (*) (**)
- 10 days return (*)
( * = costs for shipping not included)
( ** = mandatory subscription ""Theft Prevention & GPS Bike Finder"")
 
The Demo Days - Test-ride the Cyclotron 
To further ensure that our backers don't need to buy ""a pig in a poke"", we'll host the Cyclotron Demo Days for everyone that likes to test-ride the bike prior to deciding about the frame size, color or wich USM to order.
 
 We understand, that the Cyclotron is a highly innovative bike and can't be compared to anything currently available on the market. 
You'll be able to modify your initial order right on the spot, to make sure you'll be happy with your Cyclotron Bike.
If your test ride will not 100% convince you, we'll refund you on the same day. With no questions asked! (via Paypal)
 
Indiegogo - We want you!
By starting the Cyclotron as an ""Open Source Smart Cycle Platform"", we believe that riders know best what riders need. We like the community to evolve together with the bike and on the other hand, help evolving the Bike with their ideas and creativity.
We've already secured more than 1.5 million Euros in funding, plus our own funds we've put up. This money is for taking on the last technical tweaks on the Bike and the App/Web development. The pledges we collect on Kickstarter are solely used for production of the final Cyclotron Bikes. 
The Cyclotron Platform should work like a perfect ""Cycle"", where the inspiration from riders, makers and creatives merge and create a better experience for everyone. We're also looking forward on hopefully a whole bunch of feedback & inspiration from our backers during and after the campaign. This is why crowdfunding our project on Kickstarter is the perfect way to start.

<p><b>Easy to Ride</b></p>
<p>Leafboard is not only compact and convenient but also very easy to ride. We didn`t go with the traditional deck size and trucks of the freestyle skateboard, but in instead we use a 9.5-inch wide deck (the same width as one of the typical longboards) and 6-inch trucks. </p>
<p>We listen to many skaters when we started the design of Leafboard. So we have a deck with the kick tail to make Leafboard easy to do kick and stop, have the low U concave mold to make it comfortable for long range ride, and have pro longboard bearings, high rebound wheels, and bushing to make it more stable.</p>

Easy to Ride
Leafboard is not only compact and convenient but also very easy to ride. We didn`t go with the traditional deck size and trucks of the freestyle skateboard, but in instead we use a 9.5-inch wide deck (the same width as one of the typical longboards) and 6-inch trucks. 
We listen to many skaters when we started the design of Leafboard. So we have a deck with the kick tail to make Leafboard easy to do kick and stop, have the low U concave mold to make it comfortable for long range ride, and have pro longboard bearings, high rebound wheels, and bushing to make it more stable.

</h1><p><i><br/></i></p><h3>What Is The Wheel Watcher? <br/>
</h3>
<p>The Wheel Watcher® is a fully patented, simple and effective ""hands-on"" device created to prevent distracted driving while positively changing long-term driving habits. One driver at a time, we can make a difference.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/983930/files/20141103183749-Wheel_Watcher.jpg?1415068669"" src="""" style=""""/>3D Print of the Wheel Watcher<br/></p><br/><h3>How does the Wheel Watcher work?</h3>
<p>The Wheel Watcher is a rigid tamper-proof steering wheel cover with sensors in it that automatically activate when the vehicle accelerates over a predetermined speed. Once activated, if a driver removes their hand from the wheel for a 
predetermined amount of time, an alarm will sound  and will continue to 
escalate at intervals, reminding the driver to return their hands to the
 wheel.<br/></p><p>A hinge is located at the top of the Wheel Watcher, and it opens at the bottom. As the device is lowered onto the wheel, the two halves meet at the bottom and lock together requiring a key provided to the vehicle owner, to remove it.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FMK0Da1GHUCQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMK0Da1GHUCQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FMK0Da1GHUCQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p> The second piece to the Wheel Watcher is a small control box that gets plugged into the OBD2 port that's located below the steering wheel in the dash of a vehicle. The OBD2 port is on all vehicles manufactured since 1996. Once a vehicle reaches a predetermined speed, 10 mph for example, the sensors are activated and an alarm will sound if your hand is off the steering wheel for a set time (5 seconds for example). The alarm will continue to grow louder until both hands are returned to the steering wheel firmly (and remain there). The driver has the time to engage the logical features of a car 
(shifting, adjusting the heat etc.) but not enough time to text, hold a cellphone, eat a sandwich, apply makeup, or do any of the number of things that create a distracted driver, without setting off the alarm.  </p><p>The Wheel Watcher also records usage data for the vehicle owner. Data includes the date/time the alarm is set off, the length of time it took for the driver to return both hands to the wheel and whether the left or right hand set it off. The data is tracked over time to monitor improvements and trends. This information can then be downloaded by the vehicle owner (a parent, rental 
agency, insurance provider,employer etc.) at 
any time.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/396907/files/20140226140815-sensorsfromtechsheet.png?1393452495"" src="""" style=""""/>Sensors on one of the earlier versions of the Wheel Watcher prototype<br/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><h3>How Did The Wheel Watcher Come to Be?</h3>
<p>One day, while a passenger on a bus during rush hour traffic in 
Boston, MA Bill witnessed an accident caused by a driver that was 
texting while driving. The accident happened quickly but the experience 
stayed with Bill and eventually
 it led him to design and patent the first prototype of the Wheel 
Watcher in his garage. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/980807/files/20141102190215-IMG_0262.JPG?1414983735"" src="""" style=""""/>Original garage-built Wheel Watcher on a breadboard</p><p>We
 then partnered with the Advanced Technology &amp; Manufacturing Center 
at UMASS Dartmouth to build us our second prototype. Their state of the 
art technology facility brought us even closer to our vision. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/980830/files/20141102191037-IMG_0261.JPG?1414984237"" src="""" style=""""/>2nd Wheel Watcher prototype built by ATMC at UMASS Dartmouth</p>This second, functional prototype of the Wheel Watcher is what you see in our
 photos and videos thus far. It’s our baby, made from blood, sweat, 
tears and determination and it’s gotten us where we are today. <br/><br/>We think the Wheel Watcher device can follow a path similar to the seat 
belt. Wheel Watcher may seem like a big adjustment at first, but the benefits far outweigh the unease of using something new. While seat belt usage was only 15% or so back in the 80s, usage is
 at 83% in 2013, it's second nature. The real power of the Wheel Watcher is that its helping you constantly. Where the seat belt uses an alarm when you first start driving, it gives up on you after a
 few beeps, and the Wheel Watcher won't. Our device tracks your hands 
every time you're behind the wheel, the entire time you're driving. Over time
 the Wheel Watcher conditions the driver to keep both hands on the 
wheel, thus improving long-term driving habits and greatly reducing 
driving distractions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Who Will Benefit from Wheel Watcher?</h3><div>We hope you see the massive potential of our product to prevent needless deaths and injuries, while simultaneously changing the habits of drivers everywhere. Just think if we could even just get a Wheel Watcher for every teen driver! Our roads would be safer and we could solidify positive driving behavior when teens are first forming their driving habits. But the Wheel Watcher isn't just for teens, distracted driving knows no bounds. We are ALL addicted to our devices and multitasking.  Where we see huge potential for early adoption is with:<br/>

<h3>Where Do the Funds Go </h3>
<p>Your contributions will be used to manufacture two final Wheel Watcher devices prior to production and distribution. These units will include the features and functionality we expect to deliver in the first generation Wheel Watcher. Having two new sales-ready units (instead of one) will allow us to keep one unit for demonstrations and testing, while releasing the second unit for independent testing to help us move through to manufacturing and distribution faster. The funds will be allocated to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Final tooling for the latch that makes the Wheel Watcher tamper-proof.</li>
<li>The addition of four more sensors, one each at the top and bottom of each side on the steering wheel as a result of user feedback during product testing.</li>
<li>Mold Fabrication for the production-ready first generation Wheel Watcher.</li>
<li>Design and manufacturing of 2 Wheel Watchers<br/>
</li>
<li>Patent &amp; legal fees. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Your Contribution Is Important</h3>
<p>3,331 people were killed in accidents involving distracted driving in 2011 alone. Another 387,000 people were injured in accidents involving distracted driving in the same year. Whether or not you intend personally purchase a Wheel Watcher in the future, your contribution today supports the united campaign to prevent distracted driving and save lives. Your contribution combined with that of your peers will show the world that we support a solution that focuses on <b><i>preventing</i></b> accidents and changing driver behavior, not just focusing on technology that responds during and after an accident happens. </p>
<h3>Spread The Word</h3>
<p>We don't just need your contribution though, we need your voice! We hope you come to believe in this product as strongly as we do.  The Wheel Watcher is the “hands-on solution to prevent distracted driving” and we can’t wait to see one in every car in America.</p>
<p>Please show your support and stand behind the movement to end distracted driving by sharing our campaign far and frequently with your friends and family on all social networks using the Indigogo share tools. </p>
<p>With your monetary and social support we can bring the Wheel Watcher to market and start saving lives, as we prevent distracted driving one vehicle at a time. </p>
<h3><b>Q&amp;A</b></h3>
<p><b><b>Is the Wheel Watcher easy to install? </b></b></p>
<p>Yes, it's incredibly easy. Simply lower the cover onto the steering wheel and secure it with the latch and key. Then locate the OBD2 port on your dash (peak under your steering wheel next time you get in, you'll see it), and insert the control box by simply pushing it in until it clicks. Easy peasy!</p>
<p><b><b>Can this device be removed (say by my teen)? </b></b></p>
<p>No, it really is meant to be tamper-proof. We purposely made it a solid shell rather than a soft cover so that it could not be removed. It's meant to stay on your wheel long term. The latch and key hold it securely in place. </p>
<p><b><b>What if I lose the key?</b></b></p>
<p>Contact Wheel Watcher, verify that you are the owner of the device, and we'll send you another. </p>
<p><b><b>How <i>exactly</i> does the Wheel Watcher work?</b></b></p>
<p>The steering wheel cover has 2 kinds of sensors in it as well as a battery and a small transmission box (Zigbee tx/rx) at the bottom,  that points toward the floor of the car. The transmission box collects the signals from the sensors in the wheel and transmits it to the control box that's in the OBD2 slot below your dash.  The control box has another zigbee to collect and record the data. The control box runs off 12V of power pulled from the car. There are two logs in it that each collect 60 seconds of data over and over. They stagger at 50 seconds so that there are always 10 seconds of data overlapping and never a gap in recording. The control box also houses the alarm speaker and a USB port to extract the data to your personal device. Pretty neat stuff right?</p>
<p><b><b>Will the Wheel Watcher really be white and have words on it?</b></b></p>
<p>Nope. We want the prototype to stand out, but the sold units will be much less obvious. They won't include the Wheel Watcher name across the top or Drive With Two Hands on the bottom. We haven't determined the color(s) yet and will be reaching out to our contributors for input, so make sure you contribute to have your voice heard!</p>
<p><b><b>Will the data synch via bluetooth on my smartphone?</b></b></p>
<p>Not at this time. That would be a stretch goal we'd love to add should we exceed our initial campaign ask, but at this time data will be downloaded by connecting a USB to the control box and a computer, or tablet to upload data from the Wheel Watcher.</p>
<p><b><b>I'm interested in Wheel Watcher for my business, can I get customized reports by employee? </b></b></p>
<p>Fantastic! We know this is going to be a popular request and are already working through that possibility. At this time we believe that would be an add on feature that we'd work out with you prior to delivery of your Wheel Watchers.</p>
<p><b><b>When will I be able to order the Wheel Watcher?</b></b></p>
<p>Our goal is June 2015, and is dependent upon the success of this campaign so please make a contribution and share this with your friends!</p>
<b>How much will the Wheel Watcher cost?</b>
</div><div>We don't have the exact price set, it will depend upon these last adjustments to the device and our first production run. We feel confident saying it will be around $250.</div><h3>Wheel Watcher Accolades</h3>

predetermined amount of time, an alarm will sound  and will continue to 
escalate at intervals, reminding the driver to return their hands to the
 wheel.A hinge is located at the top of the Wheel Watcher, and it opens at the bottom. As the device is lowered onto the wheel, the two halves meet at the bottom and lock together requiring a key provided to the vehicle owner, to remove it.

 The second piece to the Wheel Watcher is a small control box that gets plugged into the OBD2 port that's located below the steering wheel in the dash of a vehicle. The OBD2 port is on all vehicles manufactured since 1996. Once a vehicle reaches a predetermined speed, 10 mph for example, the sensors are activated and an alarm will sound if your hand is off the steering wheel for a set time (5 seconds for example). The alarm will continue to grow louder until both hands are returned to the steering wheel firmly (and remain there). The driver has the time to engage the logical features of a car 
(shifting, adjusting the heat etc.) but not enough time to text, hold a cellphone, eat a sandwich, apply makeup, or do any of the number of things that create a distracted driver, without setting off the alarm.  The Wheel Watcher also records usage data for the vehicle owner. Data includes the date/time the alarm is set off, the length of time it took for the driver to return both hands to the wheel and whether the left or right hand set it off. The data is tracked over time to monitor improvements and trends. This information can then be downloaded by the vehicle owner (a parent, rental 
agency, insurance provider,employer etc.) at 
any time.Sensors on one of the earlier versions of the Wheel Watcher prototype
How Did The Wheel Watcher Come to Be?
One day, while a passenger on a bus during rush hour traffic in 
Boston, MA Bill witnessed an accident caused by a driver that was 
texting while driving. The accident happened quickly but the experience 
stayed with Bill and eventually
 it led him to design and patent the first prototype of the Wheel 
Watcher in his garage. Original garage-built Wheel Watcher on a breadboardWe
 then partnered with the Advanced Technology & Manufacturing Center 
at UMASS Dartmouth to build us our second prototype. Their state of the 
art technology facility brought us even closer to our vision. 2nd Wheel Watcher prototype built by ATMC at UMASS DartmouthThis second, functional prototype of the Wheel Watcher is what you see in our
 photos and videos thus far. It’s our baby, made from blood, sweat, 
tears and determination and it’s gotten us where we are today. We think the Wheel Watcher device can follow a path similar to the seat 
belt. Wheel Watcher may seem like a big adjustment at first, but the benefits far outweigh the unease of using something new. While seat belt usage was only 15% or so back in the 80s, usage is
 at 83% in 2013, it's second nature. The real power of the Wheel Watcher is that its helping you constantly. Where the seat belt uses an alarm when you first start driving, it gives up on you after a
 few beeps, and the Wheel Watcher won't. Our device tracks your hands 
every time you're behind the wheel, the entire time you're driving. Over time
 the Wheel Watcher conditions the driver to keep both hands on the 
wheel, thus improving long-term driving habits and greatly reducing 
driving distractions.Who Will Benefit from Wheel Watcher?We hope you see the massive potential of our product to prevent needless deaths and injuries, while simultaneously changing the habits of drivers everywhere. Just think if we could even just get a Wheel Watcher for every teen driver! Our roads would be safer and we could solidify positive driving behavior when teens are first forming their driving habits. But the Wheel Watcher isn't just for teens, distracted driving knows no bounds. We are ALL addicted to our devices and multitasking.  Where we see huge potential for early adoption is with:



Parents

Teens
Insurance Companies
Driving Schools
Employers with company vehicles
Government Vehicles
Mass Transit Vehicles
Commercial Motor Vehicle drivers

Where Do the Funds Go 
Your contributions will be used to manufacture two final Wheel Watcher devices prior to production and distribution. These units will include the features and functionality we expect to deliver in the first generation Wheel Watcher. Having two new sales-ready units (instead of one) will allow us to keep one unit for demonstrations and testing, while releasing the second unit for independent testing to help us move through to manufacturing and distribution faster. The funds will be allocated to: 

Final tooling for the latch that makes the Wheel Watcher tamper-proof.
The addition of four more sensors, one each at the top and bottom of each side on the steering wheel as a result of user feedback during product testing.
Mold Fabrication for the production-ready first generation Wheel Watcher.
Design and manufacturing of 2 Wheel Watchers

Patent & legal fees. 

Why Your Contribution Is Important
3,331 people were killed in accidents involving distracted driving in 2011 alone. Another 387,000 people were injured in accidents involving distracted driving in the same year. Whether or not you intend personally purchase a Wheel Watcher in the future, your contribution today supports the united campaign to prevent distracted driving and save lives. Your contribution combined with that of your peers will show the world that we support a solution that focuses on preventing accidents and changing driver behavior, not just focusing on technology that responds during and after an accident happens. 
Spread The Word
We don't just need your contribution though, we need your voice! We hope you come to believe in this product as strongly as we do.  The Wheel Watcher is the “hands-on solution to prevent distracted driving” and we can’t wait to see one in every car in America.
Please show your support and stand behind the movement to end distracted driving by sharing our campaign far and frequently with your friends and family on all social networks using the Indigogo share tools. 
With your monetary and social support we can bring the Wheel Watcher to market and start saving lives, as we prevent distracted driving one vehicle at a time. 
Q&A
Is the Wheel Watcher easy to install? 
Yes, it's incredibly easy. Simply lower the cover onto the steering wheel and secure it with the latch and key. Then locate the OBD2 port on your dash (peak under your steering wheel next time you get in, you'll see it), and insert the control box by simply pushing it in until it clicks. Easy peasy!
Can this device be removed (say by my teen)? 
No, it really is meant to be tamper-proof. We purposely made it a solid shell rather than a soft cover so that it could not be removed. It's meant to stay on your wheel long term. The latch and key hold it securely in place. 
What if I lose the key?
Contact Wheel Watcher, verify that you are the owner of the device, and we'll send you another. 
How exactly does the Wheel Watcher work?
The steering wheel cover has 2 kinds of sensors in it as well as a battery and a small transmission box (Zigbee tx/rx) at the bottom,  that points toward the floor of the car. The transmission box collects the signals from the sensors in the wheel and transmits it to the control box that's in the OBD2 slot below your dash.  The control box has another zigbee to collect and record the data. The control box runs off 12V of power pulled from the car. There are two logs in it that each collect 60 seconds of data over and over. They stagger at 50 seconds so that there are always 10 seconds of data overlapping and never a gap in recording. The control box also houses the alarm speaker and a USB port to extract the data to your personal device. Pretty neat stuff right?
Will the Wheel Watcher really be white and have words on it?
Nope. We want the prototype to stand out, but the sold units will be much less obvious. They won't include the Wheel Watcher name across the top or Drive With Two Hands on the bottom. We haven't determined the color(s) yet and will be reaching out to our contributors for input, so make sure you contribute to have your voice heard!
Will the data synch via bluetooth on my smartphone?
Not at this time. That would be a stretch goal we'd love to add should we exceed our initial campaign ask, but at this time data will be downloaded by connecting a USB to the control box and a computer, or tablet to upload data from the Wheel Watcher.
I'm interested in Wheel Watcher for my business, can I get customized reports by employee? 
Fantastic! We know this is going to be a popular request and are already working through that possibility. At this time we believe that would be an add on feature that we'd work out with you prior to delivery of your Wheel Watchers.
When will I be able to order the Wheel Watcher?
Our goal is June 2015, and is dependent upon the success of this campaign so please make a contribution and share this with your friends!
How much will the Wheel Watcher cost?
We don't have the exact price set, it will depend upon these last adjustments to the device and our first production run. We feel confident saying it will be around $250.Wheel Watcher Accolades

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE GAS STORY</strong></h2>
<p align=""left"">In June 2010 I became intrigued with the trucking industry, considering that the auto industry everywhere was making great strides in technology and design. Deeply interested in what the industry was doing I learned that a variety of things were being accomplished with the help of the <strong>Federal Super Truck Programs</strong> to improve the fuel efficiency of large vehicles, especially Heavy Duty Class 8 tractor-trailers trucks, better known as semis.</p>
<p align=""left"">There were improvement in tractor design, diesel engines, power systems, drive trains, tire technology, and overall aerodynamic potential on these large box-shaped vehicles wherever they could. One area of concern with the subject of aerodynamics caught my attention — the Base.</p>

<p align=""left"">Looking at studies going back to the 50s, it is agreed that on Class 8 semi-trucks there are 4 major areas that contribute to the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle. Included are the front of the tractor, the area between the tractor and trailer where it articulates, the area under the trailer, and the Base, which is the area at the very back end where all the displaced air comes back together in an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the <strong>Trailing Vortex</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","I’m Ken Harper, from Mountain View, CA here to tell you about the game-changing Genesis Aerodynamic System – a classic example of American Ingenuity.
What It Does

Improves safety and stability
Reduces greenhouse gas emissions
Increases fuel efficiency and lowers fuel cost
Generates growth in several sectors of the economy


KEY FEATURES

 Durable modular construction, self-powered, fully automatic, weatherproof, low-maintenance.
Top-mounted array of deflector panels regulate airflow around the back of a vehicle to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency.
Built-in sensors detect surrounding conditions, CPU converts data into command signals interfacing with robotics controller to extend and swivel the deflectors in real time.




THE GAS STORY
In June 2010 I became intrigued with the trucking industry, considering that the auto industry everywhere was making great strides in technology and design. Deeply interested in what the industry was doing I learned that a variety of things were being accomplished with the help of the Federal Super Truck Programs to improve the fuel efficiency of large vehicles, especially Heavy Duty Class 8 tractor-trailers trucks, better known as semis.
There were improvement in tractor design, diesel engines, power systems, drive trains, tire technology, and overall aerodynamic potential on these large box-shaped vehicles wherever they could. One area of concern with the subject of aerodynamics caught my attention — the Base.

Looking at studies going back to the 50s, it is agreed that on Class 8 semi-trucks there are 4 major areas that contribute to the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle. Included are the front of the tractor, the area between the tractor and trailer where it articulates, the area under the trailer, and the Base, which is the area at the very back end where all the displaced air comes back together in an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the Trailing Vortex.

The most viable products designed to address the trailing vortex were called Trailer Extension Panels (TEP).  This tail-piece attachment was adopted for the base on the Super Truck, a new prototype vehicle developed within the Super Truck Program. With all the combined improvements this new truck would reach over 12 mpg, twice the average mileage of most semis on the road today.
Examples of Conventional Trailer Extension Panels:

The TEP  helped but it had severe limitations including:

Invariable function, non- adjustable to real world driving conditions
Bulky, awkward, and cumbersome, flimsy construction subject to damage
Use limited to a small fraction of the tens of millions of large trucks on the road today

Some other variations of drag reduction accessories:

The Solution
Scaled-down models of the Genesis Aerodynamic System:


The GAS is a standardized modular design — compatible with all large vehicles.
GAS technology can also be applied to other modes of transportation.


We can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem
We all rely on trucks to deliver everything we buy, so we are all part of the problem. The cumulative effect of many years of consumption multiplied by millions of consumers presents a moral imperative. Since this mass commerce culture in essence crowdfunded the climate change crisis, this campaign intends to reverse that trend and crowdfund a solution.

</div></div>","Our Story 

Our
plan is to Manufacture and Deliver minimum of 100 Cargo Lifter Cradle Units.
These lifter cradles can be attached to existing popular drones 3DR IRIS, DJI
Phantom 1, 2, and 3’s. Not to mention that it cannot be adapted to other makes
and models.This
project will provide us enough capital to design and build two Industrial
Strength 25kg (33lb) Agile Flex-I Lifters for Cargo, and Lifeguard
Applications.
If
the contributions surpass our expectations, it will be spent on application
development as outlined on our website: http://agiledrones.com Ian Cardoza, and I (Harjit Sethi), we have designed, built and tested numerous drones. With our combined 40+ background in Aerospace and Telecommunication Engineering, we thought to Design and Manufacture our own Drone which can carry out most of the Industrial and Commercial Applications under the FAA Drone law. But before we undertook that, we decided to test out applications including this one using existing drones. Our websites lists in details our proposed undertakings. Ian Cardoza, Telecommunication Engineer Harjit Sethi, Aerospace, Production EngineerHistory 
It
all started from KICKSTARTER’S “OpenGrab hardware Electro-Permanent cargo
gripper” project by Andreas Jochum in December, 2012 in the Technology Section.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/412473553/opengrab-open-hardware-electro-permanent-cargo-gri/description
The
above item also appeared on DIYDRONES blogs: 
http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/electro-permanent-magnet-for-reliable-cargo-lifting-on-a-quad?xg_source=activityCurrent Situation
Concept
of magnetic power and material handling is not new, but the technology for
picking up and delivering materials using drones is. This idea has been
recently floated on various forums and blogs including the inventor Andreas
Jochum with its potential application. We have been in touch with him
throughout our prototype build up, and hopefully continue to work with him.
While
doing this project, we thought of introducing new ideas in the market place-
1. 
Standardization of Cargo Boxes
2. 
Areas- designated size and location of
containments for pick-up and delivery.
3. 
Possible redundant cargo latching or
securing
4. 
Spur an open source competition on the
above subjects
5. 
Provide practical solutions to the
regulatory agencies.Purpose
of the Project 
We have tried to address some of the above points
with the following design.
1.  Rigid Lifting Cradle
2.  Tough Cargo Box
3.  Maintain FPV Visuals from Ground
Station
4.  Safer Landing/ Lifting Areas
Eliminate Human Intervention attaching/removing
the hardware

We
intend to provide hook up instructions for both models, which may be extended to
other makes and models.
The

Since,
3DRobotics IRIS will exceed its lifting capacity, we replaced the gimbal and
the Hero’s GoPro camera, and replaced it with a small Sony Camera to the lifter
plate looking straight down aiming to find the cargo platform.

</div><p> </p></div>","We believe we can change the world by changing the way we drive and GOFAR does this beautifully.- Intuitive feedback keeps you in your car's efficiency sweet-spot.- Complete driving log.  Great for tax and expenses.- Monitor your car's health from your phone.      EVERYONE LOVES GOFAR Considered one of the top 10 coolest thing in the world by GQ, we've already produced over 3,500 high quality GOFAR devices and shipped to 37 countries around the world.  In fact GOFAR devices have covered over two million kilometres in the last few months, with great feedback from the press.      GREAT CUSTOMER FEEDBACK TOO  GOFAR - KNOWLEDGE IS POWER! Cars are our most expensive cost after a house and groceries, yet most of us have little or no information on our driving.  Knowledge is power though, so with GOFAR you're in control.   You can track fuel costs adding up, how much time different routes take, when to leave for work, average speeds, braking and acceleration scores and more.  It's great for logging expenses too.    FUEL IS MONEY - DON'T WASTE EITHER. Most governments estimate we waste 20-25% of the fuel we pay for through inefficient driving styles.  It's not much on one trip but over a month, a year, a lifetime, why burn literally thousands of dollars if you don't need to? GOFAR logs all your car's driving and makes you the expert.   And in urban and suburban trials it's been shown to save over 20% on fuel costs without increasing journey time - that sounds like free money!   STAY SAFE.  NO STRESS. And whether you're a lumberjack or an accountant, driving to work is probably one of the most dangerous and stressful things you do. Driving with GOFAR keeps things calmer in the car.  Harsh braking and aggressive acceleration are considered risky driving behaviours by insurance companies but tests show driving with GOFAR reduces harsh braking by 25%.    WHO IS GOFAR FOR? 

Driving TO work - make your commute calmer and cheaper

Driving FOR work - never miss out on expenses with GOFAR

Learners - enjoy consistent, objective feedback and score each drive

Parents - help learners learn the right habits right from the start.

Data hounds - explore and optimise your driving

Eco enthusiasts - cut emissions down whilst you save for a Tesla!

Fleets - it's nice to save on one car but it's great to save on lots. 
  THE SCIENCE BEHIND GOFAR Every engine speed has a sweet spot - an optimum position that maximises your power and minimises your fuel consumption. It's where your car runs best. Driving in the sweet spot saves fuel - which saves money and cuts emissions. But unless you are part of a Formula 1 race team it’s difficult to find.  This is where GOFAR helps. 

 
 
  
 
GETTING GOFAR IN YOUR CAR IS EASY GOFAR is compatible with all petrol, hybrid and diesel cars built since 2006.  These cars have an ""OBD-II data port"" which hides away under the steering wheel.  It's a treasure trove of data and GOFAR just plugs into that.  Simple. **If your car was made between 1996 and 2006 it might still be compatible too - we will personally check your car's compatibility - try our fast online assesment.
We guarantee compatibility or your money back if you complete our online check and we tell you your car is compatible.


GOFAR.  GO GREEN.
 GOFAR monitors gasoline flow rate and combustion conditions and calculates emissions for every trip, making your emissions visible.  Adapting your driving behaviour has the best and quickest pay off of anything you can do to reduce emissions and GOFAR's real-time feedback makes this easy. 
 
HOW GOOD IS YOUR DRIVING? 82% of drivers think they are above average! Now with GOFAR, you can prove you’re the best.  Get scores for braking and acceleration on every trip.  Compete in leagues for your make and model, challenge friends, or just beat your personal best. 

 



MULTI-AWARD WINNING DESIGN In May 2016 we were awarded a prestigious Good Design Award winning alongside industry giants such as Oculus Rift, Microsoft and Google.  It's our fifth major award (and shows you don't always need massive budgets to make an impact with thoughtful, effective design).
 
  
We’ve put a lot of thought into the design, exploring hundreds of possibilities, so that GOFAR can work effectively and safely in your peripheral vision with a low cognitive load.

OUR STORYGOFAR started in Sydney, Australia when our rocket-scientist founder, Danny, realised how real-time feedback on his driving changed and improved his driving style cutting his emissions (and in turn saving him money). It's the same principle that racing teams use to improve car efficiency but Danny set out to make a beautiful and affordable version for every car. The team now comes from every corner of the world including Poland, Brazil, Vietnam, India, UK, China, Finland, Israel and of course USA and Australia and we're all dedicated to making driving cheaper, greener, safer and more fun. We have worked at 3M, GE, Nestle and IBM and amongst the team we have an aerospace engineer who was selected as one of two Australians to attend NASA space camp, a data scientist who got the second highest score in India’s national Maths Olympiad, an Oxford graduate, a budding lawyer who came in the top 0.01% in the country and a design guru who also has a 1st in Mechatronic Engineering.

Hello! I'm Lisa Nelson and on March 2, 2014, I
intend to marry Steel Spokes, my beloved bicycle! 
We’ve been together for over 15 years now we are going to make it
official AND depart for 6 months on our “Bicycling Honeymoon” to
accomplish a variety of ambitious goals that lead to even bigger dreams!  
You will be helping
to fund our “Bicycling Honeymoon.”  The
goal is to create, connect, and build community while on bicycle over the
course of six months.  The ultimate dream is to launch a university program, *Semester on Cycle.   In order to do so, I shall reduce my already shoestring budget, and attempt to finish my degree, and test a bunch of stuff from the road.  This is all about “getting by [a ride] with a little help from your friends” as the song goes.  Can it be done?  We think so!  We have lots to get done!  The specific goals are listed below.My darling husband and I shall begin by
riding down the coast of California, and let fate take its course as to our particular destinations…the world is
our oyster (and I like oysters)!  I have
my passport charged up!   What We Need & What You Gets

 Your generous funds shall go towards getting my beloved
Steel Spoke (bicycle) set up for the expedition, and purchasing camping gear
and clothing items (primarily used) that we still need.  Some minor technical
website modifications need to be made.  Also,
funds will help support my darling and I, and the various projects that we intend
to experiment with, on the road for the next 4-6 months.  Our goal is to raise $6000.  The length of the “honeymoon” will depend
upon whether our funding goal is met.  

Any money received beyond our funding goal will go towards a
scholarship to fund economically disadvantaged students on the *Semester on Cycle program!  If by chance Semester on Cycle does not happen, the money will be publically
donated to an inspired cycling program(s). 
I promise!
In return, you will receive one-of-a-kind perks related to the adventure.  From live virtual participation in ""Spokes Interview Unique Folks"" talk show to original art work, we have unique fun gifts to offer at every support level. 
You will not be
funding the wedding!  Our Hawaiian-themed
bicycle wedding will be a simple, inexpensive, wacky little affair –but we will
take lots of photos and film it to share with everyone.  Nor will you be funding hotels or fine dining.  We intend to camp, Couch Surf, and stay with
old and new friends along the way.  Our budget is $20 a day for lodging and
food.  Anything fancier than that will
only be by way of kind donations along the way.  
The ImpactThe goal is to accomplish all of the goals below so as to be
in an opportune place to launch the **“Semester on Cycle” program.  People who are already interested in
the world around them seek out good resources in a community.
 Unfortunately, those who most need to be inspired, encouraged, and
connected to resources are the least likely to know about and take advantage of
the resources around them.  That is why I am aiming to ultimately create a
model Semester on Cycle program, that can be initiated, launched, and
travel to where it is needed most.  Passion Begets Passion!
**Semester on
Cycle is a proposed model
university education program that not only provides an exceptional experience
for the cycling participants, but also offers effective methods of connecting
with community members and assisting people in need (Read more details at:
http://questforzest.org/mission/). Here are some of the specific goals of our
“Honeymoon”:

 Experiment with collaborative art and
music projects.


 Connect with community and people
through service.


Test bike and camping equipment and
gear .


 Complete the “Semester on Cycle”
program model & work out kinks.


Connect with people via a blog and
other online media to share our “Honeymoon” experience.


 Finish writing my (Lisa) dissertation for my Ph.D.
in Higher Education Administration (this way I’ve got the goofy credentials
universities seem to want to teach students and take them on impactful
excursions in the US & throughout the world).


 Advance my Spanish language skills.


Complete an educational “Service
Learning” book I (Lisa) started.


Why together, Steel & I can pull this off!
Believe it or not, all of these plans
are a serious culmination of my personal and professional experiences, and
there is a dreamy, but practical, end goal in mind.  I have had the good fortune to work with
students from high school (delinquent to privileged youth) to college age
leading adventure and service experiences in the United States and abroad for a
non-profit organization, for-profit tour companies, and through a university. 
I am no spring chicken!  I spent 15 years in the non-profit and legal world
working with troubled families and children. 
After years of feeling like I was simply putting Band-Aids on
problems, I shifted gears to go into an academic setting in the hopes of
working with students to find real world solutions to some major problems that
plague disadvantaged communities throughout the U.S.  Also, I am not new to bicycle touring.  I just have not done it in any a major way in
over 15 years.  The last time I led a
group of students on bicycles was pre-internet, pre-cell phone, pre-GPS,
pre-portable computer…and certainly pre-solar and bike-generator power potential.  Holy! I know I can figure it out.  I just need the opportunity to experiment,
finish my writing, and share what I learn to others.  
Why cycling?
As a
young adult, I never rode a bike more than 5 miles nor grew up playing any sort
of sports.  I started riding a bike
through working at an exceptional non-profit program that focused on turning
delinquent youth on to positive programing…such as biking. It turned not only
the kids, but me, on to bicycling.  I think travel on bicycle is the perfect
speed to take in surroundings.  It’s “green” and good for our carbon
footprint.  Plus, it is great exercise,
presents unique challenges, and inevitably provides a memorable adventure.  Most anyone can ride a bike, and if I can
cycle long distances…I know that anyone can!  
Why music, arts and service? 
I
believe that the success of Semester on
Cycle will be dependent upon how quickly and effectively the student participants
can connect and develop a level of trust with the people in the communities
that are visited.  Interactive music, art
and service projects are all effective ways to connect with people, and share
an experience and create a moment –regardless of your economic mean, color,
education, age, sex, sexual preference, or heritage.Other Ways You Can HelpI understand that not everyone is in a great financial spot to help us with such a project.  So besides money, here's some other ways you could help:

<h3>New Materials For Space Exploration</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590471236/kwrfwp3qwqcr8wqts9qo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Picture: simulated cosmic rays hitting earth's atmosphere</i></p>
<p>Radiation is the most dangerous aspect of space travel. Humanity is actively returning to space:<br/>A moon mission, a journey to Mars, a space gateway, … Becoming a multi-planetary species requires technologies that are not available today. New materials technologies are needed to shield spacecraft's from cosmic radiations. </p>
<p>We research applications for space, air and earth-based systems that are sensitive to radiation.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Picture: conceptual representation of a possible research outcome</i></p>
<p>Our materials research falls into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement of computational models.  </li>
<li>Development of multifunctional material properties for use in system optimization procedures.  </li>
<li>Design of optimum radiation protective materials to finish out deficiencies in the shield design at minimum mass and costs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our R&amp;D Approach</h3>
<p>The development of earth independence will extend human presence beyond low Earth orbit and cislunar space and onto Mars. The radiation exposures in deep space are largely from galactic cosmic rays or GCR. Among the types of radiation, the high energies associated with GCR have the most important biological effects.</p>
<p>Today, no effective direct ionizing radiation shielding is designed or implemented on the most advanced human spacecraft for deep-space missions. New technologies need being developed to increase crew mission duration in the space radiation environment. </p>
<p>Particularly, which novel advanced research methods can be applied to design and manufacture advanced materials or combination of materials to lower the radiation level, inside a spacecraft, down to a level known “as low as reasonably achievable”?<br/><br/><a href=""mailto:crowdfunding@emtdlab.com?subject=SRPT%20-%20I%20would%20like%20to%20know%20more%20about%20your%20R%26D%20Approach&amp;body=Dear%20Cedric%2C%0A%0ACan%20you%20tell%20me%20more%20about%20the%20following%3A%0A%0AR%26D%20question%3A%20%0A%0AThank%20you"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reach out to learn more about our approach</a></p>

</div></div>","New Materials For Space Exploration

Picture: simulated cosmic rays hitting earth's atmosphere
Radiation is the most dangerous aspect of space travel. Humanity is actively returning to space:A moon mission, a journey to Mars, a space gateway, … Becoming a multi-planetary species requires technologies that are not available today. New materials technologies are needed to shield spacecraft's from cosmic radiations. 
We research applications for space, air and earth-based systems that are sensitive to radiation.

Picture: conceptual representation of a possible research outcome
Our materials research falls into three categories:

Improvement of computational models.  
Development of multifunctional material properties for use in system optimization procedures.  
Design of optimum radiation protective materials to finish out deficiencies in the shield design at minimum mass and costs.

Our R&D Approach
The development of earth independence will extend human presence beyond low Earth orbit and cislunar space and onto Mars. The radiation exposures in deep space are largely from galactic cosmic rays or GCR. Among the types of radiation, the high energies associated with GCR have the most important biological effects.
Today, no effective direct ionizing radiation shielding is designed or implemented on the most advanced human spacecraft for deep-space missions. New technologies need being developed to increase crew mission duration in the space radiation environment. 
Particularly, which novel advanced research methods can be applied to design and manufacture advanced materials or combination of materials to lower the radiation level, inside a spacecraft, down to a level known “as low as reasonably achievable”?Reach out to learn more about our approach
Our Credentials
EmTDLab was invited to pitch this project during the Global Space and Technology Conference (GSTC) in Singapore.

Picture: GSTC Judges Panel
Our project was selected among a limited number of participants to be presented to space agencies and investors.
You can watch the entire live pitch on our YouTube Channel.
We received media coverage during a ""knowledge explainer"" interview realised by btcn.asia, a media dedicated to innovative technologies in Asia.

Our Goal: Start-up capital to escalate
The initial phase of the project has been covered by self-financing. This allowed EmTDLab to complete the basic research. Now, we need HK$ 790,000 fresh financing to elaborate our technology concept and formulate the application of our Space Radiation Protection Technologies - In other currencies this rounds up to: Euros: 95k or Singapore$: 145k or US$: 100k.
How do we use the funds?

Your Impact? Advancing the future of space exploration.
Your contribution will help to advance the future of space exploration. As of May 2020, 565 people have been in space (FAI definition). This was over a period of 59 years (1961-2020). By 2060, only 40 years from now, Mars only could be home to a self-sustaining colony of a million people (Bobby Braun, former NASA CTO, now Georgia Tech Professor).

Picture: Scientific Moonbase (credit SpaceX) shuttled by 100 passengers Starship
By backing our project you create immediate impact. Every dollar in the funding goes to  research and development of new advanced materials for space radiation protection. This has never been done by any private venture before.
Beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), across the Van Allen Belts and en route to the Moon, Mars and beyond, astronauts need to be protected from radiation. Within the next  10 years (2020-2030), there will be plenty of exciting moments of space travel, planetary research, and even colonization: SpaceX Dragon Demo-2 to ISS (2020), NASA Mars Rover Launch Toward Mars (2020), ExoMars Reaches the Martian Surface (2021), Roscosmos Begins Offering Space Tours (2021), India Enters Crewed Spaceflight (2021-2022), SpaceX Launches a Mission to Mars (2022), China Launches a Third Space Station (2022), ESA Creates an Asteroid Insurance Policy (2023), SpaceX's First Moon Tourism Trip (2023), OSIRIS-REx's Asteroid Sample Return (2023), NASA's Artemis Mission To The Moon (2024), JAXA's Takes a Trip to the Martian Moons (2025), The U.S. Habitat Arrives at the Lunar Gateway (2025), NASA's Mission to Titan (2026), ESA's JUICE Explorer Arrives at Jupiter (2029), NASA Mission to Mars (2030s).
Space exploration is our ultimate goal. However, we know by experience that, during that journey we will make discoveries that will lead to applications closer to our daily concerns: new materials for airplanes and materials for radiation protection on earth.

<h3>Comfort is Key</h3>
<p>We designed CAPACITA to be comfortable under any load. CAPACITA fits riders from 5' to 6'4"" and we gave it an adjustable stem. Adjustable stems can give you a seemingly infinite number of riding positions. We recommend finding the one that feels best and sticking to that. Just a quick adjustment and you'll be on your way.</p>

<h3>Power where you need it</h3>
<p>No complicated and ugly crank-drive, no clunky-transmission, just effortless power right where you need it. We test rode some front wheel motors currently on the market and couldn’t stand the way it affected steering and traction. Our rear-mounted motor keeps the bike balanced and delivers performance directly to the rear wheel, so it’s all “grip” and “go”, no hiccups or false starts. For CAPACITA, we're using the tried, tested, and true Bafang 350W motor.</p>

<h3><a href=""http://www.outershelladventure.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Outer Shell Adventure</a></h3>
<p>Outer Shell stands against disposable culture and makes durable gear with a warranty. As a small two-person operation, they have a complete perspective from designing to testing to manufacturing. Each phase is given the same meticulous attention to detail. All products, except for the Dry Bags, are made in San Francisco, CA! The extra large pannier was created especially for the extended rear rack on the Capacita and you have the option to buy the bags as a set or only one side. The front bag fits the Capacita's front basket perfectly and is very useful for storing your small accessories (wallet, phone, keys, lights, food, dogs? etc...)</p>

<p>Pure Cycles was founded with one sole mission: to get more people on bikes. For 7 years, Pure Cycles has designed, developed, and delivered over 150,000 of the coolest bikes on the market, around the world. It all began in a dorm room in Madison, Wisconsin, the founders looking out at bike racks below and wondering why there were so few bikes in general, and so few cool bikes, specifically. Asking around campus, the founders kept coming back to the same sticking points - people wanted to ride, but they wanted bikes that were simple, affordable, and (maybe most importantly) looked awesome.</p>
<p>Pure Fix Cycles was born to make the bikes younger generations were seeking. What began as a quest to make the perfect campus bike, expanded as did the company. The office moved to Los Angeles, the team grew, advocacy and charity became priorities, and the brand expanded internationally, and soon Pure Cycles had cultivated a large team of passionate bike riders and a loyal customer base.</p>
<p>Today, as <a href=""https://www.purecycles.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pure Cycles</a>, the brand offers bikes that span several disciplines and occasions. Electric bikes, road bikes, commuter bikes, Pure Cycles is always cooking up new ideas because their community always find new places and ways to ride! From the successful Kickstarter to breathe life into their e-bike, the Volta, to the top-secret newness peeking over the next horizon, each and every development furthers their goal that started it all - to get more people on bikes.</p>

<p>It was during Michael and Austin’s college career at UW Madison that they realized the shortage of cool, affordable bikes available on the market. When they returned to LA and launched Pure Cycles, Michael took the reins on all things fiscal. Crunching numbers, forecasting financials, and oiling the machine that would become the best bike company in the country has kept him busy (and happy) for the last 7 years.</p>

<p>With an eye for quality and an instinct for international relations, Austin is responsible for our production relationships, assembly facilities, and the logistics of running a worldwide enterprise out of a dorm room. We’ve come a long way since those early days and Austin’s been scaling up our operations with every new development to keep us on the top of our game. He's also wicked good at karaoke.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As a company, we thrive on challenges. We recognize that with the design, development, and introduction of any new product there are hurdles that we’ll face but, unlike most Indiegogo projects, we’ve been developing Capacita for 4 years prior to this roll out. We’ve also successfully designed, developed and deployed over 10 completely new models since our humble beginnings as a one-model bike company including <a href=""https://www.purecycles.com/products/volta-e-bike?variant=38155227402"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VOLTA - The Smartest E-Bike ever</a>.<br/><br/>After 7 years and all of those rollouts (over 150,000 bikes!) we have a deep understanding of the sticking points in the process and a well-oiled machine for overcoming the obstacles that pop up along the way. We have wonderful relationships with our manufacturers, supply chain, and everybody involved in the process of bringing these bikes to fruition, so we’re confident in our ability to deliver, on time and as promised. <br/><br/>We’re committed to making this process as transparent as possible to our supporters, so we’ll keep you in the loop regarding any and all developments, decisions, and possible delays, and we’re committed to our guarantee that these bikes will be rolling into people’s homes this year. <br/><br/>We appreciate your support on this dream of ours, and we’re thrilled to have your help in making Capacita a reality.</p>

After this point, the aging process will accelerate and the battery will need to be replaced.<br/>So, it'll depend on how often you ride and charge - but expect more than 500 charge cycles before you need to stress about batteries.</p></div></details><details style=""margin:1em 0;""><summary style=""display: list-item;padding:1em 1em 1em 1.25em;line-height: 1.2em;cursor: pointer;border:1px solid #dbdbdd;background:#f8f8fa;color: #000;""> <span style=""display: block;margin:-2.2em -1em -1em 2em;padding:1em;padding-left:0;font-weight: 700;""> How does Capacita get 40 miles of range? </span> </summary><div style=""padding:1.25em 2em 2em;background:#fff;padding-bottom:1.25em;""><p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;"">The short answer is science.<br/>The long answer is, thanks to its light weight and 24"" wheels, acceleration doesn't require the huge spikes in power you'll need on other e-rides. The pedal-assist system, high-quality torque sensor, and high-quality controller mean there's no wasted power when you don't need it. And, lastly, our development of adaptive power modes means the bike sips from the battery as needed.<br/>The results of all that engineering elbow-grease is an e-bike that can roll for 40 miles in eco-mode and 20+ miles in power-mode.

If you (or a paint shop) take the bike apart, paint it, and can't put it back together or damage something in the process, that wouldn't be covered. Basically, you'll just want to be careful and not damage the components or electronics.

<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;"">We have been developing this bike for past 3 years and there have been many samples made and specs changed to better the ride and performance of the bike. Since we made the video 6 months ago, we have made the following exciting changes!</p>
<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;""><br/>Rear hub motor (previous design had a front hub motor). The rear hub motors provides better control and a better feel of the power coming from the system. We also added a slightly larger battery to power the 350W motor.<br/>Front and rear disc brakes (previous design had drum brakes). Disc brakes giving superior braking performance that is required when using an electric bike (especially one that is built to carry a lot of cargo!)</p>
<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;""><br/>8 speed Sram trigger shifter gearing (previous design was a single speed bike). The combination of the 8 gears and the pedal assistance from the rear motor means you can always find the most efficient gear and pedal level to carry a lot of gear and go the distance!</p>
<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;""><br/>Fat 24” x 2.35” WTB Thickslick tires. WTB opened a custom mold just for the Capacita and these fat tires are going to add a great look to the bike and make the ride extremely comfy.</p>
<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;""><br/>Removable foot platforms. The foot platforms will allow for kids on the back of the bike to comfortably rest their feet. The platforms will also help with securing rear pannier bags.</p>
<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;""><br/>Extended rear rack. This new design will allow for the rider to carry more gear (or children)!</p>
<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;""><br/>Extended wheelbase. This new, slightly longer wheelbase will allow for larger riders to be comfortable on the bike.</p>

<p style=""margin:0;font-size: 1.15em;line-height: 1.65em;"">Capacita is using a 350W motor (instead of a 750w motor like RadWagon) and the power feels incredibly strong even with cargo included for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capacita is approx. 20 lbs lighter than the RadWagon. The design is more streamlined - actually looks stylish :). A lighter bike can use a smaller and lighter motor.</li>
<li>Smaller 24” wheels take less power to turn and accelerate vs. 26” wheels on the RadWagon.</li>
<li>Capacita uses a torque sensor (vs a cadence sensor that rad power uses) to deliver power when it is necessary (when you actually need it - the more pressure put on the pedals, like going up a hill, the more power you will receive. Vs. a cadence sensor which gives you power the faster you push the pedals).</li>
<li>Capacita is pedal assist only so you are doing some of the work vs. RadWagon where most people are using a throttle (which takes more juice).</li>

From taking your kids to school, to hauling heavy cargo, to riding 40 miles without breaking a sweat, to the peace of mind that comes from GPS security tracking – our CAPACITA's packed with perks to keep you happy in the saddle.   If you are going to replace car trips with your electric bike shouldn’t it contain the same basic safety and convenience features as a car? We thought so too and that is why Capacita comes standard with integrated lights, space for cargo and storage, an integrated lock, and has power assist so you never arrive anywhere sweaty. The Capacita cargo bike rides just like a regular sized bike yet can handle big cargo loads with ease. Smart, safe, stylish, and comfortable, Capacita finally lets you leave your car in the garage.  From Palo Alto to San Francisco, from Brooklyn to the Bronx and back, with 40 miles of power your rides are no longer limited by your legs. Let your imagination plan your route and see where it takes you. 

 

Anti-theft GPS tracking so you’ll never lose your ride.
Theft is one of the worst things that can happen to a bike (and its rider). We integrated GPS tracking into the Capacita so even when it’s out of sight, it’s never out of mind and, if the unthinkable happens, you’ll be able to point the cops right to your ride.


 

Cargo for Days
We built this thing from the ground up with cargo in mind. What cargo? All of it! Kids, gear, kegs, cats, the whole nine yards. The racks can hold a total of 175 lbs so all your carrying needs are covered.

* Total Payload Capacity 300lbs


Room for everything and more
The high capacity front basket lets you load up your bike without sacrificing stability. With plenty of room for a briefcase, a case of beer, or all the stuff for setting up Steve’s surprise party – you can keep your back free of packs and still arrive with everything you need.
We even built an integrated lock holder!


 

Integrated automatic headlights and taillights activate at the first sign of low-light, and the automatic brake light helps keep you visible on the road, in traffic, and wherever your adventures take you. No hassle, no headaches, just illumination when you need it.


 

Don't have space or a plug in your garage? Worry not! You can remove the battery to charge up in your living room, office, or anywhere else.
 
The battery we're using is the high capacity Samsung 42V, 10Ah

Comfort is Key
We designed CAPACITA to be comfortable under any load. CAPACITA fits riders from 5' to 6'4"" and we gave it an adjustable stem. Adjustable stems can give you a seemingly infinite number of riding positions. We recommend finding the one that feels best and sticking to that. Just a quick adjustment and you'll be on your way.

 

Precious cargo requires high quality stopping power in rain or shine. We're using high performance disc brakes to make sure that you can stop on a dime regardless of cargo or conditions.

 

Who needs a heavy front suspension? The CAPACITA sports super-wide 24x2.35 tires. That means you'll cruise off bumps, and cracks like they're not even there. It'll be like riding on a cloud.

 

Power where you need it
No complicated and ugly crank-drive, no clunky-transmission, just effortless power right where you need it. We test rode some front wheel motors currently on the market and couldn’t stand the way it affected steering and traction. Our rear-mounted motor keeps the bike balanced and delivers performance directly to the rear wheel, so it’s all “grip” and “go”, no hiccups or false starts. For CAPACITA, we're using the tried, tested, and true Bafang 350W motor.

We teamed up with some friends to bring you the coolest e-bike accessories we could find.
Outer Shell Adventure
Outer Shell stands against disposable culture and makes durable gear with a warranty. As a small two-person operation, they have a complete perspective from designing to testing to manufacturing. Each phase is given the same meticulous attention to detail. All products, except for the Dry Bags, are made in San Francisco, CA! The extra large pannier was created especially for the extended rear rack on the Capacita and you have the option to buy the bags as a set or only one side. The front bag fits the Capacita's front basket perfectly and is very useful for storing your small accessories (wallet, phone, keys, lights, food, dogs? etc...)

Thousand
As a long time cyclist, Gloria was never a fan of wearing a bicycle helmet. She thought they were too bulky, too “sci-fi”, too hard to lug around. But after losing a friend to a fatal bike accident, she knew she needed to change. 
;
Hiplok
All Hiplok locks are designed and developed in the UK by a small dedicated team of innovators and bike riders. From the patented adjustable belt fastening on their wearable chain locks to the CLIP + RIDE on the D-locks and ultra-reflectivity of the SUPERBRIGHT Series, they believe the small details make a big difference to the enjoyment of the ride. Their new DX E-Bike lock was developed with the e-bike specifically in mind as it is one of the strongest locks on the market and comes with both a chain and u-lock so that you can lock all parts of the bike.

 

Pure Cycles was founded with one sole mission: to get more people on bikes. For 7 years, Pure Cycles has designed, developed, and delivered over 150,000 of the coolest bikes on the market, around the world. It all began in a dorm room in Madison, Wisconsin, the founders looking out at bike racks below and wondering why there were so few bikes in general, and so few cool bikes, specifically. Asking around campus, the founders kept coming back to the same sticking points - people wanted to ride, but they wanted bikes that were simple, affordable, and (maybe most importantly) looked awesome.
Pure Fix Cycles was born to make the bikes younger generations were seeking. What began as a quest to make the perfect campus bike, expanded as did the company. The office moved to Los Angeles, the team grew, advocacy and charity became priorities, and the brand expanded internationally, and soon Pure Cycles had cultivated a large team of passionate bike riders and a loyal customer base.
Today, as Pure Cycles, the brand offers bikes that span several disciplines and occasions. Electric bikes, road bikes, commuter bikes, Pure Cycles is always cooking up new ideas because their community always find new places and ways to ride! From the successful Kickstarter to breathe life into their e-bike, the Volta, to the top-secret newness peeking over the next horizon, each and every development furthers their goal that started it all - to get more people on bikes.

After 4 years of studying Computer Science at Columbia, Jordan returned home ready to launch the bike business with his buds. Since then he’s overseen the tech side of things, building the website, turning Pure Cycles into one of the premier web-retailers in the bike space, and ensuring that our customer service is always the best in the industry. 

It was during Michael and Austin’s college career at UW Madison that they realized the shortage of cool, affordable bikes available on the market. When they returned to LA and launched Pure Cycles, Michael took the reins on all things fiscal. Crunching numbers, forecasting financials, and oiling the machine that would become the best bike company in the country has kept him busy (and happy) for the last 7 years.

With an eye for quality and an instinct for international relations, Austin is responsible for our production relationships, assembly facilities, and the logistics of running a worldwide enterprise out of a dorm room. We’ve come a long way since those early days and Austin’s been scaling up our operations with every new development to keep us on the top of our game. He's also wicked good at karaoke.

Risks and challenges
As a company, we thrive on challenges. We recognize that with the design, development, and introduction of any new product there are hurdles that we’ll face but, unlike most Indiegogo projects, we’ve been developing Capacita for 4 years prior to this roll out. We’ve also successfully designed, developed and deployed over 10 completely new models since our humble beginnings as a one-model bike company including VOLTA - The Smartest E-Bike ever.After 7 years and all of those rollouts (over 150,000 bikes!) we have a deep understanding of the sticking points in the process and a well-oiled machine for overcoming the obstacles that pop up along the way. We have wonderful relationships with our manufacturers, supply chain, and everybody involved in the process of bringing these bikes to fruition, so we’re confident in our ability to deliver, on time and as promised. We’re committed to making this process as transparent as possible to our supporters, so we’ll keep you in the loop regarding any and all developments, decisions, and possible delays, and we’re committed to our guarantee that these bikes will be rolling into people’s homes this year. We appreciate your support on this dream of ours, and we’re thrilled to have your help in making Capacita a reality.

FAQs
 
If you could not find what you're looking for here, please email us at support@purecycles.com and/or leave us a comment on Indiegogo. We will get back to you ASAP!  What is Pedal Assist?  No throttles, no accelerator, just the motor seamlessly backing you up when you push the pedals. Your leg power is supplemented by the motor, every time your feet go around. Stop pedaling and the motor backs off too. Simple.  What sizes does it come in?  The Capacita comes in one size: perfect. 24"" wheels help keep the bike low enough for smaller riders, and the adjustable seat post raises the saddle up for taller ones. Additionally, the adjustable stem allows for a rider of any height to feel upright and comfy. We've had test pilots from 5'0"" to 6'4"" cruise comfortably for miles.  Who is going to build this thing?  The bike will arrive 90% assembled and all that will be required to get the bike riding will be to put on the front wheel, the handlebar, the seat post and saddle, and the pedals. Simple! We do suggest that before your first ride you take the bike to your local bike shop to ensure the brakes are tuned properly and all bolts are tight!  Is the bike waterproof?  You know it! Well, it's weatherproof. Rainproof. You can't ride along the bottom of the ocean, or take it in the pool, but if there's water in the sky or on the road, you'll pedal on just fine.  What is the weight limit on the front rack?  Your imagination*, plus 45 pounds.*Your imagination, while limitless, weighs nothing.  Does the bike come standard with the front basket and the extended rear rack?  Yes, it does! They are both included!  How much noise does Capacita make?  That depends on how loudly you go, ""Weeeeeeee!"". The chain drive makes a bit more noise (chainy sounds and freewheel clicks when you coast, just like an ordinary bike), but these aren't mopeds - you won't wake the neighbors.  What's the motor's top speed?  20 mph! For legal reasons, the power on the bike will tap out at 20 mph but you can, of course, pedal faster to push beyond that 20mph limit. This is a class 1 e-bike (only type that is legal in NYC!).  What brand is the motor?  BAFANG, a leading manufacturer of e-mobility components.  Why did you choose a 350W motor?  Because 250W just didn’t feel like enough “oomph” with the added cargo that Capacita is built to lug around. 350W provides plenty of power while still hitting our goals for weight, appearance, and affordability.  What's the weight limit on the Capacita?  275 lbs  What is the total payload capacity for the bike?  350 lbs  How much weight can the rear rack hold?  175 lbs  How much weight can each side platform running boards hold?  Up to 40 lbs per side  Does the Capacita come with a kickstand?  Yes! It is a dual leg kickstand.  How long will the battery last before it needs replacing?  Battery life depends on use and conditions and, even with proper care, rechargeable batteries won't last forever. Conservatively, our Li-Ion battery will last about 500–750 cycles.A partial charge/ discharge counts fractionally against those numbers; so running the battery down halfway then recharging it completely uses up one half of a charge cycle.“End of useful life” refers to the point at which a battery can no longer supply 70% of its original rated capacity in ampere- hours. After this point, the aging process will accelerate and the battery will need to be replaced.So, it'll depend on how often you ride and charge - but expect more than 500 charge cycles before you need to stress about batteries.  How does Capacita get 40 miles of range?  The short answer is science.The long answer is, thanks to its light weight and 24"" wheels, acceleration doesn't require the huge spikes in power you'll need on other e-rides. The pedal-assist system, high-quality torque sensor, and high-quality controller mean there's no wasted power when you don't need it. And, lastly, our development of adaptive power modes means the bike sips from the battery as needed.The results of all that engineering elbow-grease is an e-bike that can roll for 40 miles in eco-mode and 20+ miles in power-mode. This bikes got a big brain for a reason.  What colors does the Capacita come in?  Initially, matte black, silver, and hi-vis yellow. When we hit our goal, though, we may be able to roll out more!  How is pedal assist adjusted and can you describe the experience of the ""levels"" of pedal assist as it relates to battery life, range, and the feel of the ride (e.g. going up a hill, pedaling from a stop position, etc)?  As you pedal, the motor senses the force you're applying (thanks to the torque-sensor in the bottom bracket) and supplements your effort by powering the rear wheel. The amount of electric backup the motor provides will depend on your power mode (bike, eco, or power).In terms of battery use vs. power, the more support you use, the more battery you'll use too. That adjustment is made by selecting the power mode that's right for your ride. Power mode:Feels like: ""Push the pedals and just fly!""Range: We tested a bit over 20 milesEco Mode:Feels like: ""Wow, I don't remember my commute being this easy, I should ride every day!""Range: We tested a bit over 40 milesBike Mode:Feels like: ""Just like riding a bike.""Range: As far as your legs will take you  Can you remove the front basket?  Yes!  Where is your store? I live in LA and would love to test drive the prototype.  Awesome! Our HQ is in Burbank at 713 N. Victory Blvd, 91502If you're interested in a test ride, please contact us at support@purecycles.com and we'll set something up for you!  Does this bike have gears? Why does an electric bike need gears?  The bike has 8 gears with the 1x8 Sram trigger shifter setup. Electric bikes should have gears because although the electric motor takes away much of the strain, it is still useful to have gears whenever you decide to pedal while cruising, trying to get more exercise, carry more gear, or extend your range. The combination of the 8 gears and the pedal assistance from the rear motor means you can always find the most efficient gear and pedal level to carry a lot of gear and go the distance!  Is the app for iOS only or is there also going to be an Android app as well?  The app will work for both iOS and Android  Will the bike be able to support attaching various kid bike trailers (both the ones that attach at the wheel and seat post)?  It'll really depend on the spec of the trailer/tow-along. Seatpost mounted trailers should work just fine, but the wheel mounted ones will come down to the trailers' mounting set-up, how much axle they need, whether the mount inside or outside the dropout, etc...We'll be sure to try some out to figure out what plays nicely and what doesn't once we've got some in shops (and places that have various styles of trailers).  How much will a replacement battery cost?  New batteries will cost $399.  Is it possible to check how much battery is left?  Yep! The phone app will show you much charge you have left, so you can ride comfortably knowing you'll make it all the way home!  Are you guys setting up the GPS with every country? Or do we do it ourselves?  We've got it all worked out so all you'll need to worry about is where you want to ride! The GPS/anti-theft stuff is all worked out on our end, wherever you are in the world.  Is it possible to ride Capacita if I forgot my phone one day by accident or lost it?  Absolutely! The bike is still operable via the fob that will come with every bike (think of it like your car keys).  Will the bike have a firmware updates? i.e. Optimize battery/engine usage in different modes, release create new modes, etc…  Yup! We'll be improving the software right along with the hardware and we'll push updates out to riders so everyone can enjoy an improved experience!  How easy is it to adjust the seat up and down, are any tools needed?  Super easy and just like a standard bike! You'll need an allen key to loosen (and re-tighten) the seat post collar, then just raise or lower the saddle to your desired height!  Is it possible to turn on the lights manually without the auto light sensor kicking in?  Yes! Or you can let them do their thing automatically when the road gets dark!  Which type of lock do you recommend? Does a U-Lock fit through the rear wheel, the rear frame triangle, and around a possible pole? Which locking systems are you currently using and how?  Great question! We recommend using a chain and U-lock combination like the Hiplok E-DX that we are offering as one of the perks. The noose chain and DX shackle combine to give you extended locking options and maximum protection. For a technique breakdown, check out this ""how to lock up your ride"" post we wrote up a few years ago! ( https://www.purecycles.com/blogs/bicycle-news/9...).  About GPS — How much will it cost in the United States and other countries to maintain the service?  In the US and worldwide it'll be about $49 per year, but we're working hard on getting that number down! We plan to give our backers a couple months free in the beginning :)  Would a baby bike seat or bike trailer work with the Capacita? — If so, are there any types of baby seats or preferred brands/models that would work better?  Yes! We designed the extended rear rack so that two child seats can fit but we can’t yet confirm if this will be possible yet.We love the Thule Yepp Maxi seats!  How do you recommend locking/securing the front wheel? Above you'll see our overall locking recommendations, and when it comes to the front wheel you'll just want something to secure it to the frame or a stable/permanent fixture.If you lock your rear wheel and frame to the bike rack, then you can use your second lock to secure the front wheel to the frame or the front wheel to the bike rack! For wheel to frame, you're probably looking at a chain lock to give you the reach. For wheel to rack a u-lock will work just fine!  What plugs are provided for charging? Is it only American, would I need an adapter?  Capacita will plug into the wall and charge from a 110V (US) or 220V (International) outlet and it'll ship with the standard plug of your country, so you shouldn't need an adapter!  Does Capacita have a red rear reflector?  All our bikes ship with reflectors in the box so you can hit the road legally and the Capacita will be no exception! They don't look very cool in photos, so they're not on the prototype, but you can mount yours right on the seatpost, or wherever you prefer to have it pointing behind you.Capacita also has the integrated and automatic taillight, and that'll provide even better rear visibility than a reflector.  What's the power output on the motor?  350 Watts  Will we void our warranty if we paint our bikes?  That's kind of a tough one. If you take a brush and put some paint on the frame, that shouldn't have any effect on the bike and you'll still be fine. If you (or a paint shop) take the bike apart, paint it, and can't put it back together or damage something in the process, that wouldn't be covered. Basically, you'll just want to be careful and not damage the components or electronics. For most people, that'll just mean not trying to paint the bike, but if you've got the chops to do it without any damage, there shouldn't be a problem putting some paint on there!  How will the warranty be handled for people not in the US?  Overseas warranties will be routed through our local dealers and distributors. We'll still have you covered, wherever you are.  What is the warranty policy?  24-month warranty on all electrical parts (motor, battery, etc..) and lifetime warranty on frame and fork.  Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties, or VAT?  The backer is responsible.  How much is the shipping fee?  The shipping cost is different for each model and each country. Please refer to the perk details.  Will I be able to buy replacement parts or spare parts?  All parts on the Capacita can be bought at our online store at an affordable price. In case something happens to your bike, we’ve produced a selection of helpful video tutorials on how to fix the most common issues.  If I buy only the bike now and the campaign ends will I still be able to come back later (before the bike ships) and buy the accessories for the same price (pannier bags, front bag, extra battery, etc…)?  Yes, we will send out emails before your bike ships and offer last minute offers on our accessories and extra bikes as well.  Are you working on any other Capacita specific accessories?  Yes! We have a lot of cool accessories that we are developing now, and we will be offering these to all backers after the campaign ends but before your bikes ship. Currently, we are developing a railing system for the rear rack that will provide stability for children sitting on the rear deck. We are also working on a comfy rear rack deck pad for kids to sit on and a ring/handlebar that kids can hold onto while sitting on the deck pad.  How is the price so affordable?  We’re selling our cargo e-bike at a huge discount to guarantee we can start up production. We can sell Capacita at this affordable price, because you are buying directly from us, the manufacturer, and cutting out all intermediaries  Why is shipping so expensive to Europe?  There is a lot of uncertainty with new looming import regulations for importing electric bikes from China into the EU. The EU is currently threatening a new anti-dumping measure that would add a huge tax to all e-bikes imported from China into Europe and we need to tread lightly until this outstanding issue is resolved. If the anti-dumping duty does come into effect, then we will refund the difference collected on the high shipping costs.  How will the warranty be handled for people not in the US?  Overseas warranties will be routed through our local dealers and distributors. We'll still have you covered, wherever you are.  Why does the bike that is being ridden in the video look different than in the other photos of the bikes on the page?  
We have been developing this bike for past 3 years and there have been many samples made and specs changed to better the ride and performance of the bike. Since we made the video 6 months ago, we have made the following exciting changes!
Rear hub motor (previous design had a front hub motor). The rear hub motors provides better control and a better feel of the power coming from the system. We also added a slightly larger battery to power the 350W motor.Front and rear disc brakes (previous design had drum brakes). Disc brakes giving superior braking performance that is required when using an electric bike (especially one that is built to carry a lot of cargo!)
8 speed Sram trigger shifter gearing (previous design was a single speed bike). The combination of the 8 gears and the pedal assistance from the rear motor means you can always find the most efficient gear and pedal level to carry a lot of gear and go the distance!
Fat 24” x 2.35” WTB Thickslick tires. WTB opened a custom mold just for the Capacita and these fat tires are going to add a great look to the bike and make the ride extremely comfy.
Removable foot platforms. The foot platforms will allow for kids on the back of the bike to comfortably rest their feet. The platforms will also help with securing rear pannier bags.
Extended rear rack. This new design will allow for the rider to carry more gear (or children)!
Extended wheelbase. This new, slightly longer wheelbase will allow for larger riders to be comfortable on the bike.
New headtube design. The new headtube design now hides all motor cutoff cables and brake cables for a nice, clean look.
  How long is the extended rear rack?  22.5""  How long are the foot platforms?  16.75"" each  Does the Capacita contain motor cut off sensors on the brakes so that the motor can’t be engaged while braking?  Yes! We are all about safety.  What is the length of the wheel base? Will it fit on my car rack?  49"" so the bike will fit in most car roof racks!  Why did you choose a your motor and how does compare to the RadWagon?  
Capacita is using a 350W motor (instead of a 750w motor like RadWagon) and the power feels incredibly strong even with cargo included for the following reasons:

Capacita is approx. 20 lbs lighter than the RadWagon. The design is more streamlined - actually looks stylish :). A lighter bike can use a smaller and lighter motor.
Smaller 24” wheels take less power to turn and accelerate vs. 26” wheels on the RadWagon.
Capacita uses a torque sensor (vs a cadence sensor that rad power uses) to deliver power when it is necessary (when you actually need it - the more pressure put on the pedals, like going up a hill, the more power you will receive. Vs. a cadence sensor which gives you power the faster you push the pedals).
Capacita is pedal assist only so you are doing some of the work vs. RadWagon where most people are using a throttle (which takes more juice).

  How can you see battery % level?  The battery % can be accessed three different ways: (1) via your phone app, (2) via lights on the battery casing, and (3) via a light on the on/off button on the downtube of the bike. Can somebody easily steal the battery? Nope! The battery comes with a key so you can lock it to the bike!  What is the total length of the bike?  74.5”  What is your refund policy?  We are subject to Indiegogo's refund policy.   Click here to read more about refunds.",46.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The Babel Bikes are built throughout with high quality components including Shimano Steps motor, with Di2 gear change (Babel Electric bikes only), Alphine Hub gears and Hydraulic disk brakes. They are also fitted with a lot of components that most bikes don't even have, such as a custom made seat, wing mirrors, indicators, hazard flashers, seat belts, auto-alarm system etc. And of course included in the cost is the price of all the safety tests - features that are unique to the Babel. So in short, the Babel Bikes may not be the cheapest bikes on the market - they are, however, the safest. And for Indiegogo buyers there are BIG savings to be made whilst the campaign is running (up to £500 off) whilst UK income tax payers (in regular employment) can benefit further from the UK Govts Cycle to Work Scheme' - see <a href=""http://www.babelbike.com/discounts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.babelbike.com/discounts</a> for full details, then come back to THIS page and buy the '£103 Perk' to secure this option.

<p>Hello everyone! My name is RJ Jimenez. My passion of cycling had drove me to the next level. When I ride my bicycle I felt free. I felt like freedom embraced me each time I give in. However, that was not enouph. I wanted to give in more and then a sudden though appeared before me. What if I can extend that freedom and feel more free. What if I can lift up my arms without balancing my entire body while riding a bicycle. What if I can feel the fresh breeze of the air be more fresh and strong. Ever since then the thought did not left me. I did not slept. I did not focus. All I though was I had to do something. Not just for me but for EVERYONE. What does the world need I keep asking myself. I found an aluminium tube at work and keep taping the tube in my arm for months. I could not rest until I found the reason why. I FOUND it! I did not slept. The night sleep had left me. I work all night till 6 am at the prototype and at 7 am I had to work on my normal job. After 5 years of hard work, Testing and design it; I had finish it! I felt ALIVE!</p>

Who I am.


Hello everyone! My name is RJ Jimenez. My passion of cycling had drove me to the next level. When I ride my bicycle I felt free. I felt like freedom embraced me each time I give in. However, that was not enouph. I wanted to give in more and then a sudden though appeared before me. What if I can extend that freedom and feel more free. What if I can lift up my arms without balancing my entire body while riding a bicycle. What if I can feel the fresh breeze of the air be more fresh and strong. Ever since then the thought did not left me. I did not slept. I did not focus. All I though was I had to do something. Not just for me but for EVERYONE. What does the world need I keep asking myself. I found an aluminium tube at work and keep taping the tube in my arm for months. I could not rest until I found the reason why. I FOUND it! I did not slept. The night sleep had left me. I work all night till 6 am at the prototype and at 7 am I had to work on my normal job. After 5 years of hard work, Testing and design it; I had finish it! I felt ALIVE!

I am fairly tall, 6’6” to be exact, and it was really difficult to find an inexpensive bicycle that would fit me.

So, I bought a large frame and all of the parts required to build a budget fixie exactly as I wanted. After few months I started thinking about how I could improve it.

That's the day that I started this project, without even knowing it! After sharing my thoughts on how to improve the bike with several friends and family members, they started encouraging me to design it and put it into production. But I wasn’t quite sure where to start. So, I decided to save enough money to fly and visit different suppliers around the world to propose my drawings and ideas of the bicycle that I envisioned. A bike that is always ready to ride, beautiful, innovative and affordable. I received a lot of ""we will let you know"", but eventually I found people that really believed in the bike. I am thankful for their daily support. It's an unreal feeling to see a product for the first time, and know that's it, that’s the perfect bike. A product that transpired from a thought to a concept, from a concept to a design, from a design to a simply beautiful bicycle that is practical and easy to maintain.

<p>Looking for more details? If the specs above don't answer your questions, check out our <a href=""https://support.flashbike.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Help Center</a> with tons of specific answers to questions on a range of topics, from bike fit, to battery usage, to service and warranty, and more.</p>
<p>Below are some of our more frequently asked questions:</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Buying Flash</h2>
<p><i><strong>Will you ship outside of the United States?</strong></i></p>
<p><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Unfortunately, we do not ship internationally and we can't warranty the bike if it's used outside of the United States, as it isn't designed to work internationally. The details around that are very boring, but it's related to certifications, regulations, and wireless performance. Sorry!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>How many frame sizes are there? Am I the right height and weight?</strong></i></p>
<p>Flash is currently offered as a single one-size-fits-most frame, with a suggested rider’s height of 5’3” up to 6’2”.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that we designed Flash with an angled down tube so that it's easier for people with shorter legs or physical limitations to get on and off.</p>
<p><a href=""https://support.flashbike.io/hc/en-us/articles/115004984667-How-big-is-Flash-Am-I-the-right-height-and-weight-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out this Help Center article</a> for lots of detailed sizing information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Can I attach accessories like a rack or fenders?</strong></i></p>
<p>Yes! Check out this list of <a href=""https://support.flashbike.io/hc/en-us/articles/115005176828-Can-I-add-accessories-like-racks-fenders-etc-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compatible third-party accessories</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>For what kind of riding is Flash intended? Can I take it mountain biking?</strong></i></p>
<p>Flash is intended to be a great bike for light recreation, getting around town without your car, exploring on a Saturday afternoon, etc. We think Flash is fantastic for that sort of general use, but if you have other more specific biking needs, we'd rather be clear so that you don't end up with a different expectation as to how Flash should perform.</p>
<p>With that said, please understand that Flash was not built to be a cargo bike for hauling tons of gear, nor is it intended by design to be used for long-distance touring or towing. Flash performs best on pavement and can handle light trail use, but it's certainly not meant to be ridden as a mountain bike.</p>
<p>We love to ride Flash to and from the office every day, but if you're a hardcore bike commuter with specific needs around weight and specialized accessories, then Flash may not suit your needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>How assembled is the bike when it arrives?</strong></i></p>
<p>Flash arrives partially assembled. You'll need to spend about 15 minutes on final assembly, using some required tools (crescent wrench, allen wrench, torque wrench). You'll be doing things like attaching the wheels and pedals, and tightening the handlebars. Honestly, it's not too difficult and the manual will walk you through it. If you have any questions during final assembly, just let us know. If you're concerned about physical strength, a tech at your local bike shop can do it very quickly and easily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>What sort of return policy and warranty does Flash come with?</strong></i></p>
<p>If, at any point during the first 30 days after you receive your Flash, you feel that the bike does not match how it was described to you on our website or through any communications with us, please contact us to discuss a return. Bike components are warrantied for 2 years. Electronics are warrantied for 1 year. <a href=""https://support.flashbike.io/hc/en-us/articles/115006208928-What-is-Flash-s-return-policy-and-warranty-coverage-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read our full warranty here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Can I cancel my order for a refund?</strong></i></p>
<p>Orders can be cancelled and refunded at any time prior to order fulfillment (when we ship the bike to you). The process and amount of refund both depend on whether our Indiegogo campaign has ended.</p>
<p><i>If our Indiegogo campaign is still active:</i><br/>Please refer to Indiegogo's <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876-Refunds-Can-I-get-my-money-back-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">refund policy</a> and instructions for <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/213172367"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">requesting a refund</a>.</p>
<p><i>If our Indiegogo campaign has ended:</i><br/>Please <a href=""https://support.flashbike.io/hc/en-us/requests/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact us directly</a> to request an order cancellation and a refund of your payment minus a 10% fee (to cover processing fees and Indiegogo platform fees).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Riding and Maintaining Flash</h2>
<p><i><strong>Can the battery be removed from inside of the frame?</strong></i></p>
<p>Flash's battery is inside the bike frame (within the down tube, to be exact), and is not intended to be removed by the rider. We realize that some people prefer to be able to swap out the battery, but our preference is for a simpler and cleaner design. Putting the battery inside the frame also helps us keep Flash lighter and more affordable, and protects the battery from theft. Should the battery need service, it can be removed from the frame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>How do I charge Flash? And how long will it take?</strong></i></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJrqw-a3ReY?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>For more details on battery usage and maintenance, <a href=""https://support.flashbike.io/hc/en-us/categories/115000871188-Riding-Flash"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">check out these articles</a> in our Help Center.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>What do I do when my bike needs service?</strong></i></p>
<p><i>For mechanical issues with general bike parts–including wheels/tires, brakes, cables, shifter, chain, cranks/pedals and seat–just head on in to your local bike shop. For any issues with electrical components–including the battery, motor, touchscreen, lights and handlebar controls–we'll work directly with you to resolve the issue.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>App &amp; Wireless Connectivity​</h2>
<p><i><strong>Is there an additional cost for the wireless service?</strong></i></p>
<p>Nope! There is no additional cost for cellular service. You don't even need to set anything up. Every Flash arrives connected and ready to go. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>How does Flash's wireless connectivity work? Do I need to set that up?</strong></i></p>
<p>Flash uses a combination of Bluetooth and wireless technology to connect with your phone and send you updates on battery and alert status, as well as provide turn-by-turn navigation.</p>
<p>In order to set up all of this functionality, the only thing you need to do is pair your phone with your Flash during initial setup. This allows the two to communicate securely and seamlessly. When you receive your Flash and launch the app on your phone, you'll be walked through the quick and secure pairing process. Once that is complete, you're good to go.</p>
<p>You don't need to do anything to set up your Flash's wireless connection. The bike arrives connected and ready to go, and it is completely separate from your own personal wireless account. You don't ever have to deal with it (or pay for it). Just get out and ride!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Will Flash's wireless coverage work in my area?</strong></i></p>

</div></div>","Our purpose-built features and technology–obsessively developed from the ground-up in order to address concerns over distance, safety and security–are baked right into the bike, so you don’t have to worry about a thing.Flash isn't just an electric bike; it's an evolution in what a bike can be.Campaign Update Our Indiegogo campaign ended on July 11, 2017, but you can order Flash bikes and accessories on our own website, right now! Features  Your current battery charge level, speed and pedal assist level are always visible on the high-resolution touchscreen, mounted inside the frame just below the handlebars.The 500 watt geared rear hub motor provides 48 N.m. of torque. In English? Flash is quick off the line from a stop, and climbs up hills with ease. All with minimal pedal resistance.  Handlebar controls from left to right: 7-speed Shimano shifter, 3-level headlight control (top), electric horn (middle), turn signal (bottom), and grip throttle for the electric motor.The high-intensity LED headlight and 360° running lights are custom designed as part of Flash’s integrated electrical system meant to keep you visible, day or night.The rear brake light is triggered when you squeeze either brake lever, alerting everyone behind you of your change in speed and keeping you safe during sudden stops.  Use the high-resolution touchscreen to arm the security system, or simply turn off the bike.In the case of theft, security alerts are sent immediately to your phone and we can help track it down with GPS location.  A 6-digit PIN code is required in order to disarm your Flash.No need to look at your phone. The Flash app sends navigation info directly to your bike.

Perks & Upgrades In an effort to keep Flash as affordable as possible–and keep the buying process as simple as possible–we are not offering a multitude of Perks with various modifications and upgrades for you to decipher with a spreadsheet and calculator.Instead, our perks follow a simple structure: the earlier you order, the better pricing and shipping date you'll get.Every perk features the same bike with all the features described below and on our website. All you have to decide on is your favorite color:Shipping is limited to the United States only. Flash is not designed to work internationally, due to issues concerning certifications, regulations, and wireless performance. ** NEW CAMPAIGN PERK **We have received lots of feedback from folks wanting fenders to keep themselves clean on their daily commute. So we went back to the drawing board and came up with a set of custom front and rear fenders, specifically designed to fit seamlessly with a Flash v1 bike (shown here on the factory floor). These fenders are available as a separate perk for just $50 plus free shipping and will ship separately. Attaching these to your bike takes seconds, with just a few screws and nothing to remove.  We’re excited to partner with OTTO DesignWorks to offer the OTTOLOCK—a compact and lightweight cinch lock that’s perfect for short-stay security and peace of mind—as a special Stretch Reward for our campaign backers.If we reach $650,000 in contributions before our campaign ends on July 11, every bike ordered during our campaign will ship with a 30” black OTTOLOCK included, at no extra cost. Simple as that!Weighing just 155g and made of stainless steel and Kevlar, OTTOLOCK is stronger than a cable lock and significantly lighter than a U-Lock. It’s the perfect item to toss in your bag (or even your pocket!) for when you need to secure your Flash and run a quick errand.With our movement-sensitive alarm and OTTOLOCK working together to secure your Flash, theft opportunists will have to look elsewhere. *** UPDATE ***With just a few hours remaining in our campaign, we've reached our stretch goal! That means that as long as we remain above that target when the campaign ends tonight, every single Flash bike ordered during our campaign will ship with the OTTOLOCK included. Sweet! Referral RewardsGet your friends to contribute and you could earn a free Flash!If just one of your friends claims a bike perk, you’ll come away with a t-shirt and an extra battery charger for your Flash.

FAQs
Looking for more details? If the specs above don't answer your questions, check out our Help Center with tons of specific answers to questions on a range of topics, from bike fit, to battery usage, to service and warranty, and more.
Below are some of our more frequently asked questions:
 
Buying Flash
Will you ship outside of the United States?
Unfortunately, we do not ship internationally and we can't warranty the bike if it's used outside of the United States, as it isn't designed to work internationally. The details around that are very boring, but it's related to certifications, regulations, and wireless performance. Sorry!
 
How many frame sizes are there? Am I the right height and weight?
Flash is currently offered as a single one-size-fits-most frame, with a suggested rider’s height of 5’3” up to 6’2”.
It's also worth noting that we designed Flash with an angled down tube so that it's easier for people with shorter legs or physical limitations to get on and off.
Check out this Help Center article for lots of detailed sizing information.
 
Can I attach accessories like a rack or fenders?
Yes! Check out this list of compatible third-party accessories.
 
For what kind of riding is Flash intended? Can I take it mountain biking?
Flash is intended to be a great bike for light recreation, getting around town without your car, exploring on a Saturday afternoon, etc. We think Flash is fantastic for that sort of general use, but if you have other more specific biking needs, we'd rather be clear so that you don't end up with a different expectation as to how Flash should perform.
With that said, please understand that Flash was not built to be a cargo bike for hauling tons of gear, nor is it intended by design to be used for long-distance touring or towing. Flash performs best on pavement and can handle light trail use, but it's certainly not meant to be ridden as a mountain bike.
We love to ride Flash to and from the office every day, but if you're a hardcore bike commuter with specific needs around weight and specialized accessories, then Flash may not suit your needs.
 
How assembled is the bike when it arrives?
Flash arrives partially assembled. You'll need to spend about 15 minutes on final assembly, using some required tools (crescent wrench, allen wrench, torque wrench). You'll be doing things like attaching the wheels and pedals, and tightening the handlebars. Honestly, it's not too difficult and the manual will walk you through it. If you have any questions during final assembly, just let us know. If you're concerned about physical strength, a tech at your local bike shop can do it very quickly and easily.
 
What sort of return policy and warranty does Flash come with?
If, at any point during the first 30 days after you receive your Flash, you feel that the bike does not match how it was described to you on our website or through any communications with us, please contact us to discuss a return. Bike components are warrantied for 2 years. Electronics are warrantied for 1 year. Read our full warranty here.
 
Can I cancel my order for a refund?
Orders can be cancelled and refunded at any time prior to order fulfillment (when we ship the bike to you). The process and amount of refund both depend on whether our Indiegogo campaign has ended.
If our Indiegogo campaign is still active:Please refer to Indiegogo's refund policy and instructions for requesting a refund.
If our Indiegogo campaign has ended:Please contact us directly to request an order cancellation and a refund of your payment minus a 10% fee (to cover processing fees and Indiegogo platform fees).
 
Riding and Maintaining Flash
Can the battery be removed from inside of the frame?
Flash's battery is inside the bike frame (within the down tube, to be exact), and is not intended to be removed by the rider. We realize that some people prefer to be able to swap out the battery, but our preference is for a simpler and cleaner design. Putting the battery inside the frame also helps us keep Flash lighter and more affordable, and protects the battery from theft. Should the battery need service, it can be removed from the frame.
 
How do I charge Flash? And how long will it take?

For more details on battery usage and maintenance, check out these articles in our Help Center.
 
What do I do when my bike needs service?
For mechanical issues with general bike parts–including wheels/tires, brakes, cables, shifter, chain, cranks/pedals and seat–just head on in to your local bike shop. For any issues with electrical components–including the battery, motor, touchscreen, lights and handlebar controls–we'll work directly with you to resolve the issue.
 
App & Wireless Connectivity​
Is there an additional cost for the wireless service?
Nope! There is no additional cost for cellular service. You don't even need to set anything up. Every Flash arrives connected and ready to go. 
 
How does Flash's wireless connectivity work? Do I need to set that up?
Flash uses a combination of Bluetooth and wireless technology to connect with your phone and send you updates on battery and alert status, as well as provide turn-by-turn navigation.
In order to set up all of this functionality, the only thing you need to do is pair your phone with your Flash during initial setup. This allows the two to communicate securely and seamlessly. When you receive your Flash and launch the app on your phone, you'll be walked through the quick and secure pairing process. Once that is complete, you're good to go.
You don't need to do anything to set up your Flash's wireless connection. The bike arrives connected and ready to go, and it is completely separate from your own personal wireless account. You don't ever have to deal with it (or pay for it). Just get out and ride!
 
Will Flash's wireless coverage work in my area?
We use T-Mobile for Flash's wireless coverage in the United States. Please refer to T-Mobile's coverage map to check coverage in your area. Due to issues with certifications, regulations and wireless performance, Flash is not designed for wireless use outside of the United States.
 
Do I have to use the app in order to ride Flash?
When you first receive your Flash, you need to use the app for some initial setup, like creating your secure PIN code for the bike. After that initial setup, if you don’t want to use the app for anything else, you certainly don’t need to.
However, the app does provide you with some great features:

Live check-in on battery and security alert status, no matter where you are.
Arm/disarm Flash from any location.
Enter a destination on the app and Flash will guide you with turn-by-turn navigation.

Contact us at hello@flx.bike with any issues. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Are you hiring?</b></p><p>Yes, we have several positions available. Check them out and <a href=""http://flx.bike/career-application"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">apply here.</a></p><p> </p><p><b>Will the production bikes be exactly like the ones pictured?</b></p><p> </p><p>No. They will be even better. We have a few tweaks to make and reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your FLX bike even better. Since the photos were taken, we've already upgraded the motor from 540 to 650w, added a USB port in the display, changed Microshift gears for Shimano, and plan to make a couple other upgrades before your bike is ready!</p><p> </p><p><b>How do I choose the color?</b></p><p> </p><p>We're going to be announcing one or two more color choices before the end of the campaign. When the campaign ends, we'll send you a survey where you can tell us your color choice and any other info we need to get you the bike. </p><p> </p><p><b>What range can you get from the 17A battery?</b></p><p> </p><p>We use the same Panasonic cells that are in the Tesla Model S electric car. Due to their high energy density we’ve managed to get 612 watt hours into a relatively small battery pack. Watt hours are the figure you need to look at when figuring out how far an electric bike can go. The higher the watt hours, greater the range. Very few bikes feature a battery with such a high capacity as the FLX 17Ah battery. Combined with the more efficient mid motor we get 46 miles with the Roadster on full power.</p><p> </p><p><b>What about the 13A Battery?</b></p><p> </p><p>The 13Ah battery at 468 watt hours uses Samsung cells and is no slouch either. You can get around 35 miles in full power on the Roadster. The trail will be slightly less due to increased rolling resistance of the tires. </p><p> </p><p><b>Can I upgrade to a 17A battery?</b></p><p> </p><p>Yes, we will offer a battery upgrade and extra batteries later in the campaign. Lock in your earlybird price on the bike and we'll email you when the battery perks are available. </p><p> </p><p><b>I'm short/tall/heavy, can I ride it?</b></p><p> </p><p>We've tested the 19” frame with riders from 5'2” to 6'5” with no issues. Pete and Rob have been know to ride double on one bike, throttling up hills with over 360 lbs combined weight!</p><p> </p><p><b>Test Rides?</b></p><p> </p><p>Sorry, we're busy building bikes right now. Subscribe to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC13kWhYPjoYHfvfbgG2QjAA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FLX youtube</a> for some awesome footage of real people on these bikes. You can check our face</p><p> </p><p><b>Is there a warranty?</b></p><p> </p><p>Yes! We use high quality components and are in this for the long run. All FLX bikes are protected by a one year warranty. Any parts that break or go defective are covered. We will ship replacement parts free of charge in this case. Note this does not include rider damage.</p><p> </p><p><b>How do I get replacement parts?</b></p><p> </p><p>We'll be opening an online store on <a href=""http://flx.bike/shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://flx.bike</a> where you can purchase components, accessories and even bikes in the very near future. We're working hard to get these to you in the most efficient way possible.</p><p> </p><p><b>Where can FLX bikes be serviced?</b></p><p> </p><p>FLX bikes are designed to be very simple, and just like a normal bike. Any reputable bike shop will have the tools to work on a FLX and make any changes if needed. We will provide documentation and/or video of possible replacement processes to ensure quality work.</p><p> </p><p><b>What colors are available?</b></p><p> </p><p>Gloss white and matte black for now. We may incorporate a stretch goal for more colors.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><a name=""tech"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technical</a></h3><p><b>How much do they weigh?</b></p><p>FLX bikes are very lightweight considering the technology packed in. Their weights with battery are as follows:<br/>Roadster: 46 lbs<br/>Trail: 51 lbs<br/>Attack: 53 lbs</p><p> </p><p><b>How much does the battery weigh?</b></p><p> </p><p>FLX uses the highest capacity battery cells available. The battery pack weighs 6.6 pounds.</p><p> </p><p><b>How do you charge the battery and how long does it take?</b></p><p> </p><p>The Battery can be charged either on or off the bike. If you live in an apartment building you don’t need to lug it up all those stairs to charge it. Same thing at work, although this battery lasts so long you probably won’t need to bother with a charger in the office. It takes around 6 hours to charge with our 3A charger.</p><p> </p><p><b>Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world?</b></p><p> </p><p>Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V and uses the same power cable that desktop computers use. Works in every country. </p><p> </p><p><b>Can you charge the bike by pedaling to increase range?</b></p><p> </p><p>No, such a system defies the laws of physics and would decrease the overall range of the bike rather than increase it. Because the efficiency of dynamos and motors is only in the 80-90% range, such a system could only convert ~80% of the energy you put into pedaling into motion. On the other hand, if you simply used this energy to propel the bike, you can put almost 100% of that energy into motion. Put simply, the bike is simpler and will go further without this system. </p><p> </p><p><b>Why is your motor in the crank rather than in the rear hub like most electric bikes?</b></p><p> </p><p>A mid drive motor system is incredibly efficient. By providing power at the crank it takes full use of the mechanical advantage of the bike’s gearing. Mid motors are known for delivering higher performance and torque when compared to a similar powered traditional Hub Motor.</p><p>Taking advantage of the bike’s own gearing system multiplies the motor’s power up to 3.1 times. This makes it more efficient when climbing hills and also achieving top end speeds. Battery life is extended due to increased efficiency and it also centralizes weight distribution which most importantly means more air when hitting those jumps!</p><p>Admittedly we’re really biased towards mid motors and that’s the point. We did plenty of research on them before the bike even took form on a drawing board. We think they’re far superior and that’s why we use them on our bikes.</p><p> </p><p><b>Is there a water bottle mount?</b></p><p> </p><p>Yes, there are braze-ons on the seat tube of the Roadster and Trail for standard water bottle cages. The Attack has the same braze-ons under the down tube. </p><p> </p><p><b>Are there Eyelets for fenders?</b></p><p> </p><p>Yes, standard mounting eyelets for fenders front and rear.</p><p> </p><p><b>Will you sell a rear rack?</b></p><p> </p><p>There are mounting points for a rear rack and many aftermarket options will work. We also plan to offer a solution as a stretch goal, so tell your friends!</p><p> </p><p><b>Can you remove the wheels if you need to put it in a car?</b></p><p> </p><p>Absolutely. Both wheels are quick release and can be removed in approximately 25 seconds flat. Next...</p><p> </p><p><b>What happens if I get a Puncture?</b></p><p> </p><p>Go off road or ride high distances in the city and you get plenty of punctures right? Changing a flat on a FLX is exactly the same as on a standard bike. Hub motors make it way more complicated. Just saying.</p><p> </p><p><b>How much maintenance does the motor require?</b></p><p> </p><p>The motor is maintenance free. Our motor manufacturer has been making these types of motors for years so they’ve been thoroughly tested in the factory, in the field and with 1000’s of other customers. If needed the entire motor can also be removed and replaced simply by taking out a couple of bolts instead of dealing with the complexities of replacing a hub motor. Check it out. Nightmare.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><a name=""leg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Legal</a></h3><p><b>Will this comply with the laws in Europe/Australia/Mars?</b></p><p>We chose the Bofeili mid motor for its flexibility and high power output. While it can operate for extended periods close to its 650w peak output, the motor is rated 250w, which means it complies with stricter EU regulations. Motors up to 250w nominal power are legal in most countries. The speed limit can be programmed and the throttle can be removed very easily to comply with local laws.</p><p> </p><p><b>What’s the top speed of the Bike?</b></p><p> </p><p>FLX bikes can easily achieve 25mph, for legal reasons, above 25mph the motor cuts out and it’s down to the rider how fast they can pedal. The bikes all have a speedometer in the display so you can see exactly how fast that is. The speed limit in the LCD display can be programmed in about 1 minute to comply with local laws. For off road use only, the speed limit can be removed to reach speeds of up to 30mph. </p><p> </p><p><b>Do I need a special license to operate one?</b></p><p> </p><p>FLX bikes are legal and classified as an electric bike almost everywhere, and as such don't require a special license. There are a few jurisdictions with more specific laws and we recommend to check those before purchasing.</p><p> </p><p><b>Do I need to wear a helmet?</b></p><p> </p><p>They are required by law in some places and optional in other places.</p><p> </p><p><b>Why are the riders not wearing helmets?</b></p><p> </p><p>On one hand, helmets dramatically reduce fatal and long term head injuries from impact and it is advisable to wear them considering all the drivers texting around you! On the other hand, <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01785.x/abstract;jsessionid=387451180B51C5E7CB3D61DCA64E4176.f03t01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">studies show</a> that helmet laws can actually cause a large unintended negative health impact. We have no place to tell you how to ride, take the facts for what they are and make your own decision. Personally, we wear helmets when it makes sense for us.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><a name=""pas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Payments and Shipping</a></h3><p><b>How much is shipping?</b></p><p>Free shipping to the US, $200 USD to Canada and Mexico, $799 USD international shipping.</p><p> </p><p><b>Can I pick the bike up in SF and avoid the shipping charge?</b></p><p>Sorry, we'd love to meet you, but the bikes are shipped from our manufacturing partners by sea and land freight.

- According to reviewers, customers & fans 

""Top of the line. Best design I have seen in any electric bike.""- Darwin Cole (test rider & customer)""I have been researching for nearly 5 years, but never spent the money until the FLX Bike came along. And, now I'm sold! We have 2 bike on the way now!""- Nathan Long (happy customer x2)""I am so flxing excited about these bike.... I just bought 2 after meeting with Pete in SF... This bike is built like a tank and is incredibly well thought out. Its also the perfect size, handles like a dream and best of all it does NOT look like an electric bike.. I absolutely love that when they think of something to make better they simply do it, there is no excuse and to me that means that they are looking out for us.""- Peter Mainwald (test rider & customer x2)
This is unparalleled to anything I've ever been part of when it comes to any sort of purchase.. The attention to detail on each bike part is borderline insane! And myself being a perfectionist, I love it. It's odd but I feel that I literally underpaid for the bike just because of the labor involved in making sure everyone who purchases a bike is the exact same thing you guys have dreamed about making and you do not want to let not 1 single person down... Keep up the awesome work!- Rafael Astolpho (happy customer)
Holy crap! I thought I was a perfectionist. Dang. I continue to be blown away with your level of passion and work ethic. I'm telling everyone how inspiring team FLX is...  ;) thanks for all your hard work and attention to detail. Love to you.  - Maria Gianas﻿ (happy customer)

    FAQS
GeneralTechnicalLegalPayments and Shipping
 General Paypal won't accept my payment, what do I do?Good news, you can now buy your bike directly on the FLX website and checkout with any major Credit Card. Contact us at hello@flx.bike with any issues.   Are you hiring?Yes, we have several positions available. Check them out and apply here. Will the production bikes be exactly like the ones pictured? No. They will be even better. We have a few tweaks to make and reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your FLX bike even better. Since the photos were taken, we've already upgraded the motor from 540 to 650w, added a USB port in the display, changed Microshift gears for Shimano, and plan to make a couple other upgrades before your bike is ready! How do I choose the color? We're going to be announcing one or two more color choices before the end of the campaign. When the campaign ends, we'll send you a survey where you can tell us your color choice and any other info we need to get you the bike.  What range can you get from the 17A battery? We use the same Panasonic cells that are in the Tesla Model S electric car. Due to their high energy density we’ve managed to get 612 watt hours into a relatively small battery pack. Watt hours are the figure you need to look at when figuring out how far an electric bike can go. The higher the watt hours, greater the range. Very few bikes feature a battery with such a high capacity as the FLX 17Ah battery. Combined with the more efficient mid motor we get 46 miles with the Roadster on full power. What about the 13A Battery? The 13Ah battery at 468 watt hours uses Samsung cells and is no slouch either. You can get around 35 miles in full power on the Roadster. The trail will be slightly less due to increased rolling resistance of the tires.  Can I upgrade to a 17A battery? Yes, we will offer a battery upgrade and extra batteries later in the campaign. Lock in your earlybird price on the bike and we'll email you when the battery perks are available.  I'm short/tall/heavy, can I ride it? We've tested the 19” frame with riders from 5'2” to 6'5” with no issues. Pete and Rob have been know to ride double on one bike, throttling up hills with over 360 lbs combined weight! Test Rides? Sorry, we're busy building bikes right now. Subscribe to FLX youtube for some awesome footage of real people on these bikes. You can check our face Is there a warranty? Yes! We use high quality components and are in this for the long run. All FLX bikes are protected by a one year warranty. Any parts that break or go defective are covered. We will ship replacement parts free of charge in this case. Note this does not include rider damage. How do I get replacement parts? We'll be opening an online store on http://flx.bike where you can purchase components, accessories and even bikes in the very near future. We're working hard to get these to you in the most efficient way possible. Where can FLX bikes be serviced? FLX bikes are designed to be very simple, and just like a normal bike. Any reputable bike shop will have the tools to work on a FLX and make any changes if needed. We will provide documentation and/or video of possible replacement processes to ensure quality work. What colors are available? Gloss white and matte black for now. We may incorporate a stretch goal for more colors.   TechnicalHow much do they weigh?FLX bikes are very lightweight considering the technology packed in. Their weights with battery are as follows:Roadster: 46 lbsTrail: 51 lbsAttack: 53 lbs How much does the battery weigh? FLX uses the highest capacity battery cells available. The battery pack weighs 6.6 pounds. How do you charge the battery and how long does it take? The Battery can be charged either on or off the bike. If you live in an apartment building you don’t need to lug it up all those stairs to charge it. Same thing at work, although this battery lasts so long you probably won’t need to bother with a charger in the office. It takes around 6 hours to charge with our 3A charger. Will the charger work with 120V and 220V outlets around the world? Yes, the charger is rated 100-240V and uses the same power cable that desktop computers use. Works in every country.  Can you charge the bike by pedaling to increase range? No, such a system defies the laws of physics and would decrease the overall range of the bike rather than increase it. Because the efficiency of dynamos and motors is only in the 80-90% range, such a system could only convert ~80% of the energy you put into pedaling into motion. On the other hand, if you simply used this energy to propel the bike, you can put almost 100% of that energy into motion. Put simply, the bike is simpler and will go further without this system.  Why is your motor in the crank rather than in the rear hub like most electric bikes? A mid drive motor system is incredibly efficient. By providing power at the crank it takes full use of the mechanical advantage of the bike’s gearing. Mid motors are known for delivering higher performance and torque when compared to a similar powered traditional Hub Motor.Taking advantage of the bike’s own gearing system multiplies the motor’s power up to 3.1 times. This makes it more efficient when climbing hills and also achieving top end speeds. Battery life is extended due to increased efficiency and it also centralizes weight distribution which most importantly means more air when hitting those jumps!Admittedly we’re really biased towards mid motors and that’s the point. We did plenty of research on them before the bike even took form on a drawing board. We think they’re far superior and that’s why we use them on our bikes. Is there a water bottle mount? Yes, there are braze-ons on the seat tube of the Roadster and Trail for standard water bottle cages. The Attack has the same braze-ons under the down tube.  Are there Eyelets for fenders? Yes, standard mounting eyelets for fenders front and rear. Will you sell a rear rack? There are mounting points for a rear rack and many aftermarket options will work. We also plan to offer a solution as a stretch goal, so tell your friends! Can you remove the wheels if you need to put it in a car? Absolutely. Both wheels are quick release and can be removed in approximately 25 seconds flat. Next... What happens if I get a Puncture? Go off road or ride high distances in the city and you get plenty of punctures right? Changing a flat on a FLX is exactly the same as on a standard bike. Hub motors make it way more complicated. Just saying. How much maintenance does the motor require? The motor is maintenance free. Our motor manufacturer has been making these types of motors for years so they’ve been thoroughly tested in the factory, in the field and with 1000’s of other customers. If needed the entire motor can also be removed and replaced simply by taking out a couple of bolts instead of dealing with the complexities of replacing a hub motor. Check it out. Nightmare.   LegalWill this comply with the laws in Europe/Australia/Mars?We chose the Bofeili mid motor for its flexibility and high power output. While it can operate for extended periods close to its 650w peak output, the motor is rated 250w, which means it complies with stricter EU regulations. Motors up to 250w nominal power are legal in most countries. The speed limit can be programmed and the throttle can be removed very easily to comply with local laws. What’s the top speed of the Bike? FLX bikes can easily achieve 25mph, for legal reasons, above 25mph the motor cuts out and it’s down to the rider how fast they can pedal. The bikes all have a speedometer in the display so you can see exactly how fast that is. The speed limit in the LCD display can be programmed in about 1 minute to comply with local laws. For off road use only, the speed limit can be removed to reach speeds of up to 30mph.  Do I need a special license to operate one? FLX bikes are legal and classified as an electric bike almost everywhere, and as such don't require a special license. There are a few jurisdictions with more specific laws and we recommend to check those before purchasing. Do I need to wear a helmet? They are required by law in some places and optional in other places. Why are the riders not wearing helmets? On one hand, helmets dramatically reduce fatal and long term head injuries from impact and it is advisable to wear them considering all the drivers texting around you! On the other hand, studies show that helmet laws can actually cause a large unintended negative health impact. We have no place to tell you how to ride, take the facts for what they are and make your own decision. Personally, we wear helmets when it makes sense for us.   Payments and ShippingHow much is shipping?Free shipping to the US, $200 USD to Canada and Mexico, $799 USD international shipping. Can I pick the bike up in SF and avoid the shipping charge?Sorry, we'd love to meet you, but the bikes are shipped from our manufacturing partners by sea and land freight. We have to pay shipping on every bike.  When does it ship? We're shipping now! Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT? The backer is responsible, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. It is 0% in the US and varies internationally. You can check this comprehensive list to get started. Is there financing? Yes, you can order your bike on our shop and checkout with Paypal Credit (Bill Me Later) to finance the purchase. The terms are very generous!Can I get a refund?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here.",38.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h3>GoLite • EZ-EV Building • Creating a Light EV Future</h3>
<p>The founders of GoLite have 80 years of combined experience in light electric vehicles. With 60% of all car trips <span style=""color: rgb(26, 117, 255);line-height: 26px;"">less than</span> 6 miles, we know local transportation is better on bikes or simple efficient electric vehicles. With our deep experience, we’ve mostly seen negative experiences with big-money venture capital, which focuses on scale, not quality. While we have designs for many types of light EVs, our first model is a hip urban electric vehicle. We aim to reach the marketplace in a far less expensive and more reasonable manner, we hope to inspire other upcoming light EV makers there is a more accessible pathway to commercialization for them too.</p>

<h3>Help Us Democratize Vehicle Design + Manufacturing</h3>
<p>We are looking for community support to bring our first model to market, and demonstrate commercialization of light electric vehicles is easier than most might imagine. While conventional thinking would require $3 million in venture capital funding, we aim to show we can make the journey with only 1% of those funds. Our experience tells us it can be done.</p>
<p>But we need your help to succeed on this path. We aim to complete our first Boxer (urban electric delivery vehicle) prototype with your support. When completed, the prototype will also serve as our sales model, to secure initial orders from customers, many are expected to be <span style=""color: rgb(26, 117, 255);line-height: 26px;"">small business</span> owners that want to deliver their goods to local customers in a 100% electric vehicle. (And we know the delivery business is exploding in these new Covid-19 times). Those expected orders are all that will be needed to set-up our first simple ""micro-factory"", with several new welders and assemblers on our team. </p>
<p>We are offering a number of unique perks for contributors that are fueling our dreams for wonderful local mobility + movement, and demonstrating the future of democratized vehicle design + manufacturing. </p>
<p>Should we secure less funding than desired, all money will go to the prototype / first sales model build and thus require additional time to reach production.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>We Got This</h3>
<p>As an automobile-dependant nation, we have reached an exciting new time where transportation is becoming highly fragmented - created all new vehicle categories - which offer to improve our communities and cities in a major way. </p>
<p>The GoLite founders have seen a lot in our many years of experience. We’ve watched business leaders from other industries enter the transportation space, and in one case raise over $800 million from inexperienced venture capital, and then lose every dollar in 3 years. If we aim to rely on this approach to funding, our communities and cities will suffer for it. We can continue to watch companies with business leaders, tight with VC funders continue to raise money and deliver very little with it, or we can back the designers and engineers with the knowledge and passion, and help them go to market directly. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute, we would appreciate any ideas of potential business customers in your city that may want to deliver their goods 100% electric in our Boxer delivery vehicle. Also, as mentioned, we seek to identify a business leader for our company, that will play a central role in building GoLite into a strong and meaningful company.

<p>""Warp Speed"" anyone? (ok, so if you haven't guessed by now, we are a little techie!)</p>
<p>Our technology is based on a new composition (not based on Barium Titanate). Our new composition has created an advanced new crystal structure capable of massive energy storage. </p>
<p>When comparing our single layer ceramic disc capacitor (think of a capacitor as the container that holds electrical energy) to an industry standard Barium Titanate single layer ceramic disc capacitor (similar size), the results are phenomenal and exponentially greater!</p>

<p>If you're a science techie like we are and want to read the wiki about capacitance <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here</a>.</p>
<h4>What does our discovery mean for you?</h4>
<p>Our technology holds more electrical energy in a smaller, safer and more compact unit. Every battery and capacitor manufacturer should be able to take our technology and incorporate it into their products. Batteries and products using capacitors (which are in 99% of electronics) would now have massive amounts of stored electrical energy. For example, your cell phone battery that currently lasts 10 - 48 hours, could be replaced with our ZephiQ technology and would NOW last you over 350 hours.</p>
<p>The tables below compare just one of the many applications in our daily lives - external chargers (cell phone / tablet charging and laptop charging).</p>
<p>Compare the number of cell phone / tablet charges that will be available in the <strong>ZephiQ U</strong> vs. other products on the market <u>advertising the largest mAh capacity</u>. In addition the <strong>ZephiQ U</strong> will be <strong><u>80% smaller </u></strong>than these other products.</p>

<h2><font color=""#00cc00"">///<font color=""#606060""> Our progress</font></font></h2>
<p>We have discovered and tested the prototype materials and formulas.  We are ready to implement the Tier II R&amp;D project plan.  The next steps include advanced R&amp;D with additional equipment and a scale up of our facility and staff in order to optimize the materials' scientific properties.  Once we optimize the materials and formulas, we will prepare it for manufacturing.  </p>
<p>We are confident that the R&amp;D will be successful and have a positive global impact. Our team’s experience in chemistry, materials science, electrical engineering, manufacturing, and research and development will help us bring this discovery to the world.</p>
<h2><font color=""#00cc00"">///<font color=""#606060""> Use of proceeds</font></font></h2>
<p>We are looking to raise these funds to accelerate the R&amp;D timeline. Imagine looking at a world changing technology and saying <strong>“I helped support that project”!</strong> Your support will help us cover the cost of additional R&amp;D equipment, materials and components, testing, and operations.</p>
<p>We have invested our own funds over the past 3 years for Tier I R&amp;D to develop and prove that this technology is realistic.  We're confident in our prototype materials and in asking for your help.</p>
<h2><font color=""#00cc00"">///<font color=""#606060""> Our values and mission</font></font></h2>
<p>The ZephiQ project is very important to us. We believe this technology will change people’s lives and help the environment.  Our vision is to bring the imagination and dreams of the future to present day reality with new ways of storing electrical energy.  We believe all things are possible to those who say <strong>""What if? Why not? Let's try!""</strong> Our Mission is to develop state-of-the-art technological advancements that benefit all. </p>
<h2><font color=""#00cc00"">///<font color=""#606060""> About us</font></font></h2>
<p>The ZephiQ Project is brought to you by Crystalline Energy Research Corporation (CER). CER was founded to conduct dedicated research and development on innovative and revolutionary solid state ceramic hybrid composite capacitor materials.  Specifically, CER will focus on the material's use and applications for electrical energy storage components and systems as well as new advanced capacitors.  Connected with this R&amp;D are increases in electrical energy storage efficiencies for electric vehicles and the associated charging infrastructures.</p>

<h2><font color=""#00cc00"">///<font color=""#606060""> FAQ</font></font></h2>
<p>We are happy to answer questions about this project. Well except some like: What is it made of? How do you make it? Can I have a sample? To those questions our response is: Sorry, we wish we could, but we have to keep that a secret.</p>
<p><u><strong>What is difference between a battery and ceramic capacitor?</strong></u></p>
<p>A battery is a chemical generator that produces electrical energy as a result of chemical activity or a chemical reaction. A capacitor is an electrical device capable of storing electrical energy in the form of electrons. A capacitor is not a chemical generator.</p>
<p><u><strong>Why does your new ceramic capacitor have the capability to store more electrical energy than regular ceramic capacitors?</strong></u></p>
<p>Our new ceramic capacitor has the capability to store greater amounts of electrical energy because it has a massively higher dielectric constant than regular ceramic capacitors. One could even think of our new ceramic capacitor having a hyper dielectric constant.</p>
<p><u><strong>What is the dielectric constant?</strong></u></p>
<p>The dielectric constant is a unitless number that represents the capability of an insulating material, like that found in a ceramic capacitor, to store electric charge when a voltage is applied to the capacitor. The greater the dielectric constant, the greater the amount of electric energy able to be stored.</p>
<p><u><strong>Can a ceramic capacitor catch fire or leak?</strong></u></p>
<p>No, a ceramic capacitor is not able to catch fire or leak.</p>
<p><u><strong>How long will a ceramic capacitor last when it is run through charging and discharging cycles?</strong></u></p>
<p>Ceramic capacitors can last longer than 10 to 20 years in charging and discharging cycles.</p>
<p><u><strong>How is your new ceramic capacitor different from an ultra-capacitor?</strong></u></p>
<p>Our new ceramic capacitor operates in a temperature range of -70°C up to at least +250°C. Ultra-capacitors only operate in a temperature range of -30°C to +90°C and can only be charged with about 5 volts maximum. Our new ceramic capacitor will be able to be charged with thousands of volts when the materials and formulas are optimized. </p>
<p><u><strong>What power standards does ZephiQ work with?</strong></u></p>
<p>Primary power in is 120 VAC. </p>
<p><u><strong>How will I charge my phone if it does not have a micro USB?</strong></u></p>
<p>You will want to purchase the ZephiQ USB or the ZephiQ Laptop with built-in USB and use the USB charging cord provided with your device.</p>
<p><u><strong>How will I charge my Laptop?</strong></u></p>
<p>The ZephiQ laptop models will come with a universal charging cord and 6 different sized power tips. Select the tip that fits your laptop and simply attached the tip to the universal charging cord. Then plug one end of the charging cord into the ZephiQ and the other end into your laptop.</p>

We think this discovery might just be up there with technology breakthroughs from Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. 
 
Hey, what can we say - we're scientists, we're excited!
The ZephiQ project brought to you by Crystalline Energy Research Corporation (CER) is more than just offering chargers capable of superior electrical energy storage. It is about transforming what is possible with electrical energy storage. Once our technology is fully developed it will radically improve people's lives and industries relying on batteries and stored energy. Products with our technology inside will store phenomenally more electrical energy in a drastically smaller size!
This project will have a very positive global impact and we need your support.  In exchange for your help we would like to offer you the ZephiQ chargers with the superior technology only we can put inside.

 What could you imagine with superior electrical energy storage in any device?
...........................................................................................................................
 
/// How does our technology compare to today's energy storage technology
""Warp Speed"" anyone? (ok, so if you haven't guessed by now, we are a little techie!)
Our technology is based on a new composition (not based on Barium Titanate). Our new composition has created an advanced new crystal structure capable of massive energy storage. 
When comparing our single layer ceramic disc capacitor (think of a capacitor as the container that holds electrical energy) to an industry standard Barium Titanate single layer ceramic disc capacitor (similar size), the results are phenomenal and exponentially greater!

If you're a science techie like we are and want to read the wiki about capacitance click here.
What does our discovery mean for you?
Our technology holds more electrical energy in a smaller, safer and more compact unit. Every battery and capacitor manufacturer should be able to take our technology and incorporate it into their products. Batteries and products using capacitors (which are in 99% of electronics) would now have massive amounts of stored electrical energy. For example, your cell phone battery that currently lasts 10 - 48 hours, could be replaced with our ZephiQ technology and would NOW last you over 350 hours.
The tables below compare just one of the many applications in our daily lives - external chargers (cell phone / tablet charging and laptop charging).
Compare the number of cell phone / tablet charges that will be available in the ZephiQ U vs. other products on the market advertising the largest mAh capacity. In addition the ZephiQ U will be 80% smaller than these other products.

/// FAQ
We are happy to answer questions about this project. Well except some like: What is it made of? How do you make it? Can I have a sample? To those questions our response is: Sorry, we wish we could, but we have to keep that a secret.
What is difference between a battery and ceramic capacitor?
A battery is a chemical generator that produces electrical energy as a result of chemical activity or a chemical reaction. A capacitor is an electrical device capable of storing electrical energy in the form of electrons. A capacitor is not a chemical generator.
Why does your new ceramic capacitor have the capability to store more electrical energy than regular ceramic capacitors?
Our new ceramic capacitor has the capability to store greater amounts of electrical energy because it has a massively higher dielectric constant than regular ceramic capacitors. One could even think of our new ceramic capacitor having a hyper dielectric constant.
What is the dielectric constant?
The dielectric constant is a unitless number that represents the capability of an insulating material, like that found in a ceramic capacitor, to store electric charge when a voltage is applied to the capacitor. The greater the dielectric constant, the greater the amount of electric energy able to be stored.
Can a ceramic capacitor catch fire or leak?
No, a ceramic capacitor is not able to catch fire or leak.
How long will a ceramic capacitor last when it is run through charging and discharging cycles?
Ceramic capacitors can last longer than 10 to 20 years in charging and discharging cycles.
How is your new ceramic capacitor different from an ultra-capacitor?
Our new ceramic capacitor operates in a temperature range of -70°C up to at least +250°C. Ultra-capacitors only operate in a temperature range of -30°C to +90°C and can only be charged with about 5 volts maximum. Our new ceramic capacitor will be able to be charged with thousands of volts when the materials and formulas are optimized. 
What power standards does ZephiQ work with?
Primary power in is 120 VAC. 
How will I charge my phone if it does not have a micro USB?
You will want to purchase the ZephiQ USB or the ZephiQ Laptop with built-in USB and use the USB charging cord provided with your device.
How will I charge my Laptop?
The ZephiQ laptop models will come with a universal charging cord and 6 different sized power tips. Select the tip that fits your laptop and simply attached the tip to the universal charging cord. Then plug one end of the charging cord into the ZephiQ and the other end into your laptop.
How do I recharge the ZephiQ?
Simply use the charging cord that came with your ZephiQ. Plug one end into the ZephiQ and then the other end into the wall outlet.
How long does it take to recharge the ZephiQ?
If the unit has been fully discharged, it may take an overnight charge (12 - 18 hours) to fully recharge.

<p>
</p><h2><b>New record-breaking smart e-Drive for e-Bikes,
carrier tricycles, messenger bikes, spinning bikes etc.</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>Founding for Growth!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We intend to set up a large-scale
series production, - at the same time enhancing Smart Control by full
integration to your mobile or laptop at home.  As a private, team-owned
development company we are currently looking for an independent crowd-based funding
for this challenge. Be part of this incredible success story and contribute! The
funding will be used for building up a assembly line and a material stock for
the planned &gt;1000 motors.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>Test-Winning Technology from
Switzerland and Germany!</h2>
<p></p>
<p>After years of development, passing all relevant tests and approvals and
after proving the durability in professional carrier tricycles (as used by Pizza
delivery services and many others) with thousands of kilometers (in Gobax bikes),
the ACRON e-Drive is now ready for the next step; -to move into large-scale
series production. <br/><br/>
The development of the ACRON-drive was a joint team-cooperation between a Swiss
team (Electragil - engine hardware) and a German team (Pro Design - controller, 
sensor technology).</p>
<p>The revolutionary concept of the ACRON e-Drive beat all competitors by
lengths at its first market introduction
and won a series of tests in many renowned European bicycle journals! The ACRON e-drive even beat no lesser than the current market leader - BOSCH !.</p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Natural Riding,
a new Experience in Riding Dynamics</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Core of the cutting-edge -technology of the ACRON-drive is the newly
developed electronically controlled asynchronous motor. The most significant
development being the newly developed electronic control featuringinfinite torque
measurement and control. </p>
<p><i>“First time I was riding the Silent-e with the
ACRON-drive, I was completely astonished! <br/>
I took a short tour through a village at high speed(&gt;30mph) and on a steep up-hill
passage,for the first time in my life had to brake in the turns whilegoing uphill!  It was really
an amazing experience, but I actually never had the feeling that I was being supported
by an electric motor. The bike only feels like you are having the best physical
condition of your life. And another great
thing I experienced was, that the ACRON controller gives you the ability to program
a training workout with a specified supporting profile. <br/>
“ M. Ziegler, Germany</i></p>
<p>Starting to ride the Silent-e you hear no noise – and you feel no
uncomfortable pushy motor activity – you only have the feeling that your physical
performance is incredibly good, i.e. that YOU are doing extremely well! The
ACRON is the one and only e-Drive with a seamless transition between muscle
power and ful e-driven biking. With a range of up to 700 Watts (depending on
the type of e-Bike, usage profile and local legal regulations) it is an incredibly
rewarding riding experience andfun just
the same for elderly people, young sportive bikers, mountain bikers and people
who use the bike professionally (e.g. messengers and delivery services).</p>
<p>
</p><h2>The ACRON smart e-Motor </h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289383/files/20140103093807-ACRON_smart_e-Mobility.jpg?1388770687"" src="""" style=""width: 348.35px; height: 567px;""/></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The ACRON motor forms the basis for a large number of different e-bike solutions
on the market. Its compact and powerful technology in combination with the
smart control opens a totally new driving experience and an abundance of new applications.</p>
<p>The e-motor is located on the left side of the bottom bracket enclosed in a
cast-aluminium housing. Surprisingly enough, this motor is not a direct drive
but a planetary gear layout designed for improvement of power and comfort. The Swiss
precision planetary gear works almost without noise and leads to an
astonishingly (clockwork-like) smooth function of the motor. </p>
<p>The main motivation behind the sophisticated sensor technology was the idea
to realize the same comfort while driving an e-Bike ‑just like driving a high-performance
standard bike. In this extraordinary bike concept load transmission is direct; -working
on a 10-gear sprocket cassette on the rear wheel (range 11-36), in order to cover all relevant operating
speeds.</p>
<p>The ACRON motor is the first commercial solution in this field with an
integrated Energy-Bus protocol which opens a new world in e-mobility. The
energy bus is able to automatically control an unlimited number of parallel batteries,
-plug and play- and thereby optimizes the energy usage of all available power sources.</p>
<p>The torque sensor is a key development within the ACRON project, ) computing
approx. 280.000(!) measurements per full turn! This leads to coverage of the
smallest change in force and leg position and thereby the resulting reaction of
motor in real time mode(!). The biker obviously cannot feel these incredibly fast
reactions of the motor and as a result, it feels like his own performance. The
motor usually delivers 250W and 40Nm torque, but for selected applications it is
designed to deliver up to 700W /100Nm torque.</p>
<p>Noteworthy enough is the use of two extremely slim Li-Ion batteries, which are
fitted in a cradle on the left and right side of the center frame. These
powerful companions operate in single or dual mode, each with 310Wh /36V. Charging
time to full recharge is 2.5h with any energy bus charging station. </p>
<p>The ACRON motor successfully passed a 30mph endurance test and has also successfully
passed the rigid German Motor Vehicles Ministry (KBA) homologation for carrier
bikes and is ready for many other application in Europe, North America and Asia.</p>
<p>
</p><h1>Google Glass integration as Additional Feature</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The system architecture of the ACRON electronic propulsions systemhas the unique
possibility to integrate future Google Glass applications, e.g to obtain information
about the current performance, the most energy-efficient roads or many other informations,
such as close-by charging stations; or even
to locate roads especially suited for your personal workout scheme. First
applications will be developed in 2014; ‑preferrably in close cooperation with <a href=""https://plus.google.com/104994566444569588739/posts/NU2GSda5UJR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google
Glass App - developers</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><h1>First Products are Ready to enter the Market Now!</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The ultimate e-Bike on the Market: The Silent-<i>e</i> with ACRON smart
e-Drive!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/289385/files/20140103093928-silent-e_BIKE-TradeShow.png.jpg?1388770768"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h2>From smart City Bikes to “Fully”
e-Mountain Bikes</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Silent-e was first presented on the EUROBIKE 2013 and is ready to be ordered
and sold in 2014. The bike is a direct result of Thomas Klotzbuecher’s many years’
experience as bike-developer. Thomas was responsible for the Merida product
lines in previous years. The team around Thomas designed the frame specifically
for an e-Drive -taking advantage of this new dynamic concept for a perfect riding
experience!</p>
<p>Based on the success of the first user of the ACRON drive, the Gobax -brand
(<b>Eurobike Award 2010, BrandNewAward
2012, Founder Price Baden-Wuerttemberg</b>), the development of the Silent-e
now offers proven cutting-edge-technology.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>
<br/>
Team Competence for in the Silent-e Project</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The Gobax-team is well-known in the biker scene, in consequencea guarantee factor
for future developments. Robert Dorn, owner of Gobax and Thomas Klotzbuecher as
product manager and developer for the same company were part of the most professional
bike development teams in the past few years. </p>
<p>
</p><h2>X-Intersected Tubes a special Innovation</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The stunningly different frame of the Silent-e is a result of the
aforementioned joint competence, which was developed on the one hand as a unisex design and for
high stiffness and safety / comfort on the other. Key feature of the new frame is
the massive main tube,-playfully intersected twice by the slimmer upper tube.
This remarkable concept leads to an extremely stiff interconnection between rear and front
part of the bike, which is absolutely necessary to cope with the new motor’s high
output.. All of these technologies were first successfully introduced (and
proven!) in professional Gobax carrier bikes.</p>
<p>Other high-tech features are a result of downhill offroad racing: massive
machined parts for length adjustment, as a base for different derailer and gear
equipment, professional front forks with massive 32mm diameter tubes as an
answer to the most recent safety requirements as well as high performance hydraulic disk brakes with
203mm diameter.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, this bike was designed especially for integration of a
powerful, highly dynamic e-Drive featuring
the technical state-of-the-art of professional biking. Although the Silent-e may
be regarded “merely ” as a general biking solution for the average biker, it’s feasibility
for both, a professional “fully” mountain bike or a racing bike is obvious. .</p>
<p>The company’s current pipeline includes the “<b>Silent Wave</b>”, “<b>Silent Surfer</b>“,
“<b>Silent Transformer</b>“ and the “<b>Silent Racer</b>”.</p>

development being the newly developed electronic control featuringinfinite torque
measurement and control. 
“First time I was riding the Silent-e with the
ACRON-drive, I was completely astonished! 
I took a short tour through a village at high speed(>30mph) and on a steep up-hill
passage,for the first time in my life had to brake in the turns whilegoing uphill!  It was really
an amazing experience, but I actually never had the feeling that I was being supported
by an electric motor. The bike only feels like you are having the best physical
condition of your life. And another great
thing I experienced was, that the ACRON controller gives you the ability to program
a training workout with a specified supporting profile. 
“ M. Ziegler, Germany
Starting to ride the Silent-e you hear no noise – and you feel no
uncomfortable pushy motor activity – you only have the feeling that your physical
performance is incredibly good, i.e. that YOU are doing extremely well! The
ACRON is the one and only e-Drive with a seamless transition between muscle
power and ful e-driven biking. With a range of up to 700 Watts (depending on
the type of e-Bike, usage profile and local legal regulations) it is an incredibly
rewarding riding experience andfun just
the same for elderly people, young sportive bikers, mountain bikers and people
who use the bike professionally (e.g. messengers and delivery services).

The ACRON smart e-Motor 

The ACRON motor forms the basis for a large number of different e-bike solutions
on the market. Its compact and powerful technology in combination with the
smart control opens a totally new driving experience and an abundance of new applications.
The e-motor is located on the left side of the bottom bracket enclosed in a
cast-aluminium housing. Surprisingly enough, this motor is not a direct drive
but a planetary gear layout designed for improvement of power and comfort. The Swiss
precision planetary gear works almost without noise and leads to an
astonishingly (clockwork-like) smooth function of the motor. 
The main motivation behind the sophisticated sensor technology was the idea
to realize the same comfort while driving an e-Bike ‑just like driving a high-performance
standard bike. In this extraordinary bike concept load transmission is direct; -working
on a 10-gear sprocket cassette on the rear wheel (range 11-36), in order to cover all relevant operating
speeds.
The ACRON motor is the first commercial solution in this field with an
integrated Energy-Bus protocol which opens a new world in e-mobility. The
energy bus is able to automatically control an unlimited number of parallel batteries,
-plug and play- and thereby optimizes the energy usage of all available power sources.
The torque sensor is a key development within the ACRON project, ) computing
approx. 280.000(!) measurements per full turn! This leads to coverage of the
smallest change in force and leg position and thereby the resulting reaction of
motor in real time mode(!). The biker obviously cannot feel these incredibly fast
reactions of the motor and as a result, it feels like his own performance. The
motor usually delivers 250W and 40Nm torque, but for selected applications it is
designed to deliver up to 700W /100Nm torque.
Noteworthy enough is the use of two extremely slim Li-Ion batteries, which are
fitted in a cradle on the left and right side of the center frame. These
powerful companions operate in single or dual mode, each with 310Wh /36V. Charging
time to full recharge is 2.5h with any energy bus charging station. 
The ACRON motor successfully passed a 30mph endurance test and has also successfully
passed the rigid German Motor Vehicles Ministry (KBA) homologation for carrier
bikes and is ready for many other application in Europe, North America and Asia.

Google Glass integration as Additional Feature

The system architecture of the ACRON electronic propulsions systemhas the unique
possibility to integrate future Google Glass applications, e.g to obtain information
about the current performance, the most energy-efficient roads or many other informations,
such as close-by charging stations; or even
to locate roads especially suited for your personal workout scheme. First
applications will be developed in 2014; ‑preferrably in close cooperation with Google
Glass App - developers. 

First Products are Ready to enter the Market Now!

The ultimate e-Bike on the Market: The Silent-e with ACRON smart
e-Drive!From smart City Bikes to “Fully”
e-Mountain Bikes

The Silent-e was first presented on the EUROBIKE 2013 and is ready to be ordered
and sold in 2014. The bike is a direct result of Thomas Klotzbuecher’s many years’
experience as bike-developer. Thomas was responsible for the Merida product
lines in previous years. The team around Thomas designed the frame specifically
for an e-Drive -taking advantage of this new dynamic concept for a perfect riding
experience!
Based on the success of the first user of the ACRON drive, the Gobax -brand
(Eurobike Award 2010, BrandNewAward
2012, Founder Price Baden-Wuerttemberg), the development of the Silent-e
now offers proven cutting-edge-technology.



Team Competence for in the Silent-e Project

The Gobax-team is well-known in the biker scene, in consequencea guarantee factor
for future developments. Robert Dorn, owner of Gobax and Thomas Klotzbuecher as
product manager and developer for the same company were part of the most professional
bike development teams in the past few years. 

X-Intersected Tubes a special Innovation

The stunningly different frame of the Silent-e is a result of the
aforementioned joint competence, which was developed on the one hand as a unisex design and for
high stiffness and safety / comfort on the other. Key feature of the new frame is
the massive main tube,-playfully intersected twice by the slimmer upper tube.
This remarkable concept leads to an extremely stiff interconnection between rear and front
part of the bike, which is absolutely necessary to cope with the new motor’s high
output.. All of these technologies were first successfully introduced (and
proven!) in professional Gobax carrier bikes.
Other high-tech features are a result of downhill offroad racing: massive
machined parts for length adjustment, as a base for different derailer and gear
equipment, professional front forks with massive 32mm diameter tubes as an
answer to the most recent safety requirements as well as high performance hydraulic disk brakes with
203mm diameter.
To sum it all up, this bike was designed especially for integration of a
powerful, highly dynamic e-Drive featuring
the technical state-of-the-art of professional biking. Although the Silent-e may
be regarded “merely ” as a general biking solution for the average biker, it’s feasibility
for both, a professional “fully” mountain bike or a racing bike is obvious. .
The company’s current pipeline includes the “Silent Wave”, “Silent Surfer“,
“Silent Transformer“ and the “Silent Racer”.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>41 years ago (1980-1981), my grandfather Laurentiu Moldovan, a former professional rally car driver and Guinness World Record holder for the longest career as a motor racing driver, built and raced the first Formula Easter (single-seater race car) in Romania. The LGM1 was built while Romania was under communist leadership, making it difficult to access resources to complete such a project. His love for cars and racing manifested itself into the determination to build a vehicle that he could race during this difficult time in Romanian history. </p>
<p>41 years later, former Romanian professional racing car driver and car journalist Edwin Keleti, discovered the remains of the LGM1 and set out to restore it to its original form. The restoration began in November 2020 and has been progressing everyday since. However, in order for the LGM1 to be restored completely, Edwin needs an additional €10,000 (approx. $15,000 CAD). Approximately €3000 will be given to the welder who has graciously helped Edwin throughout the project - free of charge. The remainder will be used for materials.</p>
<p>We have 41 days to fund the restoration of a 41-year-old race car!</p>

<p><b>Dennis</b>: This device is way ahead of the curve and has competitors in this market beat.</p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>Jörg</b>: The Electric Trikke is the only electric vehicle that combines
sport and fun with personal transport. No other electric vehicle is so agile,
fast, light and flexible. All our customers, whether for business or pleasure
are very satisfied with their Trikke electric. And even if the battery is
empty, you can continue your journey with body movement. No other electric
vehicle offers this opportunity! We love our E-Trikke ;-)</p>
<p></p>
<b>Chris</b>: Makes your commute the favorite part of your day...</div><div><br/></div><div>
<b>Wilson</b>: <span>I use the battery for tough uphills, wind,
and fatigue. I so enjoy the feeling of speed when using the electric motor.
It's a thrill I didn't experience on my T-8 unless coming down on hills.
Difference is I can get the ""need for speed"" at any time.</span>
</div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span><b>Bill</b>: I love it because I can use it to do some
intense exercise, or go over the Brooklyn bridge!!! How cool is that or even go
to my dentist...</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div>
<p><b>Douglass:</b>There is nothing like a little power assist when you just
don't feel like getting out on your manual model. So much fun and great for
bombing hills.</p>
<p><b>Dennis</b>: I’m using mine to save gas, especially to
run errands around town. <span>It is by far, the smartest, most economical and coolest vehicle
I've ever found. I can ride the bike paths here on the Vineyard and I must say,
I have no trouble negotiating traffic while in Boston or Cambridge. I'm addicted to its
intuitive ride. It turns on a dime and gives you a nickel back! The
""wow"" factor of passers by is also adoring. The other MAJOR factor is
that you do not have to use the ""juice"" to make it go. You'll get a
full body exercise rocking &amp; rolling it. I like to mix it up, using the
throttle to augment my body &amp; maintain speed to maximize battery life.  Remember: if the battery quits you can still get home.</span></p>
<p><b>Cheryl</b>: The movement. Power to go anywhere, nearly
effortless, yet a great workout. Is there any other competition??? Needed more
FUN in my life. Trikke delivered!</p>
<b>Roger: </b>The Tribred Pon-e is handy for 'Major
Events' where you have to find parking space BLOCKS (or even miles) away. Just
unfold it and cruise (with all your stuff) to the site. It's also great for hitting all the 'hot spots' at Tailgate Parties! When I have multiple stops downtown or at the beach, I bring my electric Trikke along. I park ONCE, and use it to get my chores done in HALF the TIME, while not having to fight the traffic or look for additional parking. Just wish I could use the Trikke 'inside' the stores as
well.....Humm, maybe one of those Blue Plackards with the wheelchair.....is the
Ticket! <span>Plus: while an E-Bike
is a ""Pain in the 'tookus'""; the Tribred Pon-e is
""Up-Standing"" FUN!</span><br/>
</div><div>
<p><b>FAQs</b></p>
<p><b>How
fast does it go? </b>For a rider of 175 lbs (80 kgs)
top speed will be about 15 mph (24 kph) on the flats.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How far
can I go on a charge?  </b>On electric-power alone, range is approximately 11
miles/charge on the 6.6 Ah battery that comes with the Freedom. If you upgrade
to the 9Ah battery the range increases to approximately 15 miles. Some choose
to get an extra battery as well to go further. Add your own carving propulsion and you could double that and get a killer workout.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Do I
have to carve turns to make it go?</b> Nope. Carving
turns <i>can</i> make it go farther and
faster and propel you without using the motor, but you can just cruise on all
electric too.</p>
<p><b>Is
the battery removable? </b>Yep. You just twist the
key all the way to the left and pull it straight up off the guide rail. </p>
<p><b>How
long does it take to recharge the battery? </b>A
full recharge takes 4 hours from empty.</p>
<p><b>How
do I recharge the battery? </b>It comes with a
charger that plugs into the wall outlet and into the battery.</p>
<p><b>What
is the weight limit?</b> We set the weight limit at
200 lbs (91 kgs). It will carry heavier riders, but we caution against heavy
riders heading straight up steeper hills or doing jumps as this could damage
the motor or the frame. </p>
<p><b>What
is the warranty?</b> Our warranty is one year from
receipt of the vehicle for any manufacturing defects.</p>

What you've seen in the photos and videos have been prototypes. Below are some renderings and the specs of the final product. 








SPECIFICATIONS:

Perks:
Freedom Wing Trucker's Hat:                                       
Freedom logo T-Shirt (please let us know male or female and your desired size)
The rest of the perks are Freedom electric carving vehicles... We think you know what those look like by now ;)Rider testimonials above and below are of our earlier models (pre new, improved hub motor and controller and better price)
Jenard: I use it to get to work. I park blocks away to get
the free parking. 

Frank: Poetry In Motion
Dennis: This device is way ahead of the curve and has competitors in this market beat.

Jörg: The Electric Trikke is the only electric vehicle that combines
sport and fun with personal transport. No other electric vehicle is so agile,
fast, light and flexible. All our customers, whether for business or pleasure
are very satisfied with their Trikke electric. And even if the battery is
empty, you can continue your journey with body movement. No other electric
vehicle offers this opportunity! We love our E-Trikke ;-)

Chris: Makes your commute the favorite part of your day...
Wilson: I use the battery for tough uphills, wind,
and fatigue. I so enjoy the feeling of speed when using the electric motor.
It's a thrill I didn't experience on my T-8 unless coming down on hills.
Difference is I can get the ""need for speed"" at any time.
Bill: I love it because I can use it to do some
intense exercise, or go over the Brooklyn bridge!!! How cool is that or even go
to my dentist...
Douglass:There is nothing like a little power assist when you just
don't feel like getting out on your manual model. So much fun and great for
bombing hills.
Dennis: I’m using mine to save gas, especially to
run errands around town. It is by far, the smartest, most economical and coolest vehicle
I've ever found. I can ride the bike paths here on the Vineyard and I must say,
I have no trouble negotiating traffic while in Boston or Cambridge. I'm addicted to its
intuitive ride. It turns on a dime and gives you a nickel back! The
""wow"" factor of passers by is also adoring. The other MAJOR factor is
that you do not have to use the ""juice"" to make it go. You'll get a
full body exercise rocking & rolling it. I like to mix it up, using the
throttle to augment my body & maintain speed to maximize battery life.  Remember: if the battery quits you can still get home.
Cheryl: The movement. Power to go anywhere, nearly
effortless, yet a great workout. Is there any other competition??? Needed more
FUN in my life. Trikke delivered!
Roger: The Tribred Pon-e is handy for 'Major
Events' where you have to find parking space BLOCKS (or even miles) away. Just
unfold it and cruise (with all your stuff) to the site. It's also great for hitting all the 'hot spots' at Tailgate Parties! When I have multiple stops downtown or at the beach, I bring my electric Trikke along. I park ONCE, and use it to get my chores done in HALF the TIME, while not having to fight the traffic or look for additional parking. Just wish I could use the Trikke 'inside' the stores as
well.....Humm, maybe one of those Blue Plackards with the wheelchair.....is the
Ticket! Plus: while an E-Bike
is a ""Pain in the 'tookus'""; the Tribred Pon-e is
""Up-Standing"" FUN!

FAQs
How
fast does it go? For a rider of 175 lbs (80 kgs)
top speed will be about 15 mph (24 kph) on the flats.

How far
can I go on a charge?  On electric-power alone, range is approximately 11
miles/charge on the 6.6 Ah battery that comes with the Freedom. If you upgrade
to the 9Ah battery the range increases to approximately 15 miles. Some choose
to get an extra battery as well to go further. Add your own carving propulsion and you could double that and get a killer workout.

Do I
have to carve turns to make it go? Nope. Carving
turns can make it go farther and
faster and propel you without using the motor, but you can just cruise on all
electric too.
Is
the battery removable? Yep. You just twist the
key all the way to the left and pull it straight up off the guide rail. 
How
long does it take to recharge the battery? A
full recharge takes 4 hours from empty.
How
do I recharge the battery? It comes with a
charger that plugs into the wall outlet and into the battery.
What
is the weight limit? We set the weight limit at
200 lbs (91 kgs). It will carry heavier riders, but we caution against heavy
riders heading straight up steeper hills or doing jumps as this could damage
the motor or the frame. 
What
is the warranty? Our warranty is one year from
receipt of the vehicle for any manufacturing defects.",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Brilrider Story:</h3>
<p><strong>Brilrider balance bikes are India's First, Favorite and highest selling balance bikes! </strong></p>
<p>I launched the Brilrider for my 1.5 year-old son Raghav back in 2011 in Bangalore, India. Since then Brilrider has achieved tremendous success in India and is currently India's most loved balance bike for the youngest of toddlers. Brilrider has an India design patent and is one of the best designed balance bikes in the world. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539170045/dcbqdvzpjk2d6myokmoc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Brilrider is a revolution in the bicycle space, enabling babies / children as young as 18 month-5 years to start riding without trainer wheels or support! The Brilrider works on a very simple concept of working with the natural and instinctive capabilities of your child. The correct time to start babies on the Brilrider, is when they are able to walk steadily without falling often. Initially, your baby will just use the Brilrider to walk with, as its simple pedal-free and handlebar-limiter-free design enables the baby to walk without restriction. As the child gets confident walking and taking charge of his cool Brilrider, you will notice how he/she starts experimenting with his/her feet-up as he learns that the wheels offer him a faster mode of transport!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539170085/xdsdki1ltwvulthhteds.jpg"" src=""""/>With 7 years of experience making the Brilrider the coolest balance bike, we are now launching the Brilrider Flight to the world!</p>
<p>Brilrider will enter the US market in 2019 with an all-new, feather-light model- Brilrider Flight! It comes with an all-new stunning fluid design with ergonomic angular footrests, airplane-grade aluminium frame, handlebar and seat stem and scintillating anodized, sand-blasted metallic finish! It weighs just 1.9 Kgs (4 lbs)- the lightest balance bike in the world, that even an 18 month-old baby can lift it! It comes with ultra-light 12"" EVA puncture-proof tyres and we have even brought down the lowest seat position to just 11"" from the ground. We want the youngest of babies and parents world over to experience the sheer joy of the Brilrider Flight Experience!</p>

Brilrider balance bikes are India's First, Favorite and highest selling balance bikes! 
I launched the Brilrider for my 1.5 year-old son Raghav back in 2011 in Bangalore, India. Since then Brilrider has achieved tremendous success in India and is currently India's most loved balance bike for the youngest of toddlers. Brilrider has an India design patent and is one of the best designed balance bikes in the world. 

The Brilrider is a revolution in the bicycle space, enabling babies / children as young as 18 month-5 years to start riding without trainer wheels or support! The Brilrider works on a very simple concept of working with the natural and instinctive capabilities of your child. The correct time to start babies on the Brilrider, is when they are able to walk steadily without falling often. Initially, your baby will just use the Brilrider to walk with, as its simple pedal-free and handlebar-limiter-free design enables the baby to walk without restriction. As the child gets confident walking and taking charge of his cool Brilrider, you will notice how he/she starts experimenting with his/her feet-up as he learns that the wheels offer him a faster mode of transport!
With 7 years of experience making the Brilrider the coolest balance bike, we are now launching the Brilrider Flight to the world!
Brilrider will enter the US market in 2019 with an all-new, feather-light model- Brilrider Flight! It comes with an all-new stunning fluid design with ergonomic angular footrests, airplane-grade aluminium frame, handlebar and seat stem and scintillating anodized, sand-blasted metallic finish! It weighs just 1.9 Kgs (4 lbs)- the lightest balance bike in the world, that even an 18 month-old baby can lift it! It comes with ultra-light 12"" EVA puncture-proof tyres and we have even brought down the lowest seat position to just 11"" from the ground. We want the youngest of babies and parents world over to experience the sheer joy of the Brilrider Flight Experience!

These are some customer submitted videos (some are also looped on NickJr and other national Televsion Channels)  just so you understand how loved the Brilrider brand is in India (Please note the Brilrider bike models in videos and some photos differ from the new Brilrider being launched):

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cryptosteel is an indestructible stainless steel artefact which stores your confidential information without the use of third parties.

Furthermore, the fact that the wallet operates entirely offline means that, unlike engraved plates with a QR code, no third party can access the owner’s <span style=""background-color: initial;"">personal data.</span><div>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Cryptosteel is the result of a long process of design evolution through which our innovative team endeavoured to marry the enduring typographical legacies of the Renaissance Gutenberg Press with the material robustness of a military dog tag.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Human history has consistently demonstrated that one cannot rely on hard drives or electronic devices to safe-guard their private information and all of the world’s biggest, ostensibly most reliable institutions are prone to dissolution. In this context Cryptosteel is marked out as an ideal confidential information storage-system: even the worst disasters cannot destroy the cold wallet’s stainless steel construction (AISI 304). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The wallet thus stands to benefit bitcoin and non-bitcoin users alike. Cryptosteel functions as an ideal place to store passwords of any kind as well as confidential family information. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Think of the artefact as like a readily-accessible safe deposit box: you decide what goes in and out and you are the only one who can make any changes.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The essence of Cryptosteel is <b>peace of mind</b>, and the security benefits of the wallet have only been enhanced as a result of our recent collaboration with the world-leading bitcoin security specialists, <a href=""http://satoshilabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SatoshiLabs</a>. As Cryptosteel Inventor,  Wojciech Stopinski, observed: </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>“If we want to become our own banks, we need to protect our assets. That's where Trezor and Cryptosteel come in. Together we have created the <b>everlasting bitcoin safe.</b> SatoshiLabs took the original design and functionality of Cryptosteel and upgraded it, making it even better and with increased benefits to user""</i></p>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cryptosteel comes with more than 250 stainless steel letter blocks engraved on each side. Users are able to store up to 96 characters worth of confidential information in the cold wallet in minutes, guaranteeing the data’s safety without the need for specialized tools. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Furthermore, the fact that storing information in Cryptosteel requires no third-party contact (even with us) means the user remains in full control of their own anonymity as well as the security of their data is throughout the process.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In this respect the artefact is ideal for use in the context of ultra-secure setups involving multisig wallets. As Director of SatoshiLabs, Alena Vranova, pointed out:  ""<i>Cryptosteel will come to be used as an <b>“eternal backup”</b> for future generations, adding that the cold wallet “represents an advanced form of the <a href=""https://www.buytrezor.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TREZOR</a> Recovery seed card. it’s anonymous, offline and confidential but moreover, it’s really durable, resistant to fire or water.” </i></p>

</div></div>","Cryptosteel is an indestructible stainless steel artefact which stores your confidential information without the use of third parties. Simply hand-assemble your private sentence from the supplied letter-blocks, enclose the data in the cold wallet and rest-assured of its safety.Cryptosteel is fireproof, corrosion-resistant, acid-resistant and virtually uncrushable. Furthermore, the fact that the wallet operates entirely offline means that, unlike engraved plates with a QR code, no third party can access the owner’s personal data.




Cryptosteel is the result of a long process of design evolution through which our innovative team endeavoured to marry the enduring typographical legacies of the Renaissance Gutenberg Press with the material robustness of a military dog tag.

Human history has consistently demonstrated that one cannot rely on hard drives or electronic devices to safe-guard their private information and all of the world’s biggest, ostensibly most reliable institutions are prone to dissolution. In this context Cryptosteel is marked out as an ideal confidential information storage-system: even the worst disasters cannot destroy the cold wallet’s stainless steel construction (AISI 304). 


The wallet thus stands to benefit bitcoin and non-bitcoin users alike. Cryptosteel functions as an ideal place to store passwords of any kind as well as confidential family information. 
Think of the artefact as like a readily-accessible safe deposit box: you decide what goes in and out and you are the only one who can make any changes.  
The essence of Cryptosteel is peace of mind, and the security benefits of the wallet have only been enhanced as a result of our recent collaboration with the world-leading bitcoin security specialists, SatoshiLabs. As Cryptosteel Inventor,  Wojciech Stopinski, observed: 
“If we want to become our own banks, we need to protect our assets. That's where Trezor and Cryptosteel come in. Together we have created the everlasting bitcoin safe. SatoshiLabs took the original design and functionality of Cryptosteel and upgraded it, making it even better and with increased benefits to user""



Cryptosteel comes with more than 250 stainless steel letter blocks engraved on each side. Users are able to store up to 96 characters worth of confidential information in the cold wallet in minutes, guaranteeing the data’s safety without the need for specialized tools. 
Furthermore, the fact that storing information in Cryptosteel requires no third-party contact (even with us) means the user remains in full control of their own anonymity as well as the security of their data is throughout the process.


The final product, you are pledging for:





Container for up to 96 characters + stainless steel letter tilesvariant one:
Unit ""MNEMONIC"" Master Mnemonic Seed BIP39 Ready. 250+ letter tilesvariant two: 
Unit ""ANY KEY"" Upper and lower case and numbers. 320+ letter tiles

Private, off-line storage for private keys and passwords


Lightweight, stainless steel


Indestructible, acid­resistant, and uncrushable


Fireproof up to 1200 C, or 2100 F


Open-Hardware: blueprints available under CC License


Compatibility: Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies

No tools necessary
Made in Poland

In this respect the artefact is ideal for use in the context of ultra-secure setups involving multisig wallets. As Director of SatoshiLabs, Alena Vranova, pointed out:  ""Cryptosteel will come to be used as an “eternal backup” for future generations, adding that the cold wallet “represents an advanced form of the TREZOR Recovery seed card. it’s anonymous, offline and confidential but moreover, it’s really durable, resistant to fire or water.”

Why are we crowdfunding?
Bitcoin users made this product for the Bitcoin community.

We are collecting funds for special tools for our assembly lines. Final product have to be accomplish with mechanical press with maximum pressure of 120 tones. This will allow us to obtain proper repeatability in a big production series and allow us to produce shallow-bended, deep-press elements with engraving.
We would like to raise money for tools and stamps so we can keep the price down for customers.
The Cryptosteel team innovated the cold wallet as a result of experiencing the same difficulties that you all have in attempting to identify a storage system guaranteed to fully safeguard your information. We believe that we have come up with the solution.  
Cryptosteel is an Open Source project and full blueprints will be made available on an Open Hardware basis. All monies raised through the crowdfunding campaign will be managed with full transparency and invested in specialized tools to expand our assembly line as well as in start-up costs so as to keep retail prices at a minimum.
In addition to pledges Cryptosteel also needs your attention and interest!

<h3>Hi!  I'm Tieta.  I just turned 1 last week and I didn't get a car for my birthday.</h3>
<h3>I come from a family of entrepreneurs.  My great-great-grandfather was a carpenter.  He built the original Rock Spring School and Center Grove Baptist Church in Rock Spring, GA.  He also built the building where my nana and I works. </h3>
<h3>The building was originally my great-grandparents Service Station...I don't know what that is, but I'm told that it's pre-convenient store.  It was called  ""Blevins and Son Phillips 66.""  If you're old, you might remember it.</h3>
<h3>As time passed, it became a convenient store.  And, then, my nana had a video store...Noble Zone.  She talks about VHS.  I don't know what that is either, but she says it's like DVD only better.  Now, my mommie, nana and I are trying to get a resale shop going in the place.  It's not easy, but I do what I can.</h3>
<h3>My daddy is an entrepreneur, too!  He owns ""Rodney's Salvage and Moving.""  Bottom line...he deals with scrap metal and brings the good stuff he gets to our resale shop.  He works way too hard and puts in long hours and sometimes, he's even too tired to play with me!  But, I make him laugh and then he plays. </h3>
<h3>My daddy drives a junk truck on his job.  My mommie says it cost too much gas to use everyday.  He can't afford to replace it.  I don't like to ride in it.  It doesn't have air-conditioning!  He needs a new one, but mommie says that's not the priority, right now.  I don't know what priority is either.  My mommie and nana say such big words.</h3>
<h3>I do know that sometimes, when we get ready to go, we don't go.  The truck doesn't always crank and has a lot of flat tires.  I don't know what would happen if I fell and needed to go to the hospital and the truck wouldn't crank or had a flat.  We borrow my granddaddys car sometimes, but it's not always available when we need it.</h3>
<h3>My nana had a car, but it stopped working.  So, we need $2500.00 to buy nana a car and mommie a car and fix daddy's truck.  Nana says it'll take years before the store can afford to buy a car.  So, I told her I'd see what I could do to get her and mommie a car.  All I can do is ask for you to send nana money.</h3>
<h3>My mommie had to get a ""real"" job.  Now me and nana are running the store.  We have to close, sometimes, when we should be open so we can take mommie to work.  She needs a car so she can get to work without hurting our business.  I don't know how many customers come by and leave and never come back because we were closed when we should be open.</h3>
<h3>So, if you think I'm cute and you don't want to see me sweat in that junk truck my daddy has, contribute to the cause so me and nana can get an air-conditioned car.  I want a Viper but my nana says, ""Not in the budget.""  I saw one the other day.  It was pretty!  It made me say, ""Vrroom!""</h3>

</div></div>","Finally, tired, aching legs belong to the past!



Wearing STOX Energy Socks give your legs so much power, you’ll feel like dancing in the clouds, all day long. 



More energy                                        Prevents tired, aching legs



Stay focused, all day long        No more muscular pains





STOX in the press:





Since 2011 we have been working on a revolutionary product which will help you to obtain all the energy you need: STOX Energy Socks. Together with Dr. B.C.V.M. Disselhoff (vascular surgeon at Bergman Clinics) we successfully developed and sold thousands of STOX Energy Socks already. ''We'' are Caspar Disselhoff and Jeroen Smid, both living in Amsterdam where our little office near the Vondelpark is based as well. Our mission is to replace those old-fashioned cotton socks, the ones you are probably wearing right now ;-), by functional socks, which also look good. The socks have received wide media exposure, because of their proven medical effects, such as preventing muscle soreness after running or skating, swollen and painful legs after flying or tired legs because of a standing profession. 






As our company is growing, we would like to expand the assortment with our newest product: STOX Skiing Socks! With your help, we can make this happen. We would be extremely thankful if you will take part in the STOX community and by doing so destroy the symptoms of tired, aching legs and energy levels which are perceived being too low. We have achieved a lot, but there's still a LOT of stuff that needs to be done. Think about more different types of STOX Energy Socks, marketing, distribution channels, exciting product movies, connecting endorsers, and much, much more.
Let's energize together, and be as PRODUCTIVE AS WE CAN BE!


Initial Goal: 
$ 50.000 --> Production of STOX Skiing Socks



Attack the slopes!
Are you one of those people experiencing painful feet during your skiing holidays? Now is the time to achieve the ultimate relief! With the Shin and Ankle Cushioning, which are implemented in every STOX Sports Skiing, your ankles and shins are treated outrageously comfortable. Next to that, the Skiing socks adept to your feet through the compression they contain: this is called STOX Perfect Fit. Last but not least, because the compression improves your blood flow, your muscles feel strong all day long and because of the Merino Wool you’ll never experience cold feet again!
Research demonstrates that with compression stockings, alpine skiers could maintain a deeper tuck position with less perceived exertion and greater deoxygenation of the vastus lateralis muscle, with no differences in whole-body oxygen consumption or blood lactate concentration.(4)













Your time is precious. Gain the energy to accomplish all that you want!
Almost everyone has to deal with it sometimes: tired legs and aching calves because of prolonged standing or sitting. For many people this is common every (working) day, especially for those with a standing profession, such as hairdressers, DJs, photographers, stylists, nurses and hospitality and retail staff.

With our STOX Work Socks, we hope to make it a bit more comfortable and less tiring for the working people who are obliged to prolonged sitting or standing while exercising their profession, so they will still have enough energy left over to do other things after work!

Other hampering phenomenons are muscle pain and shin-splints after sport activities. These injuries can stand in the way for people to exercise their sports. The STOX Running & Recovery Socks can significantly improve the prevention of these constraints, in order to exercise your favorite sports pain free, in a comfortable way. 










                       Technology
                                                      

   STOX® Energizing Flow                                        
All the STOX® Energy Socks create the effect of graduated compression therapy, which consists of tightly squeezing the legs. The compression optimizes the blood flow in your legs and provides maximum oxygen-capacity to the muscles, which gives you the benefits of feeling more energetic and less muscle pains.

                                Milk fiber
The Milk Fiber moistens skin and it is healthy and bacteriostatic. Milk fiber PH is 6.8, which is the same to human skin, which therefore nourishes and lubricate the skin. 
                  Moisture Wicking Fabrics
The ‘Moisture Wicking Fabrics’ are more breathable than natural fabrics like cotton. When the Moisture Wicking fabrics are wet, they swell only 5%, while this is 45% with cotton and 35% with wool. It is the fastest drying fabric available and dries four times faster than cotton. 

            Merino Wool
Merino Wool distinguishes itself by offering superior breathability, temperature regulation, moisture control, and odor-neutralizing properties. 






Now let's explain the different kinds of STOX Energy Socks!

               

















Stretch goal #1: $ 75.000 --> Production of STOX Golf Socks, new perk




Stretch goal #2: $ 100.000 --> Production of STOX Party Socks, new perk
Stretch goal #3: $ 150.000 --> Color Blast of all the different kinds of STOX Energy Socks!

Simply press the power button to turn the electrical system on. Then choose your level of throttle-on-demand power (1-5). You can then twist the throttle and off you go. Pedaling is always encouraged but not required. As an active mobility solution the Liberty Trike gives you the option to get some physical activity when you want it. This is one of the biggest benefits of the Liberty Trike when compared to a conventional mobility scooter.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Don’t forget, if you get into a tight spot, this electric trike has a speed-limited reverse function. There is a red button on the throttle. When you push it, it will stay depressed down and in this position you’ll be in reverse gear. Twist the throttle and you’ll go backwards; the reverse is “speed-limited”, meaning in reverse the speed is much slower for safety. There is also a parking brake for easily mounting your Liberty Trike and keeping it in place and a large LCD readout with speed controls and battery indicator.</p>

There are a few changes in the frame design and some minor changes to the electrical system that we know backers will appreciate. We plan on sharing those improvements with backers of the campaign as they happen.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The great thing about the Liberty Trike first run is that the frame is being made by Worksman Cycles and any changes to the frame can easily happen in a short amount of time. Also, the final painting happens close to home so getting backers the correct colors (you’ll have 5 colors to choose from), will be easily managed.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider about production and delivery is that Electric Bike Technologies has been making systems and distributing e-bike products since 2008. This is not a direct from China to end user project. This is an experienced electric bike company in the USA taking a lot of pride in producing their first complete electric bike (in this case a trike), and then beating your expectations for delivery, service and after-sale support.</p>

<p>We know we can get it done with your help. We know we can make it last and your support will make a difference!</p>
<p>All of the funds raised during the campaign will be used to increase staff and further leverage existing buying power with suppliers. We have already invested in the research and development and we’ve already produced several Liberty Trikes. There is no question whether we can make the bikes and make them well. The challenge, and where you will be helping us in our efforts by backing our project, is in proving the demand for quality electric adult tricycles backed by a solid warranty and first-class customer service.
      </p>
<p>The people who back this campaign will be proving to the electric bike industry, and to the biggest producers of adult tricycles, where the real demand is and where the focus should be. This is not your grandfather’s mobility scooter, this is a new approach to mobility and it’s one that individuals of every age and riding ability can use to improve their lives.</p>
<p>We know that the average tricycle rider will be older and, as such, they may not be familiar with Indiegogo. That said, the Liberty Trike would make an awesome gift for the parent or grandparent you want to keep moving!

<p>Regarding production delays and risks; you will notice from our timeline that production starts before the Indiegogo campaign is even finished. We know what we have to do and we’ve placed a limit (500 Liberty Trikes) on ourselves for about the first year to be certain we can meet the expectations we’re setting. We’ve worked very hard for our reputation over the years for delivering on promises and we don’t expect to start breaking any promises now. We need your help to get the Liberty Trike rolling now but once that process is underway we’ll be using everything we have to make it happen.</p>
<p>We see shipping as a possible risk of course but not one with a long delay time and again, we’ve given ourselves enough room in the timeline to ensure they won’t affect the delivery dates. The other shipping consideration/risk relates to the shipping of hazardous materials, which most e-bike batteries are. This risk has influenced our decision to limit this first run of Liberty Trikes to delivery addresses only inside the contiguous United States. Shipping hazardous outside of the US is much more complicated than receiving and shipping within the US.</p>
<p>We’ve had our fair share of experiences with shipping lithium batteries over the years and it has taught us very well what to do and what not to do. The Liberty Trike LiFePO4 battery pack is UN 38.3 Certified and will be shipped in full compliance with all associated regulations and requirements.</p>

<p><b>How much does it cost? </b></p>
<p>The MSRP of the Liberty Trike will be $1998 USD. The earliest supporters here on Indiegogo are being offered discounts up to 50% (SAVE $999 and pay $999). </p>
<p><b>Shipping: $98 is the shipping fee per trike</b>. Limited to the contiguous USA and will be automatically added to your contribution total when contributing.</p>
<p><b>How Fast? </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Electric-assisted speed is up to 11.5MPH  with 5 levels of top speed controlled by + and - buttons on the LCD </span>and will not have any resistance to natural pedal power above that top assisted speed.</p>
<p><b>How Far?</b> The range for the Liberty Trike is 18-30 miles with the supplied 36v10ah LiFePO4 battery pack. The final range per full charge will ultimately depend on the total load (weight of rider and cargo), input and terrain.</p>
<p><b>Recharge Time? </b>The charge time for the supplied battery pack with 2.5amp charger is about 3.5hrs from empty to full. Like a cell phone, the battery may be charged at any time and the charge time will depend on the present level of charge in the battery.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Color Options? </b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Liberty Trike will be offered in 5 colors (black, classic red, navy blue, orange and safety yellow). You will be asked to choose your color when the campaign ends.</span></p>
<p><b>How is it different from a mobility scooter? </b></p>
<p>The biggest difference is the ability to be active. The Liberty Trike has pedals and pedaling is always encouraged; being more active and getting physical activity is a very good thing. </p>
<p>The other difference is in the cost, the battery, and in the fact that the Liberty Trike is ultra portable. You can take this trike anywhere with far less inconvenience than a conventional mobility scooter.</p>
<p><b>Why the special hinge on the frame?</b> The patent pending hinge allows the Liberty Trike to fold in half or to completely separate into two nearly equally weighted pieces. This feature along with a quick release handle bar and seat post make the Liberty Trike ultra portable and give a level of convenience not found with any other adult tricycle on the planet.</p>
<p><b>Why not just buy a conventional adult trike?</b> Regular adult trikes are great but they don't come close for those that may want, or need, a bit of electric assistance. And the Liberty Trike is unmatched for an industrial strength adult tricycle with regard to convenience, portability and power.</p>
<p><b>Will it fit through the door of my house?</b> The Liberty Trike rear is 25"" wide and was designed to be narrower than any conventional adult tricycle just for this purpose. Doorways are easily navigated, making the Liberty Trike ideal for indoor use. The 2.5"" wide tires provide added stability in consideration of the narrow rear.</p>
<p><b>Can I ride it into the store?</b> This is a great question and the answer remains to be seen. The trike was designed to be agile indoors with the narrow 25"" rear and can also do a full 360 degree turn forward or in reverse so if you're in a supermarket isle and need to turn around you can do it. Whether or not they let you ride the isles... we look forward to you letting us know!</p>
<p><b>Who can service the Liberty Trike?</b> We can, and so can any local bike shop. The tricycle has parts familiar to bike mechanics and the electrical system was designed to be modular so any repairs or replacements will be easy and hassle free. In any case where the bike (or half the bike) may need to come back to our facility for repairs, the shipping hassle will be greatly reduced because of the compact size, modular component design and the patent pending hinge that allows for literally shipping just one half of the trike if necessary.</p>
<p><b>What kind of service will it need?</b> The components and motor on the trike are very durable. There is no ongoing service requirement outside of normal tricycle maintenance. The battery that powers the trike would be the one thing that requires an extra level of care. The battery must be charged regularly when in use, and does require regular maintenance charging during longer periods of storage. Proper maintenance in storage would be to charge the battery pack to full and then come back at least once every 45 days to ""top off"" the battery by charging to full and removing the charger. The charger should not be left on indefinitely but an overnight charge for cell balancing is a good idea every couple weeks.</p>
<p><b>Is it hard to learn to ride it?</b> It's not hard to ride but we would suggest taking some time initially to get comfortable with riding and the feel of the trike. Tricycles are not bicycles and as such it takes some getting used to riding on three wheels. The biggest difference is trusting the trike during braking. You shouldn't put your feet down and should instead use the front disc-brake and rear coaster brakes to stop. Otherwise you'll put your feet down to stop and likely run over your calves with the rear wheels. That tends to happen to almost everyone at least once while getting used to riding any trike.</p>
<p><b>Do I need a driver's license?</b> No, the Liberty Trike system is well under the Federal regulations for a motorized vehicle and is as street legal as any conventional tricycle in most if not all states. Please check with your local DMV or regulatory authority if you are unsure.</p>
<p><b>Can it go up steep hills?</b> Yes, the Liberty Trike is designed with enough power to pull a 300lb load up an 18% grade incline with ease. For comparison the standard wheelchair grade incline is 12.5%.</p>
<p><b>What if it rains?</b> Rain is not an issue. All of the components, motor, battery and connectors are water-resistant to handle rain and wet conditions. With that said, we would not advise storing the Liberty Trike outside or leaving it out in the elements indefinitely as moisture over time will find its way into electronics.</p>
<p><b>How often do I need to replace the battery?</b> The battery pack is a 36v10ah lithium battery with a 1 year warranty and expected 500-700 lifecycles. Lifecycles are the number of times you can expect to discharge and recharge a rechargeable battery from full to empty. Regular use, proper care and charging will contribute to the final number of charges.</p>
<p><b>Can I pedal it to recharge the battery?</b> No, the Liberty Trike does not have regenerative braking or any sort of charging while in use. The concept of regenerative braking or pedaling makes more sense for heavier automobiles but not so much with a 70lb tricycle.</p>
<p><b>Do I need a special lift to take it someplace in a car?</b> One of the best features of the Liberty Trike is its compact design including the folding and separating hinge, quick release seat and quick release handlebars. These unique attributes make the Liberty Trike ultra portable and allow for many convenient options of transport. A special lift, like those required for conventional mobility scooters, is not something anyone should need to transport the Liberty Trike.</p>
<p><b>Is the Liberty Trike covered by Medicaid?</b> The Liberty Trike is not a medical device and therefore is not covered by Medicaid.</p>

    life. 
Liberty Trike is the ultimate mobility solution empowering you to leave your car at home, get around effortlessly when needed, and be more active outdoors!
This a one-of-a-kind electric tricycle designed for everyone on the go. With an industrial frame made in the USA and patent-pending hinge allowing the trike to fold or separate, it’s easy to take anywhere.
RECENT PRESS - Press kit is available here.





How to Order YOUR Liberty Trike NOW!




Pulls up to 300lbs up most inclines with ease.

The lithium battery pack has a range of up to 24 miles. Charges in 3 hrs.
Electric-assisted speed is up to 11.5MPH  with 5 levels of top speed.
Sturmey Archer S2C 2-Speed Coaster Brake Kick Shift Hub

Wide 16” x 2.5” provide stability and comfort.
The narrow 25” rear allows you to navigate doorways with ease.
A 360 degree turning radius allows maneuver in tight spots.
It can fold or separate with the patent pending hinge making it ultraportable.

Take It Indoors!








Tackle the Steepest Hills!
Operating the Liberty Trike is easy. Simply press the power button to turn the electrical system on. Then choose your level of throttle-on-demand power (1-5). You can then twist the throttle and off you go. Pedaling is always encouraged but not required. As an active mobility solution the Liberty Trike gives you the option to get some physical activity when you want it. This is one of the biggest benefits of the Liberty Trike when compared to a conventional mobility scooter.

Don’t forget, if you get into a tight spot, this electric trike has a speed-limited reverse function. There is a red button on the throttle. When you push it, it will stay depressed down and in this position you’ll be in reverse gear. Twist the throttle and you’ll go backwards; the reverse is “speed-limited”, meaning in reverse the speed is much slower for safety. There is also a parking brake for easily mounting your Liberty Trike and keeping it in place and a large LCD readout with speed controls and battery indicator.








Average Consumption: 200watts-300watts @ 11mph / 19wh-28wh per mile


Max Torque: 60N-m


Torque at cruising speed – max efficiency: 2.8N-m - 4.28N-m





The Liberty Trike is for everyone who wants to ride more often, ride stable and ride with assistance and stability. It can be used in hundreds of scenarios to improve your lifestyle, like at the beach, in big cities, in parks, around the house and anywhere else!
Great for Getting Around Town


or for Chillin Like a Villian!





The Liberty Trike is about 95% finished and we say that because we still have some design features we will be adding to make it even better before final production starts. There are a few changes in the frame design and some minor changes to the electrical system that we know backers will appreciate. We plan on sharing those improvements with backers of the campaign as they happen.

The great thing about the Liberty Trike first run is that the frame is being made by Worksman Cycles and any changes to the frame can easily happen in a short amount of time. Also, the final painting happens close to home so getting backers the correct colors (you’ll have 5 colors to choose from), will be easily managed.
The other thing to consider about production and delivery is that Electric Bike Technologies has been making systems and distributing e-bike products since 2008. This is not a direct from China to end user project. This is an experienced electric bike company in the USA taking a lot of pride in producing their first complete electric bike (in this case a trike), and then beating your expectations for delivery, service and after-sale support.










Please consider backing our campaign and improving someone else’s life and your own; The Liberty Trike is the Ultimate GIFT!
Let’s show the world that there are better, smarter, more active options for moving. We appreciate any and all contributions and ask everyone to help us raise awareness. Please share our project by simply telling your friends, sharing on social media and using the Indiegogo share tools.
Thank you for your continued support and for believing in us!
We are introducing the Liberty Trike on Indiegogo to prove that the market for electric tricycles is enormous, and we’re giving you early adopters the exclusive opportunity to reserve one of the very first Liberty Trikes to be produced in the USA at steep discounts.
We know we can get it done with your help. We know we can make it last and your support will make a difference!
All of the funds raised during the campaign will be used to increase staff and further leverage existing buying power with suppliers. We have already invested in the research and development and we’ve already produced several Liberty Trikes. There is no question whether we can make the bikes and make them well. The challenge, and where you will be helping us in our efforts by backing our project, is in proving the demand for quality electric adult tricycles backed by a solid warranty and first-class customer service.
      
The people who back this campaign will be proving to the electric bike industry, and to the biggest producers of adult tricycles, where the real demand is and where the focus should be. This is not your grandfather’s mobility scooter, this is a new approach to mobility and it’s one that individuals of every age and riding ability can use to improve their lives.
We know that the average tricycle rider will be older and, as such, they may not be familiar with Indiegogo. That said, the Liberty Trike would make an awesome gift for the parent or grandparent you want to keep moving!
      




Electric Bike Technologies has been providing the highest level of customer service and after-sale support since the company started. Today we have expert staff in place supporting our existing conversion system customers. This same staff will be supporting Liberty Trike owners. The Liberty Trike website already has LiveChat support now. Email support is a given and our response time will surprise you.

His graduate degree is a Master of Science in Industrial Design at Philadelphia University, and a CC in CRO-MO Bicycle Frame Building from the United Bicycle Institute.
Alec’s energy, education and extensive knowledge of cycling has been leveraged in the design and function of the Liberty Trike and he is committed to seeing plans through to final delivery of the first production run and beyond.





There are always unforeseen obstacles when bringing a new product to market; usually the longer delays come with actual production and then it would be shipping holds as the next likely cause for delays.
Regarding production delays and risks; you will notice from our timeline that production starts before the Indiegogo campaign is even finished. We know what we have to do and we’ve placed a limit (500 Liberty Trikes) on ourselves for about the first year to be certain we can meet the expectations we’re setting. We’ve worked very hard for our reputation over the years for delivering on promises and we don’t expect to start breaking any promises now. We need your help to get the Liberty Trike rolling now but once that process is underway we’ll be using everything we have to make it happen.
We see shipping as a possible risk of course but not one with a long delay time and again, we’ve given ourselves enough room in the timeline to ensure they won’t affect the delivery dates. The other shipping consideration/risk relates to the shipping of hazardous materials, which most e-bike batteries are. This risk has influenced our decision to limit this first run of Liberty Trikes to delivery addresses only inside the contiguous United States. Shipping hazardous outside of the US is much more complicated than receiving and shipping within the US.
We’ve had our fair share of experiences with shipping lithium batteries over the years and it has taught us very well what to do and what not to do. The Liberty Trike LiFePO4 battery pack is UN 38.3 Certified and will be shipped in full compliance with all associated regulations and requirements.





Who is the Liberty Trike made for? The Liberty Trike is designed for anyone that wants to get around actively or effortlessly on 3 wheels. The compact design makes it portable for taking on trips and easy to navigate in confined spaces. The electrical system and powerful hub motor enable the Liberty Trike to travel over most terrains and up reasonable inclines with ease.
How much does it cost? 
The MSRP of the Liberty Trike will be $1998 USD. The earliest supporters here on Indiegogo are being offered discounts up to 50% (SAVE $999 and pay $999). 
Shipping: $98 is the shipping fee per trike. Limited to the contiguous USA and will be automatically added to your contribution total when contributing.
How Fast? Electric-assisted speed is up to 11.5MPH  with 5 levels of top speed controlled by + and - buttons on the LCD and will not have any resistance to natural pedal power above that top assisted speed.
How Far? The range for the Liberty Trike is 18-30 miles with the supplied 36v10ah LiFePO4 battery pack. The final range per full charge will ultimately depend on the total load (weight of rider and cargo), input and terrain.
Recharge Time? The charge time for the supplied battery pack with 2.5amp charger is about 3.5hrs from empty to full. Like a cell phone, the battery may be charged at any time and the charge time will depend on the present level of charge in the battery.

Color Options? 
The Liberty Trike will be offered in 5 colors (black, classic red, navy blue, orange and safety yellow). You will be asked to choose your color when the campaign ends.
How is it different from a mobility scooter? 
The biggest difference is the ability to be active. The Liberty Trike has pedals and pedaling is always encouraged; being more active and getting physical activity is a very good thing. 
The other difference is in the cost, the battery, and in the fact that the Liberty Trike is ultra portable. You can take this trike anywhere with far less inconvenience than a conventional mobility scooter.
Why the special hinge on the frame? The patent pending hinge allows the Liberty Trike to fold in half or to completely separate into two nearly equally weighted pieces. This feature along with a quick release handle bar and seat post make the Liberty Trike ultra portable and give a level of convenience not found with any other adult tricycle on the planet.
Why not just buy a conventional adult trike? Regular adult trikes are great but they don't come close for those that may want, or need, a bit of electric assistance. And the Liberty Trike is unmatched for an industrial strength adult tricycle with regard to convenience, portability and power.
Will it fit through the door of my house? The Liberty Trike rear is 25"" wide and was designed to be narrower than any conventional adult tricycle just for this purpose. Doorways are easily navigated, making the Liberty Trike ideal for indoor use. The 2.5"" wide tires provide added stability in consideration of the narrow rear.
Can I ride it into the store? This is a great question and the answer remains to be seen. The trike was designed to be agile indoors with the narrow 25"" rear and can also do a full 360 degree turn forward or in reverse so if you're in a supermarket isle and need to turn around you can do it. Whether or not they let you ride the isles... we look forward to you letting us know!

The charger should not be left on indefinitely but an overnight charge for cell balancing is a good idea every couple weeks.
Is it hard to learn to ride it? It's not hard to ride but we would suggest taking some time initially to get comfortable with riding and the feel of the trike. Tricycles are not bicycles and as such it takes some getting used to riding on three wheels. The biggest difference is trusting the trike during braking. You shouldn't put your feet down and should instead use the front disc-brake and rear coaster brakes to stop. Otherwise you'll put your feet down to stop and likely run over your calves with the rear wheels. That tends to happen to almost everyone at least once while getting used to riding any trike.
Do I need a driver's license? No, the Liberty Trike system is well under the Federal regulations for a motorized vehicle and is as street legal as any conventional tricycle in most if not all states. Please check with your local DMV or regulatory authority if you are unsure.
Can it go up steep hills? Yes, the Liberty Trike is designed with enough power to pull a 300lb load up an 18% grade incline with ease. For comparison the standard wheelchair grade incline is 12.5%.
What if it rains? Rain is not an issue. All of the components, motor, battery and connectors are water-resistant to handle rain and wet conditions. With that said, we would not advise storing the Liberty Trike outside or leaving it out in the elements indefinitely as moisture over time will find its way into electronics.
How often do I need to replace the battery? The battery pack is a 36v10ah lithium battery with a 1 year warranty and expected 500-700 lifecycles. Lifecycles are the number of times you can expect to discharge and recharge a rechargeable battery from full to empty.

<p><strong>SKUNKLOCK</strong> is <strong>SAFE</strong>; designed to never expose the chemicals inside. The smelly chemicals are confined and permanently sealed within a secure hollow chamber throughout the lock.  The only way you may expose the chemicals is by trying to cut through it with an angle grinder (even then it wouldn’t be easy).</p>
<p><strong>SKUNKLOCK</strong> is <strong>STRONG </strong>- stronger than the highest quality U-Locks on the market.  The lock is made from hardened medium-carbon steel that exceeds 450 brinell.  The difference is that if a thief cuts far enough through to puncture the seal, the lock will release smelly chemicals stopping the thief in their tracks.</p>
<p><strong>SKUNKLOCK</strong> is <strong>LEGAL - </strong>We have taken the necessary precautions to ensure that the SkunkLock is legal and compliant with US laws and regulations.  On March 2016, we conducted a survey of state laws within the United States regarding the sale and ownership of SkunkLock products.  We have identified that there are some possible limitations of shipping the SkunkLock to certain states within the US due to the fact that some versions of the SkunkLock may contain capsaicin compounds. We know that these regulations were enacted with pepper spray in mind. Although the SkunkLock is not strictly a pepper spray product, in order to ensure compliance, we may initially reserve our right to refuse directly selling and shipping our SkunkLock product to certain states or countries. However, we also reserve the right to ship SkunkLock products that contain our alternative formula that does not utilize capsaicin as a primary irritant; thus, ensuring our compliance in those states. Please visit our website for further information and our latest stance on legal compliance and check with your local and State laws as these may differ from state to state and country by country.</p>

<p><strong>Is the SkunkLock guaranteed to prevent theft?</strong></p>
<p>No lock can guarantee someone will not go the extra mile to steal your bike or motorcycle, especially if it’s expensive and worth the risk (and discomfort in our case).  However, the SkunkLock does provide you the best chance of deterring theft by being the least attractive lock to compromise on your block.  Thieves will generally take a slightly less profitable bike if the risk is significantly less.  If a thief compromises the SkunkLock, not only are they exposing themselves to chemicals, someone nearby may be asking what that smell is.</p>
<p>Note: the SkunkLock won't work if you don't lock your bike properly, or fail to lock your bike completely.  For example, if you only use one SkunkLock on your back wheel and frame (the two most expensive parts of your bike), then your front wheel may still be stolen.</p>
<p><strong>Can't a thief just wear a mask or protection?</strong></p>
<p>Technically, yes.  Will it help them steal your bike? Probably not.  The formula that we've developed is detectable through even some of the most robust gas masks (unfortunately, we learned this the hard way!).  More importantly, we aren't strictly relying on chemicals incapacitating the thief to prevent the theft.  There is no technology that can guarantee theft prevention; however, we do believe SKUNKLOCK is the best lock on the market to deter theft.  Not only does an attack on the SKUNKLOCK release chemicals onto the thief that create a scene that makes people take notice, it also has economic implications for the thief.  Our formula irreversibly ruins the clothes worn by the thief or any of the protection they may be wearing, and replacing these items is likely more expensive than the resale value of your stolen bike (generally only 1/10 of the retail price).  You don't need to be perfect, you just have to be the best protected on your block.  So more than likely, a thief will attack a more hassle free bike parked nearby than your bike.</p>
<p><strong>How durable is the SkunkLock?</strong></p>
<p>The SkunkLock is made from the strongest materials we could find.  We’ve developed a comprehensive testing process to test for extreme wear and tear and are confident that it can be used for many years without any problems.</p>
<p><strong>What if I lose my key?</strong></p>
<p>Each SkunkLock comes with an industry standard unique code which you may use to request additional keys.  Keys will have the option for overnight mail in order to ensure you receive replacements as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Is SkunkLock a ""Smart Lock""?</strong></p>
<p>No, and for good reason! Smart Locks (think those with fingerprint readers, GPS trackers, alarms, or are app enabled) are actually pretty dumb when it comes to preventing your bike from being stolen. We've tried and tested many new Smart enabled locks that have become available on the market.  Each lock was just as easy to cut through with an angle grinder (if not easier) or was easily disabled.  But worse, the technology in each lock created more vulnerabilities than security.  For these reasons, SkunkLock is a purely mechanical and chemical solution to deterring theft. <a href=""http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/bluetooth-smart-locks-easily-hackable/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">READ THIS SUMMARY for more information.</a></p>

<p>We’ve been building electric bikes for nearly 3 years now. Our initial goal was simple – getting from point A to B on a bicycle in an effortless and fun fashion. We put together our first prototypes with the intention of making a practical yet beautiful electric bike. After building different prototypes, we managed to come up with a frame design that allowed us to fit the battery and electronics inside the frame, making the final result look exactly like a regular good-looking bicycle would. By using premium parts and clever design, we’ve managed to keep the bicycle light.</p>
<p>With your support on Indiegogo, we will bring these bikes into production. By backing Ampler, you will be part of creating a shift in the world of electric bikes, where all bikes are practical, great-looking and built with quality in mind.<br/> </p>
<h3>PhD in Electric Assist</h3>What makes Ampler’s electric bikes special is the way that they assist you. Simply put, the smart microchips constantly measure the torque you apply when you pedal. This information is passed on to the motor which applies the same amount of electric assist.<p> </p>

<p>In short, the two bikes have very different personalities. Hawk is sporty while Bilberry is elegant. Hawk features a single-speed drivetrain while Bilberry has a 9-speed drivetrain. Hawk is also a little lighter at 14 kg (31 lbs) compared to Bilberry’s 17 kg (37 lbs). However, Bilberry has other comfort-oriented perks, such as the upright riding position, a wider seat and full fenders to combat rain.</p>

How Ampler came to be
We’ve been building electric bikes for nearly 3 years now. Our initial goal was simple – getting from point A to B on a bicycle in an effortless and fun fashion. We put together our first prototypes with the intention of making a practical yet beautiful electric bike. After building different prototypes, we managed to come up with a frame design that allowed us to fit the battery and electronics inside the frame, making the final result look exactly like a regular good-looking bicycle would.

PhD in Electric AssistWhat makes Ampler’s electric bikes special is the way that they assist you. Simply put, the smart microchips constantly measure the torque you apply when you pedal. This information is passed on to the motor which applies the same amount of electric assist. 
When you first receive the bike, the default maximum power output will be 250W, which gives you extra oomph till the speed of 25 km/h (15,5 mph). The power output and speed are user-configurable with the Ampler smartphone app, developed specifically for Ampler Bikes by coModule.  
So why do I need the app again?
  
 
Actually, you don’t need it to ride Ampler bikes. The app simply lets you customize your riding experience. In the smartphone app, you can adjust:

Motor power – increase or decrease your acceleration
Max assist speed – the speed at which the assist stops helping you

Assist level – how much the motor assists you in proportion to your input

On top of configuring all this, our app lets you see how much range in kilometers you have left in your battery. It also helps navigate with the built in maps capability, share your rides on social networks, receive updates to your bike’s electronics (that’s right, Ampler is that smart) and directly contact Ampler Bikes. We respond within 24 hours on all weekdays. 

The app is available for both Android and iOS.

The charger is compatible both with EU and US electrical voltage and plug.

The modern build technology keeps the aluminium frame light yet sturdy and comfortable. It’s also rust-proof, which means that salt and water leave no marks on your bike.

And here’s what's in it for you guys:
You'll be the first to get an Ampler bike

You’ll get the bike cheaper than the regular price
We guarantee you’ll get an unforgettable augmented cycling experience that will bring a smile to your face

 
Frequently Asked Questions
In short, the two bikes have very different personalities. Hawk is sporty while Bilberry is elegant. Hawk features a single-speed drivetrain while Bilberry has a 9-speed drivetrain. Hawk is also a little lighter at 14 kg (31 lbs) compared to Bilberry’s 17 kg (37 lbs). However, Bilberry has other comfort-oriented perks, such as the upright riding position, a wider seat and full fenders to combat rain.


Where’s the battery?All electronics and the battery are hidden within the frames. This keeps the looks minimalist while also hiding both from the elements and other external factors. 
What’s the difference between Hawk and Bilberry?

How much do the bikes weigh?Hawk weighs 14 kg (31 lbs) and Bilberry weighs 17 kg (37 lbs) 
How often do I have to charge the battery? The average range of the electric assist is 70 km (43 mi), and if you run out of juice, you simply pedal on like you would on a regular bike. Charging the battery from drained to full takes only 3 hours. You can connect your charger to any regular power outlet.
What happens when the battery dies?After running out of battery power or turning off the assist, you can still ride with Ampler as you would do with a regular bicycle.
Can I charge the battery by pedalling?No, the batteries in Ampler bikes can only be charged with the charger that’s provided with the bike upon purchase. However, if you run out of battery power, you can pedal on like you would on a regular bicycle.
Can the battery be removed?Yes. The frame and the battery are designed in such a way that every professional bike shop could remove the battery, and if needed, replace it with a new one in under one hour.
How do I take care of the bikes?Maintenance is carried out as on a regular bicycle and every professional bike shop will be able to maintain our bikes.
How are the bikes delivered?Bikes are safely packed in a box and require minimal assembling.

 

How much does the shipping cost? Nothing.  All Ampler bikes are delivered to your door free of charge. Additionally, all shippings fees and taxes in EU, US and Canada have already been taken care of.

How to assemble the bike when delivered to my door?Assembling the bike is super simple. We include the instructions with the bike. You can do it yourself or, if you prefer, take it to a local bike shop.
Do you offer warranty?  Yes. All Ampler bikes are covered for 2 years. However, the normal wear of tires, brake pads, chainrings, chain, and bearings is an inevitable part of cycling thus not covered.
Do you sell bike accessories? Not yet, but we are soon planning to add fenders, rear racks, lights, baskets and bells to our accessories. Stay tuned for more information. 
Where can I buy repair parts and components? The battery is custom-made for us, so you will be able to buy it only from us. We will send you a replacement battery and instructions for the procedure needed. Other, more common bike components can be bought either from us or from any professional bike shop.
Are the bikes street legal?Yes. Our bikes are capable of a top speed of 35km/h (21,7 mph) but by default are limited according to EN15194 to the top speed of 25 km/h (15,5 mph). This means that the motor will only help you up to 25km/h. You can change these settings from the smartphone app.
What happens if you don’t reach your goal?We have an already established supply chain which will make sure that you will get your bike even if we don’t reach our goal on Indiegogo.
Can I test ride the bikes?You can test ride the bikes in the following locations and dates:

Helsinki, Finland: 24.04 at Länsiväyläjuoksu, Espoo

He started out on a 85cc and then moved to an 85cc super mini. A super mini is an advanced version of the bike. He raced for a couple years and then under very unfortunate circumstances he had to sell his bike and stop racing. Then due to family support he was able to buy a used Yamaha 250cc, four stroke. The top end needs to be fixed and the suspension needs work. We are doing this fundraiser to get Matt's bike fixed and to get him racing the last part of the season and ready for next year. We just bought a new neck brace, chest protector and helmet for him.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>Matt races in district 23. In 2009 he got 5th in his district in the 85cc class 12-15, out of 108 people. He also got 8th in the district for the 85cc class 9-12, out of 104 people. Also that year he got 17th in his district in the Super mini class, out of 90 people. He raced over 40 races to receive those spots. Each race you gain so many points and those points at the end of the year are your spots over all in the district. Matt didn't get to race much after 2010 and once he got his 250 last year he practiced when he could and tried to get stuff going again. One difficulty after another has kept Matt from racing so far this year. Matt only got to race one day, mother's day in two heats before his bike needed the forks replaced. :(</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>On mother's day Matt got third in his first Moto and second in his second Moto, so second overall. It was his FIRST TIME racing in over two years and FIRST TIME racing on his 250. There were 16 people in each race. He did very good for that day! He received a trophy and has many trophies from the previous years. He has placed first, second, and third in many races, in the couple of seasons he raced. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>The goal of 500 is for parts and labor to get the bike up to par for racing conditions and up keep after. If we reach the goal we can always go over. Fixing a bike for racing is different from just leisure riding. The bike needs to have special attention to detail when fixing the bike and also more sturdier parts, because of the hard use of the bike. The wear and tear of races every weekend takes its toll on the bike and up keep is very important after the bike is fixed. Each race costs money to enter and if we reach our goal, the extra money will go towards racing and up keep. If we don't reach our goal, the funds that are donated will be used to get started on fixing the bike. Any amount helps and we are very grateful for all contributions and help to make dreams come true.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>The perks of donating come in the form of t-shirts, stickers, posters, and company logos on his bike for the big sponsors. We have three different options for t-shirts. One option is $25 for a white 90% cotton 10% polyester blend shirt that on the front has a printed image of Matt going over a jump with his name and number. The second option is $35 for a white with blue side stripes 100% polyester shirt with moisture wicking technology to keep you cooler. The image of Matt will be on the back with his name and number on the front. The image and text will be heat transferred onto the shirt which creates a bond with the fabric and lasts longer.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>The third option is $40 for a gray 90% cotton 10% polyester blend shirt with an image of Matt going over a jump and the words Never Look Back on the back and his name and number on the front. This shirt will only be available at a limited quantity. It is a bigger image and harder to produce. If you have any questions on how to order the t-shirts or want more info about the fundraiser email 441mhendrix@gmail.com</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>** Pictures of shirts in gallery **</span></p>

<p class=""p1""><span>*Special Thanks to Minneapolis Custom for sponsoring Matt and providing us with these great t-shirts*</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>For the bigger sponsors we can offer to put your logo on his bike and on all our up and coming flyers and advertising. We will promote your business through promotion of Matt and let everyone know who is sponsoring his racing. Your company will get publicity through his promotion. Any chance we get we will promote your business as one of Matt's sponsors. Matt in the past has gave his trophies, and other items to companies that have sponsored him. They can display the items in their stores and show their customers how they sponsor a local racer. He can promote your business on other items as well. If you sponsor him and have clothing or other items he can use while racing or in off season he will make sure to use them. Any questions or more information email 441mhendrix@gmail.com </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span>Matt has loved riding and racing dirt bike since he started. He has always been the Evil Kenevil type, riding skate board, bmx bikes and doing stunts on everything he can get his hands on. He has always been good at sports and gets good grades in school. He is a hard worker and is smart about his racing style. He wants to go places in racing dirt bike and needs the support to get there. Watching Matt race dirt bike is such a thrill and adventure. As soon as he can get racing again everyone is invited to come to them. He has received many trophies, plaques, and achievements in the couple years he has raced and wants to keep his good record going. </span></p>

You can let all your friends and family know about the fundraiser and connect them with the link. You can share this site through Facebook and other social media. If you have any other fundraiser ideas please let us know. If you know of any companies that sponsor up and coming young adults in sports let us know. Matt will need to get the parts for his bike, so if anyone knows any parts places that will offer a discount for sponsorship, please let us know.

In Nexity we want to take to the market a simple and fast on-line process to stand out from the masses on top of a high-end eScooter, whose performances aren't second to no one. So not only you'll ride a custom or even a one-off eScooter, but also you'll have under your feet a formidable premium electric device.The Nexity Sonic eScooters go fast (up to 32 Km/h - 20 Mph), they run long (up to 45 Km - 28 Mi autonomy), ride safe (triple braking system, oversized 10'' wheels), work smart (removable Cruise Control & Panasonic battery with Intelligent BMS), look cool (curvilinear aerospace aluminum frame) and, last but not least theySTAND OUT FROM THE CROWD!These are our standard black Nexity X7 Sonic and X8 Sonic: Close your eyes and imagine any custom design applied on your Nexity eScooter! Now open your eyes: YES, YOU CAN DO IT, with 15 cool designs right now! Not only we have taken to the market one of the best premium electric scooter for 2021 season, but we have also created a full line of exciting wrap-stickers to make your Scooter a real one-off!

We have lost the counting of how many times we have cut millimeter by millimeter the prototypes, tested different materials and thicknesses, wrapped and unwrapped hundreds of times, and finally we have reached the perfect balance of brilliance, simplicity in the application process (including detach-attach multiple times to eliminate wrong applications), resistance to scratches, water and long sun/cold exposures. This is why we have chosen the highest quality wrapping film, therefore the 3M Scotchcal Graphic Film IJ35C, the same used to wrap Rally & Dakar cars & trucks!
You can apply our 3M hi-grade wrapping stickers at room temperature, reposition any component as many times you need and then activate it with the final pressure, when you have found the perfect placing. Because Nexity Sonic models share the frame (and just this!) with other brands, you can also perk just the sticker and customize your eScooter from Amazon, Blaupunkt, Cecotec, Carrefour, Grundig, Levy, Renault, Turboant and Vivobike (check carefully the correspondence of your model frame with our X7 Sonic and X8 Sonic versions).Discover in deep the key-winning factors which position Nexity eScooters on a clear superior quality level:NEXITY X7 SONICNEXITY X8 SONICIf you aren't yet fully convinced of Nexity's technical supremacy, then have a look at these  comparison tables: we analysed the main competitors and simply have put the results on the same line. We let you judge....Proudly we have the same retail price of the global brands (if not less), but we give you much more value, including the best of the best battery in the world, the genuine Japanese PANASONIC!For Nexity Sonic eScooters we have selected the best factory among many, because we did not want any compromise on quality, whatever it would have meant in terms of costs.

</div></div>","Overview
Riding e-bike is only a means of transportation? Not only that, it can be fun, and it can be your lifestyle. FIIDO commits itself to providing customers all over the world with a practical, free, and personalized environmentally friendly commute method. Now it comes to our D11 electric folding bike. 
Stylish & Powerful
It's electric, but comes with concealed battery and motor.

Media Coverage


D11 reconstructs the shape of the traditional e-bike, using aerospace lightweight aluminum alloy to make the body weigh 12.9kg. It provides 100km riding range in moped mode, while still being ultra-light weight. This allows riders a next-level riding experience with an unprecedented body frame. 


The FIIDO D11’s modular design has a 36V 11.6Ah removable battery to allow for great distances to be traveled.


We thought of everything. The integrated seatpost contains both the battery and taillight to minimize parts and maximize efficiencies.  


The folded D11 can easily fit into the trunk and can be rolled, which makes it convenient to transfer by offering more use scenarios.



Hidden in the 20-inch rear wheel is the 250W brushless gear motor, which boasts compact size and light weight to provide greater power for overcoming steeper roads with lower energy consumption. The aesthetics of the electric bicycle are unique. The perfect balance between form and function.


Shimano 7-speed gear with 3 adjustable levels in moped mode endows FIIDO D11 with sports attributes, assisting every rider in finding their personalized riding style.


Equipped with Shimano 7-speed gear and chain, you can cycle with different speeds. Take in the scenery and enjoy the ride with effortless performance.


FIIDO D11’s ergonomic electric bike design conforms to your body. Your riding posture will improve, so prepare for a comfortable ride. 








The FIIDO team has been working hard to study electric folding bicycles over the years and is committed to providing better products and more riding fun for people who promote eco-friendly commute. 


Founded in December 2016, FIIDO is committed to assisting every optimist who strives forward. Every FIIDO e-bike is designed with an extremely lightened frame and a stealth  bicycle exterior.
The first FIIDO e-bike was born in 2017, and gained widespread attention. We desire to provide cyclists the ability to commute more efficiently, while giving riders exercise with a more enjoyable riding experience.

We have, and we're guessing it will eventually happen to you if it hasn't already. When such a situation arises, chances are that a dead or weak battery is the culprit.</p><h2>Why does a car battery die or weaken?</h2><p>There are a number of reasons why batteries can weaken and fail. A few common ones include:</p><ul>
<li>Leaving headlights, interior lights, flashers, and the CD / radio on when the car isn't running.</li>
<li>Using the air conditioner when the car is not running.</li>
<li>Not starting a car for long periods of time (e.g., while it's in storage).</li>
<li>Lack of battery maintenance (e.g., not keeping terminals clean).</li>
<li>Failure of the diode bridge or voltage regulator in the alternator; the alternator charges the battery when the car is running.</li>
<li>Low air temperature, which causes batteries to freeze.</li>
</ul><h2>Who to call?</h2><p>If your battery does fail, there are a number of people and services you might want to turn to for assistance:</p><ul>
<li><b>Friends and family</b></li>
<li><b>Towing service</b></li>
<li><b>Auto club</b></li>
<li><b>Manufacturer's roadside assistance</b></li>

<p></p>
<p><b>Inverse current protection</b></p>
<p>You must disconnect clamps immediately with traditional jump starters to avoid a high inverse current destroying the battery cell. Since JumperZ is embedded with industry-leading IC chip to protect inverse current pulse, you have plenty of time (30s) to finish your jump start job.</p>
<p><b>Over Discharging Protection  </b></p>
<p>When JumperZ is disconnected from a car battery or mobile device, the Intelligent Power Management System (IPMS) will allow JumperZ go to sleep automatically to avoid over discharging.</p>
<p><b>Over Charging Protection</b></p>
<p>When JumperZ is fully charged, the IPMS will let JumperZ go to sleep automatically to avoid over charging. </p>
<p><b>Short circuit protection</b></p>
<p>If someone unintentionally connects the black and red clamp, the IPMS will cut off the power immediately to keep JumperZ from short circuiting.</p>
<p><b>Collision and impact protection</b></p>
<p>JumperZ will remain intact under extreme collision sand impacts.</p>
<h1><b>Fast Charging</b></h1>
<p>The IMPS inside JumperZ enables fast charging with CC/CV (Constant Current/Constant Voltage) mode which fully charges JumperZ in about 5 hours.</p>
<p>JumperZ gets charged much faster than traditional charging methods in the beginning CC phase. In the CC (Constant Current) phase the current is maintained at a constant level until the battery reaches the final charge voltage of 15 V. </p>

</div></div>","Never be inconvenienced by a dead car battery againHave you ever been in a situation when you needed to get to work or an important meeting, but your car wouldn't start? We have, and we're guessing it will eventually happen to you if it hasn't already. When such a situation arises, chances are that a dead or weak battery is the culprit.Why does a car battery die or weaken?There are a number of reasons why batteries can weaken and fail. A few common ones include:
Leaving headlights, interior lights, flashers, and the CD / radio on when the car isn't running.
Using the air conditioner when the car is not running.
Not starting a car for long periods of time (e.g., while it's in storage).
Lack of battery maintenance (e.g., not keeping terminals clean).
Failure of the diode bridge or voltage regulator in the alternator; the alternator charges the battery when the car is running.
Low air temperature, which causes batteries to freeze.
Who to call?If your battery does fail, there are a number of people and services you might want to turn to for assistance:
Friends and family
Towing service
Auto club
Manufacturer's roadside assistance
OrJumperZ - a tough palm-sized emergency battery rescuer.Designed specifically for vehicle jump starting applications, JumperZ provides extremely high power output, extended cranking power and a long service life.JumperZ's 400 peak Amps is powerful enough to jump start your motorcycle, car, boat, RV or tractor as long as the engine is under 3 liters in size with 12V battery. JumperZ works no matter how your vehicle is powered (gasoline, LPG or diesel).What size is JumperZ?By the way, a fully charged JumperZ could jump start cars more than 10 times.

Rescue at scene




How to jump start your vehicle


Emergency Rescuer Charging for Mobile Devices
Pre-disaster planning is essential, but our team hopes you will not have to use JumperZ often. We provide compact 7200mAh lithium-polymer battery cells with dual USB outputs making JumperZ ideal for mobile device emergencies. 
2.1A/1A dual USB outputs enable fast charging of two smartphones and tablets simultaneously.

7200mAh (triple 2400mAh cells) is the actual capacity for JumperZ, we do not try to bloat any amp to mislead you. It is enough to charge most smartphones 3 to 4 times.

<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">Campus Bike was created on the basis of supporting healthier and more environmentally friendly college campuses. Founded in August 2013, we focus on providing an innovative, inexpensive, and easy solution to a needed service on campuses; Bicycles. Most students do not own a bicycle, but have a need for one on a daily basis.</p>
<h4 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 18px !important; line-height: 24px !important;"">Who Are We? What Do We do?</h4>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">We provide a unique service that offers full service bicycle sharing stations across college campuses, with 24/7 access! We promote health and sustainability by providing an outlet to non-motorized modes of self powered transportation. We are currently in the process of designing and developing systems that will ultimately provide this automated 24/7 access. Our program and systems are tailored to specifically meet the needs of students, faculty, and visitors. They are different than many traditional systems, in that they utilize new and unique technologies such as quick release fingerprint scanners, solar technologies, airless tires on the bicycles, and include small release modules at each station for no wait, quick release.</p>
<h4 style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 18px !important; line-height: 24px !important;"">What is our plan?</h4>
<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">We first intend to implement 8-15 stations on Baylor Universities campus. Each station will contain approximately 20 bicycles, and 20 open slots for docking. A user can release a bicycle from one station, an return it to another with no problem. Our systems will also provide personal dashboards for all users, showing personal progress made while using our systems. Progress reports will include data such as miles riden, calories burned, CO2 emissions saved, etc. A large portion of proceeds generated from these stations will go to benefit new and emerging programs at the university. After our first round of implementation, we plan to move forward and scale our systems to other universities. </p><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">We understand that with a project like this, there are inherent risks.

<p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">After months of dedicated research and development, we have laid the groundwork and need to continue working with developers to take our business model from theory to reality.  The developers we’re working with will take the project forward by developing the integrated technology we know we need to make this project happen; Subsequently, all of these hardworking people need to be paid for their work. Our plan includes working with our in-house-team as well as outside development teams. Included on these teams are various project managers, engineers, (senior level, electro-mechanical, documentation control, etc) and experienced in-house software developers. .</p><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">Once our funding goal is met, our in-house software development team will be able to finish developing our unique cloud based software which tracks, reports and monitors users, bicycles, usage, maintenance, sensitive data, accounts, miles riden, CO2 emissions saved, calories burned, RDIF data, solar, battery usage and capacity, as well as other various functions.</p><p style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">Our contracted teams will be able to finish all of the hardware development, which includes a fully functional prototype of the station. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The
interface platform will be constructed of aluminum and/or steel and finished in
an industrial powder coat paint.  It will
have dimensions of approximately 16”W x 24”D x 84”H.  The interface platform will include a touch
screen monitor and mini PC w/Windows Embedded 7, a credit card swipe device, a
security camera, an ID scanner, a fingerprint reader, a cellular router, and
battery back-up in case of power failure. It will also provide a place near the top of
the cabinet to display the Campus Bike logo/branding illuminated with back
lighting. The kiosk will include an access door(s) that locks and when opened
will be used to service any of the hardware components. Space will be allocated
for future installation of solar battery power, however our initial design will
assume the stations will have access to a standard 110V power source. In
addition to the primary interface platform there will be 2- 3 smaller “release

Our ultimate goal is to help college kids get healthier and get to class faster while contributing to a greener future!  

Help us reach our goal of creating a healthier and more environmentally
sustainable future through the use of shared resources and efficient use of
property.


Why Was Campus Bike Started?
Campus Bike was created on the basis of supporting healthier and more environmentally friendly college campuses. Founded in August 2013, we focus on providing an innovative, inexpensive, and easy solution to a needed service on campuses; Bicycles. Most students do not own a bicycle, but have a need for one on a daily basis.
Who Are We? What Do We do?
We provide a unique service that offers full service bicycle sharing stations across college campuses, with 24/7 access! We promote health and sustainability by providing an outlet to non-motorized modes of self powered transportation. We are currently in the process of designing and developing systems that will ultimately provide this automated 24/7 access. Our program and systems are tailored to specifically meet the needs of students, faculty, and visitors. They are different than many traditional systems, in that they utilize new and unique technologies such as quick release fingerprint scanners, solar technologies, airless tires on the bicycles, and include small release modules at each station for no wait, quick release.
What is our plan?
We first intend to implement 8-15 stations on Baylor Universities campus. Each station will contain approximately 20 bicycles, and 20 open slots for docking. A user can release a bicycle from one station, an return it to another with no problem. Our systems will also provide personal dashboards for all users, showing personal progress made while using our systems. Progress reports will include data such as miles riden, calories burned, CO2 emissions saved, etc. A large portion of proceeds generated from these stations will go to benefit new and emerging programs at the university. After our first round of implementation, we plan to move forward and scale our systems to other universities. We understand that with a project like this, there are inherent risks. We have outlined most potential risks and how we plan to overcome them in our 60+ page business plan. We will put our full efforts and utilize all of our resources into overcoming any unforeseen complications that may arise.
Where are we now?
After months of dedicated research and development, we have laid the groundwork and need to continue working with developers to take our business model from theory to reality.  The developers we’re working with will take the project forward by developing the integrated technology we know we need to make this project happen; Subsequently, all of these hardworking people need to be paid for their work. Our plan includes working with our in-house-team as well as outside development teams. Included on these teams are various project managers, engineers, (senior level, electro-mechanical, documentation control, etc) and experienced in-house software developers. .Once our funding goal is met, our in-house software development team will be able to finish developing our unique cloud based software which tracks, reports and monitors users, bicycles, usage, maintenance, sensitive data, accounts, miles riden, CO2 emissions saved, calories burned, RDIF data, solar, battery usage and capacity, as well as other various functions.Our contracted teams will be able to finish all of the hardware development, which includes a fully functional prototype of the station. The
interface platform will be constructed of aluminum and/or steel and finished in
an industrial powder coat paint.  It will
have dimensions of approximately 16”W x 24”D x 84”H.  The interface platform will include a touch
screen monitor and mini PC w/Windows Embedded 7, a credit card swipe device, a
security camera, an ID scanner, a fingerprint reader, a cellular router, and
battery back-up in case of power failure. It will also provide a place near the top of
the cabinet to display the Campus Bike logo/branding illuminated with back
lighting. The kiosk will include an access door(s) that locks and when opened
will be used to service any of the hardware components. Space will be allocated
for future installation of solar battery power, however our initial design will
assume the stations will have access to a standard 110V power source. In
addition to the primary interface platform there will be 2- 3 smaller “release
stations”, each consisting of a fingerprint scanner, keypad to enter 4 digit code,
and card swipe for ID cards. These release stations will allow a user to “quick
release” a bicycle by simply using a fingerprint scan or card swipe. The
bicycle docking platform will provide stations for approximately 40 bicycles
and will include a locking system to secure each bicycle. The docking platform
will be modular with 5 modules to accommodate 8 bicycles each. This will allow
for configuration variations based on available space or site conditions.  It will also provide an RFID system to identify
the number of each bicycle, and a “repair” button that can be pushed to identify
a bicycle in need of repair.  The docking

<p>Have you heard of the Bike Repair Hub? We call it the Hub for short. It’s
located in the heart of New Columbia, an affordable housing community in North
Portland’s Portsmouth neighborhood where over 80% of families with children
live below the poverty line.  In New
Columbia, many people had bikes, but could not afford to fix them. They also
lived in a bike shop desert, with no place nearby to take their bikes. In 2012,
we helped transform a vacant lot into a place where locals can get their bikes
fixed, meet friends and go on bike rides, while learning bike maintenance and
mechanics. </p>
<p>This summer, we need your support. We are doubling the amount of hours
the Hub is open, which means fixing over 50 bikes a week. We’re leading more
bike rides for residents, adding more bike maintenance trainings, and debuting a
new program where people living on low incomes can build their own bikes with
the support of one of our professional mechanics.</p>
<p>The Hub is a real community effort that makes your heart feel good. With
the support of people like you who believe in access to bikes, more people will
ride bikes for transportation, recreation, and for fun.  Help the Hub double its hours today!</p>

<p>The idea for the electronic bike rack came to me when a friend had two bicycles stolen in one week. When the second bike was stolen the thief left a sticky note attached to the cut bike lock chain. The note had a smiley face and “THANKS” written across it. I agreed with my friend that the situation totally sucked because he really liked to ride bicycles. Then I thought ... How can I help out my friend?

<p>Coincidentally I was trying to find an idea for my engineering senior design project. After some research I found out ...

<u>Frequently Asked Questions</u><a name=""faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>
</h2>
<div><b>Q. How can you claim to lock up 90% of the bicycles on the market?</b></div>
<div>A. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The patented product was developed after analyzing hundreds of bicycles. It is built from a single point of continuity found for all bicycle frames.</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. Why can't I just use a regular bike lock?</b></div>
<div>A. You can... BUT research has shown that all bike locks on the market can be broken in 30 seconds or less. There are Youtube™  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=breaking+bike+locks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a> to demonstrate how to break the bike locks<span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><b>Q. What's wrong with just a regular bike rack?</b></div>
<div>A. Regular bike racks DO NOT LOCK UP BICYCLES. A regular bike rack is a ""hitching post"". Not much has changed since the days of riding horses. You are counting on the bike lock to secure your bike to the rack. See the above Q&amp;A for how effective a bike lock is. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. What is the electronic bike rack made of?</b></div>
<div>A. The electronic bike rack is a steel design weighing over 200 lbs. The locking arms are composed of a steel outer and inner sleeve containing an actuator. The center column contains a backup battery and the control system.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. How does the electronic bike rack ""lock up"" a bicycle?</b></div>
<div>A. First a person pushes their bicycle into the rack. Once the system is activated the rack extends a metal bar through the spokes of the wheel. There are bars in the reaching arms that extend down to stop the gated bars from swinging. This action creates a ""locking bar"" through the opening in the frame.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. What about locking the back wheel?</b></div>
<div>A. You can push a bicycle into the rack forwards OR backwards. It is possible to lock both wheels if you push the bicycle into the rack backwards. Then, depending on tire width, detach the front wheel and put it with the back wheel before engaging the lock.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. What happens if there is a loss of power in the area?</b></div>
<div>A. The backup batteries will keep the rack running for a few days. If the area around the rack and the rack itself looses power the electronic bike rack will stay in either the locked or unlocked position.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. Is there anything special about the ""electronic"" part of the bike rack?</b></div>
<div>A. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">No. All electronics used in the rack are ""off the shelf"".</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. How is the electronic bike rack controlled?</b></div>
<div>A. T<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he rack is controlled with a Raspberry Pi 2. It communicates with your phone app via Bluetooth LE and with a RFID reader for key card access.</span>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. How can the electronic bike rack run off solar power?</b></div>
<div>A. The whole device uses 12 volts and 2 amps of energy. A single solar panel can charge multiple racks.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. Where can the electronic bike racks be deployed?</b></div>
<div>A. The racks can go onto campuses, into metropolitan areas, hotel resorts and out on the trails or in parks. They can go anywhere there is a cell phone signal.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Q. What was the development process and how many prototypes did you build?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>A. The development process is illustrated in the Gallery section.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. Is anyone else electronically locking bicycles?</b></div>
<div>A. There are a growing number of bike locks entering the market that connect to a phone app and the internet. They can only tell you when your bicycle is being stolen. Others have created large structures using robots to ""file away"" bicycles. Bike shares electronically lock one specific type of bicycle they own.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. How is your device different than a bike share?</b></div>
<div>A. The electronic bike rack secures 90% of the bicycle market instead of just one bike. Each rack is controlled independently. The devices take up a fourth of the physical footprint space than a bike share station. One device secures two bikes instead of one bike. The clearance needed around the installed units is 60% less than the space needed for a bike share.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Q. Is the electronic bike rack just for parking my bicycle?</b></div>
<div>A. No. The product can be used to rent out bicycles at a resort, campus, beach, or from hotels. The electronic accessibility allows for reservation codes.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Q. Will you ship the electronic bike rack internationally?</b></div>
<div>A. Not at this time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Q. Why are 1% of all contributions going to the American Cancer Society?</b><br/>
</div>
<div>A. Last fall my mother was simultaneously diagnosed with lung and bone marrow cancer. Only ten years ago this would have been a death sentence. Due to modern advancements in cancer research she now only has to take pills and have a shot. Thankfully she does not need chemotherapy! </div>
<div>*FYI, If  you know anyone who, heaven forbid, gets cancer DO NOT look it up online. Everything online is 10 years out of date and will scare the crap out of you.</div>

Hello Everyone!
    
     





I'm Thad,


The idea for the electronic bike rack came to me when a friend had two bicycles stolen in one week. When the second bike was stolen the thief left a sticky note attached to the cut bike lock chain. The note had a smiley face and “THANKS” written across it. I agreed with my friend that the situation totally sucked because he really liked to ride bicycles. Then I thought ... How can I help out my friend?
  
Coincidentally I was trying to find an idea for my engineering senior design project. After some research I found out ... 
  

It's REALLY easy to steal a bicycle!



... ALL BECAUSE ...

All Bike Locks Broken in 30 Seconds.
United States Bicycle Theft
$350 Million Yearly Problem




Solution 
A patented outdoor Electronic Bike Rack that locks the wheel and frame of your bicycle. The rack prevents theft by integrating the bike lock into a bike rack. You can activate the rack with a cell phone app, key card, or attached kiosk.




Secures 90% of the bicycles on the market.

Able to run off solar power with a backup battery.
Modular design allows for multiple rack deployment. 
Steel design weighs 200 lbs and is bolted to the ground.

Frequently Asked Questions 

Q. How can you claim to lock up 90% of the bicycles on the market?
A. The patented product was developed after analyzing hundreds of bicycles. It is built from a single point of continuity found for all bicycle frames.


Q. Why can't I just use a regular bike lock?
A. You can... BUT research has shown that all bike locks on the market can be broken in 30 seconds or less. There are Youtube™  videos to demonstrate how to break the bike locks.


Q. What's wrong with just a regular bike rack?
A. Regular bike racks DO NOT LOCK UP BICYCLES. A regular bike rack is a ""hitching post"". Not much has changed since the days of riding horses. You are counting on the bike lock to secure your bike to the rack. See the above Q&A for how effective a bike lock is. 

Q. What is the electronic bike rack made of?
A. The electronic bike rack is a steel design weighing over 200 lbs. The locking arms are composed of a steel outer and inner sleeve containing an actuator. The center column contains a backup battery and the control system.

Q. How does the electronic bike rack ""lock up"" a bicycle?
A. First a person pushes their bicycle into the rack. Once the system is activated the rack extends a metal bar through the spokes of the wheel. There are bars in the reaching arms that extend down to stop the gated bars from swinging. This action creates a ""locking bar"" through the opening in the frame.

Q. What about locking the back wheel?
A. You can push a bicycle into the rack forwards OR backwards. It is possible to lock both wheels if you push the bicycle into the rack backwards. Then, depending on tire width, detach the front wheel and put it with the back wheel before engaging the lock.

Q. What happens if there is a loss of power in the area?
A. The backup batteries will keep the rack running for a few days. If the area around the rack and the rack itself looses power the electronic bike rack will stay in either the locked or unlocked position.

Q. Is there anything special about the ""electronic"" part of the bike rack?
A. No. All electronics used in the rack are ""off the shelf"".


Q. How is the electronic bike rack controlled?
A. The rack is controlled with a Raspberry Pi 2. It communicates with your phone app via Bluetooth LE and with a RFID reader for key card access.


Q. How can the electronic bike rack run off solar power?
A. The whole device uses 12 volts and 2 amps of energy. A single solar panel can charge multiple racks.

Q. Where can the electronic bike racks be deployed?
A. The racks can go onto campuses, into metropolitan areas, hotel resorts and out on the trails or in parks. They can go anywhere there is a cell phone signal.


Q. What was the development process and how many prototypes did you build?

A. The development process is illustrated in the Gallery section.

Q. Is anyone else electronically locking bicycles?
A. There are a growing number of bike locks entering the market that connect to a phone app and the internet. They can only tell you when your bicycle is being stolen. Others have created large structures using robots to ""file away"" bicycles. Bike shares electronically lock one specific type of bicycle they own.

Q. How is your device different than a bike share?
A. The electronic bike rack secures 90% of the bicycle market instead of just one bike. Each rack is controlled independently. The devices take up a fourth of the physical footprint space than a bike share station. One device secures two bikes instead of one bike. The clearance needed around the installed units is 60% less than the space needed for a bike share.

Q. Is the electronic bike rack just for parking my bicycle?
A. No. The product can be used to rent out bicycles at a resort, campus, beach, or from hotels. The electronic accessibility allows for reservation codes.

Q. Will you ship the electronic bike rack internationally?
A. Not at this time.


Q. Why are 1% of all contributions going to the American Cancer Society?

A. Last fall my mother was simultaneously diagnosed with lung and bone marrow cancer. Only ten years ago this would have been a death sentence. Due to modern advancements in cancer research she now only has to take pills and have a shot. Thankfully she does not need chemotherapy! 
*FYI, If  you know anyone who, heaven forbid, gets cancer DO NOT look it up online. Everything online is 10 years out of date and will scare the crap out of you.
