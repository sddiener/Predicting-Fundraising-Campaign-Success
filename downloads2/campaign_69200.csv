California has been a pioneer in this expansion. These pricier artisan spirits are a growing niche of the $60-billion US spirit market, with 2% of sales last year. The volume of craft spirits produced has nearly doubled in the least two years. A new law signed last week by Governor Jerry Brown could push California craft distillers even more mainstream. The craft Distillers act of 2015 allows spirit makers to sell up to three bottles [per person, per day] of their alcohol from tasting rooms and operate an on-site bar and restaurant for the first time. The industry has changed dramatically over the last two decades as consumers preferences changed. Momentum continued to build as more customers turned to local sources for food and expected the same from their spirits, leading to greater demand for craft distillers. Orange County is the last frontier, just because there isn't anybody. There definitely is a need</i><span style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px;"">."" </span></p>

<h3>About Us</h3>Constantine (Gus) Samios II first learned the art of distilling with his great grandfathers <a href=""http://www.pleasuredistillery.com/---story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fire-bombed still</a> when he was 12 years old. He's been boiling mash and wine ever since. After graduating from the University of San Diego, Samios launched a string of successful California businesses that each played a significant part in spawning entirely new industries. With a three generation background in distilling and a clear vision of new industry development, Gus (and Cheryl!) have proudly poised <b><i>Pleasure Distillery</i></b> both domestically and internationally to move the world from chemical heavy industrial alcohols to smooth local field-to-bottle fine spirits.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449703663/vijnpip16pdakenx7mzd.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 328px; height: 328px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450136761/gwnnbt86ls75jj90gw5n.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 249.10519645120405px; height: 332px;""/></p>Joining Samios in botanical pairing is California Culinary Institute graduate, Michelin rated chef, and Zagat rated fine California cuisine restaurant owner, <a href=""http://www.nicksnextdoor.com/whos-nick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nick Difu</a>.

Our roots are deepest in Laguna Beach, La Jolla, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Our minds are always on close friends, adventure, independence, and discovery. The ocean and the sky are our playgrounds. <b><i>Pleasure</i></b> Spirits are all this in a bottle.</div><div>Our Pearl Street Rum is made from fresh cut California sugar cane. Our Pacific Sea Grass Absinthe is an innovative smooth high proof version of the mystic spirit. Our California Blue Agave is home grown right here at our central California seaside ranch - we are one of the first and only California agave producers. Consider the best wines in the world shifted from France and Italy to our west coast. The best beers in the world shifted from Germany to the US. With your help, we aim to bring the best agave spirit production to California. This goal is an industry changer. <br/>

Our hearts know there are no short cuts to perfection. We don't buy commercially distilled bulk alcohol and we don't infuse our spirits with flavoring to mask harmful congeners (impurities). Our stills are hand made in the US entirely of copper for a cleaner more pure taste than the steel stills commonly used. Our distillation runs are done in single small batches each independently tested &amp; tasted with precise family secret ""cuts"" to remove toxins. Our water is fresh high sierra snow melt brought down direct from Lake Tahoe. These are just some of the critical measures we live by to make our clean smooth spirits. Tradition &amp; Innovation.

<h3>What's Different About Pleasure?</h3>
Pure central California coast grown agave, fresh valley sugar cane, Santa Cruz mountain grapes, Pacific sea grass, meticulous fermentation, hand made copper stills, maximum toxin removal, precise small batch distillation technique, and lots of drop-by-drop love.</div><div>If you're wondering what kind of harmful chemicals we've all been drinking all these years and wishing your spirits could be smooth and stripped of toxins, then you've come to the right place. We apply both the old school taste, smell, &amp; texture method taught to us from a century of family distilling tradition combined with the refined fermentation techniques we grew up with in coastal wine country. This allows us to make cleaner and smoother spirits with minimal toxicity. To do this it takes innovative time consuming steps [and a few family secrets] that the old mass production booze manufacturers will not even consider.</div><div>We love tradition. The funny thing about California is that our tradition is innovation.<p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449708723/vzczfmuuyqnd6m9x7ozc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 179.52127659574467px; height: 135px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449709030/zqw9oni6uls8sltgfaaz.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 208.4060606060606px; height: 137px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449709620/knu7dgmomc8ez63yu3zg.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; width: 188px; height: 141px;""/></p>

<h3>Our Distillery</h3>The notion of <b><i>Pleasure Distillery</i></b> started in a modified outdoor shower at Pleasure Point, California back in 1976.</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Decades later, we took our passion for underground R&amp;D inside a retired yacht building hanger outside a small outlaw section of town soaked in surf, sailing, smuggling, and adventure roots just up the coast from the Baja border. Our neighborhood was steeped in classic surf history and the original home to both The Surfers Journal and Surfer Magazine. Not to mention surf visionary Hobie Alter and adventure film producer Bruce Brown. Our direction was inspired by our neighbors of world class boat builders, Catalina island sailors, channel crossing watermen, and infamous surf board shapers. All indy adventurers using the natural resources around them to create perfection.</span>

</div></div>","Pleasure Distillery is a craft distiller in Laguna Beach, California. Pleasure is friends, purity, adventure, independence, & discovery in a bottle. Each of our spirits are created entirely from fresh California coastal homegrown ingredients. Our agave, rum, and absinthe recipes are classics combining tradition and innovation. We have three generations of distilling in our blood and a lifetime of vintner experience. Our distillation runs are done in single small batches each with precise family secret ""cuts"" to remove harmful congeners for your drinking Pleasure. With your help, we are just months away from having our bottles on shelves.



""In the midst of a Renaissance for careful crafted spirits, artisan distillers have boomed across the nation...California has been a pioneer in this expansion.""


                                                                                      
 ""In the midst of a Renaissance for carefully crafted spirits, artisan distilleries have boomed in California and across the nation. California has been a pioneer in this expansion. These pricier artisan spirits are a growing niche of the $60-billion US spirit market, with 2% of sales last year. The volume of craft spirits produced has nearly doubled in the least two years. A new law signed last week by Governor Jerry Brown could push California craft distillers even more mainstream. The craft Distillers act of 2015 allows spirit makers to sell up to three bottles [per person, per day] of their alcohol from tasting rooms and operate an on-site bar and restaurant for the first time. The industry has changed dramatically over the last two decades as consumers preferences changed. Momentum continued to build as more customers turned to local sources for food and expected the same from their spirits, leading to greater demand for craft distillers. Orange County is the last frontier, just because there isn't anybody. There definitely is a need."" 

About UsConstantine (Gus) Samios II first learned the art of distilling with his great grandfathers fire-bombed still when he was 12 years old. He's been boiling mash and wine ever since. After graduating from the University of San Diego, Samios launched a string of successful California businesses that each played a significant part in spawning entirely new industries. With a three generation background in distilling and a clear vision of new industry development, Gus (and Cheryl!) have proudly poised Pleasure Distillery both domestically and internationally to move the world from chemical heavy industrial alcohols to smooth local field-to-bottle fine spirits.  Joining Samios in botanical pairing is California Culinary Institute graduate, Michelin rated chef, and Zagat rated fine California cuisine restaurant owner, Nick Difu. Nick is a master chef featured in publications including the San Jose Mercury News and The New Yorker magazine. Nick's unique talent for pairing fresh California ingredients has allowed us to create classic spirit recipes with the smoothest finish.
Council for Pleasure is managed by Michael Parson. Parsons is a graduate of UC Santa Barbara with extensive legal and operational background as Council and Chief Operations Officer at multiple food and medical related businesses featuring all natural base ingredients. Mike also lets Pleasure grow our own blue agave on his 50 acre seaside California ranch. Pleasure blue agave is the ONLY California grown pure agave spirit in the world.




About YouWith your backing, you can know the impact you'll have on us, our community, all small businesses, and the future of the clean farm-to-bottle movement is bigger than words can explain. And, the world will see your name posted, burned, or carved on our distillery walls forever to prove it.
We follow the more-than-you-expected policy. Each of our backers, big or small, will be a permanent part of our distillery whether it be a DISTILLER tee shirt, a signed 1st batch bottle, a personal bar stool, your name etched on one of our fermentation tanks, or even the experience of being Master Distiller for a Day.
   The Products You're Helping Us Make 

                        We make what we are.  Our lives have been spent living in small surf towns along the California coastline. Our roots are deepest in Laguna Beach, La Jolla, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. Our minds are always on close friends, adventure, independence, and discovery. The ocean and the sky are our playgrounds. Pleasure Spirits are all this in a bottle.Our Pearl Street Rum is made from fresh cut California sugar cane. Our Pacific Sea Grass Absinthe is an innovative smooth high proof version of the mystic spirit. Our California Blue Agave is home grown right here at our central California seaside ranch - we are one of the first and only California agave producers. Consider the best wines in the world shifted from France and Italy to our west coast. The best beers in the world shifted from Germany to the US. With your help, we aim to bring the best agave spirit production to California. This goal is an industry changer. 

Each of our spirits is designed to be a classic created entirely from the California coastal area plants we love the most. Our hearts know there are no short cuts to perfection. We don't buy commercially distilled bulk alcohol and we don't infuse our spirits with flavoring to mask harmful congeners (impurities). Our stills are hand made in the US entirely of copper for a cleaner more pure taste than the steel stills commonly used. Our distillation runs are done in single small batches each independently tested & tasted with precise family secret ""cuts"" to remove toxins. Our water is fresh high sierra snow melt brought down direct from Lake Tahoe. These are just some of the critical measures we live by to make our clean smooth spirits. Tradition & Innovation. We are the next generation of distillers.



What's Different About Pleasure?
Pure central California coast grown agave, fresh valley sugar cane, Santa Cruz mountain grapes, Pacific sea grass, meticulous fermentation, hand made copper stills, maximum toxin removal, precise small batch distillation technique, and lots of drop-by-drop love.If you're wondering what kind of harmful chemicals we've all been drinking all these years and wishing your spirits could be smooth and stripped of toxins, then you've come to the right place. We apply both the old school taste, smell, & texture method taught to us from a century of family distilling tradition combined with the refined fermentation techniques we grew up with in coastal wine country. This allows us to make cleaner and smoother spirits with minimal toxicity. To do this it takes innovative time consuming steps [and a few family secrets] that the old mass production booze manufacturers will not even consider.We love tradition. The funny thing about California is that our tradition is innovation.      

            


Our DistilleryThe notion of Pleasure Distillery started in a modified outdoor shower at Pleasure Point, California back in 1976.
Decades later, we took our passion for underground R&D inside a retired yacht building hanger outside a small outlaw section of town soaked in surf, sailing, smuggling, and adventure roots just up the coast from the Baja border. Our neighborhood was steeped in classic surf history and the original home to both The Surfers Journal and Surfer Magazine. Not to mention surf visionary Hobie Alter and adventure film producer Bruce Brown. Our direction was inspired by our neighbors of world class boat builders, Catalina island sailors, channel crossing watermen, and infamous surf board shapers. All indy adventurers using the natural resources around them to create perfection.
             
       
      As we grew into being a licensed distillery, we moved our hand made copper still to our home town of Laguna Beach. Our expanded factory has space to hold our new fermentation tanks, boiler, chiller, barrels, and soon our second 250 gallon US made copper production still (this is where you come in!).
Pleasure Distillery is now permanently located on hidden Laguna Canyon Road - an old windy two lane stretch into Laguna Beach. Our small surf town hosts several renown destination bars and restaurants. While privately nestled along the coast behind a web of canyons, Pleasure Distillery is centered directly in the middle of the three most populated counties in California (Los Angeles, Orange, & San Diego).

Acha que cafés, estações de serviço, espalhadas, receções de
hotel são o local certo para reuniões? Consegue separar o seu horário de
trabalho do seu horário de lazer? Consegue crescer e obter novos clientes a um
ritmo gratificante? Estes são alguns dos problemas que encontro enquanto
trabalhador a partir de casa.
O Outpost pretende ser um local de networking, sala de
reuniões em Vila do Conde para empresas e trabalhadores independentes da área
das novas tecnologias. Projetado para pequenas empresas e profissionais
pretendemos oferecer um espaço de luxo e profissional com Wifi de cortesia,
bebidas, chá e café. A nossa equipa conta com 2 profissionais, ligados ao comércio
internacional, que irão ajudar a rede de talentos do Outpost a captar novas oportunidades de negócio.
O nosso objetivo é simples: fazer com que os nossos membros
e os seus negócios tenham mais sucesso proporcionando um espaço de trabalho e
networking de qualidade sem os seus custos elevados associados. Pretendemos
ser uma grande equipa internacional. Iremos apresentar o Outpost internacionalmente como uma equipa recheada de talentos disposta a oferecer os seus serviços.
Pretendemos que os membros do Outpost sejam brilhantes, bem-sucedidos,
pessoas inspiradas e que inspirem ao seu redor. Pretendemos todo o tipo de
profissionais TI com qualquer nível de educação. Outpost não será apenas um escritório mas sim um lugar onde podem compartilhar ideias e projetos. Ao fim
do dia queremos que todos deixem o Outpost inspirados e felizes.
No Outpost iremos ter inúmeros eventos orientados em ajudar
as pessoas a aprender a ser melhores empresários e para se conectar com outros,
tais como workshops, sessões de brainstorming, grupos de discussão, formações e
muito mais.
Ajude-nos a criar o Outpost, porque somos esforçados, entusiastas
e sonhadores. Ao apoiar Outpost estará a apoiar a comunidade e a comunidade é algo
mais do que negócios.
Uso do capital
Dos recursos captados, vamos abrir o 1º Outpost em Vila do
Conde (bem próximo da Póvoa de Varzim) com parque de estacionamento, estação de
metro a menos de 200m, CTT e bancos a 500m.

The less nature you have involved, the more systematic and precise I am allowed to be so that I can grow the plants in the best way possible, and this is where the business idea originated.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>I am currently looking to scale this business to a size that can handle farmer's markets, home delivery, monthly subscriptions, and restaurants, with wholesale being down the road.  I plan to start production flat in greenhouses, and moving to the vertical indoor locations as business grows.</div><div>
<br/>With this Indiegogo campaign I will be able to hit the ground running with 3 greenhouses in different locations.  Each will be around 1000 sq ft and in different parts of Louisville so that delivery and pickup can be just minutes from production.  I already have one up and running, but needs hydroponics inside.  The other two I plan to buy used frames, put new plastic and end walls, and fill with hydroponic equipment as well.  By doing all the labor myself I will save a lot of the construction costs.  With about $7,000 of my own funds I have already built an experimental passive solar greenhouse in my backyard with my vertical rack system inside, and have purchased the hydroponic channels for all three greenhouses, totaling around 4,500 plant sites.</div><div>What I still need is the money for:</div><div>Frames for greenhouses: $3,000</div><div>End walls, fans, plastic, and ground cover: $3,000</div><div>Nutrient dosers, drains, and reservoirs: $4,000</div><div>Any amount we go over the goal will go directly into these locations, or be used to start towards the indoor location.  The more that's raised, the quicker I can scale, which in turn means the more I can grow!</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>I would like for you to fund this project because of the limitless possibility this technology has in our community today and for the future.  With the exponential growth of the human population, traditional farming will need support with an infrastructure of hyper local micro farms so we can get fresh food to everyone.  This is especially important in places that are food deserts, or urban areas that are heavily populated, but have no access to fresh food.  These systems can go anywhere and be operated by trained people very quickly.  I am starting small, and plan to grow with demand as it reaches my business.  We have the information at hand that proves demand for fresh, local produce is real and growing rapidly.  This business solves many of the issues people have which causes them to currently not buy local: seasonal changes, not enough supply, or lack of consistency, which is important to consumers and businesses alike.  I don't want to think of buying local as doing the right thing to make you feel good, I want it to be the best decision from a business perspective.</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>There are always risks when it comes to starting a new venture, but I have thoroughly tested this idea with many people I know and people I don't.  I believe that starting small in a couple of greenhouses and then moving to a larger centralized location lowers any kind of risk and keeps my upfront costs extremely low, without sacrificing production.</div>
<div>I know there are other businesses similar to mine out there but they won't be able to have the multiple, hyper-local locations like I will.  I want people to be able to walk down the street for fresh food any time of year and it be available to them.  The market size for fresh produce has more than enough room for a new player like myself and I am excited to get in the mix.</div>
<div>I take this venture very seriously and haven't been more passionate about anything else in my life.  I've always been using my array of skills and abilities to do things for others but this is by far my most impactful.  Getting fresh food to people and they know where it comes from is extremely satisfying to me and I would love to do it for a very long time.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>So what can you do even if you don't contribute?  Get the word out, check out my Facebook page, share the website, and just tell anyone know who wants to know where their food comes from to talk to me!  As soon as people know about what I'm doing, they will see the potential and hopefully want to bring this idea to a reality as well.</div>

With this Indiegogo campaign I will be able to hit the ground running with 3 greenhouses in different locations.  Each will be around 1000 sq ft and in different parts of Louisville so that delivery and pickup can be just minutes from production.  I already have one up and running, but needs hydroponics inside.  The other two I plan to buy used frames, put new plastic and end walls, and fill with hydroponic equipment as well.  By doing all the labor myself I will save a lot of the construction costs.  With about $7,000 of my own funds I have already built an experimental passive solar greenhouse in my backyard with my vertical rack system inside, and have purchased the hydroponic channels for all three greenhouses, totaling around 4,500 plant sites.What I still need is the money for:Frames for greenhouses: $3,000End walls, fans, plastic, and ground cover: $3,000Nutrient dosers, drains, and reservoirs: $4,000Any amount we go over the goal will go directly into these locations, or be used to start towards the indoor location.  The more that's raised, the quicker I can scale, which in turn means the more I can grow!  The Impact I would like for you to fund this project because of the limitless possibility this technology has in our community today and for the future.  With the exponential growth of the human population, traditional farming will need support with an infrastructure of hyper local micro farms so we can get fresh food to everyone.  This is especially important in places that are food deserts, or urban areas that are heavily populated, but have no access to fresh food.  These systems can go anywhere and be operated by trained people very quickly.  I am starting small, and plan to grow with demand as it reaches my business.  We have the information at hand that proves demand for fresh, local produce is real and growing rapidly.  This business solves many of the issues people have which causes them to currently not buy local: seasonal changes, not enough supply, or lack of consistency, which is important to consumers and businesses alike.  I don't want to think of buying local as doing the right thing to make you feel good, I want it to be the best decision from a business perspective.  Risks & Challenges
There are always risks when it comes to starting a new venture, but I have thoroughly tested this idea with many people I know and people I don't.  I believe that starting small in a couple of greenhouses and then moving to a larger centralized location lowers any kind of risk and keeps my upfront costs extremely low, without sacrificing production.
I know there are other businesses similar to mine out there but they won't be able to have the multiple, hyper-local locations like I will.  I want people to be able to walk down the street for fresh food any time of year and it be available to them.  The market size for fresh produce has more than enough room for a new player like myself and I am excited to get in the mix.
I take this venture very seriously and haven't been more passionate about anything else in my life.  I've always been using my array of skills and abilities to do things for others but this is by far my most impactful.  Getting fresh food to people and they know where it comes from is extremely satisfying to me and I would love to do it for a very long time.
    Other Ways You Can Help
So what can you do even if you don't contribute?  Get the word out, check out my Facebook page, share the website, and just tell anyone know who wants to know where their food comes from to talk to me!  As soon as people know about what I'm doing, they will see the potential and hopefully want to bring this idea to a reality as well.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We study the art of Nagasu Nami, or ""Draining Wave"". Our concentration is on functional technique usable by anyone, regardless of size or stature. With it's roots in Aikido and Chinese Kung Fu, Nagasu as an art focuses on inner strength and development. Each of our classes end with a dedication to our personal sense of Mercy, Compassion and Our Highest Selves. </p>
<p>We strive to teach to each and every student, be they large or small, experienced or green, in shape or not... We believe that the art itself is made whole by the students involved. </p>

<p>It is important to emphasize the personal and subjective quality of the martial arts, understanding that the ""art"" portion comes from a practitioner's deeply personal relationship with their own bodies and minds.

<p>We also need to be able to market and advertise this school locally. While we have grown well through word of mouth,  we have never had the funding to do any type of advertising.

<p>The violence, mistrust and flames that are being fanned that is clearly creating more division between the cops and their community. </p>
<p>Not since the civil rights movement has there been more controversy surrounding racism, law enforcement and the widening gap of mistrust. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, bad news always travels faster and is shared more often than the good deeds that cops are doing. Which brought us to a radical and time-tested solution. More about that in a minute...</p>
<p>Randy Sutton is a retired law enforcement officer, best selling author, sought after speaker and advisor. In past few months, like all of us, he watched the country become more divided as cops and citizens were both being wrongfully accused and even killed.</p>
<p>While most people shake their head, voice an opinion or share a politically edited video on Facebook, Randy knew the truth...The propaganda enflaming this issue is not only ineffective, but the videos, memes and reports are often edited to <b>advance a political agenda</b> &amp; incite more distrust, fear and violence.</p>
<p>No matter which ""side"" you are on, there are powerful forces pushing our country into the direction of fear and illusion...the illusion that all police are out to ""get us"" or are that all police jack booted thugs with an axe to grind.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The negative propaganda has to stop.</b></p>
<p>Angel Shields does not choose between cops and victims....in the spirit of all great leaders and movements, the foundation of Angel Shields is unity.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>It's Time to Unite the People and Their Police</b></p>
<p>This campaign is more than a membership card that cops nationwide will soon recognize and support. A citizen's membership will do more than help send a cop's kid to college or pay for uninsured medical expenses.</p>
<p>Angel shields will rebuild our country.</p>
<p>This is a grass roots effort and your support will do more than simply give you a ""Get out of jail free"" card (It's not designed for that).

</div></div>","It's not a ""get out of jail free"" card

....but it could be. 
Social media, mass media and the flood of controversy surrounding police brutality, law enforcement scandal, the thankless job of being a cop, etc. is polluting our communities.
It's time for POSITIVE ACTION.
The violence, mistrust and flames that are being fanned that is clearly creating more division between the cops and their community. 
Not since the civil rights movement has there been more controversy surrounding racism, law enforcement and the widening gap of mistrust. 
Unfortunately, bad news always travels faster and is shared more often than the good deeds that cops are doing. Which brought us to a radical and time-tested solution. More about that in a minute...
Randy Sutton is a retired law enforcement officer, best selling author, sought after speaker and advisor. In past few months, like all of us, he watched the country become more divided as cops and citizens were both being wrongfully accused and even killed.
While most people shake their head, voice an opinion or share a politically edited video on Facebook, Randy knew the truth...The propaganda enflaming this issue is not only ineffective, but the videos, memes and reports are often edited to advance a political agenda & incite more distrust, fear and violence.
No matter which ""side"" you are on, there are powerful forces pushing our country into the direction of fear and illusion...the illusion that all police are out to ""get us"" or are that all police jack booted thugs with an axe to grind.
The negative propaganda has to stop.
Angel Shields does not choose between cops and victims....in the spirit of all great leaders and movements, the foundation of Angel Shields is unity.
The spirit, intent and actionable items supporting Angel Shields is built on a foundation of truth, fairness, honor and community.
It's Time to Unite the People and Their Police
This campaign is more than a membership card that cops nationwide will soon recognize and support. A citizen's membership will do more than help send a cop's kid to college or pay for uninsured medical expenses.
Angel shields will rebuild our country.
This is a grass roots effort and your support will do more than simply give you a ""Get out of jail free"" card (It's not designed for that). What your membership WILL do, however, is let law enforcement know you are one of the good guys...a citizen who cares.   What We Need & What You Get
Basic membership will give you a bumper sticker, window sticker and membership card. Recognized by law enforcement, you'll be known as a supporter of the truth, fairness, honor and community. (It may even get you out of a speeding ticket! .... no guarantees though!)
Basic membership ($10) will do the following:


Community education and outreach programs

A general fund to help cops with uninsured medical expenses

A local fund so cops can give out gift cards to homeless or people in need


Premium membership ($97) will give you the above benefits PLUS you'll get access to our private Facebook community and discounts on all products, upgrades, services, firearm training, apparel and more by Angel Shields.

VIP membership ($497) will give you the above benefits PLUS you'll be featured as a contributor for our ""Police Plus"" program where we help cops with emergency funds. You will be a co-sponsor of local events (great PR for you or your company) and your support will be showcased on FOX, ABC, NBC and other news channels.

You can sponsor group events, defense training and you will get a ""Platinum"" badge honoring your commitment to peace, honor and service. In addition, patrons will get ""Back stage"" access to events, community and political contacts.BONUS: You'll be invited to a group video chat with Angel Shields founder, Randy Sutton.
If we fall short of our crowdfunding goal, all funds will continue to support the Angel Shields initiative. But, with your support, we expect to meet and exceed our funding goals.
   The Impact Imagine a world where the people...ALL of the people in ANY community look at their police as faithful servants-not bullies. It's not a dream, it's our unyielding goal.
Imagine a country where the police...ALL of the police in ANY community work with their citizens and encourage community involvement, trust and service above self.

The ""We Cook concept: 
All meals are prepared at our kitchen by our chef and delivered to your home ready to heat 'n eat.







Ready to try our chef-inspired recipes?


                                            


We have successfully created a program that solves a simple daily problem: what’s for dinner?  This is the classic example of the mother of invention being necessity.  With our flawlessly designed website and innovative solution we have simplified a process that is as essential as the meals we provide. We believe our dedication to quality will differentiate ourselves and make us something you are proud to have in your home.


“What’s for dinner?” is the age old question, but it is so important to feed your body the nutrition it needs to take on the long week ahead.  But getting the fresh food to your table is not always an easy task. That is where we come in. Our meal delivery services gives you the nutrition you need in a seamless process.  All you have to do is choose what you would like shipped - ready-to-cook or ready-to-ear - and when you want it ready.  It's really that simple!



About Us
We are Thierry and Marie and we are here to tell you about “Myfoodisgood®”. As you can probably relate, getting dinner on the table every night is not always easy. And getting a delicious home-cooked meal is even tougher. You should be excited about the food you are eating and chances are it is nothing but a hassle.   That is why I have created “Myfoodisgood®” and now anyone can get home cooked meals delivered to their house with ease. 
Enjoy cooking instead? Well we have something for you too! You have the option to buy the food cooked or ready-to-cook. So you can choose to cook yourself or have a ready-made meal. Either way you will have delicious food delivered to your home, ready for dinner.

<p><br/></p>
<p>First and most important <b>Street Pay</b> is a financial system based on speed, reliability and  trust.<br/></p>
<p>The vision of ""<b>StreetPay</b>"" is to emulate   true life  real time exchange experience  of cash  on the streets,  where if you do not know or a person you will not give them your money...""<b>StreetPay</b>"" will be based on the same theory, If you do not know  the person you are sending money to then do not send it to them, the same way you would not just give money to just anyone on the street is the same way that ""<b>Street Pay</b>""  will operate. <br/></p>
<p><b>Street Pay is about financial character, </b>but at a  more useful and forgiving scale  than credit scores, the reality is that some people will actually be able to go further in life financially with ""<b>Street Pay</b>""  than with credit scores.</p>
<p><b>Why ? Because Street Pay will be totally live and always in real time </b><br/></p>
<p>If an individual is proven to be trust worthy ? They will receive feedback that can never be changed, like a ""<b>street rep</b>"" or ""<b>street reputation</b>"". This way people will know that this is a person that can be trusted and relied on to deliver or keep to the agreement that was made before the money was exchanged  because this particular user has a ""<b>Good Reputation</b>"" ....</p>
<p>If an individual has a ""<b>Bad Reputation</b>"" with, welshing or  borrowing money and not returning it ? They will receive ""<b>Bad Reputation </b>"" marks.  After they tally up to a certain amount of ""<b>Bad Reps</b>"" ? The user may be banned forever or at least until they pay their debt to the user that initial gave them money from the system. When a user corrects an error that they made they will be reinstated and next to or in place of the <b>""Bad Reputation"" </b> mark will be the term ""<b>Made Right</b>"" with the time frame that it took for the user to correct the error</p>
<p> (example) ""<b>B.R Made Right 1/2015-9/2015</b>""</p>
<p>This way even if someone made a mistake ? Other users will know that they corrected it, and other users of the system will know the time frame that  it took for them to correct it, from beginning to end. Which is honorable. The faster that a user corrects his error is the quicker that they can move along with business on the system. As no one would trust anyone who took 2 years to pay back $50 dollars, it will always be in a users best interest to move fast, in order to keep a ""<b>Good Reputation</b>"" . <br/></p>
<p>A banned user will have no way  to re-enter the system, as the  system will be based on bio-metric identification.  One person will always only be allowed to own one <b>SP  </b>account, whether for business or personal use, users can add other users to their accounts but they will be responsible for their actions. So if you would not trust someone your wallet or purse ?, We would highly advise not giving them control or access over your ""<b>StreetPay</b>"" account.. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why do We Need Street Pay ?</b><br/></p>
<p>Our economy needs to be stimulated, but not only by government stimulus packages but instead by a  way that money can be transferred around digitally, but in  a constant state of live motion ... <br/></p>
<p>Presently costs continue to incur as money is frozen or stopped and opportunities to make more money are lost in the process. Many opportunities come around every once in a blue moon and one of the worst excuses to losing that money or opportunity is that it was being held by a corporation that merely wanted to falsely inflate its capital gain  holdings for stock and investment purposes. <br/></p>
<p><b>Street Pay</b> is a way for people to conduct person to person or business to business money transfers, without all of the stops, checks and fees that have been caused by corrupt banks and hedge fund investors. <br/></p>
<p><b>Street Pay </b>does not and will not  hold its users money  to gain interest on it  and beef up the company's value for stock purposes  at the cost of the users who use the online service. <br/></p>
<p>We can guarantee this because unlike all other competitors ?  <b>Street Pay</b> will not have investors,  it will have users who are charged a small fee to transfer money, those fees will be deposited in a bank account and used  for maintenance of the ""<b>Street Pay</b>"" system which will include <strong>(CE) Compensation for employees</strong> and for <b>insurance capital</b>  in case any emergency issues  were to arise  that would require the company to have to compensate users who may have been compromised and incurred a loss directly caused by the system..</p>
<p><b>Street Pay</b> is a self reliant fast paced, real time  money transfer system, that our global economy needs right now.  We need to sharpen the financial iq that is the norm among people now, most people are restricted and too relaxed with the restrictions  <br/></p>
<p>We want all users to feel safe, secure and to always have a good experience with the SP system, we also want hedge fund investors and crooked bankers kicked out of the business of investing in banks and forced to have to invest in traditional businesses that create jobs and broaden the prosperity of our our global economy... <br/></p>
<p><b>Street Pay</b> has the potential to really speed things up economically in the U.S and abroad, the system will be simple enough for a five year old to use and their parents could actually use the system to give their children an allowance... <br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Unlike Bankers and Hedge Fund investors, the Goal of ""StreetPay"" is not about making money from People, it is about helping people to make Money for themselves and have a better opportunity to  live their lives without having worry or feel restricted by someone trying to make a personal profit from their dollar <br/></b></b></h3>
<p>If we eliminate what I call monarch investors from investing in money systems like loan sharks ? Then money can flow as it should and other ideas that people have can easily be made into realities, that will serve to make our global economy stronger and its work force multiply.  <br/></p>

<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Since I have taken care of boys and girls, I have noticed a divide between how the latter are expected to learn (what, when &amp; how), as opposed to that of the former. A lot of girls show an early interest in STEM, but are not encouraged to follow that path. And as we all know, certain encouragement comes from the toys with which one is allowed to play. Many of these girls are not exposed to technology-based toys idiosyncratic to their gender. </p>

<ul><ul>
<li>American Indians/Natives, Black African Americans, and Hispanics/Latinas (non-White) make up a smaller share of the science and engineering workforce, with 10% of workers in science and engineering occupations and 13% of science and engineering degree holders in 2011, than their proportion in the general population, with 26% of U.S. population age 21 and older.</li>
<li>Asians work in science and engineering occupations at higher rates (19%) than their representation in the U.S. working-age population (5%). Asians are particularly highly concentrated in computer and information science occupations (22% Asian).<b>*</b>

</div></div>","My Story
Hello, my name is Ketura. 
I consider myself, somewhat, a ""Jackie of all trades"". Specifically, I have worked in some form or other in financial and data preparations, retrievals & applications, the computer sciences, and other technology-based positions at companies like IBM (was a process manager), Bank of America and the Meredith Corporation. However, the position which vastly honed my STEM skills - in addition to my ""expertise"" in art, craft & design - has been that of a Professional Nanny. Yes, I said nanny. It has been (and continues to be) my most IMPORTANT and most BELOVED out of all the interesting and rewarding positions I have held. 

The Inspiration

Since I have taken care of boys and girls, I have noticed a divide between how the latter are expected to learn (what, when & how), as opposed to that of the former. A lot of girls show an early interest in STEM, but are not encouraged to follow that path. And as we all know, certain encouragement comes from the toys with which one is allowed to play. Many of these girls are not exposed to technology-based toys idiosyncratic to their gender. 


It's a fact: most girls love DOLLS. And this is where ESTEAM-Girls come in. On account of being a gender-specific educational toy company, we will begin with DOLLS. The DOLLS will each have unique backgrounds with STEM-centered agenda and personas. The acronym ESTEAM is an extension on that of STEM, and each distinct persona is depicted in its spelling: Entrepreneur, Scientist, Technologist, Engineer, Architect, Mathematician. In addition to the DOLLS, the first offerings will include their STUDENT ID's and DOWNLOADABLE APP (for the ESTEAM.University platform), plus a personalized JOURNAL. 
(Check our website for additional details: http://www.esteam-girls.com/.
Your contributions will help bring to life the 1st THREE VINYL DOLLS of the series and their aforementioned ACCESSORIES. 




The Effect & Affect

Statistically speaking, and based upon the National Science Foundation's (NSF) 2012 & 2014 studies on the STEM-centered workforce, the following factors are prominent and precise:

American Indians/Natives, Black African Americans, and Hispanics/Latinas (non-White) make up a smaller share of the science and engineering workforce, with 10% of workers in science and engineering occupations and 13% of science and engineering degree holders in 2011, than their proportion in the general population, with 26% of U.S. population age 21 and older.
Asians work in science and engineering occupations at higher rates (19%) than their representation in the U.S. working-age population (5%). Asians are particularly highly concentrated in computer and information science occupations (22% Asian).*

Minority women comprise fewer than 1 in 10 employed scientists and engineers.
Within every S&E (science & engineering) occupation, more than half of all workers are non-Hispanic/Latina Whites. 

The importance of these statistics is not lost on the goal to manufacture the 1st THREE DOLLS, collectively, and expose their individual heritages to girls who may learn more about ethnic diversity, acknowledgement and acceptance. This, of course, in conjunction with absorbing and excelling at the STEM-based subjects. 

                                         
                                      1. ÉVARI Ana, The ENTREPRENEUR ...

              




                                      2. SHELBY Christine, The SCIENTIST ...







                                   3. TESSA Mei-Li, The TECHNOLOGIST ...
        * Although Asians, male and female, have a much stronger standing within this           particular workforce than Black African Americans & Hispanics/Latinas, we                feel it's important to include TESSA, so as not to exclude her based solely on              her positive positioning. And most importantly, even with the agreeable                        standing, there is still no mainstream Asian American doll on the market.                      We, at ESTEAM-Girls, want to be the first to fill in this gap.  



Rolling out the 1st THREE DOLLS at once will garner more selections from which to choose. The donor/contributor/customer and/or recipient/consumer may purchase one, two, or all three dolls, They won't have to wait long between acquiring their favorite(s).

After the 1st THREE DOLLS have a SUCCESSFUL run ;-), the 2nd SET will be manufactured more efficiently.










The Necessities
We need to raise $150,000 in order to produce the following:


A minimum of a 1,000 pieces for each doll must be met. Thus, a 3000-doll production run at $33/piece equals $99,000 in total for the dolls (to be made in Dongguan, China). 

Custom display boxes (also 3,000 pieces) will total $14,500 (to be made in California, USA).                                                   2D MOCK-UP

To build the ESTEAM.University infrastructure & APP, an approximate cost of $27,000 has been assessed, and this amount is extremely conservative (to be made in the USA or Western Europe). 
                            

The remaining $9,500 will be used for deliveries, and any unforeseen additional costs and expenses pertaining to manufacturing.
If the entire goal is not met, and depending on the amount that has been, the lower sum raised will be applied to producing at least ONE DOLL/PERSONA and her immediate ACCESSORIES (by popularity, your VOTE will determine which one that will be).



The Risks & Rewards

 We are not blind to the fact that we have COMPETITION great, small, and all sizes in between. And it's not mistaken that our rivals are not just other doll, toy and education companies (ex: American Girl by Mattel). Those contenders are any company - mainstream, specialty, or otherwise - vying for discretionary income. 


However, optional or compulsory, our unique offerings will include a SUBSCRIPTION BOX MEMBERSHIP option - games, plushies, books, challenges, lessons, apps, arts & crafts, and of course, more dolls. With high-quality products, current and easy-to-use technology, unrivaled value, excellent service and superior support, the ESTEAM-Girls team of talented people and advisers will be able to provide our customer base with sectorial tools for cognitive thinking, the platform for expression, and the constituent for creation. 

And directly due of your support, you'll help us build a powerful foundation that no competitor can easily undermine. 

The Vision & Mission
With your monetary contributions,  ESTEAM-Girls (& ESTEAM.University)  will be taken from embryonic conception to absolute completion. We desire to make it a girl's go-to platform for STEM-centered playtime, learning and socializing. And with your generous donations, this possibility will become an actuality. 


Together, we will ENCOURAGE, ENLIGHTEN & EMPOWER a new generation of GIRLS to become the principal STEM, I mean, ESTEAM leaders of tomorrow! :-)

<h3><b>The Cenotaph </b></h3>
<p>The Cenotaph will consist 
of 3 elements. At the centre will be a steel structure depicting a 
Flanders Field Poppy. This will be surrounded by the individually

blacksmiths from all over the world and shipped to Ypres, ensuring that it truly is an international commemoration. <br/></p>

<br/><h3>Project Background</h3>
<p>Blacksmiths and farriers played an important part in the war.  They, along with soldiers, miners, medics and civilians of all nations made great sacrifices both on the battle field and at home. It's against this background that blacksmiths and farriers worldwide are using their skill and craft to remember all those who suffered. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4029/4699967683_9f9dd52964_b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Blacksmiths were required to make and repair a variety of vital equipment for the war effort both on the battlefield and at home. Over 8 million horses and countless mules and donkeys were used in the war.There are many distressing images showing the conditions which soldiers and their horses endured on a daily basis. <br/></p>

<p>With the vast number of men being called to the Front, women stepped up to undertake what were previously considered to be male occupations, including blacksmithing. <br/></p>

<br/>Blacksmiths and Farriers from all 
over the world will gather in Ypres to create this unique Cenotaph. They will be coming from many countries including Belgium, USA, 
Germany, Wales, Canada, Ukraine, France, Scotland, England, Italy, Chile, South Africa, Russia, New 
Zealand, Australia and Japan.<br/><br/><p>Forging stations, tools, equipment and the infrastructure requirements 
of such an event will be set up in the beautiful Grote Markt (market square) Ypres
 to create the Cenotaph. The event will include blacksmithing and 
farrier demonstrations, a horse shoeing demonstration, a children's forging 
area, an exhibition of blacksmithing art and lectures.</p>

</p>Blacksmiths will be hammering hot metal throughout the week, making a
 spectacular sight and sound as teams of 6 smiths create the 25 
individually designed panels which will surround the main structure of the Cenotaph. <br/><br/>School children across Europe have been having a great time forging poppies and there will also be an opportunity for children to forge them at the event.  These poppies are smaller than those which will form the Cenotaph and they will be made into a wreath to be placed at the Menin Gate. <br/><br/>The major
international exhibition of contemporary forged metal design will consist of artistic interpretations the notion of ‘Transition’ and following the event, the exhibition will
tour various locations culminating at a major London venue as part of the
celebrations of the centenary of the Armistice in 2018. <br/><br/><h3>
<b>Patrons and Partners</b>
</h3>
<p>We are thrilled
to have Michael Morpurgo and Sebastian Faulks as Patrons of the project. Michael is author of the
novel War Horse which became a very successful theatre production and famous
Steven Spielberg film. Michael has also been a great help in providing the supporting video for the campaign. 
</p>
<p>Sebastian
Faulks is author of many novels including Birdsong,  which is set in Flanders in 1916 and is now described
 as a ‘modern classic’. The TV adaptation starred Oscar-winning actor, 
Eddie Redmayne.  On visiting the battlefields when researching Birdsong Sebastian said 
</p>
<p>""<em><i>That trip introduced me to men who had actually fought there. I met 
about six of them and talked to them about their experiences. It helped 
to bring the war out of an area marked ‘history’ and put it under the 
heading of life. Here we were in the actual field; and they were the 
same men. Over there, by that tree, was where his friend had died</i>.""</em> <br/></p>
<p>We've secured considerable in-kind support from a number of 
organisations who are sharing their knowledge, equipment and materials 
to support the project. This includes the Flanders’ Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry and the Ypres and Langemark-Poelkapelle town councils.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>How You Can Help  </h2>
<h3></h3>
<p><br/>Over £100,000
has already been raised to fund the project through donations and in-kind
support from individuals and organisations. A further £80,000 is required to
enable us to create this unique commemoration.</p>
<p>Your contribution, be it large or small, will make a big difference 
in helping us fund the Cenotaph and remembering those who gave their 
lives or made sacrifices from which many never recovered. 
</p>
<p>You may simply wish to make a donation towards the project, you may 
like to sponsor items which will form part of the Cenotaph, or you may 
like to receive an item or experience in return for your contribution. 
There are some fantastic items available which we've listed below.
</p>
<p>The money raised will be used to fund the 6 day event where 2 of the 3
 elements of the Cenotaph will be created. This will include materials, infrastructure and logistics. Due to its size and the 
finish required, the 7m tall central structure is being created in 
advance and will be erected temporarily in the Grote Markt during the 
event for all to see, before being transported to its final location. 
</p>
<p>In the event that we do not reach our required funding goal we will 
reconsider the size of the event although we sincerely hope that this will not 
impact on the Cenotaph itself. <br/></p>
<h3>
<br/>What Perks are Available</h3>
<p>There are a range of perks available through the campaign, from 
affordable items which we hope will appeal to all, to top-end items for 
which we're requesting larger donations. 
</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>And now... after 5 years of working in various places around Porto, the opportunity to create my own personal space has come and I decided to take it! </p>
<p>So, I gave up the security of my current job and followed both my heart and the challenge of friends and customers who are somehow moved by my work and always encouraged me to follow my own path. <br/>I decided to take this gamble knowing that that encouragement translates into support: having no personal funds to draw upon, I managed to secure the rental of a commercial space thanks to loans from friends and family members who volunteered to help when they heard of the project.<br/>
<br/>Things are moving fast and <strong>Árvore do Mundo </strong>(portuguese for<strong> ""World Tree""</strong>  - the element connecting the Underground, Terrestrial and Celestial worlds in mythology) is due to open in <strong>May </strong>(if everything goes as planned!).</p>
<p> So far I have raised about half the amount necessary for repair works, six months' advance rent, gear, furniture, legal expenses (insurance, permits, etc), stocks of food and drinks... so I'm asking for your help with the other half!<br/><br/><br/><strong>What is needed?</strong>
</p>
</div><p></p><div>
So, for all the items listed above (and for unexpected expenses!), I need about <strong>20,000€</strong>, of which I have raised around <strong>9500€</strong> so far thanks to loans from friends and family, so about<strong> 10,000€</strong> are still needed to fulfill this dream!<br/>*Note: the goal set for this campaign is 10,000€, but approximately 10% of that amount will be spent on processing fees, so in fact the project will get 9000€. <br/>So, feel free to continue contributing after the 10,000€ goal has been met :) </div><p>I have considered a bank loan, but besides the huge amount of paperwork and gigantic interest rates, banks tend not to lend money unless you have it already, which is not the case :) ... and the time a bank would take to decide on a loan is time I can't afford to wait.<br/><br/>In fact, timing has been of the essence for this project: there were lots of people interested in renting the space, so I had to seal the deal very fast, believing that everything would fall into place afterwards... with help from all of you :) </p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>And what do I get in return for helping?</strong> </p><p>Since <strong>World Tree</strong> is located in Porto, Portugal and you might be somewhere else, there is no tangible reward I can offer you, besides the gratifying knowledge that you're supporting a project that is beneficial not just for you and me, but for the World. </p><p>That's why I say ""<em>tangible</em> reward"", because intangible rewards and gratitude will always be present, since I believe that vegetarianism is a valuable and positive attitude we can take on behalf of the planet, by reducing the use of animal products.</p><p>But... if you are in Porto or you're planning to be, <strong>World Tree</strong> will be delighted to welcome you with a smile and a hug, and to nourish your body and soul with food straight from the Earth and the Heart :)<br/>And if you wish to, you will be able to exchange your contribution to this fundraiser (<strong>10€</strong> <strong>minimum</strong>) for a daily lunch menu!<br/>Any contributions below 10€ will also be greatly and thankfully appreciated, of course :)</p><p><br/></p><p><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What's the concept behind World Tree?</strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><br/></p><p>For the past 2 or 3 years, Porto has been developing as a place to be enjoyed both by locals and visitors, with a huge number of new food establishments opening every month; but there is still no place in the area like the one I envision... </p><p></p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459895937/bow2vb80cu00uk0z3xc7_gfinen.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 400px;""/><p><br/></p><p></p><p>Most vegetarian places here are classic restaurants, and I aim to create a space that combines snacks, books, exhibitions, music and poetry performances, workshops, theme dinners, and a store...

</div></div>","--- Texto em português mais abaixo/portuguese text below --- Helping the World Tree to grow! Hi all, I am Joana and I've been a vegetarian cook for the past 5 years (besides previous occupations as a theater actress and Reiki therapist). I am passionate about these three fields, and they have contributed to make me the person I am today. Even though I'm currently working mostly as a cook, I am strongly connected to them and they are present in my work and my relationship to people and food.I became a vegetarian 8 years ago, when my son was born - and he's been raised by the same principles.  The promotion of vegetarianism as a healthy and valid option, is a mission both on the personal and professional level. 


 

And now... after 5 years of working in various places around Porto, the opportunity to create my own personal space has come and I decided to take it! 
So, I gave up the security of my current job and followed both my heart and the challenge of friends and customers who are somehow moved by my work and always encouraged me to follow my own path. I decided to take this gamble knowing that that encouragement translates into support: having no personal funds to draw upon, I managed to secure the rental of a commercial space thanks to loans from friends and family members who volunteered to help when they heard of the project.
Things are moving fast and Árvore do Mundo (portuguese for ""World Tree""  - the element connecting the Underground, Terrestrial and Celestial worlds in mythology) is due to open in May (if everything goes as planned!).
 So far I have raised about half the amount necessary for repair works, six months' advance rent, gear, furniture, legal expenses (insurance, permits, etc), stocks of food and drinks... so I'm asking for your help with the other half!What is needed?


So, for all the items listed above (and for unexpected expenses!), I need about 20,000€, of which I have raised around 9500€ so far thanks to loans from friends and family, so about 10,000€ are still needed to fulfill this dream!*Note: the goal set for this campaign is 10,000€, but approximately 10% of that amount will be spent on processing fees, so in fact the project will get 9000€. So, feel free to continue contributing after the 10,000€ goal has been met :) I have considered a bank loan, but besides the huge amount of paperwork and gigantic interest rates, banks tend not to lend money unless you have it already, which is not the case :) ... and the time a bank would take to decide on a loan is time I can't afford to wait.In fact, timing has been of the essence for this project: there were lots of people interested in renting the space, so I had to seal the deal very fast, believing that everything would fall into place afterwards... with help from all of you :) And what do I get in return for helping? Since World Tree is located in Porto, Portugal and you might be somewhere else, there is no tangible reward I can offer you, besides the gratifying knowledge that you're supporting a project that is beneficial not just for you and me, but for the World. That's why I say ""tangible reward"", because intangible rewards and gratitude will always be present, since I believe that vegetarianism is a valuable and positive attitude we can take on behalf of the planet, by reducing the use of animal products.But... if you are in Porto or you're planning to be, World Tree will be delighted to welcome you with a smile and a hug, and to nourish your body and soul with food straight from the Earth and the Heart :)And if you wish to, you will be able to exchange your contribution to this fundraiser (10€ minimum) for a daily lunch menu!Any contributions below 10€ will also be greatly and thankfully appreciated, of course :)What's the concept behind World Tree? For the past 2 or 3 years, Porto has been developing as a place to be enjoyed both by locals and visitors, with a huge number of new food establishments opening every month; but there is still no place in the area like the one I envision... Most vegetarian places here are classic restaurants, and I aim to create a space that combines snacks, books, exhibitions, music and poetry performances, workshops, theme dinners, and a store... A space that reflects my personal approach to life, integrating the worlds of art, nutrition and nature and working also with a network of collaborators, like a true World Tree, growing stronger roots every day and becoming a home where you can eat and drink, but also just be in the way you prefer: reading, talking, singing, hugging, breathing...World Tree also aims at working with and for the community, helping to unravel some of the preconceptions about being a vegetarian; I'm looking forward to sharing my experience and knowledge in a place devoted to everyone (vegetarian or not!), where you can share information, stories, ideas and other things, and not only food.Will this tree grow fast and strong?So far, the people who know about the project have been very excited about the prospect of this kind of space opening in this part of town, so with a lot of hard work and a little help from all of you, World Tree will do its best to make a lot of people happy!But of course, this kind of adventure has its risks :) Maybe I'm aware of only some of them so far, but as the project develops new obstacles will probably arise... that's why the amount this campaign aims to raise is directed at legal and bureaucratic issues, such as advance rent payments and insurance, and also unforeseen expenses, so that a safe ground can be established for this tree to grow on :)Can I help without contributing with money?Of course :) Any kind of help is welcome, like spreading this campaign among your contacts, or just by believing in this project and encouraging it!Your energy makes all the difference!This project has made me learn a lot about how far people will go to help you fulfill your dreams... there are no words to describe the feelings I've had since this journey began, and the gratitude towards everybody that has helped this tree grow collectively, as it should :) The World Tree connects and supports all levels of existence, so this is not just about me and my dream, but also about each one of us and the way we give ourselves!Also, if you want to contribute and you don't have a PayPal account, or if you prefer, please send your donation to my bank account (IBAN: PT50 0035 0160 0006 1269 30073) and let me know by email (luzdaindia@gmail.com) or Facebook (www.facebook.com/joana.esteves.5688). Thank you!This campaign will be kept fresh with video updates, photos of the work's progress, news and more, so stay tuned!I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU ALL!

 Ajudando a Árvore do Mundo a crescer!Queridos amigos, o meu nome é Joana e sou cozinheira vegetariana desde há 5 anos (anteriormente trabalhei também como actriz de teatro e terapeuta de Reiki).Estas três áreas são aquelas em que me movo, que me apaixonam e que juntas contribuiram para fazer de mim a pessoa que sou hoje. Embora actualmente trabalhe mais como cozinheira, mantenho forte ligação com cada uma delas e estão presentes também no meu trabalho e na minha ligação com as pessoas e a comida. Tornei-me vegetariana há 8 anos, quando o meu filho nasceu, estando portanto ele a crescer segundo os mesmos princípios.A promoção do vegetarianismo como uma opção saudável e válida, é uma questão  importante para mim, e uma missão tanto a nível pessoal como profissional. 
E agora... após 5 anos de trabalho em vários estabelecimentos na zona do Porto, surgiu a oportunidade de criar o meu próprio espaço, e decidi agarrá-la!
Abdiquei da segurança do meu emprego para seguir o meu coração, bem como o desafio de amigos e clientes que, de alguma forma, se sentem tocados pelo meu trabalho e sempre me encorajaram a seguir o meu próprio caminho.Decidi também correr este risco sabendo que esse encorajamento se traduz em apoio: embora não tenha capital próprio, consegui assegurar o aluguer de um estabelecimento  na zona central do Porto (junto à Praça da Batalha e ao Jardim de São Lázaro) graças a empréstimos de amigos e familiares que, quando souberam deste projecto, se ofereceram para ajudar.
Tudo está a evoluir rapidamente e a Árvore do Mundo (o nome do símbolo mitológico que une o Mundo Subterrâneo, Terrestre e Celestial, e também o nome deste novo espaço!) irá abrir portas em Maio (a correr tudo como espero).
Até ao momento consegui reunir cerca de metade do capital necessário para seis meses de renda adiantados, obras, equipamento, mobiliário, despesas legais (seguros, licenças, etc), recheio de comida e bebida... e por isso venho pedir a vossa colaboração para reunir a restante metade!
 

Como posso ajudar?

Para corresponder às despesas que referi (e para outras despesas imprevistas!), são necessários cerca de 20 000€, dos quais já foram reunidos 9500€, por empréstimo junto de amigos e familiares, ficando a faltar cerca de 10 000€.
*Nota: o valor estabelecido para esta angariação é de 10 000€, mas cerca de 10% do total das contribuições será deduzido pela plataforma, em custos associados à própria campanha; por isso, mesmo que o objectivo de 10 000€ venha a ser atingido, as contribuições feitas para lá desse ponto também serão extremamente bem-vindas :) 

Ponderei a possibilidade de recorrer a um empréstimo bancário, mas para além da enorme quantidade de burocracia e das altas taxas de juros associadas, os bancos tendem a não emprestar dinheiro a não ser que já tenhamos algum, o que não é o caso :) e o tempo que um empréstimo demora a ser aprovado é tempo de que eu não posso dispor!
 Na verdade, o tempo tem sido essencial para este processo: havia muitos outros interessados em alugar o estabelecimento, por isso tive de fechar o negócio muito rapidamente, confiando que em seguida todas as peças virão a encaixar... com a ajuda de todos vós :)

 
O que recebo em troca da minha contribuição?

In April of 2010, Laurie was able to move the gallery into a unique brick &amp; mortar space in Capitol Hill. Tucked in a mossy courtyard at the crossover between E Denny Way &amp; Olive Way, this hybrid gallery + boutique has steadily grown and refined its offerings of rotating visual art, handmade jewelry by local designers, gift items and prints. This campaign was created because Ghost Gallery wants to stay relevant within our ever-changing neighborhood, as well as cater to the growing online art collecting and shopping community. And so:</span> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ghost Gallery is ready for an expanded, more comprehensive website that will:<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A. Continue to offer a stellar collection of rotating Visual Art &amp; Handmade goods, with worldwide shipping options.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">B. Take things to the next level online by adding more artist-focused content and easier access to handmade goods that help support the small business economy.<br/></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">C. Provide more online exhibiting opportunities for underrepresented artists; feature submission-based new media projects like video art; include artist-to-viewer discussion and Q&amp;A's.</span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">:<br/></span>
</h3> <ul> <li>In order to focus our energy and resources on expanding the gallery's online presence (while streamlining our brick &amp; mortar space and keeping the bills paid), financial support is a must. Pre-and-Post launch needs include hiring a web designer to upgrade &amp; redesign the site, implementing a long term digital + brand marketing strategy, purchasing inventory, creating online content, upgrading the currently tiny gallery storage space and compensating staff.</li> <li>There will be much love in return, including Ghost Gallery Memberships, Handmade Jewelry, Original Art, Personal In-House Curatorial services &amp; much more...</li> <li>Funds received would go to all of the above mentioned. Your support would help get us there much more quickly and efficiently. If our stretch goal of $20k is reached, we can very likely get launched by Fall 2016. If our initial goal is not met we will still move forward with our online expansion as funds allow.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>""I of course value the rewarding, face-to-face experience of connecting people with artwork and or handmade goods that they love and appreciate. Which is why the physical gallery space is remaining intact. As someone who has lived and worked in Capitol Hill for the past eleven years, I’ve experienced first-hand the many small business challenges within the neighborhood, including the shift in how people are shopping for original art and handmade items. So while maintaining our brick &amp; mortar gallery is essential for providing hands-on opportunities for new and emerging artists, we also need to grow beyond the courtyard in order to thrive. With your support, creating a larger online presence would allow us to do this, by reaching out to a global audience, and continuing to nurture our community relationships here at home."" ~ LK.</p>

Tucked in a mossy courtyard at the crossover between E Denny Way & Olive Way, this hybrid gallery + boutique has steadily grown and refined its offerings of rotating visual art, handmade jewelry by local designers, gift items and prints. This campaign was created because Ghost Gallery wants to stay relevant within our ever-changing neighborhood, as well as cater to the growing online art collecting and shopping community. And so: 
Ghost Gallery is ready for an expanded, more comprehensive website that will:A. Continue to offer a stellar collection of rotating Visual Art & Handmade goods, with worldwide shipping options.B. Take things to the next level online by adding more artist-focused content and easier access to handmade goods that help support the small business economy.C. Provide more online exhibiting opportunities for underrepresented artists; feature submission-based new media projects like video art; include artist-to-viewer discussion and Q&A's.   What We Need:
  In order to focus our energy and resources on expanding the gallery's online presence (while streamlining our brick & mortar space and keeping the bills paid), financial support is a must. Pre-and-Post launch needs include hiring a web designer to upgrade & redesign the site, implementing a long term digital + brand marketing strategy, purchasing inventory, creating online content, upgrading the currently tiny gallery storage space and compensating staff. There will be much love in return, including Ghost Gallery Memberships, Handmade Jewelry, Original Art, Personal In-House Curatorial services & much more... Funds received would go to all of the above mentioned. Your support would help get us there much more quickly and efficiently. If our stretch goal of $20k is reached, we can very likely get launched by Fall 2016. If our initial goal is not met we will still move forward with our online expansion as funds allow.    The Impact ""I of course value the rewarding, face-to-face experience of connecting people with artwork and or handmade goods that they love and appreciate. Which is why the physical gallery space is remaining intact. As someone who has lived and worked in Capitol Hill for the past eleven years, I’ve experienced first-hand the many small business challenges within the neighborhood, including the shift in how people are shopping for original art and handmade items. So while maintaining our brick & mortar gallery is essential for providing hands-on opportunities for new and emerging artists, we also need to grow beyond the courtyard in order to thrive. With your support, creating a larger online presence would allow us to do this, by reaching out to a global audience, and continuing to nurture our community relationships here at home."" ~ LK.

<br/>Savor Fine Foods came to life just over 5 years ago from the creative mind of Andre Kreft. He worked as a visual artist in the San Francisco Bay Area for 25 years, but returned to Connecticut to be closer to family, which included getting married. Andre and his husband bought a large house in Waterbury in order to spend more time with Andre's mother. But as we know, even the best laid plans can take a different turn, and fourteen months later both Andre's mother and husband had passed away. <br/><br/>At the time, Andre had began experimenting with baking. Not sure which direction this newfound passion would take him,  developing Savor gave him a way to move on. Andre used his skills as a visual artist to allow his sense of taste to heighten. He often mentions how he began to be able to “see” how different flavors rose on the tongue.  <br/><br/>From humble beginnings of baking in a friend's rented restaurant kitchen after hours, to now baking over 50,000 cookies a week, none of us could have imagined the growth and scope of Savor Cookies. We have outgrown our warehouse space in Watertown as well as our shared kitchen in New Preston, CT.

She was approached by a person at her own place of residence at gunpoint demanding her money. When my mother explained she didn't have any money to give him, he pointed the weapon at my mother and pulled the trigger. Fortunately the gunman's weapon malfunctioned, the bullets fell to the ground and the punk simply ran off. As you can imagine she was extremely terrified. Can you imagine this happening to your mother? I can tell you it's not a welcoming feeling! Instead of getting angry I started working towards some goals. It's been nearly 4 years now but the feeling still hurts my heart to the core. I vowed I'd take a stand against crimes of this nature as soon as I was in position to do so. I'm now the new owner operator of my own </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Private Protection Agency. </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I strongly believe I have what it takes to make a difference in my community. I'm sure we all have elderly people that we love and cherish. I'm talking about our family members, our friends and our acquaintances, we want the best for them especially in regards to their safety. They play a big part of each and everyone of our lives. Let's be honest people, when someone we care about is victimized we all feel victimized. Crime doesn't come with a manual and it definitely doesn't discriminate. I wasn't able to be there for my mother that terrifying day, but I want to make sure I'm there for someone else's loved one. No one should have to live in fear or be taken advantage of because they're considered weak. My questions to a potential contributor is ""<i>What if this was your mother or someone you loved?""</i> or better yet<i>""What would you do to help prevent this from happening to your loved one?""</i> <br/><br/>I ask these questions because it really never really seems to hit home until it affects you directly. This is not just the victims problem, its all of our problem. We need to get a plan in place to show our seniors we understand the frustration and were here to give our support. No one knows what tomorrow will bring. If 1.8 million seniors are victimized each year, how long will it be before this problem reaches someone you love? Now that's the true question. It hit home for me in a huge unexpected way already, that's why I'm so passionate about this campaign.  </span><p></p>

  need to come together and support our seniors. They are not a burden 
but an asset. As soon as we recognize that WE are the author of change 
in our communities we can start healing each community one at a time "" 


Please meet my mother, Betty Smith and hear her story. 

In 2013 my mother Betty Smith was a victim of violent crime. She was approached by a person at her own place of residence at gunpoint demanding her money. When my mother explained she didn't have any money to give him, he pointed the weapon at my mother and pulled the trigger. Fortunately the gunman's weapon malfunctioned, the bullets fell to the ground and the punk simply ran off. As you can imagine she was extremely terrified. Can you imagine this happening to your mother? I can tell you it's not a welcoming feeling! Instead of getting angry I started working towards some goals. It's been nearly 4 years now but the feeling still hurts my heart to the core. I vowed I'd take a stand against crimes of this nature as soon as I was in position to do so. I'm now the new owner operator of my own Private Protection Agency. I strongly believe I have what it takes to make a difference in my community. I'm sure we all have elderly people that we love and cherish. I'm talking about our family members, our friends and our acquaintances, we want the best for them especially in regards to their safety. They play a big part of each and everyone of our lives. Let's be honest people, when someone we care about is victimized we all feel victimized. Crime doesn't come with a manual and it definitely doesn't discriminate. I wasn't able to be there for my mother that terrifying day, but I want to make sure I'm there for someone else's loved one. No one should have to live in fear or be taken advantage of because they're considered weak. My questions to a potential contributor is ""What if this was your mother or someone you loved?"" or better yet""What would you do to help prevent this from happening to your loved one?"" I ask these questions because it really never really seems to hit home until it affects you directly. This is not just the victims problem, its all of our problem. We need to get a plan in place to show our seniors we understand the frustration and were here to give our support. No one knows what tomorrow will bring. If 1.8 million seniors are victimized each year, how long will it be before this problem reaches someone you love? Now that's the true question. It hit home for me in a huge unexpected way already, that's why I'm so passionate about this campaign.  
Talking about it won't change a thing, but strapping up your boots and hitting the ground running will, I'm a strong believer in action speaking louder than words and honestly, I think we've talked about it long enough!  My primary target for this campaign is addressing the issues of property and violent crimes against the elderly community.


Your donations will not only help us provide private patrol services in the community, it also helps us send a message to our local senior citizens saying ""we recognize the problem and we care"". 


I've completed the steps to 
acquire the necessary license and city permits to operate in the state 
of California, City of Bakersfield. I also exhausted all my funds in 
doing so. That's why your support will be greatly appreciated. I believe
 if we all look into our hearts and support this campaign the sky is the
 limit. Contributions :
  If we reach our goal of $50,000 here's the breakdown of what the funds will be used for:

$18,000 = 4 Patrol vehicles $4,500 Ea.
$15,000 = Build a team 
$5,000  = Radio Communications
$4,000 = Required Armed guard Insurance
$3,000 = Fuel expense 
$2,500 = Uniforms and equipment (Belts, badges, utility belts, batons, mace, handcuffs, etc.) 
$2,500 = Safety, prevention, awareness and self defense classes will be offered to local residence. The instructor is a retired LAPD officer of 25 years, who will conduct continuous education and support.





My goal is to expand throughout 
Kern County and surrounding areas. Please join
 us and be apart of something special. If you can't donate money 
that's okay! There are plenty of things you can still do to help, like 
sharing this campaign using Indiegogo's share tools to inform friends 
and family to increase notoriety. You can even get motivated and 
start campaigning  in your own community and help out. I want this to 
spread like wildfire. This is a much needed service and an asset 
to the people of Bakersfield. We're dedicated to improving the quality 
of life for senior citizens one community at time.



Statistical reality: 

According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)



1,796,740 senior citizens are victimized every year

84% of the crimes against seniors go unreported

59% of elderly violent crimes are reported near or at their own homes. According to the Department Of Justice (D.O.J)

The US Government estimates 5 million seniors are victims every year
Property crimes against seniors are an estimated 13-1.
The vast majority of crimes against senior citizens total 93% in the areas of robbery, auto theft, burglary and property damage. 7% are victims of violent crime.

and now we have a new common big dream and goal – to build a culture center to
provide MOTUS VITA members wider possibilities for personality development: to

They are not able either to develop or to apply their skills, to make their
dreams come true, though every one of them deep inside wishes desperately to
live a full life. There are over 20 000 of such persons in the city of Riga,
and in real world it is very difficult for them to find a place where they
could feel right and useful member of this society.</p>

<p>Every

want to help those who are in difficulties, thus increasing their professional

to avoid overwork.</p>
<p>How
it comes, I thought, why it is not possible to do anything? That couldn’t be true!
And I started collecting information about the disease, treatment and
rehabilitation possibilities. People who faced the same problem in one way or
another started to enter into my life: medical staff, patients and their families,
goodhearted people who help persons like me. Thus, we decided to take problem
solution into our own hands and founded in 2009 a non-governmental organization
MOTUS VITA.</p>
<p>We
understand our problems more than anyone else. We really want to solve them, to

<p><b>The Swag Is In The Building!<br/></b>Beer Swag Monthly is excited to announce the official launch of our monthly subscription box service. We are a fun and very affordable monthly box! We partner directly with craft breweries across the country to bring you truly unique beer swag each month. Your box will always consist of a craft brewery tshirt, a write-up about the featured brewery and 2-3 craft beer items such as koozies from craft breweries, stickers from craft breweries, beer soaps, bottle openers and more. We will never send generic merchandise, it will always come from craft breweries and craft beer companies!</p>
<p><b>Father and Son Combining Interests!</b><br/>We are a team led by Father and Son, whose combined interests led to the creation of Beer Swag Monthly. One is an avid craft beer fan, trader and festival goer and the other is one who truly loves e-commerce and particularly the subscription business model. Together, we believe we have created a service we are not only passionate about, but that our subscribers will truly love.</p>
<p><b>Striving For Profit and For Purpose</b><br/>As said in our video, we are not only striving for profit, but also purpose. My father has served in the military for over 30 years, so we value the service our military members have provided us. To show our respect and support we have decided to donate to the Wounded Warrior Project. We also believe in helping the youth of America, so we've decided to support The Kids in Need Foundation. <br/></p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We understand there are various risks and challenges related to each business category. We have done extensive research and planning to limit the risks we encounter. We are fortunate enough to own our very own screen printing company, which will limit our risks in the tshirt area. Also, we have created numerous relationships with various suppliers to limit the risk of any accessories setbacks. We see our main risk as being able to sustain an adequate number of subscribers to keep Beer Swag Monthly running. With your help, Indiegogo, we can jump start this growth process, mass market our service, and devote ourselves to keeping our subscribers satisfied with our wide variety of craft beer products. Cheers!</p>

Jobs were hard to obtain with such a high unemployment rate, at the time. So, I strapped on my boots and walked and talked The Cheesecake Store to anyone that would listen. With help from my friends I kept going. On my own, I built a website to sell my products.  In order for me to sell to the public, I used a community commercial-rental kitchen.  I transformed my family vehicle into the the Cheesecake mobile, which then became a certified mobile vendor vehicle! The rental kitchen I used was far away from home, so I really needed a closer shop so everyone in Chicago can stop and have a cheesecake jar ,an awesomely fresh meal and a place to sit and chat. This place is now my home in Plainfield Illinois, but there's so many people that want a Cheesecake Store and Sandwich Shop in their neighborhood.

<h3>
<strong>Mead</strong> (n): <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">a fermented beverage made of honey, water, yeast and sometimes fruit.  Nectar of the Gods. Floki’s fave.</span>
</h3>
<p>While there are many great microbreweries and wine bars across the country, there are few that serve mead. Here in Santa Fe, a.k.a. “The City Different,” we’re living up to our city’s reputation by creating a taproom and gastropub that serves locally sourced mead, local micro-brewed beers and ciders. The local Falcon Meadery, which we are in the process of purchasing, will be the primary source of the mead we serve and, honoring mead’s history as the first fermented beverage made by man, we are creating The Root Cellar taproom to make you feel as though you've traveled back in time to drink your mead with the vikings... or Tyrion Lannister.</p>
<p>When you visit The Root Cellar we know you're going to want some delicious, expertly prepared food to accompany your mead, beer, or cider. The Root Cellar taproom will serve a new high-end gastropub menu created by Chef Greg Menke. </p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Chef Greg Menke owns <a href=""http://www.thebeestro.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Beestro</a> (open for four years now, a popular lunch spot with both locals and visitors) and <a href=""http://thehivemarket.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Hive Market</a> in downtown Santa Fe.  Greg loves anything that has to do with honeybees and has successfully started and sold honey bee-centric businesses in both Santa Fe and Hawaii. He also holds a degree in culinary arts and his skills will be prominently on display in the new gastropub.</p>
<p>The Hive Market, which has been open for almost a year, sells artisan and craft items as well as unique local foods from New Mexico. We are committed to sustainability and selling goods that are made here. We believe it’s important to support other local businesses and most of the honey we sell is from northern New Mexico.</p>
<p>We’ve already raised a majority of the money required for the commercial kitchen, but we need a bit more to complete the build-out for that and for The Root Cellar. Our goal is to open by November 1, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>What Will We Do With the Money You Give?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy equipment for the commercial kitchen:  walk-in freezer, refrigerator, convection oven, range:  $30,000</li>
<li>Build a refrigerated chill room for the mead: $11,000</li>
<li>Renovate the restrooms: $5,200</li>
<li>Furnish the bar – tables, chairs, bar equipment: $11,300</li>
<li>Plates, glasses, silverware, POS system, server station: $7,800</li>
<li>New lighting: $2,100</li>
<li>New floor: $8,000</li>
<li>Buy tables and chairs:  $8,000</li>
<li>Signage: $1,900</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We have many more perks than most campaigns. Here’s why: unfortunately we cannot ship mead everywhere in the United States yet, and some of you may prefer your honey straight up rather than in a beverage! For these reasons, in addition to our mead we are offering our local honey as a perk along with other honey related items that make for an attractive gift basket for the upcoming holidays.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We are also bundling a custom drinking horn and holder with several of our perks. These are custom made so the one you get may look slightly different than the one shown here.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>For those who wish to sample Chef Greg’s gastronomic skills, we are offering custom dinners in the Root Cellar.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to make mead, our head meadmaker at Falcon Meadery, David, will personally show you how it’s done.</p>
<p>If you are a mead hobbyist and think you have a killer recipe, submit it and David will recreate it. The Hive Market team will sample and select the two best recipes and those drinks will be named after their creators and served in the Root Cellar.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Risks</strong></p>
<p>The opening of the taproom is contingent on us getting a liquor license. The location was previously home to two bars so we are confident we will receive the license. We have already applied and should have a firm answer in mid-September.</p>

Let's face it, there are very few people that haven't craved a Greggs sausage roll but lacked the Sunday morning motivation to walk to the nearest bakery, or how about those times you wish you could have a McDonalds at 2am but don't have a car - or perhaps you've ran out of loo roll, juice or cigarettes and can't get to the local shop.That's where MyLocalShop.co.uk comes in, a brand new service that enables anyone to order what they need online, pay in one simple step and have it delivered within 90 minutes of ordering by a friendly, chirpy delivery expert.  We pick up orders from multiple shops and combine them in one delivery. Operating 24/7 to bring customers what they want, when they want it. Whether it's groceries, beverages, fast food or party supplies, we'll deliver it.
We need your help to enable us to launch on a running start with comprehensive advertising campaigns, delivery networks and retailer partnerships.  The big supermarkets may offer home delivery - but they certainly don't offer same day delivery for those much needed items - we aim to help people to shop local from their own home, supporting local retailers, customers and delivery jobs.

   What We Need & What You Get To enable us to hit the ground running and offer a truly great service, we need your help in raising vital marketing and working capital funds, spreading the word and attracting Joe and Josephine Public to our service. Here's how it breaks down:  £2,000 working capital (This is the funds our drivers will use to initially purchase items for customers on specially formed company prepaid purchasing cards.)
£1,500 on legal, production and creative fees. £1,950 on Phonebox advertising, including production & VAT. £8,900 on Bus Shelter advertising, including production & VAT.
£6,500 on Prime Billboard advertising, including production & VAT.
£2,500 on Leaflet production & distribution to households & VAT.

£2,500 on Digital advertising (Google Adwords, Gumtree etc)
£1,000 on Driver Recruitment and background vetting.

<p>Hello and welcome to the Burl MFG campaign, we are Dailon and Liam Checkler. We are brothers born and raised in Columbus, Ohio and we have formed a small design and fabrication company focused on home goods and furniture. Through this campaign, we are raising money to help grow our company. With the nature of our work, we have an endless list of machinery that we hope to purchase to further our ability, from a fabrication standpoint. Your contribution will help us reach that goal, and allow us to purchase each resource we need to expand our ability and our company.</p>
<p>Our goal is to reach $10,000, which will aid in the purchasing of machinery. We are small, but we are diverse in our ability and can work with a wide range of material- from wood, to concrete, to metal. Because of the diversity in our ability, we are able to create a range of products, but this diversity also requires a range of machinery. Regardless of how much you can give, or whether we reach our goal, all of the money we raise will go toward this goal, and provide us with the resources necessary for success. </p>
<p>Our priority is to bring Columbus, Ohio products designed and fabricated with local material that is responsibly sourced. We want to bring a special experience to each customer purchasing our products. We love working with our customers to create custom products. Recently, we worked with the Webber family on a massive table, with the strength to endure the wear and tear of children, and can be the home to huge gatherings for holidays in the years to come. </p>
<p>With your support we can bring these experiences back to Columbus, and back to America. If you can't donate that doesn't mean you can't help. We ask that you spread the word about this campaign, and our company Burl MFG.</p>

<h3>About Us and Our Philosophy</h3>
<p>The Gypsy Rose Boutique is a mother-daughter small business committed to protecting the environment as we educate through art and connect with our community through nature by our sales of handmade natural products and art, such as jewelry, photography and more.</p>
<p>Our Mother, Carol, was born with a gypsy soul. In her past life, she traveled the country with other like-minded people by helping with their adventures and turned to making her own wares on the side. She eventually tamed her traveling spirit to settle down and start her family. She continued her sales career full time for the next 30 years and earned a Master's Degree of Education in Curriculum and Instruction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476287233/hkldcjavnjlstm0xwymb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our daughter, Kristen, was born with the same kind of spirit and was always ""on the go,"" as her mother and even grandmother were before her. Kristen gained inspiration from her elders to create her own wares and began selling them to friends throughout her time in school as a child. As she began her sales career at 16, she started learning more about business and her retail sales career progressed over the next 14 years. During her college years, Kristen began focusing more on business and learning about the environment and nature through Natural Science study.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476288182/oz9sqk7gyqjogvqbifqn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As our Mother was nearing retirement and our daughter suffered a tragedy that stopped her retail career suddenly in 2013, an idea was born. They went back to their traveling, ware making roots. Though successfully selling their products online and in the community individually, they realized they were replicating their efforts and needed more efficiency. </p>
<p>In May 2016, they combined their ideas and efforts to create The Gypsy Rose Boutique. Currently, The Gypsy Rose Boutique has reached out to the community more than ever through pop-up markets, online markets and social media to sell their natural products and to educate others about the importance and beauty of our environment. The Gypsy Rose Boutique was welcomed with open arms and invited to sell their natural products at local artist markets and the Galveston Art League for display of their nature, topography and other landscape photography. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476286220/gttc82rdvlcg94lmyu8d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Gypsy Rose Boutique has grown substantially over the last few months online. Website and marketplace traffic and sales have increased, social media following and engagement continues to grow, and the community is not only becoming more aware of the boutique, but also what we stand for.</p>
<p>The Gypsy Rose Boutique is about promoting the conserving and admiring of nature through our natural handmade jewelry and other products. We believe in supporting other small businesses by ensuring we are purchasing natural materials from them that are made or sold in the USA. We carefully review the regions where our materials are mined or imported and do our best to choose local suppliers that are as conscientious about their products as we are about ours.</p>
<p>The Gypsy Rose Boutique's philosophy is to be as environmentally-friendly as possible and to minimize our carbon footprint. We not only hand make our products and use natural materials, we also find vintage items to resell or repurpose. We keep our operations as efficient as possible. We are nearly paperless and completely mobile. We ensure are trucks are in good repair to minimize mobile emissions, only use as much electricity as necessary for our mobile community sales to do our part to help reduce point source emissions and follow the nature-respecting philosophy of ""leave no trace.""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476286300/hnkwolzlu2qnvyysgxgy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to continue our philosophy and take The Gypsy Rose Boutique to the next level, but we will need some help from you.</p>
<ul><li>We are requesting assistance with covering the purchase a cargo trailer and its set up as a truly mobile boutique. </li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475984394/shspuoysqxda9cklsdr6.png"" src="""" style=""""/>​</p>
<p>We believe this addition of the cargo trailer will help us reach out to more people in our community, further educate about the importance of preserving our environment and improve our efficiency by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing us to display more items that need protection from the Gulf Coast weather.</li>
<li>Including more educational type items with the additional protected space.</li>
<li>Easing the strenuous physical setup and take down efforts required for a mobile pop-up boutique.</li>
<li>Further reducing our impact on the environment by reducing the need for multiple vehicle trips to load and unload equipment and products for pop-up market shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Gypsy Rose Boutique will be able to focus more on our community with this addition of a cargo trailer. Your contributions will not only help us achieve our business goals, but will help make our community more nature savvy and environmentally aware by helping us demonstrate that environmentally-friendly business is possible and natural handmade products are also budget-friendly for consumers.</p>

<h3>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p>We're grateful to have the opportunity to reach out to the crowdfunding community and connect with backers. It's an amazing and exciting experience for us!</p>
<p>We realize many businesses and ideas never make it past conceptualization. We're grateful and appreciative to our customers, friends and support group (our men behind our boutique) that we've made it this far as an online and local pop-up mobile boutique. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll put what funds we do receive towards the purchase of the Covered Wagon Cargo Trailer at Texas Trailer Country (it's the best deal in our greater metropolitan area).</p>
<p>Anything additional we may receive will go towards what we absolutely need to get the mobile boutique trailer up and running. We have some items and systems from our pop-up mobile boutique that we will convert to the trailer, as we plan to use anyways.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Challenges</h3>
<p>Everything comes with risks and challenges whether money is involved or not. We have assumed a lot of the major risks so far just by returning to our ware making roots and it did come with some unique challenges as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>We weren't sure if our current friends and neighbors would be as receptive as the ones prior were.<ul><li><i>We tried and succeeded!</i></li></ul>
</li>
<li>We had to learn the challenges of internet systems and other technology to sell online and through social media organically.<ul><li>
<i>We are continuing to demonstrate our ability to do so on:</i><ul>

</ul>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>We had to research how to reach out to the community through artist and boutique markets. <ul><li><i>We found them and are friends with market and festival organizers!</i></li></ul>
</li>

</div></div>","About Us and Our Philosophy
The Gypsy Rose Boutique is a mother-daughter small business committed to protecting the environment as we educate through art and connect with our community through nature by our sales of handmade natural products and art, such as jewelry, photography and more.
Our Mother, Carol, was born with a gypsy soul. In her past life, she traveled the country with other like-minded people by helping with their adventures and turned to making her own wares on the side. She eventually tamed her traveling spirit to settle down and start her family. She continued her sales career full time for the next 30 years and earned a Master's Degree of Education in Curriculum and Instruction.

Our daughter, Kristen, was born with the same kind of spirit and was always ""on the go,"" as her mother and even grandmother were before her. Kristen gained inspiration from her elders to create her own wares and began selling them to friends throughout her time in school as a child. As she began her sales career at 16, she started learning more about business and her retail sales career progressed over the next 14 years. During her college years, Kristen began focusing more on business and learning about the environment and nature through Natural Science study.

As our Mother was nearing retirement and our daughter suffered a tragedy that stopped her retail career suddenly in 2013, an idea was born. They went back to their traveling, ware making roots. Though successfully selling their products online and in the community individually, they realized they were replicating their efforts and needed more efficiency. 
In May 2016, they combined their ideas and efforts to create The Gypsy Rose Boutique. Currently, The Gypsy Rose Boutique has reached out to the community more than ever through pop-up markets, online markets and social media to sell their natural products and to educate others about the importance and beauty of our environment. The Gypsy Rose Boutique was welcomed with open arms and invited to sell their natural products at local artist markets and the Galveston Art League for display of their nature, topography and other landscape photography. 

The Gypsy Rose Boutique has grown substantially over the last few months online. Website and marketplace traffic and sales have increased, social media following and engagement continues to grow, and the community is not only becoming more aware of the boutique, but also what we stand for.
The Gypsy Rose Boutique is about promoting the conserving and admiring of nature through our natural handmade jewelry and other products. We believe in supporting other small businesses by ensuring we are purchasing natural materials from them that are made or sold in the USA. We carefully review the regions where our materials are mined or imported and do our best to choose local suppliers that are as conscientious about their products as we are about ours.
The Gypsy Rose Boutique's philosophy is to be as environmentally-friendly as possible and to minimize our carbon footprint. We not only hand make our products and use natural materials, we also find vintage items to resell or repurpose. We keep our operations as efficient as possible. We are nearly paperless and completely mobile. We ensure are trucks are in good repair to minimize mobile emissions, only use as much electricity as necessary for our mobile community sales to do our part to help reduce point source emissions and follow the nature-respecting philosophy of ""leave no trace.""

We want to continue our philosophy and take The Gypsy Rose Boutique to the next level, but we will need some help from you.
We are requesting assistance with covering the purchase a cargo trailer and its set up as a truly mobile boutique. 
​
We believe this addition of the cargo trailer will help us reach out to more people in our community, further educate about the importance of preserving our environment and improve our efficiency by:

Allowing us to display more items that need protection from the Gulf Coast weather.
Including more educational type items with the additional protected space.
Easing the strenuous physical setup and take down efforts required for a mobile pop-up boutique.
Further reducing our impact on the environment by reducing the need for multiple vehicle trips to load and unload equipment and products for pop-up market shows.

The Gypsy Rose Boutique will be able to focus more on our community with this addition of a cargo trailer. Your contributions will not only help us achieve our business goals, but will help make our community more nature savvy and environmentally aware by helping us demonstrate that environmentally-friendly business is possible and natural handmade products are also budget-friendly for consumers.

Our Goal is to Raise $12,500 for Our Trailer
We're aiming to raise enough funding, with your help, to assist with our purchase a cargo trailer and its setup as a mobile boutique trailer. Everything will cost approximately $12,500 total.

What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal
We're grateful to have the opportunity to reach out to the crowdfunding community and connect with backers. It's an amazing and exciting experience for us!
We realize many businesses and ideas never make it past conceptualization. We're grateful and appreciative to our customers, friends and support group (our men behind our boutique) that we've made it this far as an online and local pop-up mobile boutique. 
If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll put what funds we do receive towards the purchase of the Covered Wagon Cargo Trailer at Texas Trailer Country (it's the best deal in our greater metropolitan area).
Anything additional we may receive will go towards what we absolutely need to get the mobile boutique trailer up and running. We have some items and systems from our pop-up mobile boutique that we will convert to the trailer, as we plan to use anyways.

The Impact
Your contributions will impact the community and the environment in so many little ways that will help inspire others for generations to come.
You will be helping:


Educate others about our environment.

Inspire others to focus on environmentally-friendly businesses and lifestyles.

Show the affordability of natural and USA made products to communities.

Demonstrate support for local, environmentally-friendly, small businesses.


Local Economics and Our Deliverance of Your Impact
The mobile truck sales industry has made a comeback over the last decade and is still growing. Businesses are enjoying the freedom and affordability mobile sales offers, consumers love the benefit of mobile purchasing and are beginning to demand the convenience mobile shopping and dining offer them. The mobile fashion and food trucks of today are increasing consumer buying and trust!

Read: Fashion Trucks Takeover Downtown Houston
We have a strong small business and artist community in the Greater Houston/Galveston area. Houston has become major hub for the arts, shopping and dining which spans to the suburban and outlying areas. More markets and festivals are popping up each weekend all over the region, year round, which is starting to position the Greater Houston/Galveston area into competition with our Austin neighbor.

We understand our online and community market. We're confident that we can live up to the expectations and demands mobile shopping consumers desire. We just need a little of your assistance to help us reach out to them in the most environmentally and economically friendly way possible.


Overcoming Challenges
Everything comes with risks and challenges whether money is involved or not. We have assumed a lot of the major risks so far just by returning to our ware making roots and it did come with some unique challenges as well.

We weren't sure if our current friends and neighbors would be as receptive as the ones prior were.We tried and succeeded!

We had to learn the challenges of internet systems and other technology to sell online and through social media organically.
We are continuing to demonstrate our ability to do so on:
Etsy
Our website (Powered by Etsy)
Facebook Page
Facebook Group
Twitter
Instagram
and more to come!



We had to research how to reach out to the community through artist and boutique markets. We found them and are friends with market and festival organizers!

We overcame the challenges of avoiding plastics and other environmentally harmful man-made materials which are cheaply produced through outsourcing to foreign countries.We found genuinely natural suppliers locally and in the USA by researching online and learning from our community. Now, they are our suppliers!

We need to be more readily available to our community market in desire and we don't have a storefront.We're reaching out to you to help us raise enough funding for our cargo trailer and mobile boutique setup!


The entire process of establishing an environmentally-friendly, handmade boutique resulted from personal challenges we overcame. Our mother retired and our daughter was injured in a major, not at fault, auto accident with an on-duty State of Texas employee which left her without work, limited her ability to work because of spinal injuries and no transportation in 2013.
Our daughter sought to keep working by returning to her ware making roots combined with her education in natural sciences and retail experience. She carefully planned her next vehicle to keep in line with our mobile boutique trailer goals by purchasing a more environmentally-friendly truck and she is now working the boutique full-time.

Together, our Mother and Daughter overcame personal challenges which resulted in the successful creation of The Gypsy Rose Boutique.
There will always be challenges and risks. Going forward, we will tend and adjust to them as we have in the past. We know what our abilities and limitations are and we're savvy enough to find resources to help overcome obstacles.

<p><b>I love cooking! </b>I love seeing my family and friends comforted by my cooking.  The biggest compliment is when they ask for seconds.

<p>When she passed away in 2002, I took the lead in preparing family dinners, and seeing how much my family enjoyed the meals I realized just how well I could cook. They constantly told me my cooking reminded them of Big Mama’s and that I should open up my own restaurant so they could have the food all year long.  I loved the idea…I just knew I wasn’t moving back to Chicago, so I put the idea on the back burner. For the past 14 years I’ve focused on my career as a financial controller; however, my passion for cooking has not waned.  While my career has been fulfilling, it has not provided the pleasure and passion I feel when I'm in the kitchen and serving friends and family.  This is why I’ve decided to pursue my dream of opening up <i><strong>Molly’s Soulful Café</strong></i>. </p>

<p>Since incorporating earlier this year the team has been working hard to secure the funds required.  Our current commitments from friends, family, and Marlo herself have us at about 40% of our start-up costs.  We are in negotiations with investors that should help us reach 70 - 80% of our goal.  Your generous support will help us reach our ultimate goal and make Molly's Soulful Cafe a reality.  </p>

“Soul Food” is a term used for an ethnic cuisine, food traditionally prepared in Southern United States. The style originated during American slavery and has been passed down from generation. Molly’s Soulful Café looks to build on this tradition by continuing the recipes that Big Mama passed down to Marlo “Molly” Stroud.  
 
Meet Marlo 'Molly' Stroud
 

I love cooking! I love seeing my family and friends comforted by my cooking.  The biggest compliment is when they ask for seconds. I’ve been cooking as long as I can remember.  By age  9, I was cooking entire meals…from fried chicken with smothered potatoes and collard greens to homemade pancakes, waffles, and biscuits. 
Growing up I spent a lot of time with my grandparents and remember watching my grandmother, Big Mama prepare meals for our entire family. Basically, she taught me everything I know, and it's her recipes that I will be using at Molly’s Soulful Café.  
When she passed away in 2002, I took the lead in preparing family dinners, and seeing how much my family enjoyed the meals I realized just how well I could cook. They constantly told me my cooking reminded them of Big Mama’s and that I should open up my own restaurant so they could have the food all year long.  I loved the idea…I just knew I wasn’t moving back to Chicago, so I put the idea on the back burner. For the past 14 years I’ve focused on my career as a financial controller; however, my passion for cooking has not waned.  While my career has been fulfilling, it has not provided the pleasure and passion I feel when I'm in the kitchen and serving friends and family.  This is why I’ve decided to pursue my dream of opening up Molly’s Soulful Café. 
The Business

Molly’s Soulful Café is more than a passion project of Marlo “Molly” Stroud. Since relocating to Studio City, she has searched for a good soul food restaurant and has been unsuccessful which is why she plans to open Molly's on Ventura Blvd.  
Sherman Oaks has a population of over 60,000 people.  It is a family community with 51% reporting to be married.  It is an economically sound population with a median income of $69,651 and over 60% college graduates. It also has a thriving dining community but lacks the options for soul food cuisine. Add to this the growing diversity in the community and you have a recipe for success.
Molly’s Soulful Café looks to fill this gap in service. 
The Money
We project that the restaurant start-up costs will be $250,000 overall. These funds will cover the costs of formation, legal, accounting, furniture, fixtures, equipment, personnel, training and miscellaneous costs.  This will also help with continuing costs of salaries, rent, and insurance.  
Since incorporating earlier this year the team has been working hard to secure the funds required.  Our current commitments from friends, family, and Marlo herself have us at about 40% of our start-up costs.  We are in negotiations with investors that should help us reach 70 - 80% of our goal.  Your generous support will help us reach our ultimate goal and make Molly's Soulful Cafe a reality.  
Your donation and investment through this campaign will help us acquire equipment, permits, and licenses.  We feel confident, that with your support we will be able to reach our goal and open the doors to Molly's Soulful Café in January 2017.  
The Menu

 


Molly’s Soulful Café will host beer and wine tasting and serve up soul food staples like:

Baked macaroni and cheese
Roasted Chicken
Red beans and rice
Fried Chicken
Fried Catfish
Grilled and baked salmon
Collard greens with smoked turkey

<p><span>            Hi My name is Robert Jackson I am 24 years old and I am the extremely proud owner of a marketing firm known as AdGlass. In 2010 I graduated from Lahser High School in Bloomfield Hills Michigan and went on to attend Saginaw Valley State University. After a semester I returned home to attend Oakland Community College and to work to help provide for my family. I am the third oldest child of 7 and the oldest of the males. Upon my return I worked 3 sales jobs that were able to open my eyes and save me from becoming another deadbeat. These jobs taught me what it meant to work smarter and not harder. They also kept me in front of consumers who in a lot of cases had similar financial issues that I had. Seeing this I began to brainstorm ways to get my clients paid. Almost 2 years later the idea of AdGlass came to me. After a lot of research and hard work I was able to find a way to benefit businesses and consumers all at the same time. </span></p>
<br/><p>         I grew up in a strict Christian home in the city of Detroit. My dad was a  painter and my mom stayed at home. My dad was fortunate enough to obtain work that was able to move our family to one of Michigan’s most prestigious areas, Bloomfield Hills. I went from going to school with the children of low income households on free lunch to going to school with children who get the newest gadget as soon as it came out while ordering carryout for lunch. This was frustrating. The thing that frustrated me the most was that I couldn’t afford those things and neither could my family. fortunately, I did not let the story end that way.</p>
<br/><p>            Now I am up everyday at 5 am working to push this business through. I spend hours a day cold calling and canvassing for business and developing the brand. I am my own marketing manager, sales manager, salesperson, custodian, brand ambassador, account manager and accountant. I wear a lot of different hats for this company. I am looking to obtain capital to help build the brand image by effectively placing AdGlass Custom Decals on passenger vehicles across Metro Detroit. There are two main purposes of this business and they are: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Increase the brand awareness of campaigning companies.</p></li>
<li><p> Get consumers paid for helping build the brand.</p></li>
</ol>
<br/>Right now I am offering my drivers between $100 to $300 per month for allowing an AdGlass decal to be on their vehicle. This extra money may be helping a family to eat, keep the lights, heat or water on or simply go on vacation. Whatever the purpose is, they want or need the money. The driver should be compensated for advertising for a company who is making money off of the ad PERIOD. AdGlass is a company designed for the people. Without people to sell to, businesses would not exist. Therefore I feel as though my part to humanity is to be able to give back to those people who shop businesses. To be able to help them stay on top of their bills. Ultimately it will only boost our economy. <br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need your support! </p>
<p>In order for me to get 90 drivers on the road and paid we need to raise $130,600.00.</p>
<p>Here is where the money will go:</p>
<p>$40,500 will be paid out over the course of 3 Months to 30 different drivers for allowing 3 LARGE decals on their vehicle.</p>
<p>$31,500 will be paid out over the course of 3 months to 30 different drivers for allowing 2 LARGE decals on their vehicle.</p>
<p>$22,500 will be paid out over the course of 3 months to 30 different drivers for allowing 1 LARGE decal on their vehicle.</p>
<p>$18,000 is the total cost of printing and installing the LARGE decals.</p>
<p>$1500 will go towards the development of 3 animated AdGlass Commercials for advertising.</p>
<p>$600 will go towards perfecting our current website. (<a href=""http://www.theadglasscompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theadglasscompany.com</a>)</p>
<p>$1000 will go to obtaining ALL the proper legal documents for the campaigns to operate smoothly and in order.</p>
<p>$15,000 will go to the development of the AdGlass APP which our drivers will use to show routes taken and times the routes were taken. This will make proving the value of the AdGlass campaign easier.</p>

</h3><p>The Meadan Brewery was founded to provide a solution for thirsty folks with gluten intolerance looking for a hoppy, tasty beer to help them get through the day. Our beers contain no barley, wheat or gluten whatsoever, making them perfect for all gluten-intolerant beer lovers.</p><p></p><p>I am Bryan Meadan, the founder of Meadan Craft Brewing.</p>In 2006, I was diagnosed with celiac disease, which forced me to go on a gluten-free diet. In the beginning, beer was not the thing I missed most (that would be pizza, beer's best friend). But I soon realized how much I wanted a good, cold glass of brew while watching a game, socializing with friends, or lazing on a sunny afternoon. Unfortunately (make that fortunately!), I couldn't find any gluten-free beers that I really enjoyed.<p>So I started brewing my own.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465822706/meadan-brewing_ybvjky.png"" src="""" style=""width: 580.805px;height: 326px;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Bryan the brewer</p><p></p><p></p><p>I have worked as senior management in small start-ups as well as middle management in larger companies, in addition to working as a web programmer and consultant. I am a Sociologist and view the world through both those and technical eyes.  I had reached a certain level of expertise in web programming until I got tired of it. </p><p>Then I started brewing beer and founded the Meadan Brewery in Karmiel.  </p><p>But 7 years before that, I was a homebrewer.  I found a basic recipe for gluten-free beer; but since I couldn't find all the ingredients I needed, I started using buckwheat. After a few mediocre batches and hundreds of bottles, I honed in on the taste I was looking for. A few liters later I had something that beer lovers in general and celiacs in particular would like.</p><p>In 2012, I decided to begin producing my beer commercially. In November 2012, Meadan Buckwheat and Quinoa Ales started being sold in limited edition brews.</p><p>In December 2013, we dropped the quinoa beer and started brewing Chickpea Ale (hummus beer).</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In May 2015, we opened our new brewery in Karmiel, a growing city in the beautiful Galilee region.

Our beers contain no barley, wheat or gluten whatsoever, making them perfect for all gluten-intolerant beer lovers.I am Bryan Meadan, the founder of Meadan Craft Brewing.In 2006, I was diagnosed with celiac disease, which forced me to go on a gluten-free diet. In the beginning, beer was not the thing I missed most (that would be pizza, beer's best friend). But I soon realized how much I wanted a good, cold glass of brew while watching a game, socializing with friends, or lazing on a sunny afternoon. Unfortunately (make that fortunately!), I couldn't find any gluten-free beers that I really enjoyed.So I started brewing my own.Bryan the brewerI have worked as senior management in small start-ups as well as middle management in larger companies, in addition to working as a web programmer and consultant. I am a Sociologist and view the world through both those and technical eyes.  I had reached a certain level of expertise in web programming until I got tired of it. Then I started brewing beer and founded the Meadan Brewery in Karmiel.  But 7 years before that, I was a homebrewer.  I found a basic recipe for gluten-free beer; but since I couldn't find all the ingredients I needed, I started using buckwheat. After a few mediocre batches and hundreds of bottles, I honed in on the taste I was looking for. A few liters later I had something that beer lovers in general and celiacs in particular would like.In 2012, I decided to begin producing my beer commercially. In November 2012, Meadan Buckwheat and Quinoa Ales started being sold in limited edition brews.In December 2013, we dropped the quinoa beer and started brewing Chickpea Ale (hummus beer).In May 2015, we opened our new brewery in Karmiel, a growing city in the beautiful Galilee region. That same year we began production of our Date Ale, which would soon become our kosher-for-Passover beverage of choice.The Project Meadan Brewery produces the first kosher-for-Passover beer in Israel. Now we want to bring it to beer lovers in the US.For Passover 2016, Meadan Date Ale hit the local Israeli market with great success. As a small brewery in our first year of operations, we couldn't keep up with the demand – something we plan to avoid next year. International interest was generated as well, and we received requests to ship our beer to the Jewish community in the States.
http://www.timesofisrael.com/this-passover-wash...http://www.hadassahmagazine.org/2016/04/04/beer-kosher-passover/For Passover 2017, we would love to offer our beer in the US. In order to do that, we need special funding for repackaging, permits, distribution, marketing and minor recipe tweaking for the American palate.We currently have two types of kosher-for-Passover Date Ales that will be sold in Israel. We are confident that the same brews can be highly successful in the US market.Supporting this project will not only allow you to put quality beer on your table during that famous week in spring, but will help us get our beers to thousands of good people forced (or choosing) to go on a gluten-free diet.Funding NeedsExporting our brews to the U.S. is a complicated and expensive endeavor.  We will need $25000 in order to do the following:

Get additional Kosher certifications to reach the largest target audience possible.


Get GMP certification in addition to what we have now.


Repackage the product, including 4-packs, new cartons and labelling. 


Send samples prior to export.  


Attend events in the U.S. (like Kosherfest).  

Risks and ChallengesProducing beer in Israel and then exporting to the US presents a number of challenges including logistics, permits, distribution, and reaching target markets. We plan on working with highly experienced importers and distributors to help us get our Kosher-for-Passover beer to the US Jewish community in as many states as possible. This will require serious planning and marketing. We plan to get the word out through as many channels as we can, and in the fall of 2016 we hope to attend Kosherfest, the world’s largest and most attended kosher-certified products trade show.In addition to getting our Kosher-for-Passover brews out to the world, we invite you to join in and help us make the world a better (and tastier) place for people with gluten intolerance.Other Ways You Can HelpWe know that not all of you can help financially -- and that's totally all right.  And some of you may never be in Israel to take advantage of some of these perks.There are other ways that you can be a part of this cool project.

I was a successful bee keeper until the introduction of the Varola Distructor mite into our area. loss of production and dead bees made me all but give up.  But I have decided to rebuild in an area that is not yet plagued by the mites with uninfected bees.  I have 155 acres that was heavily logged several years ago and I bought the property with the intent to clean the scrub brush off and turn it into bee forage land.  Unfortunately The task is to big to do with out dedicated equipment built for the purpose.

What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  The funds required are $60000.  20000 for a crawler/dozer to hook out the roots and stumps.  20000 for a mulcher to clear the brush without the need for scraping the soil and with the added benefit of turning the mulch back into the soil. $10000 towards fuel to get the job done and $10000 to seed the acreage to white clover.

If my goal is not reached the money will go toward manually clearing the land at a much slower pace and pore results    The Impact The success of this campaign will provide a much needed source of income for my family:  The products produced will fill a much sought after product for the local area and will take pressure off of world markets. I have been a successful beekeeper in the past and studied under one of the best beekeepers in the province. I have all the other tools and resources to complete a project of this magnitude.  I have hives that are not even put together and have never been used.  I just need to clear this land to make the forage area.    Risks & Challenges  The challenges that I face are what if I am re infected by some stray colony that is infested.  I have the skill set to deal with this problem.
First I plan on using smaller cell size comb which interrupts the mites breeding cycle. Secondly I have contributed to another related campaign who sells Solar Hives that has proven effective at destroying mites.
I use solar powered electric fencing to keep the bears away and use elevated stands to protect the colonies from skunks.

The difficulties encountered are due to the company operating overseas,

<p>Our great wealth is in
nature. We live in it and enjoy it as much as possible. We are especially
enthusiastic about <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">the coast and the sea
as well as the lakes. Bathing and fishing relax and calm us.</span></p>
<p>Imagine being on a
boat surrounded by a beautiful scenery! But if you don’t want or can’t swim and
thus connect even more with the surroundings, it would help if you had a good
view into the depths …</p>
<p>Maybe you’d like to
merge with the surroundings completely.</p>
<p>In that case you need
our product. ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY, incredibly attractive, practical,
TRANSPARENT AND UNBREAKABLE BOAT P A N O R A M I O.</p>
<p>After three years of
planning, designing, and working we have made a product that will help you take
the breath away of your acquaintances who will think that you are sitting on
the surface and rowing!</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy using it
tremendously while not disturbing the water life. The adventure will be all the
more exciting because it enables a breath-taking view up to twenty meters deep.</p>
<p>If you are a
passionate fisherman, your hobby will become even more interesting! </p>

<p>The transport of the
boat from the water to the car is an easy task. Right before you reach the
shore you simply get out of the boat and attach the stabilizer wheels. Then you
roll it away. If you have the stabilizers, that is.</p>
<p><b>      You’ll have no trouble
placing it on the roof of your car by yourself</b>.           You attach it firmly with the
aid of original clamps and off you go to somewhere else.</p>
<p>Before you drive away,
remove the seats, paddles, airbags, net, front and rear handles, and the
battery. Thus you’ll have no trouble driving within the speed limit of up to
130 km/h.</p><p></p><p>                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439364063/vdz3e3exnrvl3jm02c5j.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 373.271794871795px; height: 248px;""/></p>

<p>Using the boat by
night is something special. With a switch you can turn the lighting on and off
as you please. After a few days you simply recharge the battery and use it
again. The battery has about 600 cycles of recharging and will thus serve you
for several years. LED diodes are watertight but not completely waterproof,

<p>The boat’s outer
surface is covered by a special ceramic coating which additionally protects the
boat from minor scratches and UV rays. This special coating also makes sailing
easier because it does not retain water on the surface.</p>
<p>The structure of the
boat is such that in the combination with the stabilizer the bottom of the boat
never touches the ground and thus doesn’t scratch the bottom. Nevertheless,
careful use is advised to preserve the product scratchless for as long as
possible.</p>
<p>Let me emphasize that
potential scratches at the bottom are not visible during the use in the water!</p>

</div></div>","Our great wealth is in
nature. We live in it and enjoy it as much as possible. We are especially
enthusiastic about the coast and the sea
as well as the lakes. Bathing and fishing relax and calm us.
Imagine being on a
boat surrounded by a beautiful scenery! But if you don’t want or can’t swim and
thus connect even more with the surroundings, it would help if you had a good
view into the depths …
Maybe you’d like to
merge with the surroundings completely.
In that case you need
our product. ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY, incredibly attractive, practical,
TRANSPARENT AND UNBREAKABLE BOAT P A N O R A M I O.
After three years of
planning, designing, and working we have made a product that will help you take
the breath away of your acquaintances who will think that you are sitting on
the surface and rowing!
You’ll enjoy using it
tremendously while not disturbing the water life. The adventure will be all the
more exciting because it enables a breath-taking view up to twenty meters deep.
If you are a
passionate fisherman, your hobby will become even more interesting! 



Rowing in it by night
is especially attractive. By turning on the LED diodes you can also enjoy
numerous romantic moments.
   
A                                                                                                                                    
Panoramio is a
completely transparent boat made from an incredibly durable and blow-proof
material – the polycarbonate, which is used in the production of combat
airplane windshields, protective helmets, bullet-proof glass etc. The in-built
frame gives this boat its firmness and form and is made of polished stainless
steel.                                                     
BThe transparent bottom
enables you the unobstructed view of the wonderful underwater world. Whether
you use it by yourself or in the company of another person.
Sitting in the boat
isn’t strenuous because the seats are installed raised from the bottom and are
very comfortable.  The ride is very
stable and simple since the boat is very light. 
                             C
A shelf is installed
in the middle of the boat where you can store beverages or you can stick a
fishing rod into the opening.
You can also use our
original solution for fishing – a nozzle. In this part of the boat you’ll also
find the battery casing. The battery charges the lighting along the sides of
the boat which enables pleasant night rides or fishing.
D
Maximal attention has
been devoted to safety. In front and at the rear there are two airbags which prevent
sinking, and they can be useful also for the user. Additionally, the bottom of
the seat is made of unsinkable Styrofoam that can also be used for help.Styrofoam   150 mm high, front and rear                                                                                                                                    Two inflatable air bags front and rear
E
The boat can be used
in several ways. Seats are movable and face any direction you want. This way
you’ll always be able to find an appropriate and comfortable position. It can
be steered with a double or single paddle.
Rowing standing up is
also possible, just as rowing by sitting on the shelf.1. Rowing standing up (SUP) or by sitting on shelf
                                             2. Seats are movable in any direction you want. It can be steered with a double (two) or single paddle.                     
F
A special handle on
the frame enables easier boarding and exiting and safety fixing on the roof of your car. The anti-slip sheeting prevents
slipping.
                
G
The transport of the
boat from the water to the car is an easy task. Right before you reach the
shore you simply get out of the boat and attach the stabilizer wheels. Then you
roll it away. If you have the stabilizers, that is.
      You’ll have no trouble
placing it on the roof of your car by yourself.           You attach it firmly with the
aid of original clamps and off you go to somewhere else.
Before you drive away,
remove the seats, paddles, airbags, net, front and rear handles, and the
battery. Thus you’ll have no trouble driving within the speed limit of up to
130 km/h.                      
          Original four special handles for easier bording and in same time for easier and safetyer fixing on the roof of the car.                                Remove stabilizer with wheels...                                    
H
Using the boat by
night is something special. With a switch you can turn the lighting on and off
as you please. After a few days you simply recharge the battery and use it
again. The battery has about 600 cycles of recharging and will thus serve you
for several years. LED diodes are watertight but not completely waterproof,
since such do not exist yet.
              - LED diodes 2 meters, 12 V. White or Blue.- Battery dim.: Lenght 150mmxHigh 90mm x Width 65 mm                                                                         AKU LEOCH 12V,  7.2 AH, Battery charger is added.I
The boat’s outer
surface is covered by a special ceramic coating which additionally protects the
boat from minor scratches and UV rays. This special coating also makes sailing
easier because it does not retain water on the surface.
The structure of the
boat is such that in the combination with the stabilizer the bottom of the boat
never touches the ground and thus doesn’t scratch the bottom. Nevertheless,
careful use is advised to preserve the product scratchless for as long as
possible.
Let me emphasize that
potential scratches at the bottom are not visible during the use in the water!
         If the boat does not
have a stabilizer with wheels, we recommend turning it upside down and storing it in this
manner while not in use.
Nevertheless, we have
still designed such a structural solution that even if you put it on the ground
there will be no major damage because the in-built stabilizers are convex thus
preserving the middle of the boat undamaged.JOur tests prove that the hull is extremely resilient. See for yourself.
blow-proof material: airplane windshields etc. 
                                                      K
The product is made by
a machine that we ourselves built for this purpose. A great part of every boat
is hand-made and is valued as such. The extremely demanding, complex, and
expensive procedure – like HITEC, we managed to produce with minimal means but
with a great result.  Designing and model/mould

Our team will try
their best to meet your expectations. All your potential wishes and comments
will be carefully considered. Write to us or simply call.                             To realize our desire to launch the production and thus bring joy to many children,      fishermen, tourists, nature lovers etc. we need you.                                                                    To help us modernize the process, templates, tools, and promotion.                                                  -----------------------------------  IMPORTANT --------------------------------------------

Manufacturing and Production:
Indiegogo projects are a risky undertaking and the reality is that they have the potential to encounter problems in the phases after funding.
We greatly appreciate the vote of confidence and trust our backers have put in us and in our project. We are working hard to avoid issues and have been planning a contingency strategy to get the products to the backers and fulfill our goal of getting more people rowing Panoramio boat.
Our combined experience and a network of resources will allow us to quickly react to eventual issues. More importantly, we are doing our homework beforehand so that we do not run into unexpected problems.
We have more than 25 years experience designing and manufactoring.

</div></div>","Short Summary


Anxiety and depression are very common mental illnesses.  In the United States alone, forty million adults suffer from anxiety, and 14.3 million struggle with depression.  You may even know someone who is debilitated by worries, fears and even panic attacks.
Most of us at some point experience sadness or loneliness.  However, when individuals do not even have the energy to get out of bed in the morning or when they feel unmotivated, overwhelmed, or helpless, they may be experiencing a major depression. Does this sound like someone you know?
There is nothing worse than being in a relationship filled with constant arguments and poor communication, a relationship that contains little more than pain and distance.  Sometimes couples may feel stuck in their relationship, believing that they are the only one who feels this kind of loneliness.  Fifty percent of couples in committed relationships end-up separating because they do not receive support and guidance.
However, there is hope! Studies have shown that counseling is very effective in helping individuals overcome their fears, in reducing feelings of despair and hopelessness. 
My name is Rossana Sierra-Swiech, and I am a Licensed Clinical Therapist with a private practice and more than 13 years of experience.  I know what it is like to live with anxiety and how detrimental it can be to living a life of joy and fulfillment.  I know because I watched with sadness for years as a close family member suffered from anxiety.  After much encouragement, he sought help, and he has since learned skills that allow him to effectively manage his anxiety.  This is my reason for wanting to reach out to others, to offer them hope and the promise of a better tomorrow.

Unfortunately, one third of Americans suffering from anxiety, depression or relational problems do not receive counseling because they are uninsured or have too little income.  My vision is to provide counseling services to anyone who wants them, regardless of their financial situation.  I’d like to ask you to partner with me to make this possible.  Join me in bringing hope and freedom to the lives of others so they can live a fulfilling life. Your contributions will give individuals the opportunity to receive counseling services, therefore offering them the gift of hope.   PLEASE NOTE THAT THE EXAMPLE OF THE CLIENT ON THE VIDEO IS IN NATURE HYPOTHETICAL AND AND EXAMPLE OF THE CLIENTS I SEE.

 What We Need & What You Get

My goal is to raise $60,000, which will make it possible for 30 individuals or couples to receive weekly counseling service for an entire year.  If I do not reach my entire goal, I will use your donations to provide services for as many people as I can with the funds available.  
The following is a breakdown of how your donations will subsidize weekly therapy sessions for an individual or a couple.
$160.00 = 1 month of weekly sessions.
$320.00 = 2 months of weekly sessions. 
$960.00 = 6 months of weekly sessions.
$1920.00 = 1 year of weekly sessions. 
Aside from the gratification that you will have by bringing hope to the life of another, I do have some perks to express my gratitude to you.  Check out the ""Perks"" section for details.   The Impact You can make a difference in the life of another person!  You have the ability to reach out to someone and bring hope to his/her life!  With your donations, you can make this world a better place!

goal is to put a robot in every household and positively impact the ways in
which we interact with technology. One of the driving forces behind Nixie was
enhancing our everyday lives. Nixie is able to fill multiple roles within a
household or office such as a learning aid, security guard, personal assistant,
and much more. </p>
<p>Everyone at Nxt Robotics
wants to build and sell robots. More than that, we want to make robotic
technology accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere. Every individual,
household, and office has different needs. Nixie fills the gaps while enhancing
the lives of those around Nixie.</p>

<div>One of our passions resides around helping children - specifically children in hospitals. Our goal is simple: for every 25 Nixies that are sold, we'll donate 1 Nixie to a Children's Hospital. </div>

<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">One of our perks, ""Nixie Heals Children"" allows contributors to purchase 2 Nixie's (for a total of $998 ) and donate one to a Children's Hospital.

<p>Nixie was originally designed by Jeff as a robot for his family. Jeff initially conceived of a small robot that could assist his family in ways traditional technology could not. Jeff consulted his friends, family and colleagues for input in what they would want a robot to do around their house or office. After receiving feedback and researching how robotic technology can enhance lives, Jeff set out to take Nixie from the concept stage into physical reality. Gathering a dynamic team of creative minds, Nixie’s body and  technology were designed and assembled. However, Nixie’s journey is far from finished. The next phase of Nixie’s journey is now up to you.</p>

<p>It's not enough to simply bring devices into our lives - we need to make sure that we don't introduce new ways to unexpectedly reduce privacy. Nixie incorporates a ""Privacy Mode"" that is enabled via speech or a mobile device. For instance, you can simply say “Ok Nixie, Privacy Mode"" and if Nixie is facing you it will turn completely away and disable its camera for a set period of time (you can set the privacy timeout). If you forget to tell Nixie to come out of privacy mode, don't worry - after the preset privacy time has expired Nixie will be back to its  normal interactive mode.</p>

<hr/></div>","Who we are and what we're offering


Nxt Robotics is made up of a
group of roboticists and designers from a variety of professional fields. Our interests and
backgrounds shaped Nixie into a versatile and unique robot. Nixie is a mobile
intelligent platform for the home and office. The role that Nixie plays in your
home and office is determined by YOU. The way that Nixie looks can be decided
by YOU. When Nixie is described as a personal, customizable robot, we mean
it.  We’re offering Nixie as early-bird,
pre-holiday, customize body, and crowdfunding pricing. 



Benefits


It takes great applications to make hardware great. We created a full package of applications to take complete advantage of Nixie's extensive list of capabilities. Here is a list of the applications and their benefits:





Our Mission

At Nxt Robotics, our
goal is to put a robot in every household and positively impact the ways in
which we interact with technology. One of the driving forces behind Nixie was
enhancing our everyday lives. Nixie is able to fill multiple roles within a
household or office such as a learning aid, security guard, personal assistant,
and much more. 
Everyone at Nxt Robotics
wants to build and sell robots. More than that, we want to make robotic
technology accessible and affordable to everyone, everywhere. Every individual,
household, and office has different needs. Nixie fills the gaps while enhancing
the lives of those around Nixie.



Nixie In Hospitals

One of our passions resides around helping children - specifically children in hospitals. Our goal is simple: for every 25 Nixies that are sold, we'll donate 1 Nixie to a Children's Hospital. 

One of our perks, ""Nixie Heals Children"" allows contributors to purchase 2 Nixie's (for a total of $998 ) and donate one to a Children's Hospital. The donor has the option of having their name (or logo) permanently placed on the body. 


Nixie's Journey

Nixie was originally designed by Jeff as a robot for his family. Jeff initially conceived of a small robot that could assist his family in ways traditional technology could not. Jeff consulted his friends, family and colleagues for input in what they would want a robot to do around their house or office. After receiving feedback and researching how robotic technology can enhance lives, Jeff set out to take Nixie from the concept stage into physical reality. Gathering a dynamic team of creative minds, Nixie’s body and  technology were designed and assembled. However, Nixie’s journey is far from finished. The next phase of Nixie’s journey is now up to you.



We Care About Privacy and Security



It's not enough to simply bring devices into our lives - we need to make sure that we don't introduce new ways to unexpectedly reduce privacy. Nixie incorporates a ""Privacy Mode"" that is enabled via speech or a mobile device. For instance, you can simply say “Ok Nixie, Privacy Mode"" and if Nixie is facing you it will turn completely away and disable its camera for a set period of time (you can set the privacy timeout). If you forget to tell Nixie to come out of privacy mode, don't worry - after the preset privacy time has expired Nixie will be back to its  normal interactive mode.


Our software
development team has a strong background in application and network security.
We understand that Nixie will be in your homes and offices as well as our homes
and offices. We want to make sure that personal spaces stay private. Software
security is one of the most important tenets of our development team and will
continue to be with each new upgrade, app, and feature.



A Little Bit of Our History
As Nixie’s prototype development progressed, the team was convinced they had created something special.  They found that Nixie is so much fun to be around that it would be great to offer it to the world. And so we embarked on a fun and amazing adventure...



Planning/review sessions





The birth of Nixie's design




Additional Connectivity 

Nixie's development team has been hard at work with designing and testing control to/from Nixie with the following 3rd party products:  


Controlling Nixie with the human brain


Interaxon Muse 


NeuroSky MindWave 




Displaying videos or other visual information to a connected television or monitor

Chromecast (via NixieCast™) 


NOTE: See FAQ section for where to purchase these devices separately.




Making Nixie YOURS


Nixie's body has 30 strong rare earth magnets embedded inside. 


That means that you can add metallic or magnetic parts that will stay in place as Nixie move's about its location. 
Also, Nixie's face is able to be easily customized to whatever you like... Below are a few examples of the faces (with blinking eyes) that you can configure on Nixie. Life doesn't always have to be so serious - have a little fun! 

  

  

  

In addition to all of the fun goodness, we can also customize Nixie for you. Simply choose the Custom Nixie perk and tell us how you'd like your Nixie accessorized.

Hello! 
As you may know, Guatemala is a BEAUTIFUL country full of life and colors, hardworking and humble people.
The Antigua Guatemalan economy relies on agriculture and hardworking artisans that make up more than half of the country's economy. The informal economy is essential, and is mainly made up of the following:
- Agriculture 
- Textiles
- Fishing 
- Commerce 
- Handcrafting
Hand-crafters create beautiful things with textiles. Hand-crafting faces a serious risk. They (hand-crafters) are not generating enough income to sustain their families, forcing them to look for alternative occupations, shrinking one of Guatemala's biggest markets. 






So we came up with this idea!
Searching for hand-crafters in need we found Doña Graciela. 
Doña Graciela is a 74 year old hard-working hand-crafter woman who has a disease in her nerves. This disease has a direct impact in her eyes, affecting her skills at hand-crafting. 
She owns a retail store in Antigua, Guatemala. 
We want to raise money to help her Guatemalan art selling business grow and finance her medical expenses due to the fact that she can't afford them. 

This is important for us because we really like to help others. If we have the opportunity to help, then we will. The only reason we do this public is because we don't have the money. 
We are a group of Guatemalan teenagers that feel the obligation to do something for our country. We truly believe this world could be a better place, one country at a time. Starting with Guatemala. 
 What We Need & What You Get Primarily, we need to help Doña Graciela with her illness, then with her business. She has so much talent that is not recognized worldwide. Because her hand made products have so much potential, we as a group, will help her in the recognition of her products:  We need $3,000
- $1,000 for Graciela's illness (Medical checkups + treatment)- $1,000 for the products she's selling- $1,000 for the store upgrade As you can see, we have unique Guatemalan perks that you will not be able to find outside Guatemalan territory  (take a look at the gallery)! So besides helping, you will be recompensed not only by helping someone in need, but also by obtaining Guatemalan unique and original products! Thus, we have an incredible variety to offer, from bags and purses to original paintings only found in Guatemala.  Invite your friends to contribute! :)

As said, the funds will go to finance Doña Graciela's business and her struggling disease.  


The Impact Even though this campaign is specifically to help Doña Graciela get through her disease and help her business, we believe it will also help the Guatemalan hand-crafting business to be recognized globally.   
Risks & Challenges
The obstacles we might encounter regarding the campaign could be Doña Graciela's health might suffer a wrong turn. By helping us as soon as posible, we can prevent this kind of event and help boost her business to obtain a good income. 
Besides Graciela's health we will also notify you the challenges and obstacles that we may face while doing this project by mail. Also, the Guatemalan postal service may not be efficient enough, so we might experience some delay with the shipping of some perks.    
Other Ways You Can Help If you just can't contribute don't worry, that doesn't mean you can't help! 
By sharing this on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or mail you could help us make some noise about this campaign and you could help Doña Graciela get better and improve her quality of life :)

I'm Kerry. I create, design and wrap personalised chocolate gifts and favours for
weddings, birthdays, hen parties and many more occasions. In 2004 my husband left the Royal Air
Force, and so to bring in extra money to support our family, I started a
business. Wrapped for You provides personalised chocolate gifts and favours for
all sorts of special occasions and events. I have spent the last ten years running my business, and with your help I'm looking to take
it to the next level. 
My personalized chocolate gifts are high
quality, inexpensive, and designed from my home with love and care. 
Here are a few testimonials from satisfied
customers:
""Absolutely perfect for our wedding
favours with a few left over to scatter on the tables, and also an extra one as
a keepsake from Kerry. What a thoughtful thing to do, thank you so much!""""What service! Ordered the mini
personalised wedding chocolates on Saturday and they were delivered Tuesday.
They look lovely. One very happy customer, thank you so much!""
Take a look at my website: www.wrapped4you.co.ukWHAT GIFTS CAN I BUY?
All sorts! Over the last ten years I've
expanded my range to include wedding favours, Christmas chocolates,
christening-themed chocolates and even chocolates for hen parties. At the moment they're all made of milk chocolate - but I intend to expand my flavour range to make mint chocolate gifts too.
HOW ARE THEY MADE?
I order the chocolates ready foil wrapped from English and Swiss suppliers and design the packaging. The gift boxes will be made by a company
called Pendragon Packaging. 
WHAT'S IN THEM?
All my gifts are made of milk chocolate.
They're suitable for vegetarians, and they don't contain alcohol. I can include
an ingredients list.  
CAN I BUY THEM?
Of course! You can buy my personalised chocolate
gifts from any country in the world. I currently sell them on Etsy, on Amazon,

</div></div>","Hello Family & Friends! 


I have recently been selected to participate in the 2015-2016 Dallas Mayors Star Council leadership program. Through this program I will have the opportunity to learn more about the inter-workings of the community of Dallas under the direction of the office of Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. We will pinpoint exactly WHERE and HOW we can create initiatives to promote a better city within. Aside from the leadership program, some of my personal goals are to bring progressive ideas and strategies to the City of Dallas that make an impact in economic and small business empowerment, professional development and job creation, and overall raising the standard of how business and relationships are conducted/managed in the DFW Metroplex among the African-American community.  


I have created a Purpose Funding campaign based off of one of my favorite slogans, ""Think Global - Act Local"" I believe having this mentality in everything that we do will help us make immediate impacts on what we do on a micro level while keeping in mind the bigger picture of how it impacts the bigger picture. We should always keep in mind the bigger picture here in Dallas specifically when it comes to how we govern our laws and policies to ensure we do not stifle the potential of our youth simply because we ""Act Local"" or from a place of self. We simply cannot advocate for one without impacting the other Globally. Having this mindset with everything that we do gives us the perspective that we can make a global change starting locally. 


With your generous donations, you will be providing a once in a life-time opportunity for me to collaborate with some of Dallas's brightest emerging leaders to begin our quest for change. Under the council of the office of Mayor Rawlings, I will not only have the opportunity to first learn the structures and formalities of this great city, but also the opportunity to bring fresh progressive ideas to those with a heart and mind to listen.
   What We Need & What You Get Let me break it down in more detail:  $500.00 is needed to go towards class materials and costs to go through the Mayors Star Council leadership program. I've decided to reach out to the people in my life that have shaped, molded, and inspired who I am today. i chose to do this because I want to give back to the people who may have not been blessed with the opportunity to truly be raised by a village. Also, I wanted you, my friends and family to be the people who were responsible for allowing me accept and follow through with this opportunity. YOU are my WHY when I feel like what so many of us strive to do everyday, feels like a lost cause.

I've created this purpose funding campaign for you to donate however, I must not only earn your donation but earn your trust that every dollar donated will be felt, cherished, and put to good use over the course of this upcoming year. I have created #ThinkGlobalActLocal duties that I will be performing over the course of July leading up to August 14th and after if need be. Also during my time with MSC I will document and blog about my experience learning about the city of Dallas and my quest to make a positive impact on this City. 
If you'd like to join in this cause use #ThinkGlobalActLocal on your social media platforms when you perform a deed that empowers, inspires, or uplifts someone in your very own community. Start with your home, workplace, place of worship or gathering, then out into your community. My hopes is that this frame of mind will become embedded into how we live our lives daily. 
$500/$25 = 20 people or at every $25 increments.
If 20 people would find it in their hearts to donate $25, I will carry out one of the following small acts of #ThinkGlobalActLocal. You are also welcome to donate any amount that you would like to give to help further my mission to make an impact in the City of Dallas.

<i># the view up the hill</i><br/>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Almost two
years ago we moved from the big capital city of Bucharest to a small
village called Cașva. Dating from 1453, Cașva is situated in
Eastern Transylvania, surrounded by hills, mountains and plenty of nature.
It's the place where Adrian's parents and grandparents grew up , lived and
definitely fell in love with it. <br/></p>
<p>Shortly after moving here we started
feeling a need to give something back to this place and its people. We wanted
to express our gratitude for what they had offered Adrian as a child and also
for the wonderful times still to come.<span> We want to start an initiative to put into practice
the knowledge gained so far , supplemented by those acquired in villages
everyday activities . Currently , with support and help from relatives and
friends especially with tips and lessons , we raise poultry , rabbits and
cultivate vegetables on an 150sm garden.<br/></span></p>
<p><b><span>Our project consists in relocate, recondition and improve this traditional old wooden house,<span> donated by a local
who wanted to demolish it, and
transform it into a small guesthouse with three rooms for accommodation</span></span>. <br/></b></p>
<p>The house was build by her parents in 1961 and wasn’t inhabited for 
almoust three years, that’s why it will need a lot of recondition and 
repairs.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Because our resources are not enough
to develop this project by ourselves, we need  your help
to transform this house into a guesthouse. This process is planned with respect to the area's
specificity and according to the original project and house plan. We will
use the same materials as the ones used when the house was first
built, preserving as much of its architecture as possible. We will keep the stone foundation, and recuperate as much as we can from
 the walls, beams, floor ,roof tiles, windows and doors. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444656876/f4dyy9qw6sbloosrzth1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i># the original project of the house<br/><br/></i>
<p>The
house will be relocated approximately 50m from its current location, on
our own domain, conveniently located next to the main road and Cașva river. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442060627/kezeko9cuitpb1ztljo8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>#
This is the new location. On the right side is Cașva river and the place where
the hammocks will be , and on the left side is the access to the main road.</i><br/>
<p></p>
<p>The house will be entirely
made of wood and features :<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>three bedrooms <br/>
</li>
<li>three bathrooms</li>
<li>a large hallway <br/>

<br/>There is
literally a lot to be done and we want to make this as best as we can,
while keeping everything as an environmentally friendly project. <br/><br/>Here are the
steps that we have to take in order to be able to receive tourists starting october 2016:<br/><br/><ul>
<li> take all the permits and authorizations issued by the authorities 
in law ( Urbanism Certificate, Sanitary-Veterinary Certificate, permit 
to buid a guesthouse from Ministry of Transport , Constructions and  
Tourism )</li>
<li>electrical connection</li>
<li>water connection</li>
<li>make the fence</li>
<li>arrange the land</li>
<li>dismantle the house</li>
<li>rebuild it on the new location </li>
<li>make the interior design according to the planes posted</li>
<li>do the electrical wiring and sanitary pipes</li>
<li>mount the boiler and radiators for heating</li>
<li>instal solar pannel</li>
<li>make a vegetable garden to be used by guests </li>
<li>arrange a playground for
children </li>
<li>arrange chill out area with hammocks by the river </li>
<li>arrange three parking spaces</li>
<li>buy four bicycles</li>
</ul>
<p><span>We
will try to do as much as we can with the amount of money we hope to gather,
and , if we are not going to obtain the whole sum, we will start cutting from
the back of the list. :) <br/></span></p>
<p><span>We want to create a cosy and comfortable interior , as the romanian 
peasant houses are. We already have old furniture for the dining area 
and two bedrooms, furniture donated also by a local.</span></p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Culinary Experience<br/>
</h3> <p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We know that
a journey means visiting new places, meeting new people but also tasting good
food.  We guarantee a pleasant dining experience with local seasonal dishes using vegetables from our garden and local products like
cheese, milk, and meat, all grown free range. They will be cooked by a local cook and accompanied
by an appropriate drink.</p>
<p>The
vegetables to be grown in the garden are from traditional, non-GMO,
seeds, <span>  which we will receive
from our friends from Eco Ruralis, a grassroots association created by
small farmers  who practice non-industrialized sustainable
agriculture, based on environmentally-conscious principles.  </span>
</p>

<p><i># we cultivate tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, beans, radishes, lettuce, spinach, kohlrabi, strawberries </i><br/></p>
<p>The house
will also host a pantry with a lot of traditionally produced goodies, like jam,
syrup or pickles. The products will be manufactured by us, our friends
and neighbors, products which you can also buy, if you find them
irresistible and want to take some with you back home.<br/></p>
<p>Beside the
vegetables from the garden which everyone can use, you will
find local products such as cheese, eggs, honey,
wine, palinka, but also locally provided meat. We assure
you that these products taste incredible and you will have an unforgettable
culinary journey along your travelling here.</p>

</div></div>","Hi There !

I am Bianca and together
with Adrian we want to show you a little piece of heaven, the place we call it
home now.







# the view up the hill


Almost two
years ago we moved from the big capital city of Bucharest to a small
village called Cașva. Dating from 1453, Cașva is situated in
Eastern Transylvania, surrounded by hills, mountains and plenty of nature.
It's the place where Adrian's parents and grandparents grew up , lived and
definitely fell in love with it. 
Shortly after moving here we started
feeling a need to give something back to this place and its people. We wanted
to express our gratitude for what they had offered Adrian as a child and also
for the wonderful times still to come. We want to start an initiative to put into practice
the knowledge gained so far , supplemented by those acquired in villages
everyday activities . Currently , with support and help from relatives and
friends especially with tips and lessons , we raise poultry , rabbits and
cultivate vegetables on an 150sm garden.
Our project consists in relocate, recondition and improve this traditional old wooden house, donated by a local
who wanted to demolish it, and
transform it into a small guesthouse with three rooms for accommodation. 
The house was build by her parents in 1961 and wasn’t inhabited for 
almoust three years, that’s why it will need a lot of recondition and 
repairs.







# the wooden house dating 1961
# old location of the house vs. new location of the house



  Cașva Guesthouse - Where Is the Money Heading To?



Because our resources are not enough
to develop this project by ourselves, we need  your help
to transform this house into a guesthouse. This process is planned with respect to the area's
specificity and according to the original project and house plan. We will
use the same materials as the ones used when the house was first
built, preserving as much of its architecture as possible. We will keep the stone foundation, and recuperate as much as we can from
 the walls, beams, floor ,roof tiles, windows and doors. 


# the original project of the house
The
house will be relocated approximately 50m from its current location, on
our own domain, conveniently located next to the main road and Cașva river. 


#
This is the new location. On the right side is Cașva river and the place where
the hammocks will be , and on the left side is the access to the main road.

The house will be entirely
made of wood and features :

three bedrooms 

three bathrooms
a large hallway 

a kitchen with a dining area 

a porch



# a simulation with the house on our domain. On the left side is the road and on the right side is the river.

# a simulation with the house towards the river.
From 6
to 8 people can be hosted here. Each bedroom will have its own bathroom ,
with double or twin beds. 


There is
literally a lot to be done and we want to make this as best as we can,
while keeping everything as an environmentally friendly project. Here are the
steps that we have to take in order to be able to receive tourists starting october 2016:
 take all the permits and authorizations issued by the authorities 
in law ( Urbanism Certificate, Sanitary-Veterinary Certificate, permit 
to buid a guesthouse from Ministry of Transport , Constructions and  
Tourism )
electrical connection
water connection
make the fence
arrange the land
dismantle the house
rebuild it on the new location 
make the interior design according to the planes posted
do the electrical wiring and sanitary pipes
mount the boiler and radiators for heating
instal solar pannel
make a vegetable garden to be used by guests 
arrange a playground for
children 
arrange chill out area with hammocks by the river 
arrange three parking spaces
buy four bicycles

We
will try to do as much as we can with the amount of money we hope to gather,
and , if we are not going to obtain the whole sum, we will start cutting from
the back of the list. :) 
We want to create a cosy and comfortable interior , as the romanian 
peasant houses are. We already have old furniture for the dining area 
and two bedrooms, furniture donated also by a local.

  The Culinary Experience
 


We know that
a journey means visiting new places, meeting new people but also tasting good
food.  We guarantee a pleasant dining experience with local seasonal dishes using vegetables from our garden and local products like
cheese, milk, and meat, all grown free range. They will be cooked by a local cook and accompanied
by an appropriate drink.
The
vegetables to be grown in the garden are from traditional, non-GMO,
seeds,   which we will receive
from our friends from Eco Ruralis, a grassroots association created by
small farmers  who practice non-industrialized sustainable
agriculture, based on environmentally-conscious principles.  



# we cultivate tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, beans, radishes, lettuce, spinach, kohlrabi, strawberries 
The house
will also host a pantry with a lot of traditionally produced goodies, like jam,
syrup or pickles. The products will be manufactured by us, our friends
and neighbors, products which you can also buy, if you find them
irresistible and want to take some with you back home.
Beside the
vegetables from the garden which everyone can use, you will
find local products such as cheese, eggs, honey,
wine, palinka, but also locally provided meat. We assure
you that these products taste incredible and you will have an unforgettable
culinary journey along your travelling here.

# cheese with dill and pepper

Depending on the time of the year
during which you will visit us , there are different activities to be done :

in the springtime we will prepare the land and plant seedling


# working the land in march


in the summertime you can help us take care of the garden and prepare
     seasonal syrups and jams such as dandelion , elderflower or raspberry
     syrup, black cherry or strawberry jam

</p><p>We have a right to a cannabis farmer’s market!</p>
<p>We have a right to defend this cannabis farmer’s market from
attacks by the police using non-violent arrest resistance tactics – “hug
power”. </p><p>For more information regarding the events of July 1st, 2015, please see this link here: </p><p></p><a href=""http://www.cannabisculture.com/content/2015/07/24/in-defense-of-the-cannabis-farmers-market"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cannabisculture.com/content/2015/07/...</a><p><br/>
</p><p>We are prepared to go to court to argue that the steps we
took are required to force the rest of society to include the poor growers and
poor dealers and stigmatized users into the new “legal marijuana” model. </p>
<p>The current “legalization” of medical marijuana leaves much
to be desired. In terms of the users, it excludes and/or stigmatizes and/or
creates unnecessary barriers for access to cannabis to teens, the poor, and
those who would choose to use cannabis for preventive medicine. It also creates
unnecessary economic barriers for participation in cultivation and retail.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Steven Harper’s “MMPR” system prevents all
but millionaires from participating in the supply of cannabis, while Vancouver
Mayor Gregor Robertson and his council have made it nearly impossible to
participate in dispensing cannabis unless one is in possession of 100 thousand
dollars in infrastructure and another 30 to 35 thousand dollars in licensing. </p>
<p>To activists, throwing 50% to 70% of users and 70% to 90%
percent of the growers and dealers under the bus is unacceptable. To keep the
math simple, activists in Vancouver have adopted the “no smoker/dealer/grower
left behind” rule – we want our economy to be as inclusive as possible, and
leave no harmless people as targets for the police. That means everyone gets a
seat at the legalization table. Everyone is legit. </p>
<p>We are demonstrating how well the farmer’s market model
works by holding it twice a year and defending it with our arrest resistance
tactics – 30,000 people attend and the medical problems are less serious than
Prime Minister Steven Harper’s son’s alcohol-drenched 18<sup>th</sup> birthday
party! If only the Senate Report’s recommendation of 16 years old as a legal
age to buy cannabis were heeded, nobody would have to risk death to participate
in our Prime Minister’s son’s happy celebration! They could have a non-lethal
euphoric option!</p>
<p>But we need your help!</p>
<p>A good lawyer costs money. We need a minimum of 7500.00 just
to get started. With your help, we can defend the right to fight for an
inclusive cannabis legalization market, to make sure everyone can take
advantage of pot peace. </p>

<p>I have surveyed people within my area asking them about their purchase of fast food and an overwhelming number agree that if they had a choice between fast food or good food fast they would buy from Your Kitchen.</p>

Greetings and hugs from our community!
We're group of friends enjoying  design, art, sports, self-improvement, cooking, dancing and dj'ing, biking, sailing, yoga and many many more. 
That's our way of living, exploring the world and improving ourselves. 



Luckily this year we've found a fabulous place where we can live together doing stuff we like. 
It's a little camp in one of the most amazing places in the world. 
We call it - Jamboo, a space which brings happiness and sunshine to our souls.
Our dream now is 
to make visiting Jamboo possible for 
literally everyone.

Yes, you can come here and stay for free for a while. We'll accommodate any traveller who lost ticket or left without money.
Or you can order one of our special trips (see in perks) and spend amazing time with us.
We really want you to visit Jamboo and feel that amazing energy.
Join our movement and make our community grow!



What's so special about this place?


First of all it's on the beach on fabulous tropical island. It's an opportunity for everyone to spend time in paradise and feel the unique Jamboo spirit.




We've preciously gathered best activities 
for your joy and self improvement. 

We can already offer:  yoga, sky-surfing, chakra centre, alfa gravity, human design and freelifing centre, kayaking, massage, acoustic moon sauna, open air gym, photo studio, beauty salon, elephant trapping, bike rides, boat trips, jeep rides, snorkeling and diving, jungle parties, fool moon party, DYI workshops (furniture, lamps and illumination, jewelry), art studio, bike and car driving school.
You can never get bored in Jamboo!

We also have a restaurant with thai, american and european cuisine in our camp.
Check our perks!

Our best proposition is 4 special vacation trips: 
10 days of amazing health, party, extreme or romantic experience. 







Just make a choice how you want to spend your time - going to chakra center and yoga sessions to feel better and explore your soul or visit the best night parties in the world and meet crazy people, go extreme or spend the loveliest and fantastically romantic time with your beloved one.It's not a boring hotel vacation it's something you'll never forget!Welcome to Jamboo!

Location.
Jamboo is situated on the Koh Phangan island in amazing Thailand.Koh Phangan (pronounced KOH pa-nGan with G as in mango) is an island in southern Thailand known as a land of coconut trees and the world famous Full Moon Party (electronic dance music event for around 30,000 party-goers). 

Today Jamboo is a camp where we live. It's capacity is up to 10 people but we're looking to extend it to 50. 





Since we're creative and hardworking friends we're building it ourselves. Our local supporters joined to help.

What We Need to Make it Happen.

Now we're looking to add:
Building and equipment: dock for diving, bamboo for building, kitchen and bar equipment, beach equipment, sport inventory.
Transport: truck for beach cleaning, speed boat to meet guests in airport and trips to national park, quad bike, 4 bikes honda zoom, 1 kawasaki, 1 jeep, 10-12 bicycles, 5 beach segways, jet ski.
New spaces: sports area (tennis, basketball, football, workout space), gardening space, coworking (so you could stay with us and keep working remotely. We'll also have lectures and educational sessions here), spa, souvenir shop.
Electricity: electrics (lamps and illumination), radio sets, we also looking to install sun batteries and wind turbines to gather electricity.

I lost my job which was supposed to bring in an income to have on a weekly basis to work around my modeling and blogging, clearly that didnt happen because they fired me. My Bank account went in the negative by $635 and I am still in debt more than what I can fathom and it sucks! So I am reaching out to you guys for help to get my blog to where it should be. hire a business success coach, work on marketing, redesign my blog and really give it the attention it needs also do the below! so please helping me out with this to accomplish my goals will greatly be appreicated. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443392913/kx54enbpuv8rjewozy5s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span><p>With all of that said after talking to my friend yesterday I decided as a way to keep me motivated to fix this situation that I am going to put together a full complied list of all of the possible ways that I can make money and write goals and deadlines.

I have a blog that  I really take as my pride and joy but to be honest, I have not been able to really blog in the past couple of weeks because I have hit a major snag financially. Which is not good considering a part of the reason I started my blog is because of the fact that I love saving money, and couponing, however I haven’t done much couponing. I lost my job which was supposed to bring in an income to have on a weekly basis to work around my modeling and blogging, clearly that didnt happen because they fired me. My Bank account went in the negative by $635 and I am still in debt more than what I can fathom and it sucks! So I am reaching out to you guys for help to get my blog to where it should be. hire a business success coach, work on marketing, redesign my blog and really give it the attention it needs also do the below! so please helping me out with this to accomplish my goals will greatly be appreicated. With all of that said after talking to my friend yesterday I decided as a way to keep me motivated to fix this situation that I am going to put together a full complied list of all of the possible ways that I can make money and write goals and deadlines. Consider this my Bloggers Income Report Plan, I am going to show where I am at as of today (debt included) where I would like to be in the next few months.What else do I have to lose when I really have nothing.I am even going to research and look into Financial budgeting programs such asPersonalCapital.comMint.comLearnVest.comI figure by me looking into programs like this it will help me to create goals and stick to them and get to it.Current Income Streams May 28, 2015Affiliate IncomeLINQIA AFFILIATE PROGRAM : $0.00Amazon associates: $0Affiliate Window : $0Share A Sale :$0Rakuten Linkshare: $0Comission Junction : $0Chloe and Isabel: $0Zazzle.com: $5.00Kitsy Lane: $121Sunday Coupon Inserts: $0Secret Blogger Business: $0Blogger Babes: $0Blue Host;: $0Vig Link: $0Skimlinks: $0Lookastic: $0Cash Back AppsIndox Dollars: $13.95Swag Bucks: 11 SBParibus: $0Ebates.com: $43.21Snap by Groupon: $9.00Berry Cart: $0Check Out 51: $2.50Shop Kick: $30 (gift card)Ibotta : $282Viggle: 5000 reward pointsJingit: $0Pay Per Click Google Adsense: $1.10Shop Sense: $69Sponsored Posts Tomoson: $0Izea.com $36.00Selling Advertising SpacePassion Fruit Ads: $106Modeling$900Total Income:  $1500with this being my current income and being in debt IT Just goes to show you I have work to do.Current Debt May 28,2015Medical bills: $882GE Bill: $1,098Verizon Wireless: $402Capital one: $762Paypal Credit : $331Student Loans: 21,000Total Debt: $62,400Now If I stick to promoting and build my traffic to my blog and find another part time job continue modeling and use the above streams of income and start coupoing again and add the below to my plan.

<p>Hi, I'm Lisa. With a degree from London College of Fashion, various styling and promotional jobs (even a stint on Harry Potter), my background has been eclectic and fun packed! With children now in the mix I want to continue my creative work by paving a future with an online business that we can nurture and grow! I enjoy giving gifts and believe our balance of useful, fun, unique and edible products makes our boxes not only desirable but something you will want to share.</p>
<p>Nikki</p>
<p>Hi I’m Nikki. I am originally from Lincolnshire but I moved to London to attend drama school where I trained in musical theatre. My early career saw a mixture of acting work and a variety of jobs including many in retail where I learnt to appreciate well made products by companies that really care about their customers. Last year I launched Pluhoo, a web based app for freelancers and the self employed but my passion really lies in products and ecommerce. The idea for Send a Box came about earlier in the year and I haven't looked back since. I am excited to be able to help and feature UK brands and I'm looking forward to getting the boxes out to people in the new year.</p>

<p>We are launching an Indiegogo campaign to generate enough revenue through crowdfunding, to enable us to launch our business -</p>
<p>In total, we are looking to raise £4,500 to buy all of the stock we need and get it off the ground and as a way of incentivising these donations, we are essentially offering a number of ""Perks” as a type of pre-ordering system. So if you like the idea and want peace of mind that you have your gifts sorted for the year, keep donating because we will keep giving you boxes.</p>
<br/><p>We wanted to make sure that everyone gets a reward no matter how much they donate. So anyone who donates below £30 gets a percentage off their first order when we launch our online store (for more info, see our perks section).</p>If we are lucky enough to get more funding we would use this initially for marketing and to introduce more box themes. <br/>

<p><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TRAVELIVING IS NOT ONLY A LIFESTYLE BUT ALSO A SOCIAL CAUSE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>With TRAVELIVING we want to change the perception of the world around us, and make it into a more friendly and accesible place, a world where we can re-create the reality that we want to see, rather than repeat what we have been programmed to believe. </strong></p>
<p><strong>*  For that reason, and because we believe in sharing abundance with the people that most need it, for each 2 Books, box sets or any piece of jewelry sold we will give a box worth of one week of food and clothes to an unprivileged family in Mexico.</strong></p>

<h2>&lt;&lt;&lt; Thank you so much for your time and interest in this quest,  I hope that this book and online series will help you to design the journey of your dreams + empower yourself to travel self-sustainably through Latin Amerikua and help us make the world a safer and more generous place for everyone. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</h2> <p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div></div>","<<TRAVELIVING>> A guide for SUSTAINABLE NOMADS, TRIBAL HACKERS &  TRAVEL SERIES from the roads of Latin Amerikua.
 My name is Maia Balam, Im a Mexican traveler, pro-Indigenous activist and multidisciplinary artist, I have been writing this travel guide for more than 4 years and today its more than ready to be shared with the world. At this point I just need the final push & support from my friends and global community to be able to print the first edition of this Travel guide and share with you my most precious possesion, which is: The maps, codes, stories and hacks that I have been creating and collecting along 10 years of traveling solo through the contienent. 
For many years I´ve been wanting to share my knowledge upon many subjects related to travel, Indigenous people, camping hacks and self-emancipation, and it is today in a world that is being remodeled by Global warming, menaced by corporate violence and political instability, that I know its THE right time to activate and train other people into activism, sustainable traveling and self emancipation.  I know that many of my friends and followers want to learn how to travel in the most sustainable and affordable way, very often people ask me where to go and what to do in Latin Amerikua, so in this book I will share all that knowledge with you:


How to travel on a budget  
How to prepare for camping like a pro
How to be of service to Indigenous communities

Volunteer at diverse projects in different countries

How to take care of yourself, nature and others while creating your income on the road,

How to feel confident and successfully integrate into every country and culture that you want to visit, support or live with. 

After printing the book in December and shiping it to my supporters in January I will also give the project a continuity by producing a Travel show in February with my Partner Jordin Stallman who is my best best ally in this quest and enterprise, and who will help me co-produce & film the travel series in the next  months where we will be traveliving Across Latin Amerikua visiting Ancient Tribes, places of power, sustainable projects, and Indigenous Ecological causes in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, Colombia and Ecuador.
          
By acquiring this book you will be able to design your own journey across Latin Amerikua, prepare and activate yourself into a more sustainable lifestyle, travel hacks to save money,  learn all you need to be a sustainable nomad, visit the most unbelievable and pristine paradises, learn how to cultivate and offer your tools and skills along the way, and as an extra perk you will also be able to follow our journey through social media and get new ideas and inspiration to visit new places and join certain cutting edge projects and communities that we will be showcasing along the way.
 In this book you will find the following content>>

<<<<THE TRAVELIVING TOOLS>>> <<<The impact and goals of TRAVELIVING>>> I want to be able to share with the global conscious community of travelers the tools that allowed me to have a successful nomadic lifestyle, so I will give to you the codes and hacks that had saved me thousands of dollars in every trip and expeditions I have done around the world, but first and foremost: I want to help other people to become a self emancipated and productive member of the human family, because I know a lot of people are breaking their heads into figure out ways to migrate into other countries either for vacation or residence.  Through this book and online travel series we want to help motivate other people to jump into the world and explore what it is to feel free, confident and self assured that the world is a more friendly place that what we have been shown in social media and mainstream news.  
             Ç
 
>>>> TRAVELIVING IS NOT ONLY A LIFESTYLE BUT ALSO A SOCIAL CAUSE >>>>
With TRAVELIVING we want to change the perception of the world around us, and make it into a more friendly and accesible place, a world where we can re-create the reality that we want to see, rather than repeat what we have been programmed to believe. 
*  For that reason, and because we believe in sharing abundance with the people that most need it, for each 2 Books, box sets or any piece of jewelry sold we will give a box worth of one week of food and clothes to an unprivileged family in Mexico.
         
             
 

The Online Nomad video series:  For 2 years I have been writing a travel blog and producing a few pilot chapters of an online series and interviews that I want to build up around the places that I visit every year. The last 2 video chapters where made around Envision Festival costa rica, and on February 2017, I will embark on a new series of chapters with the help of my beloved, Jordin Stallman (who is also a great story teller, artist of all sorts, sound engineer and camera man) and together we will share on video and blogs the exotic locations that we will discover in our journeys, the lessons and travel hacks that we have discovered. We want to share our adventures with our friends, family and community at large, to prove that we can live a different reality and become our own bosses while living our dreams every day if we really place all our efforts, resources and focus into being sustainable, in service to the world around us and free.  ""A new world is possible.""

<h3> Amanecer Counseling Services : Feminist Psychotherapy </h3>
<p>Hola! I'm Amelia Ortega, the founder of Amanecer Counseling Services. Amanecer is a small Feminist psychotherapy practice in New York City.  Individual and family sessions  at Amanecer include building tools and learning techniques to heal from trauma that include somatic approaches ( attention to and use of the body in the healing process).  Amanecer is a new practice that is transitioning in 2017 to become a Worker Owner Cooperative business.  Amanecer is a community based practice- treatment includes connection to community wellness programs and introduction to managing mental health symptoms through mind and body care. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me as both a queer woman of color provider of mental health care and as someone who has been healed by this work.  I've had profound experiences as a witness to hundreds of individuals' movement toward change and liberation centered lives. I've been in social work practice for 13 years and have worked to increase access to meditation, somatic awareness, aromatherapy and expressive arts therapy within communities traditionally not included.  My work has occurred in residential housing, psychiatric hospitals, shelters, and public high schools.  As a radical social worker I am now using my training, experiential knowledge and social justice framework within community mental health services. </p>
<p>As a contributor to this campaign you are supporting mental health practice for queer people of color and health work that acknowledges the impact of systemic oppression on the wellness of our communities.  Your contributions will support our initial Community Therapy Scholarship, which will be provided to clients who are living at or below poverty level, and will ensure that weekly sessions are accessible for free or reduced out of pocket costs.  Your contributions will also support the initial 90 days of overhead to launch this new practice model and to support the transition towards becoming a Worker Owned Cooperative office in 2017. </p>
<p>The wellness of our collective health community will be directly supported by your contributions!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Amanecer Needs &amp; Community Benefits</h3>
<p>I am seeking to raise $5000 to cover the start up costs of this Feminist Psychotherapist Practice.  The funding will be distributed in the following ways:</p>
<p>$2000 will be allocated to cover rent for 2 months. While I have located a low cost space, the landlord is requiring a total of 4 months rent for signing.</p>
<p>$2500 will be placed in the Therapy Scholarship fund. This amount will provide one and half months ( 6 weeks) of weekly sessions or 12 weeks of bi-weekly sessions for 5 low income clients who are not currently covered by insurance for mental health treatment.</p>
<p>$500 will be used to purchase therapeutic tools such as books, children's developmental games and somatic experiencing tools ( stress balls, bi-lateral brain stimulating games and educational resources for our resource library). </p>
<p>As a THANK YOU for supporting this woman of color practice and supporting mental health liberation, contributors will be recognized on a designated wall celebrating community supporters (""This Community supports Feminist practice and Mental Health Liberation"") AND will receive: </p>
<p>$1-$25  A personal thank you card</p>
<p>$26-$50  Above items, plus 3 inspirational pocket cards for daily meditation</p>

<p>$201- $500 All items above, plus a Supreme Self Care and Relaxation package featuring works by local artists </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of your contribution cannot be overstated.  This is a challenging post-election season with many struggles ahead.  Communities of color, queer communities and Muslim communities are being targeted with increased violence . Sustaining community and sustaining ourselves as health workers requires a new approach to building economic and social supports.  Amanecer Counseling is committed to meeting the growing need for accessible, affordable, holistic and non pathologizing treatment in a culturally relevant and anti-oppressive environment. </p>
<p>Please consider contributing to building this new therapeutic space and a new opportunity for community healing.</p>

<p>A truly family affair, Lion &amp; Owl has at its helm Crystal Platt and Kirsten Hansen, a couple whose talents meld as well as their marriage. Crystal brings over 15 years of experience as a chef in Eugene, with a culinary education as a foundation. Her experience as the chef of one of Eugene's most well-regarded restaurants has earned her a following of people excited to be part of her food projects. Kirsten provides the business balance, champagne-loving palate and a warm hospitality to complement the Crystal's creations. Together, they have hosted culinary events and food experiences that people are still talking about; brunch in this super cool environment should be no exception. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Lion &amp; Owl will be a </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">mini restaurant</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> serving brunch on a daily basis. Located in Eugene, Oregon within a vintage 1977 Airstream with adorable indoor seating and an additional outdoor patio, the location itself is </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">unique</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> and quite unlike any other food truck currently in the US.  Focused on our </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">beautiful local products</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, we will  be serving a </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">brunch</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> concept unique to the Eugene market. We plan on bringing an internationally innovative twist to the brunch menu, featuring </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">vegetable-centric</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> items within a framework of recognizable, comforting staples, all accompanied by a well-curated </span><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">sparkling wine</strong><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> selection.</span></p>
<p>Our Eugene <strong>community is important </strong>to us and our business plan also includes two days a month dedicated to feeding the needy in Eugene.  We would like to share the beautiful products made by our farmer friends with everyone, and we are committed to sharing the joy of brunch with all the people in our community, including those less fortunate than ourselves. A great deal of people require our help to have a proper meal, and we would like to provide that in a comfortable environment, allowing those in need to have a true dining experience with dignity and class.</p>
<p>Not only is this our <strong>dream project</strong> (Crystal gets to play with vegetables and great product all day and Kirsten gets to play with bubbles and make people smile all day), but it is what Eugene, Oregon desperately needs.  Brunch is painfully lacking in the Emerald city, and this campaign will help us bring some good eats to many a good people.  The<strong> luxurious comfort of brunch</strong> brings people together, and nothing could make us happier than providing a space for people to gather and eat. We have the airstream, the space, the talent and the support of many hungry folks in Eugene, we just need the capital to get it going this spring.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a <strong>great business plan in place</strong> (we are happy to share it, if you are interested) and the city of Eugene has been very enthusiastic about supporting us with a loan.  However, our current situation doesn't fit into the confines of the federal requirements. Boohoo. We are now reaching to this more creative source of funding to help us launch this spring and build the foundation for this business.</p>
<p>The $30,000 we are striving for in this campaign will help us cover the cost of running the business for this first year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent at our sweet location is $300 month</li>
<li>Licensing and permits will be $1000</li>
<li>Patio buildout &amp; furniture $5000</li>

</div></div>","A truly family affair, Lion & Owl has at its helm Crystal Platt and Kirsten Hansen, a couple whose talents meld as well as their marriage. Crystal brings over 15 years of experience as a chef in Eugene, with a culinary education as a foundation. Her experience as the chef of one of Eugene's most well-regarded restaurants has earned her a following of people excited to be part of her food projects. Kirsten provides the business balance, champagne-loving palate and a warm hospitality to complement the Crystal's creations. Together, they have hosted culinary events and food experiences that people are still talking about; brunch in this super cool environment should be no exception. 
Lion & Owl will be a mini restaurant serving brunch on a daily basis. Located in Eugene, Oregon within a vintage 1977 Airstream with adorable indoor seating and an additional outdoor patio, the location itself is unique and quite unlike any other food truck currently in the US.  Focused on our beautiful local products, we will  be serving a brunch concept unique to the Eugene market. We plan on bringing an internationally innovative twist to the brunch menu, featuring vegetable-centric items within a framework of recognizable, comforting staples, all accompanied by a well-curated sparkling wine selection.
Our Eugene community is important to us and our business plan also includes two days a month dedicated to feeding the needy in Eugene.  We would like to share the beautiful products made by our farmer friends with everyone, and we are committed to sharing the joy of brunch with all the people in our community, including those less fortunate than ourselves. A great deal of people require our help to have a proper meal, and we would like to provide that in a comfortable environment, allowing those in need to have a true dining experience with dignity and class.
Not only is this our dream project (Crystal gets to play with vegetables and great product all day and Kirsten gets to play with bubbles and make people smile all day), but it is what Eugene, Oregon desperately needs.  Brunch is painfully lacking in the Emerald city, and this campaign will help us bring some good eats to many a good people.  The luxurious comfort of brunch brings people together, and nothing could make us happier than providing a space for people to gather and eat. We have the airstream, the space, the talent and the support of many hungry folks in Eugene, we just need the capital to get it going this spring.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We have a great business plan in place (we are happy to share it, if you are interested) and the city of Eugene has been very enthusiastic about supporting us with a loan.  However, our current situation doesn't fit into the confines of the federal requirements. Boohoo. We are now reaching to this more creative source of funding to help us launch this spring and build the foundation for this business.
The $30,000 we are striving for in this campaign will help us cover the cost of running the business for this first year:

Rent at our sweet location is $300 month
Licensing and permits will be $1000
Patio buildout & furniture $5000
Starting food inventory $3000
Opening wine inventory $2000
Cushions for bench seating $2000
Tabletop & silverware $2000
Kitchen equipment $2500

With your contribution, not only will you help build a brunch spot for the hungry in Eugene, you will get our undying love, eternal respect and a permanent reservation at the hottest brunch ticket in town.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
SPREAD THE WORD

<h2><strong>Who We Are &amp; What We Do---</strong></h2>
<p>Two small business owners collaborated to form SPEAR, a full service resource to help our community prepare for, respond to, and recover from any and all emergencies and disasters. From self-defense, martial arts and kickboxing to CPR, First Aid, basic &amp; advanced firearms training and safety &amp; security training, our staff provides common sense, easy to follow instruction that you can understand and apply to your everyday lives. We are committed to increasing your level of training and our new facilities are designed to accommodate you and your family.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community's safety and security is our passion. Our core group of emergency response and military professionals have over 50 years of collective experience to provide you with high quality, World Class training. Many of us have been directly involved in responding to terrorism, major severe weather emergencies, public health emergencies and wildfires. One issue was glaringly evident in each of these responses.....we, as human beings, are grossly under prepared for any emergency. SPEAR is designed to provide stress-free, friendly and family oriented facilities for training, education, equipment and resources to meet the world's safety &amp; security challenges. SPEAR - for everything Safety, Preparedness, Education And Recreation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SPEAR will be located on an approximately 10-acre campus in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Two buildings are included in the current architectural and business plans; however the campus is large enough for future expansion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One building will house our 2,500 square foot self-defense, martial arts and kick boxing facility. This space will allow us to continue to provide our world class Martial Arts training to our current members as well as welcome additional enrollments. We will expand our services to offer after school programs, which will be a balance of leadership, structure and exercise. SPEAR will pick your children up from school and bring them back to our facility where they will start on homework and enjoy a nutritious snack before they complete their martial arts or self-defense training. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>SPEAR's second building, with over 15,000 square feet, will allow us to offer expanded classrooms and retail space. This space will allows us to expand our selection of firearms, ammunition, camping gear and accessories. A lounge, available for parties and private events, will be modeled after a mountain lodge with large windows facing our ponds. This space will be open to all patrons, unless reserved for a private event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our state of the art indoor firing range will include 10 suites with a distance of 25 yards. The suites will be self-contained and will alleviate the nosy neighbor so you can concentrate on your training and skill development. Have more than 2 people? Our suites have doors to adjoining suites so you can feel like you're all together. And, as we want to provide a safe and secure training facility, a firearms instructor will never be more than 15 feet away to answer all your questions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we currently serve numerous Law Enforcement Agencies, our expansion would include them as well. Through the addition of a force on force Shoot House, using paint tipped, simulated rounds, this training area utilizes duty weapons and tactics and allows each participant to ""train as they fight."" This practical learning environment can help operators recognize threats on the fly and make decisions under fire. No other training like this is offered in our area. If we receive enough of a demand for the shoot house, it will be offered. If not, we can make this convertible space into an indoor archery range. So, either way, it's an added resource to our facility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In keeping with the ""train as you fight"" mentality, on the property surrounding our ponds, we will be offering an area for hunters to sight in their bows.....from a tree stand. Nothing gets you ready for hunting season like an area modeled after your hunting grounds. And, if you like the tree stand you train in, it's for sale in our store.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As many of SPEAR's staff are Veterans, our dedication to their service and sacrifice remains the driving force of our Mission. Too many of our Veterans have paid the ultimate sacrifice, whether it was in a conflict abroad or when they return to their home soil, and we want to support them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As mentioned before, there are two ponds on property and we will be improving them with natural landscaping and a wheelchair accessible trail around the shoreline.  Whether disabled visibly or not, the return to normalcy is paramount to the health of our Veterans. Fishing, walking, running or rolling is welcome, and greatly encouraged at our facility. After all, these ponds and the natural space surrounding our property is needed green space in our local community, and we are proud to be able to give back. We will also be offering Community Garden space. If you've always wanted to grow your own vegetable garden, but your neighborhood won't allow it, we encourage you to come stake your own plot.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get---</strong></h2>
<p>SPEAR, as an entire project, requires $2 million. This includes acquiring the property, re-zoning, site work, construction, upgrading the pond shoreline and installing the walking trails, operating expenses and increased inventory. When you think of everything we're going to achieve on this property, this is a small price to pay. Could we go bigger? Of course....but it wouldn't allow us to offer our products and services at the value pricing we offer now. However, the campus is large enough for future expansion.</p>
<p>We plan on using the funds as we progress in the project. The first $25,000 will secure our property. The next goal is approximately $500,000 which would be a down payment on a conventional loan. If we were to raise $1 million, that would be a larger down payment to lower our interest rate on a conventional loan. And, if we raise the entire amount of $2 million through IndieGogo, we wouldn't need a conventional loan.....which means the savings gets passed on to you, our community neighbor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happens if we don't raise our entire goal amount? SPEAR will still be built. It may be delayed by no more than 5 months, but it will be completed in 2018. And the funds you have backed us with will still be utilized for our project.....and the perks will still be honored. So, there's no losing by backing us now. If you've been a customer of ours since our inception, you know how passionate we are about our Mission......and you know this will become reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're interested in backing our project, you can help by purchasing one of our perks. You'll notice how unique they are. From perks we can deliver upon right now to memberships you can pre-buy now at special discounts, we have something for everyone to be able to help us on this Mission. If you purchase the Second Amendment Supporter or Toast to Freedom perks, you get a double perk. Get your t-shirt or stainless drinking mug now and then, when we open, wear or and bring it to SPEAR for 25% off lane and firearm rentals!!!! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These prices, for those who purchase through this IndieGogo campaign, remain your pricing for the life of your membership. They WILL NOT increase. As long as you stay current (for individual, family and corporate memberships), the price you pay today is the price you'll always pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We sincerely thank you for your support and we look forward to working with you in the future. You can continue to help us by sharing this campaign and sending it to your friends and family. </p>

""The Scratching Post Cat Cafe not only will we be able to enrich its visitor's life with the company of sweet, cuddly cats that are adoptable... The Cafe is also planning on having some of the freshest food and coffee in Wilmington. ""I am hoping to have a variety of vegetarian/vegan options as well as some fun dishes! Options for everyone!  We are also partnering up with a local coffee shop back home in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, bringing you the best, boldest, most delicious coffee the highlands of Guatemala has to offer! The BEST part of this whole endeavor is that my cafe will help find shelter cats a new home, and that just makes me so happy!""</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><u><i>What We Need:</i></u></h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>The funds we are asking for will go to the inicial startup costs of the cafe. These costs include: rent, kitty adoption fees, construction of the cat lounge and remodel of the building we find. </li>
<li>We also need to purchase a Food truck/or a container to be separate from the cat living area/oasis to abide to county health regulations! These range from $8-15,000. We are just waiting on the funds to locate the right one.</li>

<h3><i><u>What Do you get for helping?</u></i></h3>
<p>Thank you so much for helping us out! We have a few ""Perks"" available for those that want to see The Scratching Post Cat Cafe Succeed! </p>

<h3><i><u>The Impact</u></i></h3>
<p>The Scratching Post Cat Cafe will not only be a great place for humans to visit, it will be a safe haven for the cats living there! We will be taking in all cats, mostly older shelter cats that usually are overlooked in the adoption process.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Taking in 15+ cats will free up space for other furry friends at the shelters. </li>
<li>Exposing the kitties to the public will give them better chances of being adopted.</li>
<li>Giving the people of Wilmington a fun, new experience!</li>

""The Scratching Post Cat Cafe not only will we be able to enrich its visitor's life with the company of sweet, cuddly cats that are adoptable... The Cafe is also planning on having some of the freshest food and coffee in Wilmington. ""I am hoping to have a variety of vegetarian/vegan options as well as some fun dishes! Options for everyone!  We are also partnering up with a local coffee shop back home in Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, bringing you the best, boldest, most delicious coffee the highlands of Guatemala has to offer! The BEST part of this whole endeavor is that my cafe will help find shelter cats a new home, and that just makes me so happy!""

 
What We Need:


The funds we are asking for will go to the inicial startup costs of the cafe. These costs include: rent, kitty adoption fees, construction of the cat lounge and remodel of the building we find. 
We also need to purchase a Food truck/or a container to be separate from the cat living area/oasis to abide to county health regulations! These range from $8-15,000. We are just waiting on the funds to locate the right one.


What Do you get for helping?
Thank you so much for helping us out! We have a few ""Perks"" available for those that want to see The Scratching Post Cat Cafe Succeed! 

The Impact
The Scratching Post Cat Cafe will not only be a great place for humans to visit, it will be a safe haven for the cats living there! We will be taking in all cats, mostly older shelter cats that usually are overlooked in the adoption process.  

Taking in 15+ cats will free up space for other furry friends at the shelters. 
Exposing the kitties to the public will give them better chances of being adopted.
Giving the people of Wilmington a fun, new experience!


Risks & Challenges:
The cat café business model is new to our community so we are creating our very own blueprint! Your support paves the way for our success.
We will announce an opening date as we get further along in the project. Stay tuned to our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/TheScratchingPostCatCafe on  our website at https://wilmingtoncatcafe.wixsite.com/thescratchingpost  
and follow us on Instagram! 
We want you to have a catastic experience so we're working diligently to put together a purr-fect place. Many of you have expressed an interest in being part of our team and we're looking forward to meeting you.
We are very dedicated to this project. A successful Indiegogo will move us along quicker and bring our feline friends to us sooner. We're thankful to live in a community that loves and supports animals, and look forward to a successful and fun project!
Thank you, thank you! ❤️ Delia

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jennifer Hardaway and I am looking to raise money to help my business, KleanSpa, advance to the next level. We have been makers of scrumptious bath and body products and perfumes since 2005. However, KleanSpa is growing! We are excited to announce the launch of Phoebe Peacock. We have already launched the perfumery line Phoebe Peacock Parfums <a href=""https://www.phoebepeacockparfums.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>! The quick synopsis on Phoebe. Two years ago, I came across my Grandmother's death certificate. I saw that her mother (my Great Grandmother) was named Phoebe Peacock. Chills instantly came over me and I knew I was destined to create a beautiful lifestyle brand around her name. The perfumery line is the culmination of my recent study of perfumery and the first product of Phoebe Peacock.</p>
<p>Some of you may ask, why would you leave that marriage made-in-heaven with MINDFULnest? One answer. More space! We currently run our entire business out of 300 square feet. And we are GROWING! And we have used every inch of that space!</p>
<p>SO, about two months ago, I was put on alert that a space across the street was opening up. The time has come for us to claim that space!</p>
<p><strong>Here's where you come in!</strong></p>
<p>While we have some of the cash to get started, (I cashed out a Roth Ira early and moved over some saved profits) we are going to need a bunch more bucks. We are asking for your help to get there! Our goal is to build out a beautiful space that our customers and neighborhood can enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Here's what we need!</strong></p>
<p>Here's a brief list of the things that need to happen once we take over the storefront.</p>
<p><i>(Did we mention the new space is 998 sq. ft. That's almost 1000 sq. ft.!):</i></p>
<ol>
<li>Take out the drop ceiling $350</li>
<li>No need to pay for the main painting, the landlord covers that. Yay! $FREE!</li>
<li>Electrical &amp; Plumbing (for sink to wash dishes). Drywall for covering the drop ceiling removal. Installing extra plugs, installation of overhead lightening, pendants, tracks, adding extra juice to the electrical panel etc... $4000</li>
<li>Purchase lighting. The shop needs lots of it! Track and pendants $2000</li>
<li>Building of fixtures. One for our perfume line Phoebe Peacock. A cabinet that matches an existing trio of shelves that we used in the MINDFULnest scent bar in Santa Monica. Tops for those bars. A hard or pony wall. $3000</li>
<li>Handy man who can install, hang, paint detailed painting when needed. $1000</li>
<li>Purchase shelving and fixtures. Est. $2000</li>
<li>Order components to stock new shelves with delicious KleanSpa products! $2000</li>
<li>Inventory to get us started with the home items, jewelry, cards etc...for The Phoebe Peacock side. $4000</li>
<li>Things we haven't even thought of! $?? $1000?</li>
</ol>
<p>TOTAL: $19,350 (with some extra for the Indiegogo percentage 8%)</p>
<p><strong>Here's what you get!</strong></p>
<p>Perks, perks, perks! Depending on the level of donation (lending? Pre-sales?) you get certain KleanSpa products or services. For example:</p>
<ol><li>Want just a little something...</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">For $35 buckaroos, you will receive a Taste of KleanSpa gift set...(Don't eat it).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">A small body polish, small body butter and a small scent mist in one of our over 15 scents...(we have scents for men too!)</p>
<ol><li value=""2"">OR, want to get a BIG perk?</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">$750</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Imagine creating your own scent...but not only that. YOUR bespoke scent will be added to the KleanSpa menu for at least Three Months!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Together, you and Jennifer will design your custom scent, either virtually (if you are not in Los Angeles) or in person. You will then name your scent and we will add it to our KleanSpa scent offerings for a minimum of three months. You can tell all your friends that you have a signature scent at KleanSpa! Ooh la la!</p>
<p>There are these perks and everything in between! All the perks will be given in the form of a Gift Certificate to our shop or website. That way you can choose the scents you would like!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will still be able to use the cashola!</p>
<p>Anything will help us, but getting as close to our goal is important so we can get the space together as quickly as possible!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact you will have on our project!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One of our many goals is to continue to show the community how scent impacts our lives and how a beautiful space can add to our quality of life. And, now that we have more space, we can accommodate loads more people for blending bashes, classes, shopping…</li>
<li>Your support will help us get the word out about us and lift us up to the next level. Plus, if you are one who lives in the community, you will be able to take advantage of our cool space!</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><strong>What our potential challenges may be?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""><i>What if customers don’t come in the door on the other side of the street?</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Here’s the thing. We have been in business for 12 ½ years. We already have an established customer base. MINDFULnest will send them over, PLUS, we are next door to Audrey K, who is busy!</p>
<ul><li><strong>What CAN you do if you can’t help monetarily?</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Please help us get the word out. You never know who might be willing to help, even if they don’t know us! We need you to help spread the word. And don’t forget to use the Indiegogo share tools for Facebook etc…</p>

<p>If you’ve gotten to the end of this, congratulations! And thank you. We are excited and nervous about this next move and could not do it without you!</p>

<h3>This isn't just about teaching tumbling, sport acro or sports training, it's about helping the youth in our community believe in themselves, go for their dreams and become responsible individuals.</h3>
<p>We (John and Jill Greenidge) started JG Tumbling in September 2016.  We wanted to venture out on our own to provide athletes in our community with John's unique style of coaching.  We were led to a gymnastics facility where we currently rent from and work out of.  We began with just 2 classes and by January 2017 we started the year off with 11 classes.   We have not done any advertising.  This has all been done by word of mouth and social media.  Only 1 of our classes is during prime time.  All other classes are ""off"" hours.  We have wait lists for most of our classes and now even for private lessons.  With the time constraints, we have outgrown our current facility.  We have put in an offer to rent a building with an option to purchase in 2 years.  But now we need your help!  Our vision for our complex is built off the many aspects of tumbling; sport acro, acro dance, sport martial arts, cheerleading, parkour as well as functional training for sports; football, baseball, basketball, soccer, etc.  Our current client base is mainly children ages two to college.  We would be able to expand to adult classes and trainings which would make it a family complex.  By raising the $125,000 we will be able to provide our community and surrounding areas with many options for families to stay physically active in a safe environment with top-notch coaching, physically and mentally.  We need our community to get involved!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Funds Will Be Allocated</h3>
<p>Funds raised will go towards the down payment, first 2 months rent, build-out, gym equipment (ex. trampoline, spring floor, tumble track, various mats), furniture for parent viewing area, office furniture, security system with cameras, sound system, and other necessities to start a business (ex. cleaning supplies, vacuum, toilet paper, hand soap, etc.).  We have put into the equation the percentage Indiegogo charges for the funds raised for our campaign.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have had the opportunity to impact the lives of children and even parents on a small scale.  We would like to do so on a larger scale.  By building up the youth in our community. along with parental support, we will assist children in becoming well-rounded adults who can then impact the lives of others.  All of our athletes, whether age 2 or 20, first learn to ""Always Believe in Yourself"".  This is one of our core values.  We build athlete's confidence off of this very foundation; Belief!  It's amazing what you can get out of a child's performance once they believe in themselves! </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>There are always risks and challenges when expanding into a larger location; the build-out can cost more than expected, the build-out can run behind schedule, delivery of equipment can take longer than anticipated, hiring and training staff that is a good fit, etc.  </p>
<p>We are extremely blessed to have a number of people in our lives that can guide us through this process.  They have been there, done that.  Having people to reach out to during a time of need can be essential.  It gives us comfort knowing we have those people to turn to.</p>
<p>John has extensive experience in acrobatic gymnastics, tumbling, apparatus gymnastics, cheerleading, martial arts and personal training.  His 30+ years of working with children will definitely help us as he teaches classes, we hire coaches and communicate with parents.</p>
<p>Jill has extensive experience in customer service.  Her family has owned a couple of businesses.  She has learned the many ins and outs of business; payroll, accounting, hiring and firing staff, scheduling, customer relations, managing staff, supply orders and advertising. </p>
<p>We believe our combined skills, along with the proven skills of others, will only lead to success with our business.</p>

It is operated by Buffalo natives Carrie Nader and Alex Wadsworth. With our combined construction, finance, intensive farming and culinary skills we are confidant in our abilities to run a successful market garden. By using the best of traditional and modern farming technique, and operating with an entrepreneurial approach, we hope to inspire and encourage a new generation of would-be agriculturists.</p><p>Most farms are beyond the reach of the community that they serve. Farming in the heart of the city gives us an opportunity to show people who may have never visited a farm before a rare glimpse into where their food comes from.</p><p>We grow a variety of vegetables, herbs and fungi without the use of pesticides. We strive to be as sustainable as possible. Our farm is powered by 26 solar panels which power our walk in cooler, seed starting lights and the rest of our daily electric consumption. We use small human or electric powered tools for cultivation and harvest. We deliver goods with our hybrid vehicle. Being in close proximity to our markets gives our farm a unique edge.</p><h3><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h3><p>So far, we’ve imported 600 yards of new soil, built a storage shed, walk in cooler, a 350 sqft movable green house and our large 2000 sqft greenhouse.</p><p>We’ve provided our produce to local restaurants and grocery stores like Roost, Vera Pizza, Merge, Providence Social &amp; Lexington Coop. We sold at farmers markets throughout the city, including our own farm stand at the farm. We accept WIC and SNAP benefits at all of our markets.</p><h3><strong>Goals</strong></h3><p>This season we, not doubt, have our work cut out for us. We look forward to building a wash and pack station, mushroom fruiting chamber, two more movable greenhouses, and, with your help, filling our large greenhouse with new soil for our tomato plants.</p><h3><strong>What we need</strong></h3><p>We are asking for $5000 for fresh new soil in our 2000 sqft greenhouse. A portion of that will be used to rent the machinery to move the soil into place. Any extra funds will go directly into the farm for other necessary items.</p><h3> </h3><h2><strong>What can you do to help?</strong></h2><p>Share with your friends, family, co-workers… anyone!</p><p>Like us on <a href=""http://facebook.com/westsidetilthfarm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> and follow us in <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/westsidetilthfarm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.westsidetilth.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">westsidetilth.com</a></p></div>","Farming For The FutureWestSide Tilth Farm is an urban farm in Buffalo, NY.

By using the best of traditional and modern farming technique, and operating with an entrepreneurial approach, we hope to inspire and encourage a new generation of would-be agriculturists.Most farms are beyond the reach of the community that they serve. Farming in the heart of the city gives us an opportunity to show people who may have never visited a farm before a rare glimpse into where their food comes from.We grow a variety of vegetables, herbs and fungi without the use of pesticides. We strive to be as sustainable as possible. Our farm is powered by 26 solar panels which power our walk in cooler, seed starting lights and the rest of our daily electric consumption. We use small human or electric powered tools for cultivation and harvest. We deliver goods with our hybrid vehicle. Being in close proximity to our markets gives our farm a unique edge.AccomplishmentsSo far, we’ve imported 600 yards of new soil, built a storage shed, walk in cooler, a 350 sqft movable green house and our large 2000 sqft greenhouse.We’ve provided our produce to local restaurants and grocery stores like Roost, Vera Pizza, Merge, Providence Social & Lexington Coop. We sold at farmers markets throughout the city, including our own farm stand at the farm. We accept WIC and SNAP benefits at all of our markets.GoalsThis season we, not doubt, have our work cut out for us. We look forward to building a wash and pack station, mushroom fruiting chamber, two more movable greenhouses, and, with your help, filling our large greenhouse with new soil for our tomato plants.What we needWe are asking for $5000 for fresh new soil in our 2000 sqft greenhouse. A portion of that will be used to rent the machinery to move the soil into place. Any extra funds will go directly into the farm for other necessary items. What can you do to help?Share with your friends, family, co-workers… anyone!Like us on Facebook and follow us in Instagramwestsidetilth.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<br/>JukeShop</h3>
<p align=""left"">Hi,  since this fundraiser is primarily aimed at JukeShop friends and family, most folks reading this will already know me, but in case you've been referred here by a friend, let me introduce myself and our group:<br/>My name is Patrice Mackey aka Chef Juke.  I am an amateur chef but more importantly a longtime hobbyist and budding machinist. Over the last year and a half I've been working with a group of friends setting up a communal shop here in Eugene, Oregon...The JukeShop - a place where people could come and each contribute tools and expertise for communal benefit to allow all of us to be able to create both personal and communal projects that required more tools or knowledge than each of us had individually.     </p>

Background
Until the 1950s it was common for many people to make some or much of their world...furniture in our homes (sometimes the homes themselves) the clothes on our backs, the gifts we gave to to others, etc. Over the last half century, as our culture has embraced the benefits of technology and an ever-shrinking world, an unforeseen side effect is that people have become less and less in touch with the actual making and fixing of the things we use every day. We consume more and more and we make less and less. We have plenty of technical savvy, but have lost and are losing functional savvy. 
<p>This loss has not gone unnoticed and has spawned what is called the Maker Movement. A movement of people trying to recapture the skills to make things themselves rather than buying them off a shelf (or more accurately, buying them with a single click of the mouse) and gaining the satisfaction that comes with creating...whether for art, or function, or both.</p>
<p>Our goal for the JukeShop is to create a fully functioning wood/metal/foundry shop that allows us to have a place where we can gather to work on projects big or small....for example...my personal primary project is the JRC - Juke's Rocket Car...an art car that I want to build that evokes the Retro-Futuristic view of the 1930s:<br/>
</p>
<p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1360853/files/20150406180749-JukesMV.jpg?1428368869"" src="""" style=""width: 444px; height: 252px;""/><p></p>
<br/>
<p>Other JukeShop projects run from the Small (furniture, yard art) to the Not-so-small (treehouses, transforming a 1970's short bus into an RV/tailgaiting mobile, Jeep repair).</p><p>The main goal of this fundraiser is to encourage and enable this small group of wanna-be MAKERS to LEARN and MAKE and FIX and more.</p>

<p>Over the last year we've gathered a great starting set of tools that will enable us to weld, rivet, saw, cast metal and more...we've refurbished wonderful older tools including a vintage 1944 South Bend metal lathe, a 1944 Delta Milwaukee Drill press and assorted grinders and polishers, But now we're aiming to step it up to the next level.</p>
<p>To that end, we're looking for a little help from our friends to help us purchase a Vertical CNC Mill. This tool would enable us to make a multitude of parts for projects that are currently well out of our reach to either make manually with the tools that we have, or would not be cost effective to pay someone else to mill our parts for us.</p>
<p>Our goal machine is a Precision-Matthews PM-45-CNC Mill. This Vertical CNC Mill comes highly recommended and will do all of the kinds of milling we anticipate and more. It is hefty enough that it can mill what a larger mill can, but of a size that will still fit in our shop and can (relatively easily) be moved around in the shop when needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><img alt=""CNC"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1360889/files/20150406182807-PM-45M-CNC-VSFrontab.jpg?1428370087"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p>
<p>We already have over $2,000 dedicated to the CNC project but need more to be able to get a unit that would truly meet our needs and last for years of communal use and the tooling (vises, end mills, clamps, collets, etc.) to go with it to make it fully functional. </p>
<p>If we don't raise the full amount, we'll aim for a smaller CNC or a manual mill that we can later convert to CNC. If we raise more than the amount needed for the mill itself, we will invest the remainder in tooling for the mill.</p>
<h3>What YOU get</h3>
<p>Well, first and foremost you get the gratitude the whole JukeShop group....well that and the satisfaction of helping out a group of artists and creators better able to turn the visions of their creations into reality.</p>
<p>In terms of more concrete perks, we've come up with a few that we hope will be of interest:<br/>

<p>As I said, I am an amateur chef (studied Culinary Arts back in college) and have a particular interest in traditional Barbecue. I've put together some food related perks that I hope will attract some interest. The big one is basically a catered barbecue dinner for up to 8 folks...(sorry, Eugene area folks only). If you just want a little taste of my cooking, there's a jar of my World Famous (no, really...it's on Reddit, don'tcha know) Raspberry-Chipotle Barbecue Sauce. The $18 jar is for those who need it shipped to them, the $10 jar is for local folks.<br/><br/></p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1364660/files/20150407221315-CJ.jpg?1428469995"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><br/><p></p>

The car will feature our innovative XYO Mechanical Balancing Technology, which we believe will make it more powerful and energy efficient.Our hope is to advance the current sub-170MPH current record and we will run under the Modified Sports, Class H engine, FMS (unblown fuel) or GMS (unblown gas) category.History of the Jaguar D-Type Picture credit: Silodrome.comIn 1954 with limited resources Jaguar, an emerging sports car manufacturer, battled Mercedes (a Goliath at the time) and won the Le Mans 24-hour race in 1955, 1956 and 1957. The D-Type brought an innovative chassis and streamlined body, with a iconic tail plain for superior stability at high speeds; including never before introduced disc brakes. The D-Type brutalized the track with stability, control and sheer speed. It was the fastest car they had ever made, and coined the D-Type to be one of the worlds most respected, most valuable and sought after cars.Innovation: The Key To SuccessIn the spirit of innovation, we chose the Jaguar D-Type as an ideal platform to optimize the XYO Technology for the automotive industry. The vision is not just to set a world land speed record, but to prove the benefits of the XYO Technology for automotive applications. Over a billion cars are on the roads today, each one containing multiple rotating parts and components. Imbalance and vibration lead to inefficiencies and vehicles generate significant emissions that have a measurable impact on the environment. XYO could help make these vehicles much more energy efficient while enhancing performance. Our secret weapon is the XYO Mechanical Balancing Technology. Unlike conventional balancing methods, XYO can automatically and continuously balances rotating equipment to reduce vibration, ultimately making them more ENERGY EFFICIENT.




The XYO Technology has undergone decades of Research and Development to mature it into a commercially viable technology. Our Technical Site contains various videos and test reports showing several consumer, industrial and commercial applications where XYO has demonstrated significant benefits.

 We want to build the XYO Technology right into the car to help it reach its 200MPH goal. Specifically, we want to install XYO inside the car's DRIVESHAFT. XYO can improve balancing and allow much more efficient power transmission to the wheels. Lab testing indicates that by improving balance and reducing vibration in the driveshaft, we can significantly increase the performance of the car and help it reach its 200 MPH target.Speed Week | August 8-14, 2015 Every year, hundreds of teams show up at the 'Mecca of Racing' to try and set land speed records. Here are some facts about the event:
Event is run by the Southern-California Timing Association & Bonneville Nationals Inc.
Over 500 vehicle entries and 2,500 participants
Racing teams come from across the globe to participate at this famous site
Speed Week attracts over 12,000 spectators and 150 journalists
Why We Need Your HelpWe are a team of innovators and motoring enthusiasts. This project is not just about setting a land speed record; it's about DOING SOMETHING IMPACTFUL. The world has precious and limited resources, and burning fossil fuels is having tremendous environmental and health consequences. With over 80 million vehicles produced annually and a billion vehicles on the road today, we are trying to make them more fuel efficient without compromising performance.We believe the XYO Technology represents a major advancement for balancing rotating systems. It has the potential to minimize vibration to make vehicles significantly more energy efficient, and we want to showcase its abilities at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. Installing XYO on the driveshaft is only the first step. In the future we plan to implement XYO for use in vehicle engine fans, wheels and engines. Our ultimate vision is to push the limits for what it means for a car to be smooth, quiet, reliable and fuel efficient, while enhancing performance.Raising $20,000This is the minimum budget to get us to our goal. Funds raised will not only be used for building the car, but they will put towards integrating the XYO technology into the driveshaft. Specifically, the funds will cover costs associated with:
The Car Build
Event Entry
Team and Vehicle Transportation
Prototype Design, Fabrication and Testing of the XYO Technology in the Driveshaft.
Stretch GoalsIf we raise more than $20,000 we intend to apply the additional funds towards building the XYO Technology in the Wheels and making it even faster and more efficient. Backer Rewards

</h3>
<p>Italo's Gourmet is a unique brand of Italian foods with a unique mission. Founded by brothers Wayde and Mark Alfarone, with the idea in mind that business can be self serving and serve the greater good at the same time! Italo's Gourmet is named after our father, Italo Alfarone, who along with our mother Elaine, spent most of their lives giving and helping others. This example gave rise to the idea that business does not have to be selfish, in fact many businesses help the needy, and we think that's the way it should be! By helping fund Italo's Gourmet, you are funding our dream, and also helping feed America. That's the American dream!</p>
<p>Now let's move on to the BIG question. What's so special about these products? For one thing, Italo's Gourmet is <b>100% natural,</b> <b>no preservatives, there's no added sugar, it's gluten free, and GMO free.</b> The way we make our products in small batches allows us to keep our traditional way of cooking in tact, at every step! We use only farm fresh ingredients, nothing is ever frozen or dried (yuk), and the order of the steps, combined with our ingredients simply make a better product. The bottom line, in numerous blind taste tests, our sauce wins every time against the most expensive ""top shelf"" sauces! We just taste better.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p>This is what fresh ingredients look like when they get to us. We process (grate, juice, chop) all ingredients in house. Our sauces, salad dressings, and soups all use fresh ingredients!</p>

<h3>Some Fast Facts About Nutrition:</h3>
<div>Let's look at the ingredients in our sauces, soups, and salad dressing. Any nutritionist will tell you that your body requires quality food, and if you want to be productive and healthy, you must eat well. So, let's look at our options.</div>
<div>
<p>1. Eat cheap food that's bad for you (e.g. fast food or microwaveable dinners)</p>
<p>2. Eat expensive food that may or may not be good for you</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>3. Eat Italo's Gourmet and get the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>Here's how it works, almost all cheap food is bad for you because almost all cheap food is processed with bad things, or things that have no nutritional value. Or, you can eat expensive foods that may or may not be good for you, because many expensive foods are also high in fat, sugars, and other things that our bodies don't want too much of. However, Italo's pasta sauce for example contains things that are delicious AND very good for you, such as, farm fresh tomatoes (full of anti-oxidants and Lycopene), which the Mayo Clinic says may help people with astma, and help stave off cancer! Or, basil, which research at Purdue University says: can reduce inflamation and swelling, has anti-aging properties, and is rich in anti-oxidants. Garlic is proven to boost the immune system and even combat the common cold, it can lower blood pressure, reduce total cholesterol while increasing ""good"" cholesterol, (this combination is said to help prevent Alzheimer's disease), and a little known fact about garlic... It was the first known athletic performance enhancing drug used by Olympic athletes in ancient Greece! And let's not forget the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil, if you're not sure what they are, google it, you'll be amazed. Instead of listing every ingredient we use, let's just say, all of our ingredients are good for you, period. </p>

<h3>What We Need:</h3>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are currently expanding our production, and no longer want to rely on outside manufacturers, in the critical phase of our fledgling business. We need equipment, more warehouse space, and inventory. Our plan is to purchase a 100 gallon steam kettle to increase production, along with an automated label machine, and filling line. While most of the process is still hand made in small batches, an increase in production is necessary, and very important for the next phase of our business plan. $50,000 will purchase all the needed equipment, pay for additional warehouse space, and give us an additional 30 day supply of product while we wait to collect from our clients.</p>

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""> <h3>Our Challenges:</h3>
<p>The most challenging thing that we deal with at Italo's Gourmet is our small batch price point. In the food industry, until you reach very high volume, pricing will be a little higher than other products in your category. While some companies sell pasta sauce for $3.00 and $6.00 a jar (depending on size), we sell ours for $5.99 and $9.99, but that's okay. Here's why. We understand how to overcome the price objection, we do it with quality, and a little logic. You can feed your family of six fast food, for a cost of about $36.00 if you want, or, you can feed a family of six Italo's healthy, delicious sauce and pasta for $12.00, the choice is yours, but who would ever choose expensive bad over inexpensive good? As sauces go, ours, along with two pounds of pasta will serve six people for $2.00 a person, you could get cheap sauce and get that down to $1.00 per person but then you just have a bad tasting meal and look really cheap!</p>
<p>Italo's Gourmet uses only 100% natural farm to bottle produce, with no stops in between, and never preservatives. We have found that once our customers taste the difference they will never go back to mass produced, low quality foods if they can help it. We also understand that some people can't even afford to feed their families, that's why our business model is what it is, we want to help.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3> <p>We know that not everyone is in a position to give money, but that doesn't mean you can't help!

<p><b><span>What is Jadal </span><span>for Knowledge and Culture</span><span>? </span></b></p>
<p><span><span>Jadal is an initiative that offers an open space, where cultural activities and knowledge sharing fuse </span><span>to </span><span>evoke and</span><span> spread </span><span>new </span><span>societal values. The project aims at encouraging creativity, innovation and collective activities </span><span>that benefit</span><span>the communit</span><span>y</span><span>. It also creates a space for self-exploration, </span><span>questioning, </span><span>sharing skills and experiences, critical discussions, reflection and artistic expression. </span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The space is situated in one of the old houses in </span><span>Amman</span><span>, loved for its unique architecture, dating back to 1933, located on al </span><span>Kalha</span><span> stairs, connecting Downtown</span><span>, the busy</span><span> old</span><span> heart of </span><span>the city </span><span>and </span><span>Jabal </span><span>L’We</span><span>i</span><span>bde</span><span>h</span><span>, a neighbourhood </span><span>bursting </span><span>with </span><span>ambitious </span><span>start-</span><span>ups and </span><span>creative initiatives</span><span>. The house</span><span> was renovated by the initiator</span><span> of the </span><span>project, and his partners at that time, </span><span>between 2011 and 2012 to have a lovely yard, a reading area, a gallery and two classrooms. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>What does Jadal do?</b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Since its opening in 2012, Jadal for Knowledge and Culture has been hosting various discussions, lectures, exhibitions for debuting artists, concerts and jam sessions. It has also been a space for diffe</span><span>rent workshops and courses based on communal sharing of artistic/linguistic skills and knowledge (Arabic, </span><span>English, </span><span>Hebrew, Spanish, French, Italian </span><span>courses with a cultural d</span><span>imension; </span><span>Dabkeh</span><span>, Salsa, Yoga and Meditation, </span><span>Pencil Drawing, </span><span>Acting, Guitar, Mosaic workshops/courses</span><span> and others</span><span>)</span><span>. Some of </span><span>Jadal’s</span><span> activities are regular, such as the monthly International Dinner and the weekly Discussion Saloon, where a wide range of topics related to human</span><span>ity</span><span>, </span><span>science, </span><span>nature and society </span><span>are</span><span> discussed.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Thanks to t</span><span>he diversity</span><span> and the depth</span><span> of </span><span>its</span><span> content</span><span>,</span><span> Jadal has become a safe space for different people and communi</span><span>ties</span><span> such as students, urban refugees, expatriates, artists</span><span>, thinkers, activists etc</span><span>. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>How is Jadal running?</b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The cornerstone of the project </span><span>is seeking </span><span>to build </span><span>a horizontal management</span><span> model</span><span> and </span><span>to assure </span><span>financial independence</span><span>. The space has been </span><span>run</span><span> by a diverse community which</span><span> believ</span><span>es</span><span> that these features might contribute positively to questioning the current</span><span> hierarchical</span><span> world system and creating an alternative way of functioning.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Having that in mind, Jadal was started with an investment of 37000 USD that was collected by </span><span>the project initiator</span><span> from friends and individual supporters. </span><span>Since the space needed to return this cost and to sustain itself, </span><span>i</span><span>t has been decided to generate income through some of the activities, while keeping them accessible to as many people as possible. A</span><span>s</span><span> the project is</span><span> not for profit</span><span>, the monthly income is used to cover </span><span>its</span><span> running cost</span><span>, the maintenance and the investment cost. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Why </span><span>crowdfund </span><span>now</span><span>?</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>During the 3 years of its existence, Jadal for Knowledge and Culture managed to return around 50% o</span><span>f the investment cost and to have an impact on many peoples</span><span>’</span><span> lives that see a need for this project to continue and thrive. We are fully aware that to achieve this, Jadal needs to assure its sustainability by returning the rest of the investment cost</span><span> and lifting up the burden of constant financial insecurity</span><span>. That would allow us to direct all </span><span>our energy and time</span><span> towards developing more in-depth content, </span><span>upgrading the space, opening up for more youth initiatives, </span><span>focusing on new educational and cultural projects</span><span>, as well as </span><span>facing upcoming challenges. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>Why support Jadal?</b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Jadal has always been nurtured by people and </span><span>has </span><span>exist</span><span>ed</span><span> for them. We want sustainability without approaching funding mechanisms that might </span><span>compromise</span><span> the independence and freedom of the space and its con</span><span>tent.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>By supporting Jadal, you are contributing to the sustainability of a space that is committed to maintain its strength driven by diversity</span><span> and </span><span>to </span><span>assure</span><span> that </span><span>as many people as possible exercise their rights </span><span>to cultur</span><span>e, arts, education, as well as critical and free thought. </span><span>If you think that such social and cultural experiments are needed in this world, please contribute to sustaining Jadal for Knowledge and Culture by donating </span><span>and enjoying our rewards </span><span>or</span><span>/and</span><span> sharing this request with other people around you. </span></p>

What is Jadal for Knowledge and Culture? 
Jadal is an initiative that offers an open space, where cultural activities and knowledge sharing fuse to evoke and spread new societal values. The project aims at encouraging creativity, innovation and collective activities that benefitthe community. It also creates a space for self-exploration, questioning, sharing skills and experiences, critical discussions, reflection and artistic expression. 

The space is situated in one of the old houses in Amman, loved for its unique architecture, dating back to 1933, located on al Kalha stairs, connecting Downtown, the busy old heart of the city and Jabal L’Weibdeh, a neighbourhood bursting with ambitious start-ups and creative initiatives. The house was renovated by the initiator of the project, and his partners at that time, between 2011 and 2012 to have a lovely yard, a reading area, a gallery and two classrooms. 

What does Jadal do?

Since its opening in 2012, Jadal for Knowledge and Culture has been hosting various discussions, lectures, exhibitions for debuting artists, concerts and jam sessions. It has also been a space for different workshops and courses based on communal sharing of artistic/linguistic skills and knowledge (Arabic, English, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Italian courses with a cultural dimension; Dabkeh, Salsa, Yoga and Meditation, Pencil Drawing, Acting, Guitar, Mosaic workshops/courses and others). Some of Jadal’s activities are regular, such as the monthly International Dinner and the weekly Discussion Saloon, where a wide range of topics related to humanity, science, nature and society are discussed.

Thanks to the diversity and the depth of its content, Jadal has become a safe space for different people and communities such as students, urban refugees, expatriates, artists, thinkers, activists etc. 

How is Jadal running?

The cornerstone of the project is seeking to build a horizontal management model and to assure financial independence. The space has been run by a diverse community which believes that these features might contribute positively to questioning the current hierarchical world system and creating an alternative way of functioning.

Having that in mind, Jadal was started with an investment of 37000 USD that was collected by the project initiator from friends and individual supporters. Since the space needed to return this cost and to sustain itself, it has been decided to generate income through some of the activities, while keeping them accessible to as many people as possible. As the project is not for profit, the monthly income is used to cover its running cost, the maintenance and the investment cost. 

Why crowdfund now?

During the 3 years of its existence, Jadal for Knowledge and Culture managed to return around 50% of the investment cost and to have an impact on many peoples’ lives that see a need for this project to continue and thrive. We are fully aware that to achieve this, Jadal needs to assure its sustainability by returning the rest of the investment cost and lifting up the burden of constant financial insecurity. That would allow us to direct all our energy and time towards developing more in-depth content, upgrading the space, opening up for more youth initiatives, focusing on new educational and cultural projects, as well as facing upcoming challenges. 

Why support Jadal?

Jadal has always been nurtured by people and has existed for them. We want sustainability without approaching funding mechanisms that might compromise the independence and freedom of the space and its content.

By supporting Jadal, you are contributing to the sustainability of a space that is committed to maintain its strength driven by diversity and to assure that as many people as possible exercise their rights to culture, arts, education, as well as critical and free thought. If you think that such social and cultural experiments are needed in this world, please contribute to sustaining Jadal for Knowledge and Culture by donating and enjoying our rewards or/and sharing this request with other people around you. 

Thank you!


ما هو جدَل للمعرفة والثقافة؟
جدل هو مبادرة تقدّم مساحة تتفاعل فيها الأنشطة الثقافيّة والمعرفيّة، لصياغة ونشر قيم مجتمعيّة جديدة. يهدف المشروع إلى تشجيع الإبداع والابتكار والعمل الجماعي العام خدمةً للمجتمع، كما أنّه يوفّر مساحة لاكتشاف الذات والتساؤل، وتشارك المهارات والتجارب، والنقاشات النقديّة، والفكر والفن.
يقع جدَل على أحد أقدم أدراج عمّان، الكلحة، فيبيت يعود بناؤه إلى عام 1933. يصل جدَل بين قلب عمّان، وسط البلد، وجبل اللويبدة الذي يعج بالعديد من المشاريع الثقافيّة الطموحة والمبادرات الفنيّة. قام مؤسّس المشروع وشركاؤه في تلك المرحلة بترميم البيت، خلال عاميّ 2011-2012 ليجهزّوا فيه ساحة رحبة، وقاعة للقراءة، ومعرضاً فنيّاً، وقاعتين للدورات وورشات العمل.
بماذا يقوم جدَل؟
منذ افتتاحه فيالعام 2012، يستضيف جدَل للمعرفة والثقافة حوارات وندوات ومعارض لفنّانين شباب وأمسيات موسيقيّة وغيرها من الأنشطة. كما أصبح مساحةً لورشات ودورات متنوّعة، قائمة على مبدأ تشارك المهارات الفنيّة واللغويّة والمعرفة بشكل عام (العربيّة، الإنجليزيّة، العبريّة، الإسبانيّة، الفرنسيّة، الإيطاليّة ببعد ثقافي، وكذلك الدبكة، السالسا، اليوغا والتأمّل، الرسم بالرّصاص، التمثيل، الجيتار، الفسيفساء وغيرها). بعض أنشطة جدَل دوريّة، مثل فعاليّة ""أطعمة من العالم"" الشهريّة و""صالون جدل"" الأسبوعي الذي يتناول قضايا حول الإنسانيّة، والعلوم، والطبيعة، والمجتمع.
بفضل تنوّع وعمق المضمون، أصبح جدَل مكاناً آمناً لفئاتٍ مختلفة من المجتمع، كالطّلاب واللاجئين والفنانين والمفكرين والنشطاء.
كيف يعمل جدَل؟
يسعى المشروع إلى بناء نموذج إدارة جماعيّة أفقيّة، وإلى ضمان استقلاليّتة الماليّة. يقوم على المكان مجموعة من الأفراد من خلفيّاتٍ مختلفة، يُجمعون على أهميّة هذا النهج ودوره الإيجابي في نقد النّظام العالمي السائد، القائم على الهرميّة، ويسعون إلى بناء نموذج عمل بديل.
تأسّس جدَل بكلفة إجماليّة بلغت حوالي 37000  دولار، جمعها المؤسّس من أناس مختلفين. وبما أنّه كان على المشروع سداد هذه الكلفة وتغطية مصاريفه، فقد استند إلى أنشطته، مع الحرص على جعلها متاحة لأكبر شريحة ممكنه من الناس. ولأن المشروع لا يهدف للرّبح، فإن مدخوله الشهري يستخدم لتغطية مصاريفه وصيانة المكان وسداد كلفة تأسيسه.
لماذا نقوم بهذه الحملة؟
خلال سنوات عمله الثلاث، إستطاع جدَل للمعرفة والثقافة سداد حوالي نصف كلفة تأسيسه، وأن يؤثّر على حياة كثير من الناس المقتنعين بضرورة استمرار وتطوّر هذا المشروع. إنّنا ندرك تماماً بأن تحقيق ذلك يعتمد على ضمان استدامة جدَل من خلال سداد الجزء المتبقي من كلفة تأسيسه، والتّخلص من وطأة الضغط المادّي المستمر. وبذلك سنتمكّن من وضع طاقة ووقت أكبر لتطوير مساحة المشروع والمضمون الذي يقدّمه. كما سيكون بوسعنا أن نتيح مجالا أكبر للمبادرات الشابّة في جدل، وأن نعمل على مشاريع ثقافيّة ومعرفيّة، ونواجه التّحديات القادمة.
ما الفائدة من دعم جدَل؟
لطالما كان جدَل مساحةً للناس، يعتنون به ويطوّرونه ليعمل هو بدوره من أجلهم. إنّنا نسعى إلى الاستمراريّة والاستدامة، دون أن نتوجّه لآليّات الدعم التقليديّة التي قد تحدّ من إستقلاليّة وحريّة المشروع ومضمونه.
بدعمكم جدَل، تشاركون بتحقيق استمراريّة مساحة تعهّدت بالحفاظ على قوّتها المستمدّة من التنوّع، وبالعمل على إتاحة حريّة ممارسة الحق في الثقافة والفنون والتعليم والتفكير النقدي الحرّ لأكبر شريحة من الناس. إذا كنت تعتقد/ين بأن هذا النوع من التجارب الإجتماعيّة/الثقافيّة ضروري في عالمنا، نرجو منك دعم جدَل للمعرفة والثقافة بمبلغ ما، والاستمتاع بهدايانا التقديريّة أو/ومشاركة هذه الحملة مع محيطك.

Last year, we were shown a bigger space, 112 West King Street and have decided to move forward with expanding our lovely shop. The new space will be over double the amount of square footage which means more seating, more storage, bigger and easier bar to navigate around and a kitchen for me to bake in. <br/></p>

We also look forward to supporting our local economy by using local ingredients, and partnering with local farmers, businesses and other awesome people.Additionally, we plan to use environmental best practices whenever possible, including purchasing organic and sustainable ingredients, and donating a portion of our sales to environmental and social organizations. WHAT IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL?Even if we don't reach our funding goal, we will still be opening early 2019, just maybe with fewer tables, bar stools and some extra stress. :)Everyone told us to double our budget and double our timeline. And during the four years we have spent forming Fruition, we have. More than once.We were initially funded by our own savings and small loans from family and friends, which put us in a position to receive an SBA loan earlier this year. We are so grateful that we have made it this far as the exclusive owners of Fruition. However, construction costs have once again exceeded our expectations during this final stretch and the funds we raise in this campaign will go towards the interior design elements of the tasting room.The money we raise will primarily go towards comfortable bar stools, soundproofing, plants, light fixtures and paint. We are not looking for donations. We want people to feel well compensated for their contribution and we hope you enjoy the packages we've put together!We're incredibly excited to share what we've been working on with everyone, and appreciate your continued support in this final stretch.HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP?We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially to this campaign, however there are still ways you can help. Thanks for helping spread the word about Fruition and this campaign to your friends, family and neighbors on Facebook and Instagram!",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who am I ?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Martell Oliver. I am an educator, a curator, a movement, and visual artist. 3 years ago, with little capital and the backing of dedicated Philly artists, I started Philly Art Collective. It started as a means for artists like myself to showcase their work in a gallery setting, creating exhibition opportunities. Philly Art Collective is a staple in the art community solely from reciprocal support from artists. As a curator I’ve built relationships with over 200 artists in the city of Philadelphia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do I need ? </strong></p>
<p>I am looking for monetary support to fund the grand opening of Olo Solo Gallery West. A West Philly gallery which artists can host solo exhibitions and pop-up shops. Opening Olo Solo Gallery West will open a door for artists to take the next steps in becoming a living artist. Artists will be able to use Olo Solo Gallery West to highlight their craftsmanship and build a larger following.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Much / Where the Funds will Go?</strong></p>
<p>This campaign for <strong><i>$3,000</i></strong> will cover </p>
<p>-The initial moving-in expenses of preparing the new gallery space such as paint, lighting, exhibition systems, wall building, etc.  </p>
<p>- A portion of the rent for the 1st year after the move</p>
<p>- Insurance</p>
<p>- Utilities</p>
<p>- Advertising/Marketing</p>

<p><strong>The Heart of the Matter!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am honored to be able to create a space to house the artwork of the amazingly talented artists who have been part of my creative network for the last couple years. I am excited to bring their work to new audiences, to provide them an outlet to increase sales and to do so while respecting their artwork and work ethic.</p>

<h3>Our Lives In A Few Hundred Words</h3>
<p>Sebastian (a chef) and Melissa (not a chef) met in Miami at the tail end of 2008. Soon after (*~true love montage~*) they moved to Los Angeles together. In LA, they were surrounded by the absolute best in Mexican cuisine but couldn't find much by way of the flavors they grew up enjoying. So they did what any good 1st Generation USA-ians would do—they stole their families’ recipes and started making food. Empanadas to be exact. Everyone loved them, and that first batch of empanadas shared with co-workers snowballed into what everyone knows today as Buenas—a line of specialty goods which includes empanadas, sauces, and more.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few years and (skipping over key details like another cross-country move, supportive bosses, happenstance meetings that must’ve been written in the stars, incredible friends and support from the BEST food community ever) here we are, asking for your help to open our first retail location. It’s an itty bitty (but perfect) 166-square-feet and it's quite literally the biggest thing we’ve ever done, as individuals, or together for that matter. Your contribution will fund us through the rest of our build out journey. The store may be small, but we’ve run into some bigger-than-expected costs. This includes architect fees, contractor fees, labor that we can’t do with our own two hands—like plumbing, wouldn’t want Nini doing plumbing—the actual materials to build out the store (we’re keeping it simple), and some remaining equipment that we haven’t checked off our list.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We didn’t start Buenas to teach anyone about our culture, but it’s certainly shaping up to be a great way to do that. In our opinion, it’s more important than ever to show that the things that make us different are the things that bring us all closer together. Your support is about so much more than equipment and contractors—we’re on a mission to create a community around our food. We’re also on a mission to make food more simple, with go-to products that make it easier to cook at home. So you can spend more time creating communities of your own. It’s what we had growing up, and now, as adults, it’s something we realize we could all use more of.</p>
<p>Besides food, we’ll be using our space to prop up our fellow makers in Boston and beyond (shout out to Miami and LA). The space is small, but it’s part of the larger <a href=""http://www.bowmarketsomerville.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bow Market</a> family, so we’ll be hosting art, music and food events as often as possible. Life can be hard and annoying, so however we can make it less hard and annoying is what we’re after. And we couldn’t do it without you.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any other crowd funding campaign, we’re sure we’ll run into bumps along the road related to gathering printing estimates, ordering shirts/hats/fanny packs and shipping.

In a world where hate and segretation stand above love, respect and solidarity we seize even more for products that carry an important message out into the world – There is a better way of treating each other!
We from Kreativpiloten successfully market the original Viennese Ampelpärchen all over the world for two years now. It is our goal to send out our sweet little Couples, as ambassadors of love.

This way of thinking, this way of life aspired us to cooperate with the organizers of EuroPride 2019 in Vienna. In advance to this huge project we will launch some of our exclusive EuroPride 2019 Products this summer. To have the world ready for receiving our message of love, respect and diversity.
Help us to achieve this goal, to lift the good over the bad and to make the world a better place for everyone, regardless their sexuality, nationality, gender, religion or color of skin.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Get to know me </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Standing on a chair in the kitchen of my childhood home in Maine, watching my mum's deft hands spoon ingredients into bowls without even measuring, is where I learned to <i>love</i> to bake. However, it was over the years of baking banana bread with leftover bananas from morning group runs while working in PR, marketing and customer relationship management of a high-end running apparel startup in Boston, <strong>Tracksmith (also Hearth's first home!)</strong> -- feeding hungry post-run runners became my way of combining two things I love, running and baking; preparing elaborate multi course themed dinner parties to bring my diverse friend groups together; experimenting with new flavors and spices while studying abroad in Europe; and working as a pastry chef at a the best French restaurant in Boston, L’Espalier – that I really learned to bake. When I jumped head first into making my passion my career, I attended London Business School to earn my Master’s in Management while also training competitively to qualify for the Olympic Trials in the London Marathon. In tandem to working with my own nutritionist, I started adapting my family recipes to be more wholesome as fuel for my running — think less butter or oil, more fruit, vegetables and yogurt; less refined sugar, more natural sweeteners like honey and maple; less processed white flour, more whole grains which are easier to digest and nutritious; less fillers and more add-ins and topping which add to the dietary benefits such as omega-3 filled nuts, raw cacao, and quick energy fueling medjool dates.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now, I am a culinary entrepreneur at Commonwealth Kitchen, doing popups and catering, trying to bring Hearth Baking Co. to life and build my <strong>community through cake</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518796108/l8fludz8rxvhxxrs5fxs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hearth Baking Co., your local family</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In my family, food has always been a way of showing you care, bringing people together,  and making new friends. In my own life, I bake not only because it makes me happy to see people enjoying my food, but also because it was a way for me to make a new family for myself in Boston - bringing people I met together from all aspects of my life to create a community. Hearth Baking Co. is not just a bakery, it will be a <strong>community space</strong>: supporting local producers, a place to gather and work, group events/workshops/discussions/cookbook club, and so much more. With recipes passed down through generations, ingredients sourced from our neighbors, and a space designed to foster interaction, Hearth connects community through cake.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hearth Baking Co. will be my second home, where I know everyone's name (and their favorite baked good!). A place where people can gather as a small community within big Boston.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Like in my childhood home, a traditional method of heating in New England is by fire in a hearth. Warm, comforting, emitting a nostalgic scent of burning wood, this is historically where cooking took place and where communities and families gathered on cold days. So please help me give Hearth a home, because <strong>Hearth makes a home</strong> - and hopefully it will be yours too.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516226668/r2x1awb8g7c01cqplyws.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The good stuff</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hearth Baking Co. has an eclectic menu combining my time-tested <strong>family recipes</strong> with exciting <strong>flavors and spices</strong> I learned while traveling abroad and the ingredients of a modern, international pantry for creative and unique flavors. Think my grandmother's Great Depression apple cake with a cardamom-espresso streusel topping; whole wheat Maine blueberry pancake muffins sweetened completely with Maine maple syrup and blueberries, and the infamous Everything Bagel Cream Cheese Stuffed Scone. And that's just getting started.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Using local ingredients such as Maine Grains (in a little town where I grew up camping) whole grain heirloom flours milled within 3 days of being baked, Maine sourced maple syrup from my hometown, sustainably sourced B-grade surplus produce from around New England that would otherwise be thrown away because it was “ugly,” organic and ethically sourced natural ingredients such as eggs, chocolate, and honey.  The flavors combinations range from creative to quirky.  And the result, wholesome, tasty baked goods — Which are currently fueling my Boston Marathon training!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The items of the cafe will rotate based on what's <strong>in season</strong>, and with your help will expand to include a full all-day menu with artisan porridges, toasts (with homemade nut butter), seasonal soups and plates, and sourdough bread. And of course, coffee. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516226637/pbuw5cbxxzgmaz6jdgwl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul style=""text-align: center;""></ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">You put the heart in Hearth </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hearth Baking Co. is a big dream, but every penny will be spent in acquiring a space (rent in Boston can get up there!), building it out to be the best neighborhood hangout around (including an open kitchen so you can see the food being prepared and I can chat with you while I bake!) , sourcing local high-quality ingredients from our talented community - basically on everything that will matter to you as a member of the Hearth Baking Co. family.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518795964/av2d6iwn6aurz58l1jja.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">No risk, all reward</h3>

Get to know me 
Standing on a chair in the kitchen of my childhood home in Maine, watching my mum's deft hands spoon ingredients into bowls without even measuring, is where I learned to love to bake. However, it was over the years of baking banana bread with leftover bananas from morning group runs while working in PR, marketing and customer relationship management of a high-end running apparel startup in Boston, Tracksmith (also Hearth's first home!) -- feeding hungry post-run runners became my way of combining two things I love, running and baking; preparing elaborate multi course themed dinner parties to bring my diverse friend groups together; experimenting with new flavors and spices while studying abroad in Europe; and working as a pastry chef at a the best French restaurant in Boston, L’Espalier – that I really learned to bake. When I jumped head first into making my passion my career, I attended London Business School to earn my Master’s in Management while also training competitively to qualify for the Olympic Trials in the London Marathon. In tandem to working with my own nutritionist, I started adapting my family recipes to be more wholesome as fuel for my running — think less butter or oil, more fruit, vegetables and yogurt; less refined sugar, more natural sweeteners like honey and maple; less processed white flour, more whole grains which are easier to digest and nutritious; less fillers and more add-ins and topping which add to the dietary benefits such as omega-3 filled nuts, raw cacao, and quick energy fueling medjool dates.
Now, I am a culinary entrepreneur at Commonwealth Kitchen, doing popups and catering, trying to bring Hearth Baking Co. to life and build my community through cake.

Hearth Baking Co., your local family
In my family, food has always been a way of showing you care, bringing people together,  and making new friends. In my own life, I bake not only because it makes me happy to see people enjoying my food, but also because it was a way for me to make a new family for myself in Boston - bringing people I met together from all aspects of my life to create a community. Hearth Baking Co. is not just a bakery, it will be a community space: supporting local producers, a place to gather and work, group events/workshops/discussions/cookbook club, and so much more. With recipes passed down through generations, ingredients sourced from our neighbors, and a space designed to foster interaction, Hearth connects community through cake.
Hearth Baking Co. will be my second home, where I know everyone's name (and their favorite baked good!). A place where people can gather as a small community within big Boston.
Like in my childhood home, a traditional method of heating in New England is by fire in a hearth. Warm, comforting, emitting a nostalgic scent of burning wood, this is historically where cooking took place and where communities and families gathered on cold days. So please help me give Hearth a home, because Hearth makes a home - and hopefully it will be yours too.


The good stuff
Hearth Baking Co. has an eclectic menu combining my time-tested family recipes with exciting flavors and spices I learned while traveling abroad and the ingredients of a modern, international pantry for creative and unique flavors. Think my grandmother's Great Depression apple cake with a cardamom-espresso streusel topping; whole wheat Maine blueberry pancake muffins sweetened completely with Maine maple syrup and blueberries, and the infamous Everything Bagel Cream Cheese Stuffed Scone. And that's just getting started.
Using local ingredients such as Maine Grains (in a little town where I grew up camping) whole grain heirloom flours milled within 3 days of being baked, Maine sourced maple syrup from my hometown, sustainably sourced B-grade surplus produce from around New England that would otherwise be thrown away because it was “ugly,” organic and ethically sourced natural ingredients such as eggs, chocolate, and honey.  The flavors combinations range from creative to quirky.  And the result, wholesome, tasty baked goods — Which are currently fueling my Boston Marathon training!
The items of the cafe will rotate based on what's in season, and with your help will expand to include a full all-day menu with artisan porridges, toasts (with homemade nut butter), seasonal soups and plates, and sourdough bread. And of course, coffee. 



You put the heart in Hearth 
Hearth Baking Co. is a big dream, but every penny will be spent in acquiring a space (rent in Boston can get up there!), building it out to be the best neighborhood hangout around (including an open kitchen so you can see the food being prepared and I can chat with you while I bake!) , sourcing local high-quality ingredients from our talented community - basically on everything that will matter to you as a member of the Hearth Baking Co. family.

No risk, all reward
In return for you generosity, everyone who donates within New England will get a freshly baked and delivered loaf of my famous whole grain double roasted banana bread (or, the baked good of your choosing). In addition, you will be on the guest list for my soft launch opening, an intimate gathering just for you, the people who make this happen, a celebration of you! For those further afoot, I will make a custom travel-safe care package just for you!

Other Ways You Can Help
Of course I understand that everyone may not be able to donate, however you can still be part of the Hearth Baking Co. community by helping to spread the love (of cake) and share the link.
Also, you can visit me at Tracksmith, 285 Newbury Street, at my popup bakery to try things for yourself, a guarantee on your investment.
I am grateful for you no matter what.

<p>Being a volume based business, we couldn't risk the health of our employees, friends and community and had to close our doors on March 16th for an indefinite amount of time.

With no revenue and bills piling up, we are in the process of exploring all possible avenues to keep our fun, loving, inclusive and wholesome neighborhood spot alive and kicking in the new world! </p>
<p>We are keeping busy on improving the Mallo experience by further refining and building out our space. We figured, best thing to do is to work on ourselves so that we stand a better chance at continuing to create stories and connections in the coming future!</p>
<p>The funds generated will go to support the various costs associated with closing shop indefinitely(rent, hydro,insurance(i know right?), other services, spoilage, restocking, etc...) and supplementary financial support for staff. </p>
