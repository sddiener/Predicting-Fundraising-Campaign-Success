</p><p><span>We are a group of four
students from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville that are working together
to support a local cause. Our team includes Alec North, Briana </span><span>Sproles</span><span>,
Cannon West, and Rebecca Pirkle. We have decided to support East Tennessee
Children's Hospital (ETCH) because, as Knoxville residents, the hospital is
close to home and has deep roots in our community. Their dedication to seeing
children reach optimal health is evident, and because of that, we are striving
to help ETCH reach their goals. </span></p>
<p><span>Since 1937, ETCH has
been a leader in children's health in East Tennessee-providing excellent,
comprehensive family-centered care, education and wellness. It is a private,
independent non-profit organization that does not discriminate based on race,
religion, or the parent's ability to pay for their child's medical bill. ETCH
shows their love for the well-being of children by putting together countless
events, including summer camps, that cost little to nothing at all for their
patients who want to attend. </span></p>
<p><span>Every year, ETCH
organizes a camp called the Donald M. </span><span>Gally</span><span>
summer camp for children with special needs. It is held at the Kiwanis Fresh
Air Camp in Knoxville for two weeks each July.  Children ages 5 through 15
years have a wide range of complex special needs and serious physical,
emotional, and learning limitations. Because so much is involved with the operation
of the camp and the camp costs very little for each child who attends, much of
the funding for the camp comes from donations and fundraising to remain
functioning every year. </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1345325/files/20150401045024-camp_gally_1.jpg?1427889024"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b><span>What We Need </span></b></p>
<p><span>The Donald M. </span><span>Gally</span><span>
summer camp is fully funded by donations. Along with Rehab Center physical
therapists and registered nurses, camp staff includes an adaptive physical
education teacher, three activity assistants and volunteers to work with 25
children each week. The cost is $390 per child. We are trying to raise a total
of $1600 in order to pay for 4 children to attend camp this summer free of cost. A large portion of the camp's funding comes in one of the most

<p><b><span>Who It Helps</span></b></p>
<p><span>Donations to ETCH will
not only help further the progress of the hospital's vision for their patients,

142,000 children taken care of every year, further outside funding to help with

<p><span>For many of the special

have the opportunity to be involved in a number of activities including:

there is a real building with great attributes that's ideal for this THC-inspired vision—<b>for
sale.</b> While I believe I could make a Temple out of almost any location, this building could truly be the perfect permanent headquarters of New Jersey's Cannabis-Consuming Community, POLITICAL Headquarters of ""unfunded"" GrassRoots Activist.  I’d like to ask my supporters and
the Cannabis-Consuming Citizens of America to help me achieve this vision, which we would all reap the rewards of—to help
me reopen the LIBERTY BELL TEMPLE in TRENTON, NJ, to all comers through the acquisition of this building. I think i put me dues in. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Situated in South Trenton in a commercial/residential zone, the two-story building is adjacent a existing
Christian churches and a major bank, It's 1,200 square feet of space per floor plus an enclosed backyard. The first floor is currently set up as a nightclub with a bar and booths and a pool table, and the building comes with an existing liquor license, which would be a bonus to have for fund-raising purposes, social events, and private
gatherings. <b>Total price: $249,000 to purchase the entire building.</b> The landlord is willing
to hold the mortgage and transfer the city liquor license for one-third down
($70,000), followed by monthly payments of $2,000. Like other religious institutions, this TEMPLE would generate a substantial monthly income through membership fees, donations, and special events. <br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><u><b>#2 Choice</b></u> - I've also located a storefront at 322 East State Street, This location has a commercial kitchen in it. This kitchen would generate a income for myself as well as money to operate the temple (SANCTUARY ROOM), and to fund cannabis legalization projects #legalizenj here in New Jersey.   If this is the start of a great Temple in a storefront - so be it.

they feel like coming through). Special events would include chess nights, Karaoke days, fish fry's, political bull sessions, and religious-reasoning sessions. The sky's the limit on what we can do. ""LETS GET HIGH"" <br/></p>

(http://tinyurl.com/LBT2-enjoiner). This was the first successful court-approved cannabis church ever.

DISASTER STRIKES: On December 13, 2011, (http://tinyurl.com/LADEA-RAID) DEA agents raided the Liberty Bell Temple II plus the TEMPLE's Lounge and grow
facilities as well as my home. They seized everything and rendered the TEMPLE insolvent. On February 6th
the TEMPLE Closed. (https://youtu.be/6kGUJl1hBcs)


NEW VISION: To transfer the Religious Incorporation from California, to New Jersey asap. After all my years of fighting the good fight, challenging laws and establishing precedents, and in light of the current state of the marijuana laws, I believe the time is right to reopen: In Trenton, NJ. It's high time for a rebirth.
WHO WOULD COME: Thousands would become members, dozens would attend daily. Instead of going to traditional churches, bars, bowling alleys, and other uncomfortable places to socialize with Cannabis Consumers, I would like you to flock to TRENTON to be the congregation of the new LIBERTY BELL TEMPLE.

CURRENT SITUATION: #1 Choice - A suitable building has been found—but I have no cash to acquire it.      ( SEE VIDEO ABOVE) A storefront location in a neighborhood could suffice, but right now
there is a real building with great attributes that's ideal for this THC-inspired vision—for
sale. While I believe I could make a Temple out of almost any location, this building could truly be the perfect permanent headquarters of New Jersey's Cannabis-Consuming Community, POLITICAL Headquarters of ""unfunded"" GrassRoots Activist.  I’d like to ask my supporters and
the Cannabis-Consuming Citizens of America to help me achieve this vision, which we would all reap the rewards of—to help
me reopen the LIBERTY BELL TEMPLE in TRENTON, NJ, to all comers through the acquisition of this building. I think i put me dues in. 
Situated in South Trenton in a commercial/residential zone, the two-story building is adjacent a existing
Christian churches and a major bank, It's 1,200 square feet of space per floor plus an enclosed backyard. The first floor is currently set up as a nightclub with a bar and booths and a pool table, and the building comes with an existing liquor license, which would be a bonus to have for fund-raising purposes, social events, and private
gatherings. Total price: $249,000 to purchase the entire building. The landlord is willing
to hold the mortgage and transfer the city liquor license for one-third down
($70,000), followed by monthly payments of $2,000. Like other religious institutions, this TEMPLE would generate a substantial monthly income through membership fees, donations, and special events. 

#2 Choice - I've also located a storefront at 322 East State Street, This location has a commercial kitchen in it. This kitchen would generate a income for myself as well as money to operate the temple (SANCTUARY ROOM), and to fund cannabis legalization projects #legalizenj here in New Jersey.   If this is the start of a great Temple in a storefront - so be it. It will out grow its walls, so fast I will laugh at those who didn't support plan #1 because there will be other #1 buildings. 
I BELIEVE I
COULD BE THE FACE OF THIS TEMPLE AGAIN
There's been a lot of news about Cannabis Churches, I want to be the Corporate director of The Liberty Bell Temple III, and I want YOU to become a member. ( We will give every member of our congregation a laminated membership card. ) 
I want to run the daily
operations of this TEMPLE as the director, but it would be staffed by green collar activists, and religious persons - it would become the
headquarters of the local unfunded marijuana-legalization organizations and social-awareness causes. I want to openly
operate this TEMPLE where congregants can partake of their sacrament in peace
and in good company. It would be an immoveable object, a static headquarters for the NJ marijuana-legalization
movement and for stoners of all stripes - under our spiritual house.
The LBT3 would once again be a Mecca for potheads, intellectuals, spiritual herbalists—from everyday folks who love herb and one another to green-collar
activists who are putting their hearts and souls into amending the unnecessary and
unfair marijuana laws (in New Jersey and beyond) to the suit-and-tie types (if
they feel like coming through). Special events would include chess nights, Karaoke days, fish fry's, political bull sessions, and religious-reasoning sessions. The sky's the limit on what we can do. ""LETS GET HIGH"" 
I’ve made appeals to the
community before, and they have come through, but this is the biggest endeavor I’ve ever asked the Cannabis Community to undertake. I've always believed the religious component of
legalization is important, and I have always championed this aspect of the multifaceted argument in favor of legalization. The religious concept is sound, the legal protection is ingrained
in the First Amendment and ensured by the Religious Restoration Act. The TEMPLE can work. In
fact, it has: 
Precedent: 
JAH RASTAFARI CENTER: Browns
Mills, NJ (1998 –2007)
Liberty Bell Temple II, Los
Angeles, CA (9/2008–2/2012)

I loved what I did in Los Angeles, but
the government's actions have lead me back to my home turf of New Jersey, and the NJ battle for legalization that I could never truly abandon. My efforts weren’t a cakewalk in California—my KARMA says I was meant to come back to NJ where the frontline battle is.
California is where I honed my skills. Now I'm home—New Jersey is my Home. It's where my heart is. I’m a Jersey guy. In a
spiritual way I feel guided to be here now, I feel this in my heart, I’m ready
to do this here and now. 
This TEMPLE is for all of us. If
you support what I’ve been saying for all these years and believe in what I’m
doing, please contribute. 
This TEMPLE is something that we
can all celebrate as we make strides to free ourselves from the
yoke of cannabis prohibition.        ___________________________________________________________________CURRENT LEGAL NJ ARGUMENTS FOR NJ COURT OF APPEALS: I HAVE CHALLENGED THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY'S CRIMINAL MARIJUANA LAWS, - ONE STRONG ARGUMENT INCLUDED IN THIS HISTORIC APPEAL IS - THE STATE FAILED TO PROVIDE A RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO ITS CRIMINAL LAWS, AS IT HAS DONE FOR A SECULAR (medical) PURPOSE (currently there is no religious cannabis case in New Jersey since 2010 medical laws).On MAY 4th, 2015 - Oral Arguments scheduled for 9:30am : Hughes Justice Complex, NJ Court of Appeals, (Part B)25 Markets Street, Trenton , NJSTATE OF NEW JERSEY vs FORCHION, A-004052, A-004477-12,

In 2009, according to UNICEF, there were about 1.8 million children exploited for the sex trade. It is a billion dollar industry for organized crime.For my wife and I, God had put on our hearts to serve and seek the lost. The very vulnerable, the outcast of society but they are God's beloved, the children and women exploited in sex slavery. For 5 years now, the Lord made it clear to us through much prayers, scriptures, dreams and visions, that He had called us to reach out to the broken hearted.One of these countries is Cambodia where XP missions are in need of financial support to continue their fight against human trafficking. Some ministries and services that are run by XP missions include:
Ministry in slum and garbage dump communities
Ministry to women working in the sex industry
Ministry to children rescued from sex slavery
Street Evangelism 
Prayer and intercession for the city, nation, and social justice issues
Partnering activities with other local ministries and christian missionaries.
Teenage girls' and boys ministry
Ministry to street kids
Please see below a short 4 minute clip about one woman's horror story of human trafficking :


We are looking to raise $10,000  for XP missions to support them in their work and ministry against sex slavery. Ways to help:1. MAKE A MONETARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN:

<h2><strong>Heroes Don’t Always Wear Capes:</strong></h2>
<h3>Honoring Dads Around the World this Father’s Day</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497012679/t5s3ujjfok9noxb8kexx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Hero</strong></i> is a Greek word used to describe a person or character who faces danger, combating adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength—often sacrificing their own personal concerns for a greater good. Most often the word is attributed to fictional characters of epic proportions. But if you think about it, heroes are all around us, quietly creating a better world for us all, one small act at a time. At Just Like My Child Foundation (JLMC), we want to take this time to honor our Dads for their daily heroic actions.</p>
<p>In most cultures, fathers are regarded as secondary caregivers. However in parenting, the importance of a father's role should not be diminished. Dads can represent authority, safety, security, and certainty for children.  Research shows that an increased amount of father-child involvement may increase a child’s social stability, educational achievement, and their potential to have a successful marriage. Children who have a father or father-figure in their lives tend to be more curious about the world around them, develop greater problem solving skills, and tend to have higher self-esteem. <i>Impressive results for the guy who's often considered a secondary caregiver!</i></p>

<h3>Saluting Heroic Dads in Uganda</h3>
<p>We’ve all heard stories about Dads being able to lift a car off their child in Herculean fashion. <strong>JLMC wants to salute the Dads in Uganda who are using their strength to remove obstacles for their kids to reach their full potential. </strong>These Dads are willing to stand out in their community in support of their girl child and stand up for their children’s rights in defiance of a cultural norm. When going against custom, they face criticism, ostracism, and sometimes personal danger. They face incredible hardships, financial uncertainty, and peer pressure by making their children’s well-being a top priority. These are the Dads whose bravery we honor. They are ignoring gender norms to become an emotional safe space, trusted mentors, and lifelong advocates for their children.</p>
<p>JLMC has met many of these fathers in our decade of working in Uganda. In fact, their leadership is often more potent for community change: when a father leads, the community will follow. Men in Uganda possess more power and privilege than women do. In an area where nearly <strong>50% of girls drop out of school by age 15</strong>, where <strong>86.9% of rape victims are between the ages of 9 and 17</strong>, and where <strong>31% of girls ages 15-19 have been pregnant</strong> or have had a child, JLMC counts on these male role models to help deliver the first step in implementing our Girl Power Project. </p>
<p>The first step is to introduce laws of the land and human rights to a community, creating a network of support that promotes gender equality, law enforcement and the reduction of domestic violence and rape. It lays the foundation for girls’ and women’s empowerment in communities. These male change agents are convincing men and boys to question harmful and traditional norms regarding manhood. <strong>They are heroes without capes.</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE GHOST PEOPLE OF TANZANIA</strong></p>
<p>They are called, <i>zeru zeru</i>, which in Swahili translates to the <strong>ghost people </strong>- these are the persecuted people with albinism (PWA) in Tanzania. Currently, Tanzania holds the world’s largest population of people living with albinism with 1 in every 1,400 individuals. But for country with such a large albinism population there is little awareness on the fact that albinism is a genetic condition. As a result of these misconceptions, the albinism population lives under the daily threat of <strong>abuse</strong>, <strong>abductions</strong>, and <strong>ritual killings</strong>. </p>
<p>Witchcraft is at the root of Tanzanian culture, and  ‘<strong>Albino elixir</strong>’ has become a formula of which <i>waganga wa kenyeji</i> (African witch doctors) brew albino body parts fueling beliefs. They spread the lie that these potions bring wealth, power, and good fortune.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">PWA have been <strong>kidnapped</strong>, <strong>tortured</strong>, and the <strong>murdered</strong> because of this misbelief.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Over the years, the situation has severely <strong>worsened</strong>, with the body parts of PWA selling for <strong>over $75,000</strong> on the black market.This large sum of money in a country with great poverty has dismantled many communities as neighbors, friends, family members have evolved into murderers. This persecution over pigment has been mythologized for “medicine” and voodoo killings, and has created the genocide of the albino population.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE VISUAL ADVOCACY PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>In late August, I will be spending five weeks in Tanzania to create a visual advocacy project exploring the identities of Tanzanian PWA. The aim for every photograph produced is to combat the discrimination and attacks against people with albinism through education and advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>Through powerful testimony and public art, I hope to create a bridge for Tanzanian society<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> to become informed on truths of the condition and advocate for the inclusive human rights of people with albinism.</span></strong></p>
<p>I will push the boundaries of the medium by exposing the photographs in the means of large-scale diptychs throughout Tanzania, bringing art into the streets - as a means of a public space for an encounter between a subject and it’s audience. One side of the diptych will be a photograph of a PWA conveying their unique personality and identity. The other will display a written passage, sharing their experience and voice. Please reference mockup below:</p>

<p>    </p>
<p>Bringing these images to a privileged space such as a gallery or online publication will not allow me to reach my targeted audience. These visual documents need to be seen by the very society that created these fallacies.</p>
<p>To go about the project, I will be collaborating with Tanzanian organization: <strong>Under the Same Sun</strong>. UTSS is passionately committed to ending discrimination and violence against persons with albinism and facilitating social inclusion and participation. Through the guidance of UTSS, I will have the opportunity to conduct thorough field researching techniques and become integrated into the albinism community as sensitively as possible.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">                </p>
<p>When human rights are ignored, the marginalization of certain persons within a society prevent such a group from becoming involved and benefitting from development. People with albinism have been rendered worthless by a society that denies their existence, yet their bodies hold a high commercial value for those that believe they hold magical power. These individuals live their entire life hidden. Hidden from the sun, hidden from light, hidden from others, hidden in the shadow of the world.</p>

<p><strong>3</strong> - To treat people with albinism with dignity, respect, and equality. To eradicate stigma and discrimination and for PWA to have the same opportunities for health, safety, gainful employment and personal fulfillment as everybody else.</p>

Intelegem de ce ai plecat din tara ta si mai intelegem si ca trebuie sa iti fie foarte greu acolo unde esti. Ai lasat in urma oamenii apropiati tie, pentru a le oferi un viitor mai promitator si mai sigur. Exact acesta este si scopul nostru, scopul Beard Brothers.La inceputul lunii februarie, raportul anual SMURD a dezvaluit o serie de informatii ingrijoratoare despre echipamentele si vehiculele SMURD. ”Cele mai importante probleme sunt legate de ambulantele cu care lucram si aparatura de pe ele, sunt ambulante vechi cu aparatura veche. Problemele apar cand mergi la o interventie si constati, pe drum, ca ambulanta nu mai trage si ceri dispeceratului sa trimita alta. Sunt si situaţii si mai grave cand ajungi la caz si se defecteaza ambulanta cu un pacient in stare critica in masina, atunci esti intr-o situatie disperata.” – medicul sef UPU-SMURD Cluj, Cristian Ursu. ”La capitolul ambulante stam cel mai prost, avem o singura ambulanta cu vechime de 6 ani în interventie, restul sunt de la 7 ani in sus. Se strica frecvent, au fost ambulante stricate, nu am avut bani sa le reparam si, astfel, au fost zone din judet care nu au mai fost acoperite” – Seful ISU Cluj, Ion Moldovan.Poate ca ati auzit despre noi sau poate ca nu. Dar noi v-am auzit. Stim ca Romania este in continuare “acasa” pentru voi si ca aveti inca speranta ca lucrurile se vor schimba in bine. Mai stim si ca doriti sa ne ajutati, dar nu ati avut ocazia sa o faceti. Acum o aveti! O ambulanta noua costa 150.000 euro. Cu ajutorul celor de acasa am reusit sa strangem mai mult de jumatate din suma. Acum avem nevoie de voi, pentru ca dorim sa strangem o parte din suma ramasa cu ajutorul vostru.Frumusetea acestei platforme este ca poti dona in orice moneda!Cum ne mai poti ajuta?Da un share, ca sa raspandesti vestea. EN Almost 10 million Romanians are living abroad.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Olive Trees For Palestine</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Support Local Economies in the 3rd Oldest City in the World</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The Boulder-Nablus Sister City Project (BNSCP) fosters relationships through cultural, educational and professional exchanges, inspiring lifelong friendships that promote understanding and peace through person-to-person “citizen diplomacy.”</p>
<p>Through ongoing conversations with our Sister City we have found that one of the largest requests from the community is the desire for olive trees. These trees are historically very important to local communities as they provide oil, income, cohesion, collaboration and cooperation among residents.</p>
<p>BNSCP chose the goal $5,430 as this is the elevation of Boulder. This amount will provide 815 one and a half year-old saplings to be planted in villages adjacent to Nablus. A collective of community partners are currently working on designating the right villages to plant the trees. </p>
<p>In March of this year, a delegation will travel to Nablus, Palestine and spend a day helping farmers to plant the olive tree saplings. You are welcome to join the delegation. Get more information <a href=""http://bouldernablus.org/projects-2/delegations/delegation-2020/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p>As a part of the International Sister City Program, BNSCP has been able able to cultivate relationships between communities in Nablus and Boulder through a whole range of projects since 2011. We have also taken dozens of Coloradans to the West Bank on delegations to meet with local residents and representatives.  </p>
<p>For more information on the BNSCP please visit <a href=""http://bouldernablus.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bouldernablus.org/</a> and Facebook page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BoulderNablusSisterCity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/BoulderNablusSisterCity/</a></p>
<p>With your help we look forward to a better future. </p>

<p>""Olive trees carry more than an economic significance in the lives of Palestinians. They are not just like any another trees, they are symbolic of Palestinians’ attachment to their land.

The fact that olive trees live and bear fruit for thousands of years is parallel to Palestinian history and continuity on the land. Palestinians are proud of their olive trees; they take care of them with care and appreciation. Palestine has some of the world’s oldest olive trees, dating back to 4,000 years. Some families have trees that have been passed down to them for generations and the olive harvest season in October bears a socio-cultural meaning where families come together to harvest olive trees bearing in mind that their forefathers and mothers had tended to the same trees several years ago.</p>
<p>In addition to their symbolic meaning, olives are a main source of income for around 80,000 Palestinian families. According to UN figures, around 48% of the agricultural land in the West Bank and Gaza is planted with olive trees. Olive trees account for 70% of fruit production in Palestine and contribute around 14% to the Palestinian economy. 93% of the olive harvest is used for olive oil production while the rest is used for olive soap, table olives and pickles. Much of the olive production is for local consumption with a small amount of olives being exported primarily to Jordan. With the growing interest in organic food and fair trade, Palestinian olives are now also reaching European and North American markets.""</p>

Support Local Economies in the 3rd Oldest City in the World
 
The Boulder-Nablus Sister City Project (BNSCP) fosters relationships through cultural, educational and professional exchanges, inspiring lifelong friendships that promote understanding and peace through person-to-person “citizen diplomacy.”
Through ongoing conversations with our Sister City we have found that one of the largest requests from the community is the desire for olive trees. These trees are historically very important to local communities as they provide oil, income, cohesion, collaboration and cooperation among residents.
BNSCP chose the goal $5,430 as this is the elevation of Boulder. This amount will provide 815 one and a half year-old saplings to be planted in villages adjacent to Nablus. A collective of community partners are currently working on designating the right villages to plant the trees. 
In March of this year, a delegation will travel to Nablus, Palestine and spend a day helping farmers to plant the olive tree saplings. You are welcome to join the delegation. Get more information here. 
As a part of the International Sister City Program, BNSCP has been able able to cultivate relationships between communities in Nablus and Boulder through a whole range of projects since 2011. We have also taken dozens of Coloradans to the West Bank on delegations to meet with local residents and representatives.  
For more information on the BNSCP please visit http://bouldernablus.org/ and Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/BoulderNablusSisterCity/
With your help we look forward to a better future. 

Together let's support our friends in Nablus.
From Boulder to Nablus we thank you for your support!

<ul>
<li>Using deadly force in combat and causing the harm or death of civilians, knowingly but without alternatives, or accidentally</li>
<li>Giving orders in combat that result in the injury or death of a fellow service member</li>
<li>Failing to provide medical aid to an injured civilian or service member</li>
<li>Returning home from deployment and hearing of the executions of cooperating local nationals</li>
<li>Failing to report knowledge of a sexual assault or rape committed against oneself, a fellow service member, or civilians</li>
<li>Following orders that were illegal, immoral, and/or against the Rules of Engagement (ROE) or Geneva Convention</li>
<li>A change in belief about the necessity or justification for war, during or after one’s service</li>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>$15,000 gets the ball rolling. This will pay for operating expenses so that Executive Director, Iraq vet, MBA Paul Riedner can begin spreading the news that VRP offers any MN veteran free EMDR trauma therapy. During that outreach Paul will be meeting with and interviewing veterans to help them tell their story on the #ResilienceMN podcast. </p>This is the strategy for finding the women and men most in need of EMDR trauma therapy. There are only a few closest family members, friends, and veteran community leaders in each area that have the chance to share the show with those suffering the most. Isolation and shame is a formidable barrier, so we need to inspire the community to recognize that this is a chance to make it right by every veteran and turn their life around.  <br/><br/><br/>BUT
<p><b>HOW CAN WE REBUILD THE TRUST OF VETERANS?      <br/></b></p>
<p><b>By listening....<br/></b></p>
<p>I will employ ethnographic researching techniques to spend time with an exceptional set of veterans from across Minnesota  in their daily lives. I will use my background in the military, my education in user behavior, and my storytelling abilities to gather an authentic, first person point of view of the veteran's ideas, feelings, experiences, hopes, dreams, fears, and triumphs. <br/></p>
<p>The Plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadow &amp; Interview  10 veterans around the state (1 on 1)</li>
<li>Tell their stories with a mini-series dedicated to veteran resilience that will give the larger community an unvarnished, honest look into the lives of their most resilient warriors to begin bridging the chasm between veterans and civilians.</li>
<li>Sell/Distribute the audio documentary series on: Minnesota Public Radio, college radio, and state-wide community radio network <br/>
</li>
<li>Submit as podcasts on iTunes, Stitcher, and other podcast directories.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$5 </b>Twitter shout out. Thank you for stepping up to the challenge. We need strong communities 
willing to be accountable for the events of the 2000's. We think you are
 making a strong statement about the value of taking care of those who 
we send to fight.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$25 </b>Digital downloads of #ResilienceMN mini-series</li>
<li>
<b>$50 </b>Digital downloads<b> </b>of #ResilienceMN and a VRP shirt.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$100</b> Digital downloads of #ResilienceMN and a VRP hooded sweatshirt<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$500</b> Digital downloads of mini-series and a ""Pict-Oral"" print by artist Mary Shaubschlager, based on the military experience of VRP Executive Director Paul Riedner, called ""Self-Contained.""  5 items available. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$2,000</b> VRP will present to your company or organization our findings about the state of veteran health, how to understand PTSD and Moral Injury, and how to engage with the veteran community more authentically. </li>
<li>
<b>$5,000</b> Executive Producer Credit - This level of support will be featured during the audio 
series being broadcast on radio and podcast and be recognized on the up and coming website. Great perk for an 
organization that wants to be associated with truly inspirational work 
designed to better understand veterans better.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
Where the funds go:<br/><ul>
<li>Travel expenses <br/>
</li>
<li>Audio productions costs</li>
<li>Website design &amp; execution</li>
<li>Operations (labor costs)</li>
</ul>
* The first $30,000 raised will be used to generate the connections to MN veterans thru travel, meals, lodging and costs to produce, sell, and distribute the resulting audio mini-series. Public and private grants are being  submitted to cover the EMDR therapy service costs and program costs. <br/><br/>* Any funds raised over $30,000 will allow VRP to offer free EMDR trauma therapy to any referrals our campaign generates. EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization &amp; Reprocessing. It has an effective success rating between 70 - 80% in over 20 randomized clinical studies and a 73.5% rate in VRP's pilot project in Minnesota with 27 veterans. It's safe, drug-free, confidential, and has been utilized by over 2,000,000 people worldwide to help people recover from trauma. Don't you think our veterans deserve that? <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>Every veteran in our community has the potential within her/him to be a major asset to our economy, community, and apply their exceptional dedication, work ethic, selfless service, and courage to lift us all up, but STEP #1 is processing the trauma. <br/>
</li>
<li>After the trauma is processed, veterans begin utilizing the other services and benefits available to them, multiplying the impact. <br/>
</li>
<li>If the community of veteran care givers, friends, family, and neighbors get involved with this campaign, the impact will be exponential. <br/>
</li>
<li>Between 50 - 75,000 war veterans in Minnesota, each with a network of family and friends, as well as communities of churches, schools, work places, etc that are connected to the issue and need to understand urgency of the issue.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Episode #1 w/ Gary Melom

Summary Myself and over 50,000 other Minnesotans served in the wars in Iraq & Afghanistan. The simple fact is whether by consent or dissent, this community sent us there. We did what was necessary, but in the process, suffered from a host of invisible wounds. 

Post Traumatic Stress - effecting  at least 1 in 4
Military Sexual Trauma - 1 of every 5 women in military are sexually assaulted

Moral Injury - Def: Moral injury is the damage done to one’s conscience or moral compass when
 that person perpetrates, witnesses, or fails to prevent acts that 
transgress their own moral and ethical values or codes of conduct.Examples of Moral Injury:

Using deadly force in combat and causing the harm or death of civilians, knowingly but without alternatives, or accidentally
Giving orders in combat that result in the injury or death of a fellow service member
Failing to provide medical aid to an injured civilian or service member
Returning home from deployment and hearing of the executions of cooperating local nationals
Failing to report knowledge of a sexual assault or rape committed against oneself, a fellow service member, or civilians
Following orders that were illegal, immoral, and/or against the Rules of Engagement (ROE) or Geneva Convention
A change in belief about the necessity or justification for war, during or after one’s service




“I would bet anything, that if we had the wherewithal to do this kind of research we’d find that moral injury underlies veteran homelessness, criminal behavior, and suicide.”
William P. Nash, a retired Navy psychiatrist and a pioneer in stress control and moral injury.


TRUTHS:

The Minnesota National Guard has the worst suicide rate in the country
22 veterans take their life every single day in the US.
The number of organizations focused on serving veterans increased over 350% since 9/11.
The VA Medical Center helps a fraction of returning veterans.
It's the community's responsibility to find the right care for struggling veterans. 


THE MYTHS:

PTSD is forever (WRONG)
PTSD requires pharmaceuticals (WRONG)

Veterans without combat experience don't suffer (WRONG)
It's solely the responsibility of the VA  to care for returning veterans (WRONG)
The VA utilizes the most effective PTSD treatment options (WRONG)
A civilian cannot understand what troubles a veteran (WRONG, in fact the public's role in the events that led to the veteran's trauma and how much burden and responsibility the public is willing to accept in the aftermath, directly effects a veteran's prospect of recovery)










  What We Need & What You Get $15,000 gets the ball rolling. This will pay for operating expenses so that Executive Director, Iraq vet, MBA Paul Riedner can begin spreading the news that VRP offers any MN veteran free EMDR trauma therapy. During that outreach Paul will be meeting with and interviewing veterans to help them tell their story on the #ResilienceMN podcast. This is the strategy for finding the women and men most in need of EMDR trauma therapy. There are only a few closest family members, friends, and veteran community leaders in each area that have the chance to share the show with those suffering the most. Isolation and shame is a formidable barrier, so we need to inspire the community to recognize that this is a chance to make it right by every veteran and turn their life around.  BUT
HOW CAN WE REBUILD THE TRUST OF VETERANS?      
By listening....
I will employ ethnographic researching techniques to spend time with an exceptional set of veterans from across Minnesota  in their daily lives. I will use my background in the military, my education in user behavior, and my storytelling abilities to gather an authentic, first person point of view of the veteran's ideas, feelings, experiences, hopes, dreams, fears, and triumphs. 
The Plan:

Shadow & Interview  10 veterans around the state (1 on 1)
Tell their stories with a mini-series dedicated to veteran resilience that will give the larger community an unvarnished, honest look into the lives of their most resilient warriors to begin bridging the chasm between veterans and civilians.
Sell/Distribute the audio documentary series on: Minnesota Public Radio, college radio, and state-wide community radio network 

Submit as podcasts on iTunes, Stitcher, and other podcast directories.




Perks:


$5 Twitter shout out. Thank you for stepping up to the challenge. We need strong communities 
willing to be accountable for the events of the 2000's. We think you are
 making a strong statement about the value of taking care of those who 
we send to fight.


$25 Digital downloads of #ResilienceMN mini-series

$50 Digital downloads of #ResilienceMN and a VRP shirt.


$100 Digital downloads of #ResilienceMN and a VRP hooded sweatshirt


$500 Digital downloads of mini-series and a ""Pict-Oral"" print by artist Mary Shaubschlager, based on the military experience of VRP Executive Director Paul Riedner, called ""Self-Contained.""  5 items available. 


$2,000 VRP will present to your company or organization our findings about the state of veteran health, how to understand PTSD and Moral Injury, and how to engage with the veteran community more authentically. 

$5,000 Executive Producer Credit - This level of support will be featured during the audio 
series being broadcast on radio and podcast and be recognized on the up and coming website. Great perk for an 
organization that wants to be associated with truly inspirational work 
designed to better understand veterans better.


Where the funds go:
Travel expenses 

Audio productions costs
Website design & execution
Operations (labor costs)

* The first $30,000 raised will be used to generate the connections to MN veterans thru travel, meals, lodging and costs to produce, sell, and distribute the resulting audio mini-series. Public and private grants are being  submitted to cover the EMDR therapy service costs and program costs. * Any funds raised over $30,000 will allow VRP to offer free EMDR trauma therapy to any referrals our campaign generates. EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing. It has an effective success rating between 70 - 80% in over 20 randomized clinical studies and a 73.5% rate in VRP's pilot project in Minnesota with 27 veterans. It's safe, drug-free, confidential, and has been utilized by over 2,000,000 people worldwide to help people recover from trauma. Don't you think our veterans deserve that? 
  The Impact  Every veteran in our community has the potential within her/him to be a major asset to our economy, community, and apply their exceptional dedication, work ethic, selfless service, and courage to lift us all up, but STEP #1 is processing the trauma. 

After the trauma is processed, veterans begin utilizing the other services and benefits available to them, multiplying the impact. 

If the community of veteran care givers, friends, family, and neighbors get involved with this campaign, the impact will be exponential. 

Between 50 - 75,000 war veterans in Minnesota, each with a network of family and friends, as well as communities of churches, schools, work places, etc that are connected to the issue and need to understand urgency of the issue.


Board of Directors
The Veteran Resilience Project is a registered 501(c)3. We are fortunate to have the support, guidance, and wisdom of an exceptional board of directors. 





Track Record
Paul Riedner has been developing his advocacy and storytelling skills since returning from the military. Examples of his earlier works include:FILM""Support the Troops: A Veteran's View"" - An 8 minute short documentary that is being screened in theaters across Minnesota and the midwest in the independent film festival circuit. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTMinnesota Veteran Arts Experience 2014 - Co-founded a collaborative, week long events series designed to utilize the arts to facilitate greater understanding between the community and veterans. Over 25 veterans attended the week long art retreat, taking art classes by members of the Red Wing Arts Association and living together in dorm style arrangements to build trust and community.

<h3>Who I am:</h3>
<p>I am Liesbet Bickett .   As a consultant and trainer I use <a href=""http://www.cnvc.org/about/what-is-nvc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nonviolent Communication</a> and <a href=""http://www.iirp.edu/what-we-do/what-is-restorative-practices/defining-restorative"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Restorative Practices</a> to help community organizations, community leaders, businesses, families and individuals build collaborative, strong and safe relationships in which all members work together for the good of the community and the good of the individual.  In addition to the work I do within my community I am currently working on my MS in Restorative Practices with the International Institute of Restorative Practices.</p>
<h3>My Vision</h3>
<p>My vision is inspired by the vision of the <a href=""http://iirp.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Institute of Restorative Practices</a>, in particular the work they are doing in <a href=""http://www.iirp.edu/news/2368-toward-a-restorative-detroit-transforming-relationships-in-the-motor-city"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Detroit</a>, and their broader vision for restorative communities across the globe. The featured video on this campaign is a part of their <a href=""http://www.iirp.edu/education-programs/continuing-education/projects/toward-a-restorative-community"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">restorative community project</a>.  Although this campaign is not connected to the IIRP and their work in anyway it is fully inspired by them.</p>
<p>Restorative Practices is a social science which integrates theories and practices across disciplines, including education, psychology, social work, criminology, organizational development, sociology, and leadership, using participatory decision making and learning, with the goal to build social capital, minimize undesirable behavior, maximize desirable behavior, repair harm and rebuild relationships.  From the science of restorative practices has come a group of practices, and more importantly, a philosophy underlying those practices which enables and supports the sharing of power for the benefit of the whole, within relationships and structures.</p>
<p><i>""The fundamental premise of restorative practices is that people are happier, more cooperative and productive, and more likely to make positive changes when those in positions of authority do things <strong>with </strong>them, rather than <strong>to</strong> them or <strong>for</strong> them."" (<a href=""http://www.iirp.edu/what-we-do/what-is-restorative-practices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What is Restorative Practices?,</a> 2015)</i></p>
<p>I share the IIRP vision for communities of America and am starting with my home community in North Lake Tahoe.  In my vision, citizens work together creating communities where children and families are safe and have the social infrastructure they need to thrive.   Each citizen is engaged and recognizes their role as a valuable contributor to the community.  Community members consider the challenges faced by the community and support each other using restorative practices.  Lead by a team of stakeholders from organizations which work with children and families across the spectrum of support citizens are empowered to solve their own problems rather than have needs and challenges assigned to outside agencies who then dictate and mandate solutions from afar.  </p>
<p>I see our country suffering under the power of dividing interests. I hear fear, anger and hopelessness in households from every religion, race, and socio-economic group.  I believe the power to unite and strengthen our country lies within our communities. We are being called to create the world we want to live in, starting at home. Community by community I see transformation which bridges the divide of differences by building on what we share, a desire for safe and supportive homes for our children and our loved ones to grow, learn, and contribute. </p>
<p>My current goal is to train 20 community leaders to act as stakeholders, to build and implement a vision for a restorative community in North Lake Tahoe.  Your contribution will allow me to train and support these 20 leaders and to begin the planning and implementation process with them.  </p>
<p>The Introduction to Restorative Practice Training is a 4 day training.  Day 1 is an introduction to RP, including theory, and common practices. Day 2 works with circles and how to use them effectively to build community and repair harm. Day 3 and 4 trainer leaders to run restorative conferences for their organization and the community at large.

<p>Restorative conferences are a formal restorative response which is used to repair harm and reintegrate both those harmed and those who have done harm back into the community. Conferences are driven by the needs of those harmed, with the goal of healing and repair.  They also give those who have caused harm to be accountable for their actions and to repair the harm they have done.

""influence human behavior and strengthen civil society around the world. Restorative practices builds healthy communities, increases social capital, reduces the impact of crime, decreases antisocial behavior, repairs harm and restores relationships.""(Defining Restorative, 2015)
Restorative practices has already made a difference in schools and communities across the globe.  In schools alone Restorative Practices has been shown to 

Decrease ""visits to the office""

Decrease the number of students with multiple suspensions
Reduce aggression
Increase social skills

(Improving School Climate, 2014)
Across the globe restorative practices are being used to empower citizens as active stewards of their community, from neighborhood community building circles, to restorative conferences for resolving and repairing after conflict and harm, to family group decision making conferences which support families who are struggling.  Restorative practices ""brings alignment between systems and neighborhoods that impact children and families.""(Toward a Restorative Community, 2015)

This increase is driven by a deterioration of the situation in key humanitarian sectors.</p><p><strong>Food Security and Agriculture</strong></p><p>17.8 million people in Yemen are food insecure. Out of this, approximately 8.4 million people are severely food insecure and at risk of starvation - a worrying increase of 24 per cent. The conflict has destroyed people’s livelihoods and reduced their purchasing power, making it difficult for many Yemenis to meet minimal food needs.</p><p><strong>Health</strong></p><p>With only 50 per cent of health facilities fully functional, and a disruption of salaries paid to health personnel, 16.4 million people in Yemen require assistance to ensure adequate access to healthcare – 9.3 million of whom are in acute need.</p><p>The overriding humanitarian need is access to minimum healthcare for people whose lives are at risk due to illness or injury. The latest cholera outbreak has underscored the impact of the failing health system.</p><p><strong>Water, Sanitation and hygiene</strong></p><p>An estimated 16 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to establish or maintain access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene facilities, out of which 11.6 million are in acute need. Collapsing urban water and sanitation systems, deteriorating water and sanitation conditions in rural areas, and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene and purchase safe drinking water all contributed to one of the worst cholera outbreaks.</p><p><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p><p>Some 1.8 million children and 1.1 million pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished, including 400,000 children under the age 5 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. An estimated 7.5 million people are in need of nutrition assistance, with 2.9 million people who will require treatment for acute malnutrition in 2017.</p><p><strong>Shelter and essential items</strong></p><p>An estimated 5.4 million people need emergency shelter or essential household items, including IDPs, host communities and initial returnees. Ongoing conflict-related displacements, as well as initial returns to some areas, are driving these needs. 2.6 million people are in acute need of assistance.</p><p><strong>Protection</strong></p><p>With the increasing conflict, Yemen is one of the world’s largest protection crises. About 12.9 million people need assistance to</p><p>protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of IHL, grave violations of children’s rights and gender-based violence.</p><p>Displacement and conflict has impacted vulnerable households and persons with specific needs, resulting in negative coping mechanisms and mounting psychosocial support needs. 4.9 million people are living in acutely affected areas.</p><p><strong>Education</strong></p><p>The 2017/2018 school year started with a setback in the education process in 13 out of 22 governorates.

Join us in our work, and donate in funds or awareness!We are trying to make this yet another successful campaign, just like our previous ones - only with the help of you guys.Yemen and the People of it, needs your help more than ever - you dont need to help in money, you can help in awareness. Spreading information about Yemen is just as important as donating, because at the end of the day, this war can only be stopped if we start speaking out.Our work only makes the war less worse for people we are trying to help, but it certainly does not stop the atrocities from being committed - for that to be stopped, your voice is needed. Children Are Dying from Preventable Diseases Caused by MalnutritionOver 70% of the country's population is in need of help, and the number is only growing. According to the UN, 3.1 million people, with nearly half of them children, are internally displaced, living under deteriorating conditions with nothing but a few belongings.Yemen's already weak infrastructure is being destroyed at the expense of its civilians, making even the most basic necessities hard to obtain. Because of the crumbling health system, thousands of children are dying from preventable diseases, which are linked to malnutrition. According to a recent UNICEF report, the rate of severe acute malnutrition has tripled between 2014 and 2016 to 460,000 children. Mona Relief - Call To ActionIn an effort to combat the blockade restrictions while directly aiding the needy, the Mona Relief Organization (Yemen Charity Registration Number : 177/2015) was founded in 2015 by Fatik Al-Rodaini, a Journalist and Human Rights Activist. A nonprofit organization, Mona Relief relies largely on local and international volunteers to promote their cause and distribute supplies on ground. In addition to critical aid, blankets, medical equipment, and clothing have been distributed around the country to families in need. Feed Families With Locally Bought GoodBy donating even a few dollars, you are saving the lives and improving the well-being of many suffering families with no where to go. These people suffer under conditions much worse than we can imagine, and it's only right to help the less fortunate. Yemenis are living in fear of their lives everyday, and the least we can do is to extend a hand to those in need. All proceeds will go toward the Mona Relief organization, and goods will be bought locally when possible to keep money within the economy.Please donate! If you cannot, then please share this with friends and family to spread awareness. Every act of goodness counts. Yemen needs your help, and it needs help now. Your donation will ultimately bring relief to an underserved community living in fear. For more information on the organization's recent activities, please click here.Mona Relief has been carried out over 200 projects in Yemen since the war started in 2015.Mona Relief, a 100% Yemeni Organization based in Yemen took the initiative with this campaign. With as simple as 30 USD, you are able to feed a family for a whole month.The organization activities are mainly focused in the field of humanitarian relief and development by motivating and organizing volunteer, charitable and humanitarian work.We had great success with the campaign from 2016 (#20foryemen) , 2017 and 2018 (Ramadan Campaign), we hope for an even greater success for this campaign. Our activities during 2017 increased rapidly with many projects. Our fundraising campaign for Aslam area of Hajjeh sets to begin here, and we hope you will help the people of Yemen to achieve it. This is me (Faitk) in our latest campaign in Aslam that we funded from our previous indiegogo campaign. Watch me talking in this video:  Some of our previous campaigns What Is Happening in Yemen and what is Mona Relief's mission?Saudi Arabia together with a coalition launched a bombing campaign in Yemen on 25 March 2015 and imposed a blockade on all Yemeni sea, land and airports which has restricted entry of all supplies into the country.To get more information about the current situation in Yemen you have to read thisA coalition led by Saudi Arabia, which backs Yemen's officially recognized government, is battling against Houthi group, who are Yemeni but are thought to be backed by Iran.Since March 2015 Yemen has become the battleground of a horrific war, which has led to one of the biggest humanitarian disasters in the world. More than 10,000 people have been killed and more than 60,000 people have been wounded, many of them civilians. Of the population 80 per cent is in need of humanitarian aid, and the destruction of the (social) infrastructure is beyond imagination.As many as 13 million people in Yemen are facing starvation in what could be the “worst famine seen anywhere in the world for 100 years”, according to the UN.As a result of all this, almost three-quarters of Yemen’s 27.58 million population are currently reliant on aid. Of that total of approximately 22.2 million, 8.4 million are starving, 1.8 million of those being children, according to Unicef.For almost 4 years, Yemen has been in a humanitarian crisis as conflicts between the Houthis and a Saudi-led coalition continue to ensue. Thrust into a civil war with no say, millions of innocent civilians are suffering the consequences with limited food and medical assistance. With Saudi Arabia and its allies imposing a complete air and naval blockade, the famine crisis has only exacerbated as supplies were cut off to the 22.2 million people in dire need of humanitarian aid.To bring ease to vulnerable communities, Mona Relief is aiming through this campaign to expend its activities to be able to reach out more needy families across the country with urgent assistance, such as food necessities, medicine and shelter items, etc.A 100% volunteer organization, ground crew will distribute supplies, ensuring your donation will be stretched to the maximum dollar.OUR MISSION:To prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies with the power of collaborative efforts and the generosity of donors.OUR VISION:To be the most effective humanitarian organization in Yemen, with a view to preventing and alleviating human suffering, and promoting human dignity.OUR VALUES:Our fundamental principles promote: Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity, Transparency. Yemen in NumbersYemen has become a failed and devastated state. Since March 2015, 9,245 people have been killed and 52,800 injured. Coalition air strikes are the leading cause of civilian casualties. According to the U.N. Human Rights Council, civilians have repeatedly been the victims of ""unrelenting violations of international humanitarian law."" About 75 percent of the population — 22.2 million people — needs humanitarian assistance. Some 17.8 million people do not know where their next meal is coming from, and 8.4 million are considered at risk of starvation. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of 5. Half of the country's 3,500 health facilities are functioning and at least 16.4 million people lack basic health care. Medics have struggled to cope with the world's largest cholera outbreak, with more than 1 million suspected cases and 2,248 associated deaths since April 2017. More than 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 2 million who remain displaced.Yemen has become a failed and devastated state.

More than 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 2 million who remain displaced.Key Facts about YemenThree and a half years of conflict have left 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11.3 of which are in acute need. This increase is driven by a deterioration of the situation in key humanitarian sectors.Food Security and Agriculture17.8 million people in Yemen are food insecure. Out of this, approximately 8.4 million people are severely food insecure and at risk of starvation - a worrying increase of 24 per cent. The conflict has destroyed people’s livelihoods and reduced their purchasing power, making it difficult for many Yemenis to meet minimal food needs.HealthWith only 50 per cent of health facilities fully functional, and a disruption of salaries paid to health personnel, 16.4 million people in Yemen require assistance to ensure adequate access to healthcare – 9.3 million of whom are in acute need.The overriding humanitarian need is access to minimum healthcare for people whose lives are at risk due to illness or injury. The latest cholera outbreak has underscored the impact of the failing health system.Water, Sanitation and hygieneAn estimated 16 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to establish or maintain access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene facilities, out of which 11.6 million are in acute need. Collapsing urban water and sanitation systems, deteriorating water and sanitation conditions in rural areas, and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene and purchase safe drinking water all contributed to one of the worst cholera outbreaks.MalnutritionSome 1.8 million children and 1.1 million pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished, including 400,000 children under the age 5 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. An estimated 7.5 million people are in need of nutrition assistance, with 2.9 million people who will require treatment for acute malnutrition in 2017.Shelter and essential itemsAn estimated 5.4 million people need emergency shelter or essential household items, including IDPs, host communities and initial returnees. Ongoing conflict-related displacements, as well as initial returns to some areas, are driving these needs. 2.6 million people are in acute need of assistance.ProtectionWith the increasing conflict, Yemen is one of the world’s largest protection crises. About 12.9 million people need assistance toprotect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of IHL, grave violations of children’s rights and gender-based violence.Displacement and conflict has impacted vulnerable households and persons with specific needs, resulting in negative coping mechanisms and mounting psychosocial support needs. 4.9 million people are living in acutely affected areas.EducationThe 2017/2018 school year started with a setback in the education process in 13 out of 22 governorates. This is due to the extended time of non-payment of salaries for teachers. Schools across the country are unfit for use due to conflict-related damage, hosting of IDPs, or occupation by armed groups. An estimated 4.1 million school-age children require assistance to continue their education.Livelihoods and community resilienceAround 8 million conflict-affected individuals require livelihoods assistance to enhance their selfreliance to address basic needs and reduce dependency on relief assistance. Communities require support to promote resilience, including clearance of landmines and other explosives in up to 22 governorates. SITUATION IN YEMEN IN NUMBERS11.3 millionchildren in need of humanitarian assistance (estimated)22.2 million# of people in need (Periodic Monitoring Review HCT, Apr 2017)1.6 million# of children internally displaced (IDPs) and returnees out of2.9 million# of IDPs and returnees (Task Force on Population Movement 14th report, Protection Cluster, July 2017)460,000children under 5 suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)16 millionPeople in need of WASH assistance16.4 millionPeople in need of basic health care12.9 millionPeople in need of protection6.31 millionWomen who need protectionMore than one millionsuspected cholera cases2.247+people killed by cholera59+people killed by diphtheria About Mona Relief YemenMona Relief is a 100% Yemeni Organization based in Sanaa, Yemen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Paris Palazzo, the founder of 50 Shades of Dark ""Boxed Secrets"". I created this box because I realized how much time and money I was spending while I was in the adult industry on all these products. The initial goal was to provide value to those in the industry by taking out the hassle of mundane shopping and to save money by working directly with the distributors. However, after launching I realized I was the voice of so many others who want to lead an empowered and sexual liberated life. Body positivity is a huge movement and a very important one at that right now as well as a shift in being unashamed of sexuality, and we're proud to be at the forefront of all of this. While representing ALL women who want their voice to be heard, we are also providing high quality products in the most affordable and convenient way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At this time we have launched our first two boxes and are using 15 social influencers each month to promote the box to all their followers. We also just started using a marketing company who is helping promote it with press release and relevant blog topics as well as promoting myself, the founder, to podcasts for interviews.</p>
<p>These efforts are showing already the increase interest and I need to keep this momentum going with equal efforts at minimum but would like to add an expert to the team for advertising via Google, Facebook, and Instagram. In order to do so I need a boost of 50K which would be able to cover these needs for 3 months. After that, if everything is done right we will have enough subscribers that it starts to take care of itself.</p>
<p>15 Influencer's free boxes equates to around 1K a month. The marketing team is 2k/month currently but will go up to 5k/month with their help in advertisement and social media. Then the ad budget itself will be 10k/mo plus the maintenance of the site and all the apps that are integrated it is 500/mo.  With these numbers we will get to the 3 month mark. If we do not hit this goal we will use the money to get the initial efforts in place and do additional fund raising for the rest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a rapidly growing community of individuals who support our core values and are after the same impact. With their support and our efforts we will change the way women are valued and can make their own choices about their bodies. Consumers are already using these products in such quantity it's a billion dollar industry and we add  value by working with the distributor to get better prices that we hand down to our users. We add additional value to many lives by our charitable contributions to organizations that help these specific targeted women. From every box sold we donate $1 to a charity that will help the women we serve and this community as a whole. We have a 'Secret' Crush each month, who is a featured Influencer that we believe is doing their part to help change the way the world sees the modern woman, and their story is told in our newsletter and featured on our social media. </p>
<p>We would love to have contributors who believe in the impact this would have and want to be part of this cultural movement. You may be our target audience already and would enjoy the 'Perks' we can provide here or if not but you'd still like to contribute there's other ways you can help. There is very little out there like this and we feel there's a need. Our box stands out from many other subscription based services because it's very discreet, arriving at your door without some obnoxious message printed on the outside for everyone to see, and also because we offer much higher value in our boxes which is the #1 complaint we saw on reviews of other boxes. Our price point is higher but offers those who are seeking better quality products and more of them the best solution. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One fear is that we don't raise our goal in time and cannot complete all the tasks at hand to achieve the desired results. The alternative would be that we present our ProForma and Presentation to a  group of investors and go the Private Investor route. This would mean we aren't able to allow as many people to try out our product from the incentives that are offered in crowdfunding which also promotes it to a larger audience. </p>
<p>The other thing we have taken into consideration is that not enough people may be willing to pay the Premium price each month for this subscription after all efforts and additional money has gone into the strategy plan. We already have in place a seasonal box for those who can't afford this more frequently but we may have to revise the payment structure and and make it less costly. That would mean not being able to add as much value. It does not mean giving up it just means alternating strategies. There will always be enough people who will still find the value in this box regardless.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot financially support this business venture but believe in the cause and want to see it succeed then we encourage you to sign up on our site for the newsletter, which gives you rewards points, and share it with friends via social media or email which gives you additional rewards points that can be redeemed for future purchases.</p>
<p>You can also use Indiegogo share tools and get the word out this way. We really appreciate your help and support!</p>

<h3>About SAWA Kenya:</h3>
<p>SAWA Kenya is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working in Laikipia County, Central Kenya to improve access to education for young, at-risk girls. SAWA is a Kiswahili word directly translating to ""equal"" or ""the same"" (and more colloquially translating to ""okay""), and in the case of our organization stands for Schooling &amp; Action for Women's Achievement in Kenya. We target girls who have been forced to drop out of primary and secondary school because of early pregnancies, forced marriage and a lack of school fees. Using our network of community contacts, we identify girls who have dropped out of school or are at-risk of dropping out, provide them with 1-on-1 counseling services, and set them up with educational sponsorships to return to school.</p>
<p>We've passed our original goal, but don't let that stop you from donating! Here is what each benchmark amount raised would allow us to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$8,000:</strong> we can send the 17 girls that had their paperwork ready by November back to school for the 2019 school year.</li>
<li>
<strong>$14,000: </strong>we will be able to send the 17 girls back, as well as 11 girls that only recently completed their school registration paperwork. We will also be able to equip all the girls going to boarding school with all the major items recommended by their schools and with additional necessary personal items at the start of each term (x3 per year). </li>
<li>
<strong>$18,000:</strong> we will be able to send all 28 girls back in January, fully equipped for the year, as well as set up the first community educational initiatives during the schools' breaks this April and August.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Need: </h3>
<p>Currently, SAWA Kenya’s focus is on the villages in the II Ngwesi Group Ranch in Laikipia County, Central Kenya. The II Ngwesi Group Ranch villages are made up of primarily Maasai tribes. In the Maasai community, less than 50 percent of girls are enrolled in school and only 10 percent of those girls reach the secondary school level.</p>
<p>Many of the Maasai communities in the II Ngwesi Ranch still practice traditional cultural customs, such as female genital mutilation (""FGM"") and child marriage. A typical Maasai girl undergoes circumcision between the ages of 10-13 and is soon married off to an older man chosen by her father in exchange for sugar, cattle, goats or cash. Girls have no say in their circumcision or in who or when they marry. If a girl is married off, her education is immediately terminated.</p>
<p>Many of the girls growing up in these villages are not allowed to sleep in the same huts as their parents or brothers. It is common for ""warriors,"" older men in the surrounding villages, to approach the girls’ huts at night and rape them. Many Maasai girls are impregnated at early ages by this practice. Girls stay awake late into the night fearful of warriors, rendering them exhausted and unable to concentrate in school the next day.</p>
<p>Unplanned pregnancy is a very common problem among girls throughout these villages. While rape and child marriage are prevalent reasons, the most common cause is simply a lack of understanding or access to family planning. Many girls are impregnated at young ages and with limited financial resources and access to childcare, they are often unable to continue attending school.</p>
<p>Of the girls enrolled in school, many struggle significantly more than their male counterparts. Girls come second to any brothers in the financing of uniforms, school supplies and school fees. Most girls in school don’t have any access to feminine hygiene products. As a result, girls stay home from school during their period, turning to cardboard and other unsanitary options. Girls face innumerable obstacles in attending and staying in school, as their education is not prioritized or valued.</p>
<h3>Our Solution: </h3>
<p>Many of the issues facing our girls are cultural and deeply ingrained. Boarding schools help to eliminate some of these problems by keeping the girls in a safe, education-focused space. SAWA Kenya aims to enroll most of our girls in boarding school and when not possible, we work to provide guidance and support services. We hope to empower our girls through a strong support network devoted to their wellbeing and education.</p>
<p>We believe that you cannot make a lasting change from outside the system, therefore we work very closely with our partners in Kenya to identify girls eligible for sponsorship and come up with the best plan to get them back in school. We also work together to develop longer term goals that will have the greatest impact on the community at large. We maintain daily contact with our partners in the community, and we will provide our sponsors with updates on the girls they support as often as they are available to us. </p>
<p>The challenges these girls face are numerous, complex, and daunting. We have to start somewhere, and we choose to begin by advocating for their education. We plan to support our girls beyond the classroom with additional counseling, mentorship, and workshops to further empower them and equip them with the tools necessary to ensure they can thrive on their own.</p>
<h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Our Team and the Evolution of SAWA:</span></h3>
</div><div>
<p>SAWA Kenya began when Founder &amp; CEO Meg Crampton, a medical student at Frank H. Netter Medical School, went to Kenya to research the driving factors behind the shockingly high dropout rates among female students in the communities of Laikipia County. Meg discovered the massive need for counseling and funding for the girls’ educational aspirations. With many community contacts and an ever-growing list of girls unable to continue their education, Meg returned home and began SAWA Kenya with the ambitious objective to empower girls in these communities through access to education.</p>
<p>Sarah Frear, our President and Director of Finance &amp; Operations, recently moved to Kenya and spent several weeks joining Meg on her initial trips out to the communities in Laikipia County. When Meg decided to found SAWA Kenya, Sarah was more than happy to join the team and continue the work she had witnessed. Sarah brings experience from 3 years at a large multi-national bank and works from the ground in Kenya with Josephine, our Country Director &amp; Field Partner, to oversee and execute day-to-day objectives. </p>
<p>Josephine Ndirias, leader of the local nonprofit Mukogodo Girls Empowerment Program, was integral in helping Meg establish her initial research project and to help develop inroads into the communities. As SAWA Kenya developed from a research project into an operating nonprofit, Josephine became an integral part of our team, helping to coordinate our in-country efforts and to ensure that we are utilizing the best and most efficient methods for helping the girls and their communities. </p>
<p>Kasey Miller, our Grant-Writing &amp; Corporate Sponsorships Volunteer, joined our initiative in the early stages. Bringing her passion and knowledge from time spent working in the nonprofit industry, Kasey helps identify and execute on our fundraising opportunities. </p>
<p>Together Meg, Sarah, Josephine, and Kasey work to identify the girls currently not in school, or at-risk of dropping out, and to get them back in school with scholarships that cover the cost of school fees for one year as well as school supplies and menstrual hygiene kits. Once we have enrolled our 2019 class of girls this January, we will turn our attention to orchestrating workshops in each of the 5 communities we work in to discuss topics such as menstruation, family planning, FGM, and gender violence. </p>
<p>During our initial time in Kenya, we partnered with filmmaker Dakota Lupo and had the opportunity to capture much of the experience and many of the prevalent issues in the communities where we work. We are in the process of putting together a film and hopefully a continuing documentary series which follow these stories. Please enjoy a teaser of the content we have thus far: </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Where Your Donation Goes:</h3>
<p>The first $14,000 raised will be put towards getting our group of 28 girls enrolled in school this January, as well as equipping our 25 girls that are attending boarding programs with the major items recommended by their schools. The $14,000 will be used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The average cost of one school year is $400 for 3 terms.<ul><li>We prioritize sending all of our SAWA girls to return to boarding school where they can better focus on their education without the distractions and pressures of home.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Each girl needs a uniform, including: two dresses ($16), two sweaters ($12), a school bag ($6), socks &amp; shoes ($9), and books &amp; pencils ($8). </li>
<li>Each girl also needs menstrual supplies and only $7 covers the cost of a Days for Girls menstrual hygiene kit. Each kit includes 8 washable and reusable pads, 3 underwear liners, a bar of soap, and 2 plastic bags to safely store unwashed materials. This brings the average cost of basic school materials to ~$60 per year. <ul><li>Girls in Kenya frequently miss school when they are menstruating due to lack of sanitary pads or supplies. We want each of our SAWA girls to have a Days for Girls menstrual hygiene pack providing them with the necessary materials so they don't have to miss school. Plus, this supports an incredible organization based in Chumvi, one of the villages we work in, that sews these reusable kits!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The girls attending boarding school programs will also be provided a mattress, a pillow, a set of sheets, a blanket, a towel, and a trunk for their items -- coming out to an additional ~$40 per girl. Personal items such as soaps, toothbrush and toothpaste, and toilet tissue will also be provided at the start of each term (~$10 per year). This comes out to approximately an additional $50 per year for each of our girls attending boarding programs. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perks: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you purchase one of our $400 perks to sponsor a girl for a year of schooling, we will pair you with a specific girl and, if you wish, pass along updates from her teachers on how she is doing throughout the year.</li>
<li>If you purchase our $100 ""Sponsorship Pool"" perk, your donation will be set aside for the girls that are on our list for the 2020 school year. </li>

<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>The Menstrual Hygiene Project is managed by Community Development Network (CDN) Cameroon, a youth-led, not for profit, apolitical, nongovernmental, humanitarian organization under decree No. 023/RDA/B15/A2/SAAJP, created to support rural development challenges and to promote the aspirations of the poor, vulnerable and marginalized population of Cameroon. </p>
<p>This project targets school-going girls from disadvantaged social and economic backgrounds in selected rural communities in the Northwest, West and Southwest regions of Cameroon. Through our workshops, we will distribute menstrual cups, reusable pads, and period underwear to girls in more than 300 schools, both primary and secondary. </p>
<p>During workshop sessions, we organize training and question-and-answer sessions to give girls a forum where they can ask questions freely and discuss other related topics. Our staff also addresses other hindrances to education these girls face. Through dialogue and education, we aim to empower girls to keep their education as the number one priority.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal of the Menstrual Hygiene Project is to empower girls through menstrual hygiene management to better care for their bodies, answer questions they might have, and keep them in school. Through honest and open dialogue, we equip the girls with the knowledge they need to feel more confident about their bodies. This in turn helps the girls to develop a higher level of self-esteem. </p>
<p>We make a point to challenge the myths and misconceptions that surround puberty and menstruation, and leave the girls with a more solid understanding of their health. We distribute menstrual hygiene supplies along with detailed instructions on how to use and care for each product.</p>
<p>By providing menstrual hygiene supplies, we can reduce absenteeism amongst girls and ensure that their education is never again hindered by their sex.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By using the menstrual hygiene supplies as an entry point upon which to engage girls, we can elaborate on wider issues related to menstrual hygiene and reproductive health. This project also demonstrates how such contact with girls and their communities on a specific issue can be used to promote and develop wider action on issues concerning girls’ health. We also hope to develop better educational outcomes and identify more effective strategies for improving those outcomes moving forward.</p>
<p>In the meantime, our campaign to demystify menstruation will be rolled out at grassroots school levels.

</div></div>","About this Project
The Menstrual Hygiene Project is managed by Community Development Network (CDN) Cameroon, a youth-led, not for profit, apolitical, nongovernmental, humanitarian organization under decree No. 023/RDA/B15/A2/SAAJP, created to support rural development challenges and to promote the aspirations of the poor, vulnerable and marginalized population of Cameroon. 
This project targets school-going girls from disadvantaged social and economic backgrounds in selected rural communities in the Northwest, West and Southwest regions of Cameroon. Through our workshops, we will distribute menstrual cups, reusable pads, and period underwear to girls in more than 300 schools, both primary and secondary. 
During workshop sessions, we organize training and question-and-answer sessions to give girls a forum where they can ask questions freely and discuss other related topics. Our staff also addresses other hindrances to education these girls face. Through dialogue and education, we aim to empower girls to keep their education as the number one priority.
 
What We Need & What You Get
The goal of the Menstrual Hygiene Project is to empower girls through menstrual hygiene management to better care for their bodies, answer questions they might have, and keep them in school. Through honest and open dialogue, we equip the girls with the knowledge they need to feel more confident about their bodies. This in turn helps the girls to develop a higher level of self-esteem. 
We make a point to challenge the myths and misconceptions that surround puberty and menstruation, and leave the girls with a more solid understanding of their health. We distribute menstrual hygiene supplies along with detailed instructions on how to use and care for each product.
By providing menstrual hygiene supplies, we can reduce absenteeism amongst girls and ensure that their education is never again hindered by their sex.
 
The Impact
By using the menstrual hygiene supplies as an entry point upon which to engage girls, we can elaborate on wider issues related to menstrual hygiene and reproductive health. This project also demonstrates how such contact with girls and their communities on a specific issue can be used to promote and develop wider action on issues concerning girls’ health. We also hope to develop better educational outcomes and identify more effective strategies for improving those outcomes moving forward.
In the meantime, our campaign to demystify menstruation will be rolled out at grassroots school levels. We aim to show girls that, when they don’t speak out about the issues they face, they contribute to the silence and stigma around menstruation. Our project encourages them to use their voices, talk about these issues as well as about themselves, and stand up for their rights.
The overriding objective of the project is to ensure the target school girls will not have to miss school simply because they are menstruating. Other objectives are to:
Improve school attendance among girls between the ages of 10- 17 in primary & secondary schools
Increase access of vulnerable adolescent girls to sanitary pads and comprehensive knowledge of menstrual hygiene management
Increase risk awareness of HIV&AIDS among in-school and out of school girls 
Increase the self-esteem of needy girls between ages 10 to 17 years 
Improve economic status for out of young women between 18-34 years

<p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>Introductions </p>
<p>Hello, my name is John. This is my
first time doing this so I'm not all that sure where to begin. I guess I should
start by saying that there are really two stories/introductions here. One is
considerably less relevant and important than the other, so let's start there.
That would be my intro. I am a recent college graduate. I was a high honors, ""A"" student, who
always liked business, and had a gift for numbers. I was born and grew up in
the good old USA, and realize that I am very fortunate. We (Americans) have so
many things that we take for granted. Many will immediately point to things
like electricity, running water, plenty of food, and a good sewage system :).
While that's all true, the things that we are really fortunate to have aren't
really the ""tangible"" amenities at all. It's our freedoms, and our
principles; things such as freedom of religion. While we might disagree in our theology,
or even who is God, we have the freedom to believe/worship as we please without
the fear of death. Neither you nor I would ever try to kill each other over
this.</p>
<p>This leads me to my
""second"" story/ introduction. An article caught my attention a few
days ago it was about a young army veteran who after his tour ended in the Middle
East decided Christians in that part of the world desperately needed help. Instead
of ""looking"" for someone to ""do the helping"" he decided to
do it himself. His name is Brett Felton. He is a Christian who decided that it
was unacceptable to let the ISIS killers murder Christians, crucify children,
rape women, and toss homosexuals off of roof tops. While I am not there, I know
that his militia (the Dweikh Nawsha) has
stood up to ISIS on numerous occasions, and has won (as Brett is still alive
this is a sure sign of victory). They have stood even when their allies ran,
and took all of the heavy weapons with them. </p>
<p>As a fellow believer I believe that
God is on Brett's side, and that is certainly enough for any cause. However, does that
mean we should do nothing, or that we do not have an obligation to act? While
this is definitely a religious issue, I believe it is also a humanitarian
issue. Whether you're a Christian, Muslim, Jew, atheist, or anything else in-between
we should all be able to agree that the things ISIS does on a daily basis are
crimes against humanity, and belong in the dark ages, not in 2015.<span>  </span></p>
<p>So what are we going to do? When
people ask Brett why you he responds with ""Why
not? Why just me? Where’s everyone else at?” This young man is relying on his beliefs,
his faith, his training and skills to do the hard part; shouldn't we at the
very least be supporting him and his brave humanitarian efforts with funding? 

</p><p><b><span>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</span></b></p>
<p>Where does
the money go? I thought about this long and hard, I think the best place is
where we can get the biggest return on each and every penny of your money. For
that reason I have selected 2 places.</p>
<p>1. First,
would be Brett; I will be contacting him directly and offering him part of the
funding. I can't think of anyone who would be better at knowing what needs to
be done, and how to get it done. Furthermore, as he is on the ground doing most
of this on his own time with his own resources, very little of the money would
need to go to ""overhead expenses""; unlike many of the more
traditional charities.</p>
<p>2. The
second would be Mercury One.<span>  It is a
501c3 with a twist. While they are a ""more traditional charity"", they
do special events to pay for their ""overhead expenses"" this way 100%
of the funds they receive throughout the year can be used to assist the desired
cause. I will also be contacting them directly, and providing them with a check
so that there will not be any additional credit card processing fees.</span></p>
<p>In short I
will do my absolute best to be a good steward with the funds that you have
entrusted with me.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>Ok so now the ""fun part"".</p>
<p>I know many of you have families
and other responsibilities, and there are many good causes out there.<span>  Sometimes this makes it difficult to give as
much as each of you would like. While I was still in college I had an idea on
how to help others. Basically, we need to offer something useful that families
use on a daily basis so that the donation money could come from ""household
expenses"" instead of money that was reserved for taking your family out. </span></p>
<p>In 2014 my father and I launched
a company that does just that! We decided to offer laundry products, and have
since added several products including hand soap and dish sop to our line. We
are authorized distributors of all products that we have listed as perks, so if
there are any question/concerns or special requests please email me, and I will
do my best to help you.</p>
<p>I have set up several ""rewards""
categories"" (listed below), and would be happy to add more if you require
it.<span>  We want to help, and will be
providing the products for what it costs us to get them from the
manufactur! This will insure that as much of your donation as possible will go
to help those who need your help so desperately.

</span></p><p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Indigogo wants me to tell each of you what a
difference your donation will make. It's true your donation will have an
impact, how much of one is really up to each of you. The more funds we can
raise the more aid and humanitarian supplies we can provide. While one donation
is greatly appreciated, a bigger impact can be made by getting the word out. Will
you share this on social media? Will you bring it up at church? Are you a
member of other organizations that could do a ""group buy""? </p>
<p>I believed
that our success is only limited by our own imagination, determination, and
willingness to work hard.<span>  How far will
you go? </span></p>
<p>That is the
only true way of defining our success, and answering what kind of an impact we
will have.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>For this fundraiser this section is
almost ironic. What do we risk? Failure? If we fail, they are no worse off than
they are now, and we will still be able to go hug our loved ones and be
""secure"".</p>
<p>The challenge is success, and that can
only be measured by you. Each person that cares and decides to act is a small
victory.<span>  As we stand and work together,
we will succeed. </span></p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier most of this
campaigns success rests with each of you, and donating is one of many things
you can do. The internet is an amazing tool that provides each of us with the
ability to become the media. We can advertise, advocate, share, and communicate
in way that past generations could only dream about so get the word out there;
spread this on social media, or through emails ( I am also suppose to remind
you about Indy Go Go share tools). You can also bring this up at church
meetings, or anywhere else that has a group that is willing to listen. Since we
are a distributor, I have access to an unlimited quantity of our products, so
if you happen to be a member of a million member mega-church, or if you just
want to go door to door (Girl Scout style) we can handle it.</p>
<p>And remember, you are only limited
by your imagination, determination, and
willingness to work hard.<span>  The success of
this campaign rests with you</span></p>

need at least £2,000,000 - but to buy it we will need £600,000. Every Pound,
Dollar or Euro counts.
If you would like to see this building on Google Maps, please look for Isle
of Grain and look into a Thames Estuary (coordinates 51.45168, 0.73125).  Our long term plans: We would like to create a unique combination of research facilities and public attraction. Our research would mainly focus on one of the most important issues faced by this generation - changes to our climate. Nevertheless we would keep the facility open to public with no admission charge. In a long term we would like to create a chain of similar centres which would serve local communities as well as the researchers (all data would be made publicly accessible). Yes, we realise the ambition of our plans - but at the same time, we believe that the valueu of this project speaks for itself, and if successful - it will benefit everybody, therefore it's worth every effort!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It is, of course, not only about the responsibility of Congolese actors, such as the government in that country and the armed gangs, but also about the responsibility of Western states, international organisations and transnational corporations.” Wolfgang Kaleck, founder of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) and jury member of the Congo Tribunal (GER)

(dpa/picture-alliance/Jörg Carstensen)
 
“The Congo Tribunal” is an urgent and necessary project. It is urgent because it allows us to rehabilitate parts of our humanity by giving a voice to those whose rights have been violated. It is necessary because, in the absence of national and international justice, only a public discussion will advance the urgent political debate on the responsibility of transnational corporations for human rights.” Chantal Peyer, Head of the “Business and Human Rights” department, Bread for all

<h3>When life hands you lemons, make blankets! </h3>
<p>I want to make blankets for the homeless so that no one will have to be cold and lonely. I know that I cant save the world but I do want to make a difference in the sphere of people that are around me. </p>
<p>My name is Jackie Russell and I came up with this idea to make blankets for the homeless a few weeks ago after I had a life altering summer. I was really going through a time where I wanted encouragement and support. I just wanted to know that I was loved and supported by the people around me. While I was in this state of mind, I came across a few people who happened to be homeless and were asking me for help. I didn't have any money at the time so I felt completely hopeless in this situation but I did want to help. All I could think was that I may not be able to offer money right now to help but I can offer my talents to help. </p>
<p>That moment birthed this campaign to make blankets for the homeless. With the simple gesture of offering someone a blanket in the cold, I believe it can show that love and support. <strong>I just want to show the homeless people in my area that they are loved and cared for.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>All I really need is a donation of $5 in order to make this idea a reality. </strong></h2>
<p>So this is the breakdown of the cost. </p>
<p><strong>I will be making 15 - 20 chunky blankets starting in September till the end of November to give to the homeless of my city.</strong> I have decided to use the most cost effective brand (to my knowledge) of chunky yarn for the blankets and that is <strong>Bernat Blanket Yarn</strong>. (The link for the yarn that I will be purchasing is: <a href=""http://www.hobbylobby.com/Yarn-Needle-Art/Yarn/Vintage-White-Blanket-Yarn/p/80659199"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.hobbylobby.com/Yarn-Needle-Art/Yarn/...</a>) </p>
<p>This yarn is about <strong>$5</strong> a skein and the yarn weight is a 6 so it is classified as super bulky. I will be making blankets the size of a normal throw blanket, which will call for <strong>12 skeins</strong> of the Bernat. </p>
<p>1 Blanket: 12 skeins x $5 = $60</p>
<p>10 Blankets: $60 x 10 = $600</p>
<p>15 Blankets: $60 x 15 = $900</p>
<p>20 Blankets: $60 x 20 = $1,200</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What will a blanket do? </h3>
<p>Your contribution will give someone who is living on the street a since of warm and home in the upcoming colder months.</p>
<p>I know that this is a hard concept to grasp the impact of giving to someone who is crocheting blankets for the homeless but I think about it like this... if I was on the street and if someone came to me and gave me a blanket that they made just because they wanted to show me love, it would warm my heart to know that someone cares. </p>
<p>That is what I am trying to do. Simple enough. I want to show that I care.</p>
<p><strong>It is less about the blankets but it is more about showing people that they are loved, accepted and cared for.</strong> It is about showing people love during this holiday season when they may not have family or friends around them. </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The world is moving to digital currencies. It is the future of money. In this new digital world, governments and corporations intend to track every transaction to supplement all the other information they collect about us. There are many reasons to be concerned about these developments. In this cashless society and the social credit system, anyone could be punished for not playing by the rules, including being completely banned from the system. Without access to this system, such a person would not even be able to beg for money on the street. And that is just one of many terrors of this dystopian nightmare that is awaiting us. It is unavoidable unless We The People create our own digital money. If not, we will lose our privacy and freedom.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p><h3>What Is Money</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cryptocurrencies were created to compete against the fiat money. However, with over a decade after the invention of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are no closer to producing functional money. Clearly, cryptocurrencies have a fundamental problem that prevents them from being adapted in the economy. The reason is that the cryptocurrency enthusiasts insist a cryptocurrency like bitcoin is money because it is a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. While bitcoin undoubtedly has these properties, they are derivative properties, not definitional properties.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Money is defined by the relationship between money and goods, where: <i>“Goods are wealth which you have, while money is a claim on wealth which you do not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt.”</i> Money is a debt obligation, a type of security best-known as a note, such as the Federal Reserve Note.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since money is a security, and commerce requires securities to operate, explains why cryptocurrencies failed as money.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p><h3>Equitable Money</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If debt is money and it is the type of money we have, then something else must be the problem, and if we don’t fix it, then switching to a different type of money by itself will not help.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem is that we have two economies. A productive economy that produces everything, and the unproductive economy of the financial sector that speculates in the financial markets. Money created for the productive economy is used to produce goods and services. While money created for the financial sector is used to extract money out of the productive economy. At the same time, the financial sector has expanded over the last 100 years from 5% of the GDP to over 50%. Moreover, the financial sector misuses the power of money creation for its own benefit. For example, the central banks are now using the QE program to rescue the banking system by creating enormous amounts of money at the expense to the productive economy.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">If money were issued as debt to the productive economy, then there would be no such problems. But asking the financial sector to get out of the business of money is a nonstarter.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

</div><h3>Axio Monetary System</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The <a href=""https://axios.foundation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Axios Foundation</a> is developing an independent monetary system based on diametrically opposite principles to the current system, such as public control and transparency for <a href=""https://blog.axios.foundation/2020/05/cryptocurrency-for-common-good_8.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">common good</a> instead of secrets for private gains. It would be able to function within the global economy and able to compete against the fiat money. It would be a real revolution against the establishment, and it is already under way. It is called the <a href=""https://blog.axios.foundation/2019/03/axio-monetary-system.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Axio Monetary System</a>.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The system will be operated by the Foundation in a similar way to a credit union, which is a financial cooperative controlled by its members as stakeholders, and operated on the principle of people helping people. The System will be based on a cryptocurrency called <a href=""https://blog.axios.foundation/2019/04/axio-as-money.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Axio</a> that will be issued by the Foundation and will be held in accounts managed by the Foundation. All axios will be issued as Axio-denominated loans. Each Axio will be created as a loan and will be destroyed when it is paid out. This process of creation and destruction of the Axio will be secured with a blockchain. Consequently, the amount of Axio in circulation will be able to expand and contract in proportion to the demand for the Axio, while assuring that the Axio is fully backed by the full faith and credit of the borrowers. That is, the Axio will be directly backed by the intrinsic value of work that represents the real value rather than a by-product of work such as gold. And unlike commodity-backed cryptocurrencies that have a fractional reserve value, the Axio will be fully backed by the full faith and credit of the borrowers.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The System will include a bank, a currency exchange, and a dispute resolution system. These institutions will provide the minimum required to allow the Axio to function within the economy. The System will provide services such as payment methods that will support free real-time transactions, enabling the Axio to compete against other currencies. All this will give the Axio many advantages over other cryptocurrencies, including a stable intrinsic value that does not depend on other currencies or commodities, free real-time transactions paid for by the interest on loans, legal basis of a security issued under the law, in addition to many other advantages the Axio Monetary System will offer. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Backed by its own monetary system, the Axio can be thought of as a currency of a virtual country, and will be usable just like any other currency via a payment app or a credit card. The Foundation will support business transactions by providing a legal framework supported by dispute resolution. The ability to redress grievances will make the Axio similar to a government-issued legal tender, which is something that no other cryptocurrency can offer. With so much going for it, the Axio is positioned to become a dominant player in the race to create the next generation of money. As such, it has enormous potential.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606863087/bhdepqfm38uyhet0jmee.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3>We The People</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Axio Monetary System could provide a core of a new economy that would serve the people and resist the dystopian future that awaits us.

For this the Foundation issued 100,000,000 Axio Tokens that will be converted into Axio when the Foundation will begin its operations. As a U.S. corporation, the Foundation is required to raise funds in accordance with the SEC regulations. As a result, the Axio Tokens are only available to accredited investors, which effectively excludes the majority of people.

It is the future of money. In this new digital world, governments and corporations intend to track every transaction to supplement all the other information they collect about us. There are many reasons to be concerned about these developments. In this cashless society and the social credit system, anyone could be punished for not playing by the rules, including being completely banned from the system. Without access to this system, such a person would not even be able to beg for money on the street. And that is just one of many terrors of this dystopian nightmare that is awaiting us. It is unavoidable unless We The People create our own digital money. If not, we will lose our privacy and freedom. What Is MoneyCryptocurrencies were created to compete against the fiat money. However, with over a decade after the invention of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are no closer to producing functional money. Clearly, cryptocurrencies have a fundamental problem that prevents them from being adapted in the economy. The reason is that the cryptocurrency enthusiasts insist a cryptocurrency like bitcoin is money because it is a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. While bitcoin undoubtedly has these properties, they are derivative properties, not definitional properties.Money is defined by the relationship between money and goods, where: “Goods are wealth which you have, while money is a claim on wealth which you do not have. Thus goods are an asset; money is a debt.” Money is a debt obligation, a type of security best-known as a note, such as the Federal Reserve Note.Since money is a security, and commerce requires securities to operate, explains why cryptocurrencies failed as money. Equitable MoneyIf debt is money and it is the type of money we have, then something else must be the problem, and if we don’t fix it, then switching to a different type of money by itself will not help.The problem is that we have two economies. A productive economy that produces everything, and the unproductive economy of the financial sector that speculates in the financial markets. Money created for the productive economy is used to produce goods and services. While money created for the financial sector is used to extract money out of the productive economy. At the same time, the financial sector has expanded over the last 100 years from 5% of the GDP to over 50%. Moreover, the financial sector misuses the power of money creation for its own benefit. For example, the central banks are now using the QE program to rescue the banking system by creating enormous amounts of money at the expense to the productive economy.If money were issued as debt to the productive economy, then there would be no such problems. But asking the financial sector to get out of the business of money is a nonstarter. 

 
Axio Monetary SystemThe Axios Foundation is developing an independent monetary system based on diametrically opposite principles to the current system, such as public control and transparency for common good instead of secrets for private gains. It would be able to function within the global economy and able to compete against the fiat money. It would be a real revolution against the establishment, and it is already under way. It is called the Axio Monetary System.The system will be operated by the Foundation in a similar way to a credit union, which is a financial cooperative controlled by its members as stakeholders, and operated on the principle of people helping people.

<p>The Indiegogo online donating period has come to an end, but you can still donate by sending a cheque made out to 'Clynfyw CIC' and sent to - Jim Bowen, Clynfyw Farm, Abercych, Boncath, SA37 0HF. Thanks.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Over
the past month people in Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and
across south Wales have been collecting items to send to refugees in
Europe. A 20ft container full of tents, sleeping bags, clothes and 
toiletries left west Wales for the Greek island of Kos on Friday October
 the 2nd. The container will arrive with the charity 'Kos Kindness​' 
before the end of the month. The donated items will then be distributed 
to the 100's of refugees who are arriving on the island daily.  We will 
also donate the container
itself, as a lack of storage has been a major problem for them over
the past few weeks.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>To do
this we need to raise around £5,000. We are organising concerts (Carmarthen 03/10/15 - raised £809) (Llandysul, 04/10/15 raised £340), we will be packing bags at Tesco (17/10/15) and Morrisons (TBC) to raise funds, and a local group has already pledged money (Coda Ni, £1,000), but we also need <b>your support</b> so that we can pay for this 1st container, and hopefully send another one in the future. Any donation
will be greatly appreciated. <br/></p>

update you with pictures and more information here and on our

<h3>Kos Kindness<br/>
</h3>
<span>""As
many will be aware there is a great influx of refugees arriving on the Island
on a daily basis and Kos Kindness has extended its support to ensure that as
much help as is possible is given to the families and children arriving. We distribute, baby food, baby wipes, sanitary items, food, baby
child and adult clothing and shoes and basic need requirements such as
toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, back packs pop up tents, sleeping bags
etc. as well as passing out toys for the children who have landed on our Island
with nothing. A smile when a teddy is passed over is a joy to behold.</span> We are a registered charity in Greece. You can follow our work

</div>","Important 
The Indiegogo online donating period has come to an end, but you can still donate by sending a cheque made out to 'Clynfyw CIC' and sent to - Jim Bowen, Clynfyw Farm, Abercych, Boncath, SA37 0HF. Thanks.

Background
Over
the past month people in Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and
across south Wales have been collecting items to send to refugees in
Europe. A 20ft container full of tents, sleeping bags, clothes and 
toiletries left west Wales for the Greek island of Kos on Friday October
 the 2nd. The container will arrive with the charity 'Kos Kindness​' 
before the end of the month. The donated items will then be distributed 
to the 100's of refugees who are arriving on the island daily.  We will 
also donate the container
itself, as a lack of storage has been a major problem for them over
the past few weeks.

   What We Need 
To do
this we need to raise around £5,000. We are organising concerts (Carmarthen 03/10/15 - raised £809) (Llandysul, 04/10/15 raised £340), we will be packing bags at Tesco (17/10/15) and Morrisons (TBC) to raise funds, and a local group has already pledged money (Coda Ni, £1,000), but we also need your support so that we can pay for this 1st container, and hopefully send another one in the future. Any donation
will be greatly appreciated. 
We will
update you with pictures and more information here and on our
Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/WalesSupportsRefugees
Kos Kindness

""As
many will be aware there is a great influx of refugees arriving on the Island
on a daily basis and Kos Kindness has extended its support to ensure that as
much help as is possible is given to the families and children arriving. We distribute, baby food, baby wipes, sanitary items, food, baby
child and adult clothing and shoes and basic need requirements such as
toothbrushes, toothpaste, shampoo, soap, back packs pop up tents, sleeping bags
etc. as well as passing out toys for the children who have landed on our Island
with nothing. A smile when a teddy is passed over is a joy to behold. We are a registered charity in Greece. You can follow our work

Thanks for your
support.

<p>My name is Brian. I am an ex-soldier and Federal Agent; an organised crime operations specialist. (I am the guy who strips on stage in the video for this campaign).</p>
<p>For around 17 years I have been working on counter-slavery operations around the world. In this time, I have been to dozens of countries and seen the faces of the trafficked and enslaved making the things we buy; the teenagers on fishing boats, the children (and toddlers!) in mines and plantations, the women and girls in factories stitching our clothes. And we have all seen tragedies like Rana Plaza which should never have happened.</p>
<p>More than 90% of slavery is in the private sector; owned by big business. And they exist because we buy their stuff.</p>
<p>That's 10s of millions of children, teeangers, women, and men. I started slavefreetrade to end slavery in supply chains; that is where we find about 80% of all slavery today.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help get slavefreetrade up and running. You can help us free 45 million people in modern slavery.</p>
<p>Your contributions get us operational. You help us get in the blockchain and other advanced tech needed, bring in the staff needed, and put it all together as working programmes, to get slaves liberated.</p>
<p>You help us get slave-free labelling onto products in stores so that we, the consumer, can start telling business how we want our things made.</p>
<p>We have hurdles in front of us, of course. Not the least of which is big business (much of which is strongly against our form of transparency). And, of course, slavers don't want us doing what we are doing. But we don't scare that easily.</p>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially, or want to help in other ways, take a look at these ideas:</p>
<p>1) Get the word out and make some noise about slavefreetrade. The stronger the movement behind slavefreetrade, the more liberating our impact.</p>
<p>2) Ask the stores where you shop if they stock certified slave-free. If they don't, tell them that is what you want of the things you buy.</p>
<p>3) Join us! All volunteers are very, very welcome to help improve our programmes, and to spread the word.</p>

<p>Where We Are Going</p>
<p>The Hult Prize is an international start-up accelerator that brings together the brightest college and university students from around the globe to solve today’s most pressing social problems. This year's competition is focused on the global refugee crisis and challenges students like us to think critically and creatively about unlocking the human potential of refugees throughout their journeys. As a result, thousands of teams have competed both domestically and abroad to secure spots in one of the five regional competitions. As the winning team from William &amp; Mary's local competition, we earned a spot in the San Francisco regional competition in March.</p>
<p>While in San Francisco, we hope to present our business plan. Our business model would allow us to digitally connect refugees to resources while they are on the move, and work with them to increase their employability upon arrival in a third country or country of resettlement, all while functioning as a profitable business venture. We have used the interdisciplinary academic, extracurricular, and professional experience of our team to inform our business strategy and social impact plan. We cannot wait to present in San Francisco to a group of esteemed judges and extremely qualified peers.</p>
<p>What We Need</p>
<p>In order to present at the regional competition, however, we must travel to and stay in San Francisco for several nights. As full time students, the expense of the trip is well above our budgets. Although we were told that the trip was originally funded through our business program, due to administrative lack of communication, we were left with an abundance of hope but zero funding. We have estimated that the cost of travel, housing, and basic necessities while we are in San Francisco will total only $3,500 for our whole team. As we move closer and closer to the competition dates, every cent counts.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate at this time, but know of folks who are, please share our story! And if you know of resources available to us in San Francisco, please let us know! We accept words of encouragement and restaurant recommendations too!</p>

<p>Freeset is a fair trade business offering employment to women who are trapped in Kolkata's sex trade. We make quality jute bags and organic cotton t-shirts, but our business is freedom. </p>
<p>Freeset seeks to buy the  <a href=""http://freesetglobal.com/gateway-project.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gateway Building</a> situated at the entrance to Sonagacchi - India's most infamous sex district. This 20,000 square foot will give more women and girls the opportunity to choose freedom from prostitution, as we expand our capacity and support the growth of new freedom businesses. </p>
<ul>
<li>Sex slavery is a growing problem in our world, and India's sex trade is booming. </li>
<li>Freeset is addressing this problem, but to do more <b>we need your help.</b>
</li>
<li>In helping, you become part of the freedom story—offering women in the sex trade an alternative source of employment, thereby reducing the economic issues that lead to young girls being sold or tricked into the sex trade industry. </li>
</ul>

<p>In 1999, Kerry and Annie Hilton left New Zealand to move to Kolkata with a very broad goal: to help the poor and the needy. After naively leasing an apartment right beside Sonagacchi, their goal became much clearer: to give women forced into prostitution by trafficking and poverty the <i>choice </i>of freedom.</p>
<p>Once in the sex trade, women have little or no hope of leaving it or earning their freedom. Society has labeled them unclean—outcasts. </p>
<p>The women and girls desperately needed an alternate source of income. The Hilton's realized that by training the women with new skills they could start a business that would provide sustainable employment <b>and</b> a path to freedom. This was the beginning of Freeset.</p>

</div></div>","The Gateway Campaign Continues!  This is a global campaign and donations can be accepted at www.freesetgateway.com.  Thanks for your support!

Freeset is a fair trade business offering employment to women who are trapped in Kolkata's sex trade. We make quality jute bags and organic cotton t-shirts, but our business is freedom. 
Freeset seeks to buy the  Gateway Building situated at the entrance to Sonagacchi - India's most infamous sex district. This 20,000 square foot will give more women and girls the opportunity to choose freedom from prostitution, as we expand our capacity and support the growth of new freedom businesses. 

Sex slavery is a growing problem in our world, and India's sex trade is booming. 
Freeset is addressing this problem, but to do more we need your help.

In helping, you become part of the freedom story—offering women in the sex trade an alternative source of employment, thereby reducing the economic issues that lead to young girls being sold or tricked into the sex trade industry. 






In 1999, Kerry and Annie Hilton left New Zealand to move to Kolkata with a very broad goal: to help the poor and the needy. After naively leasing an apartment right beside Sonagacchi, their goal became much clearer: to give women forced into prostitution by trafficking and poverty the choice of freedom.
Once in the sex trade, women have little or no hope of leaving it or earning their freedom. Society has labeled them unclean—outcasts. 
The women and girls desperately needed an alternate source of income. The Hilton's realized that by training the women with new skills they could start a business that would provide sustainable employment and a path to freedom. This was the beginning of Freeset.



You can learn more about Freeset here









Our ultimate goal is $3 Million, but we are breaking it up into 5 steps. As we complete each goal, we become one step closer to helping more women and girls choose freedom from a life of sex slavery. 
Our timeline is very short. The owners of the property will close on the sale by the end of June 2015, so we need to raise $2 Million of our goal by June 30th.  This is a global campaign - with multiple fundraising efforts across the global.  Freeset USA is leading this Indiegogo campaign.  If you would like to make a larger donation via check, please send an email to gateway@freesetglobal.com.





Freeset has already made two down payments on the building.  Step 1 is raising $200,000 to make a 3rd down payment on the Gateway Building. 


Step 2 is raising an additional $200,000, which will allow us to make a 4th down payment on the building. 


At Step 3, we will be over halfway to purchasing the building! 

At Step 4 the building can be purchased and closing costs can be paid. Our team can now begin the necessary renovations on the building. Once the renovations are underway, we can begin to turn the building into a workspace and sanctuary for many hundreds more women. 

Step 5 is raising an additional $700,000, which would push us to the finish line of our $3 Million goal. $200,00 of this will provide for the renovations. The other $500,000 will provide funding for the social services necessary for these women and their families to more fully achieve freedom: healthcare, education, counseling, literacy training, and childcare. 









Your donations to Freeset USA will help fund the acquisition and renovation of the 20,000 square foot Gateway Building as well as provide community services to the women of Sonagacchi. This building will bring an additional 300+ women to sustainable freedom by providing a safe workspace and community. When you take into account the benefits of Freeset’s businesses and social services on the women’s children and extended communities, the true impact will number in the thousands.
Here are some photos that members of our team have taken on their most recent visit to the building.

<p><strong>The story about the Centre for eating disorders BEA</strong></p> <p>Centre BEA is available every day throughout the year to persons suffering from eating disorders and their families. Many sufferers consider Centre BEA as the first step they need to take, and it is the most difficult one.</p> <p>After years of work and experiences in the area of eating disorders, we founded the Centre for eating disorders BEA in 2012 in Zagreb, the Republic of Croatia. Within the scope of our activities, we offer daily support to people suffering from eating disorders and their families, we implement prevention programmes and educate the public via public health projects. Together with experts from Croatia, we have participated in the making of Strategic Guidelines for Improvement of Prevention and Treatment of Eating Disorders in the Republic of Croatia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523011264/r2eftjgzk0wi8p4ctpfa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why did we launch a crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p> <p>During our work so far, we have noticed that the need for our services is unfortunately increasing. Even though it is generally thought that persons with eating disorders are guilty for their problems, it is important to stress out that eating disorders are serious psychological disorders that can leave deep and permanent consequences, both physical and psychological. Therefore, we believe that every person suffering from eating disorders deserves access to timely support and professional help.</p>
<p>We at the Centre BEA make people become visible, make their voice become heard and their problems recognised.</p>
<p>Even though we have been continuously working from 2012, we still lack adequate space in which we would be able to conduct our activities on a daily basis and offer help and support to persons suffering from eating disorders, and their families.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523011342/uzrfab1znbav3h1vbgjr.jpg"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p><strong>How will we spend our funds?</strong></p>
<p>The city of Zagreb provided us with space that needs to be completely adapted and organised for work. In order to achieve our goal we need 20 000 USD and the overall amount of donations will be invested in the construction and decoration of space in which sufferers can continue receiving adequate help and understanding.</p>
<p>Through ongoing activities of the Centre BEA and public lectures, we will continue sharing the awareness about this extremely important social issue that is still not discussed often enough. However, most importantly, we will be available for the people we are here for in the first place – persons suffering from eating disorders.</p>

They feel invisible and isolated. Their voice is not heard. Their problems are not recognised. We at Centre BEA are trying to change that. 


The story about the Centre for eating disorders BEA Centre BEA is available every day throughout the year to persons suffering from eating disorders and their families. Many sufferers consider Centre BEA as the first step they need to take, and it is the most difficult one. After years of work and experiences in the area of eating disorders, we founded the Centre for eating disorders BEA in 2012 in Zagreb, the Republic of Croatia. Within the scope of our activities, we offer daily support to people suffering from eating disorders and their families, we implement prevention programmes and educate the public via public health projects. Together with experts from Croatia, we have participated in the making of Strategic Guidelines for Improvement of Prevention and Treatment of Eating Disorders in the Republic of Croatia.
 

 
Why did we launch a crowdfunding campaign? During our work so far, we have noticed that the need for our services is unfortunately increasing. Even though it is generally thought that persons with eating disorders are guilty for their problems, it is important to stress out that eating disorders are serious psychological disorders that can leave deep and permanent consequences, both physical and psychological. Therefore, we believe that every person suffering from eating disorders deserves access to timely support and professional help.
We at the Centre BEA make people become visible, make their voice become heard and their problems recognised.
Even though we have been continuously working from 2012, we still lack adequate space in which we would be able to conduct our activities on a daily basis and offer help and support to persons suffering from eating disorders, and their families.
 
How will we spend our funds?
The city of Zagreb provided us with space that needs to be completely adapted and organised for work. In order to achieve our goal we need 20 000 USD and the overall amount of donations will be invested in the construction and decoration of space in which sufferers can continue receiving adequate help and understanding.
Through ongoing activities of the Centre BEA and public lectures, we will continue sharing the awareness about this extremely important social issue that is still not discussed often enough. However, most importantly, we will be available for the people we are here for in the first place – persons suffering from eating disorders.

I ja sam tu. Vidiš li me?Stvorimo zajedno sigurno mjesto za oboljele od anoreksije i bulimije.Jeste li znali da su poremećaji hranjenja ozbiljni psihički poremećaji od kojih u Hrvatskoj boluje najmanje 40 000 osoba?Jeste li znali da oko 10% osoba koje boluju od anoreksije umre od posljedica povezanih s bolešću?Jeste li znali da anoreksija ima najveću stopu smrtnosti od svih psihičkih poremećaja?Osobe s poremećajem hranjenja osjećaju krivnju, sram, ljutnju. Osjećaju se nevidljivo i izolirano. Njihov glas se ne čuje. Njihovi problemi nisu prepoznati. A mi iz Centra BEA trudimo se to promijeniti. Priča o Centru za poremećaje hranjenja BEACentar BEA svakog je dana tijekom cijele godine na raspolaganju osobama s poremećajima hranjenja i njihovim obiteljima. Mnogim oboljelim osobama Centar BEA je prva stepenica koju treba prijeći. Ujedno i ona najteža.Nakon višegodišnjeg rada i iskustva u području poremećaja hranjenja, 2012. godine osnovali smo Centar za poremećaje hranjenja BEA u Zagrebu, Hrvatska. U sklopu naših aktivnosti svakodnevno pružamo podršku oboljelima od poremećaja hranjenja i njihovim obiteljima, provodimo preventivne programe i educiramo javnost putem javno zdravstvenih projekata. Zajedno sa stručnjacima iz Hrvatske, sudjelovali smo u izradi Strategijskih smjernica za unaprijeđenje prevencije i liječenje poremećaja hranjenja u Hrvatskoj. Zašto smo pokrenuli crowdfunding kampanju?Tijekom dosadašnjeg rada, primijetili smo kako je potreba za našim radom, nažalost, sve veća. Iako postoji uvriježeno mišljenje kako su osobe s poremećajem hranjenja same krive za svoje poteškoće, važno je istaknuti kako su poremećaji hranjenja ozbiljan psihički poremećaj koji može ostaviti duboke i trajne posljedice, kako fizičke tako i psihičke. Stoga vjerujemo da svaka osoba oboljela od poremećaja hranjenja zaslužuje pristup pravovremenoj podršci i stručnoj pomoći.Mi u Centru BEA omogućujemo osobama da postanu vidljive, da se njihov glas čuje i da njihovi problemi budu prepoznati.Iako djelujemo kontinuirano od 2012. godine i dalje nam nedostaje adekvatan prostor gdje bismo svakodnevno provodili svoje aktivnosti i pružali pomoć i podršku osobama koje boluju od poremećaja hranjenja i njihovim obiteljima. Na što ćemo utrošiti sredstva?Od Grada Zagreba dobili smo prostor kojeg treba u potpunosti adaptirati, prilagoditi i urediti za rad.

The farm will offer safety, shelter, and vocational opportunities for the street girls who currently work as community sexual workers in Nairobi. The girls will grow vegetables to sell for market. Girl's Town has already been guaranteed that all produce grown will be purchased.  Your investment is to start the project, the revenue already guaranteed will sustain it. Profits will be reinvested to purchase more land and equipment to expand the farm and save more girls. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Girls Town is being founded by Marianne Stevenson who is President and Founder of AERObridge, a U.S. nonprofit organization which has been working in Kenya for 4 years. AERObridge is a US-based 501(c)3 nonprofit organization which utilizes donated cargo space to efficiently move donations and respond to needs in areas affected by humanitarian crises and disasters. Since 2012, AERObridge has partnered with individuals, orphanages, and schools in Kenya to provide basic necessities and school supplies for children in need. </p><p>It was through one of these partners that the idea for Girls Town Kenya Hydroponic Farm was born. In June 2016, the director of New Horizon Boys Orphanage told Marianne about some girls who were living in the Mathare slum of Nairobi who were not in school and in danger as adolescent females.  Two of the girls had families but could not afford food, much less school.  Searching the slums for food would eventually lead to beatings and rape.  The only safe solution was to find sponsorship for boarding schools. Within months, Marianne secured enough donations to pay for a year’s tuition for the girls. </p><p>One of the girls identified at this same time had no family, Mercy was a street girl. The unspeakable horrors of life as a community sexual worker on the streets of Nairobi had left her virtually unable to operate within the confines of a traditional educational system so boarding school was not an option. Marianne arranged for counseling for her, but eventually it became evident that she needed an alternative to school.  She needed a vocation. </p><p> </p><p><strong>The Project</strong></p><p>Girls Town will be that vocation. The Farm will provide an opportunity for Mercy, and others like her, to live and learn in a safe environment. The girls will learn about farming and grow vegetables to sell on the market. The farm will be financially self-sustaining, with profits from the sales going to cover the girls’ wages, ongoing operating costs, and eventually to purchase more land, allowing us to help more girls. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p><p>Help us provide this life-changing opportunity to Nairobi’s street girls. Your funds will be used to purchase the infrastructure and provide critical services that will allow these girls to successfully leave the street life behind.

I must say I am incredibly proud of my son, he rolled with everything without a single complaint. <br/>We started our day by going to one of the roughest slums called Mathare Slum. We were met by one of my colleagues who lives and works with the street children. We got the privilege to meet Mercy, one of young ladies in the video. She was one of the main reasons I became interested in beginning a female only hydroponic farm for street girls. Abandoned at ten by her mother, she had to survive on the streets. When I asked her the worst part of the streets, she said ""eating out of the dustbins (trash)"". She also commented that she didn't like being alone. Having survived rapes and years of prostitution, those were her thoughts. </p><p>We walked the slums, hopping over squishy mud puddles, sometimes with no way to avoid just stepping in the 3 inch thick mud. We went to where the children sleep, a square area about the size of the park opposite my villa. Only, this area is used for trash, so they sleep on it. As my colleague introduced us to all the children, she introduced us to Faith. She is another street girl. I was told that last month, 4 men raped her. She doesn't want to talk about it, even with my colleague, as she says she is ""already healed."" The simple fact is that on the streets, it wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last. </p><p>We continued on, creating quite the parade of street children and other children all vying to hold our hands. My son held hands, talked with all the kids and picked his way through the muddy streets without the slightest indication that there was anything alien to him about the world they live in. </p><p>After our walk, we went back to the mission where the priest in charge asked me when the farm would be able to take Mercy, as she cannot stay any longer. He said she was only supposed to stay one night, and it has been a year. She is only part time at the mission and the strain of the situation was clear in the priests voice. Currently in the slums, the locals are putting rat poison in the food and giving it to the street children. One boy woke up to 5 of his friends being dead. The streets are so unsafe for these children. </p><p>We gave out some gifts of toiletries, pillows, stuffed toys and departed to look at land options for Girl's Town. We drove for 2 hours but covered a short distance. Between traffic and bad roads, it took a while to get to the area with land. We looked at housing options and land until evening. We even encountered a 2 year old that would not stop wailing at the sight of 4 white people. He thought the ""mazunga"" (white person) was there to eat him. I am serious! </p><p>Then after a long day, we went to have dinner which was the first food since breakfast. We were all tired and went back to the hotel to sleep. My son never complained a bit. <br/> </p></div>","Features Perks:    What is Girls Town?Girls Town Kenya Hydroponic Farm will be a for profit, female only, hydroponic farm on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya.

As my colleague introduced us to all the children, she introduced us to Faith. She is another street girl. I was told that last month, 4 men raped her. She doesn't want to talk about it, even with my colleague, as she says she is ""already healed."" The simple fact is that on the streets, it wasn't the first time, and it won't be the last. We continued on, creating quite the parade of street children and other children all vying to hold our hands. My son held hands, talked with all the kids and picked his way through the muddy streets without the slightest indication that there was anything alien to him about the world they live in. After our walk, we went back to the mission where the priest in charge asked me when the farm would be able to take Mercy, as she cannot stay any longer. He said she was only supposed to stay one night, and it has been a year. She is only part time at the mission and the strain of the situation was clear in the priests voice. Currently in the slums, the locals are putting rat poison in the food and giving it to the street children. One boy woke up to 5 of his friends being dead. The streets are so unsafe for these children. We gave out some gifts of toiletries, pillows, stuffed toys and departed to look at land options for Girl's Town. We drove for 2 hours but covered a short distance. Between traffic and bad roads, it took a while to get to the area with land. We looked at housing options and land until evening. We even encountered a 2 year old that would not stop wailing at the sight of 4 white people. He thought the ""mazunga"" (white person) was there to eat him. I am serious! Then after a long day, we went to have dinner which was the first food since breakfast. We were all tired and went back to the hotel to sleep. My son never complained a bit.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Refugeehelpapp urgently seeks your help in providing
refugees and the helping volunteers with an essential app and database that will help refugees
to feel home faster and saves a lot of time for all involved volunteers. You
can make a direct impact on a refugee life and on the volunteers by
contributing to our initiative.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Refugeehelpapp will help aid those who
have left everything behind. They arrive in refugee camps and it is our
intention to get them all local information they need with our app, so that
they can feel home faster and have a chance of fast integration into the
community.</p>
<p>All it takes is one person to start
changing the world, and it can start with you!</p>
<p>All donations will be used directly for
the development of an app and a database that contains all local
informations. </p>
<p>We are a volunteer group who have united
together from across the globe with one common goal of aiding Syrian refugees
families in Europe in the beginning and to expand that worldwide if the
contributions are higher than the current need. </p>
<p>Refugeehelpapp
is still seeking local volunteers, as a first step in Germany, who will help
locally with the input of data (doctors, supermarkets, mosques etc.). It’s a
mere 20min of work per refugee camp and will save you hours per day in the
future!!! If you would like to help us, please send an email to <a href=""mailto:social@refugeehelpapp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social@refugeehelpapp.com</a>. Thank
you!</p>

<b>Current Situation</b>
<p>Germany is in crisis
mode. Every day trains packed with refugees arrive from the south, and despite
tightened border controls, as many as a 1.5 million are expected by the end of
the year. For all the warm and open talk coming from Chancellor Angela Merkel,
everyone knows that the financial and social costs of absorbing so many people
will be considerable.</p>
<p>Germany and its
less-welcoming European partners are treating the wave of refugees primarily as
a humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The largest group of
migrants entering Europe through Turkey and Greece and coming via Hungary,
Croatia and Austria to Germany are Syrians, followed by Iraqis and Afghans,
according to the United Nations refugee agency. Those who are fleeing war zones
have a strong claim to being refugees, rather than economic migrants.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands
of people have arrived on Europe's shores since January, more than 3,400 have
drowned and the death toll is rising quickly with the worsening weather. Just
last week, he said, there were 13 shipwrecks off the coast of Greece and over
150 people died or are missing, including dozens of children.</p>
<p>Last year, more than
23,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in the 28 member countries of
the European Union, according to the United Nations. That was before the number
of refugees surged this year. By now, 30,000 are estimated to live in Germany
alone. Most of them lost their parents to war or murder at home.</p>
<p>To receive asylum, a
migrant must show “a well-founded fear of persecution” in the country he or she
fled on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, political conviction or
membership in a social group. If that person is coming from a war zone like
Syria, it can be easier to make that case.</p>
<p>The situation in
Europe is only a smaller piece of the overall crisis. Countries in the Middle
East that border Syria or Iraq, where conflict has displaced millions over
several years, have accepted many more refugees than Europe. Asylum seekers in
Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are expected to increase by almost a million in
2015, reaching <span>4.7 million </span>by December.</p>
<p>But what is happening
right now is just the tip of the iceberg. The combined resources of U.N.
agencies, the Red Cross and humanitarian organizations are no longer enough to
protect the 60 million people displaced by war and persecution around the
world, the U.N. refugee chief said Nov 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2015. In the coming
years there will be more and more people coming from the southern hemisphere to
the north based upon climate change.</p>
<p>All of that is not a
European problem, this is a problem that will affect everyone else in the
northern hemisphere over the next few years.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447941617/bddkcanvtmdutpgvln9a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>The Challenge</b>
<p>There are 1.5 million refugees in Germany. Rough estimations are, that
approx. 150,000 people helping them in the refugee centers. By working in 2
shifts this means that per volunteer there are 20 refugees that need support.</p>
<p>The local volunteers in the refugee camps are overwhelmed by questions
like</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where is the next supermarket where I can buy halal food?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where can I get Wi-Fi connection?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where is the local government office?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where is a playground for the kids?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where do I get warm clothes for the winter?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where do I find the next doctor?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where do I find a local Muslim center?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Where do I find a mosque?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>and many, many more…</p>
<p>Now let assume that 1 refugee asks 1 question a day that takes 5 minutes
to solve.</p>
<p>1.5 million refugee questions a day mean 7,500,000 minutes (125,000
hours) a day, just answering questions.</p>
<p>Let assume that those
refugees are awake 16 hours a day. This would mean that round about 7,813
volunteers/helpers are doing nothing else than answering simple questions a day.</p>
<p>From a pure cost perspective if the helpers would be paid by minimum wage (approx. 9.50$)<br/></p>
<p>7,813 helpers, lets assume a value of 9.50$/hr x 16 hours/day = savings of  1,187,576$ 
per day = 
    433,465,240$ 
per year.... with one app and database...</p>
<p>Means donations that the humanitarian organizations get, can be used for other things than answering simple questions!<br/></p>
<p>There are approx.
150,000 volunteers/helpers from humanitarian organizations in the camps in
Germany alone. Most of them are simply overwhelmed by the work that needs to be
done other than answering questions. Lots of them are working 12-14 hours a
day, for free, just to help.</p>
<p>There are several
apps already on the market. All of them solve one or another issue, but there
is no complete solution for all major issues and the refugees are not picking
up on those apps, as it is too confusing.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>We have a tremendous amount of local campaigns going on in Germany. Means, there is a lot of traction.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448287649/umgwawsqkunxnhofhyrp.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 319.761px; height: 365px;""/></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>The Solution</b></p>
<p>By talking to a lot
of volunteers we got the impression that our app would help them dramatically
in saving a lot of time and would help the refugees a lot to feel free in
finding the right destinations.</p>
<p>In addition to that,
millions of people in Germany are giving away clothes, toys for kids, groceries
and so on, to help the refugees.</p>
<p>The challenge is,
that no one knows what is needed in which camp. Our app will also solve that.
Volunteers can put in the most needed items in their camp into the app, so that
people who would like to give, know exactly what is needed and where it is needed.</p>
<p>Volunteers will be
able to log in into a dashboard via mobile or PC and type in their local data
for their camp and put in all the information is needed, regarding questions or
things that are desperately needed.</p>
<p>The app will display
all information per camp for refugees, volunteers and people that will give
things for free. Means everyone will be happy and everyone saves a lot of time
to do more effective work other than just answering simple questions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks and hurdles<br/></b></p>
<p>Refugeehelpapp is deeply saddened by the recent
events in Paris. The refugees we are working so hard to help are the victims of
these same terrorists and it is truly heartbreaking that even having made it
safely to Europe, they will continue to suffer the repercussions of the cruel
terrorist attacks carried out in Paris. </p>
<p>Borders are closing,
people's hearts are hardening to their plight, and these innocent families and
babies who wanted nothing mo<span>re than to run away from
it all and live safer and more dignified lives will be caught in the middle.</span></p>
<p>We can't let terrorists
win. There are bad people in this world, but they are outnumbered. We will win!</p>
<p>There are apps already on the market targetting help for refugees, but none of them is really complete in terms of functionality. We will build a full solution.<br/></p>

To give the refugees some help with our app is the best we can do right now and hopefully with more products that we will bring to market.
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448026962/jcm2ixghnuba33iffzry.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 618.218px; height: 347px;""/></p>
<br/><b>Into the future<br/><br/></b>
<p>It is obvious there
is much more that needs to be done. Refugees are nervous about their current
status and if they will be allowed to stay in the country they reside in.</p>
<p>The current process
around the asylum process are lengthy and by the huge demand the local
government offices are overwhelmed and people that arrive right now are likely
to wait till August 2016 to get a first meeting in the local office to get the
official stamp to stay in the country (like Germany for example).</p>
<p>We are talking here
right now about the 1,500,000 people that reside in Germany for example right
now. Hundreds of thousands will follow in 2016 and 2017. Estimations right now
are that at least 500,000 more will come each year from Syria alone. There are
no estimations about Afghanistan or other countries that are most likely be the
next waves of refugees.</p>
<p>Other European
countries have the same challenges, but not as big as Germany right now.</p>
<p>All those questions
around asylum and other things, if they are allowed to get a job for example
are also far, far away from being discussed.</p>
<p>If the app
development of approx. 5,000$ will be covered by the first wave of people that
help us, the next development will be an implemented social network, that
solves all those questions and in addition to that also covers a social
function, like finding family members that might reside in other countries and
got stuck there.</p>
<p>We have heard from a
lot of families that lost their family members while travelling from Syria to
Europe and got split up along the way. </p>
<p>This network would be
sharia conform and we could work together with refugees to define the needs for
such a network. This could satisfy a huge market demand for the 1.6 Billion
Muslims worldwide (29.2% of the world population), because Muslims are not
allowed to use the known networks like Facebook because of the Sharia.</p>

the cost for the development so far ourselves.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448029009/qz8vkcntwvemrp96pgxl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 232.207px; height: 163px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We need to cover the
cost for the development of the app (for IoS and Android) and a database with our Indiegogo
campaign which is 5,000$. As soon as we see that the costs will be covered, we
will start with the development. The first phase will be in English and German.
Arab will follow as soon as possible, if there is more money achieved than the 5,000$.
More languages will follow after that.</p>
<p>The first roll out
will be in Germany, as there is a ton of work to do for the 1,500,000 refugees
in 2015. </p>
<p>There needs to be a
lot of social media and PR work around that, to get the message out to the
media and get the information that there is an app for that, to the local camps
and humanitarian organizations. To get the word out will be the biggest part of
the work, after the development of the app. We might need local part time
helpers to do that.</p>
<p>We have experience in
rolling out a social network, as we have done that before and have a lot of
experience in social media.</p>
<p>The next phase will
be the roll out into other European countries. With a little luck this will
happen naturally, if the social media and PR campaigns gets international
attention.</p>
<p><b>What`s next?</b></p>
<p>We would kindly ask
you to help us to get this app developed. It would be highly appreciated if you
could spend an amount for our campaign to make this a huge success in terms of
rolling out the app and afterwards the social network.</p>
<p>If those two things
happen, the app will roll out to other places in Europe with their local
languages and all over the world. There are about 60 million refugees worldwide
and all of them have the same challenges and need help as fast as possible.</p>
<p>If this becomes a
worldwide success and millions of refugees and volunteers are using our
solution we will be in a situation to decide if this will be a project in the
social entrepreneur arena and spend more into the area of rolling out more
functions, that will help refugees around the world. But that’s not on our road
map right now, as it is way out in the dust.</p>
<p>You could be part of
the help for those people! Be part of it and click on the funding-button.</p>
<p>Everyone who will
help, will be part on the “Wall of social fame”, that will be part of the
webpage refugeehalpapp.com. Your name will be displayed there as one of the
people that helped to solve one of the biggest challenges the world has right
now.</p>
<p>We thank you from the
deepest of our heart and wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving and a peaceful Christmas
time.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Refugeehelpapp bittet um Ihre Mithilfe eine App und
Datenbank entwickeln zu können, die Flüchtlingen hilft sich in ihrem neuen Ort
schneller zurecht zu finden. Gleichzeitig hilft die App den Freiwilligen extrem
viel Zeit durch unnötige Fragen, die die App bearbeitet, einzusparen.</p>
<p>Die Refugeehelpapp wird all den Menschen helfen die alles
verloren haben. Wir werden den Flüchtlingen alle lokalen Informationen zur
Verfügung stellen, damit sie sich schneller vor Ort orientieren können.</p>
<p>Es benötigt nur eine Person um die Welt zu verändern. Seien Sie eine solche Person und bitte
helfen Sie uns!</p>
<p>Alle Beiträge werden direkt für die Entwicklung der App und
der Datenbank verwendet.</p>
<p>Wir sind eine Gruppe von Freiwilligen die sich
zusammengefunden haben und eine App und Datenbank entwickeln werden, die zunächst
den Flüchtlingen in Deutschland und im weiteren Ausbau weltweit helfen wird.</p>
<p>Wir sind immer noch auf der Suche nach Freiwilligen in
Deutschland, die uns helfen die lokalen Informationen in die Datenbank
einzupflegen. Je Flüchtlingscamp sind dies maximal 20 Minuten Arbeitsaufwand.
Hierdurch werden den lokalen Freiwilligen hunderte Stunden von Arbeit auf
längere Sicht erspart. Wenn Sie uns helfen wollen senden Sie uns bitte eine

<br/><b>Aktuelle Situation</b><br/><br/><p>Deutschland ist im Krisenmodus. Jeden Tag kommen neue Züge in
München, trotz verschärfter Grenzkontrollen an. Bis zum Jahresende werden
insgesamt 1,5 Millionen Flüchtlinge erwartet. Deutschland und die anderen,
nicht so willkommensfreudigen, europäischen Nachbarn definieren die aktuelle
Welle von Flüchtlingen als humanitäre Krise die gelöst werden muß.</p>
<p>Die größte Flüchtlingsgruppe die Europa erreicht, basierend auf
Angaben der Vereinten Nationen, kommend über die Türkei und Griechenland, via
Ungarn, Kroatien und Österreich sind Syrer, gefolgt von Irakern und Afghanen.
Hierbei handelt es sich um Kriegsflüchtlinge die auch weitestgehend als
Flüchtlinge betrachtet werden und nicht als Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge, die meist
aus den Balkanstaaten in Deutschland einreisen wollen.</p>
<p>Hunderttausende Menschen haben die Europäischen Küsten seit Januar
2015 erreicht, 3400 von ihnen sind bei dem Versuch gestorben und die Anzahl
wird bei sich jetzt verändernden Wetterverhältnissen drastisch steigen. Erst
letzte Woche wurden 13 Schiffswracks an der Küste Griechenlands entdeckt und
mindestens 150 Menschen starben oder werden vermisst, hiervor dutzende Kinder.</p>
<p>Allein letztes Jahr beantragten 23.000 unbegleitete Kinder Asyl in
einem der 28 Mitgliedsstaaten der Europäischen Union (aktuelle Zahlen der
Vereinten Nationen). Diese Zahl wird dieses Jahr drastisch höher sein, da die
Zahl der Flüchtlinge im Jahr 2015 um ein Vielfaches gestiegen ist. Aktuell
leben ca. 30.000 solcher Kinder allein in Deutschland. Die meisten dieser
Kinder haben ihre Eltern durch den Krieg oder durch Mord in ihrem Heimatland
verloren.</p>
<p>Um eine Asylgenehmigung zu erreichen muss der “wohlbegründete
Verdacht der Verfolgung” im Land der Flucht basierend auf Religion, Rasse, ethnische
Zugehörigkeit, politischer Überzeugung oder Mitglied einer sozialen
Gemeinschaft vorliegen. Wenn eine Person nachweislich aus einer Kriegszone wie
Syrien kommt ist es relativ einfach diesen Nachweis zu erbringen.</p>
<p>Die Situation in Europa ist nur ein kleiner Teil der Gesamtkrise
weltweit. Länder im Mittleren Osten die im Grenzbereich zu Syrien oder dem Irak
liegen, haben in den letzten Jahren selbst Millionen von Flüchtlingen
aufgenommen, wesentlich mehr als Europa. Asylsuchende in der Türkei, Libanon
und Jordanien werden auch in 2015 massiv ansteigen und auf ca. 4,5 Millionen
ansteigen.</p>
<p>Letztendlich ist das was gerade passiert weltweit nur die Spitze
des Eisbergs. Die vereinten Kräfte der UN, der Roten Kreuzes und anderer
humanitärer Vereinigungen reichen nicht mehr die weltweit aktuell 60 Millionen
Flüchtlinge die durch Krieg oder Verfolgung vorhanden sind zu betreuen, sagte
der Chef der UN-Flüchtlingshilfe am 3. November 2015. In den kommenden Jahren
werden neben die aktuellen Flüchtlinge auch immer mehr Klimaflüchtlinge vom
Süden in den Norden flüchten.</p>
<p>Alle die Herausforderungen werden nicht nur ein europäischen
Problem bleiben, sondern jedes Land in der nördlichen Hemisphäre in den
nächsten Jahren betreffen.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447941998/jakrmpt6alxpzo9hcv95.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Die Herausforderung</b></p>
<p>Im Dezember 2015 werden ca. 1,5 Millionen Flüchtlinge allein in
Deutschland sein. Grobe Schätzungen gehen davon aus das mehr wie 150.000 Helfer
(Hauptberufler und Ehrenämtler) in den Flüchtlingszentren helfen. Diese
arbeiten meist in 2 Schichten, was letztendlich heißt das auf jeden Helfer ca.
20 Flüchtlinge kommen.</p>
<p>Die lokalen Helfer sind aktuell schon sehr überfordert durch die
vielseitige Tätigkeit und vielen, vielen Fragen der Flüchtlinge wie z.B.</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Wo ist der
nächste Supermarkt wo ich Halal-Nahrung kaufen kann?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Wo gibt es
(kosten)freies Internet?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Wo finde ich
das Gemeindeamt?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Gibt es hier
einen Spielplatz für Kinder?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Wo kann ich
warme Kleidung für den Winter bekommen?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Wo finde ich
den nächsten Arzt?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Gibt es hier
ein lokales muslimisches Zentrum?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>Gibt es hier
in der Umgebung eine Moschee?</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>und viele,
viele andere Fragen…</p>
<p>Um sich der Brisanz dieser relativ einfachen Fragen einmal bewusst
zu werden und wieviel Zeit dies an nur einem Tag kostet, sollten wir uns einmal
folgende Zahlen ansehen.</p>
<p>Nehmen wir einfach an das 1 Flüchtling pro Tag nur eine Frage hat,
die 5 Minuten zur Beantwortung benötigt.</p>
<p>D.h. bei 1,5 Millionen Flüchtlingen x 5min dann 7.500.000 Minuten
am Tag (125.000 Stunden), nur um banale Fragen zu beantworten.</p>
<p>Wenn annehmen dass die Flüchtlinge ca. 16 Stunden am Tag wach
sind, dann heißt dies, dass 7.813 Helfer an einem Tag nichts Anderes machen als
nur banale Fragen zu beantworten.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From a pure cost perspective if the helpers would be paid by minimum wage (approx. 9.50$)</p>
<p>Betrachtung der Kostenseite unter der Annahme das die Helfer nur den Mindestlohn erhalten (was teilweise bei Hilfsorganisationen der Fall ist)<br/></p>
<p>7.813 Helfer, angenommener Mindestlohn 8,50€/hr x 16 Stunden/Tag = Ersparnis von 1.062.568€/Tag = 387.837.320 € 
.... nur durch diese App und Datenbank...</p>
<p>Diese Spendengelder können dann wieder sinnvoller investiert werden!<br/></p>
<p>Die meisten Helfer arbeiten schon 12-14 Stunden am Tag, viele von
ihnen unentgeltlich und eine Lösung für das hier angesprochene Problem würde
schon massiv Zeit sparen.</p>
<p>Es gibt aktuell eine riesige Anzahl an Hilfsaktionen in Deutschland (siehe Bild).</p>

<br/><p><b>Die Lösung</b></p>
<p>Es gibt am Markt schon verschiedene Apps für Flüchtlinge. Alle
diese Apps lösen das eine oder andere Problem, aber es gibt keine komplette
Lösung und die Flüchtlinge nutzen die Apps kaum oder gar nicht das diese nur
verwirrend sind.</p>
<p>Nachdem wir mit vielen Helfern gesprochen haben, haben wir
nachhaltig dein Eindruck bekommen, das die App die wir hier entwickeln den
Helfern sehr viel Arbeit abnehmen würde und den Flüchtlingen den Vorteil bietet
sich freier zu fühlen und nicht ständig für jede kleine Frage nachfragen zu
müssen.</p>
<p>Ergänzend zu der Funktionalität einen bestimmten, lokalen Ort zu
finden, werden wir die Funktion einbringen das Spender/Freiwillige zu jedem Zeitpunkt
wissen an welchem Standort aktuell welche Kleidungsspenden, Spielzeuge oder
andere Dinge benötigt werden.</p>
<p>Aktuell weiß niemand so genau in welchem Flüchtlingszentrum welche
Dinge benötigt werden. So gibt es Flüchtlingszentren die an Kleidungsspenden
überquellen und nicht wissen wohin mit den ganzen Dingen, während in anderen
Zentren Dinge sehr dringend benötigt werden. Unsere App wird dieses Problem
lösen.</p>
<p>Helfer vor Ort/Freiwillige werden in der Lage sein sich über ihr
Mobiltelefon oder den PC in das Dashboard der App einzuloggen und alle
notwendigen lokalen Daten (Fragen, Spenden etc.) dort einzugeben und in
Echtzeit dort abzulegen.</p>
<p>Die App wird all diese Informationen für Flüchtlinge, Helfer/Freiwillige
und Spendengeber zeitgenau dort abbilden. Das heißt letztendlich dass allen
Seiten hiermit gedient wird und gigantisch viel Zeit gespart wird.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Aktuelle Risiken<br/></b></p>

Die Geschehnisse in Paris durch die Anschläge der ISIS und die Absage des Fußballländerspiels Deutschland : Niederlande haben die Bevölkerung verunsichert. Inwieweit sich die Willkommensphilosophie für Flüchtlinge weiter aufrecht erhalten läßt wird abzuwarten sein. Letztendlich wäre es ein komplettes Disaster wenn sich die Meinung das ""alle Flüchtlinge Terroristen sind"" weiter verbreiten würde. Wir müssen mit allen Kräften dafür sorgen das dies nicht der Fall sein wird. <br/><p>Wir wollen und werden den Flüchtlingen und insbesondere auch den Freiwilligen mit unserer App helfen.</p>
<p>Es gibt schon diverse Apps für Flüchtlinge. Keine dieser Apps bietet jedoch eine so komplette Lösung wie wir sie hier vorantreiben werden.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448026962/jcm2ixghnuba33iffzry.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Zukunftsbetrachtung</b></p>
<p>Es ist klar ersichtlich dass noch viel, viel mehr getan werden
muss. Die Flüchtlinge sind extrem nervös über ihren aktuellen Status und ob sie
tatsächlich eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung/Asyl erhalten werden.</p>
<p>Der aktuelle Prozess rund um das Asylrecht ist extrem lange
bedingt durch den gigantischen Ansturm, der von den lokalen Behörden nicht
zügig abgewickelt werden kann. Flüchtlinge die aktuell in Deutschland ankommen
erhalten aktuell Termine für ein Erstgespräch für August 2016 um herauszufinden
ob das Asylrecht greift und die Flüchtlinge bleiben dürfen und ggfs. auch in
Deutschland arbeiten dürfen.</p>
<p>Bis zum Jahresende 2015 wird es in Deutschland 1.500.000 neue
Flüchtlinge geben. Hundertausende werden in 2016 und 2017 folgen. Vorsichtige
Prognosen gehen aktuell von mindestens 500.000 pro Jahr allein von Syrien aus.
Es gibt keine konkreten Zahlen für Afghanistan, Irak oder anderen Ländern, die
höchstwahrscheinlich die nächste Flüchtlingswelle auslösen werden.</p>
<p>Andere europäische Länder haben die gleichen Probleme, jedoch
nicht in der signifikanten Größenordnung wie Deutschland.</p>
<p>Alle Fragen rund um das Asylrecht und andere Fragen z.B. bezüglich
Arbeitsaufnahme in Deutschland sind weit davon entfernt mit den Neuankömmlingen
überhaupt besprochen werden zu können. Dinge rund um diese kritischen Fragen
könnten in einer weiteren Version der App auch eingebunden werden.</p>
<p>Wenn die ersten Entwicklungskosten für die App von rund 5000$
durch die Indiegogokampagne gedeckt werden, werden wir im zweiten Schritt ein
soziales Netzwerk implementieren das die über die rein örtlichen Fragen
hinausgehenden Fragen aufnehmen wird. Ergänzend hierzu sind z.B.
Funktionalitäten wie das Finden von Familienangehörigen hochkritisch, da viele
Flüchtlinge von ihren Familien auf dem Weg nach Europa von ihren Familien
getrennt werden.</p>
<p>Wir haben von vielen Fällen gehört wo Familienmitglieder in
anderen Ländern schlichtweg hängengeblieben sind und getrennt wurden.
Größtenteils wissen die Familienmitglieder nichts über den aktuellen Status und
hier könnte durch eine Mitgliedschaft in einem sozialen Netwerk die Suche
erleichtert werden. Dieses Netzwerk würde den Shariakonformen Bedingungen
entsprechen und wir würden hierfür Flüchtlinge mit entsprechendem Bildungsstand
einbinden. Dies könnte einen gigantischen Markt abdecken für ein
shariakonformes Netzwerk für die 1,6 Mrd Muslime weltweit (29.2% der
Weltbevölkerung) abdecken, da diese in der Regel die uns bekannten sozialen
Netzwerke wie Facebook nicht offiziell nutzen dürfen.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Was wir jetzt benötigen ist Hilfe bei der Entwicklung der App (für
Apple IoS und Android). Die Entwicklungskosten belaufen sich auf maximal 5000$.
Sobald abzusehen ist das diese Kosten durch die Indiegogo-Kampagne gedeckt
werden, werden wir mit der Entwicklung starten. Die erste Entwicklungsphase
wird in Englisch und Deutsch sein. Die arabische Sprache wird dann sofort
folgen. Weitere Sprachen werden folgen.</p>
<p>Der erste Rollout wird für Deutschland erfolgen, da hier aktuell
der Bedarf für die 1.500.000 Flüchtlinge in Europa am höchsten ist.</p>
<p>Es wird eine Menge an Social Media-Arbeit notwendig sein und die
Information dass es eine solche App geben wird, notwendig sein. Ziel dieser
Arbeit soll neben dem Investitionsaspekt auf Indiegogo auch die schnelle
Verbreitung der App via humanitärer Organisationen an die Flüchtlinge sein. In
Ergänzung zu unserer eigenen Arbeit werden hierfür sicherlich auch regionale
Helfer notwendig sein, die in den Flüchtlingszentren auf uns aufmerksam machen.
Sollten Sie hieran Interesse haben, freuen wir uns auf eine Mitteilung unter
social@refugeehelpapp.com.</p>
<p>In der Verbreitung eines sozialen Netzwerks haben wir eine sehr
große Erfahrung, da wir vor einiger Zeit an soziales Netzwerk auf den Markt
gebracht haben, welches zwischenzeitlich von einem Investor übernommen wurde. </p>
<p>Die nächste Phase, nach Deutschland, wird der Rollout in anderen
europäischen Ländern sein. Mit ein bischen Glück wird dies schon auf natürliche
Art und Weise passieren, wenn die Kampagne via Social Media, Presse und
Flüchtlingen eine internationale Aufmerksam bekommt.</p>
<p><b>Was passiert als nächstes? </b></p>
<p>Wir wären Ihnen sehr dankbar wenn Sie uns helfen würden die App zu
entwickeln und auf den Markt zu bringen. Es wäre sehr schön wenn Sie uns mit
einem Betrag fördern würden damit wir es schnellstmöglich schaffen die App und
womöglich auch das soziale Netzwerk auf den Markt zu bringen.</p>
<p>Wenn die Förderungssumme erreicht wird, werden wir die App
schnellstmöglich in Europa, mit den verschiedenen lokalen Landessprachen und
auch weltweit ausrollen. Es gibt weltweit 60 Millionen Flüchtlinge und alle
haben die gleichen Herausforderungen. Die Hilfe durch eine solche App und
womöglich eines solchen sozialen Netzwerks werden so schnell wie möglich
benötigt.</p>
<p>Wenn dieses Projekt ein weltweiter Erfolg wird und Millionen von
Flüchtlingen und Helfern diese App nutzen werden, dann werden wir entscheiden
ob aus dem gesamten Projekt ein soziales Unternehmen werden wird, welches dann
noch mehr notwendige Dinge auf den Markt bringen wird um den Flüchtlingen und
Helfern noch mehr zu helfen. Aber dies wird sich dann zeigen und das werden wir
dann entscheiden, wenn wir genau wissen ob diese Kampagne ihr Ziel erreicht
oder deutlich darüber hinaus finanziert wird.</p>
<p>Sie können Teil dieser gigantischen Initiative werden! Helfen Sie
uns bitte und drücken Sie den „Jetzt unterstützen“-Knopf!</p>

Refugeehelpapp urgently seeks your help in providing
refugees and the helping volunteers with an essential app and database that will help refugees
to feel home faster and saves a lot of time for all involved volunteers. You
can make a direct impact on a refugee life and on the volunteers by
contributing to our initiative.


Refugeehelpapp will help aid those who
have left everything behind. They arrive in refugee camps and it is our
intention to get them all local information they need with our app, so that
they can feel home faster and have a chance of fast integration into the
community.
All it takes is one person to start
changing the world, and it can start with you!
All donations will be used directly for
the development of an app and a database that contains all local
informations. 
We are a volunteer group who have united
together from across the globe with one common goal of aiding Syrian refugees
families in Europe in the beginning and to expand that worldwide if the
contributions are higher than the current need. 
Refugeehelpapp
is still seeking local volunteers, as a first step in Germany, who will help
locally with the input of data (doctors, supermarkets, mosques etc.). It’s a
mere 20min of work per refugee camp and will save you hours per day in the
future!!! If you would like to help us, please send an email to social@refugeehelpapp.com. Thank
you!

Current Situation
Germany is in crisis
mode. Every day trains packed with refugees arrive from the south, and despite
tightened border controls, as many as a 1.5 million are expected by the end of
the year. For all the warm and open talk coming from Chancellor Angela Merkel,
everyone knows that the financial and social costs of absorbing so many people
will be considerable.
Germany and its
less-welcoming European partners are treating the wave of refugees primarily as
a humanitarian crisis.
The largest group of
migrants entering Europe through Turkey and Greece and coming via Hungary,
Croatia and Austria to Germany are Syrians, followed by Iraqis and Afghans,
according to the United Nations refugee agency. Those who are fleeing war zones
have a strong claim to being refugees, rather than economic migrants.
Hundreds of thousands
of people have arrived on Europe's shores since January, more than 3,400 have
drowned and the death toll is rising quickly with the worsening weather. Just
last week, he said, there were 13 shipwrecks off the coast of Greece and over
150 people died or are missing, including dozens of children.
Last year, more than
23,000 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in the 28 member countries of
the European Union, according to the United Nations. That was before the number
of refugees surged this year. By now, 30,000 are estimated to live in Germany
alone. Most of them lost their parents to war or murder at home.
To receive asylum, a
migrant must show “a well-founded fear of persecution” in the country he or she
fled on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, political conviction or
membership in a social group. If that person is coming from a war zone like
Syria, it can be easier to make that case.
The situation in
Europe is only a smaller piece of the overall crisis. Countries in the Middle
East that border Syria or Iraq, where conflict has displaced millions over
several years, have accepted many more refugees than Europe. Asylum seekers in
Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan are expected to increase by almost a million in
2015, reaching 4.7 million by December.
But what is happening
right now is just the tip of the iceberg. The combined resources of U.N.
agencies, the Red Cross and humanitarian organizations are no longer enough to
protect the 60 million people displaced by war and persecution around the
world, the U.N. refugee chief said Nov 3rd, 2015. In the coming
years there will be more and more people coming from the southern hemisphere to
the north based upon climate change.
All of that is not a
European problem, this is a problem that will affect everyone else in the
northern hemisphere over the next few years.



The Challenge
There are 1.5 million refugees in Germany. Rough estimations are, that
approx. 150,000 people helping them in the refugee centers. By working in 2
shifts this means that per volunteer there are 20 refugees that need support.
The local volunteers in the refugee camps are overwhelmed by questions
like
- 
Where is the next supermarket where I can buy halal food?
- 
Where can I get Wi-Fi connection?
- 
Where is the local government office?
- 
Where is a playground for the kids?
- 
Where do I get warm clothes for the winter?
- 
Where do I find the next doctor?
- 
Where do I find a local Muslim center?
- 
Where do I find a mosque?
- 
and many, many more…
Now let assume that 1 refugee asks 1 question a day that takes 5 minutes
to solve.
1.5 million refugee questions a day mean 7,500,000 minutes (125,000
hours) a day, just answering questions.
Let assume that those
refugees are awake 16 hours a day. This would mean that round about 7,813
volunteers/helpers are doing nothing else than answering simple questions a day.
From a pure cost perspective if the helpers would be paid by minimum wage (approx. 9.50$)
7,813 helpers, lets assume a value of 9.50$/hr x 16 hours/day = savings of  1,187,576$ 
per day = 
    433,465,240$ 
per year.... with one app and database...
Means donations that the humanitarian organizations get, can be used for other things than answering simple questions!
There are approx.
150,000 volunteers/helpers from humanitarian organizations in the camps in
Germany alone. Most of them are simply overwhelmed by the work that needs to be
done other than answering questions. Lots of them are working 12-14 hours a
day, for free, just to help.
There are several
apps already on the market. All of them solve one or another issue, but there
is no complete solution for all major issues and the refugees are not picking
up on those apps, as it is too confusing.

We have a tremendous amount of local campaigns going on in Germany. Means, there is a lot of traction.



The Solution
By talking to a lot
of volunteers we got the impression that our app would help them dramatically
in saving a lot of time and would help the refugees a lot to feel free in
finding the right destinations.
In addition to that,
millions of people in Germany are giving away clothes, toys for kids, groceries
and so on, to help the refugees.
The challenge is,
that no one knows what is needed in which camp. Our app will also solve that.
Volunteers can put in the most needed items in their camp into the app, so that
people who would like to give, know exactly what is needed and where it is needed.
Volunteers will be
able to log in into a dashboard via mobile or PC and type in their local data
for their camp and put in all the information is needed, regarding questions or
things that are desperately needed.
The app will display
all information per camp for refugees, volunteers and people that will give
things for free. Means everyone will be happy and everyone saves a lot of time
to do more effective work other than just answering simple questions.

Risks and hurdles
Refugeehelpapp is deeply saddened by the recent
events in Paris. The refugees we are working so hard to help are the victims of
these same terrorists and it is truly heartbreaking that even having made it
safely to Europe, they will continue to suffer the repercussions of the cruel
terrorist attacks carried out in Paris. 
Borders are closing,
people's hearts are hardening to their plight, and these innocent families and
babies who wanted nothing more than to run away from
it all and live safer and more dignified lives will be caught in the middle.
We can't let terrorists
win. There are bad people in this world, but they are outnumbered. We will win!
There are apps already on the market targetting help for refugees, but none of them is really complete in terms of functionality. We will build a full solution.

To give the refugees some help with our app is the best we can do right now and hopefully with more products that we will bring to market.

Into the future
It is obvious there
is much more that needs to be done. Refugees are nervous about their current
status and if they will be allowed to stay in the country they reside in.
The current process
around the asylum process are lengthy and by the huge demand the local
government offices are overwhelmed and people that arrive right now are likely
to wait till August 2016 to get a first meeting in the local office to get the
official stamp to stay in the country (like Germany for example).
We are talking here
right now about the 1,500,000 people that reside in Germany for example right
now. Hundreds of thousands will follow in 2016 and 2017. Estimations right now
are that at least 500,000 more will come each year from Syria alone. There are
no estimations about Afghanistan or other countries that are most likely be the
next waves of refugees.
Other European
countries have the same challenges, but not as big as Germany right now.
All those questions
around asylum and other things, if they are allowed to get a job for example
are also far, far away from being discussed.
If the app
development of approx. 5,000$ will be covered by the first wave of people that
help us, the next development will be an implemented social network, that
solves all those questions and in addition to that also covers a social
function, like finding family members that might reside in other countries and
got stuck there.
We have heard from a
lot of families that lost their family members while travelling from Syria to
Europe and got split up along the way. 
This network would be
sharia conform and we could work together with refugees to define the needs for
such a network. This could satisfy a huge market demand for the 1.6 Billion
Muslims worldwide (29.2% of the world population), because Muslims are not
allowed to use the known networks like Facebook because of the Sharia.

The logo for the app is ready too and can be seen on the webpage. We have paid
the cost for the development so far ourselves.



We need to cover the
cost for the development of the app (for IoS and Android) and a database with our Indiegogo
campaign which is 5,000$. As soon as we see that the costs will be covered, we
will start with the development. The first phase will be in English and German.
Arab will follow as soon as possible, if there is more money achieved than the 5,000$.
More languages will follow after that.
The first roll out
will be in Germany, as there is a ton of work to do for the 1,500,000 refugees
in 2015. 
There needs to be a
lot of social media and PR work around that, to get the message out to the
media and get the information that there is an app for that, to the local camps
and humanitarian organizations. To get the word out will be the biggest part of
the work, after the development of the app. We might need local part time
helpers to do that.
We have experience in
rolling out a social network, as we have done that before and have a lot of
experience in social media.
The next phase will
be the roll out into other European countries. With a little luck this will
happen naturally, if the social media and PR campaigns gets international
attention.
What`s next?
We would kindly ask
you to help us to get this app developed. It would be highly appreciated if you
could spend an amount for our campaign to make this a huge success in terms of
rolling out the app and afterwards the social network.
If those two things
happen, the app will roll out to other places in Europe with their local
languages and all over the world. There are about 60 million refugees worldwide
and all of them have the same challenges and need help as fast as possible.
If this becomes a
worldwide success and millions of refugees and volunteers are using our
solution we will be in a situation to decide if this will be a project in the
social entrepreneur arena and spend more into the area of rolling out more
functions, that will help refugees around the world. But that’s not on our road
map right now, as it is way out in the dust.
You could be part of
the help for those people! Be part of it and click on the funding-button.
Everyone who will
help, will be part on the “Wall of social fame”, that will be part of the
webpage refugeehalpapp.com. Your name will be displayed there as one of the
people that helped to solve one of the biggest challenges the world has right
now.
We thank you from the
deepest of our heart and wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving and a peaceful Christmas
time.
Thank you!
God bless you all!

Refugeehelpapp bittet um Ihre Mithilfe eine App und
Datenbank entwickeln zu können, die Flüchtlingen hilft sich in ihrem neuen Ort
schneller zurecht zu finden. Gleichzeitig hilft die App den Freiwilligen extrem
viel Zeit durch unnötige Fragen, die die App bearbeitet, einzusparen.
Die Refugeehelpapp wird all den Menschen helfen die alles
verloren haben. Wir werden den Flüchtlingen alle lokalen Informationen zur
Verfügung stellen, damit sie sich schneller vor Ort orientieren können.
Es benötigt nur eine Person um die Welt zu verändern. Seien Sie eine solche Person und bitte
helfen Sie uns!
Alle Beiträge werden direkt für die Entwicklung der App und
der Datenbank verwendet.
Wir sind eine Gruppe von Freiwilligen die sich
zusammengefunden haben und eine App und Datenbank entwickeln werden, die zunächst
den Flüchtlingen in Deutschland und im weiteren Ausbau weltweit helfen wird.
Wir sind immer noch auf der Suche nach Freiwilligen in
Deutschland, die uns helfen die lokalen Informationen in die Datenbank
einzupflegen. Je Flüchtlingscamp sind dies maximal 20 Minuten Arbeitsaufwand.
Hierdurch werden den lokalen Freiwilligen hunderte Stunden von Arbeit auf
längere Sicht erspart. Wenn Sie uns helfen wollen senden Sie uns bitte eine
Email an: social@refugeehelpapp.com
. Danke für Ihre Mithilfe!
Aktuelle SituationDeutschland ist im Krisenmodus. Jeden Tag kommen neue Züge in
München, trotz verschärfter Grenzkontrollen an. Bis zum Jahresende werden
insgesamt 1,5 Millionen Flüchtlinge erwartet. Deutschland und die anderen,
nicht so willkommensfreudigen, europäischen Nachbarn definieren die aktuelle
Welle von Flüchtlingen als humanitäre Krise die gelöst werden muß.
Die größte Flüchtlingsgruppe die Europa erreicht, basierend auf
Angaben der Vereinten Nationen, kommend über die Türkei und Griechenland, via
Ungarn, Kroatien und Österreich sind Syrer, gefolgt von Irakern und Afghanen.
Hierbei handelt es sich um Kriegsflüchtlinge die auch weitestgehend als
Flüchtlinge betrachtet werden und nicht als Wirtschaftsflüchtlinge, die meist
aus den Balkanstaaten in Deutschland einreisen wollen.
Hunderttausende Menschen haben die Europäischen Küsten seit Januar
2015 erreicht, 3400 von ihnen sind bei dem Versuch gestorben und die Anzahl
wird bei sich jetzt verändernden Wetterverhältnissen drastisch steigen. Erst
letzte Woche wurden 13 Schiffswracks an der Küste Griechenlands entdeckt und
mindestens 150 Menschen starben oder werden vermisst, hiervor dutzende Kinder.
Allein letztes Jahr beantragten 23.000 unbegleitete Kinder Asyl in
einem der 28 Mitgliedsstaaten der Europäischen Union (aktuelle Zahlen der
Vereinten Nationen). Diese Zahl wird dieses Jahr drastisch höher sein, da die
Zahl der Flüchtlinge im Jahr 2015 um ein Vielfaches gestiegen ist. Aktuell
leben ca. 30.000 solcher Kinder allein in Deutschland. Die meisten dieser
Kinder haben ihre Eltern durch den Krieg oder durch Mord in ihrem Heimatland
verloren.
Um eine Asylgenehmigung zu erreichen muss der “wohlbegründete
Verdacht der Verfolgung” im Land der Flucht basierend auf Religion, Rasse, ethnische
Zugehörigkeit, politischer Überzeugung oder Mitglied einer sozialen
Gemeinschaft vorliegen. Wenn eine Person nachweislich aus einer Kriegszone wie
Syrien kommt ist es relativ einfach diesen Nachweis zu erbringen.
Die Situation in Europa ist nur ein kleiner Teil der Gesamtkrise
weltweit. Länder im Mittleren Osten die im Grenzbereich zu Syrien oder dem Irak
liegen, haben in den letzten Jahren selbst Millionen von Flüchtlingen
aufgenommen, wesentlich mehr als Europa. Asylsuchende in der Türkei, Libanon
und Jordanien werden auch in 2015 massiv ansteigen und auf ca. 4,5 Millionen
ansteigen.
Letztendlich ist das was gerade passiert weltweit nur die Spitze
des Eisbergs. Die vereinten Kräfte der UN, der Roten Kreuzes und anderer
humanitärer Vereinigungen reichen nicht mehr die weltweit aktuell 60 Millionen
Flüchtlinge die durch Krieg oder Verfolgung vorhanden sind zu betreuen, sagte
der Chef der UN-Flüchtlingshilfe am 3. November 2015. In den kommenden Jahren
werden neben die aktuellen Flüchtlinge auch immer mehr Klimaflüchtlinge vom
Süden in den Norden flüchten.
Alle die Herausforderungen werden nicht nur ein europäischen
Problem bleiben, sondern jedes Land in der nördlichen Hemisphäre in den
nächsten Jahren betreffen.



Die Herausforderung
Im Dezember 2015 werden ca. 1,5 Millionen Flüchtlinge allein in
Deutschland sein. Grobe Schätzungen gehen davon aus das mehr wie 150.000 Helfer
(Hauptberufler und Ehrenämtler) in den Flüchtlingszentren helfen. Diese
arbeiten meist in 2 Schichten, was letztendlich heißt das auf jeden Helfer ca.
20 Flüchtlinge kommen.
Die lokalen Helfer sind aktuell schon sehr überfordert durch die
vielseitige Tätigkeit und vielen, vielen Fragen der Flüchtlinge wie z.B.
- 
Wo ist der
nächste Supermarkt wo ich Halal-Nahrung kaufen kann?
- 
Wo gibt es
(kosten)freies Internet?
- 
Wo finde ich
das Gemeindeamt?
- 
Gibt es hier
einen Spielplatz für Kinder?
- 
Wo kann ich
warme Kleidung für den Winter bekommen?
- 
Wo finde ich
den nächsten Arzt?
- 
Gibt es hier
ein lokales muslimisches Zentrum?
- 
Gibt es hier
in der Umgebung eine Moschee?
- 
und viele,
viele andere Fragen…
Um sich der Brisanz dieser relativ einfachen Fragen einmal bewusst
zu werden und wieviel Zeit dies an nur einem Tag kostet, sollten wir uns einmal
folgende Zahlen ansehen.
Nehmen wir einfach an das 1 Flüchtling pro Tag nur eine Frage hat,
die 5 Minuten zur Beantwortung benötigt.
D.h. bei 1,5 Millionen Flüchtlingen x 5min dann 7.500.000 Minuten
am Tag (125.000 Stunden), nur um banale Fragen zu beantworten.
Wenn annehmen dass die Flüchtlinge ca. 16 Stunden am Tag wach
sind, dann heißt dies, dass 7.813 Helfer an einem Tag nichts Anderes machen als
nur banale Fragen zu beantworten.

From a pure cost perspective if the helpers would be paid by minimum wage (approx. 9.50$)
Betrachtung der Kostenseite unter der Annahme das die Helfer nur den Mindestlohn erhalten (was teilweise bei Hilfsorganisationen der Fall ist)
7.813 Helfer, angenommener Mindestlohn 8,50€/hr x 16 Stunden/Tag = Ersparnis von 1.062.568€/Tag = 387.837.320 € 
.... nur durch diese App und Datenbank...
Diese Spendengelder können dann wieder sinnvoller investiert werden!
Die meisten Helfer arbeiten schon 12-14 Stunden am Tag, viele von
ihnen unentgeltlich und eine Lösung für das hier angesprochene Problem würde
schon massiv Zeit sparen.
Es gibt aktuell eine riesige Anzahl an Hilfsaktionen in Deutschland (siehe Bild).


Die Lösung
Es gibt am Markt schon verschiedene Apps für Flüchtlinge. Alle
diese Apps lösen das eine oder andere Problem, aber es gibt keine komplette
Lösung und die Flüchtlinge nutzen die Apps kaum oder gar nicht das diese nur
verwirrend sind.
Nachdem wir mit vielen Helfern gesprochen haben, haben wir
nachhaltig dein Eindruck bekommen, das die App die wir hier entwickeln den
Helfern sehr viel Arbeit abnehmen würde und den Flüchtlingen den Vorteil bietet
sich freier zu fühlen und nicht ständig für jede kleine Frage nachfragen zu
müssen.
Ergänzend zu der Funktionalität einen bestimmten, lokalen Ort zu
finden, werden wir die Funktion einbringen das Spender/Freiwillige zu jedem Zeitpunkt
wissen an welchem Standort aktuell welche Kleidungsspenden, Spielzeuge oder
andere Dinge benötigt werden.
Aktuell weiß niemand so genau in welchem Flüchtlingszentrum welche
Dinge benötigt werden. So gibt es Flüchtlingszentren die an Kleidungsspenden
überquellen und nicht wissen wohin mit den ganzen Dingen, während in anderen
Zentren Dinge sehr dringend benötigt werden. Unsere App wird dieses Problem
lösen.
Helfer vor Ort/Freiwillige werden in der Lage sein sich über ihr
Mobiltelefon oder den PC in das Dashboard der App einzuloggen und alle
notwendigen lokalen Daten (Fragen, Spenden etc.) dort einzugeben und in
Echtzeit dort abzulegen.
Die App wird all diese Informationen für Flüchtlinge, Helfer/Freiwillige
und Spendengeber zeitgenau dort abbilden. Das heißt letztendlich dass allen
Seiten hiermit gedient wird und gigantisch viel Zeit gespart wird.

Aktuelle Risiken

Die Geschehnisse in Paris durch die Anschläge der ISIS und die Absage des Fußballländerspiels Deutschland : Niederlande haben die Bevölkerung verunsichert. Inwieweit sich die Willkommensphilosophie für Flüchtlinge weiter aufrecht erhalten läßt wird abzuwarten sein. Letztendlich wäre es ein komplettes Disaster wenn sich die Meinung das ""alle Flüchtlinge Terroristen sind"" weiter verbreiten würde. Wir müssen mit allen Kräften dafür sorgen das dies nicht der Fall sein wird. Wir wollen und werden den Flüchtlingen und insbesondere auch den Freiwilligen mit unserer App helfen.
Es gibt schon diverse Apps für Flüchtlinge. Keine dieser Apps bietet jedoch eine so komplette Lösung wie wir sie hier vorantreiben werden.



Zukunftsbetrachtung
Es ist klar ersichtlich dass noch viel, viel mehr getan werden
muss. Die Flüchtlinge sind extrem nervös über ihren aktuellen Status und ob sie
tatsächlich eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung/Asyl erhalten werden.
Der aktuelle Prozess rund um das Asylrecht ist extrem lange
bedingt durch den gigantischen Ansturm, der von den lokalen Behörden nicht
zügig abgewickelt werden kann. Flüchtlinge die aktuell in Deutschland ankommen
erhalten aktuell Termine für ein Erstgespräch für August 2016 um herauszufinden
ob das Asylrecht greift und die Flüchtlinge bleiben dürfen und ggfs. auch in
Deutschland arbeiten dürfen.
Bis zum Jahresende 2015 wird es in Deutschland 1.500.000 neue
Flüchtlinge geben. Hundertausende werden in 2016 und 2017 folgen. Vorsichtige
Prognosen gehen aktuell von mindestens 500.000 pro Jahr allein von Syrien aus.
Es gibt keine konkreten Zahlen für Afghanistan, Irak oder anderen Ländern, die
höchstwahrscheinlich die nächste Flüchtlingswelle auslösen werden.
Andere europäische Länder haben die gleichen Probleme, jedoch
nicht in der signifikanten Größenordnung wie Deutschland.
Alle Fragen rund um das Asylrecht und andere Fragen z.B. bezüglich
Arbeitsaufnahme in Deutschland sind weit davon entfernt mit den Neuankömmlingen
überhaupt besprochen werden zu können. Dinge rund um diese kritischen Fragen
könnten in einer weiteren Version der App auch eingebunden werden.
Wenn die ersten Entwicklungskosten für die App von rund 5000$
durch die Indiegogokampagne gedeckt werden, werden wir im zweiten Schritt ein
soziales Netzwerk implementieren das die über die rein örtlichen Fragen
hinausgehenden Fragen aufnehmen wird. Ergänzend hierzu sind z.B.
Funktionalitäten wie das Finden von Familienangehörigen hochkritisch, da viele
Flüchtlinge von ihren Familien auf dem Weg nach Europa von ihren Familien
getrennt werden.
Wir haben von vielen Fällen gehört wo Familienmitglieder in
anderen Ländern schlichtweg hängengeblieben sind und getrennt wurden.
Größtenteils wissen die Familienmitglieder nichts über den aktuellen Status und
hier könnte durch eine Mitgliedschaft in einem sozialen Netwerk die Suche
erleichtert werden. Dieses Netzwerk würde den Shariakonformen Bedingungen
entsprechen und wir würden hierfür Flüchtlinge mit entsprechendem Bildungsstand
einbinden. Dies könnte einen gigantischen Markt abdecken für ein
shariakonformes Netzwerk für die 1,6 Mrd Muslime weltweit (29.2% der
Weltbevölkerung) abdecken, da diese in der Regel die uns bekannten sozialen
Netzwerke wie Facebook nicht offiziell nutzen dürfen.


Weitere
Vorgehensweise
Die Webseite http://www.refugeehelpapp.com ist fertiggestellt. 



as Benutzerinterface der App ist ebenfalls fertig




Verbunden mit dieser
Seite sind 7 Konten bei den relevanten Sozial Media Plattformen und es wäre
großartig wenn Sie sich hier mit uns verbinden könnten um die jeweils aktuellen
News über unser Projekt zu erhalten.

Gleichzeitig wäre es eine große Hilfe wenn Sie unsere
Indiegogo-Kampagne mit Ihren Freunden auf Facebook, Twitter und anderen
sozialen Netzwerken teilen könnten, damit wir es schaffen die Kampagne weltweit
bekannter zu machen.

Das Logo für die App ist auch
bereits fertig und Sie können diese Dinge auch auf der Webseite sehen. Die
bisher entstandenen Kosten haben wir aus eigener Tasche bezahlt.



Was wir jetzt benötigen ist Hilfe bei der Entwicklung der App (für
Apple IoS und Android). Die Entwicklungskosten belaufen sich auf maximal 5000$.
Sobald abzusehen ist das diese Kosten durch die Indiegogo-Kampagne gedeckt
werden, werden wir mit der Entwicklung starten. Die erste Entwicklungsphase
wird in Englisch und Deutsch sein. Die arabische Sprache wird dann sofort
folgen. Weitere Sprachen werden folgen.
Der erste Rollout wird für Deutschland erfolgen, da hier aktuell
der Bedarf für die 1.500.000 Flüchtlinge in Europa am höchsten ist.
Es wird eine Menge an Social Media-Arbeit notwendig sein und die
Information dass es eine solche App geben wird, notwendig sein. Ziel dieser
Arbeit soll neben dem Investitionsaspekt auf Indiegogo auch die schnelle
Verbreitung der App via humanitärer Organisationen an die Flüchtlinge sein. In
Ergänzung zu unserer eigenen Arbeit werden hierfür sicherlich auch regionale
Helfer notwendig sein, die in den Flüchtlingszentren auf uns aufmerksam machen.
Sollten Sie hieran Interesse haben, freuen wir uns auf eine Mitteilung unter
social@refugeehelpapp.com.
In der Verbreitung eines sozialen Netzwerks haben wir eine sehr
große Erfahrung, da wir vor einiger Zeit an soziales Netzwerk auf den Markt
gebracht haben, welches zwischenzeitlich von einem Investor übernommen wurde. 
Die nächste Phase, nach Deutschland, wird der Rollout in anderen
europäischen Ländern sein. Mit ein bischen Glück wird dies schon auf natürliche
Art und Weise passieren, wenn die Kampagne via Social Media, Presse und
Flüchtlingen eine internationale Aufmerksam bekommt.
Was passiert als nächstes? 
Wir wären Ihnen sehr dankbar wenn Sie uns helfen würden die App zu
entwickeln und auf den Markt zu bringen. Es wäre sehr schön wenn Sie uns mit
einem Betrag fördern würden damit wir es schnellstmöglich schaffen die App und
womöglich auch das soziale Netzwerk auf den Markt zu bringen.
Wenn die Förderungssumme erreicht wird, werden wir die App
schnellstmöglich in Europa, mit den verschiedenen lokalen Landessprachen und
auch weltweit ausrollen. Es gibt weltweit 60 Millionen Flüchtlinge und alle
haben die gleichen Herausforderungen. Die Hilfe durch eine solche App und
womöglich eines solchen sozialen Netzwerks werden so schnell wie möglich
benötigt.
Wenn dieses Projekt ein weltweiter Erfolg wird und Millionen von
Flüchtlingen und Helfern diese App nutzen werden, dann werden wir entscheiden
ob aus dem gesamten Projekt ein soziales Unternehmen werden wird, welches dann
noch mehr notwendige Dinge auf den Markt bringen wird um den Flüchtlingen und
Helfern noch mehr zu helfen. Aber dies wird sich dann zeigen und das werden wir
dann entscheiden, wenn wir genau wissen ob diese Kampagne ihr Ziel erreicht
oder deutlich darüber hinaus finanziert wird.
Sie können Teil dieser gigantischen Initiative werden! Helfen Sie
uns bitte und drücken Sie den „Jetzt unterstützen“-Knopf!
Jeder der hilft wird namentlich auf der “Wall of Social Fame” auf
der Refugeehelpapp-Seite genannt werden. Ihr Name wird dort als einer genannt,
der eines der aktuell dringendsten, humanitären geholfen hat zu lösen.
Wir danken Ihnen schon jetzt aus ganzem Herzen und wünschen Ihnen
schon vorab eine wunderschöne Weihnachtszeit!
Lieben Dank für
Alles!",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>WSA's Solar Light &amp; Clean Water Initiative</h2>
<p>Imagine a world where darkness rules and light isn’t just the flip of a switch; a place where clean water isn’t the simple twist of a spigot; and for children, education and sports are more of a dream than a reality.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not an imaginary world; it’s just a plane ride away.</p>
<p>On the continent of Africa, More than 600 million people are without electricity, more than 500 Children Die each day due To Lack Of Clean Water and Sanitation, and 59 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 work instead of playing, attending school or participating in sports programs. That means that 1 in 5 children of these children is forced into child labor, robbing them of their childhood, every day!</p>
<p>Here at the WSA; we want to help.</p>
<p>World Sports Alliance (USA), and the World Sports Alliance IGO, together work as nongovernmental and inter-governmental organizations created as the result of a global public and private initiative in partnership with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, whose global mission is to promote sports as a means of diplomacy, socio-economic mobility, human development, education and training for the 530 Million people that make up the citizens of its 33 member states. </p>
<p>With a team of Ph.D.'s, MBA's, Financial Experts, Marketers and even Aerospace Engineers, the WSAUSA  continues to execute its global mission in the furtherance and full support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through the development of initiatives and programs;  such as GCI, the Global Coaching Initiative. and the groundbreaking WSA TV and WSA TV On Demand; using sports as the gateway to bringing light, clean water, and human development to countries, villages and their people around the world. </p>
<p>We need your help to press the play button and make these programs possible.</p>
<p>Support our campaign today to help bring these programs to people who so desperately need them.  </p>
<p>Allow them to experience the world you live in; a world that they, can only imagine.</p>
<h2>Our Goal &amp; Mission</h2>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to bring solar light and clean water beginning with 15 villages in Africa.</p>
<p>Sponsoring this our mission will allow us here to bring a solar light and water filtration equipment to each person in these villages.  Just the fact of bringing light and clean water to these villages will not only reduce the number of bacteria-related deaths due to contaminated water supplies but also increase the opportunity of families and their children to study and live their lives several hours more each day beyond sunset, something we take for granted.</p>
<p>Through our 33 member states, representing over 500 million people, our first initiative will be to partner with 15 different villages throughout Africa to bring them portable personal solar lights that they charge during the day and use at night as well as with provide them with personal water filtration equipment that will allow their families access to clean drinking water for more than a year.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>We that live in the United States and other 1st world countries around the world take for granted the ability to just turn on a light with the flip of the switch or go to the sink or refrigerator for fresh, clean, filtered water that is free of dangerous bacteria and is safe to drink.  Those in many villages across Africa, this is not the case on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Imagine that your days end every day when the sun goes down.  What do you currently accomplish every day at night?  If it is even just relaxing, spending time with the family or catching up on the news or current events.  It is all achievable because of the benefit of light and electricity that you have.  We want to provide this benefit to all of the people in 15 villages in Africa.  Also, think about the millions of people in Africa that get sick and even die each year due to water born bacteria.</p>
<p>We are looking to bring proven water filtration equipment to these villages to help them eliminate these concerns, creating a more prosperous and successful life for these communities, villages, and people.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>As with anything, there are risks and challenges, but with our experienced NGO team, we believe with the utmost confidence that we have identified our risks and are mitigating them before they become a reality.  For over a decade, WSA's staff has been working through our network with multiple organizations, companies and the governments of Africa within our 33 member states.  These relationships have allowed us to solidify our distribution process so that we can execute this operation with minimal delays or concerns.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you are not able to donate, please <strong>SHARE, SHARE and keep on SHARING </strong>our mission.  Please share this campaign on social media and tell your friends.  We are trying to make a difference and we would love your help to spread the message as far and wide as possible!</p>

The fallacy of homelessness is that for those who live it, there is or was a choice. The perception is often that homelessness exist as a differentiator of “lazy” people from hard workers.
 If the economic collapse of 2008 did anything positive, it proved once and for all that absolutely any human being is susceptible to the perils of homelessness.
 Homelessness does not discriminate.
 In the changing landscape of technology, manufacturing, ecologically motivated industrial reform, jobs are lost.
As the population never stops growing while politics change what kind of healthcare or housing or work we have available to us, there will always be people left out, people unprepared for the change that comes to them
While homelessness is a sad fact of human civilization today and may always be, we can never turn a blind eye to the people who fall victim to it.
    Hosting at least 10% of our current Baltimore City homeless population becomes a win/win for the guest as well as the OOH team, community.260 people from Baltimore City will inspire others and create per outing the ripples that will touch the hearts of many. Providing showers, toilets and laundry services in a mobile environment not only delivers hygiene but it rekindles dignity and hope for hundreds per site event. With 9,500 showers expected to be delivered every year, the projection would be to increase our availability, increase the number of showers, and support services.    This mission is much more than providing hygiene; it’s about eliminating barriers to opportunity and reconnecting people with their dignity. OOH hopes to shatter the illusion of ‘otherness’ that dehumanizes the homeless. We aim to seed hope and rebuild humanity with safe, private showers. This is OOH’s charge.Of the thousands of showers expected to be delivered,  we anticipate that many are actively working to change their circumstances - seeking employment and housing, pursuing higher education, and working to overcome health-related and substance, alcohol, and mental health issues.  This pilot program’s best practices will serve as an important road map to other areas, including Washington, DC. Every night, there are 3,500 homeless men, women and children in Baltimore City and 11,623 homeless people within the greater Washington DC region. Due to the lack of access to existing shelters.The Organization of Hope will provide Mobile Hygiene services to the homeless to increase their access.There are only 13 emergency shelters in Baltimore City and only 7 places in the Washington DC area.Both venues face this challenged daily, with the number of people to be served and limited capacities to accommodate them The Organization of Hope team will be coming out to deliver the hygiene service.For the homeless community to shower outside of a shelter. Living and maintaining hygiene, laundry, and sanitation needs due to a lack of access, presents a severe challenge, and reduces the opportunity to embrace an excellent quality of life.     The Organization of Hope, in collaboration with Baltimore City organizations and government agencies, is committed, along with our Community; Brick, and Mortar, In/Kind partners have directly targeted and will engage the Baltimore homeless community beginning February 1, 2018. With the first Baltimore City Mobile Hygiene unit. The unit will be dispatched to a designated site location and will consist of four safe and private stalls and one ADA safe and private stall for toilet and shower utilization for approximately 50-60 guests a day, with one hour allocated to each guest. In addition,  the unit will provide a sink, 2 washers, 2 dryers, and appropriate disposal receptacles.Our Mobile Hygiene team will effectively embrace Radical Hospitality by providing an experience for our guests that revitalizes and re-humanizes. •  Launch the first Baltimore City Mobile Hygiene unit and complete approximately 50-60 showers a day,  9,500 yearly•  Collaborate with existing Baltimore City organizations and government agencies to deliver our services where they are needed most•  Effectively embracing radical hospitality by providing an experience to our guests that revitalizes and re-humanizes.To provide showers, toilets, and laundry services in a mobile environment to deliver hygiene and rekindle dignity for our homeless citizens.•  Opportunity unfolds when people are treated with dignity; in turn boosts resilience, which is critical to overcoming adversity.
When it comes to dignity, society has different standards for those with resources vs. those who lack them.
Delivering an unexpected level of care, to people moving through homelessness restores dignity, rekindles optimism, and fuels a sense of opportunity.
    We anticipate that many of our homeless population are actively working to change their circumstances by seeking employment and housing, pursuing higher education. Working to overcome health-related, substance abuse, and mental health issues, all these are difficult when the basic hygiene needs are not available.  The Organization of hope will provide those basic hygiene needs.     Our goal is to create a self-perpetuating model that will drive the OOH project well into the future. Scalability is critical to ensuring the longevity of the program. Year one start-up and operational costs suggest an initial investment of approximately $400,000, with roughly 10% coming from non-government donations. Year 1 expense breakdown: 
Start-up, truck, and trailer ($144, 000; 34%),
Salaries ($203,000; 39%),
and operational expenses ($105,000; 27%).
We expect dramatic growth in years two and three as we expand to new locations. Inorganic growth will be driven by grassroots social campaigns. Additional revenue will be generated through mobile advertising, public and corporate donations, and the '$ per shower per day' campaign.We believe that start-up funding plus reoccurring donation funding will enable the OOH mobile hygiene to run for at least five years and well beyond.    OOH/Bridging Hope which is a 501(c)(3) was founded in 2009to enrich lives and improving communities.     Our strategy is practical as well as dynamic.

In the past two years the execution toll has been on a rise, with nearly 2000 executions since Rouhani took office. 
We decided to put together this book to echo the voice of the voiceless, to actually be that 'someone' 'somewhere' who actually takes a stand and does something to prevent future ""what if""s.
After hundreds of hours of work, the book has come together, but now we need help to print it!
our goal is to be able to raise the funds and have the book published by international day against executions, October 10th and to send this book to the office of human rights organizations, UN missions, the media and make it available to all those who care about human lives. 
Because we hope one day, cranes will be used for construction in our homeland instead of being used for destruction of lives.

   
We need help to raise money for the following,- Layout, cover design- Editing & proofing- Printing


We've all pitched in ourselves but this is what is remaining from the total costs. Our request is for you to help us as much as you can, because every help makes a difference!As my mother would always say “drop by drop we can make an ocean”.

<h2> </h2>
<p>Sex trafficking is a global crisis, existing not only in foreign countries but right here at home in the United States. Men, women, and children of all ages have been victims forced into doing paid sex acts by pimps and traffickers all across the country in both large cities and small rural towns. But what does it all have to do with Foster Care?</p>
<p>A vast number of foster care children in the U.S. enter the so-called “foster care to prostitution pipeline"" every year. According to The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 60% of young people in the business of sex trafficking and prostitution were once in Foster Care. Or in other words, <b>1 out of 2</b> sex trafficking &amp; prostitution victims were in Foster Care at some point in their life.</p>
<p>Additionally, 48% of homeless youth between ages 18-23 performed paid sex acts simply because they lacked a safe place to stay according to Covenant House in NYC. Sadly, many of these victims are young girls who were coerced to engage in paid sex acts while still minors within the system, creating prime candidates for pimps and traffickers to lure into the prostitution industry once they aged-out.</p>
<p>When the Department of Children and Families Secretary David Wilkins was asked what the traffickers offer these young women and girls, Wilkins replied “love.” “These guys basically say, ‘I’m here for you. I’m going to be your protector, I’m going to be your support function.’ And sure, they shower ’em with gifts and drugs and parties and limousines…and then the next thing you know, they ask ’em to take the next step, and then they’re caught.”</p>
<h3>What is our plan?</h3>Within a single home, we can house 2-5 young women, giving them the opportunity to attend a local college and become self-sufficient; virtually eliminating their risk of being forced into local prostitution.<br/><br/>We will beat the traffickers at their own game and prevent the coercion of these girls by providing them with a loving community and safe housing as well as utilities, groceries, and the various other material needs of young women who have aged-out of foster care. We will be their shield and defender so that they can continue their education, utilize their federal college scholarships, and work towards a productive &amp; rewarding career.<br/> <h3>What kind of impact will providing housing have on their lives?</h3>A HUGE ONE. According to the Children’s Home Society of Florida, by providing housing to youth aging out of foster care, they are more likely to attend college, graduate or earn a GED, as well as find employment, have fewer mental health challenges, and are less likely to be arrested. Furthermore, those who are given a safe housing arrangement are also less likely to abuse substances, less likely to engage in violent or destructive behaviors, less likely to become parents before they’re ready, are more likely to be financially stable, and are far more likely to become self-sufficient, independent adults.<br/><br/>Most importantly, they will not end up homeless and eventually coerced into prostitution! You will not only be dramatically altering the lives of these young women, but also their children for generations to come!<br/> <h3>Where will the first home be located?</h3>We will establish the first home in my beautiful hometown of Ormond Beach Florida where the girls will be able to thrive and continue their education in safety. We have selected the city of Ormond Beach for the first home as it will be logistically expedient to be near the girls and secondly we have selected Ormond in order to combat the increased sex trafficking activity in the greater Daytona Beach area. As we grow and exceed our funding goals, we will branch out and establish additional homes in others cities both in Florida and across the United States.<br/> <h3>Why Florida?</h3>Being a huge tourist state, traffickers provide the supply for the increasing demands of predators on vacation. For example, during the March 2015 Daytona Beach bike week, 43 were arrested in a child sex and prostitution sting named ""Operation Predatour"".<br/><br/>Additionally, an average of 1,290 children age out of foster care in Florida each year according to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. Upon the foster child’s 18<sup>th</sup> birthday the children are given a small amount of money and sent out into society with no housing or employment. As a result, youth between the ages of 18-23 are the fastest growing homeless population in Florida according to the Treasure Coast Homeless Services Council.<br/> <h4>Overall, homelessness leads to prostitution, drug use, arrests and other life destroying events. Preventing orphan homelessness directly correlates to preventing sex trafficking and will positively change the lives of these young women forever!</h4>

According to The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, 60% of young people in the business of sex trafficking and prostitution were once in Foster Care. Or in other words, 1 out of 2 sex trafficking & prostitution victims were in Foster Care at some point in their life.
Additionally, 48% of homeless youth between ages 18-23 performed paid sex acts simply because they lacked a safe place to stay according to Covenant House in NYC. Sadly, many of these victims are young girls who were coerced to engage in paid sex acts while still minors within the system, creating prime candidates for pimps and traffickers to lure into the prostitution industry once they aged-out.
When the Department of Children and Families Secretary David Wilkins was asked what the traffickers offer these young women and girls, Wilkins replied “love.” “These guys basically say, ‘I’m here for you. I’m going to be your protector, I’m going to be your support function.’ And sure, they shower ’em with gifts and drugs and parties and limousines…and then the next thing you know, they ask ’em to take the next step, and then they’re caught.”
What is our plan?Within a single home, we can house 2-5 young women, giving them the opportunity to attend a local college and become self-sufficient; virtually eliminating their risk of being forced into local prostitution.We will beat the traffickers at their own game and prevent the coercion of these girls by providing them with a loving community and safe housing as well as utilities, groceries, and the various other material needs of young women who have aged-out of foster care. We will be their shield and defender so that they can continue their education, utilize their federal college scholarships, and work towards a productive & rewarding career. What kind of impact will providing housing have on their lives?A HUGE ONE. According to the Children’s Home Society of Florida, by providing housing to youth aging out of foster care, they are more likely to attend college, graduate or earn a GED, as well as find employment, have fewer mental health challenges, and are less likely to be arrested. Furthermore, those who are given a safe housing arrangement are also less likely to abuse substances, less likely to engage in violent or destructive behaviors, less likely to become parents before they’re ready, are more likely to be financially stable, and are far more likely to become self-sufficient, independent adults.Most importantly, they will not end up homeless and eventually coerced into prostitution! You will not only be dramatically altering the lives of these young women, but also their children for generations to come! Where will the first home be located?We will establish the first home in my beautiful hometown of Ormond Beach Florida where the girls will be able to thrive and continue their education in safety. We have selected the city of Ormond Beach for the first home as it will be logistically expedient to be near the girls and secondly we have selected Ormond in order to combat the increased sex trafficking activity in the greater Daytona Beach area. As we grow and exceed our funding goals, we will branch out and establish additional homes in others cities both in Florida and across the United States. Why Florida?Being a huge tourist state, traffickers provide the supply for the increasing demands of predators on vacation. For example, during the March 2015 Daytona Beach bike week, 43 were arrested in a child sex and prostitution sting named ""Operation Predatour"".Additionally, an average of 1,290 children age out of foster care in Florida each year according to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. Upon the foster child’s 18th birthday the children are given a small amount of money and sent out into society with no housing or employment. As a result, youth between the ages of 18-23 are the fastest growing homeless population in Florida according to the Treasure Coast Homeless Services Council. Overall, homelessness leads to prostitution, drug use, arrests and other life destroying events. Preventing orphan homelessness directly correlates to preventing sex trafficking and will positively change the lives of these young women forever!

Zoë Bands are uni-sex bracelets made from the life vests refugees wear on their harrowing journey across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Lesvos, Greece. 
This venture was created so people could provide refugees with aid while simultaneously spreading compassion in their communities by wearing an intimate piece of the refugee journey.
All profit we generate (each bands costs us about $5 to make) goes directly towards purchasing the food, clothing and medical supplies the refugees so desperately need. 



Our Story

However, our trip quickly changed as we continued to learn more and more about the refugee crisis. We eventually decided to fly into Lesvos and volunteer.

The Largest Humanitarian Crisis of Our Time

The fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and, most notably, Syria has created the largest refugee crisis since World War 2. Among just Syrians, over 4 million have been forced to flee their country in hopes of sparing their lives.

Over a million war victims have decided to make the trek to Europe, with Greek island of Lesvos serving as the primary entry point. In the absence of aid and asylum from the global powers, money-hungry criminal organizations have begun operating dangerous smuggling routes that risk refugee lives while robbing them of their remaining life savings.
These people understand the dangers of this journey and are aware of the uphill battle that awaits them in Europe, and they still come. This lets you know how bad it must be for them back home and how much they need our support. 
We included a short video below of what remains of once-bustling Homs, Syria for a glimpse into the reality they faced before fleeing.

We Employ Locals - Zoë bands provide much need jobs by being manufactured in Lesvos by locals. Employees are given full time work and paid fair living wages.



We Buy Local - All clothing, food and medical supplies is purchased from local shops and restaurants. We purchase products from many different locations in order to keep many local businesses afloat. By purchasing locally, we are also able to stretch each dollar further by avoiding shipping costs.

We're Restoring the Island's Beauty - For every refugee that arrives, a life vest is left on the shores of Lesvos. By up-cycling the life vests into Zoë Bands, we are helping restore the beaches to their previous beauty.


 
   You Serve the Most Important Role: Spreading Empathy At the end of the day, this project is about spreading empathy and compassion. We can't do that without you. 
Zoë Bands stand out due to their unique material and bright color. People will ask you about yours. Every time you explain the history behind the band, you will be doing a service to those affected by this crisis. 
You will be an agent of compassion across borders, religions, races and so much more. You will compel people to reflect on one of the earliest lessons we all learn: do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Perhaps you will even compel them to support those in need.


Risks and Challenges
By employing local seamstresses to do our manufacturing, we are able to create beautifully handcrafted products. However, it does not help us scale quickly, so there might be some delay in fulfilling orders if our project is a great success.Our access to life vests is also not something we have full control over. Right now there is no shortage of vests, but future regulations or government action may dictate our ability to fulfill all orders with bands made from life vests. If we do run into this issue, we will do our best to create and provide you with an alternative band to honor your order.

The Bands

Our flagship orange Zoë Band sells for $20

Our red Zoë Band costs $100. It is only available during this Indiegogo campaign.

The $250 blue Zoë Band
By purchasing a black Zoë Band, you will also be buying a once in a lifetime trip for two to Lesvos. Black bands sell for $10,000 and are exclusive to this Indiegogo campaign.Spread the Word!This project, up until now, has been fully funded by Zoë and I. We have no big budget for marketing, so WE ARE RELYING ON YOU TO MAKE THIS A VIRAL SUCCESS.Please share this project!Thank you so much for your consideration and support.",16.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Why Am I So Passionate About This project?</p>
<p>In Uganda you can literally be killed because of who you love. Homosexuality is still criminalised, female genital mutilation still tolerated and freedom of speech is severely restricted. People who fall outside of the countries cultural belief structure face life threatening brutality, life imprisonment or death.</p>
<p>As a woman alive at this time in history, I know I can no longer deny the extreme brutality that many of my sisters still live with.</p>
<p>Rising with our Ugandan sisters is a call for all of us to put ourselves in the shoes of these women and to ask ourselves honestly what it truly means be part of this global human family?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who am I?</p>
<p>My name is Jenny Smith and I am a woman living in West Wales working for a Global women’s organisation. Through my work I have come to know and care for a beautiful, extraordinary Ugandan woman called Phionah who has given her life to working tirelessly for human rights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Phionah's story</p>
<p>Two weeks ago Phionah was dismissed from her job because her employer found out that she was supporting a house of seven lesbian women by committing 40% of her wages to ensure their survival. <br/><br/>One of the seven women who had previously been disowned by her family and her school took her own life that evening and had to be buried in a public cemetery as her family refused her place in the ancestral plot because of their views about her sexuality.<br/><br/>Another of the women was visited by her father who brutally attacked her leaving her hospitalised with severe injuries. Phionah was later prosecuted and imprisoned for supporting lesbian women.</p>
<p>The reason I have offered to raise funds for Phionah and the six remaining women that she supports is purely and simply that it is needed. They have access to no state support in Uganda and in order to protect their lives they need to stay under the radar of the state.<br/><br/>The money from this crowd-funder will create a financial buffer covering rent; food; heating and basic essentials for the next six months creating a window of time during which Phionah and her work can be linked into wider sources of on-going support. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We Are A Global Human Family</p>
<p>Please, lets no longer sit and feel powerless to do anything about the injustices in the world, neither longer look away or towards 'those in power' to do the right thing. Rising in response with our love and offering the resources that we have is what we are able to do. Will you stand with us?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We are inviting contributions to raise a lump sum of £2500 to cover the living costs of Phionah's women for the next six months.</p>
<p> £10 pays for fuel for a weeks cooking                                                                                                            £25 will buy a decent dress, new shoes and food for a fortnight                                                                 £50 will provide sanitary towels for all six women for six months                                                                 £100 pays for rent, food and heating for a month                                                                                    £500 pays for food, rent fuel and college tuition for three months</p>
<p>Every dollar we raise will go directly to Phionah via the organisation Equality Heals Africa, and every dollar will make a huge difference. Any dollar over our target amount will go towards longer term care of our sisters. Phionah has a dream of supporting them to create business opportunities such as hairdressing or beautician so that they can be self supporting in the future.</p>
<p>We are offering each one of you who contributes to Rising With Our Ugandan Sisters a place in our online Global Meditation Circle of Love Ceremony. This live event will be hosted by Jenny Smith and Sophie Mortimer of TreeSisters and will be a beautiful guided meditative journey energetically weaving our hearts and minds together, collectively raising our consciousness to co-create the beautiful heart-centric world that we all long for and that our survival depends on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>We want to offer security and stability to an extremely vulnerable group of women in our global family. We also long to create a circle of love around them which energetically supports and protects them from the daily threats of their immediate world.<br/><br/>We want to offer people a chance to make a difference in a very simple way and in a very profound way.<br/><br/>By stepping into this circle you are saying yes to the shift in consciousness that our world is calling out for; you are opening your heart to suffering that may be miles away but that is still on all of our watch; and you are powerfully refusing to collude in hate, in homophobic hatred. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Stepping forward in life always calls for 'vulner-bravery'. It is both an exposing and a courageous act. My deepest wish for this campaign is that is soars far and wide and that we raise way over our target and I know that for that to happen I need many supporters and allies along the way. With my hand on my heart I ask sincerely for all the help that is available to us, both visible and invisible to support the joyful and easeful success of Rising with our Ugandan Sisters</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The world needs a lot of love and work right now. Everywhere we turn (or everywhere we look online), there's another crisis: climate change, institutional racism and homophobia, suicide rates and mental health stigma, and the stripping of reproductive rights from women and other uterus owners, to name a few.​</p>
<p>The bright side is that a lot of people care about these crises and want to assist in stomping them out. The problem is that few of us know how to help, aside from talking about it on social media—which is an important part of the process, but also the easiest thing to do and only the beginning. ​</p>
<p>Packtivism was born after founder Adrianna Nine (that's me!) connected these dots and thought of a way to help people along their activist journeys: starter packs that included vital information, materials to write to one's elected officials, and fun yet useful tools to help raise awareness and make a difference in the real world. These packs, assembled to suit individual timely issues, would be affordable and easy to use. ​</p>
<p>The Rainbow Pack, Save the Planet Pack, Mental Health Pack, and Reproductive Rights Pack are the first activist starter packs to join Packtivism's online storefront. As we grow, we'll add more starter packs and exciting add-ons to the shop. </p>

<h3>Our Motivation</h3>
<p>There is currently no means to ensure the safety of an officer and a motorist during a traffic stop. This is a problem that was made painfully clear through the shootings of Philando Castile and Michael Flamion this past summer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these shootings are only the tip of an iceberg. During 2015 alone, over 100 individuals were fatally shot during traffic stops. According to the FBI, between 2000 and 2012, 127 police officers have been killed and 72,413 have been assaulted during traffic stops. Statistics like these help reinforce exactly why routine traffic stops are stressful and sometimes deadly situations for motorists and law enforcement officers alike.</p>
<p>We don’t believe that this status quo is acceptable. That’s what motivated us to develop and build the Sentinel Robotic System.</p>
<h3>Sentinel Robotic System </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486434625/po2twegwgkx03x4jmitv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>- 170° HD Camera for 2-way video communication and  incident recording</p>
<p>- Driver's license scanner and digital ticketing capabilities</p>
<p>- Software to automatically populate driver's license information into incident reporting form</p>
<p>- Seven-foot lift can reach some of the highest windows on the road</p>
<p>- High-visibility police lighting</p>
<p>- Semi-autonomous all wheel drive allows easy operation in any weather </p>
<p>- Sensor array capable of detecting alcohol and THC at the same sensitivity as a police officer - no more, no less</p>
<p>The exoskeleton of this robot was designed using 3D modeling and printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM) - in other words - 3D printing. We also designed this robot to be modular, so that it could be easily modified to meet the needs of each law enforcement agency. This also makes repair turnarounds much faster.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486258737/erqghc0jnwvujfp6jihe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Our Motivation
There is currently no means to ensure the safety of an officer and a motorist during a traffic stop. This is a problem that was made painfully clear through the shootings of Philando Castile and Michael Flamion this past summer.
Unfortunately, these shootings are only the tip of an iceberg. During 2015 alone, over 100 individuals were fatally shot during traffic stops. According to the FBI, between 2000 and 2012, 127 police officers have been killed and 72,413 have been assaulted during traffic stops. Statistics like these help reinforce exactly why routine traffic stops are stressful and sometimes deadly situations for motorists and law enforcement officers alike.
We don’t believe that this status quo is acceptable. That’s what motivated us to develop and build the Sentinel Robotic System.
Sentinel Robotic System 

Features
- 170° HD Camera for 2-way video communication and  incident recording
- Driver's license scanner and digital ticketing capabilities
- Software to automatically populate driver's license information into incident reporting form
- Seven-foot lift can reach some of the highest windows on the road
- High-visibility police lighting
- Semi-autonomous all wheel drive allows easy operation in any weather 
- Sensor array capable of detecting alcohol and THC at the same sensitivity as a police officer - no more, no less
The exoskeleton of this robot was designed using 3D modeling and printed using fused deposition modeling (FDM) - in other words - 3D printing. We also designed this robot to be modular, so that it could be easily modified to meet the needs of each law enforcement agency. This also makes repair turnarounds much faster.


The result is a robotic system that is robust and adaptable and can be produced at a much lower cost compared to conventional fabrication techniques. Below are images of the 3D printers used to create this exoskeleton as well as images of the individual pieces during fabrication.


The robot assembly was completed with simplicity in mind. Most military and law enforcement robotics are complex machines that require expert robotics and mechanics knowledge. We wanted our system to easily maintained in the event of a failure in the field.

<p>Dear Friend(s) of Veterans,</p>
<p>My name is <b>Linda Holt</b>.   I am a below-knee amputee and an Army Veteran.<b>  </b>I receive my medical care at

I have been accepted to compete in several wheelchair sporting events as a goal
in my continued rehabilitation and in my efforts to regain confidence,
motivation and both physical and emotional independence.  This will be my
first time participating in this awesome event.</p>
<p>I am seeking to raise funds needed
for sending myself and other Disabled Veterans, who also receive care at the
Salisbury, NC VAMC, to the <b><a href=""http://wheelchairgames.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">35th Annual National Veterans Wheelchair Games</a> </b>where we will be competing in

<p><b>National Rehabilitation Special Events </b>are physical activities, friendly competition, and recreation

and a well-earned sense of accomplishment. </p>
<p>I have
always been very sports-minded and physically active.  Since my amputation in 2002, it has been very difficult for me to participate in sports
or be as active as I had once been.  This has affected my self-esteem and
led to my becoming very isolated.  This is often the case with veterans
who have undergone physical trauma. The V.A. has been a true lifesaver for
me and many of my fellow veterans.  Their programs for physical and
emotional rehabilitation are helping me to return to the sports and physical
activities that I have missed so much.  The opportunity to attend the <b><a href=""http://wheelchairgames.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Veterans Wheelchair Games</a> </b>will allow me to participate with other veterans in friendly competition and the training I've been receiving at the V.A. is
helping to rebuild my self-confidence and self-image and, I believe, will help
me to overcome my self-isolation.</p>
<p>It's a long way from my home in North
Carolina to the <b>Wheelchair Games </b>in Dallas, Texas and the expenses for
travel and lodging are higher than my small disability pension will allow.
 The V.A. is providing me with the specialized sports wheelchair needed to
participate in these sports and are paying for half of my hotel room.  I
am asking for donations to help with the cost of travel to and from the <b>Wheelchair

Homeless Helping Homeless’s houseless operated facility has carried on its work
of welcoming folks regardless of ability to offer a dime, for a number of years
with the full knowledge of the city and Tampa police department. That is, until
they won a <a href=""http://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/homeless-charity-sues-tampa-contends-panhandling-laws-are-unconstitutional/2230621"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lawsuit</a> challenging the city’s anti-panhandling laws – and with
another suit pending, the city followed up by sending 16 police cars to the Homeless
Helping Homeless Floribraska facility in the morning hours of September 3<sup>rd</sup>
to raid, seize passwords, search the grounds and give folks 4 days to vacate
the premises. We as a community have challenged outdoor food-sharing bans,
panhandling laws, police brutality, and a host of other ordinances that have
(and were meant to) do nothing more than make houseless persons’ activities of
daily living impossible – even criminal, all to cater to folks more fortunate.</p>
<p>Homeless Helping Homeless is in immediate need of funds to house those
evicted and to obtain another facility that can withstand local government
attacks and code violations. Homeless Helping Homeless is the only emergency
shelter in Hillsborough County that allows homeless men and women, who have no
money, job or government vouchers to stay longer than five days in a
facility. They provide, lockers, showers, beds, help with i.d.’s and birth
certificates, hygiene kits, meals, free laundry, numerous other services and show that the houseless community is
not looking for a hand-out, they are extending their own hands out to help lift up
others. Homeless Helping Homeless does incredible work for our community. It’s
time for us to return the favor. Please consider donating generously to support
these efforts by and for homeless individuals to empower and help themselves in the face of governmental repression.</p>

<h3>About Sanctuary Homes Crowdfunding Campaign</h3>
<p>Hate groups and people who threaten or harm others are growing. These groups and people are located around the world and continue to recruit and grow in number. Today, hate groups in the USA are the highest in 20 years. Unfortunately, there are very few technical innovations to help victims protect themselves against these acts of hate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Radius helps those being threatened or who live in fear of these acts by providing them a mobile app that can quickly locate sanctuary locations near them. By simply clicking a button, users can locate any sanctuary home or sanctuary business near them. All sanctuary locations have been vetted by the local community they live in. Radius does not monitor or collect any data with its sanctuary services and our servers will be located in countries that protect the rights of our members. Surrounding privacy and security, our members' personal information is treated with the highest priority.</p>

<p>- Provides all members a team creation tool for team projects and a jobs directory where individual and team work projects will be posted</p>

It took us over 2 years to build phase 1 because we basically had zero funds, forcing us to work at a very slow pace.

We were NOT created FOR these women but BY these amazing resilient women. From the very beginning, Remedy Georgia has been a co-creation solution, providing local fresh food and assistance with rebuilding lives.</h2>
<p>There are many expenses involved in such an endeavor, so these #StandFor1100 funds are much needed to expand our work. We are in the process of preparing for our next program starting in March, which includes new kitchen facilities to manage hands-on training and scaling box lunch catering.</p>
<p>We stand with these girls &amp; women as they transform there lives, will you join us and support our campaign?</p>

Remedy aims to fill this reintegration gap. In addition, we’re created to prevent girls from being exploited in the first place. In the face of this landscape, we launched Remedy in April 2013 to provide much needed prevention &amp; reintegration support.</p><p>What can 100 people do to assist Remedy Georgia?</p><p>100 people donating $10 will support one woman that has chosen to participate in our holistic job training program. Remedy Georgia focuses on exploitation prevention by providing a summer program for underserved girls and programs throughout the year for the women that these girls grow into that are now choosing to proudly step out of this life. It costs a little over $1000 to put a participant through the 8 week Training Program. In 8 sessions, participants are trained to put the outcome of their future in their own hands. Each woman receives the tools to build their leadership, career and a business, plus the opportunity to help run Remedy Georgia, a farm-to-table catering company.</p><p>Now imagine $10 doubled, tripled, even multiplied by 10.

</div></div>","Welcome to Remedy Georgia. We are a farm-to-table catering company built on the foundation of a job training program for under-served women and survivors of trafficking. We were NOT created FOR these women but BY these amazing resilient women. From the very beginning, Remedy Georgia has been a co-creation solution, providing local fresh food and assistance with rebuilding lives.
There are many expenses involved in such an endeavor, so these #StandFor1100 funds are much needed to expand our work. We are in the process of preparing for our next program starting in March, which includes new kitchen facilities to manage hands-on training and scaling box lunch catering.
We stand with these girls & women as they transform there lives, will you join us and support our campaign?
Join Us To Be The Remedy!
- Trina, Jinean and ENTIRE Remedy Georgia crew!

Jinean Robinson + Trina Braxton  Remedy Georgia FEATURED @ Plywood Conference (Community Leaders L to R, Aneesah Allen, Jinean Robinson, Founder, Charlotte Robinson, Dr. Kemberly Edwards, Executive Director)_________________________The ProblemGeorgia fluctuates between the #1 and #3 state for the exploitation of girls under the age of 18.This equates to 100 girls sold for sex every night in the state capital, Atlanta, alone.Girls and women who have made the tough decision to escape this life are overwhelmingly unable to secure gainful employment. Remedy aims to fill this reintegration gap. In addition, we’re created to prevent girls from being exploited in the first place. In the face of this landscape, we launched Remedy in April 2013 to provide much needed prevention & reintegration support.What can 100 people do to assist Remedy Georgia?100 people donating $10 will support one woman that has chosen to participate in our holistic job training program. Remedy Georgia focuses on exploitation prevention by providing a summer program for underserved girls and programs throughout the year for the women that these girls grow into that are now choosing to proudly step out of this life. It costs a little over $1000 to put a participant through the 8 week Training Program. In 8 sessions, participants are trained to put the outcome of their future in their own hands. Each woman receives the tools to build their leadership, career and a business, plus the opportunity to help run Remedy Georgia, a farm-to-table catering company.Now imagine $10 doubled, tripled, even multiplied by 10. When you choose to partner with a contribution of $10 or more, you choose to put more women through the training program.Whatever you decide to give, even $10 goes to supporting the goal.Will you #StandWith100 by backing us today?  _________________________How Remedy StartedIn 2010, our founder, Jinean Robinson spoke to a group of young sex trafficking survivors that left her with a lasting impression.

There were kids roaming around in tattered and unkempt clothes, labourers exhausted after a hard day of work and women who had toiled all day long at both in and out of the household and each one of them had one thing in common: their desire for a satisfying meal.

<p>At first I began sending fruits to the nearby school for the underprivileged everyday. However, the knowledge that I was still not doing enough would gnaw at me.

<p>The idea is to provide the people with four chapatis everyday along with pickles. We aim to feed 60,000 people in the first year with your contributions. The reason we have specifically chosen chapatis is because it is high on vitamins and minerals; it is good for digestion and due to its high carbohydrate level, it increases the energy levels of the consumer. Therefore, chapattis can be handed out, easily as well as be a meal on its own.  Further, in return for the meals we will ask the beneficiaries to do one good deed per day for the betterment of the community. This can involve anything from helping someone cross the road to offering a hug to someone who is going through a tough situation.

<div>The road to achieving our goals will not be smooth, but we are determined to overcome the obstacles for the people who are in dire need of food and proper meals throughout the day.</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Funds - One of the main hurdles will be of collecting the required funds to not only kickstart this campaign but also sustain it. The basic requirements of the campaign, such as the chapati making machine, kneader, flour, transportation costs and so on can only be overcome when we have sufficient funds. Our way of overcoming this hurdle is by starting this online campaign on Indiegogo and placing our trust in the online community to provide a suitable conclusion to this good cause. Further we will also be participating in door to door campaigning, wherein we will encourage other residents of Gurgaon; our family, friends and relatives to contribute towards this cause. </li>
<li>Distribution - Once the campaign has started, the process of distributing the chapatis and pickles will prove to be tricky. This is because we need to identify the precise time at which we can feed the most people in the vicinity. A way to overcome this is through thorough study, which is already underway during which we are speaking to the labourers, children and families in the slum areas to identify when and at which places we can serve the most people. </li>
<li>Infrastructure - Gurgaon is infamous for its power cuts. However, with a chapati making machine and a tight meal distribution schedule we can't afford to be delayed by electricity lapses. Therefore, we intend to have a power back up system that can solve this problem. In the future, in order to make this project as environment friendly as possible, we are looking to install solar panels to power the chapati machine. </li>
<li>Logistics - To make a chapati and deliver it into the hands of those who need it most, a chapati making machine and flour are not the only requirements. Things such as storage spaces, suitable packaging for chapatis and transportation costs also need to be kept in mind. We plan to overcome this by using a room in our own apartment as a storage space. As the volumes of chapatis increase, we will obviously need to shift to a larger space which will require funds. For the transportation, in the beginning we plan to deliver them via rickshaws. Using rickshaws, will also ensure that we will be employing the labourers (example: rickshaw drivers) in the delivery process so that they can deliver food to other hungry people like them in the area. Therefore, we will not only help with their meals but also their income. </li>

<p>Sometimes, it takes an outsider to state the obvious.  This project is about a book &amp; a movement.  The book is nearly finished except for a data-intensive synthesis that will illustrate the social history of the United States in beautiful visualizations that allow readers to learn and understand intuitively without important meanings being lost, buried deep in hundreds of pages of endless prose.  The movement, like the book, is nearly complete as well, except it is currently in a state of deep hibernation.  This is not my project; the project belongs to Americans, past, present and future.<br/>I cordially invite you as a teammate in this endeavor if you can make one or more of the following statements:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>I love my country, but I don’t necessarily agree with everything that my country has done or is now doing;</span></li>
<li>Voicing my views, based upon well-informed perspectives rather than on unfounded opinion or baseless ideas is one of the highest expressions of patriotism;</li>
<li>I possess the intellectual curiosity to pursue the truth, the courage and maturity to confront it and all that its implications entail, and the intrepid and unwavering conviction to follow it;</li>
<li>Negativity thwarts progress, scapegoating deflects accountability, interpersonal disagreement does not necessitate interpersonal incivility or hostility;</li>
<li>Talking alone has never changed the world so either be about it, or kindly shut your mouth! </li>

<h1>Mission</h1>
<p></p>
<p>After history had been made in the election of the country’s first Black president, the New York Times reported “<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/us/politics/05elect.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Racial barrier falls in decisive victory</i></a>,” but is that statement really true?  Did a barrier come down, or are we looking at an anomaly?  Here we are in the year 2015, exactly 150 years after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified by the necessary three-fourths of states. The Amendment was intended to “<i>obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the slave system</i>” which provides the phrase I currently favor as the title of the book.  On March 28, 1864, Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts delivered a long oration in the 1st session of the 38<span>th Congress:</span></p>
<p>""Sir, slavery in America, though upheld by interests, customs, and usages, trenched about by inhuman statutes, and hedged around by passionate, vehement, and unreasoning prejudices, is fast crumbling into atoms beneath the blows rained upon it by a liberty-loving and patriotic people.  But let anti-slavery men listen to no truce, to no cry for mercy.  Let them now be as inflexible as justice, as inexorable as destiny…</p>
<p>If <b><i>this amendment </i></b>shall be incorporated by the will of the nation into the Constitution of the United States, it will <b><i>obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the slave system</i></b>; its chattelizing, degrading, and bloody codes; its dark, malignant, barbarizing spirit; all it was and is, everything connected with it or pertaining to it, from the face of the nation it has scarred with moral desolation, from the bosom of the country it has reddened with the blood and strewn with the graves of patriotism.""</p>
<p>Interpreted in the most literal manner, the powers given by the Declaration of Independence and fully embodied in Constitution of the United States, there would be no need for appending articles to assign privileges that were previously deemed as “unalienable rights.” Since chattel slavery was a pre-existing condition at the time of drafting the Declaration of Independence, however, the very presence of slavery as an instrument of the national economy and badge of American culture made it necessary for either an act of Congress or executive order of the President to remove it.  Both occurred, however laws are not sufficient to change culture as they cannot regulate what persists in the hearts and minds of human beings. </p>
<p>In 1968, after having been ruled in favor of an oppressive defendant seeking to deny an interracial couple the right to purchase a home in a new subdevelopment, upheld by the appellate, in a case finally reached the US Supreme Court.  In the ruling which was reversed in favor of the Black plaintiff, Justice Potter Stewart mentioned the following in his <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/392/409"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">landmark opinion</a>:</p>
<p><i>""Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery. Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom -- freedom to ""<b>go and come at pleasure</b>"" and to ""<b>buy and sell when they please</b>"" -- would be left with ""a <b>mere paper guarantee</b>"" if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the <b>Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep</b>. ""</i></p>

<br/><h1>Why This? Why Now?</h1>
<p>Information that is not used to produce benefit is nothing more than data.  When we apply that information in intelligent and useful manners, then we transform data into <b><i>knowledge</i></b>. One core theme for this project is that our society has plenty of informational resources available, yet tragically, our knowledge is inadequately low.  We complain incessantly via social and traditional media, yet rather than taking proactive steps to change or improve the world we live in, we tend to passively listen, view, or otherwise consume incomplete and often erroneous data, sometimes in as small a dose as 140 characters at a time.  Has anything truly monumental ever been accomplished with such superficial techniques?  I am an advocate for technology and as an operations consultant, I have achieved proficiency in more applications than most people will ever use in their entire lifetimes, but none of the technology-enabled activities we have at our disposal today will make a positive impact on our world if we do not first open our minds and our hearts in order to enlighten ourselves as we transform and transcend all that ails us at present.</p>
<p>The information we just mentioned comes from many sources.  There have been thousands of new doctorate degrees awarded since the 1960s in fields such as economics, sociology, history, education, and so many more, but what has the net social impact been? There are nearly one million non-profit organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service under sub-chapter 501(c)(3), all claiming to have an altruistic mission.  Philanthropists give, foundations spend, corporations donate, and a massive effort from seemingly credible institutions spends hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing and advertising each year to make you and I feel good about ourselves and our financial contributions to “worthwhile” causes. </p>
<p>Beyond the “feel good” photo opportunities of celebrities and athletes posing with inner city children, despite the apparent “success” of the giving campaigns in your workplace, diseases continue to be manufactured at a higher rate than the drugs themselves (quite convenient for pharmaceutical companies, I know), cancers of every strain continue to adapt, millions of defenseless children are living in unhygienic environments or altogether homeless, and the sad indicators could fill more pages than anybody would have time to read.  And, if you happen to be Black, by nearly every meaningful metric imaginable, the living circumstances of the average African-American—especially younger males—has deteriorated to an alarming extent. </p>
<p>Lectures at colleges and universities, blogging, etc has failed to move the collective needle of the Black male’s socio-economic status. I am not blaming others for what they have not yet accomplished; rather, I am commending them by leading this initiative to leverage their contributions, synthesize their research, and stand on their shoulders to flip on the switch that has been dark since our nation began.  I have always been amused by historians who refer to the “good old days” nostalgically.  If, like me, you are the descendant of an African slave in America, please remind me when those days occurred, because I cannot seem to remember.  Was it the day when we walked off the plantation, fearing for our lives, pockets and stomachs empty, feet bare, bones and muscles aching, probably incapable of reading a sign on the road and without any practical experience to assist us in navigating our journey to this allegedly wonderful place known as freedom?  Was it when you saw your relative or friend dragged off by a screaming mob to be brutally tarred and feathered or even lynched in a tree—two barbaric acts that even the cruelest humans alive would not likely inflict upon the lowest beast God ever created? </p>
<p>Was it the day when your relatives or ancestors were sent off to war and deployed in the riskiest tours to be killed at twice the rate of others?  Was it when it seemed like every time you turned your head, another young Black leader was being gunned down in front of his family or friends?  These are questions which we need to stop asking, because in order to heal the wounds—and the wounds are as deep as they are—we need to have the resolve to revise our entire approach to the world as we know it.  We need to shed old paradigms and recognize once and for all that what our predecessors attempted was limited to their generation and their resource constraints, and now we live in a time period where we have the tremendous advantage of hindsight, yet we lack understanding and knowledge. </p>
<p>At the outset, it is worth clarifying that most people misuse the word ‘equality’ as it refers to race relations.  What the Declaration of Independence and Constitution discuss is equality of opportunity, not equality in all regards.  As a simple illustration, imagine a bag containing marbles of assorted colors. Despite its color, each marble is composed of the same material, has identical weight and is the exact same as all other marbles with regard to other observable physical properties. We learned basic probability in middle school mathematics such that if there are 50 red marbles in the bag and also 50 blue, then we would be surprised to find that after one thousand random trial observations (with replacement), we pulled 750 blue marbles and only 250 red. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242450/files/20150223091036-Marbles.jpg?1424711436"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Why does this outcome shock us?  Because we are smart enough to realize that with the same constituent contents, the probability of drawing a red marble is identical to that of drawing a blue marble, exactly 50%.  Anytime we find a pattern of observations that deviates from the expected value, we must conclude that there is something else causing the discrepancy. </p>
<p><b>How does our remedial math lesson relate to the Thirteenth Amendment, over which President Abraham Lincoln would lose his life?</b></p>
<p>Dean of the School of Law at University of Pittsburgh, Michael Carter, Jr offers us a glimpse of the inherent complexity of Article XIII itself based on the cultural environment in which it was hatched.</p>
<p>Carter states “<i>On the whole, however, the Amendment remains under-enforced in comparison to the broad scope the contemplated in its legislative history, the ideology of its drafters, and the historical circumstances in which it was adopted</i>.”</p>
<p>This book uses research contributions from historians, sociologists, economists, legal theorists, psychologists and other notable thinkers, integrates their contributions and in so doing, answers the questions about what went wrong with regard to incomplete implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment.  Most importantly, it paints a picture of what needs to occur, and unlike other books or approaches, places emphasis on the necessary cultural shift that can only be achieved through Americans—representing the diversity and <i>patriotic pluralism</i>that makes our nation great—increasing their awareness and sensitivity to subtle, often unnoticed or even unconscious factors that while unseen strongly influence the way our society functions.</p>
<h2>Ingroups and Outgroups</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We have a tendency to only pay attention to things that we believe will benefit us personally.  Although that statement does not appear to be overly controversial, it becomes a challenge for us as a society of overly-individualistic humans who refuse to come to agreement on what resources and means need to be shared—and to what extent—in order for us to sustainably co-exist within a complex network of organic communities, polities, and geographies.  We vary with regard to language, tradition, culture, political orientation, and even in superficial terms of physical attributes like skin color. When we deal with others as we would like to be dealt with, those variations could be a source for greater human understanding as the Quran describes:</p>
<p>""<i>O mankind! We have created you from a single male and a female, and made you into various nations and tribes <b>that you may become better acquainted with one another</b>. Verily, the most honorable of you in the sight of Almighty God are those who have the most piety. Verily, Almighty God is All-Knowing, All-Aware. </i>[Chapter 49, Verse 13]""</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we emphasize the dissimilarity of others, it can easily develop into dangerous interpersonal antagonism, which leads to <i>ingroup bias</i>.  Alfred Adler, one of the most under-appreciated thinkers, physicians, psychologists of the prior century, eloquently articulated the antecedents of <i>ingroup bias</i>.  The more familiar manifestation of ‘ingroup’ in vernacular can be spotted in our usage of the plural pronouns ‘we’ or ‘us.’ </p>
<p>Adler tells us how the ‘<i>us</i>’ typically develops:</p>
<p>""<i>In our present-day culture, people are still easily misled to isolate themselves, and to separate themselves into nations, creeds, and classes.  In all manners of isolation the familiar traits of ambition and vanity take the particular form of contrasting oneself with the others and of proving, by withdrawing from them, that one is different...<span>Those who have traveled have found people everywhere are approximately the same in that they are always inclined to find something by which to <b>degrade others</b>. Everyone seeks a means which permits him to <b>elevate himself</b>at little cost.""</span></i> ~ (Adler, 1927)</p>
<p>Just as one cannot truly know ease without having known hardship, we cannot understand <i>ingroups</i> without also seeking to understand <i>outgroups</i> as well. In order to have an ‘<i>us</i>’ there must exist a target reference group that we refer to as ‘<i>them</i>.’</p>
<p>Below, Adler explains how the ‘<i>them</i>’ can come about:</p>
<p><i>""Difficulties in earning a livelihood, bad working conditions, inadequate educational and cultural facilities, a joyless existence, and continuous irritation, all these factors increase the feeling of inferiority, produce oversensitivity, and drive the individual to seek ""solutions."" To an individual in this state of mind, any <b>outside interference appears as a threat</b> to his security and rouses him to active or passive self-defense. Motives of hatred appear most clearly in economic disturbances of our time. . . . Destruction means to the masses a release from situations felt intolerable and thus appears to them as a preliminary condition of improvement. ""</i> ~ (Adler, 1925)</p>
<p>Now that we understand these basic concepts, I want to direct our attention to their significance within this book and the broader project’s context.  For Blacks to be discriminated against, there must be a relatively more powerful <i>ingroup</i> who targets Blacks as the <i>outgroup</i>.  Until now, most of the “resistance” to such discrimination, at least as articulated by those who have been anointed as Black leaders in the past, has focused on the <i>blackness</i> of ‘us’ versus the oppressive<i>whiteness</i> of ‘them.’ This dichotomy of thought—indeed of the more general worldview—plays an instrumental part towards explaining why racial disparity was created and why it has persisted. </p>
<p><b><i>Last Lingering Vestiges: For those skeptics who say that the Civil Rights legislation “leveled the playing field,” we ask you to open your eyes and reconsider. #vestiges2015</i></b></p>
<p>In the US context, Adler was not the only pioneer of psychology and sociology to address racial tension and disparity.  Kurt Lewin and Gordon Allport, who we’ll mention more later also made deeply insightful observations, which unfortunately have not been leveraged to the benefit of American society as of yet. This book seeks to change that.  In the height of what we now look back on as the Civil Rights Era in the United States, a massive undertaking to investigate the roots of race tension was launched by executive order of President Lyndon B. Johnson. </p>
<p>While it is not possible to discuss the results from the Kerner Commission Report in detail, but a soon-to-be written update will provide highlights.  I mention the Kerner Report here, to illustrate how regrettable it was to have conducted a study of that magnitude and significance without having utilized the powerful minds of Adler, Lewin or Allport, none of whom are mentioned within nearly 600 pages of detailed findings, summary and appendixes.  Adler and Lewin had long since passed, and Allport died in 1967, the same year the report was issued, but their writings were obviously available.  If society doesn’t benefit from those whom possess the most knowledge about specific issues of great relevance to the society itself, then it is no wonder we find ourselves moving backwards towards darkness rather than advancing toward the light.  Not even Abraham Maslow, whose insights were sought by Civil Rights’ activists repeatedly in order to help understand the social impact of discrimination, was listed among the hundreds of special advisor or consultants to the Kerner Commission.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1256508/files/20150228121809-Kerner_cover.jpg?1425154689"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Two of the more compelling statements from the Kerner Report’s executive summary published in 1967 should sober our minds enough to understand the relevance to this project and to our nation’s history:</p>
<p><i>""Our nation is moving toward <b>two societies</b>, <b>one black, one white</b>-- separate and<b>unequal</b>. Reaction to last summer's disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division...Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life; they now threaten the future of every American. This deepening racial division is not inevitable. The movement apart <b>can</b> be reversed. ""</i></p>
<p>A third and final statement for this discussion highlights how the fact that the Kerner panel of experts—comprised of major city police chiefs, sociologists, legal theorists, retired judges, political activists, industry executives and economists, among others, happened to omit the human dimension that only an understanding of the mind (i.e. psychology)—is nothing less than a travesty:</p>
<p><i>""This alternative will require a commitment to national action  --compassionate, massive and sustained, backed by the resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on this earth. From <b>every American</b> it will require new <b>attitudes</b>, new <b>understanding</b>, and, above all, new <b>will</b>.""</i></p>
<p>If it is not obvious already, the only way the three concluding elements—attitudes, understanding, and will—can be changed is through acquiring a better and more functional understanding of psychology.  Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, fulfilling the promise of the Thirteenth Amendment by obliterating the last lingering vestiges is not a concern of just African-Americans, it is the <b><i>moral obligation of all Americans!</i></b></p>

<h1>Not Ancient History</h1>
<p>If you ask any serious scholar of American history who they consider the most influential, perhaps even most important historical figure to the founding ideology of the United States, and you might hear different responses, but without any doubt, a near majority will likely mention Thomas Jefferson, and even those who do not mention his name first will almost certainly mention him among the top three most influential Americans of his day, perhaps of all-time.</p>
<p>As a history major and even as a young fan of history, I do not recall ever studying the more controversial statements Jefferson made which helped to define the nature of race relations in this country from its earliest origins, and continue to shape our attitudes today.  Not only did Jefferson elaborate on the social pressures exacerbated by tensions between Whites and Blacks, but he also exposed the hypocrisy buried deep within the very foundation of this nation.  While some historians have attacked Jefferson on account of his slave ownership, insulting remarks alleging biological and genetic inferiority of Blacks, I use Jefferson in this book for a much more instrumental purpose.  Because Jefferson is of central importance to this nation’s philosophical and ideological orientation, more than George Washington as hero, or as Alexander Hamilton as a defender of the republic, Jefferson symbolizes the quintessential point of departure for what has occurred in our society since its political birth in 1776.  Africans were known to have set foot in what is now the Mid-Atlantic region in the 16th century, and African slaves are known to have been forcibly trafficked into colonial Virginia in 1619.  Yet more than these earlier historical milestones Jefferson’s life, from 1743 to 1826 is a symbol.  His writings, more than his actions, established the longstanding patronizing attitudes that Blacks could only survive under the White man’s care and supervision.  Jefferson’s writings also foretold of the explosive conditions that would emerge in the aftermath of the slave system..  In an 1820 letter written to John Holmesone of the chief architects of the Missouri Compromise which admitted Maine to the union as a free state while accepting Missouri’s union entry as a slave state, Jefferson wrote:</p>
<p><i>""I can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach, in any practicable way. The cession of that kind of property, for so it is misnamed, is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought, if, in that way, a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected; and gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it might be. But as it is, we have <b>the wolf by the ear</b>, and <b>we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go</b>. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.""</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242480/files/20150223092451-Thomas_Jefferson_letter_to_John_Holmes__U.S._politician__April_22_1820.jpg?1424712291"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Interestingly enough, while some historians point to this letter written by the then 77-year old Jefferson as the first documented usage of the phrase “wolf by the ears” to refer to Black slaves, recent scholars have shown Jefferson to have used the phrase numerous times throughout his life in various contexts and situations.  We thus see Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, author of the Declaration of Independence, foretelling of the same two conditional outcomes soberly articulated in the Kerner Report to be released 147 years in the future. </p>

<h1>Snapshot of Society</h1>
<p>Before providing brief examples of some of the content the book will explore in greater detail, I want to respond to the common attitudes towards change of any significant scale.  To the one who might say, “this has been done before, and it failed, and if it hasn’t been attempted, the reason must be that it’s impossible.”  Self-defeating personalities cannot be convinced to express concern about anything that does not impact them directly, and even then they do not necessarily respond in the manner that logic would dictate.</p>
<p>If the above illogic is true, then we should also hold as truth that inertia of any type is insurmountable, and in the racial predicament we would then face one of two inevitable outcomes:</p>
<p>1)  Racial tension continue to escalate until another civil war breaks out, or</p>
<p>2)  Racial tension will subside and be replaced by mutual understanding</p>
<p>Of those two options, which one is more palatable?  Which one seems more likely to occur? If your answer to these two questions differs, then you are restricted by cognitive dissonance and other information processing biases that will limit your ability to understand how your own choice—let’s refer to it as agency—ultimately impacts your outcome.  If you expect a poor result, then at the unconscious level, you will not commit the effort to achieve anything other than the poor result you expect.  We must acknowledge how serious this topic is. </p>
<p>Everyday, people are dying for no reason whatsoever while we argue, bicker, whine and so forth over matters which can in no way produce resolution.  This is not a mandate for Black Americans, it is a mandate for all Americans.  The world has always been watching, and just like our foreign counterparts admired what they thought was a sincere pledge for freedom in 1776 and again in 1787, they scoffed in utter disbelief and disgust when they came to realize that the American Dilemma had never been addressed with a suitable degree of effort or competence.  As we saw in the Kerner Commission Report earlier, 48 years ago, President Johnson tagged poverty reduction and resolving America’s lingering race crisis as a top priority for his administration.  The issue is no less important today, but for reasons that the book will detail, we have assigned little more than lip service to the quest for a solution.</p>
<h2>Justice System</h2>
<p>The simple fact that the United States leads the world in terms of the portion of the overall population living behind bars.  This is not just with regard to Black men, but true of every sub-population:  White Men, White Women, Hispanic Men, Hispanic Women, and most certainly, Black Men and Black Women as well.  In fact, while the United States’ general population comprises just 5% of the world’s total population, the United States’ prison population constitutes 25% of the world’s prison population.</p>

<br/><p>While the book being produced synthesizes the empirical research from hundreds of studies on various facets of the American (in)justice system, one quote is sufficient to focus the reader’s attention on the significance of this human rights crisis:</p>
<p>""<i>African Americans are 14% of the U.S. population, yet they constitute 28% of arrests, 40% of inmates held in prisons and jails, and 42% of the population on death row. Hispanics and Native Americans are also alarmingly overrepresented in the criminal justice system. This overrepresentation of people of color in the nation’s criminal justice system, also referred to as Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC), is a serious issue in our society.</i>""</p>

<h2>Economy &amp; Work Environment</h2>
<p>Linking the impact of incarceration to the society at-large, Rutgers University Associate Professor of Political Science, Lisa Miller, writes:</p>
<p>""<i>One of the most common scholarly explanations for persistent racial inequities in crime, punishment, and criminal justice is that they represent a continuation of the<b>long history of exclusionary practices</b> in the United States beginning with slavery; continuing through the Jim Crow South, white flight, and race riots in northern ghettos; and culminating most recently in the <b>prison state</b>. Analysis of congressional drug policy, for example, illustrates how race and ethnic imagery have long been smuggled into drug policy debates and can be seen in contemporary discourse about crack cocaine and inner-city blacks</i>.""</p>
<p>~ [<i>The Invisible Black Victim: How American Federalism Perpetuates Racial Inequality in Criminal Justice</i>]</p>
<p>Chronic discrimination persists in all facets of the economy.  Significant Black-Other, not always Black-White gaps exist in home ownership, financial assets (i.e. stocks, bonds, commodities, etc), life insurance, personal savings, access to credit, and the list goes on.  A good example of a modern disparity between Blacks and Non-Whites can be seen between Blacks-Asians in home ownership and wealth, and a historical example of Black-Black disparity can be found between Southern Blacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and Blacks within Native American populations such as Cherokee Freedmen.  In her paper, <i>The One Thing Needful: Land and Black Mobility</i>, Melinda C. Miller describes,</p>
<p>""<i>For income, the difference in the racial gap was estimated between 27% and 43%. By 1900, 90.23% of adults in Cherokee freedmen farming households owned their homes; only 28.34% of farming southern blacks households did. All black adults in the Cherokee Nation were much more likely to live in an owned rather than rented house (84% vs. 24%).</i>""</p>
<p>A majority of the time, the impact appears in subtle and nuanced ways, yet it pervades both public and private sectors, all industries, all regions, and all firm sizes from small local businesses to multi-billion dollar titans in the Fortune 500.  We see a very broad-based pyramid across the board where the proportion of Blacks entering many industries, professions or job families is much closer to the proportion of Blacks in the nation, roughly 14% (13.6% according to the 2010 Census, based on approximately 42 million of Americans, 92.6% of whom declared themselves to be Black or African-American alone, as opposed to declaring mixed racial heritage). </p>
<p>As we head upward from the base of the pyramid, however, a complex myriad of factors and divergent variables offer unsatisfactory explanations—sometimes justification—for statistical anomalies which cannot be refuted by anybody known to be sane and honest.  We see far fewer Blacks in supervisory, managerial and director level positions.  At present, there are more first generation immigrants leading Fortune 500 as CEOs than there are (or have ever been) Blacks leading those same companies.  Pick an industry or a profession, and the story is the same.  Blacks represent 8% of new hires at CPA firms, but less than 1% of partners at those very same firms.  In law firms, a similar finding is true.  Let’s not even mention the executive teams at the largest private equity firms in the United States.  Google them and click through the bio profiles if you need to be convinced.  Remember our blue &amp; red marble discussion from earlier, if over an extended set of observations, the results do not conform to our expected probability distribution, then there is at least one reason explaining why.  Let’s be candid and acknowledge that whether it is due more to choices Blacks make or to a work environment seen as harmful, at some stage nearly every aspiring Black manager steps on a landmine or trapdoor.  The message here is not to tread more carefully; rather the message is that the trapdoors need to be sealed permanently.</p>
<p>The brilliant thinker, psychologist, sociologist, and founder of the Research Center on Group Dynamics at MIT (later moved to University of Michigan)—Kurt Lewin articulated the obstacles to culture change perhaps better than anybody before him, and although he died in 1947, his statements bear great relevance to modern times:</p>
<p>There is no question but that the culture of individuals or small groups can be deeply changed in a relatively short time. A child transplanted from Germany or Japan to America will, as a rule, become thoroughly Americanized. Even grown-ups who are transplanted to a different culture may acquire a new culture to a high degree, and much can be done toward this end through proper education. Experiments with both children and adults prove that the social atmosphere of groups <b><i>can be changed profoundly</i></b> by introducing different forms of leadership. Experiments in leadership training have shown that it is even possible under certain circumstances to transform highly autocratic leaders of long-standing within a short time and efficient credit leaders.  ~ (Lewin, 1943)</p>
<p>What is evident from Lewin’s words above is echoed in contemporary research as well, such as the following praise from Manchester University Professor of Management, Bernard Burnes:</p>
<p>Nor can one say that Lewin’s approach seems dated, based as it is on building understanding, generating learning, gaining new insights, and identifying and testing (and retesting) solutions. Certainly, there seems little evidence that one can achieve peace, reconciliation, co-operation or trust by force. Likewise, in organizations, issues of group effectiveness, behaviour and change have not diminished in the half century since Lewin’s death, though they may often now be labelled differently.</p>

<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Discussing the disparity in healthcare between Blacks and others in the United States, whether we focus on the Black-White, Black-Hispanic, Black-Asian or Black-Other gaps in such varied categories as general mortality, hospitalization, epidemiology, or others, this topic alone could fill volumes of books, and indeed it has. </p>
<p>For our discussion here, I simply want to point to one major aspect of racial disparity, namely the Black-White gap in avoidable mortality (AM).  AM represents causes of death that are not normally expected to occur in countries/regions with available, high-quality healthcare and timely treatment alternatives.  New York University’s James Macinko and the University of Pennsylvania’s Irma Elo studied the Black-White AM gap in a 2009 research paper and the results should alarm all Americans, regardless of race.  The United States—in general—had a higher AM rate than all other OECD nations during the time period studied, while also having the worst trend in AM among these highly-developed nations.  As if that is not alarming enough, prior studies documented that the ratio of Black deaths from twelve specific avoidable causes have hovered at nearly 4.5 to 1 for decades. For the period between 1980 – 2005, Macinko &amp; Elo found that the overall AM ratio between Black and White men varied within a range between 2.3 – 2.7 time to 1, whereas the same ratio with Black and White women oscillated within a range between 2.0 – 2.2 times to 1, which obviously represents a significantly lower average gap as well as a lower range of variation. </p>
<p><b>But the question remains—why is any statistically significant gap considered acceptable?</b></p>
<p>Other studies, which are discussed in your book depict aspects of health-related disparity between Blacks and Whites in terms of quality of life, and show that while Black women tend to outlive their White counterparts, they have significantly shorter active lives, which describes the period of life lived without a substantial impairment due to the onset of mental or physical disability. For men, the picture is bleaker at nearly every step of the way.  Still other studies, which we obviously incorporate into our synthesis for greater impact, reflect the specific demographic and social variables which account for the persistence of these healthcare disparities between Blacks and Whites, such as neighborhood, family composition, and other factors, both environmental and non-environmental in nature.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>During Senator Henry Wilson’s same 1864 address to the 38th Congress that we referenced previously, he stated that the symbols of slavery “<i>disappear from the land they have brutalized, and the school-house will rise to enlighten the darkened intellect of a race imbruted by <b>long years of enforced ignorance</b></i>.” Here is perhaps the earliest known confession and acknowledgement that Black education, more properly miseducation as Carter G. Woodson wrote, is a direct consequence of the oppressive chattel system that persisted for many years indeed. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1272849/files/20150305234040-Trend_in_school_resegregation.PNG?1425627640"" src="""" style=""""/>Source: <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/05/15/school-segregation-civil-rights-project/9115823/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USA Today</a></p>
<br/><p>Over 100 years later, the 1967 Kerner Commission Report stated, “The bleak record of public education for ghetto children is growing <b><i>worse</i></b>. In the critical skills--verbal and reading ability--Negro students are falling further behind whites with each year of school completed.”</p>
<p>Has that improved in the 48 years since?  Sadly, no.  While it barely improved from the Thirteenth Amendment to the Civil Rights era, it has stagnated since. A few additional bulletpoints from the Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Groups from the National Center for Education Statistics’ July 2010 report will provide adequate motivation for our understanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2007, across all racial/ethnic groups <b><i>except Blacks</i></b> and <b><i>American Indians/Alaska Natives</i></b>, the majority of children under 18 lived with married parents. About <b><i>34 percent</i></b> of Black children under 18 lived with married parents and <b><i>56 percent</i></b> of Black children lived with a female parent with no spouse present. (Indicator 3) </li>
<li>The percentages of children who were living in poverty were <b><i>higher for Blacks (34 percent)</i></b>, American Indians/Alaska Natives (33 percent), Hispanics (27 percent), and Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders (26 percent), than for children of two or more races (18 percent), Asians (11 percent) and Whites (10 percent). (Indicator 4) </li>
<li>In 2008, a higher percentage of Asian children (51 percent) had a <b><i>mother with at least a bachelor’s degree</i></b> than did White children (36 percent), children of two or more races (31 percent), Black children (17 percent), American Indian/Alaska Native children (16 percent), and Hispanic children (11 percent). (Indicator 5) </li>
<li>In 2007–08, about <b><i>25 percent</i></b> of secondary mathematics teachers who taught in schools with at least half Black enrollment had <b><i>neither a certification nor a college major</i></b> in mathematics, compared to 8 percent of secondary mathematics teachers who taught in schools with at least half White enrollment. (Indicator 9.1) </li>

<h1>Quick Review</h1>
<p>Perhaps too much information has already been shared in this project summary.  I want that information to become knowledge, so to that end here is a brief step-by-step answer to the question of, well what happened after the Kerner Commission report and why didn’t things improve?</p>
<p>• Assassinations of 1965 and 1968 replaced the outspoken leader with the<i>unassertive status quo maintainers</i>;</p>

<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p>One significant concern to the success of your book is that the rapid pace of rising consumerism and media “noise” related to serious matters addressing socio-economic or racial concerns could drown-out or even crowd-out commitment and support for this project.  To combat this risk, my focus is on engaging with many of the other movements—both nascent and well-established—to engender a spirit of collaboration rather than of competition.  A great many books have been written about topics that “sound similar.”  Further, a great number of non-profit organizations or philanthropic missions have been launched for what might appear to be similar purposes.  I want the viewer / reader to understand without any doubt or uncertainty that what the aforementioned projects and publications share in common is the credit due to the creator. </p>
<p>In other words, authors want to be acknowledged for their intellectual contributions just like donors or philanthropists want acknowledgement for their financial contributions.  I am not seeking fame or status.  I feel compelled to produce this ambitious effort due to the fact that the <b><i>CUMULATIVE COLLECTIVE IMPACT</i></b> of the prior initiatives has been <b><i>negative</i></b>.  It sounds impossible or perhaps even borderline blasphemous, but based purely on the indicators that thousands of independent studies have produced and that this book will synthesize and integrate, after adjusting for human and financial capital differences, the socio-economic plight of the average American has not improved over the past 50 years, and in specific regard to African-Americans, the socio-economic status has deteriorated at an alarmingly accelerated rate.  More young Black males in jail or prison, for longer terms, beginning at earlier average ages upon incarceration; fewer Blacks attending quality schools—education always a lagged effect—but essentially most students who start off behind find themselves increasingly behind (as seen above); college entrance for all sub-groups is up, but the Black-White gap in attendance and dropout rates has widened; after a longer and lower quality average job search (i.e. having been out of work longer), Blacks find themselves in a wide array of discrimination configurations on-the-job; affirmative action plans / programs, when used at all, have been shown to produce negative effects that outweigh the benefit and challenge the validity of the programs overall.</p>
<p>As Justice Potter Stewart wrote just two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King, the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation <b><i>has not kept</i></b>” (emphasis mine; Justice Potter used ‘cannot keep’ where I have inserted ‘has not kept’ for historical emphasis).</p>
<h1>Project Budget</h1>
<p>This budget is divided into three phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Critical Distribution -- covers pre-production (i.e. research tools, support) and production and distribution costs to ship the final book to influential leaders throughout the United States (see Table 1 below);</li>
<li>Book Production Costs -- outside of the production costs that have already been factored into the phase above, we have a need for additional production costs normally associated with publications, and our plan is to raise these in a separate campaign to run simultaneously (see Table 2);</li>
<li>Secondary Distribution -- beyond the elected officials in the first phase of critical distribution (Table 1), we will apply any overage from this campaign (i.e. stretch goals) to sending the book to other influential decision makers as shown in Table 3 below.  Since production costs will have already been recovered during Phase 1, the per book cost of production and shipping during Phase 3 will be $10.</li>
</ol>

Sometimes, it takes an outsider to state the obvious.  This project is about a book & a movement.  The book is nearly finished except for a data-intensive synthesis that will illustrate the social history of the United States in beautiful visualizations that allow readers to learn and understand intuitively without important meanings being lost, buried deep in hundreds of pages of endless prose.  The movement, like the book, is nearly complete as well, except it is currently in a state of deep hibernation.  This is not my project; the project belongs to Americans, past, present and future.I cordially invite you as a teammate in this endeavor if you can make one or more of the following statements:

I love my country, but I don’t necessarily agree with everything that my country has done or is now doing;
Voicing my views, based upon well-informed perspectives rather than on unfounded opinion or baseless ideas is one of the highest expressions of patriotism;
I possess the intellectual curiosity to pursue the truth, the courage and maturity to confront it and all that its implications entail, and the intrepid and unwavering conviction to follow it;
Negativity thwarts progress, scapegoating deflects accountability, interpersonal disagreement does not necessitate interpersonal incivility or hostility;
Talking alone has never changed the world so either be about it, or kindly shut your mouth! 



The word from the draft manuscript gives a good visual for what is going into the book:

Mission

After history had been made in the election of the country’s first Black president, the New York Times reported “Racial barrier falls in decisive victory,” but is that statement really true?  Did a barrier come down, or are we looking at an anomaly?  Here we are in the year 2015, exactly 150 years after the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified by the necessary three-fourths of states. The Amendment was intended to “obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the slave system” which provides the phrase I currently favor as the title of the book.  On March 28, 1864, Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts delivered a long oration in the 1st session of the 38th Congress:
""Sir, slavery in America, though upheld by interests, customs, and usages, trenched about by inhuman statutes, and hedged around by passionate, vehement, and unreasoning prejudices, is fast crumbling into atoms beneath the blows rained upon it by a liberty-loving and patriotic people.  But let anti-slavery men listen to no truce, to no cry for mercy.  Let them now be as inflexible as justice, as inexorable as destiny…
If this amendment shall be incorporated by the will of the nation into the Constitution of the United States, it will obliterate the last lingering vestiges of the slave system; its chattelizing, degrading, and bloody codes; its dark, malignant, barbarizing spirit; all it was and is, everything connected with it or pertaining to it, from the face of the nation it has scarred with moral desolation, from the bosom of the country it has reddened with the blood and strewn with the graves of patriotism.""
Interpreted in the most literal manner, the powers given by the Declaration of Independence and fully embodied in Constitution of the United States, there would be no need for appending articles to assign privileges that were previously deemed as “unalienable rights.” Since chattel slavery was a pre-existing condition at the time of drafting the Declaration of Independence, however, the very presence of slavery as an instrument of the national economy and badge of American culture made it necessary for either an act of Congress or executive order of the President to remove it.  Both occurred, however laws are not sufficient to change culture as they cannot regulate what persists in the hearts and minds of human beings. 
In 1968, after having been ruled in favor of an oppressive defendant seeking to deny an interracial couple the right to purchase a home in a new subdevelopment, upheld by the appellate, in a case finally reached the US Supreme Court.  In the ruling which was reversed in favor of the Black plaintiff, Justice Potter Stewart mentioned the following in his landmark opinion:
""Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery. Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom -- freedom to ""go and come at pleasure"" and to ""buy and sell when they please"" -- would be left with ""a mere paper guarantee"" if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep. ""

Why This? Why Now?
Information that is not used to produce benefit is nothing more than data.  When we apply that information in intelligent and useful manners, then we transform data into knowledge. One core theme for this project is that our society has plenty of informational resources available, yet tragically, our knowledge is inadequately low.  We complain incessantly via social and traditional media, yet rather than taking proactive steps to change or improve the world we live in, we tend to passively listen, view, or otherwise consume incomplete and often erroneous data, sometimes in as small a dose as 140 characters at a time.  Has anything truly monumental ever been accomplished with such superficial techniques?  I am an advocate for technology and as an operations consultant, I have achieved proficiency in more applications than most people will ever use in their entire lifetimes, but none of the technology-enabled activities we have at our disposal today will make a positive impact on our world if we do not first open our minds and our hearts in order to enlighten ourselves as we transform and transcend all that ails us at present.
The information we just mentioned comes from many sources.  There have been thousands of new doctorate degrees awarded since the 1960s in fields such as economics, sociology, history, education, and so many more, but what has the net social impact been? There are nearly one million non-profit organizations registered with the Internal Revenue Service under sub-chapter 501(c)(3), all claiming to have an altruistic mission.  Philanthropists give, foundations spend, corporations donate, and a massive effort from seemingly credible institutions spends hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing and advertising each year to make you and I feel good about ourselves and our financial contributions to “worthwhile” causes. 
Beyond the “feel good” photo opportunities of celebrities and athletes posing with inner city children, despite the apparent “success” of the giving campaigns in your workplace, diseases continue to be manufactured at a higher rate than the drugs themselves (quite convenient for pharmaceutical companies, I know), cancers of every strain continue to adapt, millions of defenseless children are living in unhygienic environments or altogether homeless, and the sad indicators could fill more pages than anybody would have time to read.  And, if you happen to be Black, by nearly every meaningful metric imaginable, the living circumstances of the average African-American—especially younger males—has deteriorated to an alarming extent. 
Lectures at colleges and universities, blogging, etc has failed to move the collective needle of the Black male’s socio-economic status. I am not blaming others for what they have not yet accomplished; rather, I am commending them by leading this initiative to leverage their contributions, synthesize their research, and stand on their shoulders to flip on the switch that has been dark since our nation began.  I have always been amused by historians who refer to the “good old days” nostalgically.  If, like me, you are the descendant of an African slave in America, please remind me when those days occurred, because I cannot seem to remember.  Was it the day when we walked off the plantation, fearing for our lives, pockets and stomachs empty, feet bare, bones and muscles aching, probably incapable of reading a sign on the road and without any practical experience to assist us in navigating our journey to this allegedly wonderful place known as freedom?  Was it when you saw your relative or friend dragged off by a screaming mob to be brutally tarred and feathered or even lynched in a tree—two barbaric acts that even the cruelest humans alive would not likely inflict upon the lowest beast God ever created? 
Was it the day when your relatives or ancestors were sent off to war and deployed in the riskiest tours to be killed at twice the rate of others?  Was it when it seemed like every time you turned your head, another young Black leader was being gunned down in front of his family or friends?  These are questions which we need to stop asking, because in order to heal the wounds—and the wounds are as deep as they are—we need to have the resolve to revise our entire approach to the world as we know it.  We need to shed old paradigms and recognize once and for all that what our predecessors attempted was limited to their generation and their resource constraints, and now we live in a time period where we have the tremendous advantage of hindsight, yet we lack understanding and knowledge. 
At the outset, it is worth clarifying that most people misuse the word ‘equality’ as it refers to race relations.  What the Declaration of Independence and Constitution discuss is equality of opportunity, not equality in all regards.  As a simple illustration, imagine a bag containing marbles of assorted colors. Despite its color, each marble is composed of the same material, has identical weight and is the exact same as all other marbles with regard to other observable physical properties. We learned basic probability in middle school mathematics such that if there are 50 red marbles in the bag and also 50 blue, then we would be surprised to find that after one thousand random trial observations (with replacement), we pulled 750 blue marbles and only 250 red. 

Why does this outcome shock us?  Because we are smart enough to realize that with the same constituent contents, the probability of drawing a red marble is identical to that of drawing a blue marble, exactly 50%.  Anytime we find a pattern of observations that deviates from the expected value, we must conclude that there is something else causing the discrepancy. 
How does our remedial math lesson relate to the Thirteenth Amendment, over which President Abraham Lincoln would lose his life?
Dean of the School of Law at University of Pittsburgh, Michael Carter, Jr offers us a glimpse of the inherent complexity of Article XIII itself based on the cultural environment in which it was hatched.
Carter states “On the whole, however, the Amendment remains under-enforced in comparison to the broad scope the contemplated in its legislative history, the ideology of its drafters, and the historical circumstances in which it was adopted.”
This book uses research contributions from historians, sociologists, economists, legal theorists, psychologists and other notable thinkers, integrates their contributions and in so doing, answers the questions about what went wrong with regard to incomplete implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment.  Most importantly, it paints a picture of what needs to occur, and unlike other books or approaches, places emphasis on the necessary cultural shift that can only be achieved through Americans—representing the diversity and patriotic pluralismthat makes our nation great—increasing their awareness and sensitivity to subtle, often unnoticed or even unconscious factors that while unseen strongly influence the way our society functions.
Ingroups and Outgroups

We have a tendency to only pay attention to things that we believe will benefit us personally.  Although that statement does not appear to be overly controversial, it becomes a challenge for us as a society of overly-individualistic humans who refuse to come to agreement on what resources and means need to be shared—and to what extent—in order for us to sustainably co-exist within a complex network of organic communities, polities, and geographies.  We vary with regard to language, tradition, culture, political orientation, and even in superficial terms of physical attributes like skin color. When we deal with others as we would like to be dealt with, those variations could be a source for greater human understanding as the Quran describes:
""O mankind! We have created you from a single male and a female, and made you into various nations and tribes that you may become better acquainted with one another. Verily, the most honorable of you in the sight of Almighty God are those who have the most piety. Verily, Almighty God is All-Knowing, All-Aware. [Chapter 49, Verse 13]""
On the other hand, when we emphasize the dissimilarity of others, it can easily develop into dangerous interpersonal antagonism, which leads to ingroup bias.  Alfred Adler, one of the most under-appreciated thinkers, physicians, psychologists of the prior century, eloquently articulated the antecedents of ingroup bias.  The more familiar manifestation of ‘ingroup’ in vernacular can be spotted in our usage of the plural pronouns ‘we’ or ‘us.’ 
Adler tells us how the ‘us’ typically develops:
""In our present-day culture, people are still easily misled to isolate themselves, and to separate themselves into nations, creeds, and classes.  In all manners of isolation the familiar traits of ambition and vanity take the particular form of contrasting oneself with the others and of proving, by withdrawing from them, that one is different...Those who have traveled have found people everywhere are approximately the same in that they are always inclined to find something by which to degrade others. Everyone seeks a means which permits him to elevate himselfat little cost."" ~ (Adler, 1927)
Just as one cannot truly know ease without having known hardship, we cannot understand ingroups without also seeking to understand outgroups as well. In order to have an ‘us’ there must exist a target reference group that we refer to as ‘them.’
Below, Adler explains how the ‘them’ can come about:
""Difficulties in earning a livelihood, bad working conditions, inadequate educational and cultural facilities, a joyless existence, and continuous irritation, all these factors increase the feeling of inferiority, produce oversensitivity, and drive the individual to seek ""solutions."" To an individual in this state of mind, any outside interference appears as a threat to his security and rouses him to active or passive self-defense. Motives of hatred appear most clearly in economic disturbances of our time. . . . Destruction means to the masses a release from situations felt intolerable and thus appears to them as a preliminary condition of improvement. "" ~ (Adler, 1925)
Now that we understand these basic concepts, I want to direct our attention to their significance within this book and the broader project’s context.  For Blacks to be discriminated against, there must be a relatively more powerful ingroup who targets Blacks as the outgroup.  Until now, most of the “resistance” to such discrimination, at least as articulated by those who have been anointed as Black leaders in the past, has focused on the blackness of ‘us’ versus the oppressivewhiteness of ‘them.’ This dichotomy of thought—indeed of the more general worldview—plays an instrumental part towards explaining why racial disparity was created and why it has persisted.

In the US context, Adler was not the only pioneer of psychology and sociology to address racial tension and disparity.  Kurt Lewin and Gordon Allport, who we’ll mention more later also made deeply insightful observations, which unfortunately have not been leveraged to the benefit of American society as of yet. This book seeks to change that.  In the height of what we now look back on as the Civil Rights Era in the United States, a massive undertaking to investigate the roots of race tension was launched by executive order of President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
While it is not possible to discuss the results from the Kerner Commission Report in detail, but a soon-to-be written update will provide highlights.  I mention the Kerner Report here, to illustrate how regrettable it was to have conducted a study of that magnitude and significance without having utilized the powerful minds of Adler, Lewin or Allport, none of whom are mentioned within nearly 600 pages of detailed findings, summary and appendixes.  Adler and Lewin had long since passed, and Allport died in 1967, the same year the report was issued, but their writings were obviously available.  If society doesn’t benefit from those whom possess the most knowledge about specific issues of great relevance to the society itself, then it is no wonder we find ourselves moving backwards towards darkness rather than advancing toward the light.  Not even Abraham Maslow, whose insights were sought by Civil Rights’ activists repeatedly in order to help understand the social impact of discrimination, was listed among the hundreds of special advisor or consultants to the Kerner Commission.

Two of the more compelling statements from the Kerner Report’s executive summary published in 1967 should sober our minds enough to understand the relevance to this project and to our nation’s history:
""Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white-- separate andunequal. Reaction to last summer's disorders has quickened the movement and deepened the division...Discrimination and segregation have long permeated much of American life; they now threaten the future of every American. This deepening racial division is not inevitable. The movement apart can be reversed. ""
A third and final statement for this discussion highlights how the fact that the Kerner panel of experts—comprised of major city police chiefs, sociologists, legal theorists, retired judges, political activists, industry executives and economists, among others, happened to omit the human dimension that only an understanding of the mind (i.e. psychology)—is nothing less than a travesty:
""This alternative will require a commitment to national action  --compassionate, massive and sustained, backed by the resources of the most powerful and the richest nation on this earth. From every American it will require new attitudes, new understanding, and, above all, new will.""
If it is not obvious already, the only way the three concluding elements—attitudes, understanding, and will—can be changed is through acquiring a better and more functional understanding of psychology.  Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, fulfilling the promise of the Thirteenth Amendment by obliterating the last lingering vestiges is not a concern of just African-Americans, it is the moral obligation of all Americans!

Not Ancient History
If you ask any serious scholar of American history who they consider the most influential, perhaps even most important historical figure to the founding ideology of the United States, and you might hear different responses, but without any doubt, a near majority will likely mention Thomas Jefferson, and even those who do not mention his name first will almost certainly mention him among the top three most influential Americans of his day, perhaps of all-time.
As a history major and even as a young fan of history, I do not recall ever studying the more controversial statements Jefferson made which helped to define the nature of race relations in this country from its earliest origins, and continue to shape our attitudes today.  Not only did Jefferson elaborate on the social pressures exacerbated by tensions between Whites and Blacks, but he also exposed the hypocrisy buried deep within the very foundation of this nation.  While some historians have attacked Jefferson on account of his slave ownership, insulting remarks alleging biological and genetic inferiority of Blacks, I use Jefferson in this book for a much more instrumental purpose.  Because Jefferson is of central importance to this nation’s philosophical and ideological orientation, more than George Washington as hero, or as Alexander Hamilton as a defender of the republic, Jefferson symbolizes the quintessential point of departure for what has occurred in our society since its political birth in 1776.  Africans were known to have set foot in what is now the Mid-Atlantic region in the 16th century, and African slaves are known to have been forcibly trafficked into colonial Virginia in 1619.  Yet more than these earlier historical milestones Jefferson’s life, from 1743 to 1826 is a symbol.  His writings, more than his actions, established the longstanding patronizing attitudes that Blacks could only survive under the White man’s care and supervision.  Jefferson’s writings also foretold of the explosive conditions that would emerge in the aftermath of the slave system..  In an 1820 letter written to John Holmesone of the chief architects of the Missouri Compromise which admitted Maine to the union as a free state while accepting Missouri’s union entry as a slave state, Jefferson wrote:
""I can say, with conscious truth, that there is not a man on earth who would sacrifice more than I would to relieve us from this heavy reproach, in any practicable way. The cession of that kind of property, for so it is misnamed, is a bagatelle which would not cost me a second thought, if, in that way, a general emancipation and expatriation could be effected; and gradually, and with due sacrifices, I think it might be. But as it is, we have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither hold him, nor safely let him go. Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in the other.""

Interestingly enough, while some historians point to this letter written by the then 77-year old Jefferson as the first documented usage of the phrase “wolf by the ears” to refer to Black slaves, recent scholars have shown Jefferson to have used the phrase numerous times throughout his life in various contexts and situations.  We thus see Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, author of the Declaration of Independence, foretelling of the same two conditional outcomes soberly articulated in the Kerner Report to be released 147 years in the future.

Snapshot of Society
Before providing brief examples of some of the content the book will explore in greater detail, I want to respond to the common attitudes towards change of any significant scale.  To the one who might say, “this has been done before, and it failed, and if it hasn’t been attempted, the reason must be that it’s impossible.”  Self-defeating personalities cannot be convinced to express concern about anything that does not impact them directly, and even then they do not necessarily respond in the manner that logic would dictate.
If the above illogic is true, then we should also hold as truth that inertia of any type is insurmountable, and in the racial predicament we would then face one of two inevitable outcomes:
1)  Racial tension continue to escalate until another civil war breaks out, or
2)  Racial tension will subside and be replaced by mutual understanding
Of those two options, which one is more palatable?  Which one seems more likely to occur? If your answer to these two questions differs, then you are restricted by cognitive dissonance and other information processing biases that will limit your ability to understand how your own choice—let’s refer to it as agency—ultimately impacts your outcome.  If you expect a poor result, then at the unconscious level, you will not commit the effort to achieve anything other than the poor result you expect.  We must acknowledge how serious this topic is. 
Everyday, people are dying for no reason whatsoever while we argue, bicker, whine and so forth over matters which can in no way produce resolution.  This is not a mandate for Black Americans, it is a mandate for all Americans.  The world has always been watching, and just like our foreign counterparts admired what they thought was a sincere pledge for freedom in 1776 and again in 1787, they scoffed in utter disbelief and disgust when they came to realize that the American Dilemma had never been addressed with a suitable degree of effort or competence.  As we saw in the Kerner Commission Report earlier, 48 years ago, President Johnson tagged poverty reduction and resolving America’s lingering race crisis as a top priority for his administration.  The issue is no less important today, but for reasons that the book will detail, we have assigned little more than lip service to the quest for a solution.
Justice System
The simple fact that the United States leads the world in terms of the portion of the overall population living behind bars.  This is not just with regard to Black men, but true of every sub-population:  White Men, White Women, Hispanic Men, Hispanic Women, and most certainly, Black Men and Black Women as well.  In fact, while the United States’ general population comprises just 5% of the world’s total population, the United States’ prison population constitutes 25% of the world’s prison population.

While the book being produced synthesizes the empirical research from hundreds of studies on various facets of the American (in)justice system, one quote is sufficient to focus the reader’s attention on the significance of this human rights crisis:
""African Americans are 14% of the U.S. population, yet they constitute 28% of arrests, 40% of inmates held in prisons and jails, and 42% of the population on death row. Hispanics and Native Americans are also alarmingly overrepresented in the criminal justice system. This overrepresentation of people of color in the nation’s criminal justice system, also referred to as Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC), is a serious issue in our society.""

Economy & Work Environment
Linking the impact of incarceration to the society at-large, Rutgers University Associate Professor of Political Science, Lisa Miller, writes:
""One of the most common scholarly explanations for persistent racial inequities in crime, punishment, and criminal justice is that they represent a continuation of thelong history of exclusionary practices in the United States beginning with slavery; continuing through the Jim Crow South, white flight, and race riots in northern ghettos; and culminating most recently in the prison state. Analysis of congressional drug policy, for example, illustrates how race and ethnic imagery have long been smuggled into drug policy debates and can be seen in contemporary discourse about crack cocaine and inner-city blacks.""
~ [The Invisible Black Victim: How American Federalism Perpetuates Racial Inequality in Criminal Justice]
Chronic discrimination persists in all facets of the economy.  Significant Black-Other, not always Black-White gaps exist in home ownership, financial assets (i.e. stocks, bonds, commodities, etc), life insurance, personal savings, access to credit, and the list goes on.  A good example of a modern disparity between Blacks and Non-Whites can be seen between Blacks-Asians in home ownership and wealth, and a historical example of Black-Black disparity can be found between Southern Blacks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and Blacks within Native American populations such as Cherokee Freedmen.  In her paper, The One Thing Needful: Land and Black Mobility, Melinda C. Miller describes,
""For income, the difference in the racial gap was estimated between 27% and 43%. By 1900, 90.23% of adults in Cherokee freedmen farming households owned their homes; only 28.34% of farming southern blacks households did. All black adults in the Cherokee Nation were much more likely to live in an owned rather than rented house (84% vs. 24%).""
A majority of the time, the impact appears in subtle and nuanced ways, yet it pervades both public and private sectors, all industries, all regions, and all firm sizes from small local businesses to multi-billion dollar titans in the Fortune 500.  We see a very broad-based pyramid across the board where the proportion of Blacks entering many industries, professions or job families is much closer to the proportion of Blacks in the nation, roughly 14% (13.6% according to the 2010 Census, based on approximately 42 million of Americans, 92.6% of whom declared themselves to be Black or African-American alone, as opposed to declaring mixed racial heritage). 
As we head upward from the base of the pyramid, however, a complex myriad of factors and divergent variables offer unsatisfactory explanations—sometimes justification—for statistical anomalies which cannot be refuted by anybody known to be sane and honest.  We see far fewer Blacks in supervisory, managerial and director level positions.  At present, there are more first generation immigrants leading Fortune 500 as CEOs than there are (or have ever been) Blacks leading those same companies.  Pick an industry or a profession, and the story is the same.  Blacks represent 8% of new hires at CPA firms, but less than 1% of partners at those very same firms.  In law firms, a similar finding is true.  Let’s not even mention the executive teams at the largest private equity firms in the United States.  Google them and click through the bio profiles if you need to be convinced.  Remember our blue & red marble discussion from earlier, if over an extended set of observations, the results do not conform to our expected probability distribution, then there is at least one reason explaining why.  Let’s be candid and acknowledge that whether it is due more to choices Blacks make or to a work environment seen as harmful, at some stage nearly every aspiring Black manager steps on a landmine or trapdoor.  The message here is not to tread more carefully; rather the message is that the trapdoors need to be sealed permanently.
The brilliant thinker, psychologist, sociologist, and founder of the Research Center on Group Dynamics at MIT (later moved to University of Michigan)—Kurt Lewin articulated the obstacles to culture change perhaps better than anybody before him, and although he died in 1947, his statements bear great relevance to modern times:
There is no question but that the culture of individuals or small groups can be deeply changed in a relatively short time. A child transplanted from Germany or Japan to America will, as a rule, become thoroughly Americanized. Even grown-ups who are transplanted to a different culture may acquire a new culture to a high degree, and much can be done toward this end through proper education. Experiments with both children and adults prove that the social atmosphere of groups can be changed profoundly by introducing different forms of leadership. Experiments in leadership training have shown that it is even possible under certain circumstances to transform highly autocratic leaders of long-standing within a short time and efficient credit leaders.  ~ (Lewin, 1943)
What is evident from Lewin’s words above is echoed in contemporary research as well, such as the following praise from Manchester University Professor of Management, Bernard Burnes:
Nor can one say that Lewin’s approach seems dated, based as it is on building understanding, generating learning, gaining new insights, and identifying and testing (and retesting) solutions. Certainly, there seems little evidence that one can achieve peace, reconciliation, co-operation or trust by force. Likewise, in organizations, issues of group effectiveness, behaviour and change have not diminished in the half century since Lewin’s death, though they may often now be labelled differently.

Healthcare
Discussing the disparity in healthcare between Blacks and others in the United States, whether we focus on the Black-White, Black-Hispanic, Black-Asian or Black-Other gaps in such varied categories as general mortality, hospitalization, epidemiology, or others, this topic alone could fill volumes of books, and indeed it has. 
For our discussion here, I simply want to point to one major aspect of racial disparity, namely the Black-White gap in avoidable mortality (AM).  AM represents causes of death that are not normally expected to occur in countries/regions with available, high-quality healthcare and timely treatment alternatives.  New York University’s James Macinko and the University of Pennsylvania’s Irma Elo studied the Black-White AM gap in a 2009 research paper and the results should alarm all Americans, regardless of race.  The United States—in general—had a higher AM rate than all other OECD nations during the time period studied, while also having the worst trend in AM among these highly-developed nations.  As if that is not alarming enough, prior studies documented that the ratio of Black deaths from twelve specific avoidable causes have hovered at nearly 4.5 to 1 for decades. For the period between 1980 – 2005, Macinko & Elo found that the overall AM ratio between Black and White men varied within a range between 2.3 – 2.7 time to 1, whereas the same ratio with Black and White women oscillated within a range between 2.0 – 2.2 times to 1, which obviously represents a significantly lower average gap as well as a lower range of variation. 
But the question remains—why is any statistically significant gap considered acceptable?
Other studies, which are discussed in your book depict aspects of health-related disparity between Blacks and Whites in terms of quality of life, and show that while Black women tend to outlive their White counterparts, they have significantly shorter active lives, which describes the period of life lived without a substantial impairment due to the onset of mental or physical disability. For men, the picture is bleaker at nearly every step of the way.  Still other studies, which we obviously incorporate into our synthesis for greater impact, reflect the specific demographic and social variables which account for the persistence of these healthcare disparities between Blacks and Whites, such as neighborhood, family composition, and other factors, both environmental and non-environmental in nature.

Education
During Senator Henry Wilson’s same 1864 address to the 38th Congress that we referenced previously, he stated that the symbols of slavery “disappear from the land they have brutalized, and the school-house will rise to enlighten the darkened intellect of a race imbruted by long years of enforced ignorance.” Here is perhaps the earliest known confession and acknowledgement that Black education, more properly miseducation as Carter G. Woodson wrote, is a direct consequence of the oppressive chattel system that persisted for many years indeed. 
Source: USA Today
Over 100 years later, the 1967 Kerner Commission Report stated, “The bleak record of public education for ghetto children is growing worse. In the critical skills--verbal and reading ability--Negro students are falling further behind whites with each year of school completed.”
Has that improved in the 48 years since?  Sadly, no.  While it barely improved from the Thirteenth Amendment to the Civil Rights era, it has stagnated since. A few additional bulletpoints from the Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Groups from the National Center for Education Statistics’ July 2010 report will provide adequate motivation for our understanding:

In 2007, across all racial/ethnic groups except Blacks and American Indians/Alaska Natives, the majority of children under 18 lived with married parents. About 34 percent of Black children under 18 lived with married parents and 56 percent of Black children lived with a female parent with no spouse present. (Indicator 3) 
The percentages of children who were living in poverty were higher for Blacks (34 percent), American Indians/Alaska Natives (33 percent), Hispanics (27 percent), and Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders (26 percent), than for children of two or more races (18 percent), Asians (11 percent) and Whites (10 percent). (Indicator 4) 
In 2008, a higher percentage of Asian children (51 percent) had a mother with at least a bachelor’s degree than did White children (36 percent), children of two or more races (31 percent), Black children (17 percent), American Indian/Alaska Native children (16 percent), and Hispanic children (11 percent). (Indicator 5) 
In 2007–08, about 25 percent of secondary mathematics teachers who taught in schools with at least half Black enrollment had neither a certification nor a college major in mathematics, compared to 8 percent of secondary mathematics teachers who taught in schools with at least half White enrollment. (Indicator 9.1)

Quick Review
Perhaps too much information has already been shared in this project summary.  I want that information to become knowledge, so to that end here is a brief step-by-step answer to the question of, well what happened after the Kerner Commission report and why didn’t things improve?
• Assassinations of 1965 and 1968 replaced the outspoken leader with theunassertive status quo maintainers;
• Immediate aftermath of Vietnam caused the entire nation to re-assess the class dynamic—a new breed of sociologists emerged to study phenomena with no tangible impact, because they failed to integrate their observations with those from other academic disciplines;
• OPEC jarred manufacturing industry, industrial productivity lags, which eventually paves way for financialization;
• Black middle class grows in uncontested & artificially-protected sectors creating a new “Black Elite;”
• Financialization accelerates, prison sentencing norms become more restrictive;
• High quantity of lower quality educational opportunities emerge, widening the Black-White knowledge/attainment gap……….Welcome to the 21st century!!!
Risks & Challenges
One significant concern to the success of your book is that the rapid pace of rising consumerism and media “noise” related to serious matters addressing socio-economic or racial concerns could drown-out or even crowd-out commitment and support for this project.  To combat this risk, my focus is on engaging with many of the other movements—both nascent and well-established—to engender a spirit of collaboration rather than of competition.  A great many books have been written about topics that “sound similar.”  Further, a great number of non-profit organizations or philanthropic missions have been launched for what might appear to be similar purposes.  I want the viewer / reader to understand without any doubt or uncertainty that what the aforementioned projects and publications share in common is the credit due to the creator. 
In other words, authors want to be acknowledged for their intellectual contributions just like donors or philanthropists want acknowledgement for their financial contributions.  I am not seeking fame or status.  I feel compelled to produce this ambitious effort due to the fact that the CUMULATIVE COLLECTIVE IMPACT of the prior initiatives has been negative.  It sounds impossible or perhaps even borderline blasphemous, but based purely on the indicators that thousands of independent studies have produced and that this book will synthesize and integrate, after adjusting for human and financial capital differences, the socio-economic plight of the average American has not improved over the past 50 years, and in specific regard to African-Americans, the socio-economic status has deteriorated at an alarmingly accelerated rate.  More young Black males in jail or prison, for longer terms, beginning at earlier average ages upon incarceration; fewer Blacks attending quality schools—education always a lagged effect—but essentially most students who start off behind find themselves increasingly behind (as seen above); college entrance for all sub-groups is up, but the Black-White gap in attendance and dropout rates has widened; after a longer and lower quality average job search (i.e. having been out of work longer), Blacks find themselves in a wide array of discrimination configurations on-the-job; affirmative action plans / programs, when used at all, have been shown to produce negative effects that outweigh the benefit and challenge the validity of the programs overall.
As Justice Potter Stewart wrote just two months after the assassination of Martin Luther King, the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation has not kept” (emphasis mine; Justice Potter used ‘cannot keep’ where I have inserted ‘has not kept’ for historical emphasis).
Project Budget
This budget is divided into three phases:

Critical Distribution -- covers pre-production (i.e. research tools, support) and production and distribution costs to ship the final book to influential leaders throughout the United States (see Table 1 below);
Book Production Costs -- outside of the production costs that have already been factored into the phase above, we have a need for additional production costs normally associated with publications, and our plan is to raise these in a separate campaign to run simultaneously (see Table 2);
Secondary Distribution -- beyond the elected officials in the first phase of critical distribution (Table 1), we will apply any overage from this campaign (i.e. stretch goals) to sending the book to other influential decision makers as shown in Table 3 below.  Since production costs will have already been recovered during Phase 1, the per book cost of production and shipping during Phase 3 will be $10.

debt. Prior to the formation of Bridge to Justice, Bruce practiced labor
 and employment law and general civil litigation at a corporate law firm
 in New York City. After relocating to Boulder in 2009, Bruce 
volunteered for Boulder County Legal Services and worked as a staff 
attorney for the Boulder Law Shop representing modest means clients in 
family law and landlord-tenant matters.In

2012.Education:

Colorado Supreme Court Pro Bono Legal Service Commitment and Recognition Program, 2013-2015                                               Samantha Bainbridge, Staff AttorneySamantha Bainbridge is the newest addition to Bridge to Justice. Samantha
 knew a legal career was in her future after volunteering with Community
 Legal Aid (CLA) in Worcester, Massachusetts while in college and 
witnessing the enormous impact that attorneys have on resolving problems
 that seem insurmountable without legal help. She returned to legal aid 
as an AmeriCorps Fellow, assisting indigent individuals with government 
benefit and landlord-tenant issues. While in law school pursuing a 
career in public interest law, Samantha interned with the Colorado Legal
 Services Family and Children Unit, the 18th Judicial District, Denver 
Urban Ministries Pro Bono Legal Clinic, and the Department of Education 
Office for Civil Rights. She observed the frustration of individuals 
trying to navigate complicated areas of law without qualified advice and
 the drastic difference that dedicated attorneys can make in achieving 
positive outcomes and peace of mind.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAUSEFor those who cannot make a monetary contribution to Bridge to Justice but still wish to support its mission of providing equal access to justice for low-to-moderate income Coloradans, there are plenty of ways to contribute. Here are just a few ideas of ways you can help!Volunteer: Organizations providing legal assistance to modest income clients are often looking for volunteers to help them with a variety of tasks, including translating, organizing files and resources, and engaging with clients. Having this help available enables these organizations to expand their client base and continue to reach out to more community members in need of affordable legal services. Spread the Word: In order for Bridge to Justice to help as many people as possible, communities throughout Colorado first must know that Bridge to Justice is available. Those who feel it is their only option to navigate the justice system alone deserve to know that our doors are open to them, and we cannot spread this message to every modest-income Colorado household without your help!Start the Conversation in Your Community: One reason why the justice gap has been able to grow to such startling proportions is because this phenomenon often goes overlooked amongst lay community members and legal practitioners alike. It is up to us and those who support our mission to continue to act as catalysts for change. We must engage one another in this conversation and reach out to others as well. Through these efforts, we can create networks of support with collective voices that speak louder that of any individual.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>What do Dan Akroyd, Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, and Simone Biles have in common? They are all neurodistinct! </h2>
<p>Link OT’s mission is to link neurodistinct talents to job opportunities. The problem is that the vast majority of people (and employers) do not accept and APPRECIATE what it means to think differently. This lack of understanding results in homogenous thinking and cultural norms, which stifles new ideas and ways of thinking. Bigotry, anti-intellectualism, and marginalization are just a few of the inherent risks when diverse thinking isn’t embraced.</p>
<p>Neurodiverse conditions include Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, and more. Further, 17% of the US population can be considered neurodistinct. Yet, this segment of our population encounters unemployment rates as high as 80%! On the flip side, many companies, such as Microsoft and HP, have uncovered the unique value of integrating diverse thinking into their workforce. Research also indicates that hiring neurodistict talent results in greater productivity, creativity, innovation, and work engagement in comparison to peers. So, where is the breakdown happening and what do we do about it?? This is where the Link team comes in! </p>
<p>I started Link OT with the mission to change the narrative, break down barriers, reduce the stigma, and change perspectives about diverse thinking in the workplace.

</div></div>","What do Dan Akroyd, Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, and Simone Biles have in common? They are all neurodistinct! 
Link OT’s mission is to link neurodistinct talents to job opportunities. The problem is that the vast majority of people (and employers) do not accept and APPRECIATE what it means to think differently. This lack of understanding results in homogenous thinking and cultural norms, which stifles new ideas and ways of thinking. Bigotry, anti-intellectualism, and marginalization are just a few of the inherent risks when diverse thinking isn’t embraced.
Neurodiverse conditions include Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, and more. Further, 17% of the US population can be considered neurodistinct. Yet, this segment of our population encounters unemployment rates as high as 80%! On the flip side, many companies, such as Microsoft and HP, have uncovered the unique value of integrating diverse thinking into their workforce. Research also indicates that hiring neurodistict talent results in greater productivity, creativity, innovation, and work engagement in comparison to peers. So, where is the breakdown happening and what do we do about it?? This is where the Link team comes in! 
I started Link OT with the mission to change the narrative, break down barriers, reduce the stigma, and change perspectives about diverse thinking in the workplace. We help our clients FIND & KEEP JOBS while also assisting employers in development of NEURO-INCLUSIVE hiring, onboarding, integration, and retention practices.

Many reasons, but one major reason is this:Because of the true nature of conditions of a lot of the shelters and other services the city provides, and the lack of awareness of this by the city, for the most part homeless people are safer and more comfortable sleeping on the street, so the government often deems them as “service resistant”, or essentially “If they choose to stay on the street, that’s their choice”.This is why its vital through this project and campaign, that we expose to the city what conditions are really like of some of the services it provides, and how the steps a homeless person has to take to get off the streets are near impossible, when deprived of their essential needs like food and a roof over their head.There couldn’t be a more compelling way to expose this than with our approach - video interviews with the homeless, aimed at directly addressing the problems in the system, targeted at the Mayor and government, and outlining a proven workable solution.  Who is the team at the moment?Matt Baker: Creator, Director of Photography, editor, content/project manager.  Molly Bareiss: Editor Ben Cassara: Assistant and Audio.  Katie Barbaree: Assistant and Audio.Hakook team: Josh Dean, Isaac MarshallWebsite: Voicesofthestreet.com Facebook: VoicesOfTheStreetNYC   VoicesOfTheStreet.com#ItsTimeWeListened  Other Ways You Can HelpSharing this link helps of course, on Facebook, email and other social media!
