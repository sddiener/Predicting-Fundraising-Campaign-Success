<p>PREMIERS PAS D’UN JEUNE POÈTE</p>

<p>Né en 1956, l’année du Bois du Casier et du 20<sup>ème</sup> Congrès de Moscou, Serge Noël est un militant de la gauche radicale, pacifiste, féministe et antiraciste depuis l'âge de 14 ans.

<p>Hi Indiegogo!</p>
<p>I’m Keith.
From Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As you may
well know, Hong Kong is an international city, where every day, each one of us
competes against each other in order to succeed. We all want to get a good grade
and find well-paid jobs. However, it seems that we are all fighting without
purpose, a fight in which there are no survivors. Over the past two decades
this daily fight with the status quo has taken its toll on me.</p>
<p>Until one day when I asked myself: Why was I
put on the earth?</p>
<p>I don’t
want to live a life of regret, with survival as its goal. Instead, I want my
life to be bristling with energy, adventure and enthusiasm. With that in mind,
I put down my work, picked up a backpack, and set out to explore the world and embrace
whatever new challenges it threw at me.</p>
<p>My journey began
in September 2014. Since then, I have traveled to 15 different countries, to
what was more than 40 cities all over Asia and Europe. Every two weeks I set
out to a different place and, like most people, whenever I go to a new
destination, I experience what the city has best to offer by sightseeing. However,
unlike most people, the way I get to meet local people and experience these new
countries and cultures, is by attending a Startup Weekend event.</p>
<p>Startup
Weekend is an event which takes place in different cities across the world,
throughout the whole year. In it, participants have a chance to make their idea
a reality. For 54 hours, teams are formed and ideas are conceptualised and
refined. At the end a finished product or prototype is pitched to a select
group of elite judges. </p>
<p>Through my
travels to these events, I have met thousands of interesting people, worked on
dozens of projects, been presented with truly revolutionising ideas, not to
mention that I have seen more than 500 live pitches. These events provided me
with what I was missing back in Hong Kong: a way to turn my knowledge and
skills into a business and make it a reality. With my acute engineering design
sense, I have helped several projects in getting their prototype to the very
next level and, having had so much exposure to this environment previously, I
very much enjoy inspiring others with my experience and knowledge-sharing.</p>
<p>I look to experience
a wide variety of cultures, challenges and ways of working. It truly has been a
fascinating story and one which I am willing to share. I am going on a new
adventure to the United States of America in this coming summer but for that I
need your help. Every cent of your donation will facilitate my next trip to the
country. You can also support me by booking me a flight, train or bus ticket,
or by simply giving me a safe place to rest.</p>
<p>Regardless
of whether you are young or old, an educator, a traveler like myself, a
start-upper, or even a businessman, I believe you would like to hear my story.
I will share with you my tips and tricks on how to manage money during travel
and which attractions are worth visiting if you are pressed for time when you
visit a city. Moreover, I will share with you my experiences with different
cultures of eastern and western countries, some crucial elements in a startup
company, and about anything interesting that I have learnt during my “startup
travels”.</p>
<p>By
supporting me on this journey, you can get my designed postcard, poster, and
written book. I may even have the chance to lead you to experience the fast
pace of life in Hong Kong. I look forward to our journey together. Thank you.</p>
<p>Please support me!</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Keith NG</p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why did you launch a crowd-funding campaign?</b></p>
<p>Many of my
friends and individuals whom I have met throughout my travels want to hear my
story, but I don't have time to share it one by one. The solution is then to
record my journey’s learnings inside a book. However this requires money.
Furthermore I am passionate about what I do and I would like to share my design
works, postcards and posters with the world. </p>
<p><b>How will you spend the money you earn here?</b></p>
<p>After
deducting the fee to Indiegogo, part of the money would cover the cost of
publication, rewards production, as well as delivery cost. The other part would
go towards supporting my journey, with expenses including transportation fees,
apartment rent and meals.</p>
<p><b>Why is your aim for this crowd-funding campaign $2000?</b></p>
<p>I set
$2,000 as a goal because it is not too difficult to reach, so people can hear
my story. I'll stay in the US for 3 months and go on a total of 10 trips whilst
in the country. I estimated the expenses at $10/day for dining, $250/trip for
transportation, and $2,000/month for renting an apartment (surely some days
would be couch-surfing). These expenses will be complemented with my savings.</p>
<p><b>Why do I need to hear your story? </b></p>
<p>There are
several reasons. First of all, I am probably the very first person to travel
around the world joining startup competitions everywhere I visit. Second, I am
one of a very few select group of students who studied in mainland China and
Finland, two extreme educational systems. Third, I have learnt very useful methods
to manage time and money as well as ways to balance study and travel. Fourth,
you will be exposed to many amazing projects born in Startup Weekend events in different
countries, which you treat as reference. Last but not least, you can see the
power of Startup Weekend and its community. To sum up, I believe it to be a
special story, which can inspire you.</p>
<p><b>What is inside the book?</b></p>
<p>I am still planning the structure of the book,
but the following topics will be covered:</p>
<p>Travel:
Introduction to the places I have traveled to, some attractions that are worth
visiting when pressed for time as well as my routines whilst I was there.</p>
<p>Startup: My favorite projects in each Startup Weekend. The projects I worked on, things that changed my life and the way I think, interesting
stories from my teams, the crucial elements of winning a pitch and tips and
tricks on team management while a company is in the startup period. In sum, all
of what I learnt while at a Startup Weekend event, be it business or otherwise,
will be covered.</p>
<p>Money: The
system I used to manage different currencies, tips and tricks on how to save
money the “Keith way” ;)</p>
<p>Time: How to
balance out study and travel as well as effective ways to properly manage your
time and energy.</p>
<p>Education: What
I have learnt about the different cultures across all the places I have
traveled to as well as differences in education in mainland China and Finland.</p>
<p><b>Besides money, what kind of assistance do you
need?</b></p>
<p>The number
one thing you can do to help me is to kindly share it with your friends. While
I am finding a base to settle in the San Francisco region to stay during the
weekdays, I will go traveling during the weekends. I would thus highly
appreciate if anyone could provide me with a couch-surfing place or with a fair
rental fee.</p>
<p><b>Hey! Are you being paid to advertise Startup
Weekend?</b></p>
<p>No. Startup
Weekend is a non-profit event. I just want to share my story which is a travel
journey with Startup Weekends.</p>
<p><b>Why is the delivery day so late?</b></p>
<p>I am
confident that I can finish the first draft of the book within 3 months after I
come back to Hong Kong from my USA travels. However, since I am not a native
English speaker or writer, I need to send it to my friends for proof-reading
and review. Hence, I scheduled to publish and deliver my first book in March
2016.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><b>Startup Weekend</b> is a 54-hour event where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups!</p>
<p>On Friday evening, attendees have 1 minute to pitch their new idea, and try to inspire others to join their team. With a team of designer(s), developer(s) and people with a business background, they can begin building their startup. </p>
<p>During Saturday and Sunday, teams implement the lean startup methodology. They do market research, construct a business model, design prototypes, validate the concept with potential customers, etc. </p>
<p>On Sunday night, each team presents their business model and demonstrates the minimal viable product to a panel of judges. The winning teams are awarded with amazing prizes and often go on to start real business after the event!</p>
<p>Startup Weekend is a non-profit event, where the local organizing team consists of volunteers. They seek sponsorships to reduce the ticket price, so more dreamers can gather in one place, and make miracles happen in 54 hours. They are truly awesome!</p>
<p>As stated in Startup Weekend’s official webpage, 1,500+ events have already taken place in over 726 cities. Out of these, over 13,000 startups were created and more than 123,000 entrepreneurs participated. Check it out and join the movement at: <a href=""http://startupweekend.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://startupweekend.org/</a></p>
<p>This is where you will probably find Keith in the coming weekends ;)</p>

</div></div>","Hi Indiegogo!
I’m Keith.
From Hong Kong.
As you may
well know, Hong Kong is an international city, where every day, each one of us
competes against each other in order to succeed. We all want to get a good grade
and find well-paid jobs. However, it seems that we are all fighting without
purpose, a fight in which there are no survivors. Over the past two decades
this daily fight with the status quo has taken its toll on me.
Until one day when I asked myself: Why was I
put on the earth?
I don’t
want to live a life of regret, with survival as its goal. Instead, I want my
life to be bristling with energy, adventure and enthusiasm. With that in mind,
I put down my work, picked up a backpack, and set out to explore the world and embrace
whatever new challenges it threw at me.
My journey began
in September 2014. Since then, I have traveled to 15 different countries, to
what was more than 40 cities all over Asia and Europe. Every two weeks I set
out to a different place and, like most people, whenever I go to a new
destination, I experience what the city has best to offer by sightseeing. However,
unlike most people, the way I get to meet local people and experience these new
countries and cultures, is by attending a Startup Weekend event.
Startup
Weekend is an event which takes place in different cities across the world,
throughout the whole year. In it, participants have a chance to make their idea
a reality. For 54 hours, teams are formed and ideas are conceptualised and
refined. At the end a finished product or prototype is pitched to a select
group of elite judges. 
Through my
travels to these events, I have met thousands of interesting people, worked on
dozens of projects, been presented with truly revolutionising ideas, not to
mention that I have seen more than 500 live pitches. These events provided me
with what I was missing back in Hong Kong: a way to turn my knowledge and
skills into a business and make it a reality. With my acute engineering design
sense, I have helped several projects in getting their prototype to the very
next level and, having had so much exposure to this environment previously, I
very much enjoy inspiring others with my experience and knowledge-sharing.
I look to experience
a wide variety of cultures, challenges and ways of working. It truly has been a
fascinating story and one which I am willing to share. I am going on a new
adventure to the United States of America in this coming summer but for that I
need your help. Every cent of your donation will facilitate my next trip to the
country. You can also support me by booking me a flight, train or bus ticket,
or by simply giving me a safe place to rest.
Regardless
of whether you are young or old, an educator, a traveler like myself, a
start-upper, or even a businessman, I believe you would like to hear my story.
I will share with you my tips and tricks on how to manage money during travel
and which attractions are worth visiting if you are pressed for time when you
visit a city. Moreover, I will share with you my experiences with different
cultures of eastern and western countries, some crucial elements in a startup
company, and about anything interesting that I have learnt during my “startup
travels”.
By
supporting me on this journey, you can get my designed postcard, poster, and
written book. I may even have the chance to lead you to experience the fast
pace of life in Hong Kong. I look forward to our journey together. Thank you.
Please support me!
Kind Regards,
Keith NG
Keith was
born and raised in Hong Kong, where he lived for 20 years. Currently, he is an
undergraduate student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, studying
Industrial and Systems Engineering as a major subject and Product Engineering
with Marketing as a minor. He is passionate about design, technology, product
development, as well as entrepreneurship.
He
treasures the chance of being an international exchange student, and lives a
dual-life, spending his weekends traveling while catching up with studying on
weekdays. He is a practical learner, who wants to ""have his hands
dirty"" and transform ideas into reality. He is an outgoing person who
likes to learn and share new cultures with foreigners, as well as exploring all
sorts of new things. Upon recognising who he was and what made him excited about
life, Keith decided to start a “Startup Travel”.
You are
welcome to contact Keith by email, by kindly sending a message to thestartuptraveler@gmail.com 







* All donors will be listed in my book.

** The Startup Traveler will only be published if $2,000 is achieved in this campaign. (InDemand project)




Why did you launch a crowd-funding campaign?
Many of my
friends and individuals whom I have met throughout my travels want to hear my
story, but I don't have time to share it one by one. The solution is then to
record my journey’s learnings inside a book. However this requires money.
Furthermore I am passionate about what I do and I would like to share my design
works, postcards and posters with the world. 
How will you spend the money you earn here?
After
deducting the fee to Indiegogo, part of the money would cover the cost of
publication, rewards production, as well as delivery cost. The other part would
go towards supporting my journey, with expenses including transportation fees,
apartment rent and meals.
Why is your aim for this crowd-funding campaign $2000?
I set
$2,000 as a goal because it is not too difficult to reach, so people can hear
my story. I'll stay in the US for 3 months and go on a total of 10 trips whilst
in the country. I estimated the expenses at $10/day for dining, $250/trip for
transportation, and $2,000/month for renting an apartment (surely some days
would be couch-surfing). These expenses will be complemented with my savings.
Why do I need to hear your story? 
There are
several reasons. First of all, I am probably the very first person to travel
around the world joining startup competitions everywhere I visit. Second, I am
one of a very few select group of students who studied in mainland China and
Finland, two extreme educational systems. Third, I have learnt very useful methods
to manage time and money as well as ways to balance study and travel. Fourth,
you will be exposed to many amazing projects born in Startup Weekend events in different
countries, which you treat as reference. Last but not least, you can see the
power of Startup Weekend and its community. To sum up, I believe it to be a
special story, which can inspire you.
What is inside the book?
I am still planning the structure of the book,
but the following topics will be covered:
Travel:
Introduction to the places I have traveled to, some attractions that are worth
visiting when pressed for time as well as my routines whilst I was there.
Startup: My favorite projects in each Startup Weekend. The projects I worked on, things that changed my life and the way I think, interesting
stories from my teams, the crucial elements of winning a pitch and tips and
tricks on team management while a company is in the startup period. In sum, all
of what I learnt while at a Startup Weekend event, be it business or otherwise,
will be covered.
Money: The
system I used to manage different currencies, tips and tricks on how to save
money the “Keith way” ;)
Time: How to
balance out study and travel as well as effective ways to properly manage your
time and energy.
Education: What
I have learnt about the different cultures across all the places I have
traveled to as well as differences in education in mainland China and Finland.
Besides money, what kind of assistance do you
need?
The number
one thing you can do to help me is to kindly share it with your friends. While
I am finding a base to settle in the San Francisco region to stay during the
weekdays, I will go traveling during the weekends. I would thus highly
appreciate if anyone could provide me with a couch-surfing place or with a fair
rental fee.
Hey! Are you being paid to advertise Startup
Weekend?
No. Startup
Weekend is a non-profit event. I just want to share my story which is a travel
journey with Startup Weekends.
Why is the delivery day so late?
I am
confident that I can finish the first draft of the book within 3 months after I
come back to Hong Kong from my USA travels. However, since I am not a native
English speaker or writer, I need to send it to my friends for proof-reading
and review. Hence, I scheduled to publish and deliver my first book in March
2016.



Startup Weekend is a 54-hour event where developers, designers, marketers, product managers and startup enthusiasts come together to share ideas, form teams, build products, and launch startups!
On Friday evening, attendees have 1 minute to pitch their new idea, and try to inspire others to join their team. With a team of designer(s), developer(s) and people with a business background, they can begin building their startup. 
During Saturday and Sunday, teams implement the lean startup methodology. They do market research, construct a business model, design prototypes, validate the concept with potential customers, etc. 
On Sunday night, each team presents their business model and demonstrates the minimal viable product to a panel of judges. The winning teams are awarded with amazing prizes and often go on to start real business after the event!
Startup Weekend is a non-profit event, where the local organizing team consists of volunteers. They seek sponsorships to reduce the ticket price, so more dreamers can gather in one place, and make miracles happen in 54 hours. They are truly awesome!
As stated in Startup Weekend’s official webpage, 1,500+ events have already taken place in over 726 cities. Out of these, over 13,000 startups were created and more than 123,000 entrepreneurs participated. Check it out and join the movement at: http://startupweekend.org/
This is where you will probably find Keith in the coming weekends ;)
By joining a Startup Weekend event, you can:
Meet a co-founder or future partners, learn new skills, validate business ideas, build up a network, be guided by experienced mentors, and much more...
Take it from me, you won't regret it after participating in a Startup Weekend.

<h3>About ""A Free Nation in Our Land""</h3>
<p>Israel is one of the greatest historical marvels of our world. The people of Israel returned to their land after 2000 years of exile, dispersed among hundreds of countries, and revived not only their national sovereignty, but also their language and culture. Yet, Israel is also a country faced with the most serious of challenges faced by a nation today.</p>
<p>To face these challenges, Israel requires policies based on a coherent world view. In this book, Illouz seeks to promote a world view based on freedom, national pride, and a love for the land of Israel. This will enable Israel to live up to the lofty goal set in its national anthem: to be ""A Free Nation in Our Land"".</p>

Our goal is for the book to have a real influence on Israel's politics and policies, improving the security and economic situation in Israel by suggesting a coherent worldview through which to deal with these policy issues.
The book has already been written, and it will be published. Through this crowdfunding campaign where you pre-order the book, however, you enables us to properly plan a strategy that will enable this book to have a maximum impact when it is published. 
This makes you a true partner to this lofty goal: Bringing Israel to even greater heights.",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Ensemble, nous allons définir qu’est-ce que cela veut dire exactement, la littérature, à travers leurs histoires, leurs vécus de la lecture. À la fin, je recueillerai ces témoignages dans un livre, une affirmation de la place essentielle de la lecture dans nos vies.Nous allons aborder ces questions au cours d’un repas que je cuisinerai chez les lecteurs. La lecture est à la fois très intime—nous nous couchons un livre dans nos mains, et il devient une partie fondamentale de nous quand nous terminons et le déposons sur notre table de chevet— et partagée, elle définit nos relations aux autres. Je veux entreprendre ce projet dans exactement le même esprit, dans un espace partagé.Quand j’ai commencé d’organiser ce projet, j’ai demandé à toutes les personnes que je connais en France qui pourraient être intéressées d'en faire partie. C’est un voyage que j’ouvre à tous.J’invite toutes les personnes qui voudraient ajouter leur voix au chœur de m’écrire, et de livrer leurs histoires. Je vous écoute.Une des lectrices à qui j’ai écrit pour demander son aide m’a répondu dans une manière que je crois cristallise ce que je veux accomplir : Je te réponds à chaud car je viens de te lire, mais je prendrai le temps de te répondre plus exhaustivement dans la journée de demain. Je suis d'accord pour participer à ton projet et aurais beaucoup de choses à dire à ce sujet.  Vraiment beaucoup. Je trouve ton idée super et j'ai déjà beaucoup de sentiments formulés sur cette question. Car, oui, la littérature et l'art ont changé ma vie. Ou du moins, ont rendu ma vie possible.Je reviens vers toi très vite. Bonne soirée,M--C’est une des histoires que je veux raconter. Il y en a tant d’autres.Je vous demande votre aide dans la réalisation de ce projet.

Je vous invite de partager vos histoires.


Merci.--
À propos de moi :Je suis écrivain et la lecture —la littérature—a changé ma vie. C’est pour cela que je veux explorer comment elle a changé les vies d’autres personnes.

<b>STREET GIRL</b><br/>Rozana McGrattan was a Brazilian street girl, living rough in the 
dangerous slums of São Paulo. She is now a successful business woman 
living in London, and her story Street Girl is full of drama, colour and
 inspiration. In this unique memoir we journey through an extraordinary 
life of homelessness, poverty and violence, with Rozana’s inner hope 
providing the only light in a city of darkness as she fights to escape 
and succeed, against insurmountable odds. Rozana’s tale is an 
inspiration to people all over the world, showing that abuse, 
exploitation and intimidation can be overcome with courage and belief, 
and that love can truly set you free.<br/><i><b>Release date: 9th June 2016<br/><br/></b></i><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460363633/Dragon_Speaker_ow9xlb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Keriya Nameless isn’t exactly hero material, yet the goddess Shivnath

</div></div>","Goals of the Bukowsphere Community


Building a forum of writers and fans of literature, particularly Bukowski's unique writing style. It will be the right place to share as an author, a place where you meet like-minded people and fellow amateur artists.


Building the blog of the Bukowsphere community, where as a member of the community, you will be able to publish your work for the whole world to enjoy.


Giving confidence to amateur writers to show their work to fellow members of the same community, bypassing shyness and other fears that we all feel as novice artists.


Creating the first club subsidiary of the Bukowsphere, right here in Montreal, Canada. We will meet, share our experiences, stories and interests in person. We already started on Meetup : Click here to see our group!



Making a tribute to Charles Bukowski, one of the best writers in History,

Giving amateur writing a crazy new start with Millennials and authors of the 21st century!


The upside for you, as a contributor, is double :



You help to build this community and instantly become a part of it. You will be able to discover quality content (short stories, novels, who knows what else?) created by your fellow members, and will enjoy it forever!


As a writer, you will be able to show your work for the whole world to see! Your short stories or novels will be directly visible for other members and visitors of the blog. This could be the first start of many writers' careers as published authors.



The Indiegogo Campaign

But before we fulfill the dream of sharing the craziest stories we lived and can imagine, we have to make it real! 
Not only this campaign enables the future community to fund itself, but it also builds awareness around it, which in turn attracts many more potential members and authors in the future to create amazing content on it.What will be done with the campaign funds :


Making the official forum of the Bukowsphere : Membership of our community starts here, in the forum. As a contributor for more than 5$, you will get instant membership and the ability to post on the forum and create threads on topics of your choice whenever you like.



Making the official blog of the Bukowsphere : It will be a kickass blog, accessible at bukowsphere.com (domain name already bought). Board members will together agree on a design.


Creating a promotional campaign to attract visitors on the internet and members across the world : Right when the Indiegogo campaign finishes, the funds will also be used to attract potential readers and authors to keep the Bukowsphere growing! [Facebook page of the Bukowsphere]


Designing the first ebook published by the Bukowsphere, which will be a Collection of the most popular posts of the blog and the forum. This selection will be made by the members and the public together. 


Printing the book in a hard-cover book verion, which can take both time and money because of the design and the logistics. Believe me, it will look amazing. 



Founding the first club of artists and fans of the Bukowsphere, the first of its kind, right here in Montreal, and potentially anywhere else in the world.



Bukowski, the project and me

Now that we've covered the details of this project and what will be done with the campaign, let's get into some background. 


Charles Bukowski
This is a writer who dedicated his life to describing the reality of his decadent life, going from town to town, getting fired almost every week, and spending the large majority of his awaken time totally drunk. 

Here's a fan video of one of his interviews : 





Bukowski got worldwide recognition for his honesty and raw sense of realism, which led to the rise of a new genre called ""Dirty Realism"", of which he is the pioneer.

Although many people hate his style because of the paradox created by vulgarity and literature put together, he is definitely recognized as one of the greatest modern authors. Bukowski was born in 1920 and died in 1994. 


The name of our community is an homage to this master writer.



About me and how the project started

My name is Tom. I'm a 26 year old engineer living in Montreal, Canada. 

Here's the main reason why I want to create this community :


The first time I read a book by Charles Bukowski, I was hooked! His brutal honesty and unapologetic way of describing his feelings and his life made me want to write my own book of short stories.
I love to write those stories on my laptop for hours, sitting at home or in a Starbucks. I might be the main protagonist, but my stories still make me laugh my *ss off! I always share my short stories with my friends and they have always encouraged me to publish them.
Then a few weeks ago, I thought ""what if everyone could share their funny stories in an artistic way, like I like to do?""
That's how I decided to create this community and this campaign.

A little bit more about me?
I sometimes get to wear suits, which makes me look quite handsome! Sometimes, I let my beard grow and wear a leather jacket to look like a Badass :

<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>Hi friends! As you know, I have been working on a book that outlines my career journey to find my purpose. You know me as a passionate individual on the topic of personal and professional improvement and on career success. The book documents my career success approach and I have curated the best SIWIKE (Stuff I Wish I Knew Earlier) to help those who are stuck or want to accelerate their career success. Stuff you didn't know you needed to know (the acronym SYDKYNTK that didn't sound as great...).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHO THE BOOK IS FOR</h3>
<p>Do you feel that you could be doing more with your life? Getting more out of your career? Or do you feel stuck? Or do you have a direction but just don't know how to get there? The book targeted for anyone who feels they could be doing more with their career.  The primary focus is for ""soon-to-be-grads"" though feedback has indicated that the insights in the book would help many who want to get more out of their career. The book is for you if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In university / college getting ready for the working world</li>
<li>In high school preparing to find your career path</li>
<li>A recent grad still looking for a job / career</li>
<li>A not-so-recent grad stuck in your career </li>
<li>Even an experienced professional looking to transition in your career </li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, this book is not for everyone. If you are at the top of your game, someone who is top of your class, who is the president of multiple clubs, volunteers at homeless shelters and already has a job that they want lined up for them after graduation, this book <strong>MIGHT </strong>be for you as there's always more to learn! But, if you are doing ""just okay"", and are uncertain about your future career, not sure if you are doing the right thing, and feel you could be doing more with your career, this book <strong>IS DEFINITELY </strong>for you.</p>
<p>If the book does not help you, email me at luki@focusinspired.com and I'll do my best to make it right. I want to change the world, one person at a time. </p>
<p>Get a book for you, a friend, a child, a niece/nephew, cousin, mentee or anyone else you know that would benefit from career guidance. </p>
<p>The book is expected in Oct 2017 with an early Nov 2017 book launch!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p>For those that don't know me, my name is Luki Danukarjanto, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukidanu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukidanu</a>, a former management consultant, campus recruiter and people advocate who has found a <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>mission to help those looking to get more out of their careers to catalyze and accelerate their career potential. I have found my purpose to help others find their purpose. Cheesy, but true.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>MISSION</strong></h3>
<p>The mission is: to weave mentorship into the fabric of society. Starting by making Toronto the Mentorship capital of the world. I do so by sharing SIWIKE (""Stuff I Wish I Knew Earlier"") which has been useful for helping me find my career passion. I have a firm belief that if everyone actively sought out mentors and (just as importantly), everyone mentored and shared their own SIWIKE, then much of the problems with the world would resolve themselves. Think about that for a moment.</p>
<p>The book curates the best SIWIKE I have found for soon-to-be-grads to catalyze and accelerate their career success.</p>
<p>The book will be step 1 to get the message of SIWIKE and mentorship to the masses. The roadmap will continue with more content distribution in the form of an interactive app (helping you implement the tactics in the book), blogs, videos, podcasts, a school for soft-skills and whatever makes sense. I aim to transform education and focus on fundamentals. Topics like self-awareness, emotional intelligence, effective communication, self-care and other topics that don't have a course code. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How will the proceeds be used?</h3>
<p>The proceeds will be used to cover the publication costs of the book. Publishing can be expensive. Especially for someone who is not a seasoned author. If I went with a standard publisher then the book might have been done a year from now so I've gone with a hybrid publisher putting my own money on the line. I have already spent a bunch of money on editing and other services so the proceeds would help cover costs. I am passionate about getting the message out and I hope you can support me in the cause! </p>
<p>Some perks contribute to supporting the book launch. And all perks, include some funds to support development of new programs and services to help enable career success for others!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>

</div></div>","OVERVIEW
Hi friends! As you know, I have been working on a book that outlines my career journey to find my purpose. You know me as a passionate individual on the topic of personal and professional improvement and on career success. The book documents my career success approach and I have curated the best SIWIKE (Stuff I Wish I Knew Earlier) to help those who are stuck or want to accelerate their career success. Stuff you didn't know you needed to know (the acronym SYDKYNTK that didn't sound as great...).
 
WHO THE BOOK IS FOR
Do you feel that you could be doing more with your life? Getting more out of your career? Or do you feel stuck? Or do you have a direction but just don't know how to get there? The book targeted for anyone who feels they could be doing more with their career.  The primary focus is for ""soon-to-be-grads"" though feedback has indicated that the insights in the book would help many who want to get more out of their career. The book is for you if you are:

In university / college getting ready for the working world
In high school preparing to find your career path
A recent grad still looking for a job / career
A not-so-recent grad stuck in your career 
Even an experienced professional looking to transition in your career 

Yet, this book is not for everyone. If you are at the top of your game, someone who is top of your class, who is the president of multiple clubs, volunteers at homeless shelters and already has a job that they want lined up for them after graduation, this book MIGHT be for you as there's always more to learn! But, if you are doing ""just okay"", and are uncertain about your future career, not sure if you are doing the right thing, and feel you could be doing more with your career, this book IS DEFINITELY for you.
If the book does not help you, email me at luki@focusinspired.com and I'll do my best to make it right. I want to change the world, one person at a time. 
Get a book for you, a friend, a child, a niece/nephew, cousin, mentee or anyone else you know that would benefit from career guidance. 
The book is expected in Oct 2017 with an early Nov 2017 book launch!
 
ABOUT ME
For those that don't know me, my name is Luki Danukarjanto, https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukidanu, a former management consultant, campus recruiter and people advocate who has found a mission to help those looking to get more out of their careers to catalyze and accelerate their career potential. I have found my purpose to help others find their purpose. Cheesy, but true.
 
MISSION
The mission is: to weave mentorship into the fabric of society. Starting by making Toronto the Mentorship capital of the world. I do so by sharing SIWIKE (""Stuff I Wish I Knew Earlier"") which has been useful for helping me find my career passion. I have a firm belief that if everyone actively sought out mentors and (just as importantly), everyone mentored and shared their own SIWIKE, then much of the problems with the world would resolve themselves. Think about that for a moment.
The book curates the best SIWIKE I have found for soon-to-be-grads to catalyze and accelerate their career success.
The book will be step 1 to get the message of SIWIKE and mentorship to the masses. The roadmap will continue with more content distribution in the form of an interactive app (helping you implement the tactics in the book), blogs, videos, podcasts, a school for soft-skills and whatever makes sense. I aim to transform education and focus on fundamentals. Topics like self-awareness, emotional intelligence, effective communication, self-care and other topics that don't have a course code. 
 
How will the proceeds be used?
The proceeds will be used to cover the publication costs of the book. Publishing can be expensive. Especially for someone who is not a seasoned author. If I went with a standard publisher then the book might have been done a year from now so I've gone with a hybrid publisher putting my own money on the line. I have already spent a bunch of money on editing and other services so the proceeds would help cover costs. I am passionate about getting the message out and I hope you can support me in the cause! 
Some perks contribute to supporting the book launch. And all perks, include some funds to support development of new programs and services to help enable career success for others!
 
Perks
Perks range from a copy of the book, to coaching, to various forms of commemoration. I'd appreciate any help you can. 
NOTE: any students registering for coaching perks with their school email addresses will get a student bonus of double the support duration (i.e. 4 month coaching --> 8 month coaching), which becomes a 50% discount!

None of the perks work for you? (How else you can help)
Feel free to contribute what you can, especially if I've added any value to you in the career guidance I have given you (aka. coffee chats or lunch where I didn't charge you my normal hourly rate - yes, I am layering on a bit of guilt :) 
If you can't contribute monetarily, please share the link with friends that would benefit from career guidance or would be interested in supporting the mission to make Toronto the mentorship capital of the world! Also, feel free to Like and Comment on posts and other content that will support the mission!

<p><b>Who is Laura Powers?</b></p>
<p>Laura lives in the
City of Angels (Los Angeles) and is a medium, clairvoyant, and angel
communicator who saw and sensed ghosts and spirits since she was little. 
In her journey to learn how to understand what was happening, to protect
herself, and work with spirits safely (the topic of her first book <i>Life
and the After-Life</i>), she started working with angels (the topic of her
second book, <i>Angels:  How to Understand, Recognize and Receive
Their Guidance</i>).  Once she mastered the ability to work safely with
the spirit realm, she started her working clear spaces that were haunted (the
topic of her 3<sup>rd</sup> book Diary of a Ghost Whisperer).  Now she wants to share what she’s learned
about manifesting with others.  She is
currently shooting several television shows and has others in post-production. Laura
spends her time writing, teaching, doing readings, entertaining others, and
also having an amazing time!  </p>

The Impact
This will help me get
this book out faster and with specific funds for marketing.  My other
three books Life and the After-Life: Notes from a Medium and Angel
Communicator and Angels: How to Understand, Recognize,
and Receive Their Guidance, and
Diary of a Ghost Whisperer have been successfully self-
published and are selling well on amazon.  This book will help people
understand their own ability to shift and change their life with the help of
angels!  Most of us are playing a game
but we don’t know the rules of the game, so we are losing!  This book will help you understand how to win
in life!
You can find my other
books on amazon here.
Other Ways You Can
Help
Help me get the word
out, share on facebook etc!  Ask the angels to help me (really it works!).
Thanks in advance to
everyone for their support!",0.0,0,"8 Campaigns

</h3>
<p>Hello friends! Nikki Lyn Pugh
here. I am a writer and I use to be an elementary school teacher.  However you arrived here, I am so glad you made it! This campaign is about bringing into
being a very special story with a very special cast of characters. These
characters are young and wise and they live in a very unique time here on Earth. </p>
<p>These characters have A LOT to
say. And NOW is the time for them to tell their story. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>MY GOAL</b></p>
<p><b>My goal is to finish Book One of the TRAVELER ADVENTURE SERIES by
the end of October 2015.</b> With your help and a little uninterrupted writing
time, I believe I can accomplish this goal. I started the Traveler Series over
ten years ago and have about 75 pages written so far. <b>I am
asking for the equivalent of $2,000 a month for 3 months.</b> That will be
enough to keep me in pb and j’s (and keep all my creditors happy) while I write,
write, write. Further down this text, you can check out what exactly my
expenses will be for that time period. They are not much, but having the means to pay them  while I write would sure be a load off my mind and keep my writing pen
light, not heavy with worry (and keep my stomach from grumbling too!) </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHY FINISHING THIS BOOK
IS IMPORTANT TO ME</b></p>
<p>For me, THE TRAVELER SERIES is
the BIG ONE. The WHOLE ENCHILADA, so to speak. In a way, I feel like these
characters approached me over ten years ago and if I don’t publish their story,
I would not only not be fulfilling my service here on earth, I would
also be letting a whole group of pretty cool characters down to boot (see video
above for more information about how I first met Cherrie and Desert Woman, the
main characters in Book One of the Traveler Series). </p>
<p>To put it another way: Have you
ever had a project that you just had to get off your plate before you leave
this planet or you are sure you will reincarnate the next time around as a
cockroach?  For me, it’s as if God will
say once I get to the pearly gates, “You know, you did a lot of good in your
life, but you didn’t do THAT ONE THING that you came down here to do so…back
you go.” Wings, hard shell and all. </p>
<p>Not that there won’t be other
enchiladas to fry later on. For sure there will be. Other books- 10 more in
this series alone, to be exact. Also other projects, other passions. I just know,
however, that if I don’t cook up this
one first, that is, IF I DON’T FINISH THIS FIRST BOOK IN THE TRAVELER ADVENTURE
SERIES AND SOON, all the other writing projects will be more or less stale
tortillas. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE TRAVELER ADVENTURE
SERIES ANYWAYS?</b> </p>
<p>The Traveler Series will
eventually consist of 11 books aimed at the young adult sci-fi fantasy market. It
will be fun and filled with lots adventure, time travel, 5<sup>th</sup>
dimensional visitations from quirky and imperfect beings from far, far away, downhome
conversations with some pretty cool cats throughout history (including Einstein
and Bob Dylan), childhood antics, and a whole LOT of wisdom. There will be
teenage love and shape shifting and talking dolphins wearing Bermuda shorts.
All this fun, and, in addition, it is my intention that TRAVELER and her
cohorts, through their words, their actions, and most-of-all their Hero’s Journey
(a la Joseph Campbell) will throw down some serious truth bombs that have to do
with our collective past and also plans for our collective future here on
Planet Earth.</p>
<p><b>It is my hope that The Traveler Adventure Series will give kids HOPE
and it will offer another way of being and seeing that may open the door to
their true potential.</b></p>
<p>After all, if anyone is going to save
this wonderful planet that we have made an absolute mess of, it is going to be
the next generation, right? </p>
<p>I have LOTS of eventual plans for The Traveler Series. A
movie? A graphic novel? An interactive website and/or game? A course on
consciousness for young adults and teens and everyone in between? Of course,
all of these are possibilities. No matter what dimension you dwell in, however,
<b>IT ALL STARTS WITH THAT ONE STEP NOW.</b>
 And that step for me is to have the TIME (ironically) to write free of bill worries
and free of obligations except for what goes on the page: three blissful and
bust-ass months to get this darn thing down. </p>
<p>Traveler and her friends have been waiting for over 10 years,
for crying out loud. </p>
<p>Says Traveler: “In the 5<sup>th</sup> dimension, ten years
is actually a blink of an eye. But for a character-in-waiting, it is like an
eternity!” </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>CHECK OUT THOSE COOL PERKS! </b></p>
<p>Boy, do I have some awesome perks for you for contributing
different amounts to this campaign. Here is a little more detail about them: </p>
<p><b>$2 CONTRIBUTION:</b>  a BIG THANK YOU on my Nikki Lyn Pugh Facebook
Page and on the GentleTraveler.com blog… coming soon (by August 2015) to a
computer screen near you. Did I mention that the thank you is BIG? We are
talking BOLDFACE, ELEPHANT FONT, COLORED TEXT…the whole bit. </p>
<p><b>$10 CONTRIBUTION:</b>
All the BIG THANK YOU’s MENTIONED ABOVE and a personalized THANK YOU POSTCARD
from Traveler, coming right at you from the 5<sup>th</sup> Dimension. Have you
ever gotten a postcard from the 5<sup>th</sup> Dimension? I mean, how cool is
that! </p>
<p><b>$25 CONTRIBUTION:</b>
All the THANK YOUs (social media and hand
written in official 5D ink) mentioned above PLUS a copy of the book when it is
published (estimated release date: Spring 2016)</p>
<p><b>$50 CONTRIBUTION:</b>
All the above (yes, the book too!) PLUS, for this amount, I have partnered with
super-talented documentary film maker Jody McNicholas to give away a copy of
one of her latest creations. Fifty dollar contributors have the choice of
either 1.) Eco Chic Retreat, a do-it-yourself, at home retreat video, which features
instruction from nationwide professionals in the fields of yoga, dance,
painting, qi gong and more or 2.) a premier copy of her very latest work,
Longshotsville (estimated release date: Summer 2016). Note: there
are only 4 Eco Chic Retreat copies available so for that one, it is first-come,
first-serve (and will be deliverable in August/September 2015). </p>
<p><b>$100 CONTRIBTION:</b>
Did I mention that in my other life
(when I am not writing off-the-wall and consciousness-raising young adult
novels) I help people write books and market their passions, products and
services through the written word? For a $100 contribution, you get a 2-hour
session of editing, book creation coaching or marketing consulting/writing from
me. This includes a half hour free initial consultation…so that is 2.5 hours
total, folks. I normally charge up to $100 an hour for these services, so that
is a 2 for 1 deal! Oh yeah, you also get a copy of the book and all the THANK
YOUs you can handle. For more information about my marketing copywriting,
editing and book creation coaching services, please visit <a href=""http://www.asyourword.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.asyourword.com</u></a>. Note: half hour free
consultation can be redeemed any time after August 2015. The two hours of editing,
book consulting or actual marketing copywriting can be redeemed anytime after
October, 2015. </p>
<p><b>$250 CONTRIBUTION:</b>
This is where the fun really begins. For a $250 contribution, you get WEEKLY
POSTCARDS from Traveler and friends from wherever they happen to be at the time
(this is a book about time travel, so the possibilities are endless), PLUS a
copy of the book (estimated release date of Spring 2016) PLUS your name in
print in the acknowledgement page of the book … plus a BIG TRAVELING BAG OF
THANK YOUs wherever I can post ‘em! </p>
<p><b>$1000 CONTRIBUTION:</b>
FIFTEEN FULL HOURS of marketing copywriting, book editing, book creation coaching
or project/life purpose coaching (plus half hour free initial consultation), WEEKLY
postcards from the road sent to you directly from Traveler and friends, a copy
of the book (release date Spring 2016), a BIG acknowledgement in the book
itself and a bushel of THANK YOUs from everyone involved (me and all my not-so-imaginary
friends LOL)! Note: I am a trained marketing copywriter and life purpose/project
coach so FIFTEEN HOURS of services is pure gold for anyone about ready to
launch a product or  get started on a book, creating a website, write an eBook
(yes I can do that too), who has an idea for a book or product/service or is simply
going through a life transition and would like some gentle guidance along the
way. With that amount of time, for example, I can write a 20 page eBook, I can
create a simple, template-based website for you, I can edit about 20-40 pages
of your book, I can walk you gently through any doubts you may have about whatever
you are wanting to launch or do next (yes, you can do it, whatever it is) or I
can help you with a little bit of all of the above. Half hour free consultation
can be redeemed any time after August 2015. Fifteen hours of editing, book
consulting or actual marketing copywriting can be redeemed anytime after
January, 2016 (unless special arrangements are made ahead of time…if you are
prepping for an early 2016 launch or need some help with what to do next NOW,
let’s talk!). For more information about my marketing copywriting, editing and
book creation coaching services, please visit <a href=""http://www.asyourword.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.asyourword.com</u></a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>NOW FOR SOME FINE PRINT….</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>BUT WHAT IF YOU DON’T
MAKE YOUR GOAL, OH TIRELESS WRITER? </b></p>
<p>At the very bottom of this text section, you can take a look
at the exact financial obligations I will have over the next three months. In
general, however, all of the funds that you contribute to this campaign will go
towards my personal living expenses and bills during the months of August,
September and October, the three months that I would like to be writing and finishing
this book. That’s $2,000 a month for three months = $6,000. If by chance my goal
is not met, then I will use whatever generous contributions are given to write
for whatever amount of time the total contribution amount will afford me to
write. For example, if I raise only $2,000, well, hey that is one full month of
writing…yay! A lot of character development can be done in 30 days time! In
addition, if you contribute a certain amount that is connected to a perk and I don’t
reach my goal, you still get the perk. How about that? If it is a
time-sensitive Perk, like three months of postcards from Traveler herself, then
you still get those postcards for the amount of time I can write uninterrupted (for
example, if I raise $4,000, then that is two month’s worth of postcards to
you!). And, of course, for those generous souls who contribute the BIG BUCKS
that come with valuable editing, marketing copywriting and coaching services with
me, you bet you get those too even if I don’t make my goal. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>AND WHAT HAPPENS IF
YOU GO OVER YOUR GOAL?</b></p>
<p>Enough about the lower end of the spectrum, now for the fun
part! What if the stars align and you are feeling especially touched by this
presentation and …wow! I exceed my goal of $6,000? Then one of two things will
happen: I will use the extra money for extra time to write if I am not finished
within the six months or 2.) I will use the funds for publishing, either
self-publishing or sending out the river of proposals to various publishing
houses in order to publish it that way. I do marketing and editing for a
living, so I’m pretty up on how that whole world works, but, to be honest, I’m
not quite sure which way my characters want to go yet on that one. Self-pub or
publishing house? For a writer, it’s the age-old question. I am sure I will be “told”
which way is best when the time is right! (in other words, I will trust my
Intuition, which is only right about 100% of the time). By the way, since we
are talking percentages, did you know that 5% of all profits from the sale of
these books will go to organizations that help educate kids about respecting
and living in harmony with earth? That means that any extra contributions for
this campaign that go to publishing will also be going to those orgs. It’s a win-win
for everyone involved! </p>
<p><b>GEE, I WOULD LOVE TO
HELP WITH SOME CASH BUT…</b></p>
<p>Hey, been there, done that. I totally get it. A steady diet
of top ramen? Did it. Putting $5.89 in the gas tank? Yep, I have the receipt to
prove it. If you can’t contribute to this campaign in cold, hard cash right
now, THAT’S OKAY! Simply share this campaign with as many of your friends and
neighbors in cyberspace and elsewhere as you can.  You can use the IndieGogo share features directly
on this page or you can simply pass on my campaign link to others in some other
way. But be sure to share the link before the campaign ends on August 1, 2015! </p>

<p><b>NIKKI LYN PUGH’S</b> <b>MONTHLY BUDGET </b></p>
<p><b>(August, September and
October, 2015) </b></p>
<p>Here is what $2,000 a month looks like in my world and what
you would be helping to fund specifically so I can write, write, write:</p>
<p><b>Food: $300 </b></p>
<p>(I have some health
issues so I have to eat organic all the way)</p>
<p><b>Vitamins: $100 </b></p>
<p>(in leui of meds, I
take some specific supplements that help keep my condition at bay. I was
diagnosed with an autoimmune condition a while ago) </p>
<p><b>Gas/RV Hook Ups: $400</b></p>
<p>(in leui of rent, since
we live in an RV, we spend our dough on gas and RV services)</p>
<p><b>Dental Payback: $600 </b></p>
<p>(I pay my family back
for helping me out with some dental issues last year. Bless their hearts!) </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Stephanie Kneese, I'm a stay at home mom and I have a dream of becoming a published author. I grew up with a wild imagination. I've always loved telling stories and writing.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise money to have my first novel, ""Keeper of Secrets"" published. This is the first in a series, <i>The Five Maidens Trilogy</i>. It's the story of a young girl who finds out she's from another world. A short synopsis is below. Because this is a trilogy I would like you to know I've already begun writing the second and parts of the third. My goal is to have the rest of the trilogy published in 2016.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I've asked for this amount for the following:</p> <ul> <li>Cover Design</li>
<li>Editing and Formatting</li> <li>Printing and Shipping Paperbacks</li> <li>Marketing Material</li>
<li>Website Design, Promotions, etc.</li>
<li>Indiegogo and Paypal Fees</li> </ul>
<div>If I exceed my goal this will just put me a step ahead for the other two novels in the series (editing, cover design, printing, etc.).</div>
<div>My perks for my sponsors will be mailed out after my novel has been published (aiming for October 2015).</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Short Synopsis</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Avalon Smith wants nothing more than to live a normal teenage life. That’s exactly what she had until she lost her parents and moved across country to live with her aunt.</p>
<p>A secret club at her new school has expressed interest in her, telling her she belongs to another world. They’ve forced their way into her life before she even knew they existed.</p>
<p>After disappearances and deaths start happening around town she learns of a prophecy. A prophecy that says five maidens are to come together and defeat a great evil. Is she one of the maidens? Can she trust her new friends?</p>
<br/>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest challenge is going to be raising the funds for this process. My goal is to have the novel in my hands by October 2015. </p>
<p>Another challenge is going to be getting my novel out there. I will be advertising through facebook, twitter, friends, my website (once complete), and hopefully a few launch parties.</p>

Wonderfully illustrated by renowned Canadian artist, Miles Lowry (who also contributed poetry and the overall book design), this work has long been used as both text and guide for individual or collective process, and arts workshops. It is featured as required reading for classes on alternative philosophies of art, shamanistic studies, and accessing creativity. Contributors of over $75 will receive both this book and a copy of my work of magical fiction, 'The Cup of Mari-Anu.' This is a parable and shamanic 'wonder tale' that tells the story of an epic, heroic journey, reclaiming the Divine Feminine, and coming of age in a time of drought. Set in the Ancient Near East, it is beautifully illustrated by Bay Area artist, Kevan Lane Miller. Major contributors, of $400 or more, will receive the above plus a copy of the proposed book when published.</p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">If you are concerned about the spread of misogyny, gender inequality, and other kinds of bigotry and intolerance (often perpetrated under the aegis of 'Freedom of Religious Expression' or 'Freedom of Speech'), then you will want to support this work and contribute to its 'going viral.' The book and its theoretical approach deconstruct the accepted ideologies of femininity (and, indeed, of humanity) that have limited women's (and, thereby, their children's and partners') choices for so long. It does this through examining historic representations of women and ideological 'Others' as 'polluted' and inferior, in art, science, literature, and theology, among other discourses. I have written and published many, smaller works on these themes, with journal articles, allegorical fiction pieces, works of theoretical non-fiction and cultural studies under my belt.

Wonderfully illustrated by renowned Canadian artist, Miles Lowry (who also contributed poetry and the overall book design), this work has long been used as both text and guide for individual or collective process, and arts workshops. It is featured as required reading for classes on alternative philosophies of art, shamanistic studies, and accessing creativity. Contributors of over $75 will receive both this book and a copy of my work of magical fiction, 'The Cup of Mari-Anu.' This is a parable and shamanic 'wonder tale' that tells the story of an epic, heroic journey, reclaiming the Divine Feminine, and coming of age in a time of drought. Set in the Ancient Near East, it is beautifully illustrated by Bay Area artist, Kevan Lane Miller. Major contributors, of $400 or more, will receive the above plus a copy of the proposed book when published.
If you are concerned about the spread of misogyny, gender inequality, and other kinds of bigotry and intolerance (often perpetrated under the aegis of 'Freedom of Religious Expression' or 'Freedom of Speech'), then you will want to support this work and contribute to its 'going viral.' The book and its theoretical approach deconstruct the accepted ideologies of femininity (and, indeed, of humanity) that have limited women's (and, thereby, their children's and partners') choices for so long. It does this through examining historic representations of women and ideological 'Others' as 'polluted' and inferior, in art, science, literature, and theology, among other discourses. I have written and published many, smaller works on these themes, with journal articles, allegorical fiction pieces, works of theoretical non-fiction and cultural studies under my belt. Some of my published work on arts, culture, art history and alternative philosophies can be viewed here: https://ucl.academia.edu/YvonneOwens
The topics I've written and published on include: Feminism, Dystopian

following terms: ""In terms of strategy, we propose to release it first as
an academic hardback book. Once this edition has sold out, mainly to university
libraries and other institutions, the book would have a second paperback
edition for a more general audience. Presenting the book first in a strictly
academic format is important, because your research makes an important and
novel contribution to the study of cultural history.
In other words, when first released, the packaging should convey the
appropriate degree of scholarly significance and weight.""  
The only hurdle I face in bringing this project to fruition is the unpaid time it will take me to mount a major work of scholarly research and composition, especially one of this scope and scale. Financial assistance will enable me to focus on what should be an immensely pleasurable task, providing survival anxiety is removed from the mix. YOU, your interest, and your generosity of spirit are my plan for overcoming these challenges. Even if financial assistance is not possible for you at this time, you can still assist me greatly in getting the word out, publicizing and promoting my campaign. Sharing this on your FaceBook page will do wonders!  And you can also always use the Indiegogo share tools on this site.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Are We Offering Our Backers?</h3>
<p>Like with any other disrupting technology introduced in the market, the first users will have a huge advantage over the late arrivals. If you help us get started, we will do what we can to help you make the best of that advantage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We made a short video explaining the perk's. Please check it out to get the full understanding of how our perk's work.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Ff8pM7G3hAJo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Df8pM7G3hAJo%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Ff8pM7G3hAJo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Zhontor's revenue will come from ebook sales. This creates a nice incentive for everyone to succeed in creating quality literature that the readers will enjoy.</p>
<p>We are planning to keep Zhontor's share of the revenue capped at 20%, leaving 80% for the author to keep or invest in translations or editing. All of our perk's are focused around reducing Zhontor's share to 10%, and adding that to your share.</p>
<p>If you are planning to go for one of the reader's perk's, it will be a discount on your price. </p>
<p>If you are a contributor, the perk's will give you increased income on your sales. But keep in mind that the effect you create through the perk's, is dependent on your own success.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition, we will offer to brand your account with a special ""Co-Founder"" tag, that will show everyone that you were one of the initial backers. It will give your work an edge, documenting that you played a key role in creating something that benefited a great many people.</p>

</h3>
<p>These are the famous words that refer to
the thoughts of Allen Lane in 1935, when he was inspired to create Penguin
Books and introduce the world to the quality paperback. </p>
<p>Allen Lane was a man that did not judge a
book by its cover. He believed that there was a vast public who appreciated the
quality of the literature regardless of the format that presented it. Allen
Lane changed the world of literature with his vision.</p>
<p>Today, we face a similar challenge. </p>
<p>But what is preventing the literature from
reaching the masses today – 80 years later?</p>

Language Problem</b></h4>
<p>Most everyone prefers to read and write in
their native language. </p>
<p>Let’s assume that you have published your book in English –
the most widely understood language in the world. Then take a look at these statistics:</p>
<p>The world population when this is written is
7 369 210 000. The population that has English as their
native language is approximately 360 million.</p>

<ul>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So if you have

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The answer is ""breadcrumbs"". On average, an author that publishes through traditional channels, is left with around 5% of the revenue from book-sales on their domestic market.

<p>Even
though many of the grown population still prefer the feel of holding a physical book in their hands, the emerging generation will not make that distinction. They will
continue to appreciate and enjoy quality literature, as generations have before
them. But they will do most of their reading on the go – on their tablet, smartphone,
or any of the future devices that we haven’t invented yet. </p>
<p>Today, and especially in the near future, literature needs to be digitalized to be read.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And
the world is connecting at a rapid pace. Around 2.8 billion were connected in
2014, and already 3.2 billion are connected today. And we expect this amount to be doubled within the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Currently, the e-book market share of the
total book sales worldwide is 12.3%. The e-book market share in Europe is 4.5%.
</p>
<p>Why is the European e-book market share so
low? </p>
<p>Might it be that Europe is represented with 225 different

<p>Europe has a combined population of 750 million people. And they do read - a lot! <br/></p>

<br/>
<br/>
</div>
<div>The long term ambition of developing self-service tools for creating Audio-books have been budgeted to an isolated development cost of approximately $250 000. The reason why we have kept this as a high hanging stretch goal, is the recognition of the need to consolidate core functionality for supporting traditional literature, before addressing a long term ambition. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Between the lines in this crude funding plan, there are lots of details, including ISBN support, cross-border transaction solutions, reporting systems, PoD support for physical distribution options, etc.</span><br/>

<div>The expected administration and IT costs of day-to-day operations for core functionality are considerable, and we will need a healthy business running as a foundation in order to pursue this long term ambition.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>What if we fail to reach our goal?</h4>
<div>If we fail to reach our goal, we will need to consider our course of action from what we have achieved. If we reach 50% or more, we will at least explore the possibility for additional external funding for the remaining half. Another option will be to scale down our ambitions, and get a simpler and cheaper solution running. </div>
<div>External ownership is something we would prefer to avoid. Zhontors mission is to make reading and writing available to everyone, in sync with the expansion of connectivity to the internet. And while doing so, respecting the local traditions and culture, in which native languages play a key role. </div>
<div>This is most definitely a ""low-profit &amp; high-development"" based ambition. And that is something which professional investors looking to make a profit tend to object to.<br/>

Authors are struggling to reach their
audience, because:



There
are over 100 different major languages around the world, and readers
prefer to read in their own native language.


Only
about 5% of the world population has English as their native language.


The
costs of translating literature to new languages are currently prohibitive.

The
expected revenue for the average author is too low to make a living.
Most authors are alone with their writing process.


Zhontor are taking the first steps towards redesigning the writing process, by:




Providing
a free, lightweight writing tool that allows the authors to reach their audience
faster and with greater precision than ever before.


Providing
a networking community where authors from different countries can improve and translate each other’s work to their own native languages, or even allow readers
with strong linguistic skills to do so.


Providing
a community that channels the revenue from book sales back to the resources
that actually create the literature.






Zhontor’s mission is to eradicate language barriers and make reading and writing easier and more accessible to everyone.


What Exactly Are We Building?

How does it work?
The interface will be completely free to use, so that nothing prevents your literature from inspiring readers across the world.






You can write your literature directly using the writer's tool, or upload
what you have already written and go from there.



You can invite co-writers, editors or translators to get started on their tasks. You can also pre-publish sections of your material, which is useful for releasing teasers and to get the community interested in translating the book at an early stage of your writing process.



Translations and editing
If you enjoy a good book, and find that is has not been translated to your native language yet, you can offer to do so for a share of the book sales in your domestic market.  
A rating system will show the author that your work is of high quality, and the author can choose to grant you access for translating to your native language. 
When your offer is accepted, you will be a part of the Author's team, and the two of you will be able to communicate and work efficiently on the book together within the platform.



The community will play a key role in providing feedback on the many contributors, so that you can check out their merits before accepting their help.


The impact!

With a complete tool that addresses all aspects of creating and improving traditional literature, authors are free to focus on their creative writing. Then by sharing the revenue from the literature they create, they can spread their literature to every corner of the world.


And readers can enjoy their books - in their native language, on the device of their choice.





The readers are the driving force for the creation of literature, and Zhontor connects the reader with the author in a way that has never been done before. 


What Are We Offering Our Backers?
Like with any other disrupting technology introduced in the market, the first users will have a huge advantage over the late arrivals. If you help us get started, we will do what we can to help you make the best of that advantage.

We made a short video explaining the perk's. Please check it out to get the full understanding of how our perk's work.

Zhontor's revenue will come from ebook sales. This creates a nice incentive for everyone to succeed in creating quality literature that the readers will enjoy.
We are planning to keep Zhontor's share of the revenue capped at 20%, leaving 80% for the author to keep or invest in translations or editing. All of our perk's are focused around reducing Zhontor's share to 10%, and adding that to your share.
If you are planning to go for one of the reader's perk's, it will be a discount on your price. 
If you are a contributor, the perk's will give you increased income on your sales. But keep in mind that the effect you create through the perk's, is dependent on your own success.

In addition, we will offer to brand your account with a special ""Co-Founder"" tag, that will show everyone that you were one of the initial backers. It will give your work an edge, documenting that you played a key role in creating something that benefited a great many people.

Why do we need this?


“He just wanted a decent book to read…”

These are the famous words that refer to
the thoughts of Allen Lane in 1935, when he was inspired to create Penguin
Books and introduce the world to the quality paperback. 
Allen Lane was a man that did not judge a
book by its cover. He believed that there was a vast public who appreciated the
quality of the literature regardless of the format that presented it. Allen
Lane changed the world of literature with his vision.
Today, we face a similar challenge. 
But what is preventing the literature from
reaching the masses today – 80 years later?

The
Language Problem
Most everyone prefers to read and write in
their native language. 
Let’s assume that you have published your book in English –
the most widely understood language in the world. Then take a look at these statistics:
The world population when this is written is
7 369 210 000. The population that has English as their
native language is approximately 360 million.



So if you have
published your book in English, you have effectively reached 5% of the global
market. What about the remaining 95%?


And if you have published your book in
German, you have effectively reached 1.2%. What about the remaining 98.8%?


This list goes on and on with hundreds of major languages around the world.



Bestselling authors
make arrangements with 3rd parties to have their literature translated and distributed to bookstores around the
world. But at what cost? What is left for the writer, after all the involved
parties have had their share? And what about those that sell in fair volumes, but
not at a bestselling level?
The answer is ""breadcrumbs"". On average, an author that publishes through traditional channels, is left with around 5% of the revenue from book-sales on their domestic market. Their earnings from the literature translated and distributed abroad is closer to zero.

One should expect electronic distribution
to remedy this, but it is still next to impossible to buy a random ebook translated
from the language it was originally written in.
Which brings us to.....

The
Distribution Problem
Even
though many of the grown population still prefer the feel of holding a physical book in their hands, the emerging generation will not make that distinction. They will
continue to appreciate and enjoy quality literature, as generations have before
them. But they will do most of their reading on the go – on their tablet, smartphone,
or any of the future devices that we haven’t invented yet. 
Today, and especially in the near future, literature needs to be digitalized to be read.



And
the world is connecting at a rapid pace. Around 2.8 billion were connected in
2014, and already 3.2 billion are connected today. And we expect this amount to be doubled within the next 10 years.
Currently, the e-book market share of the
total book sales worldwide is 12.3%. The e-book market share in Europe is 4.5%.

Why is the European e-book market share so
low? 
Might it be that Europe is represented with 225 different
languages across more than 50 countries? 
Europe has a combined population of 750 million people. And they do read - a lot! 
But since most people prefer to read books in their
native language, they are restricted to buying ebooks written by their domestic
authors. In order to read books from foreign writers, they need to go to
the bookstore and buy a paperback copy translated to their own language.
The result: Europeans play a lot of
candy-crush.


This story repeats itself across 50 European countries, and close to 200 countries across the world. 
The industry is currently not succeeding in distributing literature to the masses at a sufficient level.

What
do we do about it?
Currently, there are no practical ways to
remedy this situation. So we need to get started on building a system that uses the human resource to its full extent. It’s not very
complicated, but we need a little nudge in the right direction, and let
modern technology work for us.
With Zhontor, we are taking the first few
baby steps. And this is where the pooling of our resources enters the picture.



Let’s
put the writers back in the driver’s seat!


Let’s
create a lightweight, yet powerful writing tool that allows the writers to reach
their audience faster!


Let’s
provide a networking community that allow Authors from different countries to translate
each other’s books to their native languages!


Let’s
allow the readers help with improving the literature and translate it to their
native language!


Let’s
do this in a way that everyone involved can earn a living by doing so!




Let’s spread our literature to every corner of the world!



Building IT Systems are Expensive!

If we reach our initial goal of $ 100 000, the entire pool of funds will go into development and related costs. 







There are two programmers standing by to get started on development. The specification for the basic interface should be doable within the framework of the minimum funding goal of $100 000. 
Funds beyond this goal will be used to build:


Functionality for translations & editing.


Speed up development by engaging additional programming resources that are standing by.



We have made this funding plan, including stretch goals:







The long term ambition of developing self-service tools for creating Audio-books have been budgeted to an isolated development cost of approximately $250 000. The reason why we have kept this as a high hanging stretch goal, is the recognition of the need to consolidate core functionality for supporting traditional literature, before addressing a long term ambition. 

Between the lines in this crude funding plan, there are lots of details, including ISBN support, cross-border transaction solutions, reporting systems, PoD support for physical distribution options, etc.

The expected administration and IT costs of day-to-day operations for core functionality are considerable, and we will need a healthy business running as a foundation in order to pursue this long term ambition.


What if we fail to reach our goal?
If we fail to reach our goal, we will need to consider our course of action from what we have achieved. If we reach 50% or more, we will at least explore the possibility for additional external funding for the remaining half. Another option will be to scale down our ambitions, and get a simpler and cheaper solution running. 
External ownership is something we would prefer to avoid. Zhontors mission is to make reading and writing available to everyone, in sync with the expansion of connectivity to the internet. And while doing so, respecting the local traditions and culture, in which native languages play a key role. 
This is most definitely a ""low-profit & high-development"" based ambition. And that is something which professional investors looking to make a profit tend to object to.



    Other Ways You Can Help 
Spread the word!
If you find our endeavour exciting, please help us reach as many people as possible. Any way that you can help us get attention will be much appreciated!

Help us build content!
If we are to succeed after Zhontor is launched,  we will need a lot of content. So if you want to use its free features without investing, start making that content now. We will be ready to help you spread your literature when we launch!

Be creative!
Discuss and brainstorm with your friends on how this platform can be helpful to you in your everyday life, and give us feedback. 
We see many areas where this kind of platform can be useful to the public. 



What could we do to support educational institutions, to connect schools and universities across languages and borders? 


Could we provide some free content and do something worthwhile that benefits underprivileged societies? 


Creating and enjoying quality literature is one of the building blocks of civilizations, and everyone needs it! 

FaQ'sCan I publish my work free of charge for the readers?Yes!We hope that a great many will choose to provide free content. It is a dilemma that those that need access to quality literature the most, often are the ones that have the least. Reading and writing is a key element in any society, and our mission is to make it available to anyone - everywhere!Will you provide and support ISBN?Support for ISBN will be included from start. However, each country has their own way of providing ISBN series, so it seems we will need to invest separately for the ISBN series in each country.

Our advice would be to check your contract and to talk with your publisher. Depending on the terms in your contract, it might be possible to use Zhontor as a distribution channel, and access the translation features that way. But you need to check your contract and talk to your publisher.Can I publish short stories, poetry or other forms of literature?All forms of literature are welcome. And if the prose require a specific format for publishing, we will try and accommodate your needs. We also hope that the the community will find creative uses for our platform, like publishing their thesis from school, unlicenced research that the scientist wants to distribute or translate, etc.",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p><b>Who am I?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi my name is
Augustine Obeng, I am the author of ChangingLanes: A journey to find self. I am
a young writer from Jane and Finch.  I am
a University graduate from York University, having completed a degree in
Criminology and another in Education, with a minor in theatre. I am currently
and educator working for the Toronto District School Board, and Beyond 3:30
Afterschool program.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What the book is about?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This book is about a young boy who is a first generation immigrant to
Canada.  He ended up living in a marginalized community, with a lack of
resources.  He then finds himself struggling to choose a lane, deciding
what type of life he wants for himself.  He is having an identity Crisis, as
well, deciding weather to stay true to his tradition and religious
upbringing, or follow his friends and become immersed in the street
life.  The story goes on to highlight different monumental experiences and
individuals that have helped shape his life.  After several near
death experiences he decides to devote his life to helping others from his
community lead a positive life and ultimately change his lane from
negative path to positive and uplifting one.</p>
<p><b>What was the
inspiration for it?</b></p>
<p>If you are from where I’m from you quickly realize that positivity
in the community is hardly shown, glorified or promoted.  I often hear tragic stories of individuals,
dying, getting shot, or going to jail. I was tired of hearing such negative
stories. So I decided to tell a story that was positive. Although, it has elements
of negativity, I believe the story highlights some of the things that go on in Jane
and Finch, shining light on some of the intrinsic battles that one has within themselves,
when trying to find a way out. </p>
<p>I felt it was important to shine light on my story, identifying
some of the challenges that I have gone through in my life. </p>
<p><b>What makes my story
unique?</b></p>
<p>My story is unique because no one else has been through what
I have been through.  It is also rare for
an individual from my community to write a book at such a young age. I believe
I have the ability to reflect upon my experiences and learn life lessons from
them along the way. In addition, this book, is something that has taken a great
deal of time to retell as I have ben writing then events that occurred in my
life in real time, bringing a level of authenticity to my writing.  In addition to my story, I have added inserts
of poems that I had written during those specific time periods that speak to
the emotions and feelings that I had as I was going through it. My story is unique
because it brings a voice to the life of a first generation immigrant from
Ghana. </p>

</p>
<p>Here is where your support comes in; I need some assistance
raising some capital to pay for these things. 
I have already sacrificed a great deal of time, passion and commitment
to this project. I am currently applying for some grants but am waiting from responses.  I have decided to be proactive in the creation

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>In ExtraTerra V: Part One ‘The Mystery of the Cursed Island’ a group of five teenagers armed with fervent desire, knowledge, and courage reveal the secrets of a peculiar island as they prepare for a lunar expedition.</p>
<p>My name is Nick and I am the co-author of my first novel, ExtraTerra V: Part One ‘The Mystery of the Cursed Island’. It intrigued and inspired us to write this book when we heard that the history of the Moon is full of strange events without an explanation. In 2016, it was the 50th anniversary of the first manned Moon landing. We fantasized about what the world would look like as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the landing. What would an ordinary teenager in high school be like? What will happen 50 years from now? </p>
<p>We hope that, in reading this book, you’ll enjoy the future world we created and it will inspire you to build a magnificent future. Either by motivating others to become scientists or engineers, or by becoming one yourself, as technology evolves you’ll help usher in a new era when humans spend time on outposts outside the Earth looking for extraterrestrial life and solving old mysteries of space.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>The picture we painted has a science-fiction and adventure background with a pinch of mystery, and the finishing notes of a love story. Just for a short preview, imagine it’s the summer of 2069, five high school friends receive exciting news from the International Space Agency that their team, ‘ExtraTerra V’ won first place in an international science expo with a presentation called “How to Explore the Moon’s Anomalies”. The grand prize they receive is a flight to the Moon and participation in the international lunar expedition timed to coincide with the centenary of the first manned landing on the Moon.</p>
<p>The friends are enjoying their summer vacation, while waiting for a soon to come flight to the moon. They are planning to join other members of the expedition in ‘Lunaris’, a lunar city and the main Moon outpost that was built 10 years prior. Suddenly, a few days before the flight, they encounter a series of strange events. And before going to space to decode the Moon’s riddles, they must apply a lot of effort and knowledge to solve several complex mysteries on Earth, including what hides on the ‘Cursed Island’ in the San Juan Island Archipelago. </p>
<p>You’ll discover a lot of intriguing facts about the Moon and about technologies earthlings will use 50 years from now. Readers will learn how a space suit works in 2069, how people will fly to the moon using space liners with combined engines, the organization of the Moon city, and even how hypothetical extraterrestrial creatures on the Moon could look like. </p>
<h3>
<br/>Who is ExtraTerra V for?</h3>
<p>This book is for people looking to imagine a bright future filled with burgeoning technology. It’s for people who enjoy the suspense that comes with understanding a mystery. It’s for people who love the excitement of looking towards the alien worlds just beyond our sky.</p>
<p>We hope that ExtraTerra V pushes you to think deeper and ask yourself questions such as:</p>
<p>Who are we in this life and what is our purpose?</p>
<p>What knowledge should we arm ourselves with to uncover secrets of the Earth and space?</p>
<p>How do our interactions with others affect our lives positively or negatively?</p>
<p>We look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with our readers. We are interested in how you imagine the interaction between people, your vision of top-notch technologies, and the solution to environmental issues many years into the future.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will publish this book on Amazon. Funds raised will go towards:</p>
<p>The Structural Edit and Copy-Editing </p>
<p>The Book Cover Design &amp; Formatting</p>

<p>My name is Bryan Carpenter.  I was a United State Marine and I hit a roadside bomb in Iraq in 2006.  I was left badly injured and in a 2 1/2 week coma.  I woke up at 120 pounds and was guessed to never walk again independtly.  My path from June of 2006 until present day has been nothing but a miracle of recovery and it inspires so many people to push forward.  So I self published my book ""Never Ending Battle After Iraq - A Marine's Road to Recovery"" and it has motivated and moved so many people and touched many lives.</p>
<p>My main goal is to be represented by an agent to get me aligned with a commercial publishing company that will spread my story across the world.  In order to do this, I must hire a ghost writer to professionalize my book and extend it from 27,000 words to 60,000 words.  This also comes with a small cost.  I must raise the funds to be able to achieve this goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>In recent years, I've successfully crowdfunded two books and the birth of a baby, my son Mukisa. We also crowdfunded his preschool tuition. And now I'm launching this crowdfunding campaign for a splendidly hip new book, ""Too Hip for the Room: The Righteous Reign of Lord Buckley."" Let me tell you about it.</h3>
<p>For more years than I care to calculate my long time friends Michael Monteleone, Roger Mexico (the real one, not the Pynchon character, or maybe...) and I have been making a documentary film about the life of Lord Buckley, the hipster humorist/monologist known as the Hip Messiah who caught a cab in 1959. In so doing we have accumulated a daunting number of fascinating interviews, many dozen, with the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, George Carlin, Steve Allen, Joan Baez, Jonathan Winters, Anita O'Day and, well, the list goes on and on and on...</p>
<p>So it occured to me recently that publishing this material as a book will be fascinating in its own right, and also help promote the film. To do so, I'm launching this  campaign to raise $15,000. The material is in hand and I'm going through it now, selecting and organizing. We will have the book out and in the hands of contributors by the end of the year. We hope you will be one of those contributors. If you are, you will get thanked in the book's acknowledgements, of course (unless you wish to be anonymous) and you'll get one of the first copies of the book. Feel free to get in touch with questions. And please pass on the link to this page to friends who may be interested in the project.</p>

<p><strong>What's the story?</strong><br/>Every year, right before hibernation, all the bears in the forest gather for a rousing game of Bear Hockey. But wait...what IS Bear Hockey? Well, it's not exactly like regular hockey, that's for sure. Basically, it's the most fun game you've never played! The rules are simple:</p>
<p><strong>The Rules of Bear Hockey</strong><br/>1. You use MANY pine cones instead of one puck.<br/>2. You high five all the players and spectators multiple times before you start playing.<br/>3. You take frequent, frequent, FREQUENT honey breaks.<br/>4. When the last pine cone is scored, it's time for HIBERNATION! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>* We will be using the funds raised here to print Bear Hockey. We want to get it into the hands of as many friends and fans as we can!</p>
<p>* We are offering a few reward levels that we know you'll love. We'll be using the funds raised here to create some pretty cool swag.</p>
<p>* If we don't reach our goal, we will still be able to fulfill any orders here; we have a successful Kickstarter campaign backing us up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bear Hockey is a very special story and it's the very first book created by Buttertart Books. We are so excited that you can join us on this journey!

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks when it comes to the art or copy; the book is 100% done! The only minor risk would be in producing the actual books. We have a printer lined up, so any risk would just be a slight delay. But we don't think that's going to happen!</p>

<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Lumin Journal</h3>
<p>Lumin Journal is an independently run arts publication, looking for funding for its first issue. </p>
<p>Currently non-profit, it was created by Cardiff based artists Beau Beakhouse and Sadia Pineda Hameed to be an alternative for Welsh and Bristol based artists to get their artwork out there in a way that respects the art itself and puts the artist first. Often it means finding artists who are outside the normal rubric of what is palatable enough to publish. Abstract and experimental work, work that is critical of institutions (political, social, academic etc.), work by under-represented groups, or artists who have never been published before; and are finding it hard to enter into the exclusive art world. </p>
<p>The online and print journal will provide them with a platform to share their artwork and to create articles with their own creative and lucid expression. As well as this, Lumin will be publishing artists books by a number of writers and visual artists, and putting on shows, events and artist exhibitions; creating a new arts scene in the city and wider. We aim to be able to pay artists for their work in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the first issue, we are trying to cover the costs of printing, and all the additional costs that came with setting up the journal, so that we can bring the work of the artists to life in the way that would best suit their art. With this initial funding, in addition to any money earned from future fundraising events, Lumin will hopefully be self-sustaining from then on. </p>
<p><strong><u>Funds breakdown</u></strong></p>
<p>We are looking for a minimum of £300 for the first print run. Any money raised on top of this would go towards funding our artist chapbooks. A rough breakdown of the costs being: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>£170 for printing the first fifty issues </strong>- initially we planned to home print, however found that the quality didn't serve the vividness of the art and photography. This £170 includes recycled paper, and costs from a local printing service. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>£143 for printing and binding materials, and design</strong> - This includes materials for thread-binding and paper-cutting; as well as ornaments and pull-outs that will come attached to the journal. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The additional £200 would go towards funding our artists' chapbooks and paying artists </strong>- This would include the usual printing costs and recycled paper. With the chapbooks, we are hoping to publish artists' work and help distribute/sell the books for them, with as much of the profit as possible going straight to the artist. </li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the more of this additional funding we get after the first £300, the cheaper we can sell the journal, making it more accessible. </p>
<p><u><strong>What you get</strong></u></p>
<p>You can donate as much or as little as you can afford; however we also have a rewards tier which includes a personalised thank you on an art postcard, a crystal associated with our first issue, a copy of the first issue, and a print bundle with future issues and artist chapbooks. Do check it out..</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So far, Lumin have been trying to create a new creative scene around Cardiff city.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Our online platform luminjournal.com</strong> <strong>has been publishing underground artists over the last year. </strong>The website also publishes blogs about other creative happenings such as Made in Roath's night walk, and monthly playlists.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>We have also set up a creative space installation at Three Doors Up, Lumin Library;</strong> a creative space with books donated by local artists. As a deinstitutionalised space, books can be taken out with no due dates, and the space itself can be used for creative happenings, exhibitions and meeting up or reading.<br/> </li>
<li>As for the journal launch itself, we will be using it as an opportunity to hold a <strong>two week art exhibition and poetry reading </strong>at arts space Three Doors Up for the contributing artists - many of whom have never been exhibited/read before.  Here's the link to the Facebook event for more info: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/581178772222490/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/581178772222490/</a> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The obvious risk would be not raising the minimum £300 for the first print run. To overcome this, it may be that we have to print less copies initially, and then do a second print-run as more funds slowly come in. </p>
<p>Other challenges we face are getting our journal stocked in enough locations; however we are currently working on this, with several places in Cardiff as confirmed stockists, alongside setting up an online store. </p>
<p>In terms of long term funding methods, we are going to apply for various funding schemes, the Wales Arts Council and Cardiff University (of which we are graduates) for support with printing costs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any amount would seriously help us out, as currently we have been paying for the journal and our installation Lumin Library ourselves. If you can't donate, then other ways you can help Lumin Journal out would be by sharing our events on social media, buying an issue, or just coming along to our events/the library to support the artists.

<h3>The Business Innovation Book</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/The.Business.Innovation.Book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>The Business innovation Book </strong></u></a>presents the basics of Innovation management theory in 280 pages in a very easy and understandable way.</p>
<p>In my opinion, innovation theory can help you take advantage from the lessons learnt in the innovation practice and that can be the chasm between failing and achieving successful innovations. Unfortunately, people underestimate innovation theory. I have observed many business cases when innovation theory gives the right answers! That may be is the one missing course in your studies with the highest impact on your success!</p>
<p>I was writing <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/The.Business.Innovation.Book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>The Business Innovation Book </strong></u></a>more than 2 years and now finally it is ready. It aims at opening your mind, going out of the box, researching all possible options, not being afraid of failure, being constructive and systematic in your approach.</p>
<p>The potential readers are students, innovation practitioners, start-up people, believers, innovation enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and people working in corporations too. It is for all those who want to work better, to achieve more, to be the fastest, to be the first, to solve problems, to be leaders, to ask for more, to share their opinion and knowledge, to take advantage over the competition, to be active instead of passive, and to make money from all this. It is for innovators and want-to-be innovators.</p>
<p>It is for those of you who are studying Innovation and as well for you who are not studying it at all. This is your missing ingredient in your knowledge about Innovation.</p>

The Business innovation Book presents the basics of Innovation management theory in 280 pages in a very easy and understandable way.
In my opinion, innovation theory can help you take advantage from the lessons learnt in the innovation practice and that can be the chasm between failing and achieving successful innovations. Unfortunately, people underestimate innovation theory. I have observed many business cases when innovation theory gives the right answers! That may be is the one missing course in your studies with the highest impact on your success!
I was writing The Business Innovation Book more than 2 years and now finally it is ready. It aims at opening your mind, going out of the box, researching all possible options, not being afraid of failure, being constructive and systematic in your approach.
The potential readers are students, innovation practitioners, start-up people, believers, innovation enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, and people working in corporations too. It is for all those who want to work better, to achieve more, to be the fastest, to be the first, to solve problems, to be leaders, to ask for more, to share their opinion and knowledge, to take advantage over the competition, to be active instead of passive, and to make money from all this. It is for innovators and want-to-be innovators.
It is for those of you who are studying Innovation and as well for you who are not studying it at all. This is your missing ingredient in your knowledge about Innovation.

<li><p><strong>Come join us, be part of the excitement!</strong>  We hear, ""But I'm not a writer.""  Ok, but maybe your daughter will be or your grandson, but where would we be without the writing that fills our world?</p></li>
<li>Cheryl Nugent, President and Founder of Kentbury has free-lanced for magazines, was a staff writer for a small town newspaper and worked at the American Press Institute in Reston, VA.

<div><ul>
<li><p>The time-challenged, agent, editor, publisher, will have <strong>the luxury of browsing </strong>through the town, visiting the virtual bookshops representing each genre. The whole manuscript will not be there, but there will be enough to know if they want to see more and can then contact the writer directly!  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Kentbury is essentially a place where industry professionals and serious writers can meet and mingle.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Most of the funds we raise will be used for Marketing and Promotion; this will include attending book fairs and writer's conferences and creating promotional material.  </p></li>
<li><p>The site is not yet open for membership, but every is in place to begin and we plan to be up and running by fall!</p></li>
<li><p><u><strong>Compelling Stats</strong></u>:  Last year alone, 600,000 to 1 million books were published in the US! About half were self-published and the average sale per book was only about 250.  The market is huge and a little lopsided, but it can be better!  Worldwide, publishing is in the millions! </p></li>
<li><p>We intend to offer <strong>Kentbury Scholarships</strong>, logically linked to the literary world. As we grow and increase membership, we want to support education in the world of writers!  Oh, and let's not forget the <strong>Readers! </strong>They will surely benefit as well.</p></li>
<li><p>We are working on <strong>Writing Contests</strong>, always a great incentive and way to encourage the wonderful ""citizens"" of our virtual community!</p></li>
</ul></div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>PERKS</strong> - Incentives and thank yous!  We are offering a fun selection of perks, some coming  from supporters who love Kentbury and want it to succeed, and most link directly to the world of books.  We have the expected <strong>books, bookends, paperweights, </strong>but since a writer can write about ANYTHING, we are thrilled to offer<strong> original Kimberly Ann greeting cards, </strong> each one hand-crafted and unique.  <strong>Finely crafted Ornaments from Barbara Yeatman, master-craftsman at The Wooden Dog</strong>.  <strong>We have just added a SURPRISE PERK!</strong></p></li>
<li><p> <strong>Honorary Titles </strong>to be part of this vibrant community, like<strong> Town Council, Librarian, Town Crier, Fence Viewer, Lighthouse Keeper, Town Scribe, and Nomenclator!  Opt in as a  Founding Father (and your T-Shirt can say Founding Mother or Father) </strong>and have your name in our virtual town square! </p></li>
<li><p>Your ""responsibilities"" if you join our virtual community with an honorary title... are ... virtually ...nothing.  Only have your name appear on one of the lovely monuments designed by our talented webmaster.  You will be invited to have your photo and a short bio,  but only if you wish.</p></li>
<li><p> Have <strong>your name on the quaint shops </strong>offering the many genres, like Mystery Book Store, Cookbooks, Children's Bookstore etc!   We are offering <strong>signed books, first editions and an original children's book written for a special child </strong>in a theme you can choose!  <strong>Kentbury Memberships </strong>will also be offered at a discount to supporters. <strong>New perks will be added through the 35-day campaign, so please come back often to see what's new!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We are 100% committed to this project, and support from <strong>you</strong> will make it happen!</p></li>
<li><p> Every publisher/agent dreams of finding great work. The list of bestsellers, award-winning work that was rejected, missed, overlooked, is long, even fascinating, when you realize just what a precarious world it can be for the fledgling manuscript waiting for the right person to come and find it! Available 24/7 around the world!</p></li>
<li>Kentbury is ""<strong>A Novel Destination""</strong> for writers to be seen, and for talent scouts to find them!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The creator of Kentbury is a writer but we are working with other writers and advisors from the business and marketing world.  We believe in listening and in quality customer service.</p></li>
<li><p>Writers, agents and editors are lining up and ask when the site will be ready.  With your support, we hope that will be very soon!  While not yet re-designed,  you can see the original site at <strong>Kentbury.com. </strong>Be sure and check out the FAQs, and the Mystery, Romance and Children's genres to get an idea of our vision and how it works!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div><div><ul>
<li><p>Having passion for something is a wonderful feeling.  It keeps you focused, determined, willing to acknowledge mistakes and learn from them. The small team working hard to make Kentbury come to life represents the business world and the creative world, a powerful combination.  Our challenges are being met head on.</p></li>
<li><p>If you agree that this is a terrific concept, please consider backing it. Writers are often the least recognized in the creative industry. Your favorite film, TV show, the song that transports you, the birthday card with the beautiful message... you seldom know who wrote them, but someone with a creative heart put them out there for the world to see!</p></li>
<li>SO FAR, we have spent $5,500, half to the original webmaster and provider, which we are now re-designing at @<strong>$3,500</strong>.  We had <strong>attorney fees</strong> to trademark and copyright Kentbury, <strong>business license</strong>, all of the expected things in getting started.  Now, as we re-desgn the website with a new provider, we are raising funds for that and also for <strong>Marketing</strong> which will be a vital component in getting the word out.  We will be attending <strong>Book Fairs and Conferences,</strong> <strong>Literary Conventions</strong>, from CA to SC, Carolina Mountains Literary Festival and the Boucheron Convention in Fl, all important for any new venture, especially so for something new and unique.</li>
</ul></div><div><ul>
<li><p>Funds are great, but <strong>YOUR SUPPORT</strong> is appreciated in any way you can think of.  Tell your friends, mention us on your social media pages, networking and word-of-mouth promotion will never be underestimated or under-appreciated!  </p></li>
<li><p>As the Perks are claimed, we will add new ones, so check back often!</p></li>
<li><p>Indiegogo is amazing, so don't forget to use their friendly share tools!  <strong>Thank you!!</strong></p></li>

 Have your name on the quaint shops offering the many genres, like Mystery Book Store, Cookbooks, Children's Bookstore etc!   We are offering signed books, first editions and an original children's book written for a special child in a theme you can choose!  Kentbury Memberships will also be offered at a discount to supporters. New perks will be added through the 35-day campaign, so please come back often to see what's new!
We are 100% committed to this project, and support from you will make it happen!
 Every publisher/agent dreams of finding great work. The list of bestsellers, award-winning work that was rejected, missed, overlooked, is long, even fascinating, when you realize just what a precarious world it can be for the fledgling manuscript waiting for the right person to come and find it! Available 24/7 around the world!
Kentbury is ""A Novel Destination"" for writers to be seen, and for talent scouts to find them!


The creator of Kentbury is a writer but we are working with other writers and advisors from the business and marketing world.  We believe in listening and in quality customer service.
Writers, agents and editors are lining up and ask when the site will be ready.  With your support, we hope that will be very soon!  While not yet re-designed,  you can see the original site at Kentbury.com. Be sure and check out the FAQs, and the Mystery, Romance and Children's genres to get an idea of our vision and how it works!
RISKS & CHALLENGES


Having passion for something is a wonderful feeling.  It keeps you focused, determined, willing to acknowledge mistakes and learn from them. The small team working hard to make Kentbury come to life represents the business world and the creative world, a powerful combination.  Our challenges are being met head on.
If you agree that this is a terrific concept, please consider backing it. Writers are often the least recognized in the creative industry. Your favorite film, TV show, the song that transports you, the birthday card with the beautiful message... you seldom know who wrote them, but someone with a creative heart put them out there for the world to see!
SO FAR, we have spent $5,500, half to the original webmaster and provider, which we are now re-designing at @$3,500.  We had attorney fees to trademark and copyright Kentbury, business license, all of the expected things in getting started.  Now, as we re-desgn the website with a new provider, we are raising funds for that and also for Marketing which will be a vital component in getting the word out.  We will be attending Book Fairs and Conferences, Literary Conventions, from CA to SC, Carolina Mountains Literary Festival and the Boucheron Convention in Fl, all important for any new venture, especially so for something new and unique.

Funds are great, but YOUR SUPPORT is appreciated in any way you can think of.  Tell your friends, mention us on your social media pages, networking and word-of-mouth promotion will never be underestimated or under-appreciated!  
As the Perks are claimed, we will add new ones, so check back often!
Indiegogo is amazing, so don't forget to use their friendly share tools!  Thank you!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>It's time for JAMM... issue #4 !!!</strong></p>
<p>Just A Minor Malfunction... is an independent science-fiction e-zine, dedicated to publishing quality, thought-provoking, professionally-edited sci-fi.  We take submissions, and no story will receive a form letter rejection.</p>
<p>After the launch of JAMM... issue #1 ( <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G223BWS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G223BWS</a> ), issue #2 ( <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NA9QRAY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NA9QRAY</a> ), and issue #3 ( <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072N1RMFL"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072N1RMFL</a> ), each with 13 from independent authors, it's time for issue #4!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Editor</strong></p>
<p>My name is Michael S. Alter, and I am a life-long sci-fi fan.  I grew up reading Asimov's and Analog, Heinlein and Clarke.  I love the stories, although editing errors would always throw me.</p>
<p>A few years back I started writing my own stories, and earlier this year I decided to try my hand at publishing.  I launched issue #1 with several key ideas in mind:</p>
<p>No form letters to authors submitting a story.  I'll always give you at least some personalized feedback.</p>
<p>Sharing the profits with the authors.  All authors receive a share of the proceeds according to a formula.</p>
<p>Authors retain the rights to their work, even after my edits.  I only keep the right to continue publishing the story as part of the issue of the magazine.</p>
<p>Low-priced, high-quality sci-fi, a lucky 13 stories per issue.  I'm a strong editor, I'll work with my authors to put out only the best stories.  I have additional reviewers/editors who have kept me honest, too.  (Thanks again to Louise Sorensen and Mel McElveen!)</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make big money out of this, only enough to take my wife out for a nice dinner! ;-)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>Sci-fi!  It'll make you think, and maybe open your eyes a little to the future coming at us.  There'll be 13 sci-fi stories (maybe 30,000 to 50,000 words total), plus an article from the editor (that's me!) about the future in the real world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>No risks at all.  I'm receiving a number of good stories (more than halfway filled up for issue #4 already), and I have a half-dozen of my own stories ready to publish, though I only expect to put one of my own (or none) in issue #4.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Submitting a Story</strong></p>
<p>If you'd like to submit a story, send it (as text in the body of the email, please!) to:</p>

<p>4,000 words of less (I'm not super-strict about that one)</p>
<p>PG-13 or tamer (a bit more strict here, but there is a gray area)</p>
<p>Has to be a work where you own all the rights</p>
<p>Science fiction, or maybe tales of the weird with a little sci-fi in it.  No swords and sorcery, please!</p>

<h3>How it began</h3>
<p>I had moved back to Fishtown after five years away, a writer who couldn't write. It was the mid-Aughts and the neighborhood was going through a real estate boom, one that is still going on. Things were changing. So instead of sitting and staring down the blinking cursor at the top of a blank document on my computer screen, I started to walk around the neighborhood taking pictures. </p>
<p>The cartons were everywhere. On the sidewalks, under the brush in weedy vacant lots, in the gutters and gathered at the storm drains. They seemed forlorn and forgotten. I watched them age and fall apart. They took on personalities. I started thinking about them like they were characters, and I started to write down some thoughts. </p>

<h2><strong>Plovdiv, Bulgaria</strong></h2>
<p>The city I fell in love with and remained her true.</p>
<p>Plovdiv is one of the oldest cities in the world and surely the oldest continuously inhabited city in Europe. Archaeologists have proven that Plovdiv was founded around 6000 BC. In the Antiquity Plovdiv took the name “the City of the Seven Hills” - it rests on the seven ancient hills spread along the banks of the mighty Maritsa River.</p>
<p>Plovdiv lies in the middle of the fertile Upper – Thracian Plain, fenced by the Rhodope Mountains (the legendary homeland of Orpheus) in the south and guarded by the Balkan Mountain Range in the north.</p>
<p>Plovdiv is the first Bulgarian city to be the European Capital of Culture.</p>

<p>The Kapana area is Plovdiv’s bohemian district. The name means “the trap”. This neighbourhood got this name because it is easy to get lost in its myriad side streets.

</div></div>","Plovdiv, Bulgaria
The city I fell in love with and remained her true.
Plovdiv is one of the oldest cities in the world and surely the oldest continuously inhabited city in Europe. Archaeologists have proven that Plovdiv was founded around 6000 BC. In the Antiquity Plovdiv took the name “the City of the Seven Hills” - it rests on the seven ancient hills spread along the banks of the mighty Maritsa River.
Plovdiv lies in the middle of the fertile Upper – Thracian Plain, fenced by the Rhodope Mountains (the legendary homeland of Orpheus) in the south and guarded by the Balkan Mountain Range in the north.
Plovdiv is the first Bulgarian city to be the European Capital of Culture.
The Ancient Roman Theater is the landmark of Plovdiv. It was built in the 1st century AD and is one of the best preserved in the world.
The fortresses of Plovdiv hosted Thracian princes, ancient Greek leaders; Roman emperors, Bulgarian kings and Ottoman Sultans, and all of them have left their imprints on the architecture and the cultural landscape of the city.



The Kapana area is Plovdiv’s bohemian district. The name means “the trap”. This neighbourhood got this name because it is easy to get lost in its myriad side streets. Kapana is where many of the city's musicians and artists hang out in the evenings. Plovdiv has a lively scene with many young people involved in artistic activities.



In Plovdiv’s Old Town, cobbled streets meander between charming 18th and 19th-century buildings. These colorfully painted houses date back to the National Revival, a flourishing period for the Bulgarian architecture and literature.
Plovdiv has all the right ingredients for a brief (or not so brief) city escape: a cobblestoned Old Town, impressive ancient ruins and archaeology, lively drinking and dining scene, and above all – art. This is a pedestrian-friendly city with an easy-going attitude as genuine as anywhere on the Balkans.
Still haunted by the omnipresent past, Plovdiv is nonetheless a modern city focused on the future. Let me walk you through the romantic places of Plovdiv.

About 20% kids experience bullying at school. One of them was my daughter.  According to UNESCO, 33% of the world's youth is bullied. Thinking about how to prevent other kids being bullied, I have written the first of a series of books (The Youth Project Books) to help children cope with difficulties in life.  I'm an award-winning creative writer and single mom, and I'm confident that children can learn kindness and respect to end bullying. 
 
WALLY AND THE BULLY LION
Wally and the Bully Lion is a beautiful book aimed to kids in elementary school to learn how to stand up for themselves, raise their self-esteem and teach them that bullying is not cool.
 

 
Illustrated by US Navy Veteran Jeffery Thigpen and colored by 13-year-old Fiorella Maurizio, the book tells an uplifting story in an Animal Sanctuary where Wally the Warthog is being bullied by Louis the Lion and his friends for being ""ugly"". One day, Peter the Platypus comes to Wally's life to teach him that he is perfect and amazing just the way he is.  
 

 
By helping us bring The Youth Project Books into life with the first book Wally and the Bully Lion, together we can make a difference in children's lives. We have the power of changing the environment where our new generations are growing up for good.
**For five books sold, we will donate one to an underprivileged child.**
So far we have partnered with Southgate Community Center in Reston, Virginia, to donate the books, but I'm open to extend it to other non-profit organizations that also help children in need. 
 

Helping Kids have Happier Lives!
Our goal is to raise a minimum of $10,000 to print Wally and the Bully Lion books and coloring books in order to sell, donate and help youth organizations. This will help funding the creation of the second book, Penny and her Two Lucky Homes. The idea is to have a series of 7 books to help children cope with difficulties and have happier lives.
 
We have beautiful perks like stickers, kid's t-shirts, bookmarks, and signed books with encouraging messages for children.

I also wrote Renegades about the iconic steelband, and my doctoral thesis, published as Tin Pan to TASPO, Origins of the Steelband Movement 1939-1951.Left: Captain, tuner and arranger for Trinidad All Stars Neville Jules, chatting with the author. I have lectured a lot on the steelpan at universities, at the Smithsonian Institute (Anacostia Museum), at TedX. I curated the multi-media exhibition “The Audacity of the Creole Imagination”, and directed and/or wrote two prize-winning films on steelpan: Re-Percussions, and PAN! Our Music Odyssey. And in 2011 I published what I consider to be my magnum opus, The Illustrated Story of Pan, first edition.Now that I have updated and re-designed it, I will, with your help, print a Second Edition.What we needWe need to raise $15,000 USD to edit, design and print 1,500 copies of the Second Edition. Any support will be welcome and will receive a shout-out on our social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram. For upwards of $50 we will show our appreciation with:
Autographed Book – US$50
Autographed Book + 1 Tote bag – US$75
Two Autographed Books + 2 Tote Bags + 1 set of postcards – US $100
Four Autographed books, 4 Tote bags + 4 packs of postcards – US $200
In addition to The Illustrated Story of Pan, Second Edition, your perks for supporting are:Tote Bags These feature graphic art from the first Panorama ad in 1963 and are included for the second level of support.​ Postcards Vintage steelpan photos were sold as postcards. For you, we have reprinted five of these gorgeous archival postcards not used in The Illustrated Story.  They can be mounted for display or used as notes to family and friends, or as beautiful pagemarkers in a beautiful book.  Risks & ChallengesThe main challenge we anticipate is shipping.  We have included postage to the Caribbean, North America and the UK in the price of the perks.  We do not want to exclude the rest of the world but, unfortunately, shipping to other regions will have to be added to the cost of the item. Cuba: Due to OFAC regulations Indiegogo does not provide shipping options for Cuba.  If you reside in Cuba and want to support+receive a perk that includes shipping, please contact us directly. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute, there are other ways you can help. Spread the word, share our Facebook posts and emails, tell all your music friends about the campaign.  If you know of steelpan or steelband events in your area, we can provide information that you can share with the general public.  Is there a Caribbean radio station in your area?  What about eateries?  Any place where you feel there are interested persons, share the info!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

People really need to know how they communicate on a conscious and unconscious level but also improve their mindset and inner dialogue. The result: less stress, more effective non-violent communication, connection, and trust.  Her tools: body language, non-violent communication, stress management advice, and mental coaching. She gets goosebumps when transforming people’s mindset and body language from negative to positive during a coaching session.  Her initial interest in non-verbal communcation and coaching grew out of curiosity and the urge to understand human interactions. In her years as a career coach, she helped many people reconnect with themselves, their needs, and their talents. She also helped clients learn to identify and assess stress so that they can execute a stress management plan. As a team, we are organized, driven, and committed to delivering you a book that not only will inspire people to combat stress through Garry's story but also will deliver tools to measure, map, and overcome stress issues.  We humbly ask for your support and we value your hard-earned money. The ImpactThis project started with the creation of our award-winning film (and Indiegogo funded) Destressedfilm.com and led to the building of a community of fans. Now, we have the opportunity to turn this support into an book that can become a part of your personal library. We will kick off the celebration of the film’s 5th Anniversary with some screenings with Q&A this year.  We’re hoping to culminate the celebrations by publishing our book that will inspire your search for sanity in an insane world and also includes stress management questions and tools to help you reflect and move forward.The degree to which you support this project will determine the extent of the possibilities for this  book going forward in terms of marketing.  Destressed 2the movie is also in the talks.  We can't overstate the impact that a massive wave of support for this project will have on the people we reach.  Risks & ChallengesThere are no risks.  The manuscript is 95% finished and we currently have an editor reviewing it.  The challenge is to impact more people lives with our book which is why we need additional funds.  The more funds we have, the more people we can help.  Other Ways You Can Help Please help us get the word out about this project and thank you for taking the time to consider supporting our book and contributing to people finding sanity in an insane world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Draper, better known as Captain Crunch, the original ""Phone Phreak"". From his early days of facing off against Ma Bell to his current role in public speaking and privacy advocacy, it’s hard to overstate his impact on the world of technology. Along the way, he developed some of the most influential tools of the computer revolution, from the first working word processor in the seventies to the first effective firewall in the nineties. The road hasn’t always been smooth, however, and for every success there have been setbacks and hurdles of literary proportion. Let’s just call it Draperism. </p><p>This ""warts and all"" biography features Draper's own telling of stories from the past fifty years, as well as commentary and other memories from his long-time friend and collaborator. It is the story of an eccentric genius who went from being a penniless hacker to a millionaire and back again, a man so consumed by his vision that the real world around him has always played second fiddle. Featuring a foreword by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and cameos by the who’s who of early computing, this Kerouacian journey gives us an inside look at the birth of modern computing through the eyes of one of its most influential pioneers.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532172085/hycfhkpbbdb58wwvw0rm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We are keeping this as simple as possible.

Among other things he developed the 'Charlie Board', an early version of a PC modem predating the DC Hayes modem. He also wrote the first word processing program, EasyWriter, for the Apple II and beat Bill Gates to the punch when it was bundled with the first IBM PC.</p><p>In the decades that followed Mr Draper worked with various notable people. In the 1980's he worked on Advanced 3-D Graphic Design Systems at Autodesk. In the 1990's he developed a revolutionary computer security system, considered un-hackable at the time.</p><p>Before all of that, he was an outlaw. In the early 1970's he was one of the 'Phone Phreaks', a group of enthusiasts who found various ways to hack the phone company and get free calls. Mr Draper became the most infamous member, and taught a lot of other people what he knew. He introduced Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs to the ‘Blue Box’, the device he used to perform some of his crimes. Steve Jobs is quoted as saying that without the Blue Box, there would be no Apple Computer. Mr Draper was hunted by the FBI for years, and went to prison three times.</p><p>In the last decade he has toured the world, telling his story, and speaking publicly about security flaws in telecommunications, online privacy, and encryption.<br/> </p><h3>The Narrative</h3><p>This book recounts stories from my years of knowing John T. Draper personally, interspersed with collected memories from his friends and relatives, and John’s personal history in his own words.

<br/>The Excerpts<br/> </h3><p><strong>Childhood anecdote by brother, Ron Draper</strong></p><p>There was this ‘mom and pop’ super market at the end of Edith St. in Petaluma, called 'The A &amp; B market'. It had light bulbs and licorice. John wanted bulbs. PR-2’s, PR-4 flashlight bulbs, and batteries, but as usual we had no money. Our mom would not concede to John’s wishes this time (these 'wishes' turned into outright demands when he became a teen), so we resorted to theft.</p><p>I can honestly say it wasn’t my idea. We had never stolen anything up to this point. I think I was blackmailed actually, but my dim memories don’t have the details. We thought we would use my calm demeanor and appointed me to actually steal most of the stuff. So, I was the one caught by the store manager as we were walking out.</p><p>We were asked to empty our pockets. I don’t remember what John had, but my pockets were loaded. I mean really loaded. 110v light bulbs, Christmas tree light bulbs, flashlight bulbs, AA batteries for my pen light (well, I thought, while I’m at it). I remember the store clerk adding up all the charges and it came to quite an amount.</p><p><strong>John and the Phone Phreaks</strong></p><p>I got a phone call from someone calling himself Denny San Jose, who told me he knew about various methods of making free phone calls. He also said there was this whistle that blew the magic tone that disconnects long distance calls, and that he had a spare. He asked me if I could drive him to San Francisco so he could show me how it worked.</p><p>---</p><p>I began to realise there was more to these guys than I first thought. They were a connected and organized group, and seemed to be inviting me to join. When the discussion got around to our trip to Burlingame, we talked about what my ‘handle’ should be. Most people had just chosen their first name and city, like ‘Denny San Jose’ or ‘Bill from New York’. Well, ‘John San Jose’ was already taken, so I said ‘how about Captain Crunch?’</p><p><strong>The first bust</strong></p><p>I suspected the FBI knew about me even before the Esquire article was released, but I had no idea how much they wanted to collar me. Up to that point all they had was the name Captain Crunch, but no way of finding out who I actually was. Most of the blind kids didn't know my phone number, and those who did had no need to write it down, but of course eventually I made the mistake of giving my number to the wrong person.</p><p>---</p><p>I made sure that I had removed all of my 'forbidden equipment' from my car, and stashed it in my gym locker. I took a non-working Blue Box out of my locker to take home and fix, put it in the back of my car then started the drive home. I stopped at a 7-11 to get a soda. I parked in a small parking lot next to a middle school, and just as I got out of the car, four FBI agents swooped down on me, handcuffed me, and read me my rights.</p><p><strong>Lompoc Prison</strong></p><p>In the 70's and 80's, they called Lompoc a Country Club. It was even home to Nixon's sleazy Watergate lawyer for a while, as well as many other celebrity prisoners.

Draper, better known as Captain Crunch, the original ""Phone Phreak"". From his early days of facing off against Ma Bell to his current role in public speaking and privacy advocacy, it’s hard to overstate his impact on the world of technology. Along the way, he developed some of the most influential tools of the computer revolution, from the first working word processor in the seventies to the first effective firewall in the nineties. The road hasn’t always been smooth, however, and for every success there have been setbacks and hurdles of literary proportion. Let’s just call it Draperism. This ""warts and all"" biography features Draper's own telling of stories from the past fifty years, as well as commentary and other memories from his long-time friend and collaborator. It is the story of an eccentric genius who went from being a penniless hacker to a millionaire and back again, a man so consumed by his vision that the real world around him has always played second fiddle. Featuring a foreword by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and cameos by the who’s who of early computing, this Kerouacian journey gives us an inside look at the birth of modern computing through the eyes of one of its most influential pioneers.We are keeping this as simple as possible. Six tiers of backer support with six simple reward packages. There is a support level for every budget.Pledge $15 for the ePHREAK perk, and you get an eBook and vector graphic of the PHREAK graphic, which will be sent out the day after campaign ends and you make final verifications.

Among other things he developed the 'Charlie Board', an early version of a PC modem predating the DC Hayes modem. He also wrote the first word processing program, EasyWriter, for the Apple II and beat Bill Gates to the punch when it was bundled with the first IBM PC.In the decades that followed Mr Draper worked with various notable people. In the 1980's he worked on Advanced 3-D Graphic Design Systems at Autodesk. In the 1990's he developed a revolutionary computer security system, considered un-hackable at the time.Before all of that, he was an outlaw. In the early 1970's he was one of the 'Phone Phreaks', a group of enthusiasts who found various ways to hack the phone company and get free calls. Mr Draper became the most infamous member, and taught a lot of other people what he knew. He introduced Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs to the ‘Blue Box’, the device he used to perform some of his crimes. Steve Jobs is quoted as saying that without the Blue Box, there would be no Apple Computer. Mr Draper was hunted by the FBI for years, and went to prison three times.In the last decade he has toured the world, telling his story, and speaking publicly about security flaws in telecommunications, online privacy, and encryption. The NarrativeThis book recounts stories from my years of knowing John T. Draper personally, interspersed with collected memories from his friends and relatives, and John’s personal history in his own words. It spans his 74 years on the planet, and my 22 years of knowing him.I have been John's roommate several times, business partner, and close friend over the years. I have always considered him a very interesting case for character study, and an unfathomable wealth of complexities and paradoxes.I hope to have portrayed him in an honest but affectionate light. A balanced portrait of the incredible story that is his life.- Craig Wilson FraserJohn T. Draper & Craig Wilson Fraser, Spain, 2015

<br/>My name is Lydhia Marie. I'm twenty-two and I received my degree in English literature last spring. I am currently moving in a new city and have no job other than write ideas on my keyboard and hope to be able to publish them soon. :)<br/>During my last summer at university, I decided to write a novel. Not because I'd had a dream or because I'd always loved writing. I needed to start a new project and decided that I was going to write a story. <br/>At first, the idea was quite basic, but as time went and words were thrown on a page, I discovered a passion and the story around my comatose student grew into a brand new world filled with monsters and danger.<br/>That's how I fell in love with writing. And that's how I knew that as long as I can write, I can never be bored.<br/>I finished writing the novel in two months... I know what you're thinking right now: It was probably really crappy.<br/>AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!<br/>It was.<br/>It <i>really</i> was.<br/>BUT the idea behind the poor writing wasn't. At least I and beta readers still don't think so.<br/>So after I attended a three-week creative writing course at the University of Oxford in England, I decided to rewrite my novel from top to bottom. And I couldn't even begin to summarize the changes I've made. Actually, just picture Beast in <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> before and mostly <i>after</i> Belle's declaration.</div>
<div>Now that my piece has a nice, handsome face, an interesting core, and a hot and muscular bottom, what should I do with it?<br/>That's where I need YOU.<br/>Yes, it's a nice dream to publish a novel.<br/>And yes, it's a lot of fun to publish your novel on your own, but it does take a little money to do so.</div>

<h3>(French translation) Voici le court résumé de mon roman:</h3>
<p>           Vous
êtes-vous déjà demandé ce qui influence votre personnalité? Votre humeur? Les
choix que vous faites dans la vie?</p>
<p>  Lorsqu’Amya reprend
conscience à l’hôpital, elle réalise qu’elle est incapable de se réveiller,
mais aussi qu’elle a perdu la mémoire de plus de onze mois de sa vie. À partir
d’information donné par sa famille et ses amis qui viennent la visiter, elle se
souvient graduellement des évènements qui l’ont fait rentrer dans un coma.
Surtout, elle se souvient d’avoir la capacité de Séjourner, de projeter son âme
dans le corps des autres, ainsi que la connaissance des Dimensions.  </p>
<p>  Mais quand Amya trouve finalement
un moyen de se réveiller, elle s’aperçoit que tout ce qui l’entoure est bouleversé.
Sa meilleure amie Samera a besoin de son aide et lui suggère fortement de
reprendre son poste au sein des Protecteurs d’Amani, son copain n’agit plus
comme avant et son ami Xander est victime d’une morsure de Rascal. Un Rascal
étant un être surnaturel qui a l’apparence d’un humain, mais qui doit se
nourrir de l’humanité des gens pour survivre. Certaine que Xander est sur le
point de se transformer en cette créature, Amya se voit face à un grand dilemme.
Si elle essaie de le sauver, elle mettra la famille de Samera en danger. Par
contre, refuser d’aider Xander voudrait dire accepter sa mort. En risquant sa
vie et son intégrité pour sauver celle d’un autre, Amya voit le monde avec une
nouvelle conscience. </p>

</div></div>","HI!   BIENVENU!
First of all, thank you for considering my campaign!
My name is Lydhia Marie. I'm twenty-two and I received my degree in English literature last spring. I am currently moving in a new city and have no job other than write ideas on my keyboard and hope to be able to publish them soon. :)During my last summer at university, I decided to write a novel. Not because I'd had a dream or because I'd always loved writing. I needed to start a new project and decided that I was going to write a story. At first, the idea was quite basic, but as time went and words were thrown on a page, I discovered a passion and the story around my comatose student grew into a brand new world filled with monsters and danger.That's how I fell in love with writing. And that's how I knew that as long as I can write, I can never be bored.I finished writing the novel in two months... I know what you're thinking right now: It was probably really crappy.AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!It was.It really was.BUT the idea behind the poor writing wasn't. At least I and beta readers still don't think so.So after I attended a three-week creative writing course at the University of Oxford in England, I decided to rewrite my novel from top to bottom. And I couldn't even begin to summarize the changes I've made. Actually, just picture Beast in Beauty and the Beast before and mostly after Belle's declaration.
Now that my piece has a nice, handsome face, an interesting core, and a hot and muscular bottom, what should I do with it?That's where I need YOU.Yes, it's a nice dream to publish a novel.And yes, it's a lot of fun to publish your novel on your own, but it does take a little money to do so.

(French translation) Voici le court résumé de mon roman:
           Vous
êtes-vous déjà demandé ce qui influence votre personnalité? Votre humeur? Les
choix que vous faites dans la vie?
  Lorsqu’Amya reprend
conscience à l’hôpital, elle réalise qu’elle est incapable de se réveiller,
mais aussi qu’elle a perdu la mémoire de plus de onze mois de sa vie. À partir
d’information donné par sa famille et ses amis qui viennent la visiter, elle se
souvient graduellement des évènements qui l’ont fait rentrer dans un coma.
Surtout, elle se souvient d’avoir la capacité de Séjourner, de projeter son âme
dans le corps des autres, ainsi que la connaissance des Dimensions.  
  Mais quand Amya trouve finalement
un moyen de se réveiller, elle s’aperçoit que tout ce qui l’entoure est bouleversé.
Sa meilleure amie Samera a besoin de son aide et lui suggère fortement de
reprendre son poste au sein des Protecteurs d’Amani, son copain n’agit plus
comme avant et son ami Xander est victime d’une morsure de Rascal. Un Rascal
étant un être surnaturel qui a l’apparence d’un humain, mais qui doit se
nourrir de l’humanité des gens pour survivre. Certaine que Xander est sur le
point de se transformer en cette créature, Amya se voit face à un grand dilemme.
Si elle essaie de le sauver, elle mettra la famille de Samera en danger. Par
contre, refuser d’aider Xander voudrait dire accepter sa mort. En risquant sa
vie et son intégrité pour sauver celle d’un autre, Amya voit le monde avec une
nouvelle conscience. 

Here's how I plan on using that money.   (Voici ce que je compte faire avec les fonds ramassés)


   If I reach my goal...
First: I'll be able to find a final editor and a cover designer to make my book as irresistible as it should be.
And then, I will use the rest to print paperbacks and hire a marketing company AND eventually someone who sells book rights to other countries.

Inna Mendor, I am almost 25 and I have just set up my own publising project - <b>""Mendorli""</b>. My Master's degree in journalism, which I gained in one of
the best universities of Ukraine, allows me to qualify for analytical thinking
and the ability to formulate my own thoughts and that of others, and several
years of experience in one of the oldest, the largest and the most successful
publishing houses of Ukraine - for the knowledge of publishing business.</p>
<p>Perhaps you rarely come across a <b>problem</b> that I want at
least to begin to solve for myself and for the Ukrainians - when you are unable
to read or fully understand the classics of the world literature, an
indisputable bestseller of the contemporary or a non-fiction breakthrough of
the year for a single reason - <b>lack of translation into your language</b>.</p>
<p>While the global community of publishers is
""hunting"" for the most interesting novelties, the Ukrainian
publishers are able to publish only a modest part of the world literary
heritage.</p>
<p>My country will not come in a number of leaders of
world opinion, until it has no possibility to read.</p>
<p>There will be no intellectual equality in my country, while
only some of the population are able to read Orwell in the original, and the
millions does not know his name.</p>
<p>I, as a former schoolgirl, a former student, present
fully-fledged and responsible member of society, lacked and am lacking the most
essential books - in my native language.</p>
<p><span>The most</span> <span>unfilled, almost intact, but so sought-after niche in the Ukrainian book market is science fiction.</span></p>

<p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Hello, my caring friends and strangers! My name is
Inna Mendor, I am almost 25 and I have just set up my own publising project - ""Mendorli"". My Master's degree in journalism, which I gained in one of
the best universities of Ukraine, allows me to qualify for analytical thinking
and the ability to formulate my own thoughts and that of others, and several
years of experience in one of the oldest, the largest and the most successful
publishing houses of Ukraine - for the knowledge of publishing business.
Perhaps you rarely come across a problem that I want at
least to begin to solve for myself and for the Ukrainians - when you are unable
to read or fully understand the classics of the world literature, an
indisputable bestseller of the contemporary or a non-fiction breakthrough of
the year for a single reason - lack of translation into your language.
While the global community of publishers is
""hunting"" for the most interesting novelties, the Ukrainian
publishers are able to publish only a modest part of the world literary
heritage.
My country will not come in a number of leaders of
world opinion, until it has no possibility to read.
There will be no intellectual equality in my country, while
only some of the population are able to read Orwell in the original, and the
millions does not know his name.
I, as a former schoolgirl, a former student, present
fully-fledged and responsible member of society, lacked and am lacking the most
essential books - in my native language.
The most unfilled, almost intact, but so sought-after niche in the Ukrainian book market is science fiction.
Based on the world rankings, public mood, personal feedback and with determination
to show the Ukrainian audience the best of the
best, I made a list of about 20 books
that will make a good foundation and shape an idea about the world sci-fi.
Among the top priority publications,
the work will be started on in the near future, are:
1. 
Dan
Simmons “Hyperion”, “The Fall of
Hyperion”, “The
Terror”
2. 
Roger Zelazny “The
Chronicles of Amber”,
“Lord of Light”, “Jack of Shadows”
3. 
Frank Herbert “Dune”
4. 
Isaac
Asimov “The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science”, “Exploring the Earth and the
Cosmos”, “The Bicentennial Man”, “Foundation” (trilogy)
5. 
Robert Heinlein “Starship Troopers’, “The Unpleasant Profession of
Jonathan Hoag”, “Stranger in a Strange Land”
6. 
Alfred Elton van Vogt “Slan”
7. 
Stanisław
Lem “The Futorological Congress”
8.  Ursula Le Guin “Hainish Cycle” 
9. 
Philip Dick “The Man in the High Castle”, “Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb”, “A Scanner Darkly”
10. 
Henry Lion Oldie “The Abyss of Hungry Eyes”...
In order to start working on the first three books, I need to:
- 
translate them into
Ukrainian - $ 7,500 for three books;
- 
perform literary editing -
$ 3,750 for three
books;
- 
compose for e-books
and for printing - $ 590 for three books;
- 
prepare the covers and
illustrations - $ 660 for three books.
The books will be distributed electronically on the site of the publishing
house and at specialized areas. If desired, the customer will be able to order
a paper version of the book. This way I plan to avoid the risk of unsold
circulation, the cost of renting a warehouse and logistics.
I undertake acquisition of copyright, marketing campaign, organization of
the website operation and other costs accompanying the workflow.
A team of professional and responsible people is ready
to start working on a fundamentally new publishing project, once you help us to
make the first step. And its price is - $ 12,500.
Although now Ukraine badly needs more material things,
I want to contribute to its development, to do what I can, and like and believe
is my duty. Therefore, I will be grateful to all, who will help to say
important things – in Ukrainian.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>My Story<span><br/></span>
</h3>
<p>I never dreamed that I would write a book ...
until, one day, I realized that what I’d been teaching for so long was needed
in the world - and I had to write it. 

</p>
<p>As an actor, speaker, teacher, Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) and
an introvert, I’ve had a love-hate relationship with the spotlight for most of
my life. At times, everything would flow effortlessly. I’d surrender
to the present moment, find my voice and inspire others.  At other times, I
couldn’t find words.  I couldn’t think or move. Or, when I did
speak, I felt like I was trapped inside of a deranged manikin wanting to
express myself (while being forced to
watch this manikin function in the world as a pale imitation of my true
self.)  One of the worst aspects during this time was that I
didn’t understand what happened in me to create these two vastly
different experiences of using my voice in the world.  So, in my early
thirties, I embarked on a quest to find out how to speak authentically and
powerfully when it mattered most.  As I gathered answers, I formed a
company (<span><u><span>Voice Matters</span></u></span>) and shared them with
others as a coach, leader and teacher. 

</p><p>Over the years, in helping thousands of clients in groups and
one-on-one around the world, I became known as “The Voice Whisperer.”  I helped
to evoke their full creative expression, enabling them to speak from their most
compelling selves when it mattered most.  </p>
<p>With this book, I’m sharing these answers so that those who want
and need them can have them.  This book offers an integrated approach that
will teach you the “how” and “being” of speaking, anytime, anywhere, at the
most profound level.</p>

Thriving is the choice not to let cancer or any illness be the defining thing in a persons life. Thrive recognizes the need for survivors but for the first time those who do not survive are able to shake the implication that they are automatically losers. The survivor label for Gayle was a simple win - lose proposition. If you survive, you are a winner. And while no one would audibly say that people who do not survive are losers, that inference looms over the head of those who are deep in the muck of their cancer battle.
Thrive brings relief of negative stigmas based on simple outcomes. Thrive measures the quality a life has offered as a better instrument of value than assigning value only to the length of that life. 
The Thrive book in concert with the completed documentary and Thrive anthem song are a collection of communication tools that we intend to use to spread the hope that is the Thrive philosophy. 
Our steps are now to raise the funds. The monies raised by this offering are to enable the book to be completed, have a professional editor edit it and complete a first run of publishing. All the Thrive content and images have been copyrighted and trademarked.    Risks & Challenges  
There are very few obstacles left. The Thrive documentary is complete, as is the Thrive anthem song. The monies raised by this offering are to enable the book to be completed, have a professional editor edit it and complete a first run of publishing.

<div>The average age of first exposure to online pornography is ten years old.  Up to 20% of adolescents are sexting.  A recent study revealed that <b>seven year olds</b> are creating sexual videos online.  Most parents have no idea what their children are doing online.  Do you know what your kids are doing in their messaging apps, social networks or online?</div>

<div>This project was born out of my work with adult sex addicts.

They learned about sex from peers and magazines. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In today's digital age, teens are often more tech savvy than their parents.  Digital technology is an integral part of sexual exploration.  Parents need to know what their children are doing in the digital world.  Parents need to know how things like early exposure to pornography or sexting can affect their children in the long term.  Ultimately, parents need to know how to talk intelligently and effectively to their teens about sexuality in the digital age.  </div>

<p><strong>Alex Beene</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Rose Reid</strong> are life-long theatre enthusiasts who met in college and have share their enthusiasm for the arts with each other for nearly a decade. In the fall of 2016, the two began to discuss ways to channel that passion into a project that would share that love for the performing arts with a new generation of learners. They met with the unbelievably talented illustrator <strong>Sarah Newsom</strong> and set into motion a new children's book that would reflect their gratitude to an art form that has given them so much enjoyment.</p>
<p>""Born on Broadway"" is scheduled for a release in Fall 2017. The book is written by Alex Beene with concept assistance by Jennifer Rose Reid and is illustrated by Sarah Newsom. Hilliard Press &amp; Mascot Books will be publishing the book. We're thrilled to announce that one of Broadway's greatest non-profits, Roundabout Theatre Company, will be working as a charity partner on the project and will receive a percentage of each book sale that will go to fund arts education! We're extremely excited about this endeavor and wanted to be able to include our family, friends and really anyone with a passion for the arts in on this project. That's why this funding initiative was launched.</p>
<p>""Born on Broadway"" will be available in over 70 countries through more than 100 retailers, including Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-a-Million, and various bookstores. The book will also be available for digital purchase through Amazon Kindle and iBooks on the iTunes store.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Why we're raising funds &amp; how you're rewarded</strong></p>
<p>The idea for seeking financial backing for this project came not just out of a monetary need to cover publishing and marketing costs. We wanted family, friends and anyone with a love for all things in the performing arts to have the opportunity to contribute to the making of the book and pre-order their copies early. All funds raised will go toward the initial printing and marketing fees associated with the project. This will also assist in making sure additional profits from sales start going to arts education programs through Roundabout more quickly.</p>

Click <a href=""https://goo.gl/INHomV"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a> to access. Enjoy!</p><p>Hi, my name is John Bowie. Welcome to the fundraising campaign for my book! Currently, I have a complete draft of the first book – it just needs a little help to get across the finish line. That’s where you come in!</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>What is the book about?</strong><ul><li>Mini-synopsis: When Aurora discovers an abandoned mining facility near her home in the mountains, she unwittingly activates a rogue machine putting her community in peril. She, her brother Kars and best friend Lena embark on a journey to save their families in pursuit of a mysterious wise man in a world of neural computers and artificial intelligences. The quest takes them from their backwater village to a city of technological miracles and futuristic threats, while forcing Aurora to confront her own mysterious past.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>​<strong>Why did I write it?</strong><ul>
<li>I am inspired by books with sprawling adventure, stories I have enjoyed throughout my life such as Dune, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter. These are stories that create robust worlds full of wonder and mystery - worlds in which I would want to take part. I wanted to write a story that creates such a world for others to explore, and share in the mysteries and moments of awe.</li>
<li>I created an adventure that explores pressing philosophical questions about technology with the mythic experience of The Hero’s Journey. My goal is to create a universe that captures the essential magic of our relationship with technology that is accessible to the reader through mystery and wonder.</li>

<strong>Perks for Donors</strong><ul><li>Perks for donors include eBooks, signed copies, clothing, and more. See the Perk Section for more information.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>What your contributions will help achieve:</strong><ul>
<li>Campaign contributors can expect to receive a publication-ready version of book one within six months, although I hope this will be even sooner.</li>
<li>I hope that initial contributions will spark sustained growth for the entire series (book two is already well in the works). I also envision opportunity for a wide variety of other media (and cinematic!) offerings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The Campaign and Why it is Important to Me</strong><ul>
<li>To give some personal background, I have JD in environmental law with an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a master’s in Jungian psychology – the study of dreams, myths, and analysis. I am new to writing fiction, but this story has been in the works for a long time. I am working on a series of books that explores themes of technology, consciousness, dreams, and memory; all while telling a really exciting story!​</li>
<li>I set-up this campaign to begin sharing this story, and to hopefully raise the startup costs to bring book one to publication. The manuscript of the first book in the series is complete and awaiting professional editing. The campaign is designed to raise funds for the cost of editing, book art, and other incidental costs incurred in taking this book from draft to publication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Funding Breakdown</strong><ul>
<li>Editorial work ($3000) – I have had preliminary meetings with an extremely experienced editor (&gt;15 years experience). She has reviewed a portion of my manuscript and is eager to work on this project with me. I feel certain that she will help refine the manuscript and help me bring it from draft to published product.</li>
<li>Graphic and Art ($2000) – I would like to approach the publishing process with high quality concept art and graphics to support the highly visual story and also to demonstrate the potential for other media and formats.</li>
<li>Filings ($500) – Provisional copyrights have been filed, final copyrights are an additional cost.</li>
<li>Incidentals ($500) – printing, postage, and entry fees.<ul></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Where the funds go if we don’t reach the entire goal.</strong><ul>
<li>If I am unable to raise the full amount, whatever has been raised will go towards the professional editing process. Once the manuscript has gone through editing, I will pursue the formal publishing process (hopefully through an agent to a major publisher). Professional editing is the current difference between a complete draft and a finished book.</li>
<li>If there are additional funds beyond those requested…Thank you! I would devote additional funds toward the early stage development of a multimedia platform and editing of book two in the series (draft in the works).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>Value of the Project to the Contributor and the World</strong><ul>
<li><p>As an avid science fiction reader throughout my life, I truly understand the magic and joy that such writing can bring. I wrote a story embracing both the real/current and the future/magical. It is laden with ideas from great conversations with friends and mentors in my own life. To me, one of the great beauties of fiction and science fiction is that we can collectively engage with ideas, ‘live with them for a while,’ and feel out how we want to proceed.</p></li>
<li><p>The world needs more stories!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Experience</strong><ul><li>I am new to fiction writing, but have been writing throughout my life – everything from whimsical mythic stories to succinct legal documents. Hopefully there is some of all of this in there.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The world of traditional publishing presents challenges for a new writer. Some publishers require manuscripts to be submitted through an agent before they will even look at the content. The gatekeepers of agents and publishers can potentially keep a manuscript from publication. Self-publishing does not have gatekeepers. While this has generally opened the field to new authors, it also created a vast ocean of content that can be difficult for readers to navigate. In short, a risk of self-publishing is that the book could be lost in the shuffle!</li>
<li>I aim to pursue the traditional publishing route if possible and have some good connections to make this happen. Professional editing is certainly the first step in getting there.</li>
<li>People liking the book – I have had a small group of friends and family read and critique the book thus far, and have made improvements based on their comments. All that being said, I will continue to listen to my readers and revise!</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>Even if you do not donate, there are several ways that you can help my project to completion.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Read</strong> – One way or another, I will publish this book. When it’s finished, pick up a copy, read it, think about it, talk about it, share it with others!</li>
<li>
<strong>Share</strong> - It’s not all about contributions! Please share this campaign with your friends and communities so that it can see the light of day! A bigger following will help with every aspect of publishing and development.</li>

</div></div>","My name is Dantan Balaram if you dont already know me. Batch of 2004. 
This is a dream for me and I may need your help getting it done. My intent is to gather stories from school and from every generation going back to to 50s if possible. I'd like to publish a book with all our fondest memories from every generation. I will take the effort of collating it but I may need assistance publishing it. I am absolutely sure you will enjoy the read.  
  I am a passionate writer and a proud Homes boy. I know I have what it takes to reach out to people, collate and write stories from and about our beloved Homes. What I do need is assistance publishing this book.  The perks are that you will be a part of this dream of mine and I'm sure you're going to love it as much as I do This is a pure non-profit venture of mine. If I do get to publishing this book, which will be awesome, the funds collected will go to the school . It at all I cannot make it but I have collected funds, it will still go to the school. So, ideally a win-win for our school. 

  I'm sure this will be a part of our lives as we scatter around the globe. These wont just be my stories and memories, it'll be Ours. 

  It a time consuming and a tough task. I am however sure we can make it. 
My plan is to reach out to as many people as I can and have them contribute to making this successful.      Its alright if you cannot contribute; please however do help spread the word so someone else can do so :) 

Much appreciated.

You, a woman, starring from creation<br/>

In spectacular scenes, frame by frame<br/>

Birthed the world, and preserve it<br/></p>

During the first nine months of filming<br/>

Sometimes insecure in your peculiar role<br/>

In short memorable lines<br/>

Consisting of lovely laughter and cries<br/>

These are the essence of your drama<br/></p>

Is the magic of being a mother<br/>

Pregnancy transformed you, darling<br/>

Into a celebrated ‘super-shero’ of all time<br/></p>

For your child you will lift up the skies<br/>

Awake through many difficult nights<br/>

You keep the world warm for us all<br/></p>
<p>Mother’s altruism is without limit<br/>

So touching and truly inspirational<br/>

Maternal dramas are the purest art<br/>

Fed with devotion from sincere love<br/></p>

Poetry now paints your role in words<br/>

Eulogies and inspirations to extol you<br/>

For your strong dedication to purpose<br/></p>

You're the star of a universal movie

The acting is pure from the heart

With soundtrack of baby laughter
The plot is simple and old as time

You, a woman, starring from creation

In spectacular scenes, frame by frame

Birthed the world, and preserve it
Oh, how wonderful you are, woman

During the first nine months of filming

Sometimes insecure in your peculiar role

But always a glowing wonderful star
Countless characters tell your story

In short memorable lines

Consisting of lovely laughter and cries

These are the essence of your drama
Sequel to your blooming womanhood

Is the magic of being a mother

Pregnancy transformed you, darling

Into a celebrated ‘super-shero’ of all time
With your female bravery and strength

For your child you will lift up the skies

Awake through many difficult nights

You keep the world warm for us all
Mother’s altruism is without limit

So touching and truly inspirational

Maternal dramas are the purest art

Fed with devotion from sincere love
For all your struggles and heroic acts

Poetry now paints your role in words

Eulogies and inspirations to extol you

For your strong dedication to purpose
This pregnancy gift book is dedicated to every woman worldwide, especially those who are trying to conceive, pregnant and parenting.
WHY PREGNANCY POEMS
COLLECTION?
One of the most thoughtful
ways to identify with anyone going through pregnancy experience is to give
care, love and support, and poems make for a unique
gift of inspiration.
Whether it’s your wife,
daughter, son, sister, brother, parent, aunt, friend, acquaintance or anyone
else that’s on a pregnancy journey, this book provides you with the
inspirational pregnancy poems that will touch that expecting person’s heart.
Poems are helpful to convey
specialized messages of care, hope and motivation during pregnancy but there is a common problem. 

Poem writing is a daunting task
for many people. And this book perfectly solves this problem!

If
I may ask,


Do you
have anyone around you right now, who is pregnant or trying to conceive?


Have you ever needed the perfect
pregnancy poems for yourself, or to send any pregnant woman or expecting dad?


Have you
ever been short of words, or found it difficult to write up an inspiring poem
for your friend or loved one who’s going to have a baby?


Have you
ever thought of learning about pregnancy experience in a practically inspiring
way?


If YES, then this Book Is A Perfect Solution for You. 

From childhood, I’ve had a strong passion for the wonderful experience of pregnancy and the burden of motherhood.  Eventually, I was able to give expression to my passion by creating a pregnancy information website, Pregnancy-Mama.com, which attracts visitors from over 110 countries.Surprisingly, I discovered over sixty percent of the visitors’ traffic at PregnancyMama centres on pregnancy poems.  Many visitors daily search for pregnancy poems to soothe the soul, inspire and warm the heart.Although I’ve freely provided poems on my site, increasing queries from website visitors made a compelling case for this book - expected to contain over 200 premium pregnancy poems that are perfect for different experiences of trying to conceive and being pregnant.WHAT TYPES OF PREGNANCY POEM WILL YOU FIND IN THIS COLLECTION?

You’ll find inspirational poems that convey diverse
experiences; outpouring joys, about the typical ups and downs of pregnancy –

“I wanted to show my
beautiful wife how happy I am about our first pregnancy. My wife likes poetry,
so when I came across your pregnancy poems ebook. I knew it’s a perfect gift
for her, and I was right.”  – Joe
Anderson“Initially I was
skeptical whether I would find the ideal poem to send my pregnant daughter who
has decided to be a single mother. I got your ebook and I found it helpful. My
daughter called to thank me for the poem I sent to assure her she’s not alone.”
- Margret Riley“My best  friend had trouble conceiving so when she
found out she was pregnant with twins and broke the news to me, I wanted to
celebrate with her and this book  was my
starting gift for her – I needed something inspiring that she would enjoy
throughout pregnancy.” Lee Ann ConnorsI got pregnant and
wanted to break the news with a poem. This poem of a thing – poor me, I
couldn’t put the poem together. I searched Google and found pregnancy-mama.com and
then, I got a superb pregnancy announcement poem that I used in there.” -

<h3>Brief review                                        <i>En español abajo</i>
</h3>
<p>We need $110,000 to buy a house, which will be the headquarters of the foundation and allows to better serve the beneficiaries of the program.</p>
<p>At the home or headquarters, we setup training for workshops and therapeutics.</p>
<p>In reality, we count on the equipment, supplies, and tools for workshops of crafts and manufacturing.</p>
<p>However, they are located in the homes of volunteers or patients who have borrowed the space.<br/>We have workshops for handmade chocolate. Articles in cloth towels for kitchens and bathrooms, workshops for bow boxes and workshops for packaging and pajamas.</p>
<p>In the therapeutic field we have sewing workshops, painting on wood, pottery and canvas, and watermark paper. All these focus on retrieving functions that are lost to the disease.</p>
<p>With the money raised, we would purchase four desks, 24 chairs and 20 mats. Along with that we must do two home modifications; build a bathroom for the disabled, and an elevator for wheelchairs.</p>
<p>- <b>Tell people about our exclusive rewards. Make them excited!</b></p>
<p> At the close of the campaign, we will be giving away five art works to the highest donations we receive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3 highest contribution will receive a Taino art work made by patients, 70 cm x 60 cm</p>

<p> If we fail to reach our goal, the money will be invested in leasing a space to set up productive workshops for 3 or 6 months, as these are more expensive than the therapeutic workshops because of the high energy consumption. In addition, we must continually move machines to the space they are lending us.</p>
<p> Occupational workshops for psychology and physical therapy will continue to provide for the social halls and homes that facilitate a space.</p>

your campaign in great detail and tell people the difference their contribution
will make:</i></p>
<p> Most of the beneficiaries of the program have
no pension, and the physical limitations no longer allow them to work. With
their contribution, it will help these people to generate money with the
products they manufacture and the foundation helps them to market them.</p>
<p> In my city, there are more than 2,000 people
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but this disease is uncommon in
Colombia.  So it is classified as a rare
disease, which means that there is little help for those who have the diagnosis.
Your support will help grow and strengthen the foundation of the program.</p>
<p> The foundation works a comprehensive
rehabilitation program, physical rehabilitation, psycho-emotional
rehabilitation with emphasis on social and family inclusion, and legal support
in the areas of pension and job relocation.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p><i>People appreciate your
transparency. Be open and make your mark by providing perspectives on the risks
and obstacles you may face on the way to achieve your goal.</i></p>
<p>• A
challenge we are working on is the patients wanting the headquarters of the
foundation near their homes. The psychologist has developed working group
activities highlighting the benefits that the foundation has its own
headquarters.</p>
<p>•
Another obstacle is the difficulty disabled patients face, especially those
with wheelchairs and canes. A solution for this was the sponsorship of the
company, ANDISEG Ltda., who pledged to provide money for the transfer of
patients. This company will begin to transport once the headquarters is
running.</p>
<p>• Another
serious obstacle is not getting a location with multiple access/streets. To overcome
this obstacle, once we have the money, we’ll tour five blocks to the north,
south east and west of the location wanted for the house, which needs to be crossed
by two important streets and easily accessible avenues.</p>

We need $110,000 to buy a house, which will be the headquarters of the foundation and allows to better serve the beneficiaries of the program.
At the home or headquarters, we setup training for workshops and therapeutics.
In reality, we count on the equipment, supplies, and tools for workshops of crafts and manufacturing.
However, they are located in the homes of volunteers or patients who have borrowed the space.We have workshops for handmade chocolate. Articles in cloth towels for kitchens and bathrooms, workshops for bow boxes and workshops for packaging and pajamas.
In the therapeutic field we have sewing workshops, painting on wood, pottery and canvas, and watermark paper. All these focus on retrieving functions that are lost to the disease.
With the money raised, we would purchase four desks, 24 chairs and 20 mats. Along with that we must do two home modifications; build a bathroom for the disabled, and an elevator for wheelchairs.
- Tell people about our exclusive rewards. Make them excited!
 At the close of the campaign, we will be giving away five art works to the highest donations we receive.

3 highest contribution will receive a Taino art work made by patients, 70 cm x 60 cm
 
 The works are made by the patients, Arte TAINO, in patina and acrylic paint on alterpiece, 70 cm x 60 cm.
whoever donates de $1.000 USD, are welcomed to inaguration, and all expenses will be added to your account.
Other Rewards

      


- Describe where the funds go if we fail to reach overall goal.
 If we fail to reach our goal, the money will be invested in leasing a space to set up productive workshops for 3 or 6 months, as these are more expensive than the therapeutic workshops because of the high energy consumption. In addition, we must continually move machines to the space they are lending us.
 Occupational workshops for psychology and physical therapy will continue to provide for the social halls and homes that facilitate a space.
 
- 

The impact


 Explain
your campaign in great detail and tell people the difference their contribution
will make:
 Most of the beneficiaries of the program have
no pension, and the physical limitations no longer allow them to work. With
their contribution, it will help these people to generate money with the
products they manufacture and the foundation helps them to market them.
 In my city, there are more than 2,000 people
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but this disease is uncommon in
Colombia.  So it is classified as a rare
disease, which means that there is little help for those who have the diagnosis.
Your support will help grow and strengthen the foundation of the program.
 The foundation works a comprehensive
rehabilitation program, physical rehabilitation, psycho-emotional
rehabilitation with emphasis on social and family inclusion, and legal support
in the areas of pension and job relocation.
- 
Risks and Challenges
People appreciate your
transparency. Be open and make your mark by providing perspectives on the risks
and obstacles you may face on the way to achieve your goal.
• A
challenge we are working on is the patients wanting the headquarters of the
foundation near their homes. The psychologist has developed working group
activities highlighting the benefits that the foundation has its own
headquarters.
•
Another obstacle is the difficulty disabled patients face, especially those
with wheelchairs and canes. A solution for this was the sponsorship of the
company, ANDISEG Ltda., who pledged to provide money for the transfer of
patients. This company will begin to transport once the headquarters is
running.
• Another
serious obstacle is not getting a location with multiple access/streets. To overcome
this obstacle, once we have the money, we’ll tour five blocks to the north,
south east and west of the location wanted for the house, which needs to be crossed
by two important streets and easily accessible avenues.

-  Other ways you can help

For those who can’t help, we ask you to spread the campaign in their
social networks using tools
Indiegogo.

</p><p>
</p><p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b></p><p>Why should you contribute? If you care
about the advancement of academia then keep reading and contribute to our
cause. There aren’t many international student law reviews that bring together
students from across the globe to contribute to legal scholarship. We intend to
use the commonalities that exist between different jurisdictions to build a
body of work that critically analyses the law that exists, and to contribute to
its growth and development in a socially desirable way.</p>
<p>It is true that running a law review is
comprised of mainly individuals volunteering their time. We do however need to
cover website maintenance and start up costs since The International Student
Law Review is not currently associated with any University or with any
institution. Here’s the planned breakdown of our costs:</p>
<p>Hosting by Wix is approximately £5 a
month. This means that for an operational period of two years, we would need at
least £120. We intend to use all remaining funds to help increase our audience through social media, which begin at £3 per day for Facebook's promotion tool.</p>
<p>We intend for TISLR to grow over time,
(hopefully it will grow faster than we can handle!!) and we believe that this
is a realistic timeframe to establish a sufficient readership and support to
obtain sponsorship from an organization to cover website and other operational
costs.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. With your
support we will be able to keep our website online whilst we develop a core
audience and build rapport with various institutions, and you will be directly
helping law students make a difference in the world of academia.</p>
<p><b><i>What do you get?</i></b></p>
<p>For a donation of £2 - £5  your name will
be listed on our website as a contributor, with our undying gratitude.</p>
<p>For a donation of £5+ your name
will be listed on our website, along with a link to your organization, group,
or social media page of choice, along with our gratitude. </p>
<p>*All contributors will be linked to the page once it is published.</p><p>However, all is not lost if we do not
reach our goal. Any contribution, however small, will go a long way in helping
keep TISLR running. </p>
<p><b><i>Why a law review? </i></b></p>
<p>As law students the development of the
law in a manner that is socially responsible and desirable is a cause that has
grown and remains close to our hearts.</p>
<p>However law reviews are not only for
students. Quite often when judges are making their decisions, they will refer
to the various bodies of academic scholarship that might exist regarding a
particular issue. For example, in the UK Supreme Court decision in <i>Jones v Kernott </i>[2011] UKSC 53 the Court
considered academic comment in determining the most appropriate way to
calculate a spouse’s beneficial interest in a jointly owned property. It served
to clarify the position of spouses, following a divorce, relating to their
entitlement to a property given the extent of their contributions to it.</p>
<p>It is our hope that in time work from our
law review will aid in developing the law for the better to more effectively
serve the interests of the people who are governed by it. By contributing to
this cause, you will ensure that we have the opportunity to assist in developing
the law in this way.</p>
<p><b><i>Our experience:</i></b></p>
<p>The ISLR has two Editors in Chief. Our
first, Michael Testori has a history of working in a variety of challenging
situations in law firms both onshore and off shore. By working in various
capacities he has built the vital management experience to work effectively
with teams and to manage various responsibilities. Our second Editor in Chief,
Andre Sinanan, has equally a broad range of experience, albeit with smaller
firms. He has previously served as the Executive Editor of the Kent Student Law
Review which provided the necessary introduction and experience to how law
reviews operate and the challenges in successfully operating a law review. His
experience working with a pro bono law clinic has allowed him to effectively
work in a team and manage key responsibilities both to other workers and the
clients whom he served. </p>
<p>We recognize that it won’t be an easy
road. We have to build a base of submissions to have something to publish, and
then build our readership. However to face these difficulties, we have
recruited some of the best candidates we could find from universities
throughout the United Kingdom. Together we have over 5 years experience in
senior law review positions, which means we know how to best operate TISLR.</p>
<p>Presently we have editors who are in the
process of and have trained as solicitors, barristers and academics. We believe
that we are highly capable of producing an extremely high quality journal if we
can obtain adequate funding for the first few years.</p>
<p>We have begun taking on staff writers,
analytical minds who will be regularly contributing to legal blogs, by
considering the developments in the law and considering the impact that these
decisions will have. </p>
<p>To ensure that we create our base of
submissions and readership we will utilize our contacts throughout the UK, and
indeed in quite a few other countries. By doing this we can ensure that we will
receive the highest caliber of submissions available and will in turn contribute
to the extent of our readership.</p>

So when the intense storm hits <i>after</i> the mission and you don't have a letter from a prophet to tell you that God called you to this, where do you find strength to push through? How do you discover what your unique life mission is now? What is your personal mission in life after the mission ends? How do you find it? That is what <i>Live Your Mission</i> is all about.</p><p>Every single returned missionary has a unique mission to accomplish after their full-time mission. <i>You</i> have a unique life mission. Something that <i>only you</i> can accomplish. Something that <i>only you</i> can create. Something that never existed before. Until you find it, you will be living with uncertainty about why you do what you do everyday. However, once you do find it, <i>everything</i> changes and the world is a better place because <i>you</i> exist. </p><h3>LIVE YOUR MISSION: 21 Powerful Principles to Discover Your Life Mission After Your Mission</h3><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434401179/g6xv7nkniug576l81new.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 459.180887372014px; height: 651px;""/></p></div><p>Live Your Mission is a book for returned missionaries (and anyone) who wants to discover their personal life mission, after their full-time mission.

<h3> </h3>Portugués y Espanhol (con el vídeo allá abajo en español). <br/>Ìndice - apresentação do livro (presentación del libro)- questões técnicas (cuestiones técnicas).<br/> <br/>Sobre  a gente. Sobre nosotros. <br/>  <p><strong>apresentação do livro: grandes feitos em personagens da cidade. </strong></p>
<p> Quando a chuva chega nos sentimos tranquilos, nos apaziguamos, a chuva leva feridas, ou não, apenas nos lembra os sentidos desfeitos, a busca por algo que não encontramos. A chuva em duas grandes cidades gigantes, em dois monstros de carros, de pedras em cima de pedras que formam desenhos arquitetônicos, aqui é onde a chuva cai, na Cidade do México e São Paulo que foram construídas por mundos distintos, entretanto, muito semelhantes em sonhos.</p>
<p> Quem é construído? Construímos nós a cidade, ou ela a gente? Quem somos nós? Parece que quando a chuva cai nestes monstros que  que dominan seus construtores, é onde nasce as perguntas: Que queremos? Que fazer? Outro dia para viver ou para morrer? </p>
<p> Quando a chuva chega é uma série de contos em que se expressam personagens que constroem sentidos para suas vidas, ao mesmo tempo, constroem os sentidos destas duas grandes cidades, Cidade do México e São Paulo, e são desconstruídos por ela, se explodem como bolhas de efemérides. Quando a chuva chega é a sensibilidade da realidade social e o irreal da vida na cidade que se despedaça. </p>
<p>Está composto,, por tanto, de 5 partes (1 urbe encantada, 2) urbe desencantada; 3) anti-urbe; 4) urbe feita pedaços; 5) urbe reencantada). Neste projeto queremos contar com a ajuda de vocês para financiar a primeira parte, a Urbe encantada (bilingue, português e espanhol) onde nossos personagens encontram o encanto em meio ao caos.</p>
<p> O narrador se apresenta como consciência (super-ego) dos personagens, então, quando dizemos, você fez, é para por o narrador falando com o próprio personagem (será que não haveria algo dos personagens no leitor?). Às vezes é apenas a consciência sem pontos, com repetições, com “simm e nãooo” longos, como se estivéssemos pensando. Pois é um livro reflexivo e psicológico, onde os personagens sentem como a cidade se expressa neles. Para mim a cidade expressa um desafio e para você? Qual é o teu desafio? A cada conto você vai se sentindo mais familiarizado e fluido com os personagens e suas consciências que enfrentam sua Cidade. </p>
<p> A menina ama e quer ser amada e luta por dar sentido a sua beleza e a chuva chega e traz lembranças de quem é, de como caminha na cidade e busca prazeres enquanto sofre com o racismo. Esta mesma chuva chega ao menino na periferia de São Paulo, a delirar sobre seus sonhos de ser jogador de futebol. Ela também traz ao menino cego a potência do mundo que pulsa nas festas dos mariachis, ela chega e traz o sentimento de pecado ao ex-seminarista com câncer. </p>
<p>Ela ensina o que pulsa por trás do ferro cantante da máquina que grita na estação da Sé, na estação do metro Tláhuac. Ela ajuda na construção de sentido destas formigas estressadas que correm na 25 de março e na Merced. Como recomeçar? </p>
<p> Com vocês, nossos personagens de Cuando la lluvia llega. </p>
<p><strong>Questões técnicas: é um livro de contos a preço de apoio</strong></p>
<p>Primeiro, gente, é um livro de contos, não de poesia. Também sou poeta, e tenho em mente outro poemário, mas este é um livro de prosa com 11 contos, são 140 páginas, bilingue, com gravuras ilustrações originais de Luísa Melo.</p>
<p>Você pode ter o livro com o preço de 200 pesos (como R$ 40,00 reais, o cambio de peso tem o preço médio de 5 pesos por real), ou além do livro outras lembranças (recompensas) que podem ver no tópico recompensa. Imagine ter um original da ilustração num quadro. </p>
<p>Lembrando, o preço de 200 pesos é pensando o livro mais o apoio para difusão. </p>
<p>- sobre os 23 mil (como 4 mil reais): Pensa na impressão dos livros e na viabilização técnica de distribuição e difusão. </p>
<p>- se você tiver dificuldade em apoiar diretamente por aqui, fale com a gente, mas é importante apoiar por aqui, pois é tudo ou nada, se não alcançamos os 23 mil, eles devolvem o dinheiro. Minha escolha deste meio é a possibilidade de maior divulgação transnacional. </p>

<p><strong>presentación del libro: grandes hechos de personajes en la ciudad </strong></p>
<p>“Cuando la lluvia llega” nos sentimos tranquilos, nos desquitamos del odio, la lluvia lleva nuestras heridas, o no, o sólo nos recuerda los sentidos deshechos, la búsqueda por algo que no encontramos. La lluvia en dos ciudades gigantes, en dos monstruos de carros, de piedras encima de piedras que forman dibujos arquitectónicos, acá es donde la lluvia cae, en Ciudad de México y São Paulo que fueron construidas por mundos distintos, sin embargo, muy semejantes en sueños.  </p>
<p>¿Quiénes son construidos? ¿Construimos nosotros a la ciudad, o ella a nosotros? ¿Quiénes somos nosotros? Parece que cuando la lluvia cae en esos monstruos que dominan sus constructores, es donde nace los cuestionamientos: </p>
<p>“¿Qué queremos? ¿Qué hacer? ¿Otro día para vivir o para morir?</p>
<p> Cuando la lluvia llega es una serie de cuentos en lo que se expresa personajes que construyen sentidos para sus vidas, y al mismo tiempo, construyen los sentidos de esas dos grandes ciudades, Ciudad de México y São Paulo, y son de-construidos por ella, se explotan como burbujas de efemérides. </p>
<p>Cuando la lluvia llega es la sensibilidad de la realidad social y lo irreal de la vida en la ciudad que se despedaza. Está compuesto por ende de 4 partes (1) urbe encantada; 2) urbe desencantada; 3) Anti-urbe; 4) Urbe hecha pedazos; 5) urbe re-encantada).</p>
<p>En ese proyecto queremos contar con la ayuda de ustedes para financiar la primera parte, la “Urbe encantada” (bilingüe, portugués y español) donde nuestros personajes encuentran el encanto en medio del caos. El narrador se presenta como conciencia (súper-yo) de los personajes, entonces, cuando decimos, “tú has hecho”, es para poner el narrador hablando con el propio personaje (¿será que no habría algo de los personajes en el lector?). </p>
<p>A las veces es apenas la conciencia sin puntos, con repeticiones, con “sí y noooo” alargados, como si estuviéramos pensando. Pues es un libro reflexivo y psicológico, donde los personajes sienten como la ciudad se expresa en ellos. Para mí la ciudad expresa un desafío y ¿para ti? ¿Cuál es tu desafío? </p>
<p>A cada cuento vas a sintiéndote más familiarizado y fluido con los personajes y sus conciencias que enfrentan su Ciudad. La niña ama y quiere ser amada y lucha por dar sentido a su belleza y la lluvia llega y le trae recuerdos de quién es, de cómo camina en la ciudad y busca placeres mientras sufre con la ciudad de los racismos.</p>
<p> Esa misma lluvia lleva al niño en la periferia de São Paulo, a delirar sobre sus sueños de jugador. Ella también trae al niño ciego la potencia del mundo que pulsa en las fiestas de los mariachis, ella llega y trae el sentimiento de pecado al ex-seminarista con cáncer. Ella enseña lo que pulsa por detrás del hierro cantante de la máquina que grita en la estación de la Sé, en la estación del metro de Tláhuac. </p>

<p>Cuestiones técnicas: es un libro de cuentos a precio de apoyo. </p>

También soy poeta y tengo pensado hacer otro poemario, pero es un libro de prosa con 11 cuentos, son cerca 140 páginas, bilingue, con dibujos originales de Luísa Melo. Puedes tener un libro con el precio de 200 pesos, o además del libro, hay otros recuerdos que pueden ver en ""recompensas"".

</div></div>","Portugués y Espanhol (con el vídeo allá abajo en español). Ìndice - apresentação do livro (presentación del libro)- questões técnicas (cuestiones técnicas). Sobre  a gente. Sobre nosotros.   apresentação do livro: grandes feitos em personagens da cidade. 
 Quando a chuva chega nos sentimos tranquilos, nos apaziguamos, a chuva leva feridas, ou não, apenas nos lembra os sentidos desfeitos, a busca por algo que não encontramos. A chuva em duas grandes cidades gigantes, em dois monstros de carros, de pedras em cima de pedras que formam desenhos arquitetônicos, aqui é onde a chuva cai, na Cidade do México e São Paulo que foram construídas por mundos distintos, entretanto, muito semelhantes em sonhos.
 Quem é construído? Construímos nós a cidade, ou ela a gente? Quem somos nós? Parece que quando a chuva cai nestes monstros que  que dominan seus construtores, é onde nasce as perguntas: Que queremos? Que fazer? Outro dia para viver ou para morrer? 
 Quando a chuva chega é uma série de contos em que se expressam personagens que constroem sentidos para suas vidas, ao mesmo tempo, constroem os sentidos destas duas grandes cidades, Cidade do México e São Paulo, e são desconstruídos por ela, se explodem como bolhas de efemérides. Quando a chuva chega é a sensibilidade da realidade social e o irreal da vida na cidade que se despedaça. 
Está composto,, por tanto, de 5 partes (1 urbe encantada, 2) urbe desencantada; 3) anti-urbe; 4) urbe feita pedaços; 5) urbe reencantada). Neste projeto queremos contar com a ajuda de vocês para financiar a primeira parte, a Urbe encantada (bilingue, português e espanhol) onde nossos personagens encontram o encanto em meio ao caos.
 O narrador se apresenta como consciência (super-ego) dos personagens, então, quando dizemos, você fez, é para por o narrador falando com o próprio personagem (será que não haveria algo dos personagens no leitor?). Às vezes é apenas a consciência sem pontos, com repetições, com “simm e nãooo” longos, como se estivéssemos pensando. Pois é um livro reflexivo e psicológico, onde os personagens sentem como a cidade se expressa neles. Para mim a cidade expressa um desafio e para você? Qual é o teu desafio? A cada conto você vai se sentindo mais familiarizado e fluido com os personagens e suas consciências que enfrentam sua Cidade. 
 A menina ama e quer ser amada e luta por dar sentido a sua beleza e a chuva chega e traz lembranças de quem é, de como caminha na cidade e busca prazeres enquanto sofre com o racismo. Esta mesma chuva chega ao menino na periferia de São Paulo, a delirar sobre seus sonhos de ser jogador de futebol. Ela também traz ao menino cego a potência do mundo que pulsa nas festas dos mariachis, ela chega e traz o sentimento de pecado ao ex-seminarista com câncer. 
Ela ensina o que pulsa por trás do ferro cantante da máquina que grita na estação da Sé, na estação do metro Tláhuac. Ela ajuda na construção de sentido destas formigas estressadas que correm na 25 de março e na Merced. Como recomeçar? 
 Com vocês, nossos personagens de Cuando la lluvia llega. 
Questões técnicas: é um livro de contos a preço de apoio
Primeiro, gente, é um livro de contos, não de poesia. Também sou poeta, e tenho em mente outro poemário, mas este é um livro de prosa com 11 contos, são 140 páginas, bilingue, com gravuras ilustrações originais de Luísa Melo.
Você pode ter o livro com o preço de 200 pesos (como R$ 40,00 reais, o cambio de peso tem o preço médio de 5 pesos por real), ou além do livro outras lembranças (recompensas) que podem ver no tópico recompensa. Imagine ter um original da ilustração num quadro. 
Lembrando, o preço de 200 pesos é pensando o livro mais o apoio para difusão. 
- sobre os 23 mil (como 4 mil reais): Pensa na impressão dos livros e na viabilização técnica de distribuição e difusão.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In 2012 the Institute for Hermetic Studies began holding seminars and making recordings of their teachings available to those who were unable to attend in person.  Along with the recording, Study Guides were also made available to allow better comprehension and application of the teachings.  By 2016 over forty hours of high quality, specialized esoteric teachings were posted to the Institute for Hermetic Studies YouTube Channel, where anyone with internet access could begin to progressively make their way through them.  In the Spring of 2016 the Institute for Hermetic Studies raised over $3,000 (127% of its stated goal) to produce <i>Words of My Teachers</i>, a companion guide to the IHS Audio Programs.  <i>Words of My Teachers </i>contains all of the handouts originally provided in a single comprehensive fashion, taking the student step-by-step through the teachings.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Why It Is Needed</h2>
<p>However, the audio programs vary in sound quality, and with any live teaching, certain areas of discussion contain language that is contextual.  As such, in February 2017 we published the first of several volumes containing the complete edited, annotated, and corrected transcripts from the series, <i>Unfolding the Rose : Illumination and Western Esotericism</i>.  In July 2017 a second published transcript was added, <i>Mind of Hermes: Illumination and Western Esotericism</i>, followed by <i>Pathology of the Sublime: Problems &amp; Solutions on the Spiritual Journey </i>in early August. One additional transcript is under production for publishing before the end of the year.</p>

<p><i>Mind of Hermes: Visionary Experiences in Western Esotericism</i></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1548719218/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499805183&amp;sr=8-22&amp;keywords=Mark+Stavish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1548719218/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1499805183&amp;sr=8-22&amp;keywords=Mark+Stavish</a></p>
<p><i>Pathology of the Sublime: Problems and Solutions on the Spiritual Journey</i></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/1974225577/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501857977&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Mark+Stavish+pathology+of+the+sublime"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1974225577/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501857977&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Mark+Stavish+pathology+of+the+sublime</a></p>
<p>            Transcripts of the programs were provided by volunteers. As the work involved proved both tedious and demanding, many of those who volunteered dropped out before its completion. Our gratitude goes out to those few individuals who completed their assignments; however, it became clear that -- for most of them -- this was not the sort of project they would like to work on again.  Therefore, to complete the publishing of the entire audio series in a timely manner, we needed to look for something other than volunteers to provide the transcripts for editing and annotating.  To accomplish this it was suggested that we utilize a professional transcription service.  After doing our research several possible providers were located and samples of their work obtained.</p>
<p>            To complete the publishing of all teachings contained in the IHS Audio Programs before the end of 2018, the Institute for Hermetic Studies is seeking to raise $5,000 to pay for professional transcription of the remaining programs, editing, proofreading, fundraising platform fees, and donor perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following titles in the series are available:</p>
<p><i>Words of My Teachers</i></p>
<p><i>Meditation and Rituals</i></p>
<p><i>Liturgy of Hermes:  In Praise of the Lord of Light</i></p>
<p><i>Unfolding the Rose: Illumination and Western Esotericism</i></p>
<p><i>Mind of Hermes:  Visionary Experiences and Western Esotericism</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following will be released before the end of 2017:</p>
<p><i>Sanctus: Spirituality in Daily Life &amp; The Secret Fire</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To be completed are:</p>
<p><i>Oral Commentary on Lucid Dreaming, Astral Projection, and the Body of Light</i></p>
<p><i>Inner Alchemy and Magic: Physical Rejuvenation and Psychic Illumination</i></p>
<p><i>Ritual Purification, Exorcism, and Defensive Magic</i></p>
<p><i>Pow-Wow: Traditional Germanic Folk and Grimoire Magic</i></p>
<p><i>Jupiter in Daily Life: Practices for Health, Wealth, Wisdom and Bliss</i><br/> </p>
<p>This is a tremendous amount of work, in truth, it requires more funding than what we are asking for.  If you have not done so already, I encourage you to listen to one of our Audio Programs as well as to read <i>Words of My Teachers </i>along alongside <em>Unfolding the Rose,</em> <i>Mind of Hermes </i>, and <i>Pathology of the Sublime </i>to see for yourself the quality and effectiveness of these teachings and our publishing projects. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What Makes This Unique</h2>

</div></div>","Introduction
In 2012 the Institute for Hermetic Studies began holding seminars and making recordings of their teachings available to those who were unable to attend in person.  Along with the recording, Study Guides were also made available to allow better comprehension and application of the teachings.  By 2016 over forty hours of high quality, specialized esoteric teachings were posted to the Institute for Hermetic Studies YouTube Channel, where anyone with internet access could begin to progressively make their way through them.  In the Spring of 2016 the Institute for Hermetic Studies raised over $3,000 (127% of its stated goal) to produce Words of My Teachers, a companion guide to the IHS Audio Programs.  Words of My Teachers contains all of the handouts originally provided in a single comprehensive fashion, taking the student step-by-step through the teachings.

Why It Is Needed
However, the audio programs vary in sound quality, and with any live teaching, certain areas of discussion contain language that is contextual.  As such, in February 2017 we published the first of several volumes containing the complete edited, annotated, and corrected transcripts from the series, Unfolding the Rose : Illumination and Western Esotericism.  In July 2017 a second published transcript was added, Mind of Hermes: Illumination and Western Esotericism, followed by Pathology of the Sublime: Problems & Solutions on the Spiritual Journey in early August. One additional transcript is under production for publishing before the end of the year.

Pathology of the Sublime: Problems and Solutions on the Spiritual Journey
https://www.amazon.com/dp/1974225577/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501857977&sr=8-1&keywords=Mark+Stavish+pathology+of+the+sublime
            Transcripts of the programs were provided by volunteers. As the work involved proved both tedious and demanding, many of those who volunteered dropped out before its completion. Our gratitude goes out to those few individuals who completed their assignments; however, it became clear that -- for most of them -- this was not the sort of project they would like to work on again.  Therefore, to complete the publishing of the entire audio series in a timely manner, we needed to look for something other than volunteers to provide the transcripts for editing and annotating.  To accomplish this it was suggested that we utilize a professional transcription service.  After doing our research several possible providers were located and samples of their work obtained.
            To complete the publishing of all teachings contained in the IHS Audio Programs before the end of 2018, the Institute for Hermetic Studies is seeking to raise $5,000 to pay for professional transcription of the remaining programs, editing, proofreading, fundraising platform fees, and donor perks.
 
The following titles in the series are available:
Words of My Teachers
Meditation and Rituals
Liturgy of Hermes:  In Praise of the Lord of Light
Unfolding the Rose: Illumination and Western Esotericism
Mind of Hermes:  Visionary Experiences and Western Esotericism
 
The following will be released before the end of 2017:
Sanctus: Spirituality in Daily Life & The Secret Fire
 
To be completed are:
Oral Commentary on Lucid Dreaming, Astral Projection, and the Body of Light
Inner Alchemy and Magic: Physical Rejuvenation and Psychic Illumination
Ritual Purification, Exorcism, and Defensive Magic
Pow-Wow: Traditional Germanic Folk and Grimoire Magic
Jupiter in Daily Life: Practices for Health, Wealth, Wisdom and Bliss 
This is a tremendous amount of work, in truth, it requires more funding than what we are asking for.  If you have not done so already, I encourage you to listen to one of our Audio Programs as well as to read Words of My Teachers along alongside Unfolding the Rose, Mind of Hermes , and Pathology of the Sublime to see for yourself the quality and effectiveness of these teachings and our publishing projects. 
 
What Makes This Unique
This will be the fourth successful fundraising campaign the Institute has held, and one whose importance we cannot overestimate.  These are important and critical teachings for the Path, but by their nature they are not widely ""commercially successful."" That means that traditional publishers will not even consider them as they appeal to a niche set of readers and practitioners.  We therefore turn to you for your assistance in keeping these ideals available and alive!
So many people over the last twenty years have expressed to me: “Thank you for all that your do for the community!”  Now it is my turn to respond with a sincere ""thank you"" to each and every one of you, for all that you yourselves are about to do for the community. 
Make your donation now -- make it today -- and make it as big and meaningful as you can possibly imagine.  In this way, through your help and support, we will be able to provide this generation's students of esotericism, but future generations as well, with material that will act as a true friend and guide to them as they journey on the Path of Return.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Anthropoid Co</i> and <i>Reservoir Journal</i> are raising money to attend the <a href=""https://www.awpwriter.org/awp_conference/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2017 Association of Writers &amp; Writing Programs (AWP) Conference</a> in Washington D.C. Every year the conference hosts a book fair for literary journals and organizations. The book fair would provide a great opportunity for us to network with writers, promote the work we've published, and hand out promotional goodies.</p>
<p>Last year around 12,000 people attended the conference. Between our two journals, we've already published numerous issues and we want to continue to reach new audiences and writers.

<h3>What Will You Do If Your Goal is Not Met?</h3>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, the money we raise will go towards paying for promotional materials and campaign rewards, and recouping some of the cost of the book fair table.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Anthropoid Co and Reservoir Journal are raising money to attend the 2017 Association of Writers & Writing Programs (AWP) Conference in Washington D.C. Every year the conference hosts a book fair for literary journals and organizations. The book fair would provide a great opportunity for us to network with writers, promote the work we've published, and hand out promotional goodies.
Last year around 12,000 people attended the conference. Between our two journals, we've already published numerous issues and we want to continue to reach new audiences and writers.

<p>Hello and hola. I’m Julio Urdaneta and I’m the Editor and Publisher of Arenga\Digital, a Spanish-language news and opinion website. </p>
<p>Arenga\Digital’s mission is simple: Give a voice to journalists in Latin America and Spain, showcasing long form and editorials on issues that are often ignored by the American press. </p>
<p>The influence of Latin America is increasing daily in terms of economics, politics and culture. But it doesn’t stop there: From the prices at grocery stores to the democratic process, nearly everything – including the words we use, the music we hear, the movies we watch and the clothes we wear – is influenced by the realities south of the border.</p>
<p>What happens in Mexico City, San Jose, Bogota, Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro impact Latino life as anything that happens in New York or Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>Arenga\Digital brings these stories to the forefront, shining a spotlight so readers find the news that matters to them now... or the news that will impact them in the coming days. </p>
<p>But our mission doesn't end here. </p>
<p>Arenga\Digital wants to become a place where journalists can also improve their reporting and storytelling skills. Having been hired as a consultant to teach journalism in Latin America, I have learned that professional development for journalists is often an afterthought: The priority is to continuously break news – often without the type of proper reporting and fact checking that should be held as a standard. Too many outlets today rely on the element of surprise, the shock factor, and sensationalism over depth and context. </p>
<p>Arenga\Digital will change that. </p>
<p>Journalists from Latin America will be able to pitch their stories to a team of highly respected journalists and experts all over the world who will critique and edit their work.</p>
<p>The end product will be journalism of the highest caliber, such as:</p>
<p>Venezuela: Las verdades tras la política</p>
<p>De Trainspotting a Breaking Bad: cambia la droga, no el gobierno</p>
<p>India: Un latinoamericano describe los rituales, la comida y los bailes en un boda sij</p>
<p>Deslave de El Cambray 2: Otro octubre negro en Guatemala</p>
<p>In order to pursue our goals to inform and teach, we need your support. </p>
<p>Thank you very much for your support. Please share this campaign with your friends!  And follow us on Twitter and become our friend on Facebook. </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We want to raise US$5000 to: </p>
<p>- Pay for operating costs (server, domain, hosting, etc.)</p>
<p>- Pay our writers and contributors a small stipend for their work. Each will get US$ 25 per published story. </p>
<p>- Register Arenga\Digital as a proper business and/or NGO (we want to be able to solicit grants and tax-exempt donations in the future).</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We have a running website featuring an array of stories.</p>
<p>We're extremely proud of the work that has been done, but so far all of it has been pro bono.</p>
<p>If we are going to demand the best from our reporters and editorialists, they must be compensated. If we are going to demand stories be carefully researched, fact checked, and live up to the highest journalistic standards... the time and training required for that needs to be rewarded.</p>
<p>If I am to demand the best, my reporters demand to be treated like the best. <br/>If I get the funding, I will be able to expedite the growth of the site, and more importantly... it's mission.</p>
<p>There are stories out there you need to know about. They may be stories of your family in San Salvador or about your business partners in Buenos Aires. They may be stories about the environment, the drug war, or archaeological discoveries involving the Maya and Inca.</p>
<p>The world is open, but our eyes will never be opened to it unless we turn our attention to the stories that would otherwise remain unseen.</p>

Finding One's Own Way is a story of how a child remembers and recovers perennial wisdom.  It is a road map to your own true IdentityIf you could Remember Who You Really Are, you would understand your potential and you would change things.In fact you just might change everything!I founded ONE’S OWN WAY because of a deep love for truth and while in pursuit of it I acquired a powerful freedom.  The simplicity of how I came to possess this freedom I knew needed to be shared.    There have been many movements but never has one been designed to set us all free. No group or organization wants you to be 100% free because groups and organizations need to control some part of you. So Individuality has been concealed and deniedAnd I have discovered that no one needs to exist that way.I wrote Finding One's Own Way to encourage you to un-cover Your very own truth...that unique identity of yours buried beneath beliefs that do not reflect who you really are.  When I stopped believing the lie that I must fit myself into whatever most closely I related to or resembled, I recovered my unique qualities and discovered abilities. Beliefs given to us or forced upon us crush, cover and conceal our distinctiveness and weaken our power.Every designation eclipses our uniqueness, and accessing our very real abilities has been shrouded in mystery and cloaked with confusion. We all have been ignored and denied to lesser or greater degree's and while grappling to be heard we are further crushed and our voice obscured.This is the Book that will ignite a great movement toward everyone’s individual truth and bring a light of awareness to not only your truths value but your truths great power.You will recover your abilities when you remember who you are. Navigating the intrusiveness of negativity in all its forms without dependency on anyone or anything is possible with the skills you already possess. Finding One’s Own Way imparts the wisdom the movement will carry.  Because of the power of funding platforms and specifically Indiegogo’s ability to reach internationally I feel this is where I can garner the most awareness with your support.ImpactBeginning with us as individuals and then our families; spreading a restorative message throughout communities, Finding One’s Own Way is the keystone to Healing and overcoming everything from trauma and depression to bullying. Who would put a price on even one life? The impact is incalculable.I have been foregoing income for nearly a year now…The Book is greatly anticipated and its sales will enable me to pursue speaking to the great numbers of hurting and discarded individualsWith your help to publish and promote FINDING ONES WAY I will be able to effectively continue.This is the Book that will ignite a great movement and bring awareness to Individuality’s value, releasing countless from a myriad of bondage and giving them, giving you, the power to change what is necessary to find one’s own sense of happiness.This is a message whose time has come for a world in desperate need.Funding is the only way I may complete this project.“There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come” ― Victor HugoWhere do contributions go?I have managed to accomplish everything up to this point with little to no expense.The reality of publishing costs is that it will take $9,000 to properly produce, promote and market “Finding One’s Own Way” and that goal helps to get “WHO ARE YOU REALLY?” illustrated and published to help our young children begin their own adventures without the intrusiveness of negativity which results in being bullied.It will not stop there as I have 4 more messages for children and hundreds of inspirational quotes to be published.How can you help?Reserve a personalized signed copy for a pledge of $50orshow your support with as little as $1 and join the virtual flash mob to help retain prominence on Indiegogo’s platformHelp us exceed our goal of $9,000 - trigger international recognition!!!Continue to share-as we all know-The Power of the Word.THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!!!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>On a cold January day in the Windy City in 2010, I received the pathologist’s call telling me that I had breast cancer. At first I felt calm and rational. As a parish pastor, I had tended to so many women with breast cancer over the years that I simply thought “well, one in eight women gets this diagnosis in her lifetime.” But things quickly became more personal and fragile as I made complex treatment decisions, lost my hair, spent nine days in the hospital critically ill from a reaction to a study drug, and lost my identity as a healthy career woman.</p>
<p>Six months later, as soon as I was back on my feet, I started working on this project of shaping a workbook for breast cancer survivors to gather for group wisdom, support and spiritual guidance. I wanted to create a safe place for women to tell stories without feeling the need to edit or censor, as sometimes happens with co-workers, partners, children, or friends. The workbook serves as a springboard for discussion and healing, and guides participants through seven sessions complete with exercises, devotional readings, and ample opportunity to share one’s stories with other participants. The consistent structure and carefully worded guidelines allow women to lead their own group process without need of an outside authority or expert. Taking an ecumenical and interfaith approach, <i>A New Song to Sing</i> welcomes participants of all faiths and backgrounds, and can be modified for use in a variety of different religious and spiritual traditions.</p>
<p>Breast cancer can be an isolating experience for many, and the journey is a vulnerable one. My dream is to help women tap into that vulnerability to allow a deepened relationship with the Holy, to know themselves to be beloved, and to claim their deepest truth. Writing this book was a way to insist that I maintain my own vulnerability, rather than closing myself off from the experience and pretending it never happened. I hope and pray that <i>A New Song to Sing</i> creates space to fully embrace the possibilities for spiritual growth and healing, even years after treatment.</p>
<p>Writing this book has been my focus for the past five years, and no doubt it has been a source of my own continued healing. Pilot groups using this workbook have been conducted in the Midwest and Southwest, and I am profoundly encouraged by those positive experiences, and the love and faith cultivated in those settings. To me, the important thing is to make this book available to as many communities as possible, and as many survivors as possible. Then we will all be a little closer to living into our hope, and living into our truth. Some days I dare to believe I was meant to write this book. Some days I dare to believe I will live to see it make a difference.</p>

<p>Reverend Linda C. Loving is a writer, actor, ordained Presbyterian minister, and breast cancer survivor. She has more than thirty years of parish ministry experience around the country; prior to that she spent ten years in hospital work. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Theatre from the University of Michigan, completed graduate work in hospital administration at Trinity University, and received her Master of Divinity as well as the Ellen and James Taylor Preaching Award and the Henry W. Andersen Award in Pastoral Ministry from McCormick Theological Seminary. She also performed the one-woman drama “Julian” for over 26 years. Linda is eager to get this book into the hands of those longing for spiritual growth and healing, wherever they may be on their breast cancer journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Others are Saying</h3>
<p>“Linda C. Loving’s spiritual guide for navigating the breast cancer journey is inspirational and heartfelt and combines Linda’s generous authenticity with her deep wisdom and gifted eloquence as a spiritual leader. <i>A New Song to Sing</i> is relevant for use with groups seeking spiritual wholeness during other serious illnesses or life challenges as well. I am heartened that this spiritual support resource is now available and look forward to its widespread use in faith-based communities.”</p>
<p>—Betsy Finkelmeier, RN, MBA, Healthcare Consultant</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“[A] treasure chest of resources! <i>A New Song to Sing </i>should be in every church, synagogue and mosque library and readily available to every faith leader among whose congregations are many who should not have to face breast cancer alone.”</p>
<p>—John M. Buchanan, Former Editor/Publisher: <i>The Christian Century</i> , Pastor Emeritus: The Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I had never been to the church; but, I quickly found that I ‘belonged’ on this journey of women who were sharing their stories, support and love. I was amazed at the end when I realized that I had forgotten we all had cancer!”</p>
<p>—Maureen, Pilot Project Participant</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“As a nineteen year survivor, what I learned is that I really needed the women in this group to help me understand how much the experience had shaped my life. Through the exercises suggested in this workbook, I learned how to trust the support and love I was offered on this journey. What a marvelous tool”</p>
<p>—Jeannie, Pilot Project Participant</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Part journal, part workbook, <i>A New Song to Sing </i>offers the wisdom and courage of experience and the confidence of the author’s deep faith and gracious spirit. It provides an inspirational framework to create community, and a ‘sisterhood of spirit’ with readings, resiliency training and self-reflection. It is rare to see health, healing and faith woven together so smoothly. Its message will resonate with anyone whose life has been shaken by a serious loss or illness.”</p>
<p>—Jamie Von Roenn, MD, V.P. Education, Science, &amp; Professional Development, American Society of Clinical Oncology</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“An innovative template for those with the shared experience of breast cancer to create small ecumenical communities to facilitate spiritual and emotional healing.  By sharing her own story, and showing how others can do the same in a warm, compassionate environment, Linda C. Loving provides a place for women to reflect, belong and begin anew. I heartily recommend <i>A New Song to Sing</i> to my patients and colleagues.”</p>

We are also creating short films to campaign against SGBV, hold peace building workshops for women as we had the worst Post Election Violence in 2007 with women and children being victims of violence physically and sexually.</p><p>The aim of the Maverick Woman Project by Lalona Women Magazine Africa, is to ensure that women in Africa are exposed to the possibility that women can defy the norms and work together regrdless of cultural barriers and tribal afiliations (a great menace in Africa) to be what they have envisioned without the worry of escaping cultural imprisonment in relations to their ideologies and dreams.</p><p>This will be made possible by availing tangible documentation both digital and printed to showcase ideologies and changes made by our ordinary, everyday heroes. We need these stories, told, heard and recorded to last eternity.</p><p>Most of us know great women: the late Wangari, Chimamanda, Malala, Oprah Winfrey, or Martha Gellhorn but we do not relate much to them - which shouldn't be the case but unfortunately it is. We can however relate to women that do great things, which we barely hear about.</p><p>We hardly know much about the women who should inspire us daily. We have many inspirational stories of great women like Oprah Winfrey but how about anyone back home in our villages? </p><p>We want to talk about these everyday heroes that have focused on changing the society one initiative at a time and through writing about them. We want young women to know that they can make change in their societies by writing about the local Maverick women.</p><p>The project will be published at Lalonas.com (<a href=""http://lalonas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a>).</p><p><strong>A book will be published</strong> to document and profile each and every selected work. This book will have various stories and ideologies on Maverick Women.</p><p>African women are Maverick in their own way and unless we show young Kenyan girls and boys such women - they will keep wondering if they are enough to make a change.</p><p>We also have the Sexual and Gender based violence short films to create awareness and campaign against SGBV in our societies while incorporating inclusion and diversity of young boys and girls with a focus on their basic rights in societal policies and projects.</p><p>This project will not be possible without the help of phenomenal people like you. It would be breathtaking to have your support</p><p><strong><u>ADDITIONAL INFO ON LALONA, CREATIVES PIAZZA AND THE  MAVERICK WOMAN PROJECT</u></strong></p><p>The Maverick Woman project entails calling for submissions of posts <i>(every genre)</i>, art and illustrations from young women and men on their ideologies, views and <strong>tangible examples</strong> of Maverick women</p><p>This project also aims at empowering women on both exploring their talents and also expressing their ideologies to matters that concern their human rights.</p><p><u><strong>THE Sexual- Gender Based Violence FILM PROJECT</strong></u></p><p>The SGBV film project will be aligned with the outreach programs at Lalona. The SGBV film project plus drama therapy for children, peace building workshops and education on human rights will be done alongside the outreach programs. </p><p>We, as Lalona, aim at working with young creatives hence, with the SGBV film project and the 4 other initiative highighted in the banner above- we have identified 2 young directors and writers Oprah Oyugi (oprahoyugi.com) and Cherotich Kibet to come up with a team that will be a part of the initiative to sensitize the community on SGBV using various local films in collaboration with the local Television channels all over the 47 counties in Kenya.</p><p><u><strong>HOW DID THE LALONA MAVERICK WOMAN PROJECT COME TO BE?</strong></u></p><p>We started off as Creatives Piazza. As young women, barely 8 months ago, we received your support here and launched the women's Hub for African women in the creative space</p><p>We are gratitude filled by your overwhelming support of Creatives Piazza- the African Hub for women that has now expanded to Lalona Magazine. Thank you for believing in us- the three 24 year old Founders. We are proud to present a website that lets writers<strong> (most of them are under 26)</strong> illustrate and highlight on Gender equality, inclusion and diversity, social issues and environmental conservation- The <a href=""http://lalonas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Lalona Magazine.</strong></a></p><p>The public and each one of you has been a great impact in the lives of the amazing women that have gotten the opportunity to showcase their talent and earn revenue from Creatives Piazza's initiatives and projects through your support and interaction. We now have confidence in our talents and passions as women in the creative space. Lalona, was launched 2 weeks ago as a succession of Creatives Piazza in relations to addressing the current situation globally and nationally.</p><p>Lalona aims at giving the African young woman the confidence to believe in their ideologies by compiling various illustrations and writings on historical Maverick women to date.

We are also creating short films to campaign against SGBV, hold peace building workshops for women as we had the worst Post Election Violence in 2007 with women and children being victims of violence physically and sexually.The aim of the Maverick Woman Project by Lalona Women Magazine Africa, is to ensure that women in Africa are exposed to the possibility that women can defy the norms and work together regrdless of cultural barriers and tribal afiliations (a great menace in Africa) to be what they have envisioned without the worry of escaping cultural imprisonment in relations to their ideologies and dreams.This will be made possible by availing tangible documentation both digital and printed to showcase ideologies and changes made by our ordinary, everyday heroes. We need these stories, told, heard and recorded to last eternity.Most of us know great women: the late Wangari, Chimamanda, Malala, Oprah Winfrey, or Martha Gellhorn but we do not relate much to them - which shouldn't be the case but unfortunately it is. We can however relate to women that do great things, which we barely hear about.We hardly know much about the women who should inspire us daily. We have many inspirational stories of great women like Oprah Winfrey but how about anyone back home in our villages? We want to talk about these everyday heroes that have focused on changing the society one initiative at a time and through writing about them. We want young women to know that they can make change in their societies by writing about the local Maverick women.The project will be published at Lalonas.com (our website).A book will be published to document and profile each and every selected work. This book will have various stories and ideologies on Maverick Women.African women are Maverick in their own way and unless we show young Kenyan girls and boys such women - they will keep wondering if they are enough to make a change.We also have the Sexual and Gender based violence short films to create awareness and campaign against SGBV in our societies while incorporating inclusion and diversity of young boys and girls with a focus on their basic rights in societal policies and projects.This project will not be possible without the help of phenomenal people like you. It would be breathtaking to have your supportADDITIONAL INFO ON LALONA, CREATIVES PIAZZA AND THE  MAVERICK WOMAN PROJECTThe Maverick Woman project entails calling for submissions of posts (every genre), art and illustrations from young women and men on their ideologies, views and tangible examples of Maverick womenThis project also aims at empowering women on both exploring their talents and also expressing their ideologies to matters that concern their human rights.THE Sexual- Gender Based Violence FILM PROJECTThe SGBV film project will be aligned with the outreach programs at Lalona. The SGBV film project plus drama therapy for children, peace building workshops and education on human rights will be done alongside the outreach programs. We, as Lalona, aim at working with young creatives hence, with the SGBV film project and the 4 other initiative highighted in the banner above- we have identified 2 young directors and writers Oprah Oyugi (oprahoyugi.com) and Cherotich Kibet to come up with a team that will be a part of the initiative to sensitize the community on SGBV using various local films in collaboration with the local Television channels all over the 47 counties in Kenya.HOW DID THE LALONA MAVERICK WOMAN PROJECT COME TO BE?We started off as Creatives Piazza. As young women, barely 8 months ago, we received your support here and launched the women's Hub for African women in the creative spaceWe are gratitude filled by your overwhelming support of Creatives Piazza- the African Hub for women that has now expanded to Lalona Magazine. Thank you for believing in us- the three 24 year old Founders. We are proud to present a website that lets writers (most of them are under 26) illustrate and highlight on Gender equality, inclusion and diversity, social issues and environmental conservation- The Lalona Magazine.The public and each one of you has been a great impact in the lives of the amazing women that have gotten the opportunity to showcase their talent and earn revenue from Creatives Piazza's initiatives and projects through your support and interaction. We now have confidence in our talents and passions as women in the creative space. Lalona, was launched 2 weeks ago as a succession of Creatives Piazza in relations to addressing the current situation globally and nationally.Lalona aims at giving the African young woman the confidence to believe in their ideologies by compiling various illustrations and writings on historical Maverick women to date. It will also pinpoint Feminism influences both socially, politically and economically. All these posts published on Lalona will then be compiled at the end of the project and published into a book. Despite addressing gender based issues at Lalona, we will have other projects that ensure that the rights of the women are not only respected but educated as well. Especially during conflict and in vulnerable situations as well. Kenya had the worst ever Post Election Violence in our history and the victims were women and children. SGBV led to tons of women and children to lose their lives and Maverick women came about and became support system for the victims of PEV. Hence, projects mentioned will be effective into ensuring this is implemented.In the past 8 months that Creatives Piazza has been running, we have had the following milestones:1. We have launched a new virtual Magazine- Lalona, which we will proudly point out was designed by our Founder, who is self taught when it comes to web design and coding. Lalona represents our ideologies and expectations of the magazine for the year forward.Due to public demand by our creatives on the need for a unified online initiative, we changed our website from creatives Piazza to Lalona.

<p></p><h2>PROJECT SUMMARY  </h2><p>In this imaginative 
children's book that gently makes astrophysics fun for the under 10 set,
 Miss Thorb is a substitute teacher from Mars currently on assignment at
 Enderfink Elementary in Topeka.</p>
<p>After traveling more than 62 million miles, this sub who works the 
solar system circuit is simply appalled that her class knows little 
about the universe.  Determined to enlighten her students, Miss Thorb 
paints a colorful and delightful cosmic cornucopia of planets and alien 
cultures that will challenge their imaginations.</p><p>Beyond colorful and highly entertaining, this book is interactive and 
three-dimensional—using an exclusive technology that has never before 
appeared in a children's book: ""space creatures"" can walk right off the 
pages and right into the reader's hands.<br/></p><br/><h2>THE TECHNOLOGY</h2><p>Here on Earth, we call 
it 'interactive augmented reality,' a highly sophisticated algorithm. 
Take out your smart phone or tablet and, utilizing an app, you'll be 
able to see through the screen of your device 3D characters—just point 
the screen at this book. </p><p>You can touch and interact with them, or
 just watch as they run around the page. Through allowing children to 
engage with emotionally intelligent characters, children remain focused 
on the story, adding an exciting and new level of reading enjoyment. </p><p>And <b>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CHILDREN'S PUBLISHING HISTORY, THIS IS THE BOOK THAT KEEPS ON CHANGING</b>.
 In addition to 10 planets throughout the story where children can meet 
and touch and interact with aliens who walk right off the page, we are 
including a special 'vacation planet' in the back of the book. <b>EVERY TIME YOUR CHILD POINTS A SMARTPHONE AT THIS PLANET, A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF ALIENS WILL APPEAR THERE!</b> The proprietary algorithm and randomized database linked to the book will produce an entire galaxy of intergalactic creatures.</p>
<p><i>This 36-page story, told entirely in verse, taps the beautiful, quirky art of Marcela Vargas. Other than the portrait of <b>Miss Maree Thorb</b> (below), which the illustrator created for 'Our Teacher is a Creature,' t</i><i>he
 illustrations to follow are from Marcela's portfolio. They are from 
Marcelaa's other projects and are here only to give you a sense of her 
style and the caliber of beautifully whimsical art that Marcela brings 
to 'Our Teacher is a Creature.' <br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466470333/MISS_THORB_CloseUp_with_white_border_tym6li.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>THE STORY</h2><p><i>Our Teacher is a Creature </i>originated
 in 2005. At the time, it was only 33 verses. Since then, and with the 
encouragement of children's publishers, the story has developed into 
more than 200 verses adding new depth to Miss Thorb's adventure—now, the
 Martian substitute teacher takes her students to the Kennedy Space 
Center, where the class, taking the ultimate field trip, boards a rocket
 headed for the International Space Station (I.S.S.). The story is 
complete and is further enriched with characters and amusing verses that
 should thrill any young child.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466470386/cake-SM_zajbg9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The goal of <i>Our Teacher is a Creature </i>is to inspire in children a curiosity about space and the world around them, and a love for reading.

</h1><h2><b>HOW INDIEGOGO WORKS</b></h2><h1>
</h1><p>Before you see how we will invest your support into this project, 
we feel it's important for you to understand how this crowdfunding 
platform operates.  If we don't raise our entire budget, <i>you are <b>not</b> charged.</i>
</p>
<p>It's all-or-nothing around here. We must raise the entire budget by
 the end of the campaign, or Indiegogo won't charge any of the 
Backers' credit or debit cards. No money is held back during the 
campaign. There's zero risk if we don't reach our production budget. 

</p><h1><br/></h1><h1><b>=========================</b></h1>
<h2>
<br/>
</h2><h2>
<b>THE PRODUCTION BUDGET</b>
</h2>
<div>If we're going to produce this children's book in record 
space-time, we're going to need funding.  We've arranged two stages of 
funding, one for the creatively illustrated children's book; the other 
for the creatively illustrated children's book married to interactive 
augmented reality.

<p>We're dedicating every dime to this project.  We're investing your 
contributions to the production of a really cool book—written, 
illustrated, designed, and printed by some really cool and creative 
people. Here's how we'll put your money to creative work for both the 
BOOK BUDGET ($9995) and the INTERACTIVE AUGMENTED REALITY BUDGET 
</p>
<div>
<b>THE BOOK BUDGET</b>
<p>The Illustrator.................................................$6,000</p>
<h2>  +</h2>
<p>The Designer.................................................$900</p>
<h2>  +</h2>
<p>The Author.....................................................$0 (waiving fee)</p>
<h2> +</h2>
<p>The Printing....................................................$6,000</p>
<p>($5.50/ea for 1000 books + setup)</p>
<p>Legal / Accounting..........................................$250</p>
<p>________________

<h1> =<b> $13,150</b>

<h1><b>========================     <br/></b></h1>
<p><b>INTERACTIVE AUGMENTED REALITY BUDGET (STRETCH GOAL)</b></p>
<p>Wiggle Planet app and creature creations......$7000</p>
<p><b>            +</b></p>
<p>Legal / Accounting...........................................$250

</p>
<div>________________

<h2> = $7250</h2>
<p>If we raise our BOOK BUDGET before the campaign ends, you can be 
sure that we will present our universe of Backers with a series of 
'Stretch Goals,' allowing us to cover, among other opportunities: </p>
<p>*Producing the book as an interactive augmented reality experience
</p>
<div>*Printing 1000 additional copies (2000 copies = $4.50/each + setup)
<div>*Donating copies of 'Our Teacher is a Creature' to the school of each Backer's choice 
<p>*Covering additional online and offline promotional work, so that we're not just driving this in-house </p>
<p>*Donating copies of the book to the children's charities our Backers recommend we approach.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1><b>========================</b></h1>
<p>  </p>
<h2>
<b>THE IMPACT</b> </h2>
<p>We'd like to think that our project has universal appeal.  We just need a little help to get it off the planet. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, our hope is that <i>Our Teacher is a Creature </i>will
 inspire children. Child literacy and developing a love of books from an
 early age are worthy goals, and to do so in a fun way? Even better! And
 ""fun"" is a word that accurately describes <i>Our Teacher is a Creature</i>—from
 the verses to the characters to the 'space creatures' that spring off 
the page, everything about this book is entertaining. </p>
<p>Beyond that, we'd like 'Our Teacher is a Creature' to become the 
world's first 'Best Stellar' -- the first crowdfunded children's book to
 demonstrate stratospheric, possibly meteoric, visibility.  Wait till 
you hear about some of responses we've been receiving from some of those
 companies pioneering commercial space flight. They're positively out of
 this world!</p>

<h2><b>A TROUPE OF ACTORS BRING THE STORY TO LIFE. </b></h2>
<p>
Too Nuts Productions boasts some extraordinarily talented voiceover 
actors. We asked them to bring a few verses from the story to life just 
to show you how they might sound to your kids.  (The illustrations below
 were created by our production intern, Noisette D. specifically for our Indiegogo. They're not in the book. That's Marcela's dept.)  <br/></p>

<p>We believe this story will captivate young readers. Children are 
transfixed when we read the book to them, and let them test out the 
'alien technology'. An engaging story, otherworldly illustrations, and 
cutting-edge, interactive tech accessible by a cell or tablet app, will 
make 'Our Teacher is a Creature' a prize addition to any child's book 
collection—and a collectible piece that will be handed down through 
generations.</p>
<p>In addition, we've contracted one of the most reputable 
self-publishers in the U.S. to ensure that we deliver this project by 
our deadline, even ahead of deadline. The story has been written. It's 
ready to go. All we need are a few contributions to get it on 
bookshelves near you.</p><br/><br/></div>","A tantalizing story. An amazing technology.[Limited Edition: Own one of the first volumes from the 1000 first run private printing.] Too
 Nuts Productions partners with WigglePlanet to produce the first 
children's book in history where the characters leave the page and walk 
around outside the book.SEE IT NOW!TRY IT NOW!iPHONE users:

 Teacher is a Creature' are in development right now. Pictured below are
 non-alien creatures from the WigglePlanet portfolio. Miss Thorb's 
aliens in 'Our Teacher is a Creature' will look very different than 
these.)

PROJECT SUMMARY  In this imaginative 
children's book that gently makes astrophysics fun for the under 10 set,
 Miss Thorb is a substitute teacher from Mars currently on assignment at
 Enderfink Elementary in Topeka.
After traveling more than 62 million miles, this sub who works the 
solar system circuit is simply appalled that her class knows little 
about the universe.  Determined to enlighten her students, Miss Thorb 
paints a colorful and delightful cosmic cornucopia of planets and alien 
cultures that will challenge their imaginations.Beyond colorful and highly entertaining, this book is interactive and 
three-dimensional—using an exclusive technology that has never before 
appeared in a children's book: ""space creatures"" can walk right off the 
pages and right into the reader's hands.THE TECHNOLOGYHere on Earth, we call 
it 'interactive augmented reality,' a highly sophisticated algorithm. 
Take out your smart phone or tablet and, utilizing an app, you'll be 
able to see through the screen of your device 3D characters—just point 
the screen at this book. You can touch and interact with them, or
 just watch as they run around the page. Through allowing children to 
engage with emotionally intelligent characters, children remain focused 
on the story, adding an exciting and new level of reading enjoyment. And FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CHILDREN'S PUBLISHING HISTORY, THIS IS THE BOOK THAT KEEPS ON CHANGING.
 In addition to 10 planets throughout the story where children can meet 
and touch and interact with aliens who walk right off the page, we are 
including a special 'vacation planet' in the back of the book. EVERY TIME YOUR CHILD POINTS A SMARTPHONE AT THIS PLANET, A WHOLE NEW GROUP OF ALIENS WILL APPEAR THERE! The proprietary algorithm and randomized database linked to the book will produce an entire galaxy of intergalactic creatures.
This 36-page story, told entirely in verse, taps the beautiful, quirky art of Marcela Vargas. Other than the portrait of Miss Maree Thorb (below), which the illustrator created for 'Our Teacher is a Creature,' the
 illustrations to follow are from Marcela's portfolio. They are from 
Marcelaa's other projects and are here only to give you a sense of her 
style and the caliber of beautifully whimsical art that Marcela brings 
to 'Our Teacher is a Creature.' THE STORYOur Teacher is a Creature originated
 in 2005. At the time, it was only 33 verses. Since then, and with the 
encouragement of children's publishers, the story has developed into 
more than 200 verses adding new depth to Miss Thorb's adventure—now, the
 Martian substitute teacher takes her students to the Kennedy Space 
Center, where the class, taking the ultimate field trip, boards a rocket
 headed for the International Space Station (I.S.S.). The story is 
complete and is further enriched with characters and amusing verses that
 should thrill any young child.The goal of Our Teacher is a Creature is to inspire in children a curiosity about space and the world around them, and a love for reading. While it is not
 a scientific textbook, it is covertly educational—in fact, this book 
comes courtesy of Too Nuts Productions, a Bay Area-based kid lit content
 developer, whose motto is, ""Creatively entertaining while covertly 
educating!"" (A slogan that sums up Our Teacher is a Creature quite well.)Beyond the groundbreaking technology that will liven up the pages of 
this book, the story at its core is a delightful read kids will love. EXCERPT FROM THE STORY:THE COLLABORATION A terrific story with terrific technology. Too Nuts Productions has collaborated with Wiggle Planet, to combine proprietary interactive augmented reality with beautifully written children's story.Wiggle
 Planet—which had a successful run on Kickstarter previously—specializes
 in a unique, interactive software that is easily accessed by anyone 
with a smart phone or tablet, and devoured by children.  WHY KEEP THIS BOOK ON EARTH?
AS YOU READ THIS, so are an elite roster of commercial space 
payload companies that are building the rockets and space planes that 
will some day soon make commercial space flight a weekly, even daily, 
event. A few of these aerospace companies are now delivering supplies 
and experiments to the International Space Station. We've approached the cool peeps at NASA and ten commercial payload 
companies to see if we can get a copy or two of 'Our Teacher is a 
Creature' on a future payload to the International Space Station.  Who
 knows? We might just get an astronaut to read our children's story to a
 world of children eager to know what's out there. And when that 
astronaut whips out a tablet? ""Aliens"" will be jumping all over the 
space station! =========================


HOW INDIEGOGO WORKS
Before you see how we will invest your support into this project, 
we feel it's important for you to understand how this crowdfunding 
platform operates.  If we don't raise our entire budget, you are not charged.

It's all-or-nothing around here. We must raise the entire budget by
 the end of the campaign, or Indiegogo won't charge any of the 
Backers' credit or debit cards. No money is held back during the 
campaign. There's zero risk if we don't reach our production budget. 

=========================



THE PRODUCTION BUDGET

If we're going to produce this children's book in record 
space-time, we're going to need funding.  We've arranged two stages of 
funding, one for the creatively illustrated children's book; the other 
for the creatively illustrated children's book married to interactive 
augmented reality.

We're dedicating every dime to this project.  We're investing your 
contributions to the production of a really cool book—written, 
illustrated, designed, and printed by some really cool and creative 
people. Here's how we'll put your money to creative work for both the 
BOOK BUDGET ($9995) and the INTERACTIVE AUGMENTED REALITY BUDGET 


THE BOOK BUDGET
The Illustrator.................................................$6,000
  +
The Designer.................................................$900
  +
The Author.....................................................$0 (waiving fee)
 +
The Printing....................................................$6,000
($5.50/ea for 1000 books + setup)
Legal / Accounting..........................................$250
________________
 
 = $13,150


========================     
INTERACTIVE AUGMENTED REALITY BUDGET (STRETCH GOAL)
Wiggle Planet app and creature creations......$7000
            +
Legal / Accounting...........................................$250


________________

 = $7250
If we raise our BOOK BUDGET before the campaign ends, you can be 
sure that we will present our universe of Backers with a series of 
'Stretch Goals,' allowing us to cover, among other opportunities: 
*Producing the book as an interactive augmented reality experience

*Printing 1000 additional copies (2000 copies = $4.50/each + setup)
*Donating copies of 'Our Teacher is a Creature' to the school of each Backer's choice 
*Covering additional online and offline promotional work, so that we're not just driving this in-house 
*Donating copies of the book to the children's charities our Backers recommend we approach.

========================
  

THE IMPACT 
We'd like to think that our project has universal appeal.  We just need a little help to get it off the planet. 
As mentioned above, our hope is that Our Teacher is a Creature will
 inspire children. Child literacy and developing a love of books from an
 early age are worthy goals, and to do so in a fun way? Even better! And
 ""fun"" is a word that accurately describes Our Teacher is a Creature—from
 the verses to the characters to the 'space creatures' that spring off 
the page, everything about this book is entertaining. 
Beyond that, we'd like 'Our Teacher is a Creature' to become the 
world's first 'Best Stellar' -- the first crowdfunded children's book to
 demonstrate stratospheric, possibly meteoric, visibility.  Wait till 
you hear about some of responses we've been receiving from some of those
 companies pioneering commercial space flight. They're positively out of
 this world!

========================

A TROUPE OF ACTORS BRING THE STORY TO LIFE. 

Too Nuts Productions boasts some extraordinarily talented voiceover 
actors. We asked them to bring a few verses from the story to life just 
to show you how they might sound to your kids.  (The illustrations below
 were created by our production intern, Noisette D. specifically for our Indiegogo. They're not in the book. That's Marcela's dept.)

FUTURE PROPERTY EXTENSIONS
So what does the future hold for Miss Thorb and Enderfink Elementary? Oou la la! Let our favorite 4th grade substitute teacher from Mars give you a sneak peek.  Expect the Miss Thorb App,
 like the one that the six-year-old girl at the top of this Kickstarter 
tried out during the recent NASA SPACE APPS CHALLENGE at SAP 
headquarters.
The app will allow children throughout this planet to learn about
 the universe with a tap. But in keeping with our Too Nuts Productions 
mandate, we're making sure that we develop and provide content that is 
'Creatively entertaining...while covertly educating!"" Here's a preview
