<p></p><p>Has
your mobile phone battery ever died at the worst possible time?  Do you like to listen to music with family
and friends?  Do you spend time
outdoors?  Then <b>Solarwave is right for
you.</b></p>
<p>Hello,
my name is Connor.  I started Solarwave with my dad, brother and family to address
a problem we all have with mobile devices.  The battery life
is often short lived, and the speakers do not allow you to play music loud enough for your friends and family to enjoy with you.</p>
<p>This is the genius of the Solarwave - a
stylish solution to keeping mobile devices powered using the sun, while entertaining with
Bluetooth speakers to share music. </p>
<p>Imagine you are having a great time at the beach, camping, fishing, hunting, tailgating or wherever you may be that is away from a power outlet. All of a sudden your mobile device battery dies! We have all been there and it always seems to happen at the worst of times. With Solarwave, no problem. Solarwave uses the power of the sun as an endless power source and has enough battery life without the sun to fully charge eight typical mobile devices. On top of keeping all of your devices charged, it has built in high performance wireless Bluetooth speakers to ensure non-stop entertainment for your family and friends. </p>
<p>Your contribution to our campaign and helping by spreading the word to
others will make Solarwave a success. Everything is ready to move quickly into
production. The first $20,000 is needed for startup costs (product mold), but will soon shift to a per-unit cost. First units will ship by September. </p>
<p>We have some great perks including an early bird special for just
$60 to be one of the first to own a Solarwave. We expect future retail to be
over $100. So get yours fast!</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Solarwave has a stylish, compact, durable design for indoor or
outdoor use and stands only 6” (150mm) high, packed with battery power (20,000
mAh – average phone is 1800mAh) and Bluetooth enabled speakers. You can use Solarwave
for entertainment, keep all your mobile devices charged,
and always be ready if the power goes out.  It’s also perfect to just use
the wireless Bluetooth speakers at home, then pack it up in its stylish case when
you head outdoors.  Solarwave is a must

The beauty of the Limelight Power Dock is that it does not replace your existing phone-based workout hardware or apps. Keep using your heart rate or cadence monitor paired to your favorite riding app. The Limelight allows you to keep your existing setup using your phone as the brain.

<p>The idea of a multi-functional bicycle audio device came from Mr. Zhang, a member of The Dream of Guangzhou Cycling Team, and a friend of our manufacturer. Mr. Zhang cycled with his team more than 500km across Malaysia in July 2015 to support the Beijing Olympic Winter Games at the scene of the International Olympic Committee’s 128<sup style=""color: rgb(122, 122, 122);"">th</sup>
session in Kuala Lumpur. The team also traveled to Europe to support the London
Olympic Games and cycled to the Korea to support the Incheon Asian Games. Their ongoing goal is to advocate a low carbon footprint through their cycling
activities. </p>
<p>During these rides Mr. Zhang listened to MP3 music. Another team member asked to use the device to listen to radio, but Mr. Zhang's device was limited to playing MP3.  Mr. Zhang was intrigued with the idea of a more versatile device, and began researching various bike products. He found products that were just lights, others just speakers, and all were limited to few functions and not configurable.  The idea for the Limelight Power Dock was born. </p>
<p>Your phone is more powerful than any wearable, is able to sync with Bluetooth (music, heart rate, cadence etc), is already configured with your favorite riding apps and is the most powerful computer available. It's the perfect brain behind the Limelight </p>
<p>Your phone coupled with the power dock serves as a perfect touring computer. It has all the functions of your phone, GPS turn by turn directions, radio, music, internet, and adds a light, speakers to listen to music, radio or amplify calls and turn by turn directions. It has  a huge battery reserve to keep your phone going on those two day camping trips.</p>
<p>The manufacturer specializes in car, motorcycle and bike technology  used his expertise and experience to design the prototype.</p></span>

Always concerned about my battery, I used my GPS as I would a map. I'd pull it out for directions, then turn it off to conserve power.  But the need to have GPS visible and usable for extended periods of time was strong.  I never really considered a wearable because the battery life is poor as well.  The Limelight is perfect for a touring rider like me. </span>

Are you tired of having to stop and dig your smartphone out of your pocket or your bag to check your phone or use your GPS?  Tired of buying one device for GPS, one device to track your workout, another for listening to playlists, another for a headlight?  Tired of managing your phone to save its precious battery life? 
Perfect for anyone who likes to ride a bike, the Limelight power dock easily connects to your phone via Bluetooth and securely mounts your smartphone to your handlebars. It frees you from the handlebar clutter caused by multiple one-function devices.
The handlebar mount places your smartphone front and center for easy viewing. The built in battery nearly triples your current battery life.  That means you can leave on turn-by turn directions to see your route before you miss your turns. And the Bluetooth connection means you can use all your phone capabilities: your internet connection, your apps, your fitness peripherals, and your playlists,  all day, over a crisp, clear speaker. Limelight's built in buttons make it easy to answer calls and raise or lower the bluetooth speaker volume on the go. 
Limelight lets you actually use all the features of  the best on-board computer you already own - your smartphone. 
It also adds a double LED headlight, and yes, it  has a bell. 
Limelight Power Dock makes your bike a smart bike.




A phone dock,  power bank, Bluetooth Speaker and LED headlight in one elegant, high-quality, easy- to-use device.




Let's face it, wearables such as Fitbit, Gear S2, or Apple Watch 
don't deliver what a cyclist wants. We want to use GPS to find new routes - and the way home. We
want to track our workout progress - pace, heart rate, and miles.  We'd like to listen to workout 
playlists, but earbuds are dangerous while biking. Answering
the phone or checking calls easily without stopping would be ideal. A third party GPS device, such as Garmin, is expensive, performs only
 one function, and is limited by
their software. It can't answer the phone; and it can't be customized. 
It doesn't work with your favorite biking
apps and your heart rate monitor. Wearables might work with your apps, 
but the screens - and their batteries - are way too small.  I waited for technology to adapt and work better for cyclists.  I 
searched for a product that combined all my needs in one place. I 
couldn't find one. Finally,
working with bike, auto and
motorcycle technology experts, I have the perfect cycling accessory. The Limelight Power Dock turns your bike into a smart bike and puts everything at your finger tips.

Limelight Story/Timeline






The idea-July 2015





The idea of a multi-functional bicycle audio device came from Mr. Zhang, a member of The Dream of Guangzhou Cycling Team, and a friend of our manufacturer. Mr. Zhang cycled with his team more than 500km across Malaysia in July 2015 to support the Beijing Olympic Winter Games at the scene of the International Olympic Committee’s 128th
session in Kuala Lumpur. The team also traveled to Europe to support the London
Olympic Games and cycled to the Korea to support the Incheon Asian Games. Their ongoing goal is to advocate a low carbon footprint through their cycling
activities. 
During these rides Mr. Zhang listened to MP3 music. Another team member asked to use the device to listen to radio, but Mr. Zhang's device was limited to playing MP3.  Mr. Zhang was intrigued with the idea of a more versatile device, and began researching various bike products. He found products that were just lights, others just speakers, and all were limited to few functions and not configurable.  The idea for the Limelight Power Dock was born. 
Your phone is more powerful than any wearable, is able to sync with Bluetooth (music, heart rate, cadence etc), is already configured with your favorite riding apps and is the most powerful computer available. It's the perfect brain behind the Limelight 
Your phone coupled with the power dock serves as a perfect touring computer. It has all the functions of your phone, GPS turn by turn directions, radio, music, internet, and adds a light, speakers to listen to music, radio or amplify calls and turn by turn directions. It has  a huge battery reserve to keep your phone going on those two day camping trips.
The manufacturer specializes in car, motorcycle and bike technology  used his expertise and experience to design the prototype.





The Indiegogo Launch  December 2015


My name is John Moubayed, I have been importing for 15 years, and I love to ride. On one of my recent trips to Hong Kong I found and fell in love with the Power Dock.  I often tour on my bike and have to stop for phone call, or need to pull out my phone for GPS directions. Always concerned about my battery, I used my GPS as I would a map. I'd pull it out for directions, then turn it off to conserve power.  But the need to have GPS visible and usable for extended periods of time was strong.  I never really considered a wearable because the battery life is poor as well.  The Limelight is perfect for a touring rider like me. 


If you like long rides to new places or weekend trips exploring multiple destinations, or if you are in a more urban setting with many quick turns,  the Limelight Power Dock is perfect. With GPS on, most phone batteries last less than half a day. If you are using GPS for extended periods,  or camping overnight, your battery simply will not last.  






The Power dock gives you 150% more battery life to get you through a second day. It can be removed from your bike to serve as a charging station, camp light, or speakers for entertainment no matter where you stop. 
 


I love to track my progress and speed with varying biking apps and for the fitness-focused your phone can pair with heart monitors as well. 


We are ready to bring this product to life.  We have tested the prototype and are making some minor modifications.   We expect to complete the modifications and production by our ship date in May 2016.


Ship Date-May 2016


Our Indiegogo campaign will end in early February. We expect about 90 days for production and shipping, and anticipate shipping to contributors around mid May.



Risks & Challenges


While we have experience in bringing products to life, manufacturing a new item can be difficult. We have tested the unit and some modifications have been made to the phone holder to allow for larger phones and cases and larger handlebars. These modifications require new molds and take time, which we have factored into our delivery date.  While we don't anticipate problems, it is possible that delivery gets pushed back a month. Should we get very large interest in the Power Dock delivery could also be pushed back due to excessive demand, but we will do a rolling delivery on a first ordered, first delivered basis. 


The Limelight Power Dock ships with mini USB cable to charge both Android phones and the Power Dock.  For i-Phone users your existing phone cords will work with USB out to charge your phones.

</div></div>","As Featured in         Technology has become our everyday environment.We all need it, but what is it that technology really needs? The answer’s simple: to be flexible, powerful, save energy and pollute less.That means no more wires, no more chargers and most importantly no more problems.Go on, admit it, you’re still dealing with a huge problem. Do you know that not much has changed in pretty much a century?Imagine a system that lets you simultaneously power and charge everything electronic you hold dear, that lets you use and charge your devices at the same time, that offers high speed charging.Look no further.                                                               JOS offers the chance to really improve your living and working spaces and save time.JOS is a freestanding energy surface, a lightweight steel panel containing powerful sockets enabling you to wirelessly charge all kinds of devices from smartphones to tablets, from cameras to small appliances. A new technology that simultaneously charges a number of devices on one smart powerful surface. It’s easy to use and you could save up to 15% more energy than with a traditional system.                      

Plug up to six JOS Domes into your Energy Surface to get high power charging.
Take your Dome with you when you’re on the go and use it as a Power Bank. Get rid of wires, declutter and organise your living and work spaces. Easy-to-use, practical and effective, JOS Dome improves your technological life. 






Fill your Energy Surface up with devices and take full advantage of JOS. 






                      

This is our PLUS for now. This is only the initial version of JOS. Helping this project you'll be supporting something much bigger. 
JOS is much more than a simple charging product. It’ s a new kind of socket and plug, a revolutionary technology which makes whole surfaces (like a table or a wall) capable of feeding with power greater than 100 W per connection point for all our devices, with an energy saving up to 15%.




This means: lighting systems, notebooks, appliances, managed at the same time, allowing removal, modification and replacement only with a touch of the hand, without cables and structural interventions.

JOS PANEL 




The first ever Energy Surface. An ultra-innovative charging system containing six high power sockets.
JOS Panel is a freestanding Energy Surface powered from your home electricity system. Each spot is a powerful socket where you can plug in and power your JOS Dome to charge your smartphone, tablet and much more.



JOS DOME
Charger & Power Bank




A new kind of plug. Use and charge your devices at the same time. 

Two versions available: Micro-USB/Lightning plug.  Micro USB & USB port. 
Easy charging with a touch of the hand.

JOS Dome is an ultra-innovative plug that quickly charges low voltage devices on your JOS Panel. It has a MICRO-USB plug for charging most smartphones and tablets or a Lightning Plug for Apple devices.


Each version has a USB socket for charging other low voltage devices using a different type of plug (meaning that each Dome can charge up to two devices at the same time) and a Micro USB socket so you can charge the Dome from your home electricity system or PC.


The Dome is also a Power Bank. Take it with you when you’re on the go and charge devices from the USB socket (you’ll need a USB cable) to ensure you’re never short on charge.




JOS NET



An ultra-light practical tool for charging tablets on the Dome. If you want to use your Dome on the go just take it off.
JOS Net is a useful accessory that helps you arrange your devices on the Panel.Its ergonomic and functional design holds the JOS Dome in place when you’re charging tablets and other large devices. It’s quick and easy to put on and off – all you have to do is click it in and out around the base of the Dome.



         CHOOSE YOUR FAVORITE COLOR & PLUG



                     


Titanium Skin

Black Dots

What’s great about the JOS Panel is not only can you customise how you arrange your devices, you can choose one of two textures (titanium skin / black dots) and ask us to engrave the steel surface with your favourite words, for instance your name, the name of your loved one or a phrase that means something to you.






                                  




                      










The button underneath the Dome turns on the LED light at the centre of the JOS logo. When the light is green the Power Bank is fully charged and good to go; when it’s red it needs charging, either on the Panel or from another source using a USB cable. 

    

Your Dome can be charged straight from the JOS Panel or from another energy source such as a notebook using a USB cable.





                        




A Spin Off of the University of Pisa, JOS Technology was founded in 2013. Since then we’ve taken part in lots of electronics shows and have won various awards. The feedback we’ve received has convinced us that our product needs to be simple, practical and useful.
Over the past two years we’ve invested in R&D, engineering and design. 
We’ve selected the best materials and developed the best techniques and now our product is nearly ready for market.
JOS is Made in Italy, designed and produced with care and passion, excellently manufactured and showcases quality Italian design.



                             



                       



Five years ago we had a flash of inspiration that has turned into JOS…                  
Just One System. We’ve worked really hard and created countless prototypes to provide the best usability and design inside a small practical device. We’re really excited about launching our product.
By helping launch this project you’ll be supporting something much bigger: JOS isn’t just a product but a real piece of innovative technology.
We want to provide a new standard.
Imagine a wall where dozens of notebooks, smartphones, lighting systems and much more can all be charged at the same time without sockets or cables, efficiently and quickly...
You’d be able to charge any device, move and change your energy surface with a touch of the hand… 
And you’d make an energy saving up to 15%, and you can use also photovoltaics.
By supporting JOS you will ensure that tomorrow we’ll find infinite charging points inside houses, offices and public spaces… without being tied to electrical outlets.
Be one of the first people to own a JOS!
Together let’s make JOS a reality.

Thank you.

JOS is a patented and tested system that has shown no particular technical or functional problems. Defects in the prototypes have been resolved by carefully engineering the panels to make them increasingly lighter and thinner. The plug connection has been made smaller and more efficient. The functionality of the system has been improved by integrating a Power Bank into the Dome.
By using technologically advanced machinery we’ll be able to get even better results in terms of shapes and sizing. It’s positive news in terms of certifications too: low voltage and made of ferromagnetic material, the system is passive and intrinsically benign. JOS is currently at the Beta prototype stage.
When you support us we guarantee to produce the best results. But as you know, a start-up’s journey can sometimes be arduous and there may well be some unexpected hiccups along the way. We promise to tell you everything that’s going on and do our very best to solve any problem that may arise.


JOS is much more than a simple charging product. It’ s a revolutionary technology which makes whole surfaces capable of feeding with power greater than 100 W per connection point for all our devices. 


This means: lighting systems, notebooks, appliances, managed at the same time, allowing removal, modification and replacement with a simple gesture, without structural interventions.

<p><strong>Stop Spending your Money</strong> on Inferior Cables!</p>
<p>You have probably heard the saying <u>""They don't make things like they used to!""</u> and for a lot of things this is true especially recently when it come to electronics.  The world is always trying to make things smaller, lighter, quicker, and cheaper.  Sometimes this results in a very flimsy low quality  product.  So Sly Kly Design decided to take charging/sync cables and change their status from a ""consumable"" to a product that will last you ""Forever"".</p>

</div></div>","Stop Spending your Money on Inferior Cables!
You have probably heard the saying ""They don't make things like they used to!"" and for a lot of things this is true especially recently when it come to electronics.  The world is always trying to make things smaller, lighter, quicker, and cheaper.  Sometimes this results in a very flimsy low quality  product.  So Sly Kly Design decided to take charging/sync cables and change their status from a ""consumable"" to a product that will last you ""Forever"".

 


 

 
Helix Cables protect the delicate wires and tips with Metal Armor.
 
The plastic coated copper wires are wrapped with a flat Stainless Steel Spring.
The molded connectors are housed in Aluminum to prevent crushing.

Chew Proof
Whether its your child or your pet that likes to gnaw on your cables its never a good thing for your plastic coated cable.
Helix Cables  can withstand almost all the abuse that your child or pet can throw at it.
Check out this video below where we played tug of war with Jax, a 60lb+ dog, using a Helix Cable.

The cable still works and doesn't even have a scratch on it.
I wouldn't dare try that with a plastic or fabric covered cable.
 
 

Say goodbye to tangled cables.

Helix Cables are Tangle Resistant and Hold a Nice Tight Wrap with Included Hook and Loop Strap.

See the animation below where Helix Cables Resists Knotting and Tangling. 
  
 

Helix Cables are Available in:
2 Different Lengths - 1 Meter (3 Feet) & 2 Meter (6 Feet)
3 Connector Types - Micro, Lightning, Type C

4 Metal Finishes - Silver, Gray, Black, & Rose Gold

 

Every Helix Cable is covered by a Limited Lifetime Warranty.
If your cable breaks or stops working from normal wear and tear, we’ll replace it.
Simply return the cable back to us and we will send you a replacement after inspecting the returned cable.
 

The white cables that come with popular cell phones quickly get dirty and become discolored.  The dirt they collect turns them brown and gray.  Over time they will also turn yellow from exposure to UV light or overheating.  

The finish on the metal of Helix Cables won't collect dirt and won't discolor when exposed to UV Light.

The Impact: Solving a Pain Point



 


 


Main Stream MediaMajor mainstream media contacts around the globe contact us on a weekly basis asking use for articles and TV shows. The list of outlets who have profiled the Kissenger to date includes:  Marketing also includes podcasts with various radio stations such as the BBC: http://emmayannzhang.com/kissenger-interview-on-bbc-world-service-radio/ Meet The Team What We Need & What You Get We would love you to join us on our journey to bring the product to life. We aim to raise $500,000 through our crowd funding campaign. We have a fully functioning physical model of the device which we have tested , leading to value engineering upgrades for the model we plan to put on the market. Funds raised will go directly to funding the final design phases, manufacturing of the units ordered through the crowd fund, and development of the full software stack. As early backers, we were keen to reward you with some unique perks. Our goal is to create 5,000 units, but if we do not meet that goal we will make the amount of units requested if we can meet our price points for a smaller batch. Otherwise we will return the money. Risks & ChallengesAt present, we have a fully functioning physical model of the device. We have identified a number of manufactures in Malaysia and China who could value engineer, up-design, produce and deliver the product once we have the funding in place. By working with these providers, we have significantly de-risked the process of bringing Kissenger to market. The manufacturers have experience building hand held devices which uses the same software and hardware in our product. We know this is an ambitious target but one which we truly believe is achievable. As such we will be providing our backers with regular updates on Kissenger's progress.  Other Ways You Can HelpWe would love you to join the Kissenger movement. We have set out a couple of ways for you, as backer, to help us. As any startup, we will have our hands full trying to get this product to market, and we are super excited about it. Helping spread the word on social media or telling colleagues or friends about our campaign would be like having fairy dust sprinkled on us! We would love to hear from you.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The FLEX Cable</strong><br/>At OOLi we began with research into ways to improve the ubiquitous charging cable. We then chose strong, yet flexible materials including Kevlar to enhance durability to cope with the riggers of our busy lifestyles. We discovered that the area most susceptible to breaking on a cable was where the rigid overmould and the cable meet, so we created the FlexiNeck which is made from a flexible rubberised plastic. The FlexiNeck spreads cable strain from a single point to a larger area, preventing the cable breaking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Grip</strong><br/>The Grip began as a simple cable tidy, but we quickly realised we could add an extra feature by making the Grip cable tidy heavier and giving it a rubberised finish to grip onto surfaces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The NORTHSOUTH Plug</strong><br/>Next we analysed where people were charging their phones. A recent survey* of over 9000 participants revealed that 76% of us charge our phone next to our beds at night. Wall sockets are often behind bedside cabinets in bedrooms so we took all of this into consideration and designed a plug that can be used behind furniture without putting strain on the charging cable, we called it the NORTHSOUTH Plug. Having a USB port on the top and the bottom of our plug means that furniture can sit flush with the plug, without putting strain on the cable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong><br/>Many of us had heard stories or seen news articles about sub-standard electronics causing fires and explosions, so safety was paramount to us and we took it very seriously, all of our plugs are tested by SGS - the worlds leading product safety tester. </p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCING THE OOLi RANGE The OOLi FLEX is a beautifully designed cable available in Micro USB / MFi Certified Apple Lightning options. The OOLi NORTHSOUTH plug has been designed from the ground up to reduce strain on USB cables - the main cause of cable failure. It has ergonomic and contemporary styling and works in a conﬁned space without forcing the cable in to an unnatural position.  _____________________________________________________________________________  THE PROBLEMThere are many common problems that occur when using charging cables and plugs.
 
 
 
_____________________________________________________________________________
 
 
THE SOLUTION: OOLi FLEX CABLE

 
___________
FLEXiNECK
The area most susceptible to damage on any cable is where the USB overmould and cable meet. The FlexiNeck distributes the area of stress from a single point to a larger area.

 
________________
STRONG CABLE
The OOLi FLEX cable features numerous strong yet flexible materials including DuPont Kevlar fibre. We believe in the quality and durability of this and therefore the OOLi FLEX cables come with a lifetime guarantee.

 
____________________________
ERGONOMIC CABLE HEADS
The head of the cable needs to be small, but on most cables they are not easy to grip. We added contours and a soft-touch rubberised finish to make it easier when connecting or disconnecting the cable to, or from a device

 
________________
EXTRA LENGTH
The OOLi FLEX cable is 2M in length which we feel is the optimal length for most uses around the house or at work.

 
__________
THE GRIP
The Grip is a multifunctional, rubberised weighted sphere. Thanks to a non slip finish, the Grip holds your USB cable in place when you’ve removed the OOLi FLEX cable from your device, ready for the next time it’s needed.


 
_____________________
STORING WITH GRIP
The Grip doubles as a cable tidy for transportation and storage. Its flexible mouth can be used to hold the coiled cable neatly in place.


 
 
______________
MOVING GRIP
The Grip’s position can be adjusted, up and down the cable to suit your charging needs. It can also be removed entirely if required.  


   _____________________________________________________________________________
 
 
THE SOLUTION: OOLi NORTHSOUTH PLUGS

 
______________________
NORTHSOUTH PORTS
The plug features two USB ports, one on the top and one on the bottom, allowing choice of charging position and simultaneous charging. Vertical orientation of the ports saves space behind furniture and reduces the likelihood of stress on the cable.

 
_____________________
ERGONOMIC CASING
The ergonomic grooves on the sides of the NORTHSOUTH plug were added to ease grip when pushing in to, or pulling out of wall sockets.

 
_______________________________
SMART CHARGE TECHNOLOGY
Our plugs also feature SmartCharge technology which guarentees safe electrical curents that won’t damage your devices’ batteries in the long term. It also ensures the devices connected are being charged at their maximum speed.

 
________
SAFETY
Safety is very important to us. That’s why all of our plugs are compliant with relevant safety standards in each country and tested by SGS - the worlds leading product safety tester. So you can be assured our products are tested to the highest standards.

TIMELINE

THE MAKING OF


 
The FLEX CableAt OOLi we began with research into ways to improve the ubiquitous charging cable. We then chose strong, yet flexible materials including Kevlar to enhance durability to cope with the riggers of our busy lifestyles. We discovered that the area most susceptible to breaking on a cable was where the rigid overmould and the cable meet, so we created the FlexiNeck which is made from a flexible rubberised plastic. The FlexiNeck spreads cable strain from a single point to a larger area, preventing the cable breaking. 
 
The GripThe Grip began as a simple cable tidy, but we quickly realised we could add an extra feature by making the Grip cable tidy heavier and giving it a rubberised finish to grip onto surfaces.
 
The NORTHSOUTH PlugNext we analysed where people were charging their phones. A recent survey* of over 9000 participants revealed that 76% of us charge our phone next to our beds at night. Wall sockets are often behind bedside cabinets in bedrooms so we took all of this into consideration and designed a plug that can be used behind furniture without putting strain on the charging cable, we called it the NORTHSOUTH Plug. Having a USB port on the top and the bottom of our plug means that furniture can sit flush with the plug, without putting strain on the cable.
 
SafetyMany of us had heard stories or seen news articles about sub-standard electronics causing fires and explosions, so safety was paramount to us and we took it very seriously, all of our plugs are tested by SGS - the worlds leading product safety tester.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We at Party-Hunt are developers who've built an open platform for hosting live-music concerts and parties around Goa, India. </p>
<p>When we ourselves were on the lookout for great parties, we found it very hard to look for specific genres and events anywhere on the popular platforms. Hence we thought of creating an open platform where events would be arranged based on location and genre and people could look for just the thing they wanted. </p>
<p>There was a big lack of awareness about various great events that we wanted travellers coming to Goa to visit. An online platform that would host all verified events, down to the intricate details like genre and entry fee was the best way to move forward.</p>
<p>Also a lot of big parties were already hosted on popular platforms and were attracting a lot of tourists at whose cost smaller bars and restaurants were suffering. So we thought that every venue must be given some online exposure to tell the world what they're playing tonight. This was how it all began.</p>
<p>Music is Goa's spirit. Everyone has a different definition of what calms and relaxes them and people come to Goa for that reason. Empowering the much less known venues and bringing the spirit of Goa online is our mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>All the efforts till now have been self funded. We're proud to announce that we've reached a point where a good number of people use our application and we need a workforce to market and manage everything during the party season. </p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 25k USD asked, roughly 10k will be used to pay videographers, content writers and a developer intern from the period of August 2019 till March 2020. We at Party Hunt, being developers ourselves, ensure the donors that every hiring will be done keeping equal opportunity and no discrimination guidelines in mind. We seek to build a diverse team with a similar vision.</li>
<li>10k is to be put into use for aggressive marketing just before the peak Party season. Printing of banners, </li>
<li>5k and some of our own funds are being labelled as infrastructure funds. We're renting an office space in Arambol. We seek to buy equipments and begin an independent ArtistConnect venture which shall provide talented local artists and DJs a platform to showcase their music to our partner venues. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We come to this platform because we intend to make our application a sustainable venture away from the world of investments and advertisements.</p>
<p>Our potential donor is an upcoming Goa traveller that understands the need of knowing the best places and not wasting resources in a places that may not catch their vibe. Someone that wants to explore the best of Goa based on what travellers with identical stories recommend. There is a big requirement of a strong community driven music guidance and we are bent on making the perfect platform for it.</p>
<p>Our ideal donor is someone that has a close connection to music. Someone that knows what the right music with the right environment can do to us emotional beings and why places like Goa where people from around the world come to de-stress themselves thrive.</p>
<p>Our potential donor is also someone who realises how important technology is for smaller businesses and believes open platforms and assistance for them are essential for healthy competition and local sustainability to thrive in today's world where tourists have pre booked almost everything before they even visit the place.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>The next version of our application has a ""Shoutout to our Donors"" page. Please do check out our Perks section for knowing more about our T-shirt and mugs giveaways. We intend to keep a personal connection with those who want to power us. You get exclusive passes to any partner venue if you are an Indian national, or are in India at the time. One top International donor will be extended our hospitality in Goa just before the last big party of the season and get to meet the team they've supported.</p>

<h4><b>Netedex is a smart business card</b></h4>

<p>Netedex
has security features in place to ensure you and your privacy are protected at
all times.</p>
<p>Netedex makes
networking and passing on contact details a breeze.</p>
<p>Netedex
is updating the way we use business cards by employing secure, personalised,
business card technology so we can finally carry just one card in order to pass
our details on time and time again. </p>
<p>Netedex
cards can be for personal use too, passing on your contact details and your
Social Media links all with a tap of your card.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Why Netedex?</b></h2>
<p><b>Netedex

a seamless contact management system that updates contact information via a
mobile application - Just simply edit the contact details within our app and
your contacts will automatically be provided with the updated information. </p>
<p>Netedex

Netedex</b></h2><div><b><br/></b></div>
<h3><b>How does Netedex work? </b></h3>
<p>Because sharing our
contacts allows us to connect with people everywhere, we make sure that you
never miss an opportunity or miss a chance to connect. </p>
<p>Netedex gives every businessperson
the opportunity to exchange details quickly and easily, making sure you never
miss the key moment to connect. </p>
<p>Users simply tap their
business card on a smart device, and the Netedex app exchanges their contact
details. During the sync between Netedex and your smartphone, the contact
details of the other person are sent back to you. </p>

<p>The truth is that we
often give out or take business cards, leave them in our pockets, or an old
wallet or even a business card holder, and forget about them. The task of
transferring new contact details to your smartphone is laborious and time
consuming. It’s time we had a ‘smarter’ way to manage contact information and
keep it updated.

Vision </b></h2>
<p>At
Netedex we understand the importance of contact management and the relevance of
business cards in business today. If you’ve ever lost a valuable card, or had a
contact change their position or contact details, then Netedex is a simple and smart
solution for you. </p>
<p>Our
vision is to improve the way we all network, connect and essentially do
business, using available technologies to provide a much needed system for our digitally
enhanced lives. </p>
<p>To
provide a sustainable method for business development and interaction, contact
management and smart communication is our primary goal. </p>
<p>We
believe that a paperless system is sustainable, unlike other smart business cards,
that print millions of paper based cards incorporating USB’s and QR codes or
even chips, is not sustainable for the long term. </p>
<p>We also
believe in giving back and paying it forward – 5% of our profit will always be
donated to charity, which may be a current crisis or a suggested charity of our
customer’s choice. </p>
<p>By
meeting a real need that has been identified by business people around the
world, we believe that we can make a difference in a small but significant way
– so why not support us in our vision and help us to improve lives everywhere. </p>

<p>Welcome to X<i> of Stock</i>. We're a couple of young men from the San Luis Valley, a small rural community lacking much opportunity. That’s why we decided to create our own. Together we came up with the idea to create an all in one cable that not only charges but connects all your devices.  We see the removal of the headphone jack beginning in newer smartphones and we know the inconvenience of having additional adapters and cables to carry. Our creation would eliminate the need of purchasing anything additional because our cable would have the ability to adapt to you!  We were tired of the mess and inconvenience that came with the separate cables for all of your other devices too! This nuisance birthed the concept of the Multi-Verse Cable! The most innovative cable that’s works for all of your mobile devices!  </p>
<p>Early contributors to our campaign are essential for us to get our idea of the ground. We need funds to create our prototype, once done then we can put our cable into production. We also need input from these contributors. We plan on sending early models of the cable to a select few of our founding donors so they can provide feedback! Together we can create the ultimate cable!</p>
<p>We’re going to need to raise $25,000 in order to get our prototype created and marketed online, and introduced at trade shows. </p>
<p>We don’t have a set collection of perks quite yet but here is what we are thinking right now. Contributors of at least ($200.00) or more will qualify for a special partnership with <i>X of Stock! </i>The <i>foundation</i> contributors will have a huge voice on how we carry out our campaign for the Multi-Verse Cable! In addition they will get all of the following lesser perks for their contributions. Contributors of at least ($100.00) will be entered in a drawing to be considered to receive early prototypes of the Multi-Verse Cable, in order to send us some feedback!  Contributors of at least ($60.00) will receive the deluxe package of the Multi-Verse Cable once it has hit production!</p>
<p>We will have to reach our goal in order use any of the money donated to us. We have it set up like this to avoid any issues we could face when it comes to returning our funds if we for some reason, cannot follow through with our promises.</p>
<p>Our cable will be an asset to anyone with a mobile device, which means nearly everyone. These days’ people have so many devices for so many things. This means everybody has a lot of cables as well. All that means is more clutter. The Multi-Verse cable is an advancement in technology and convenience. No matter who you are or what you do, it would make things just that much easier only having to keep track of one cord for all of your devices!</p>
<p>We have never done anything like this before, but we are eager and hungry to get work! With our determination and the support from you guys, we can bring our creation to fruition. We’re just two guys who are passionate helping people and making a difference in the world. It’s going to be tough for us to start our company and get the Multi-Verse Cable going but with everyone’s help I’m confident we will succeed.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles we face with creating the Multi-Verse cable is separating it from other products that may seem similar. We truly believe that the Multi-Verse Cable would be the most superior product of its kind, It would have many more features that our competition may have overlooked or ignored.  We also must admit this is our first time launching a campaign.</p>
<p>Don’t think that just because you’re unable to make a monetary contribution now, that you can’t contribute in other ways! The important thing here is, we need help with getting this idea out there and seen by everyone tired of all their cables! If you have any interest in the Multi-Verse Cable, and you would like it to become a reality, or if you just feel bad for us, SHARE our campaign!  Also, we need EVERYONE to follow all of our social media pages, and check out our website!</p>

<h3>Faster Charging than Ever</h3>
<p>USB-C Power Delivery is the most cutting-edge fast-charging standard. Built for speed, this port charges your MacBook, tablet, smartphone, and more in times that were previously impossible. The 30W port can charge an iPhone 8  up to 3 times faster than its own charger, and a Nintendo Switch at full speed.</p>

<p>The quickest way to charge countless smartphones. Up to 4X faster than their own chargers. Wait less and do more.</p>

<p>*There are no ties between “The Northface” company and Piiirs, this display is just for presentational use and visual support.</p>

<h3>Oh..Interesting</h3>
<p>How did Piiirs get started? </p>
<p>A year ago i was cycling along the Rhein river in Cologne. A sporty couple on their bikes were riding next to me and we started an interesting conversation while riding. Once i got home i was frustrated that we didn't exchange any contacts. I would have really enjoyed to meet them again go cycling together or simply grab a beer in the city.</p>
<p>In that moment the idea of Piiirs was created. There should be services out there that use technology and enable us to create meaningful connections in real life. To contact everyone we have passed by today in order to expand our personal and business circle, where ever we go. That is the core idea of Piiirs. More Meaningful Connections in real life through technology. An app that adds endless opportunities to our daily routine and enables us to find and meet our peer groups, any where and any time. </p>
<p>Back to the sporty couple. Through pure coincidence we three meet again, went on many cycling trips together and have become great friends. </p>
<h3>Why do we need Piiirs</h3>
<p>A study found that high social media use is linked to the feelings of social isolation, the more time people spend on social media sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. A perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically. </p>
<p>Using technology to enable us to cultivate meaningful connections in real life is a<br/>powerful approach to reduce human loneliness and negative emotions. Piiirs uses<br/>technology to bring us all closer together, share exciting adventures with interesting people in REAL LIFE. </p>
<p>I believe a future where we can connect to the interesting people who pass us every day in a respectful way is infinitely more exciting and inspiring than one where we can't. </p>
<ul>
<li>We believe in People, Life as an Adventure and services that do Good</li>
<li>The goal is to create tech that enables us to build bridges and not walls, in real life</li>
<li>Real people, meaningful connections, real adventures in real life</li>
</ul>

*There are no ties between “The Northface” company and Piiirs, this display is just for presentational use and visual support.

Oh..Interesting
How did Piiirs get started? 
A year ago i was cycling along the Rhein river in Cologne. A sporty couple on their bikes were riding next to me and we started an interesting conversation while riding. Once i got home i was frustrated that we didn't exchange any contacts. I would have really enjoyed to meet them again go cycling together or simply grab a beer in the city.
In that moment the idea of Piiirs was created. There should be services out there that use technology and enable us to create meaningful connections in real life. To contact everyone we have passed by today in order to expand our personal and business circle, where ever we go. That is the core idea of Piiirs. More Meaningful Connections in real life through technology. An app that adds endless opportunities to our daily routine and enables us to find and meet our peer groups, any where and any time. 
Back to the sporty couple. Through pure coincidence we three meet again, went on many cycling trips together and have become great friends. 
Why do we need Piiirs
A study found that high social media use is linked to the feelings of social isolation, the more time people spend on social media sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. A perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically. 
Using technology to enable us to cultivate meaningful connections in real life is apowerful approach to reduce human loneliness and negative emotions. Piiirs usestechnology to bring us all closer together, share exciting adventures with interesting people in REAL LIFE. 
I believe a future where we can connect to the interesting people who pass us every day in a respectful way is infinitely more exciting and inspiring than one where we can't. 

We believe in People, Life as an Adventure and services that do Good
The goal is to create tech that enables us to build bridges and not walls, in real life
Real people, meaningful connections, real adventures in real life

are also reducing waste. The final product has no finishing layer, it doesn’t
need one.</p>

<p>Did

<p>When you’re always on the go and usually charge your phone or tablet with a laptop or PC in the office or an USB port in the car, have you noticed that charging this way takes a really long time? And it’s almost impossible to actually increase your phone’s battery power if you’re using it as a GPS even while your phone is plugged in into your car's USB port; that's because your phone is using more power than the power your USB port can supply to your phone.  </p>

<p>Regular USB cables are made to communicate (transfer data) and to act as a power supply between your USB port and your device simultaneously.</p>

<p>When you connect your device (i.e. phone, table, etc.) to your USB port (on your laptop or in your car), the port automatically changes to sync/charge mode providing limited power because it's attempting to sync <b>AND</b> charge at the same time. Simply put, attempting to transfer data and charge at the same time is the main reason why charging is so slow.</p>

<h3><b>No more switches!</b></h3>The original <b>DouBBleTime</b> cable had a switch near the device plug that would turn on <b>DouBBleTime</b> charging while cutting off data communication between your device and your computer. (DCP Mode) An LED light would let you know that Dedicated Charging was turned on and data sync with your PC was turned off.

</div></div>","Do you remember DouBBleTime from our Kickstarter campaign launched in May of 2014?It was the world's first charging cable with a built-in switch that allowed double the charging speed of a regular cable when plugged into a USB device or car port.With $98,376 in funds raised worldwide, we received a lot of recognition for our hard work. Following us, there were a few copycats here and there that also did funding campaigns and were quite successful. With slight modification to our original design, others were able to piggyback on our idea and did a great job of it. So we decided to come out with an upgraded version and dub it DouBBleTime Plus and launch it on Indiegogo.
Why should you use DouBBleTime?

When you’re always on the go and usually charge your phone or tablet with a laptop or PC in the office or an USB port in the car, have you noticed that charging this way takes a really long time? And it’s almost impossible to actually increase your phone’s battery power if you’re using it as a GPS even while your phone is plugged in into your car's USB port; that's because your phone is using more power than the power your USB port can supply to your phone.  



Regular USB cables are made to communicate (transfer data) and to act as a power supply between your USB port and your device simultaneously.

When you connect your device (i.e. phone, table, etc.) to your USB port (on your laptop or in your car), the port automatically changes to sync/charge mode providing limited power because it's attempting to sync AND charge at the same time. Simply put, attempting to transfer data and charge at the same time is the main reason why charging is so slow.




No more switches!The original DouBBleTime cable had a switch near the device plug that would turn on DouBBleTime charging while cutting off data communication between your device and your computer. (DCP Mode) An LED light would let you know that Dedicated Charging was turned on and data sync with your PC was turned off. Turning data sync off allowed for double the charging speed because all input/output was being dedicated strictly for charging no matter what port you were using (PC, car, etc.)
DouBBleTime Plus enhances our original design by getting rid of the clunky switch design while still charging your device at twice the speed AND allowing data synchronization at the same time with your PC. If you take a close look at the new cable design above, you'll notice that the switch is no longer there. 

Charge your device at twice the speed, all the time, and sync your data too!












DouBBleTime EL adds a new feature to our original cable design by adding an LED strip down the entire cable letting you know when DCP mode has been turned on. The switch for DouBBleTime EL has been moved from the cable and added to the USB charging plug for a more simplistic and cleaner design.
The moving LED strip has been added along the cable to allow easy visibility of your cable in the dark and letting you know that your device is being charged and the switch has been turned on. The switch was left on so that the new LED strip would not always be running when charging your device and you can decide when and when not to charge your device in DouBBleTime.

DouBBleTime Plus and DouBBleTime EL are equipped with new features that enhance the comfort and convenience of DouBBleTime. 



With DouBBleTime Plus, you no longer have to check whether to see if DouBBletime charging is turned on. DouBBleTime charging is on all the time and the LED simply shows you that it's working. Even though your device will be charging at double the speed, data sync will STILL work and will not harm your devices battery.

Will the cable only work for Apple products?


Good news! DouBBleTime Charging Cable works for both Apple AND Android devices!


Will the cable be certified by apple to work on all devices?


We are using MFi approved components to manufacture our product. This way, our cable is as genuine as the one that comes with the iphone. You will not receive messages like, 'This accessory is not certified.


How long is the cable?
The DouBBleTime Charging Cable is 40"" long.

We are originally from Chelyabinsk (Russia), which became famous in 2013 after the meteorite fall :) We work in the Hong Kong company selling plastic devices worldwide. In 2014 we decided to produce a portable family-friendly mixer. We created the prototype of the mixer and the design, which is connected with space of course! Then we made the trial batch. At this stage we need financial funding to start mass production, that's why we need the support of our fascinating backers. <p></p>

TIMELINE

TEAM

We are originally from Chelyabinsk (Russia), which became famous in 2013 after the meteorite fall :) We work in the Hong Kong company selling plastic devices worldwide. In 2014 we decided to produce a portable family-friendly mixer. We created the prototype of the mixer and the design, which is connected with space of course! Then we made the trial batch. At this stage we need financial funding to start mass production, that's why we need the support of our fascinating backers.

<p>You might have heard that many messenger apps encrypt your data today. But truth is, they will give it out in decrypted form to any third party once requested. Same happens with all applications that claim to encrypt your calls.</p>
</div>The essential part of Zero is that voice gets into your phone <u>already encrypted</u>, so it doesn’t matter whether your smartphone records something or not, or someone attempts to intercept . No one will be able to decrypt it.</div></div>

<p>Primarily Zero Concierge will come in handy for commercial and business affairs, but also can be useful by ordinary people for keeping confidentiality of their personal conversations. We did not develop Zero Concierge for assistance in shady deeds, indeed we are absolutely against such activities, but we believe that in times of total surveillance people should be able to protect their privacy. That’s why we decided to build Zero.</p>
<p>Here are some things you protect when you secure your voice calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>your personal data such as bank account info, card numbers, contact info</li>
<li>your personal safety, such as information about where you’ll be at a certain time</li>
<li>confidential organizational or business information</li>
<li>sensitive medical information and records</li>
<li>confidential relationships, like conversations with doctors or counselors<br/> </li>
</ul>

<p>We made the use of Zero Concierge easy and convenient. That's how it looks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Zero mobile or desktop application, create connections with your interlocutors.</li>
<li>Connect Zero as a headset via Bluetooth or Jack-Jack, and make a call by phone or VOIP</li>
<li>Select your interlocutor’s name on the Zero’s screen</li>
<li>Indication on the screen will prove that the connection is securely protected</li>
</ul>
<p>If desired, you can update secret keys in your app, add new contacts, change the names and edit already existing contacts.</p>

<p>Zero should be charged via USB.</p>
<p>Zero can be connected to your calling device by two means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack to Jack: securely connects to a calling device via standard Jack to Jack 3.5 mm cable</li>
<li>Bluetooth: securely connects to a calling device via Bluetooth</li>
</ul>

<p>For quick and easy creation and  transfer of secret keys we have developed proprietary Zero applications for computers and smartphones.

<p>While transporting the keys from device to device, Zero uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Diffie-Hellman Cryptographic Protocol</a>, which provides high level of protection and allows you to generate a secret key using unprotected line even before the installation of a secure connection. For greater security, the keys can be updated unlimitedly, as well as be deleted and created again.</p>

<p>We have made it possible to configure key exchange and connections between devices both online (via the Internet) and offline when you connect two devices to a single computer. The first method is useful if the other person has his own Zero and is in a different location. The second way is if you have two Zero devices together.</p>
<p>When you buy Zero, you also get a code to download all versions of our applications.</p>

<p>We need to collect $100K for the commencement of commercial production. After receiving the funds, we will cover the production of the first series of Zero devices, and set our mates in China to start the manufacturing. Our experience shows that manufacturing and assembly can take about 2-3 months, after which the ordered device can be sent to backers</p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo</h3>
<p>We need investment for the industrial manufacture of Zero.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559153883/wlv0nziqknqzpjzejvat.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We already have a fully working prototype of the devices, software and contact management tool for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. We conducted the necessary testing, and developed plans for further development.</p>
<p>At all the development stages of Zero Concierge to current date, we have invested our own funds in the production. We have conducted a lot of research and tests, tried different versions and configurations, tuned the parameters for high-quality work of Zero Concierge. During the process of development, we have created dozens of prototypes. Finally, we have made and configured fully working prototypes ready for manufacturing. To start it, we need additional investment.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Since we already have the finished prototypes that are fully working, we do not have any risks associated with the production of devices. <br/>Our goal is the manufacturing, set in China. We've already produced the gadgets in China, and we have the proven manufacturers there. <br/>As for the risks - we can mention the following: </p>
<ul><li> The delivery itself may be slightly delayed because of the production terms of chinese factories or breaks of postal services. </li></ul>

Zero Concierge provides deep encryption of conversation, and in case of interception your speech will sound for attackers as something indiscriminate. We call this...



 
You might have heard that many messenger apps encrypt your data today. But truth is, they will give it out in decrypted form to any third party once requested. Same happens with all applications that claim to encrypt your calls.
The essential part of Zero is that voice gets into your phone already encrypted, so it doesn’t matter whether your smartphone records something or not, or someone attempts to intercept . No one will be able to decrypt it.


So you can talk over GSM networks, Viber, Skype or any VOIP and landline phone without fear of interception. 

Primarily Zero Concierge will come in handy for commercial and business affairs, but also can be useful by ordinary people for keeping confidentiality of their personal conversations. We did not develop Zero Concierge for assistance in shady deeds, indeed we are absolutely against such activities, but we believe that in times of total surveillance people should be able to protect their privacy. That’s why we decided to build Zero.
Here are some things you protect when you secure your voice calls:

your personal data such as bank account info, card numbers, contact info
your personal safety, such as information about where you’ll be at a certain time
confidential organizational or business information
sensitive medical information and records
confidential relationships, like conversations with doctors or counselors 



We made the use of Zero Concierge easy and convenient. That's how it looks:

Using Zero mobile or desktop application, create connections with your interlocutors.
Connect Zero as a headset via Bluetooth or Jack-Jack, and make a call by phone or VOIP
Select your interlocutor’s name on the Zero’s screen
Indication on the screen will prove that the connection is securely protected

If desired, you can update secret keys in your app, add new contacts, change the names and edit already existing contacts.

Zero should be charged via USB.
Zero can be connected to your calling device by two means:

Jack to Jack: securely connects to a calling device via standard Jack to Jack 3.5 mm cable
Bluetooth: securely connects to a calling device via Bluetooth

Below you will find more information about the difference between them.


For quick and easy creation and  transfer of secret keys we have developed proprietary Zero applications for computers and smartphones. We already have software for Windows and Mac, Android and iOS. Before the first use, this smart software will help you synchronize your contacts and establish encrypted connection with your mates who also use Zero Concierge.

While transporting the keys from device to device, Zero uses Diffie-Hellman Cryptographic Protocol, which provides high level of protection and allows you to generate a secret key using unprotected line even before the installation of a secure connection. For greater security, the keys can be updated unlimitedly, as well as be deleted and created again.
Zero application has the protection against attacks such as ""man-in-the-middle"" that gives additional guarantee of security.

We have made it possible to configure key exchange and connections between devices both online (via the Internet) and offline when you connect two devices to a single computer. The first method is useful if the other person has his own Zero and is in a different location. The second way is if you have two Zero devices together.
When you buy Zero, you also get a code to download all versions of our applications.

We started working on Zero four years ago, and most of the time was devoted to create reliable algorithms.

In the meantime, we have produced a large number of different versions of the devices, and conducted lots of testings to improve the quality of speech intelligibility.

We offer the Zero device for an affordable price for any person to use at home or for work.

It is unlikely that you will find similar devices in terms of format and price on the market. Those competitors who attempted to make something similar before to us, did not fulfil promises and timeframes. We already have completed prototypes, ready for industrial production.

Our team consists of high level experts in IT and electronics. We are engineers, schematics and PCB designers, software programmers, designers, mobile engineers and algorithm developers. Our company is based in Montenegro, although we a truly global company with employees in the USA and Europe.

You can buy Zero in the following packaging:

One Zero (remember, that your calling partner will also need to have a Zero in order to establish a secure call with you);
Double pack with two devices;
4x pack of Zeros for 4 persons.

We offer special Indiegogo 50% off prices. After this campaign ends, you won't be able to find Zero for such a low price, so hurry up! :)
We also offer limited super Early Bird deals for our first backers in order to appreciate your support. We need it in order to make this project successful!

Shipping and return policy
We are shipping worldwide. When ordering devices to your country, please find out whether the use of such devices is permitted by national law. Moreover, remember that due to the varying import regulations, there may be import duty to pay.
Considering return policy, in the unfortunate case that we don’t meet our campaign goal, all contributions will be fully refunded. 


We need to collect $100K for the commencement of commercial production. After receiving the funds, we will cover the production of the first series of Zero devices, and set our mates in China to start the manufacturing. Our experience shows that manufacturing and assembly can take about 2-3 months, after which the ordered device can be sent to backers
 
Why Indiegogo
We need investment for the industrial manufacture of Zero.

We already have a fully working prototype of the devices, software and contact management tool for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. We conducted the necessary testing, and developed plans for further development.
At all the development stages of Zero Concierge to current date, we have invested our own funds in the production. We have conducted a lot of research and tests, tried different versions and configurations, tuned the parameters for high-quality work of Zero Concierge. During the process of development, we have created dozens of prototypes. Finally, we have made and configured fully working prototypes ready for manufacturing. To start it, we need additional investment.
Risks and challenges
Since we already have the finished prototypes that are fully working, we do not have any risks associated with the production of devices. Our goal is the manufacturing, set in China. We've already produced the gadgets in China, and we have the proven manufacturers there. As for the risks - we can mention the following: 
 The delivery itself may be slightly delayed because of the production terms of chinese factories or breaks of postal services.",29.0,1,"1 Campaign

Patent Pending  We have more than 5 years developing and manufacturing tablets, smartphones and power banks as we distribute them to all Latin America and part in the United States. All of our distributors and clients give faith that our products are good quality. We have passed all lab tests in different retail chain like Walmart. Because we are a new brand in the market we are committed to bring high quality products to the consumers and we will always keep this promise since we love it that way. The M-Charger advanced will also have that same high quality end to meet the expectations of all backers and consumers that believed in this project.   RewardsWe added this first stretch goal to thank to all our backers for their support and pledges. After we reach this goal and the campaign ends all backers would be able to choose among 3 different colors of a velvet case for their M-Charger Advanced.​ Elegant Black​ Electric Purple Lightning Blue Team M-ChargerTeam Artex We take our projects as serious as they can be and we love to work hard because we are committed to our customers to deliver the goods in the time and date we promised. That’s why since now we will brew a lot of coffee and work harder every night and every day to bring this product to the hands of the backers and our customers according to our time line as always do.Working HardIt seems worth mentioning - our price is realistic, the margins are small, and we need your support to order a large enough quantity of parts to make this possible - but we will deliver and we'll deliver something that works and works well! We can't! Making a high quality, charger solution at this price point takes large minimum orders and custom tooling - we' invested a great deal into this, and will invest much more, but we need your help to meet these minimum quantities and get started on full production! Time Line Risks and ChallengesDeveloping a product from scratch entails many challenges as many details have to be taken into account as the materials that make up the product, as well as the quality tests necessary to ensure that the product we deliver to users is faithful and works properly. It is important to say that in the development process it is necessary to be able to comply with all the regulations and licenses required so that the product can meet the requirements that all countries require in terms of quality and good operation. Because it's a product that works with AC we must issue the necessary licenses like FCC, CE, RoHs, UL, MFI, among others. This means that we must depend on the times of third parties to be able to obtain all these necessary licenses so that the users can be sure that the product that is going to replace their wall charger works correctly. In addition our reliable manufacturers also have their manufacturing times and quality tests which leads us to have to be aware that the times can be fulfilled in order to be able to deliver the product on time. However on the way some delays could arise which may lead us to send the M-Charger Advanced with some delay in the dates we had already promised. However as an experienced company, we are going to do our best to ship in the set dates.",34.0,1,"1 Campaign

After three years, I succeeded in developing software that met my demanding requirements.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129260/files/20150103115916-IMG_0353_v2.jpg?1420315156"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129261/files/20150103115932-2015-01-03_20.56.30_v2.jpg?1420315172"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>2. The goal of the campaign</b><br/></p><p>The goal of this campaign is to create software that will make a smartphone a substitute for a laptop or a desktop computer. Today’s smartphones are very efficient and, in the near future, will become even more efficient, having greater storage capacity; thus, it is certain that, sooner or later, smartphones will become portable mini-computers while still maintaining their function as mobile phones. Even today, it is possible to download applications for smartphones allowing sound, video, or picture editing and viewing and editing documents of any kind.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130305/files/20150104043752-PC-Excel.jpg?1420375072"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>3. How it works</b></p><p>It is very simple! As shown in the video, for a wired connection (via a cable), all you need to do is insert your phone into a docking device; within seconds you can use your phone as a desktop computer – on the screen, you will see all programs adapted (size and interface) for use with external monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  In this way, you can create texts, tables, surf the internet, and do many other things that you do on your PC or laptop. After disconnecting, simply take your phone out of the docking device and you can instantly use it as you are used to.  </p><p>For a wireless connection (without a cable), all you need to do is click on a specific icon on your phone  and it will connect to a television where you can use the internet, play games, watch movies, view photos, listen to MP3 files – your phone can easily become a multimedia centre. With a wireless connection, it is also possible to use all functions of your phone as with a wired connection.  To disconnect, simply click on the icon. </p><p>If you would like to know more, please see the “How it works (a version for advanced users)” section. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130317/files/20150104044928-Wireless-XBMC-video-Upraven.jpg?1420375768"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130364/files/20150104052332-Phone-XBMC_fixed_.jpg?1420377812"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>4.

What can the application be used for</b></p><p>a)	For managers – people who often travel and stay in hotels on business trips have to carry their laptop with them so that they can create graphs, presentations and other documents, but soon a smartphone could be the only device needed. In the future, every better hotel would be equipped with a universal docking station, a keyboard and mouse included. Managers would then simply insert their phone into the docking device and could instantly work on their documents. This is advantageous mainly because people would not have to carry their laptops and chargers with them as they always carry their phone with them.</p><p>b)	For businessmen – you could use a single device for work and home alike.  Nowadays, smartphones have many applications that are comparable to programs on an ordinary PC (for example video cutting apps, photo editing apps etc.). The main advantage is that you would not have to buy a special computer for work or carry your laptop with you every day.</p><p>c)	For normal people – firstly, a smartphone can be used as a multimedia centre, enabling you to watch movies, listen to music, or surf the internet on a big TV. Secondly, it can be used as a substitute for a normal PC; if you do not need really high performance, a smartphone connected as a desktop PC should be a sufficient device for general working activities. There already exist many programs that have the same functions as the programs that you are used to on your PC or laptop. The main advantage is that you can save money by not buying a multimedia centre or a new computer, and, instead, change your old smartphone for a new one when needed. In this way, you can save a lot of money. </p><p>d)	Tablets with a keyboard and touchpad (with phone operation system sometimes looking like a laptop) will be able to be used as a normal laptop – currently, it is unfortunately not the case; when using these tablets, the only thing you get is the feeling of a bigger screen comparing to the phone. </p><p>e)	Nowadays, it is cheaper to produce phones than computers. If somebody began producing devices on a mobile platform, it would be possible to produce cheap computers, which could be used by poor children throughout the world. </p><p>f)	Other options are unlimited; for example, there could be docking cafes which would provide for their visitors monitors, keyboards, mice, and Wi-Fi connection so that they would need only their own phone. This could be applied anywhere else – for example in libraries, in companies for employees and business partners’ presentations, etc. </p><p><b>Do not forget that your phone is always with you, unlike your laptop or computer! </b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130321/files/20150104045225-PC-Wikipedia-Indiegogo.JPG?1420375945"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>6.

What do I need money for?</b></p><p>To create software that will work on all phones is quite a difficult and expensive thing. There are four ways of implementing this project.</p><p>1)	The software will be accessible only to phones with ROOT access (phones that are modified with a special program enabling users to make changes on their phone; this modification must be done by users themselves). The advantage of this is that I will need only a good programming team for creating the software. The disadvantage is that the software will be restricted only to users with phones with root access.</p><p>2)	The software will be accessible to everyone, but all software producers (producers of any program or application that people would like to use after connecting to an external monitor) will have to add a new user interface to their programs, thanks to which the programs will have a different appearance on a phone and after connecting to an external monitor or TV.

May: Production prototyping, moulds and first samples. 
June: production modifications and packaging design. 
July: production 
September: reception and distribution of goods.

Even the EarPods sells with iphone 7 is using lightening connector, Which means you even can’t use ” Apple EarPods” with its own laptop without an adopter.To use the MacBook Pro as we expected, well, obviously we need a lot of adaptors, or a ports hub.I’m introducing you – Hub 3.0 .First Generation of HubHave you experienced this? All cables twines eachother together, Ruins your whole days good mood within a second. These ” Simple Adaptors” could be considered as the first generation of Hub. One adaptor for one port. In everyday life we need different outputs, then you need many adaptors, USB, HDMI, Net Cable, SD card reader…..It hard to pick a needed one in that kind of cable mess, which always drive you crazy and mess everything up together.First generation of HubSecond Generation of HubThe second generation of Hub is ""dock"". It Has almost all the functions you need, looks nice, but when you actually start to use it with your macbook, it will ruin your laptop's most expansive feature: portability. It’s sooo huge! And the point is, you barely use all the different poats at a same time, which means most of the space and the weight is actually wasted at the time. You only need a Hub which is easy to carry and meet your needs when you need it, not a brick even bigger than your phone.When you choose MacBook, you choose to have a really efficient life, Efficient working or creating experience. The Hub should provide you what you need, and nothing should be surplus or wasted. Then here comes The FruitHub, Hub 3.0. 

FruitHub is the world’s first modular USB-C Hub that helps you expanding your MacBook or MacBook Pro. By changing the blocks you can easily connect your MakBook or MacBook Pro to Lightening, Net Cable, HDMI, USB cables and SD Card. The soft light on the fruit shows which part is standby at the time, helping you recognize the ports with no effort in an emotional and friendly way.You can change the blocked according to different occasions, and by chaning the order og the blocks, you will get all ports that are frequently used . The FruitHub is highly flexiable and totoally efficient based on it’s  design idea. Nothing is wasted, and nothing is lost.By changing the blocks, you can get ports from one lightening and a USB to 5 different frequently used ports, and you always get an extra USB port in additional.You will the service you need based on different occasions. For example, you are listening beautiful music using your Lightnening earpods, and going to have a presentation, just stick the Mango block(“Mango” for “Media”)into the Zero part, then show your presentation to others concentratively and efficiently. If you plan to go picnic with family and take some memorable pictures, stick the strawberry block (“Strawberry” for SD card) into Zero part, then you can view and polish your photos at the very same time. The FruitHub provides you what you need accurately, without burden.Why Fruits?Mango, Strawberry and cherry are what everybody familiar with. Using the fruits can help people recognize the  different ports in a more user- friendly way. Fruits also have a magic to make people delightful, Which provide you creativeness and efficiency when you are working.""I'm not a big fan of tech and I love the fruits. Instead of cold computer things, it definitely will cheer me up when I am using it, it's cute and lively.""A financial  bachelor student studing in London said.

<h3>Designed for the Raspberry Pi 3</h3>
<p>piServer was designed around the brand new Raspberry Pi 3. Many considerations were made to ensure the best possible experience with the Raspberry Pi foundation’s new frontrunner. It was designed to take advantage of the processing power of the new Raspberry Pi 3. For those who already own Rasberry Pi's, it is also backwards compatible with the Raspberry Pi 2B. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472070970/zkk2dhdkvqurt0z4pyum.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Stunning Design</h3>
<p>piServer was designed to look sharp and to have big functionality within a small form. The criteria were to fit a 2.5"" hard drive and a Raspberry Pi 3 inside the case, along with the supporting circuitry. After many hours of mechanical design, we have done just that. </p>

<h3>Internal Hard Drive</h3>
<p>piServer has an integrated SATA controller and mounting points for a 2.5"" Hard Disk. It is offered with two different hard drive capacities: 1TB and 2TB.</p>

<h3>External Connector and SD Access</h3>
<p>On the back, the piServer has 3 external USB 2.0 ports, an HDMI port, a high current power input, an optical audio connector, and a USB 3.0 port for direct access to copy files to the hard drive. All piServers include an AC power adapter.</p>

<h3>Advanced Thermal Management</h3>
<p>To dissipate the heat generated by the Raspberry Pi 3, the piServer has an internal fan that is throttled by a PWM circuit paired with an included aluminum heatsink.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Smart Power System </h3>
<p>A microswitch on the back of the case paired with some smart internal circuitry allows the piServer to the started and shutdown in sync with the operating system. This allows the Raspberry Pi to prepare for a power off. The piServer's power circuitry senses when the Raspberry Pi has shut down and then shuts the power bus off. To boot the Pi, simply press the button on the back of the box. The piServer will re-enable the power busses, and the Pi will boot.</p>

<h3>Why should you trust NightShade Electronics?</h3>
<p>NightShade electronics is a proven company that has been operating since 2013. This is our second crowdfunding campaign, with our first being the energyShield (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nightshadeelectric/the-energyshield-power-for-your-arduino-creativity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nightshade...</a>). The energyShield has gone on to be a very successful product that has been available on Amazon ever since it went into production. Between then and now we have completed many contracted projects for several different companies. The piServer has been in development for years now, and we have decided that 2016 is the year for us to come back to the crowdfunding scene to make this product a reality. If you choose to back the piServer, you can rest assured that you will receive a great product!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Production Plan</h3>
<p>Using the experience from our 2014 Kickstarter campaign ( energyShield), we plan to avoid many of the common issues that cause delays and dissatisfied backers. We want to provide the best possible experience for everyone involved in this campaign.</p>
<p>There is always potential for problems and delays in manufacturing.  We are only choosing suppliers that we believe will do the best work and deliver the parts on time to help mitigate these risks. Doing so helps us ensure that all backers will receive their piServers before the scheduled delivery date. The funds from this campaign will provide the working capital that we need to fund the first production run.</p>
<p>Soon after our project is funded, we will order the injection mold to make the piServer case.  It is the item with the longest lead time, and therefore should be ordered first.  To streamline this process, we already have a company lined up to produce the molded parts.</p>
<p>Suppliers have been selected to produce the many other parts of the piServer, and they are ready to start production. Once all of the components arrive at Nightshade, we will get them assembled and mailed as quickly as possible.</p>

From those videos of your kids playing in the snow for the first time. To reviewing those contracts your boss just sent you. Even sending your crush those … very… intimate photos.Somethings are for our eyes only. That next-level security to make sure what’s private stays private. Some things need more than a fingerprint or pin code to see. Other biometric technologies prioritize quickly unlocking the phone instead of protecting a data vault. MobileIrisID is the first tool specifically designed to keep your private data hidden.With a simple scan, the Iris Key quickly reads your iris and automatically unlocks a secure data vault on your phone where you can store your passwords, photos and private documents.MobileIrisID Iris KeyThe USB-C adapter is small device that attaches to your Android phones and turns it into an iris recognition system. It will be powered by the phone and is compact enough to carry in your pocket. The user will a ttach the adapter to the phone and bring it up to their eye level to scan. Information will be sent over SSL to the cloud for verification, and will unlock the Data Vault App if it’s successful. The user can then see the information in their vault.Advanced algorithms will detect common spoofing methods, such as when someone tries to place a picture of an eye in front of the camera or scanning an unconscious person’s eye.MobileIrisID Data Vault AppThe data vault is an Android app that can store passwords, notes and pictures that can only be accessed if the user successfully authenticates using the MobileIrisID Iris Key. Even if you unlock your phone, you will need to re-authenticate with your eyes to access the app.The data will be encrypted on phone and shown only if the user has authenticated.Why the eyeIris Key provides you a level of security beyond the typical fingerprint or face recognition.

<p>Well, there are a couple of reasons for this timeline.</p>
<p>First, if a campaigner has promised to ship you a product that will be ready in 2 months, it probably means they already have the final prototype, tooling, and mould ready, and is only using crowdfunding as a marketing platform to boost sales.</p>
<p>We don't use crowdfunding as a marketing platform, we use it to bring Mu to life.</p>
<p>If this campaign will be unsuccessful, Mu will simply not exist.</p>
<p>Second, we don't want to make the same mistakes other campaigners have made before, by promising super-early deliveries which are most likely impossible to achieve, and eventually fail the backers.</p>
<p>We have doubled our estimated development and manufacturing times, just to make sure that we will not need to sacrifice product quality and support in order to deliver on time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>But won't my phone be outdated by the time I get it?</b></p>
<p>Don't worry, we've got you covered.</p>
<p>We have planned a specific time frame in our timeline to further upgrade Mu Red and Mu Blue as we get closer to mass production.</p>
<p>We will update the backers and create an option to keep the original configuration if needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>And what about specific frequencies?</b></p>
<p>We are currently working on adding as many LTE frequencies possible, with USA and European frequencies on top priority.</p>
<p>The MediaTek 6735 and 6753 support LTE WorldMode so we are going to have a very wide range of frequencies supported which is also perfect for traveling.</p>
<p>The moment we will have an exact list, we will publish it on the campaign and on our website.</p>

Goals


The Future is here

Center is a very smart device. It is designed not just to record and notify of any event but to detect really important issues. A built-in neural network and artificial intelligence perform deep analysis of what is happening on video and detect a wide range of objects and their actions in the frame. Did your mother or a friend just come over? Center will notify you. Any stranger around? Center will also inform you and record everything.

Meet the App

Turn your iOS or Android device into a home remote control with our mobile App. Using any other device with browser access? Utilise our Web App.
New philosophy, new outlook.

Stay connected, be notified

Get all types of notifications about your home and video cameras records! From now on you won’t miss anything important neither in the house nor around it. We mean it! Nothing else but really important!

WiFi without dead zones

Supported by cameras and WiFi repeaters, Center helps delivering and repeating WiFi signal. Fast and reliable WiFi, a single network name with a single password and high speed internet in every corner of your home. It takes only a few clicks to make it work.

Center is the brain of our entire system. It analyzes data flows from cameras and sensors, and intelligently and accurately decides on event importance, it is also in control of switchers and WiFi network.
This is just a unique device.

Center not only detects motion in video but also can see and analyze like a human

Artificial intelligence and artificial brain, deep neural network, smart self-learning system - Center has it all!
Center performs a detailed analysis of what is happening on video, detecting up to 20 object types and tracking their actions in the frame. Center can recognize roads, buildings and the surroundings so you won’t be disturbed with incidents happening on the road. With Center you will not get notifications about trees moving with the wind, sunlight piercing through clouds, snow fall etc.
Center can be taught to detect faces of your family members or your friends and you will be properly notified if any of them appears in the frame. Or the opposite – you will not be, depending on the settings you choose.
Center is fully compatible with any IP cameras. No need to worry that your smartphone will not playback a recorded video – Center will transcode any flow from the camera and record it in a format suitable for iOS, Android or any web browser.

WiFi control and coverage

With Center you can control WiFi network. Just connect our cameras and they will be both monitoring and serving as WiFi replicators.
Need a better WiFi range or would like to use your own cameras? You can still connect our WiFi replicators.
It is so easy now to define a network name, to set a single password and to get a high speed internet even where it never existed before.

Smart home with ZigBee

Center is a powerful thing allowing you full and easy control of your home. To implement this, we used ZigBee protocol.
With Center you can control air quality, temperature, the opening of doors or windows, water or gas leaks and fire risks.
You can also operate air-conditioning, light, heating, curtains and roller blinds, locks, electrical appliances and much more.

Control via the cloud, store in the cloud

By default Center is always connected with the cloud. Whenever you are away from home, you will receive notifications, have full control of your home, review images from cameras and playback recorded videos via the cloud.
The cloud allows you stay in touch with your home! It is easy and does not require any setup.

It does not matter whether you have a broadband channel or just a mobile internet. As long as you have any type of internet connection, you will see every message coming from our system.
Choose yourself what exactly to be transferred to the Cloud. Any moment you can change country your data is stored in - choose from USA, Germany, United Kingdom or Singapore.

Design

Compact Center made of opaque scratch resistant plastic in minimalist design will integrate perfectly with your interior whether this is a shelving unit, equipment stand or a desk.
Our Center is so pretty you don’t want to hide it in the storage room or in the attic!

Under the hood
Creating our products, we pay attention to every detail. Despite the fact Center is as tiny as only possible, it contains inside a powerful 5-core processor, several WiFi and ZigBee antennas. And all this in attractive palm-size case made of anti-scratch plastic.





Minimalist design, best matrix and wonderful picture quality, powerful battery and built-in WiFi and ZigBee signal repeaters for better network coverage. Our camera is not just a camera.
Summing up in three words - impressive, comprehensive, easy.

Best colour picture even in darkness

Only best components and attention to every detail make any product best.
That’s why in our camera we use Panasonic νMaicovicon® matrix, which gives bright colourful picture even in darkness. In complete pitch-black camera will automatically switch to night mode and infrared backlight will be on.

When the camera is not just a camera

Our camera is able not only to record high quality video but also to replicate WiFi and ZigBee signals. Now it’s all easy - once you have a camera you have a guaranteed WiFi signal.
For convenience we equipped our camera with just one port - Ethernet, which is used both for charging and data transfer, in case you don’t want to use WiFi for data transfer.
If you have unexpected blackout at home, both cameras and Center will keep working thanks to the built-in battery.

Design

Nice to touch anti-scratch opaque plastic, neat square form, front glass panel - all is designed not just for good performance but also for interior embellishment. You can easily install camera wherever you want - on a bookshelf or onto a house wall - this flexibility will only add to the great impressions of our products.

Under the hood
Powerful processor and incredible matrix, night mode, both PoE and battery power supply - we didn’t miss any single detail!




You can connect extra WiFi repeaters and have a high-speed internet all over the house without additional setup. Neat implementation will integrate seamlessly with your interior.
Nothing else. Just WiFi.

I - Infrastructure

Finally no more extra effort to stop a distant camera from losing WiFi signal. Because in our system it won’t be trying to connect to the Center directly. Simply no need because there is always available WiFi signal supplied from a much closer camera or a WiFi repeater mounted on the house wall for high speed internet even in your backyard.
​
Super fresh concept

It is easy to add sensors and switchers, easy to join them into a group, easy to manage the group. No more complex systems which require rigid settings performed only by professionals.

Super groups

Home control and monitoring devices can be grouped the way you want. Any groups can be created - a room, a floor, garden, garage or overall perimeter of the house. Every sensor or switcher can be included into unlimited number of groups.

Super sharing

Share the entire home control, access to some specific group or just one particular sensor or switcher with your family in two clicks.

Video / WiFi

Video monitoring and WiFi control are now isolated groups so they are always within easy reach. Sophisticated is very simple now.




Our product is a perfect combination of video surveillance with home remote control and modern technologies, such as artificial intelligence and self-learning neural networks. Guaranteed WiFi coverage and easy network control makes our product even more versatile.
We produce a brand new and unique product!

When sophisticated is simple

With our product, your house can see, feel and analyze just like any human.
The Center artificial intelligence will be constantly learning and accumulating knowledge about your habits, your lifestyle, any events inside and outside your house, it will learn to recognize your family members and friends.
Camuniti is not just a video surveillance system or a smart home concept. It is rather a smart entity giving you comfort and caring for you. And the longer you stay with it the better it understands you.

All included, even the future

Nvidia TK1 platform was chosen as a base for Center development. Creation of optimized algorithms and neural network compression let us achieve overcapacity exceeding needs for our current tasks. In future, we plan to use it for some new tasks and functions which we will create together with you and for you.
And you will get access to all of them once install Center updates.

100% free


What we use


Next steps

We’ve got plenty of ideas about what to do next, including extended open API, integration with IFTTT service, development and introduction of new connecting modules to ensure automated and simplified daily processes. You only need to connect them to the Center and take advantage of them!
We are head over heels about what we do and want to dedicate to this all our energy, skills and time. That’s not hard for us indeed. Because our business is our hobby!

Our products are unique for their technology, philosophy, ecosystem and the ease of use.
The entire R&D process has been financed by ourselves but it isn’t be enough to start production. That’s why we start a fundraising campaign on Indiegogo to cover production expenses.
There is no solution similar to Camuniti in the home security market, so let’s launch it together!

Risks
The development process is in full swing now. We have deployed a deep neural network on an embedded system. DNN recognizes objects in motion just like a human, so Center can understand what is happening in the frame.
Currently we are optimizing and compressing the network for better performance. Both hardware and design are almost ready, UI/UX is created and mobile apps programming is well underway.

I can call a car, have groceries delivered or read documents at the tap of an icon. Yet there are so many small visual tasks that no single app can perform.

By working almost everywhere, almost any blind person can turn to Perceptron for help, and any assistant wanting to offer it can do so from anywhere and from any device.</p><p>Perceptron is time-saving technology for blind people, by blind people. I often need a small amount of help to identify an object, find a building or perform some other visual task in a way that is more efficient and less stressful. As a software developer, I have the skills and insight to solve this. Nothing frustrates me more than putting off something simple that is impossible to do without sight. Not only have I not completed my task, but I have to <i>think </i>about it while remaining productive. Any Getting Things Done fan knows the peace of mind that comes from having all loops closed. Perceptron doesn't just solve one problem. Instead, it overcomes a whole range of challenges, letting me and others spend more time on those things that matter.

More recently, I've developed various websites and apps, and have seven years of experience working with Android. Some of my previous projects include:</p><ul>
<li>One of the first Android screen readers</li>
<li>A media content delivery app for a major access technology company</li>
<li>Open-source outdoor navigation software</li>
<li> A word processor for a major notetaker</li>
</ul><p></p><p><b>What's Done</b></p><p>Perceptron is currently a web-based application that transmits video between two parties. It accepts tasks from clients, publishes those tasks to assistants, marks them as complete, and sends status notifications, all in real-time. The web app also serves as the back-end for future native mobile apps, which only need to relay video and call into the back-end. As such, most of the heavy lifting is already done. What remains is polishing and packaging technology that already exists, making it more intuitive and a joy to work with.</p><p>I've partially developed an Android app to prove out my design. It currently submits tasks and sends video. It also offers integrations not possible on the web, such as using the device's flashlight to improve visibility. Future versions will support voice commands for hands-free operation, or for use on devices without convenient controls.</p><p>The Android app is developed in React Native, using native modules for video chat and device integration. All third-party libraries are available for both Android and iOS, and I anticipate an iOS port to primarily involve changing the interface to comply with Apple's guidelines.</p><p><b>How Your Donation Will Help</b></p><p>While technically solid, the core experience still needs work. Because I myself am blind, Perceptron's visual design requires improvement to simplify the work of sighted assistants. Hiring a designer would be incredibly beneficial. I also need to integrate with a back-end payment processor. Perceptron needs time to grow into a sustainable business, and donations will give me the breathing room to transition from an interesting prototype to a successful product.</p><p>Many blind users prefer iOS over Android. While Android app development is possible on any mainstream operating system, iOS requires OS X, and its device emulator is inaccessible. As such, I'll need to acquire the necessary hardware and Apple memberships to publish an iOS app. This includes a Mac Mini, as well as an iPad Mini for device-based testing.</p><p>Finally, I am committed to running the business in a responsible manner. It is unacceptable to open my doors without a solid legal entity. Further, I need to improve my terms of service as they relate to Perceptron's marketplace aspects. Some funds will be designated for establishing a Limited Liability Company, as well as for purchasing or drafting better legal documents.</p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p><p>Perceptron is not the first app to connect blind clients with sighted assistants. We hear about them every few months or so, and after a handful of articles in the popular press and a few convention appearances, some of those companies disappear. My biggest challenge is being taken seriously when many competitors struggle to deliver. Further, those who are successful don't push this concept to its fullest. It can be difficult believing in an idea when others' implementations of that idea don't go as far as we think they can and should. But I and Perceptron are uniquely positioned to address this.</p><p><i>By Blind People, for Blind People</i></p><p>Many efforts fail because they're great ideas that are executed poorly. Often imagined by a sighted person, that individual must then seek out blind users to serve as test subjects, or in an advisory capacity with no real input to the product's direction or validity.</p><p>The importance of blind leadership in access technology cannot be understated. As a blind person, I think this is a great and useful idea, and have spoken with other blind people who agree. By heading the development myself, instead of requiring validation and remediation to reach a basic level of functionality, I can guarantee that my apps will be a joy to use right from the start. Issues will certainly exist, but they won't be related to accessibility. We don't need more clunky products, bad ideas or companies of mostly sighted people building our future products. Instead, let's empower blind users and developers, giving them the lead.</p><p><i>Medical Thinking Hurts Everyone</i></p><p>Further, many developers of products like these believe that assistants must be trained and vetted, and that the apps themselves require extensive testing to be declared ""safe."" I don't need a certified professional to tell me the can I'm holding is oven cleaner, and I'm fully capable of choosing whether I can accept the risk of inaccurate assistance. I certainly wouldn't use Perceptron to cross a street or drive a car, but the line between acceptable and unacceptable risk is different for each person. It isn't someone else's to decide for me.</p><p>On top of that, the infrastructure needed to interview and vet professional assistants costs money and requires time, driving up development costs and decreasing revenue. Time wasted making inaccurate decisions  for the blind community is time not spent empowering us with good products. By trusting blind people to make sensible decisions, I can direct my efforts toward building a good platform that survives where others flounder. The last thing we need is another company built on a medical model of disability.</p><p><i>Sustainability = Survival</i></p><p>Other efforts are volunteer or donation-driven. A volunteer-based project may be free, but it is not without cost. Ventures must perpetually seek out funding to keep the lights on, development to enhance their platforms, and volunteers to assist blind clients. This is a triple-edged sword and is hardly sustainable. Without developer effort, the platform will stagnate. Without assistants, clients won't get the help they need. Without funds, everyone is putting in effort between other obligations and struggles to be fully committed to making the platform as good as it can be.</p><p>I'm building Perceptron to be a sustainable, subscription-oriented business from the start, one that does not perpetually seeking volunteers for its advancement. I pay for grocery shopping, transportation and food delivery because the companies providing those services offer improved experiences, continuing in part through my purchases. Similarly, I want to pay for a good, regularly-developed platform where I can get the help I need when I need it. I also want to know that the platform won't stagnate, and will continue growing in ways that challenge this industry to think along new lines and to create new products.</p><p><i>Other Challenges</i></p><p>I have never written an iOS app. Most companies in this position immediately hire outside developers, as the differences between these platforms are challenging for app developers familiar with only one to address.</p><p>However, in Facebook and other high-profile companies have recently built a platform called React Native for creating native mobile apps on Android and iOS. In describing an early experience with React Native, Facebook claims to have reused around 85% of its code when porting an iOS React Native app to Android. Contrast that with the old way of doing things, where almost no code works on multiple platforms and each app is entirely separate. Many other companies report similar experiences. One common theme is that teams historically separated by platform can work together, collaborating on the same codebase and becoming more efficient. React Native was also recently backed by Microsoft with its addition of Universal Windows to the list of supported platforms.</p><p>While developing my Android prototype, I quickly brought my video chat code from the web to Android in a half hour, with only a few lines of code changed. Similarly, implementing the capability to log in and submit tasks was straight-forward, and the only code specific to Android is the layout for the user interface. At this time I have no reason to think that an iOS port will be any more involved than complying with Apple's interface guidelines, and while there will almost certainly be unanticipated challenges, fixing an app that mostly works is a much easier prospect than building something from scratch on an unfamiliar platform in an unfamiliar language with a minimal budget. I don't expect it to be easy, but the cost of developing an iOS app from scratch would be several times that of this entire campaign, and would change Perceptron's iOS success from a realistic possibility to an impossible pipe dream.</p><p><b>Other Ways To Help</b></p><p>Can't donate? That's OK. Perceptron won't succeed with money alone, and every bit of help is appreciated.</p><p>Spread the word on social media. Tweet about my campaign or share it with your Facebook friends. If you have a blog or podcast, consider mentioning Perceptron in a post or episode.</p><p>Also, Perceptron won't succeed without sighted assistants.

</div></div>","Hi,
We are RedZ Technologies and today we are proud to present our newest creation -  a 3D Laser Scanner that is able to scan physical objects with a resolution of up to 0.1 mm.


The body of the scanner is made of anodized aircraft aluminum and has built in two 5MP camera modules ( OV5640 ) it also has four LED lights, to illuminate the object while scanning it.



On the top you will find two riffles  with color LED embedded underneath, they will be used to display scanner statuses by changing their color.
On the back you will find a micro USB port, as well as a micro SD card slot.

The rotating turret on top of the scanner will contain a laser with a line generating objective lens. The main PCB has two spring-loaded pins, which are used to pass power to the turret.


3D model of the scanner itself.

Turntable that connects to 3D scanner via Bluetooth







How it works:

Scanner swipes a laser line along a physical object. Line adjusts, according to the shape of the object and is detected by scanner's two cameras. By setting position of the cameras and laser turret, built in Free-scale iMX6 processor will able to build an accurate point cloud and will transfer it via USB or WiFi to a PC, MAC, or mobile device. 
Next steps include the user to either rotate the object by hand or use the Bluetooth turntable to scan the object from a different angles.
Once the object is scanned, point clouds are combined and our software reconstructs a full 3D mesh.




Sample scans:

Angel sculpture, 50 mm in height, scanned from 5 sides.
Dental impression castings, scanned from 4 sides, at a 45 degree angle.
Larger sculpture, 350mm in length, scanned from 5 sides.
""Little Mermaid"" sculpture, 40mm in height, scanned from 4 sides.You can see the artifacts caused by the reflective surface.
Photos of the physical prototype:






In the photo below you can see the stepper motor gear, that turns the Scanner. You can also see spring-loaded pins that power the laser.

Dimensional drawing of the scanner. (Dimensions 140x70x36 mm)

What have we done so far:

1. Aluminum housing is fully designed and a physical prototype proves its work-ability.
2. First working PCB is made and will be updated before sending it to customer.
3. Firmware that analyzes images from the cameras, detects the laser line and calculates a point cloud accordingly is made and working.
4. Command-line version of the software fusing the point clouds that turns into a mesh using the Poisson algorithm , cut off the unneeded parts and generates a seamless mosaic texture.

What need to be done in the future:1. In order for the aluminum housing to be reasonably priced, it needs to be manufactured by injection molding process in Asia, which requires steel molds and other tooling.2. We plan to mane one more iteration of the PCB, before considering it finished and ready for mass production.3. We also need to create a GUI ( graphical user interface ) for our software and to make it available for multiple platforms.Our team:

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>This project has already come a long way after several iterations of the product development. We've finalized our designs and there shouldn't be much to worry about toward the final fulfillment.</p>
<p>In any possible, certification might have a chance to slow us down a bit as the electronic hardware must be tested and approved by various independent agencies. We've gotten a head start on the process of FCC and CE certification. We’ll optimize our products in compliance with the certification and will complete it ASAP.</p>

Anti-Scratch *
The form of the stainless steel frame/bracket fits snugly over the curves of your device without adding bulk. A silky, soft-touch finish of the silicone on the inside helps protect your phone from scratch.
Low Temperature *  
Traditional Qi wireless chargers are not very efficient and generate a lot of heat which causes the iPhone to reduce or stop charging completely to lower operating temperature. But Boltron will never get your phone overheated, not even close to being.
Interference-Free 
Traditional Qi wireless chargers have fluctuating electromagnetic frequencies that may interfere with iPhone functions like Touch & FaceID. Boltron uses a fixed frequency designated by Apple that does not interfere with Touch or Face ID.
Intelligent Reliable Protection System  
Overcurrent, Overvoltage, Short Circuit, and Overheated Protection.

Foreign Object Detection -- (FOD) is a safety mechanism which automatically interrupts power delivery if there is interference caused by a foreign object.
Obviously, Boltron (left) is much more effortless than the regular phone cradle (right).

CEO / Roberto Iten / Industrial Designer
Roberto is the man behind Boltron's creation. He believes that most of the products can be enhanced and totally reach a higher level, just like he did for the Boltron. He has a rich experience with the product designing work. Especially for tech products, he always has the angle on making the product stylish without sacrificing any usability.

Co-Founder / Anthony Maguire / Electronic Engineer
Anthony is Roberto's best friend. They attended the same high school and university. Anthony is the man behind Boltron's blazing fast charging experience.
 
 
In short, attach and bonding different things together is what makes us progressive and collaborative, to build a strongly bonded connection in things, and to integrate powers/resources in achieving a higher efficiency. We found the way to build up a perfect balance in bonding man, phone, and car all into one like a force of ""trinity"". Instead of letting all these factors interfere with each other, Boltron is more creating a complementarity among the factors and to make the driving experience improved.So, we set out to design the world's first in-car phone cradle that redefines the category and better than anything else available: it's a driving companion—a cradle specifically designed to accompany on-the-go people, whether they are commuting around the block or around the state.Boltron (right) --- Unbeatable Stability & Security
  
 

 
Risks and challenges
This project has already come a long way after several iterations of the product development. We've finalized our designs and there shouldn't be much to worry about toward the final fulfillment.
In any possible, certification might have a chance to slow us down a bit as the electronic hardware must be tested and approved by various independent agencies. We've gotten a head start on the process of FCC and CE certification. We’ll optimize our products in compliance with the certification and will complete it ASAP.",45.0,6,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","A message in a bottle to the future.
 
Ezl is a great little product, which unfortunately has been unable to gain traction amongst the Indiegogo community this time. I invite you to follow its story, and maybe try one for yourself, by visiting myplinth.co.uk.
Sadly, I fear the reason that it hasn’t been funded is not so much a judgement on its design, as a reflection that successful crowdfunding seems now to be the domain of those who can afford paid social media campaigns, expensive referral agencies, influencers and others who make their living by promoting crowdfunding campaigns.
I cannot afford these - which is why I came to the community to help gather the investment which my business needs in order to grow.
I invite you to seek out great design wherever you can find it - and often you may need to dig deep to cut through the sheer volume of noise created by those who already have the funds to afford great marketing of their ideas.
Thank you for your interest in Ezl.
John Bull
 
HOLD IT.  BETTER.
With the press of a single button Ezl gives you the security of a comfortable phone grip or the practicality of a phone stand, wherever and whenever you need it.
When you don't... forget it - you won't notice Ezl on the back of your phone.
_________
EZL is designed so you can easily reach all of your screen when using your phone and is perfect for taking selfies. You will never drop your phone again!

 


 
 
SEE IT.   BETTER.
Perfect if you are working and need to keep an eye on your messages or watching videos.
Non-slip rubber feet keep your phone secure so you can sit back and relax knowing its secure.
_____________
Easy to deploy slide out stand with 3 adjustable angles and portrait mode. Just press the button and slide to your desired angle.


 
 
CHARGE IT. BETTER.
No metals, no magnets, no disassembly.
Just put it down.
 

 
 
LESS.   IS MORE.

Its taken over a year of development to design out every unnecessary molecule, leaving you with a precision reliable device which weighs only 6g!
 
Once you are done using your Ezl just push it flat. It's that simple. Ezl will never get in your way when not in use, and will never catch on your pockets.
 

 
 
Protection for your phone.
For some applications, plastic performs better than metal. Tiny metal features can weaken over time and just aren't made to stand up to rigorous daily use - that's why we have seen so many ""thinnest"" phone grips and stands go wrong before.
Ezl's rubber feet protrude 0.3mm - but it's enough to give non-slip protection to the back of your phone. 
Now it won't slip off the car bonnet!

 
 
 
 
John has been making and selling his designs since 2014 (have a look for Plinth - the world's best tablet stand). Everything he makes is guaranteed for life.
 

 
He has happy customers. Ask them.


 


 

 
 
 
COLOURS FOR YOUR PHONE
From metallic denim blue to a stunning pearlescent purple, Ezl comes in a range of carefully selected colours to complement most phone case designs.

Compatibility.
Ezl is small enough to fit on any smartphone from iPhone4 onwards, and will stick to most surfaces except silicone rubber (test your surface with ordinary sticky tape).
It can be safely removed when you want to move it to another phone or case - replacement adhesive membranes are available on our web shop.
 
Whats in the box?
Ezl comes in a sleek and stylish box complete with everything you need to get your stand set up. Step by step instructions are included along with an alcohol wipe to clean your phone or case before attaching your stand.


 
Why we need your help.
Ezl is already in production which is great news for you. Enter your pledge and rest easy knowing your awesome new stand will be making its way to you soon.
However, Ezl is far from where we would like it to be. With your help we aim to take Ezl to the next level...
Ezl’s hidden secret
Ezl isn’t just two devices.. it’s three. Ezl has been meticulously designed with the future in mind, so includes hidden features which will allow it to dock to a range of accessories - wireless charging desk stands, car mounts, bike mounts, wall mounts and more.
Development is well underway, with working prototypes promising exciting features. But getting things right takes time, and we need help bringing these and other designs to life.
Invest in our journey, and enjoy your Ezl as it gets better and better.

<p>SmartCharge uses power-sensing technology to align the charge-receiving coils of your phone with the induction coils of the wireless charger. This maximizes the speed and power of the charge, and when combined with Qi technology, makes it the fastest in the world for your car. Plus, the entire process is hands-free, making your journey safer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Fastest, Smartest Charging for Any Phone </h2>
<p>Based on our exclusive power-detection algorithm, SmartCharge aligns the absolute center of both charging locations with 100% accuracy, no matter the phone type. You can put a Samsung in the charger and immediately replace it with an iPhone, and the SmartCharge finds the perfect center every time. Because of its power-delivery input, the charger refuels your phone with a powerful 15W, but gives you the ultimate convenience of wireless with maximum compatibility. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi My name is Raj Chanda and I’ve been a banker for 17 years. After I have been made redundant which was recently I have decided to setup my own business. The idea for a new telephone network came across when I had a poor experience with a telephone provider transferring my number across. It took them 3 months and they had no clue what was going on. The new telephone system I plan on designing and setting up will allow people from all over the world to communicate with each other without the need for telephone numbers. This will solve most of the problems in the communication industry. Your help will allow a new era to come about and disturb the major players in the communication industry. Your assistance will give us a head start to design new technology and phones to allow this communication to happen. I thank you all for coming onboard and with me on this journey.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It’s not a lot to ask but we are looking at 500k GBP to get started. This will help 2 year office rental. Some staff, research and development and to bring about a prototype of the new network will be trying to build. We will need to then patent the technology and build prototype servers to handle the communication data around the world. I will then require fees for communication license in the respected countries. To help with the funding I have some perks, please feel free to purchase any perks to get us started.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To establish a new way of communicating from one side of the world to another without phone numbers. We will use a different system to ID a person, in turn our system will be like having speed dial on your phone to whomever and wherever with no restriction to countries, therefore reducing lag on current video calls and delivering the best HD calls wherever you are. No more excessive bills or searching for internet signal. No more worries if you’re in a remote area or not. We will be implementing new technology that will allow us to connect from a village in the middle of nowhere without the conventional method of wiring your house to your road.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Licensing in certain countries may be a issue however were willing to go into dialogue with certain countries over this. Product development is another we have a few manufacturers and highly qualified engineers ready and on standby. Once this funding is complete. The development of new phones with new tech will be looked into.</p>

Hi My name is Raj Chanda and I’ve been a banker for 17 years. After I have been made redundant which was recently I have decided to setup my own business. The idea for a new telephone network came across when I had a poor experience with a telephone provider transferring my number across. It took them 3 months and they had no clue what was going on. The new telephone system I plan on designing and setting up will allow people from all over the world to communicate with each other without the need for telephone numbers. This will solve most of the problems in the communication industry. Your help will allow a new era to come about and disturb the major players in the communication industry. Your assistance will give us a head start to design new technology and phones to allow this communication to happen. I thank you all for coming onboard and with me on this journey.
 


What We Need & What You Get
It’s not a lot to ask but we are looking at 500k GBP to get started. This will help 2 year office rental. Some staff, research and development and to bring about a prototype of the new network will be trying to build. We will need to then patent the technology and build prototype servers to handle the communication data around the world. I will then require fees for communication license in the respected countries. To help with the funding I have some perks, please feel free to purchase any perks to get us started.
 

 

The Impact
To establish a new way of communicating from one side of the world to another without phone numbers. We will use a different system to ID a person, in turn our system will be like having speed dial on your phone to whomever and wherever with no restriction to countries, therefore reducing lag on current video calls and delivering the best HD calls wherever you are. No more excessive bills or searching for internet signal. No more worries if you’re in a remote area or not. We will be implementing new technology that will allow us to connect from a village in the middle of nowhere without the conventional method of wiring your house to your road.
 

 

Risks & Challenges
Licensing in certain countries may be a issue however were willing to go into dialogue with certain countries over this. Product development is another we have a few manufacturers and highly qualified engineers ready and on standby. Once this funding is complete. The development of new phones with new tech will be looked into.
 

 

Other Ways You Can Help
I cannot stress how much we will appreciate your help by spreading the word out there for us. If you cannot contribute financially you can help by spreading the news using word of mouth, social media posts, nudges or making it viral for us on social media platforms. We will be grateful for any assistance from any angle. Don’t forget you can use Indiegogo’s share tools or if you have any other methods feel free to use them.

<h3>Developing the Technology</h3>
<p>We, at Fantom Dynamics, have been developing modular walkie talkie technology for the past 8 years. Starting with the original prototype based on a universal case to mount a walkie talkie to any phone. With the design complete and the funds raised, we will be able to continue further development. And, most importantly, integrate our modular walkie talkie into the MotoMods™ system as well as obtain FCC certification. This will allow us to bring to you, the consumer, this new state of the art walkie talkie.</p>

Developing the Technology
We, at Fantom Dynamics, have been developing modular walkie talkie technology for the past 8 years. Starting with the original prototype based on a universal case to mount a walkie talkie to any phone. With the design complete and the funds raised, we will be able to continue further development. And, most importantly, integrate our modular walkie talkie into the MotoMods™ system as well as obtain FCC certification. This will allow us to bring to you, the consumer, this new state of the art walkie talkie.

FCC Part 95 certification will be filed before the tooling fabrication phase, but subject to change

<p>The risks which come with the Portal Puck are similar to those of any small business attempting to bring a product to market. At Portal Design Solutions we like to think of these risks as surmountable obstacles, which when accounted for, can be avoided or overcome. The Portal Puck team is fortunate to have two members who have each successfully designed, manufactured and sold previous products. It is the experience, talent, and motivations of our team which we believe will allow us to move though the Puck's design, testing, manufacturing, and finally delivery, without falling short due to inexperience or common risks.</p>

<p>My name is Adrian <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>and I was born in Madrid (Spain), where I lived and studied until I moved to London.

<p>One of the problems I had always faced while working in Arduino projects, 
was the big pain and hard work I needed to do every time I wanted to swap between one project and another, and every time I needed to transport or share them.</p>
<p>A few months ago, I thought that it was not worth it to mount 
and dismount all my projects every time and loose all my work. <b>Not anymore! </b>So, I 
started to design my first draft of the shield.      </p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Now, I have created <b>GPIOduino</b>

</div></div>","Introducing GPIOduino






My name is Adrian and I was born in Madrid (Spain), where I lived and studied until I moved to London. I'm a Telecommunications Engineer with a great passion for software and hardware, and I've spent several years tinkering and making stuff with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
One of the problems I had always faced while working in Arduino projects, 
was the big pain and hard work I needed to do every time I wanted to swap between one project and another, and every time I needed to transport or share them.
A few months ago, I thought that it was not worth it to mount 
and dismount all my projects every time and loose all my work. Not anymore! So, I 
started to design my first draft of the shield.      

Now, I have created GPIOduino
 and I can easily work in several projects at the same time. I can 
quickly swap between them and I can safely store my projects for the future. 
Today, I would like to share this idea with everyone.

Why Indiegogo?

To
 make the GPIOduino shield affordable and available to anyone, we need to manufacture at least 100 boards. Indiegogo is the best solution in this 
case. We can offer this shield to anyone who wants it, regardless of their 
location and with the same conditions.
      

Where are we now?
GPIOduino has already been sent to a professional PCB manufacturer and the prototype is now with us. Currently, we are testing the shield and doing awesome projects.
All the I/O pins from Arduino have been extended to the GPIO port as follows:     





What will you get?

PERK 1: GPIOduino Shield Only = £12 



PERK 2: GPIOduino Basic Kit = £18




PERK 3: GPIOduino Retail Kit - 15% Off = £153
Compatibility?
GPIOduino is an IO extension shield compatible with the majority of Arduino boards, shields and compatible systems. However, due to our limited budget the shield has not been tested against all the products available in the market at this stage.

Receive and fill out the survey via e-mail for your device model or to attach your custom design, if you ordered custom phone case.<br/>5. We receive your demands and prepare your order according them. <br/>6. You receive your awesome perks :)</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>There is absolutly no risk for you. Our goal is fixed to $9900. That means that, if we don’t rich this goal by its deadline, all contributions will be refunded back to the contributors by Indiegogo, typically within 5-7 business days. But if you help us to reach this goal you will receive your awesome perks!</p><p>Our project needs only the final amount of $9900 to go to mass production. Everything else is already achieved. The suppliers, the engineers, the materials, the taxes, everything is fixed and calculated. All the amount of money goes for the implementation of the project. All previous steps are already passed by us.</p><p><b>The Person Behind This Project</b></p><p>My name is Valentin Bachov and I am CEO of Protecto Ltd. This is my first campaign. And I am excited to present you my new project. But first let me tell you little history of me and my small company with big dreams.</p><p><strong>How I get involved in customizing phone cases?</strong></p><p>A few years ago I was searching for a special gift for friend of mine. I wanted to be something special, personal and visible to others. I decided to be phone cover. Somewhere in that search I found my passion about customization. With little money and huge enthusiasm I found my small company.</p><p><strong>How I started customizing screen protectors?</strong></p><p>When I was involved to mobile device protection, I just loved how the screen protectors works. And I wanted to be able to produce screen guards, not only for smartphones, but for every device, which has glass on it. This project allows us to create curved protectors for curwed screen (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Edge series).</p><p><strong>How we decide to make this project and what are the advantages?</strong></p><p>We are always striving for improvement. One year ago we decided to create whole new system for customization, which will increase the quality and reduce the cost of our custom products. After 1 year of researching, negotiations with suppliers, meeting with partners, prototyping and testing we are ready to go to the final step - Implementation.</p><p><strong>What our project will improve?</strong></p><ol>
<li>The price of custom cases and protectors is too high. Our project reduce the prices of the end product up to 30 %.</li>
<li>Quality. Our project increases the quality of the products, using high quality materials and innovative technologies. We will make them to last much longer.</li>
<li>The amount of supported models and devices is limited to the most widespread. When our campaign finish we will be able to produce custom cases for over 500 models smartphones and 4 different kinds of screen protectors for 2000 model devices.</li>
</ol><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Our project needs last amount of $9900 to be finished and to go to mass production.</p><ol>
<li>$5200 – for equipment, hardware and software.</li>
<li>S2800 – for high quality materials, which will be used to produce our first production for bakers.</li>
<li>$1900 – for finishing new web platform, where everyone can easily create custom phone cases and order screen protectors.</li>
</ol><p>You will be the first who will receive our new products from this campaign.</p><ol><li>
<strong>Custom Phone Case</strong>. We will produce high quality jelly phone cases with designs of your choice. The colors are bright and vivid. There is no fading, nor peeling! Image last forever!

All previous steps are already passed by us.The Person Behind This ProjectMy name is Valentin Bachov and I am CEO of Protecto Ltd. This is my first campaign. And I am excited to present you my new project. But first let me tell you little history of me and my small company with big dreams.How I get involved in customizing phone cases?A few years ago I was searching for a special gift for friend of mine. I wanted to be something special, personal and visible to others. I decided to be phone cover. Somewhere in that search I found my passion about customization. With little money and huge enthusiasm I found my small company.How I started customizing screen protectors?When I was involved to mobile device protection, I just loved how the screen protectors works. And I wanted to be able to produce screen guards, not only for smartphones, but for every device, which has glass on it. This project allows us to create curved protectors for curwed screen (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Edge series).How we decide to make this project and what are the advantages?We are always striving for improvement. One year ago we decided to create whole new system for customization, which will increase the quality and reduce the cost of our custom products. After 1 year of researching, negotiations with suppliers, meeting with partners, prototyping and testing we are ready to go to the final step - Implementation.What our project will improve?
The price of custom cases and protectors is too high. Our project reduce the prices of the end product up to 30 %.
Quality. Our project increases the quality of the products, using high quality materials and innovative technologies. We will make them to last much longer.
The amount of supported models and devices is limited to the most widespread. When our campaign finish we will be able to produce custom cases for over 500 models smartphones and 4 different kinds of screen protectors for 2000 model devices.
What We Need & What You GetOur project needs last amount of $9900 to be finished and to go to mass production.
$5200 – for equipment, hardware and software.
S2800 – for high quality materials, which will be used to produce our first production for bakers.

<p>Made with full-grain vegetable-tanned leather, durable elastic, and a stitch-free construction, PowerPlay is resistant to breakage and will be a lifelong companion to your adapter and cable.</p>
</div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you're a frequent traveler or just want to manage the length of the USB-C cable, you'll appreciate the PowerPlay for its ease of use and portability.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Oh... and did we mention that PowerPlay uses vegetable-tanned leather, which maintains a natural softness and buttery touch? You'll love how it looks as much as how it feels in your hands. Like fine wine getting better with age, vegetable-tanned leather looks better with long term use.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3>Design Approach</h3>
<p>We chose to work with vegetable-tanned leather because it is a natural material that is amazingly versatile and durable. Besides being the leather of choice for high-end luxury goods, vegetable-tanned leather has the unique property of maintaining structured forms while remaining supple and malleable.</p>
<p>Through many iterations, we determined the best design that would optimize this material's features, yet eliminate the need for clasps, closures, and sewing. Engineering the PowerPlay comes down to the tiniest millimeters, taking into consideration detailed physical characteristics of the leather, adapter, and cable, including most importantly usage behavior.</p>
<p>The result? The coiled cables fit snugly between the two pieces of leather, minimizing bulk. Initially, the leather starts off slightly stiff then gently molds to the shape of the coiled cables - the way a pair of jeans will mold to your body.</p>
<p>The sturdiness of the leather created a built-in ""lock"" for the cable that uses its own body as the closure, allowing for easy lock and release of the cable. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437653124/iyxkafj37lijnuuldl6k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Finally, to reflect people's intuitive behavior in storing cables, we made sure the design allowed the accessory to be attached to the adapter.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>How Is It Made?</b></h3>
<p>We might be based in Asia, but we don’t like sweatshops. Our suppliers are proud owners of second-generation family businesses. We ensure our craftswomen receive compensation above the minimum wage and have flexible working hours. </p>
<p>We use high-quality vegetable tanned leather from the UK with a smooth grain and lightly waxed finish.  We work with an established 40-year-old leather workshop to cut the hide into required shapes and thickness. Our craftswomen then bevel and burnish the edges with beeswax to create a polished look, before assembling the pieces by hand. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>How To Use It</b></h3>
<p>Using PowerPlay is simple. Just slip the elastic band around the adapter, making sure the leveled side aligns with the side of adapter that plugs into the socket. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436099005/w6abwdohz9devblephff.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>To lock the stored cables in place, slip the cable along the hook and lift the side of the leather where the cable slides out to create a slight overlap.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>How big is PowerPlay 29W? </b></i><br/></p>
<p>With the entire length of the cable stored, PowerPlay's cable reel measures about 2cm or 3/4 inch thick, with a diameter of 8cm or 3.2 inches. That's just slighty more than the actual volume of the cable.</p>
<p><i><b>Why should I use PowerPlay instead of some other way to manage my cable?</b></i></p>
<p>PowerPlay stays attached to your adapter at all times, so you'll never need to think about where to store your unused cable manager or fiddle with a cable tie. Sure, you could go for the regular rubber band or Velcro tie, but PowerPlay makes it so much easier to manage and care for both the cable and the adapter. Silicone cable managers might be cheaper, but the rubbery surface collects dirt easily and is likely to drag the contents in your bag. </p>
<p><i><b>With a reportedly long battery life, does the MacBook really need a cable manager? </b></i></p>
<p>Reviews show that the MacBook battery life could go as low <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">as 4.5 hours with heavy usage, so you may need to carry around the power adapter more than you think. And as we all know, as a laptop ages, the battery doesn't last as long as it originally did. PowerPlay, however, can help manage your MacBook cables from now till years to come, at home and on the go.</span></p>
<p><i><b>Will PowerPlay make my adapter prone to overheating?</b></i></p>
<p>No. As you can see, the leather on PowerPlay doesn't fit around the entire adapter. The leather pieces simply hook to the elastic strap, leaving plenty of room for the adapter to 'breathe'. Besides, vegetable-tanned leather is a natural, porous material that allows heat to disperse easily.</p>
<p><i><b>How long will my PowerPlay last? </b></i></p>
<p>We expect it to last as long as your MacBook, if not longer. As it is assembled with no stitches, the chances of breakage are slim. The woven elastic strap is extremely durable, the same as those being used as shoes straps. </p>
<p><i><b>Will the elastic strap slip off my adapter? </b></i></p>
<p>Not with normal usage. We carried out heavy-duty tests by placing the adapter with PowerPlay in a duffle bag and putting it through a lot of shaking and throwing around. Everything stayed perfectly put.</p>
<p><i><b>Will the PowerPlay block adjacent sockets when plugged in? </b></i></p>
<p>No, the PowerPlay will not block any adjacent socket when plugged in. The standard space between the sockets is 2.5 cm or 1"".</p>
<p><i><b>Will the PowerPlay add too much weight to the adapter <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">when plugged into a wall?</span></b></i></p>
<p>No. If the same plugs can hold the heavy weight of Apple's 85w power adapter, then the attached PowerPlay won't affect its performance.</p>

</div></div>","If you're one of the lucky ones with the new MacBook, you might have noticed that its power adapter lacks the usual built-in cable manager 'wings' of the MagSafe adapters. The new USB-C charging cable is also longer, thicker, and more unruly than other Apple power cords, adding cord clutter to bags, desks, and floors. So we took on the challenge of designing a cable manager for Apple's 29W Power Adapter for the 12-in MacBook.Cable managers in the market are common, but the disposable mass-produced nature of the products makes them degrade and get dirty quickly. We wanted to design a cable manager that is user-friendly and would last a long time, yet is affordable.PowerPlay: Cable Manager for 29W Power AdapterPowerPlay makes it easy to use, carry, and store your USB-C cable.
> PORTABILITYKeep your cable snug and secured within the leather reel, which stays connected to the adapter even when plugged in. No more fumbling with any loose accessories.


> CONTROL

Wind up loose cables so any excess length remains in storage to keep desks and floors clutter-free.

> LONG LASTING



Made with full-grain vegetable-tanned leather, durable elastic, and a stitch-free construction, PowerPlay is resistant to breakage and will be a lifelong companion to your adapter and cable.

If you're a frequent traveler or just want to manage the length of the USB-C cable, you'll appreciate the PowerPlay for its ease of use and portability.
Oh... and did we mention that PowerPlay uses vegetable-tanned leather, which maintains a natural softness and buttery touch? You'll love how it looks as much as how it feels in your hands. Like fine wine getting better with age, vegetable-tanned leather looks better with long term use.


Design Approach
We chose to work with vegetable-tanned leather because it is a natural material that is amazingly versatile and durable. Besides being the leather of choice for high-end luxury goods, vegetable-tanned leather has the unique property of maintaining structured forms while remaining supple and malleable.
Through many iterations, we determined the best design that would optimize this material's features, yet eliminate the need for clasps, closures, and sewing. Engineering the PowerPlay comes down to the tiniest millimeters, taking into consideration detailed physical characteristics of the leather, adapter, and cable, including most importantly usage behavior.
The result? The coiled cables fit snugly between the two pieces of leather, minimizing bulk. Initially, the leather starts off slightly stiff then gently molds to the shape of the coiled cables - the way a pair of jeans will mold to your body.
The sturdiness of the leather created a built-in ""lock"" for the cable that uses its own body as the closure, allowing for easy lock and release of the cable. 



Finally, to reflect people's intuitive behavior in storing cables, we made sure the design allowed the accessory to be attached to the adapter.




How Is It Made?
We might be based in Asia, but we don’t like sweatshops. Our suppliers are proud owners of second-generation family businesses. We ensure our craftswomen receive compensation above the minimum wage and have flexible working hours. 
We use high-quality vegetable tanned leather from the UK with a smooth grain and lightly waxed finish.  We work with an established 40-year-old leather workshop to cut the hide into required shapes and thickness. Our craftswomen then bevel and burnish the edges with beeswax to create a polished look, before assembling the pieces by hand. 


How To Use It
Using PowerPlay is simple. Just slip the elastic band around the adapter, making sure the leveled side aligns with the side of adapter that plugs into the socket. 

Wind the cables around the center to store.

To lock the stored cables in place, slip the cable along the hook and lift the side of the leather where the cable slides out to create a slight overlap.
To plug your adapter into the socket, unravel cables to your desired length. Adjust the the front piece so the leveled side aligns with the adapter side that plugs into the socket.
Plug away!

FAQ

Who are the people behind this nifty cable manager?
We're the founders of abovethefray.co and creators of the PowerPlay cable manager for the 85w & 60 Apple power adapters. Flashback a year ago, in NYC, we were featured as an Emerging Designer-Maker at the NYNOW International trade exhibition. It was there that the original PowerPlay for MagSafe adapters  was debuted to the world. The PowerPlay for 85W/60W adapters continues to receive great customer reviews and was picked up by:

<p>It is aptly called OTG (On The Go) that works not just with Apple devices but also with those running on Android. </p>
<p>OTG comes in a slim square design that’s 11mm thick. It features three different plugs on its three sides (a standard USB plug, a Micro-USB plug and a Lightning connector) that allow the device to work with Macs and PCs, iOS products and devices that run on Android. The device is capable of both syncing and charging any device as it also packs its own battery, which can later on be used to augment a device’s energy supply.</p>
<p>Users will be able to play different kinds of media straight from OTG including music, movies and images. OTG can also function as a Bluetooth locator which either allow users to locate their smartphone using the device or locate keys (OTG has a special latch where keys can be connected) using its companion app.</p>
<p>OTG comes in three different storage capacities: 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. It supports various file formats for photos, videos, audio and even documents. The device is now available for pre-order on the company’s website with the 32GB going for $199  and goes up to $349 for the 128GB version. OTG can be purchased at a fraction of that with perks right here on Indiegogo.</p>

<h4>Why We Need You

<p>We have come to Indiegogo to share our
project with all of you, our incredible community of supporters. You deserve a
better device that can support all your needs On The Go. We also want to hear
and learn from you--your suggestions and feedback will not only help us improve
our project, but will also be implemented into our rewards and additional
features of OTG. We know this is an ambitious project, but we are certain that
with your help OTG will become a worldwide reality.</p>

<h4>Risks &amp; Challenges </h4>
<p> </p>
<p>OTG is designed to be simple and useful.
We’ve worked hard over the last year to get it to this point and we
successfully completed critical milestones. We also used reputable electronics
manufacturers who offer great engineering support and development tools. What
remains is completing the manufacturing phase and that’s where our training and
experience comes in. We have successfully launched multiple products into the
marketplace, so we are confident that manufacturing risk is at a minimum.  </p>
<p>When we started this project, our goal
was to bring a product that is fun, cool, and useful. We believe OTG is just
that! We had a great time working on transforming the concept to reality. We
cannot wait to finalize OTG and put it in your hands. All we need now is your
help and support to cover the cost of what remains. We are well versed in the challenges involved in delivery, so we hope our experience in delivering products will help us to make sure that your perks arrive on time and in mint condition.</p>

It is aptly called OTG (On The Go) that works not just with Apple devices but also with those running on Android. 
OTG comes in a slim square design that’s 11mm thick. It features three different plugs on its three sides (a standard USB plug, a Micro-USB plug and a Lightning connector) that allow the device to work with Macs and PCs, iOS products and devices that run on Android. The device is capable of both syncing and charging any device as it also packs its own battery, which can later on be used to augment a device’s energy supply.
Users will be able to play different kinds of media straight from OTG including music, movies and images. OTG can also function as a Bluetooth locator which either allow users to locate their smartphone using the device or locate keys (OTG has a special latch where keys can be connected) using its companion app.
OTG comes in three different storage capacities: 32GB, 64GB and 128GB. It supports various file formats for photos, videos, audio and even documents. The device is now available for pre-order on the company’s website with the 32GB going for $199  and goes up to $349 for the 128GB version. OTG can be purchased at a fraction of that with perks right here on Indiegogo.
Grab the chance to be part of this campaign!







HOW DOES IT WORK:




The OTG system is a combination of the OTG Device and a mobile app. These two components work together to allow users to transfer, sync and
convert files quickly and easily between iOS and Android devices
as well as Macs and PCs. Access movies in air or in a remote area and
never needing a network or Internet.

<p><b>Q: Will the ALUM scratch the plastic
surface of my Apple Pencil?</b></p>
<p>A: We’ll examine each piece and make
sure that each ALUM Case is
shipped free from imperfections that could damage your Apple Pencil. </p>
<p>The inner diameter of the ALUM is
just 0.1 mm wider than the diameter of the Apple Pencil. Our prototypes show
that this is the perfect size to ensure that the Apple Pencil fits easily into the ALUM Case without any play at the tip when you write and draw. However, we do recommend that you
take care to insert your Apple Pencil into the ALUM at a straight angle.</p>
<p><b>Q: What are the dimensions of the
ALUM? Will it be comfortable for writing and drawing?</b></p>
<p>A: The ALUM Case is 12 mm in diameter. You might compare it to the thickness of a high quality
pen. In our opinion, the hexagonal sides and the increased diameter of the ALUM
make holding and using the Apple Pencil more enjoyable. We find that the flat bevels reduce fatigue when writing and drawing by giving more support to our hands than the rounded barrel of the Apple Pencil.</p>

</div></div>","The ALUM Case is a hexagonal, solid aluminum case for
the Apple Pencil crafted to resemble the graphite pencils that we know and
love. We chose aluminum because it’s strong and light. The hexagonal shape
gives support to your hand when you pick it up and keeps it from rolling away when you put it down. It’s perfect for keeping your
Apple Pencil protected and pristine while still allowing you to write and draw effortlessly.
We love the use of
aluminum in Apple products and we wanted to bring the same look and feel to the
Apple Pencil. 
We’ll craft the ALUM Case from
solid, high quality, 6000 series aluminum stock that will undergo an
anodization process to ensure that the surface is resistant to scratches and
other corrosive elements (sweat!). Anodization will also allow us to offer the
ALUM in silver, grey and gold so you’ll be able to match your ALUM Case with
your iPad Pro.




CNC machining allows us to fabricate the ALUM Case to
tightly specified tolerances, allowing
the Pencil a snug fit, while also keeping easy it to slip on and off. 
Each piece is individually turned in a CNC lathe before sand blasting. During the sandblasting process, special care will be taken to smooth out
the interior barrel surfaces to make
sure it’s free from burrs and other imperfections. 
The taper of
the ALUM Case will be hand polished to a mirror finish before anodizing for protection and color. We
think the polished metal luster contrasts nicely against the matte finish
of the barrel. 
The fitment of end cap of the ALUM is designed with rubber o-rings so it remains
tight and secure when in place while remaining easy
to remove with a simple twist and tug. The ALUM logo is laser
etched onto the side and stamped onto
the end of the cap.

We looked at the lead times and logistics involved in etching individual ALUM Cases and found it to be a nice, workable option to be able to offer our supporters.

<p><b>What
is ‘safe love’?</b></p>
<p>A
mobile App that helps you know beforehand if your sex partner is HIV infected.</p>
<p><b>How
to use this App?</b></p>
<p>Download
the app.</p>
<p>Enter
your personal details.</p>
<p>If
you are HIV positive, update ‘Safe love’ status as positive.</p>
<p><b>How
can I update the status to HIV ‘negative’?</b></p>
<p>A
user cannot do that by himself/herself. There are laboratories associated with
‘safe love’ authorized to do it. Only these labs can update the status to
negative.</p>
<p><b>How
can I locate a Lab associated with ‘safe love’?</b></p>
<p>A
user can locate the nearest Lab with just one click. There are laboratories
associated with ‘safe love’ all over the world.</p>
<p><b>How
can I update my ‘safe love’ status through these labs?</b></p>
<p>Submit
your ‘safe love’ ID to the Lab.</p>
<p>Give
the Lab permission to update your status.</p>
<p>Complete
a one minute photo verification.</p>
<p>Give
blood sample for testing.</p>
<p>Lab
will update the user’s status based on the test result.</p>
<p><b>How
can a user know the ‘safe love’ status of another user?</b></p>
<p>You
can make a request via messaging apps or ‘safe love’ app.</p>
<p>If
that person gives permission, ‘safe love’ status of that person can be viewed.</p>
<p><b>Does
this app provide the status of other sexual diseases which are likely to transmit
from a sex partner?</b></p>
<p>Not
at present. But this feature will be added soon.</p>
<p><b>What
is the advantage of this application?</b></p>
<p>The
habit of using this App before entering into relationships that may lead to
sexual activity will help you avoid HIV infection.</p>
<p>You
can find outa person’s HIV infection status in a respectable and reliable way without
hurting the feelings of the other person.</p>
<p><b>Who
is behind this application?</b></p>
<p>Four
friends from India.</p>
<p><b>At
what stage is ‘safe love’ app now?</b></p>
<p>Developed
and ready for use with 3 operating systems.</p>
<p><b>Why
are we now coming to you?</b></p>
<p>The
App requires the most efficient and safe hosting. Physical verification of
thousands of Labs associated with ‘safe love’ is also very important. We are
here toraise fundsto meet these requirements.</p>
<p><b>How
much do we need?</b></p>$86,400<br/>**************************************************<br/><h1><br/></h1><h1>Let
love be transparent.</h1><br/><p>Have you ever
contemplated a situation where you develop a relationship that leads to sex
with another person and unfortunately the other person happens to be AIDS
infected? <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What if we make love
with that person unaware of his /her infection only to find out later that we
too have fallen victim to that horrible curse? </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This danger lay hidden
in any sexual contact, not just marital relations or love affairs.</span></p>
<p>In most cases a person
gets infected with AIDS due to not being aware that the partner is infected. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Most people won’t ask
this question to a person they are likely to have sex with: ‘Are you HIV
positive?’ </b> The question may be raised in
a joking style, but nobody takes it seriously. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We do not ask because
we fear that he/she may take it as an insult.</span></p>
<p><b>If we set this fear
aside and dare to ask, the answer most likely will be ‘No. I am not HIV
infected’. It does not mean they are infected or not, but rather they are not
aware of it. Probably they never had to take a test for HIV before.</b></p>
<p>It is shocking to
learn that some HIV infected persons, even though a very small percentage,
purposely try to spread this virus to as many people as they can.  Just 3 weeks back, such an incident was
reported in India. A 33 year old man passed on AIDS to about 300 people, including
many house wives. It is really very cruel and sadistic.</p>
<p>Ask the vital
question:<b> “How to prevent AIDS?”</b> and the answer you get from the society around
you will be: “Safe sex”. The one and only way any one can suggest to ensure
safe sex is to use a condom. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Oral or similar
deviations of sex are not totally safe either. There also the chances of
getting infected are high. Therefore the use of condom alone cannot safeguard
you from the possibility of HIV infection.</span></p>
<p>What is the sure
solution t<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">hen?</span></p>
<p><b>Never engage in sexual
contact with HIV infected persons. In other words, before going in for sexual
activity, convince yourself, using a respectable and reliable method, that your
partner is not HIV infected.</b></p>
<p>We thought  and discussed the possibilities of developing such a
system. And from these dreams, the concept of ’Safelove’ application was born.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449220646/qyowyd9tdiwyxpb9qpet.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How does this application

<p><b>Why do we  approach
you?</b></p>
<p>Safe love’ app for all Operating Systems are already developed. Several
people selected for testing this app are now using it.  But before we present this application to
users worldwide, we have to take care of some very important factors.</p>
<p>Privacy and security are the two main
factors. No one would like reveal to the public their personal information and
the details of their illness. Therefore we intend to encrypt all data,
including the Names and personal information and maintain highest level of
privacy.</p>
<p>Another important factor is security. To assure total security and
excellence in performance levels of the application, we are hosting this app in
the best available cloud sever. All the security devices available today are
incorporated in ‘Safe love’.</p>
<p>A very important part of security measures is the physical verification of
the recognition certificates and performance of laboratories willing to be
associated with ‘Safe love’. We know that the purpose of this App will not be
fulfilled if we tie up with only a few labs in some areas only. Our idea is to
have an associate lab in every place where ‘Safe love’ app is used. We do not
give approval to every lab that submits request. We strive to identify the best
in quality and performance among these labs and give approval only to the labs
that meet our quality criteria. Much human effort is to be employed in order to
facilitate this.</p>
<p>Naturally, all this
will cost a lot of money. We have only limited resources and the huge sum of
money that this project demands is beyond our capacity. If all of you come up
with generous support, we can present before the world this very useful
Application in a matter of few days. We request all kind hearted people to
extend support.</p>
<p><b>How
much funds are we expecting to raise?</b></p>
<p>86400
USD.  Working capital for one year.We assure that, within this one year, we can build yie up
relations with laboratories in important towns all over the world and develop
excellent level of performance.</p>
<p><b>How
will we utilize your money?</b></p>
<p>Application
development is complete and ready. Next step is ‘hosting’. $ 1500 for that.</p>
<p>Another
critically important thing to do is to physically verify he registration
certificates of associating Labs and to verify by video call that the labs
applying for association are really functional and the facilities they claim to
have are really available. Three of us are working on this project now and it
is estimated that about 20 persons are needed to work full time.  Calculating @ $300 per month per person, we
will have to keep a reserve of $86400 for 30 people for 12 months.</p>
<p>High
speed internet is essential - $ 3000 for one year </p>

at a glance.
What
is ‘safe love’?
A
mobile App that helps you know beforehand if your sex partner is HIV infected.
How
to use this App?
Download
the app.
Enter
your personal details.
If
you are HIV positive, update ‘Safe love’ status as positive.
How
can I update the status to HIV ‘negative’?
A
user cannot do that by himself/herself. There are laboratories associated with
‘safe love’ authorized to do it. Only these labs can update the status to
negative.
How
can I locate a Lab associated with ‘safe love’?
A
user can locate the nearest Lab with just one click. There are laboratories
associated with ‘safe love’ all over the world.
How
can I update my ‘safe love’ status through these labs?
Submit
your ‘safe love’ ID to the Lab.
Give
the Lab permission to update your status.
Complete
a one minute photo verification.
Give
blood sample for testing.
Lab
will update the user’s status based on the test result.
How
can a user know the ‘safe love’ status of another user?
You
can make a request via messaging apps or ‘safe love’ app.
If
that person gives permission, ‘safe love’ status of that person can be viewed.
Does
this app provide the status of other sexual diseases which are likely to transmit
from a sex partner?
Not
at present. But this feature will be added soon.
What
is the advantage of this application?
The
habit of using this App before entering into relationships that may lead to
sexual activity will help you avoid HIV infection.
You
can find outa person’s HIV infection status in a respectable and reliable way without
hurting the feelings of the other person.
Who
is behind this application?
Four
friends from India.
At
what stage is ‘safe love’ app now?
Developed
and ready for use with 3 operating systems.
Why
are we now coming to you?
The
App requires the most efficient and safe hosting. Physical verification of
thousands of Labs associated with ‘safe love’ is also very important. We are
here toraise fundsto meet these requirements.
How
much do we need?$86,400**************************************************Let
love be transparent.Have you ever
contemplated a situation where you develop a relationship that leads to sex
with another person and unfortunately the other person happens to be AIDS
infected? What if we make love
with that person unaware of his /her infection only to find out later that we
too have fallen victim to that horrible curse? This danger lay hidden
in any sexual contact, not just marital relations or love affairs.
In most cases a person
gets infected with AIDS due to not being aware that the partner is infected. Most people won’t ask
this question to a person they are likely to have sex with: ‘Are you HIV
positive?’  The question may be raised in
a joking style, but nobody takes it seriously. We do not ask because
we fear that he/she may take it as an insult.
If we set this fear
aside and dare to ask, the answer most likely will be ‘No. I am not HIV
infected’. It does not mean they are infected or not, but rather they are not
aware of it. Probably they never had to take a test for HIV before.
It is shocking to
learn that some HIV infected persons, even though a very small percentage,
purposely try to spread this virus to as many people as they can.  Just 3 weeks back, such an incident was
reported in India. A 33 year old man passed on AIDS to about 300 people, including
many house wives. It is really very cruel and sadistic.
Ask the vital
question: “How to prevent AIDS?” and the answer you get from the society around
you will be: “Safe sex”. The one and only way any one can suggest to ensure
safe sex is to use a condom. Oral or similar
deviations of sex are not totally safe either. There also the chances of
getting infected are high. Therefore the use of condom alone cannot safeguard
you from the possibility of HIV infection.
What is the sure
solution then?
Never engage in sexual
contact with HIV infected persons. In other words, before going in for sexual
activity, convince yourself, using a respectable and reliable method, that your
partner is not HIV infected.
We thought  and discussed the possibilities of developing such a
system. And from these dreams, the concept of ’Safelove’ application was born.How does this application
work?Download
and install this App and enter the basic information required. You will then be
taken to the home page. The image of home page is given below.Main
features in the homepage - User uploaded photo, users’ personal information and
’Safe love’ ID, HIV infection status indicator.If the
indicator shows ‘not updated’ it means the user, or any of the other devices
in this App, have not added information about HIV positive or negative status.For
the user to update his status as positive:This application has an
option to mark, while entering  basic information, if the user is HIV
positive. This changes the indicator status to positive.What if the user wishes to
change the status to HIV negative?In the ‘safe love’ App, no user can change
his own status to negative.There are several highly efficient, responsible and recognized hospitals
and laboratories associated with ‘Safe love’. Only these institutions can
conduct an Elisa test on a user and update his/her status as positive or
negative. We
requested many Laboratories in cities of America and Canada to participate in
this movement to prevent AIDS by conducting Elisa tests on ‘Safe love’ users
and updating their status. The response received really was surprising.  Every lab we approached happily consented to
participate and many of them offered to conduct the Elisa tests for ‘safe love’
users at much discounted rates.Now, let’s see how a user can get his
status updated by a laboratory. 









 ‘Safe love’ application has the facility that
allows the user to search and find approved laboratories around his place. Using this facility user can
easily search for the nearest Lab. The search result will be displayed like
this:Once he/she reaches the selected lab, he/she has to submit a request for the Elisa test and give his/her ‘safe love’ ID. He/she will receive the following notification on their ‘Safe
love’ App.“X laboratory
situated at X requests consent to update your ‘Safe love’ status”. 
He/she can issue or
deny them permission. The notification provides an option to do that. The lab
cannot update the status without your consent. They cannot even view your profile.

If he/she gives consent to update the status, the next
step is to take a blood test. A photo verification is required before taking the blood sample for
testing. This is to assure that photo given in the profile is of the same
person. Once the verification is done, then on the user cannot delete the photo
from his/her profile.  After that an accurate blood test will be conducted
and depending on the result, positive or negative, the status will be updated
by the laboratory authority.


100% accurate and reliable HIV status of the user will be displayed in the
homepage.
Next,  how a user can view the ‘Safe love’ status of another user.
If I wish to view the profile of another user and check his HIV status, I
have to forward a request to that person, through instant messaging apps like
‘WhatsApp’ or social media sites like ‘Facebook’ or by e-mail, using the
feature provided in ‘safe love’ App. Alternately, If I can get the safe love ID
from that person, I can directly obtain his ‘safe love’ status from my ‘safe love’
application.


When a person  submit a request for another person’s status, that person receives a
notification in his/her safe love app. 


That notification contains options for him
to accept or reject my request. If he chooses to reject, the person will not be able to
view his status or profile. If  request is accepted, person will get access to his
profile and can check his safe love status. he/she can find out when his status was
last updated. If I find the update very old, I can request for a fresh update.


‘Safe love’ will reveal the status of a user to another user taking extreme
precautions to maintain total security and the privacy of the user.
The habit of exchanging the ‘Safe love’ status before any sexual relation
will help considerably reduce the spreading of HIV infection. Insisting on
‘Safe love’ status in sexual relations will protect you from deadly HIV
infection.
We present this application mainly for two types of people.
One for those people who believe that a few minutes pleasure should not
cause destruction of our lives due to HIV infection.
For those who believe that one should not become the cause of AIDS
infection to a person who trustfully gives love and pleasure.
We strongly believe that these two categories of people will take this App
to their heart and use it to safe guard their own life and the life of others.

<p>Hello, INDIEGOGO! My name is Marat and today I’d like to present you my new project called <b>ANYROOM charger</b>.</p>
<p><b>ANYROOM charger</b> is a portable multi-charger docking station able to charge two devices simultaneously, no matter where it is placed. </p>

<p>Everyone has electronic devices that need to be charged from time to time. The idea of <b>AR charger</b> is unbelievably simple: you don’t have to use dozens of wires and docks at home anymore – you can choose one <b>AR charger</b> responsible for charging all necessary devices.

<p>With <b>AR charger</b> it doesn’t matter where you are. You simply enjoy your daily routine while your favorite gadget is autonomously charged by <b>AR charger</b> – and that gives you an opportunity to have your device with you whenever you need it. You don’t have to waste money on expensive wires for charging various gadgets. <b>AR charger</b> will definitely take care of that for you.</p>

<p>You can be in a hall reading e-mails, go to the kitchen and look for recipes online, move to the bathroom and listen to relaxing tunes, work at the desk and answer work e-mails, stay in the children’s room to watch cartoons or enjoy a new book in a chaise longue by the swimming pool. The best thing is that now you’ve got a chance to do all of the above while your devices are being charged. </p>

You don’t have to waste money on expensive wires for charging various gadgets. AR charger will definitely take care of that for you.

The best thing is that now you’ve got a chance to do all of the above while your devices are being charged. 


On this great day I’d like to ask for your help in supporting further development of this project.
   



Why are there two Indiegogo campaigns?
It’s rather simple. At this moment, it’s impossible to ascertain the full price of the complete AR charger, that’s why I can only make assumptions. The full price of the charger will be known as soon as I create the final prototype (case + electronic filling). And I still need investment for developing the final prototype. The first campaign will help raise funds for creating the final prototype and define the total price of the model. The second campaign is needed for investment into mass production of the charger. Moreover, the rewards from the first campaign will be taken into consideration during the second campaign, which means that investors will get all promised discounts and bonuses. Make a deposit now and you’ll get AR charger for a unique price.
Why does it take so long to release AR charger (est. August 2017)?
I prefer to play it safe to make sure I maintain the trust of my backers by providing a more realistic release deadline. I could have set an earlier date with the minimal buffer for potential development issues, but would rather stick to a more viable date.




Where will the money from the first campaign go?
58% - development of logo and brand, as well as further work on design and structure of AR charger. 
32% - development of electronic constituents of AR charger.
5% - creating the final prototype (case + electronic filling).
10% - Indiegogo fee.


   


AR charger allows you to use Apple Lightning to USB cable and Apple USB Power Adapter, which protects your device from problems occurring due to incompatibility or device safety settings. Apple Lightning to USB Cable is provided with significant protection from wear and physical damage by being put into the case of AR charger.Devices are charged thanks to a docking station with an embedded battery.



The docking station with an embedded battery gets energy from a charging platform connected to the electrical network.


Don’t waste your money on dozens of wires. One AR charger is enough for charging various devices you have in different rooms. What’s more, it uses less space and reduces clutter.
Charging two devices simultaneously. Extra USB port for charging an extra third gadget.





Maximum compatibility. AR charger is compatible with most cases.
Easy access to device while charging. AR charger holds the device upright for you to be able to dial video calls, send text and e-mail, check notifications, etc.

<h1>Update</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The maker community has felt that we require some changes in our current prototype before HackPOD becomes a full-fledged product. We acknowledge the mistakes on our part and appreciate all the support that the community has provided us.</p>
<p>We are making a new prototype satisfying the needs and recommendations of the community. So we have refunded all our backers who backed the current version of HackPOD.</p>
<p>As part of Team HackPOD, we express our deepest gratitude to all the contributors of our campaign. By now, all your refunds have been probably completed. Do reach out to us if you face any problems with your refund.</p>
<p>HackPOD will launch again, stronger and faster than before. Keep following our blog for all updates.<br/></p>

<h1>What is HackPOD?</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">HackPOD is a powerful microcontroller development platform based on 32 bit ARM Cortex-M4, programmable  in Arduino and C. <br/></span></p>
<div>HackPOD also includes an integrated touchscreen, a memory card slot, an in-built protoboard and SMT space and a rechargeable battery, all within a portable smartphone form factor.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>HackPOD caters to the needs of hobbyists, students and engineers by presenting them with much more power and ease. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464717961/Indiegogo_views_final_wgjdiz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/>
</div>
<div><b>MUST READ : </b></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> The above images are just HackPOD's current prototype. There will be minor changes  in the consumer version (like solder mask colour, smoother PCB edges etc.). It will be more aesthetic and robust at final. We will keep you updated.</div>
<div>
<br/>
</div>
<h1>Special Features</h1>
<br/><br/>
<div>
<b>Touchscreen LCD:</b> HackPOD features an integrated 3.2 inch touchscreen display of resolution 240 X 320. The screen is of the optimum size for portable projects like wearable gadgets.  </div>

</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Rechargeable Battery:</b> Have you always envisioned completely wireless projects running without any external power source? We have included a 1800 mAh 3.7V Li-Po battery just for that.</span><strong><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464793255/Memory_and_Power_lghhoa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<strong></strong>
<br/></strong>
</div>
<strong>Arduino compatible:  </strong>HackPOD is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. All your existing Arduino codes will work on HackPOD. You can also program in C language.<br/>
<div>
<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>HackPOD API:</b> Based on Henning Karlsen's open source UTFT library, the HackPOD API is designed to make controlling the touchscreen and memory card completely hassle-free.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b><br/>In-built Breadboard:</b> Say goodbye to messy wiring. Build your prototypes and connect breakout modules and Arduino shields on the HackPOD breadboard itself. The clean circuits will make debugging projects a walk in the park.</div>
<div>
<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Integrated SMT space:</b> We have included an SMT space on HackPOD for pro hackers who want to solder their breakouts, . Ours is the only microcontroller platform with plug and play support for SMT breakout modules such as RFM22B/23B.</div>
<div>
<br/><br/><b>On-board Digital-to-Analog Converter pin:</b> HackPOD provides an  on-board DAC pin. Use it for a signal generator, an oscilloscope or in any other way you envisage.

</div>
<p></p>
<h1>Why use HackPOD?</h1>
<div>
<br/><br/>
</div> <p><b>Most Economical LCD Touchscreen Integration:</b> Integrating an LCD touchscreen with available microcontroller boards in the market is expensive and limits all connecting pins, thereby making DIY projects involving LCDs very difficult. HackPOD brings you LCD touchscreen integration at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Portability:</b> HackPOD is the only development platform with a 
smartphone form factor, so that any your projects completed with HackPOD
 will look more aesthetic and compact than those on other platforms. The
 device can also be hacked to make wearable products like smartwatches, 
virtual reality headsets and fitness trackers. The only limit is your 
imagination!!!</p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464687092/Light._Portable._Handheld_h2nfee.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><b>Fast and Efficient:</b> The ""brain"" of HackPOD is a 32 bit ARM Cortex-M4 chip, rendering it much more powerful than traditional microcontroller development platforms. Running at a regular clock speed of 72 MHz, it can be safely overclocked to 96 MHz.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Plug and Play:</b> HackPOD's unique design allows seamless connectivity with nearly all breakout boards and Arduino shields available in the market. You can build custom circuits on the integrated protoboard itself. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465910991/Plug_and_Play_indie_xzsa6k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<b>Battery Power:</b> HackPOD makes it possible for your projects to 
work without any external power connection. A single charge of the 
rechargeable battery can last for several days.
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Memory:</b> HackPOD's expandable memory provides plenty of extra storage space for your code.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>SDIO Card Support: </b>HackPOD's memory card slot supports SDIO 1.0 cards. Add extra functionality to your projects using GPS, Wi-Fi, Ethernet or Camera SDIO cards. HackPOD also supports Electric Imp out of the box.

</div></div>","Update

The maker community has felt that we require some changes in our current prototype before HackPOD becomes a full-fledged product. We acknowledge the mistakes on our part and appreciate all the support that the community has provided us.
We are making a new prototype satisfying the needs and recommendations of the community. So we have refunded all our backers who backed the current version of HackPOD.
As part of Team HackPOD, we express our deepest gratitude to all the contributors of our campaign. By now, all your refunds have been probably completed. Do reach out to us if you face any problems with your refund.
HackPOD will launch again, stronger and faster than before. Keep following our blog for all updates.

What is HackPOD?

HackPOD is a powerful microcontroller development platform based on 32 bit ARM Cortex-M4, programmable  in Arduino and C. 
HackPOD also includes an integrated touchscreen, a memory card slot, an in-built protoboard and SMT space and a rechargeable battery, all within a portable smartphone form factor.

HackPOD caters to the needs of hobbyists, students and engineers by presenting them with much more power and ease. 


MUST READ : 


Disclaimer: The above images are just HackPOD's current prototype. There will be minor changes  in the consumer version (like solder mask colour, smoother PCB edges etc.). It will be more aesthetic and robust at final. We will keep you updated.



Special Features


Touchscreen LCD: HackPOD features an integrated 3.2 inch touchscreen display of resolution 240 X 320. The screen is of the optimum size for portable projects like wearable gadgets.  




Portable Smartphone Form Factor: The complete HackPOD device consisting of the microcontroller logic board, touchscreen and battery is shaped like a smartphone to make your projects compact, sleek and portable. 



Memory Card Slot: The HackPOD board has a memory card slot which supports SD, SDHC and SDIO cards. Your code will never run out of storage space again!!



 


Rechargeable Battery: Have you always envisioned completely wireless projects running without any external power source? We have included a 1800 mAh 3.7V Li-Po battery just for that.



Arduino compatible:  HackPOD is fully compatible with the Arduino IDE. All your existing Arduino codes will work on HackPOD. You can also program in C language.




HackPOD API: Based on Henning Karlsen's open source UTFT library, the HackPOD API is designed to make controlling the touchscreen and memory card completely hassle-free.








In-built Breadboard: Say goodbye to messy wiring. Build your prototypes and connect breakout modules and Arduino shields on the HackPOD breadboard itself. The clean circuits will make debugging projects a walk in the park.




Integrated SMT space: We have included an SMT space on HackPOD for pro hackers who want to solder their breakouts, . Ours is the only microcontroller platform with plug and play support for SMT breakout modules such as RFM22B/23B.

On-board Digital-to-Analog Converter pin: HackPOD provides an  on-board DAC pin. Use it for a signal generator, an oscilloscope or in any other way you envisage.

On-board uFL antenna connector: Need greater communication range for your projects? Just hop an antenna on our on-board uFL mount.



Why use HackPOD?


 Most Economical LCD Touchscreen Integration: Integrating an LCD touchscreen with available microcontroller boards in the market is expensive and limits all connecting pins, thereby making DIY projects involving LCDs very difficult. HackPOD brings you LCD touchscreen integration at a very reasonable price.

Portability: HackPOD is the only development platform with a 
smartphone form factor, so that any your projects completed with HackPOD
 will look more aesthetic and compact than those on other platforms. The
 device can also be hacked to make wearable products like smartwatches, 
virtual reality headsets and fitness trackers. The only limit is your 
imagination!!!






Fast and Efficient: The ""brain"" of HackPOD is a 32 bit ARM Cortex-M4 chip, rendering it much more powerful than traditional microcontroller development platforms. Running at a regular clock speed of 72 MHz, it can be safely overclocked to 96 MHz.

Plug and Play: HackPOD's unique design allows seamless connectivity with nearly all breakout boards and Arduino shields available in the market. You can build custom circuits on the integrated protoboard itself. 





Battery Power: HackPOD makes it possible for your projects to 
work without any external power connection. A single charge of the 
rechargeable battery can last for several days.

Memory: HackPOD's expandable memory provides plenty of extra storage space for your code.

SDIO Card Support: HackPOD's memory card slot supports SDIO 1.0 cards. Add extra functionality to your projects using GPS, Wi-Fi, Ethernet or Camera SDIO cards. HackPOD also supports Electric Imp out of the box.

<h3>The project is only 15 days!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://powertank.frenchkiss.jp/IMB_tCEKhE.GIF"" src=""""/><br/>How many watts is your battery output?</h3>
<p><strong>[POWER TANK]</strong> is the latest high-powered mobile battery that can charge laptops and smartphones at a maximum power of 100W. Please experience high-speed charging that is different from conventional quick charging!  As the name “Plain Edition”, the design is very simple black. We believe that simplicity is the best design. By making the design plain, I was able to stick to the performance as a gadget. Also, by cutting costs significantly, you can get the latest mobile battery with 100W output for less than 100USD in this project only! (SUPER EARLY BIRD)</p>

The most important point when choosing a mobile battery is the output. This is because the device that can be charged depends on the output. Is your battery labeled 5V/1A or 5V/2A?  In this case, the output is 5W to 10W, and only small devices such as smartphones can be charged. ""POWER TANK"" has a USB type C (POWER DELIVERY) charging port with a maximum output of 100W. ""POWER TANK""can charge up to a 15-inch MacBook Pro. There is also 2 USB ports that can be charged at quick! “POWER TANK” USB-C port can also be input. Because it is a maximum of 100W input, the charging time of the ""POWER TANK"" main unit is fast and there is no stress.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571848284/f7ddqjcorqged24ynfqt.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://powertank.frenchkiss.jp/IMB_yXHOGd.GIF"" src=""""/><br/><strong>[Charging to iPhone] </strong>For example, if you use the “POWER TANK” original USC-C to Lightning cable to charge iPhoneX, It can charge up tp more than 80% in about 30-40 minutes.

Charging of MacBookPro 15 inch is specified up to 87 W, so when charging using ""POWER TANK"" with 100 W output, charging from a household outlet using a genuine Apple adapter It will be the same performance!

[POWER TANK] is the latest high-powered mobile battery that can charge laptops and smartphones at a maximum power of 100W. Please experience high-speed charging that is different from conventional quick charging!  As the name “Plain Edition”, the design is very simple black. We believe that simplicity is the best design. By making the design plain, I was able to stick to the performance as a gadget. Also, by cutting costs significantly, you can get the latest mobile battery with 100W output for less than 100USD in this project only! (SUPER EARLY BIRD)

We recommend the ""POWER TANK"" to those who fall into these categories!
[Output and input] Portable batteries are a familiar item for many people now. The most important point when choosing a mobile battery is the output. This is because the device that can be charged depends on the output. Is your battery labeled 5V/1A or 5V/2A?  In this case, the output is 5W to 10W, and only small devices such as smartphones can be charged. ""POWER TANK"" has a USB type C (POWER DELIVERY) charging port with a maximum output of 100W. ""POWER TANK""can charge up to a 15-inch MacBook Pro. There is also 2 USB ports that can be charged at quick! “POWER TANK” USB-C port can also be input. Because it is a maximum of 100W input, the charging time of the ""POWER TANK"" main unit is fast and there is no stress.[Charging to iPhone] For example, if you use the “POWER TANK” original USC-C to Lightning cable to charge iPhoneX, It can charge up tp more than 80% in about 30-40 minutes. If it's a  5V/1A battery, it takes about 3 hours. In various everyday situations, there are times when the battery should not run out. “POWER TANK”, which can charge various devices at quick, will be a must-have item for everyone![Charging to MacBook Pro] For example, if you use the “POWER TANK” original USC-C to USB-C cable to charge 15-inch MacBook Pro, it can be charged to over 80% in about 1 and a half hours. In the image above you can see 100W power supply. Charging of MacBookPro 15 inch is specified up to 87 W, so when charging using ""POWER TANK"" with 100 W output, charging from a household outlet using a genuine Apple adapter It will be the same performance! The ability to charge a laptop at the same speed as a household outlet is a great attraction anywhere in the world.[All Charging ports can be used simultaneously] All charging ports of “POWER TANK” can be used simultaneously. Charge your various devices and gadgets at the same time![Cables] It doesn't make sense to have a high-powered battery unless you have a cable that supports it. It is also true that many people do not know this unexpectedly. In almost cases, cables are sold separately. But ""POWER TANK"" includes a USB-C/USB-C cable for 100W and a USB-C/Lightning cable for 18W output! Especially for Apple users, it will be attractive. Of course, the two genuine cables included are data transfer compatible cables, so they can be used for various purposes such as connecting to an external hard disk, not only for charging, but also for synchronization and backup of iPhone and laptop.[Capacity] We surveyed friends and family, but many people have batteries around 10,000mAh. When choosing a battery, another important thing is capacity. ""POWER TANK"" has a capacity of 20,000mAh. Simply charge iPhoneX 5-6 times. In addition, various devices can be charged.[Available on board] And of course, you can bring it on board. You can bring “POWER TANK” anywhere in the world. It can also be used on board.[Simple and Cool plain design] We believe that “simple is the greatest design”. As the name ""POWER TANK -Plain Edition-"", the design is plain black. This has dramatically improved cost performance.
[Overwhelming cost performance] Currently, 100W output batteries of other companies released by overseas manufacturers are circulating at a price of around $150, cables for high output are also sold separately It is around $20 dollars per one.

This national economic crisis is created by aging boomers as their family members try to remain employed and provide care. The Care Companion App accesses resources for those caring and working individuals to reduce the time, money and frustration involved in finding suitable solutions.
 
About 30% of American employees are juggling a job and family caregiving responsibilities, but their employers do almost nothing to support them.Although it may seem like a money-saving plan, ultimately this costs the company money. Work-life balance is one thing. Employee-caregiver balance takes it to a whole new level. They are always feeling like they don’t give enough to their aging parent, and pulling up short at work, too.Opportunities for promotions, extra projects, and new assignments on the job are just a no-go. They know they have to get across town to the pharmacy before it closes to get mom’s new prescription. And the doctor’s appointments, scheduling nightmares, calls to Medicare just suck your soul right out of you!It causes so much stress that employee-caregivers: 
Take part-time jobs with fewer hours
Use their vacation time and their own sick days
Take leaves of absence
Ultimately leave the workforce earlier than they would otherwise
More than 10,000 Baby Boomers have their 65th birthday every day in America. Most Baby Boomers prefer to stay in their own homes as long as possible as they age. But quite frankly, that means they depend on family members. They rely on family members who are already employed, have children and their own households to manage. These volunteer caregivers are stretched thin and burned out.Let’s face it, family members losing their independence due to aging or illness do not have the ability to do what we call Activities of Daily Living like:
Cooking
Chores
Transportation
Legal and Financial management
And many, many more!
Family caregivers, who have their own jobs and other responsibilities, end up taking these on. So, families juggle the responsibilities themselves and try not to complain. All in the name of love. Usually, families try to manage to care for their loved ones alone. They spend hours, sometimes when they should be at work, coordinating care for aging family members. In the beginning, the average 20 or more hours weekly.  As age and care needs increase caregiving evolves into a full-time job. And this care cycle is, on average, 5 ½ years long.The constant struggle to juggle full-time work, caregiving, and other obligations are physically and mentally exhausting. It is not unusual for these employed caregivers to end up in the hospital themselves. The government is not funding any social services for caregiving problems. Employee-caregivers are torn between their most productive employee selves and being loyal to their aging family members. They have to choose one between their career and family, that's why they used to quit from a job early and take retirement.The Harvard Business School report explains that the employee turnover, hiring costs, and loss of institutional knowledge cost companies millions of dollars. An AARP study reports that American businesses lose over $33.5 billion, just in productivity. Losses are estimated at $6,000 PER EMPLOYEE (not just employee-caregivers) for each and every organization in the US. Employee-caregiving is not new, but with over 3.5 million Baby Boomers turning 65 every year, this is a crisis for American business. Soon, the majority of the workforce will be burdened with family care responsibilities while they hold a job. Estimates suggest that over 70% of Americans will be responsible for the care of an aging relative at some point. American businesses lose money every day as the workforce dwindles. And taking care of employee-caregivers in organizations is what will make the difference. When the time comes, almost every American will have some responsibility for aging parents. By taking action now, employers can maintain a reliable workforce.

<p>Conventional
devices used to sterilize your smartphone utilize a short UV-A wavelength of
280nm. The advantages of using this wavelength is quick sterilization, but
exposure to the human body can be harmful, which is why these sterilizers
usually encase your device entirely prior to sterilizing. </p>
<p>Because
of this, this wavelength is strictly regulated and photo-biological (light
wavelength) certification must be received through an accredited agency to
verify the devices stability. Strict regulations require vigorous testing for
certification and these products should be used with caution.</p>

<p>It's
become an age where smartphones are needed everywhere, including your
workplace. Companies are unable to progress or develop with the use of
smartphones and the first thing people grab in the morning or put down right
before sleeping is their smartphone. It's the closest thing to you and stays
next to you at all times.</p>
<p>Many
people have heard that their smartphones may contain more germs than a toilet,
but not do realize how serious the effects may be.</p>

<p>If an
article in the newspaper or a broadcast on the TV reports on it, there may be a
brief thought of concern in passing, and then back to using your smartphone.
But the problem is more serious than imagined. It was reported some time ago
that around 90 people died from the flu in Hong Kong and dozens died from a
deadly bacteria in the United States. It was reported that the smartphones
ability to spread infectious bacteria and diseases contributed to this.<br/></p>

<p>Most
healthy adults can withstand coming in contact with bacteria or germs and do so
on a regular basis daily. But there are always young children, adults with weak
immune systems, and the elderly that was must think about as well. Especially
with the increase in smart phone use by children and the elderly, this is ever
increasing concern.</p>

<p>Because
of this, many companies have come to realize the risk of germ spreading from
smartphone use and have produced different versions of smartphone sterilizers.
However, these devices are bulky and inconvenient to carry around. As well as
emitting harmful rays inside their casing. We have the advantages of being
smaller, extremely portable, and giving you the ability to safely charge and
use your device simultaneously because our sterilizing rays are harmless to the
human body. </p>

A cell phone has 18x more bacteria than a public restroom - FOX NewsHave you ever used a paper towel to open a public bathroom door or used your foot to flush the toilet? Of course, because those things are loaded with germs.

Conventional
devices used to sterilize your smartphone utilize a short UV-A wavelength of
280nm. The advantages of using this wavelength is quick sterilization, but
exposure to the human body can be harmful, which is why these sterilizers
usually encase your device entirely prior to sterilizing. 
Because
of this, this wavelength is strictly regulated and photo-biological (light
wavelength) certification must be received through an accredited agency to
verify the devices stability. Strict regulations require vigorous testing for
certification and these products should be used with caution.










AntiBac
uses a longer infrared wavelength that is above the harmful UV range. AntiBac
is certified IEC62471 and is the world's first sterilizer/charger that is
harmless to the human body.




Existing sterilizers out there are cradles
that encase your entire phone, which prevent use while sterilizing. The light
that emits from these devices can be harmful to your eyes or skin. Also, phone
sizes differ, and these case type sterilizers cannot accommodate for all
devices.




AntiBac
can be used for any model, at any time, whether the phone is in use or not.
It's certified to be harmless to the human body and will continue to sterilize
your device even when in use.

Q20 features an LED light suited for these tasks with 7 output levels, makes it perfect for still or video shootings.





Rectangular Shaped, Able to StandQ20 has a rectangular outline with flat sides, which makes it easy to stand or position itself in any orientation. It is especially useful in setting up off-camera lighting.


With Tripod MountFurthermore, a built-in female 1/4” receptacle is included, which allows it to be attached on a tripod.



Camera Support
FlashQ transmitter can work on most cameras with standard ISO hot shoe mount. It supports remote triggering flashes at sync speeds up to 1/250 sec*. The trigger signal is barely on the central contact of standard ISO hot shoe. No TTL information is transmitted by FlashQ. This makes FlashQ compatible with most cameras.



Multiple Flashes Support
Q20 equips with the same FlashQ radio, which features Automatic Clear Channel Selection and Simple Pair-up. 
FlashQ System can support up to 8 flashes (Q20 main bodies) simultaneously, provided that those flashes had been paired up with the FlashQ transmitter. This gives the scalability of multiple wireless flashes and makes your photography more creative.

NomenclatureFlashQ Wireless Flash TriggerThis is our first crowdfunded campaign in 2014. It shares the same transmitter with Q20 flash. So FlashQ system supports remote triggering both Q20 flash and third-party flashes.(Buy Now)Risks and challengesWe are really excited about launching this full featured, handy flash. The full-functional prototype demonstration ensures a wonderful experience for our backers. We have finished most of the engineering work, design validation and preparation for mold tooling with our manufacturing partners.Lighting performance is the most important aspect of a flash. We’ve lined up a well qualified optics manufacturer for the Fresnel lens design and tooling. We assure that Q20 shall have the optimum lighting quality.We learned a lot through the journey of our previous project, and proved that our team is able to let our first idea evolve to the final product. We've further strengthened our supply chain this year, and we are confident to deliver on rewards. However, there are factors out of our expectation, so, while we may not be able to promise 100% accuracy on delivery date, we promise complete transparency. We are committed to keep our backers posted.Media kit is here.",18.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Dev OS is not only innovative operating system, but also a pretty promising start-up. Unfortunately, the creators of the project do not have enough funds for its development. We can only help you - people who are interested in the development of technology. We are donating even small amounts to help the development of technology, particularly mobile.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The required amount of 22.000$ will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying programmers</li>
<li>Rent small office</li>
<li>Additional research</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Lease of production equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that the funds will be collected and we can make something amazing!</p>
<p>For donations, even minor, you'll be rewarded with access to early testing of the operating system, and people who have paid significant amounts expect big gifts!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the target fundraising is reached by 1/3, we will send the money to the Children's home No. 3 for orphans in Minsk. If the target fundraising is reached at 2/3, we will begin to work on the Dev OS, but without adequate funding the project will be delayed for a long time. If the goal is to raise funds will be fully achieved, we will immediately start developing a Dev OS!</p>
<p>In case of failure of the project, the remaining money will also go to Children's home No. 3 for orphans.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Our project is unique in its kind, there are plenty of similar projects. But our project stands out among the rest that he offers you something different, what you've all been waiting for.</p>
<p>Dev OS will give you full freedom in the settings area of the device, but not at the expense of convenience and ease of use! However, you will be provided with a truly impressive set of software and modifications of the system that will allow you to use the device as you see fit. For example, as a multimedia entertainment device, or even as a full-fledged tool for development!</p>
<p>Our project needs people look at the statistics which we collected the last few months:</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank you for taking the time to our project!</strong></p>
</div></div>","Introduction
Dev OS is not only innovative operating system, but also a pretty promising start-up. Unfortunately, the creators of the project do not have enough funds for its development. We can only help you - people who are interested in the development of technology. We are donating even small amounts to help the development of technology, particularly mobile.

What We Need & What You Get
The required amount of 22.000$ will go to:

Paying programmers
Rent small office
Additional research
Advertising
Lease of production equipment

We hope that the funds will be collected and we can make something amazing!
For donations, even minor, you'll be rewarded with access to early testing of the operating system, and people who have paid significant amounts expect big gifts!
 
If the target fundraising is reached by 1/3, we will send the money to the Children's home No. 3 for orphans in Minsk. If the target fundraising is reached at 2/3, we will begin to work on the Dev OS, but without adequate funding the project will be delayed for a long time. If the goal is to raise funds will be fully achieved, we will immediately start developing a Dev OS!
In case of failure of the project, the remaining money will also go to Children's home No. 3 for orphans.

The Impact
Our project is unique in its kind, there are plenty of similar projects. But our project stands out among the rest that he offers you something different, what you've all been waiting for.
Dev OS will give you full freedom in the settings area of the device, but not at the expense of convenience and ease of use! However, you will be provided with a truly impressive set of software and modifications of the system that will allow you to use the device as you see fit. For example, as a multimedia entertainment device, or even as a full-fledged tool for development!
Our project needs people look at the statistics which we collected the last few months:




All these issues say that our operating system to the right people. As ordinary people, and developers.
Our goals:

To give the operating system to those in dire need. For example, developers and people with disabilities.
To narrow the circle of persons who have never installed third-party firmware.
To give common users simple and convenient operating system with all the benefits of Android.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you have no funds that you could to help us, no problem. You can also tell about our project to your friends, colleagues, relatives. Any your help will be very important for us!
If you are a developer and want to participate in creating the Dev OS, write on our Facebook. If you just want to share their ideas, too, please contact us by Facebook!

<p>""Once I met my friend to drink beer and talk. But something went wrong. I was sitting in my armchair and drinking beer glass by glass, I used to try to find interesting topics for conversation , hoping that everything will change. Suddenly I saw a company at the bar.<br/><br/>At that moment I felt a very big sadness, frustration and limitation of my actions because I was afraid to approach them. I felt wild animal fear. Later the idea to create a mobile application Friday appeared.""<br/><i>Dmitry Yaroshevich</i><br/> </p>
<p>We are absolutely sure that by creating a mobile application Friday, we will be able to change the world for the better.

</div></div>","How does it work?
 
First, you need to decide what you are looking for.

If it is a company then you need to go to the list of companies and choose the one that suits you great: a big company or a small one, a tete-a-tete meeting or maybe you want to find your lovely girl. All companies in your town are on the first screen, and you can join any of them. 
If it is a place, you will be able to find it on the map or in the lists of companies. You can also find all the bars, which are relevant today. For example, drinks are free in the bar which is three blocks from you. Intriguing, isn't it? 
If you are looking for people nearby, right now, you only need to rotate your smartphone or connect to the VR and you will see all the people within 500 meters who use the application, also their profile, rating, and preferences that will help you in choosing. 


 
Security
 
Users have a rating, and after each meeting the user can leave a good or bad feedback about it. Thus, uninteresting or dangerous people will be immediately visible to other people. Security of users will be guaranted by bars and only verified places will be included in Friday. All users data are confidential and their contact information such as phone number, social network page and e-mail is transmitted only after confirmation of the meeting if the user specified this information.
 

 
Business focus
 
Friday is an excellent platform for advertising places and events. They can be allocated on the map, searching or using the function ""Offer of the day in your city"". Thus, by opening the application, users will see your place one of the first.
