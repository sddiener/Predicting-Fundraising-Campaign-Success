What is a cat cafe? Glad you asked! A lovely little coffee shop where folks can come and spend time with adoptable kitties while they sip on coffee, tea, juice, and have a snack or a dessert.

We've offially partnered with Friends Of Strays shelter !!!This cafe will house shelter cats, improving their own lives and chance for            adoption as well as opening space in other facilities for cats to go. THIS SAVES  LIVES!




 This is great for so many types of people! We have seniors who may have difficulty caring for a cat in their home. We have college students who may not have pets in dorm rooms or apartments . We have many residents with roommates or significant others and family who are allergic. We have landlords with zero pet policies. We have actors, artists, musicians and athletes passing through town who may need a little stress relief, or may just miss their pets at home. We have tourists. Lots and lots of tourists. If you were in Saint Petersburg on vacation, would you pass up the chance to view and pet cats in Saint Petersburg's first and only cat cafe?! 







Adopting a cat from this cafe allows potential pet parents to play with and get to know cats in a fun and up beat environment instead of a sad and over crowded shelter. According to the ASPCA,  of the cats entering shelters, approximately 41% are euthanized.  52% in Pinellas county. We can do better!


 


The space can also be used to display local art, have open mic nights, bridal showers, birthday parties, office meetings and many other cat friendly events.


 We look forward to working with local coffee shops and restaurants and selling their goods along with our own. Cheesecake, donuts, fruits and other snacks.  Keep it local, St Pete!





What we need money for:

Permits/licences
Two months rent and deposits
Alarm system (for the safety of the cats)
Utilities
Minor construction
insurance
Cat supplies
Furniture
Coffee and snack supplies
Your rewards

THANK YOU!!!  


Remember, if we don't open, the cats get nothing, and its back to the drawing board. 

EVERY Dollar counts!  Let's save some cats together!!!!

<p>At Red Clay Brewing Company, we are made up
of Kerry McGinnis with a background in engineering, Stephen Harle with a background in accounting, and John Corbin with a background in business
and hospitality. </p>
<p>We are three guys with a passion for
craft beer, home brewing, and the whole culture surrounding it.  Red Clay Brewing Company opened in March of this year, and we have successfully opened a taproom
where we are able to serve our local community! We are currently distributing

<p><b>Why Red Clay?</b></p>
<p>As we were in the process of defining
who we are, we asked ourselves, ""What do people think about when they
think of the South?""  Well, with all three of us born and raised here, there is one common thing that is truly southern...RED CLAY!!!  It's
EVERYWHERE!! So naturally we chose Red Clay Brewing Company. Our name
represents what we grew up knowing, and so do our beer labels.  With names
like Big Swamp Stout (Big Swamp deriving from the Muskogee word Opelika), Hop
Jubilee (from the late night Jubilee's we went to off the Eastern Shore of the
Mobile Bay), and Hay Shed Saison (to represent the abundant agriculture around
our state), you can't help but think of that sweet Southern land we call home.</p>
<p><b>Why Opelika?</b></p>
<p>Though we all have ties to historic
Opelika, the three of us have spent time away. Realizing that there is no

<p>     In 2015, with the help of Board Member Logan E. Fahey, I formed Lakeside with the purpose of helping people with obstacles to employment by training and employing them in the landscaping, painting, and janitorial industries.  We've bootstrapped the business on a shoestring budget and were blessed with an incredible first year.  The landscape portion of the company is the most capital intensive of the three segments we serve.  We were only able to purchase older used equipment, which really needs to be replaced with newer equipment in order to continue to provide high quality landscape services and employment for several people with barriers to employment.  Some of these barriers include those with disabilities, returning veterans, and ex-offenders.  This year our primary area of focus is the landscaping part of the business, and we have even renamed that element, calling it New Life Landscaping, to better reflect our mission. We need your help to grow our business and purchase new equipment.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>     We feel it is imperative to let you know where your contributions with go.  We are seeking $10,000 in order to purchase a zero turn mower, trailer, and backpack blower, allowing us to double our capacity and add two new positions. The new positions will be filled by individuals with some obstacle to employment, such as a criminal background, disability, or returning veteran. Last year, we were able to train and employ several full-time and part-time mission employees.  We would like to add to that total, and will require some new equipment in order to accomplish that task.</p>
<p>     We have several rewards available for those donors who meet certain levels of contribution.  Some of these include flower planting, Spring and Fall Clean-ups, a season of lawn mowing, mulching, and a comprehensive landscape service contract for those who live locally.  For those who do not, we offer garden gloves and shovels or plants as token of our appreciation. <i><b>*If you would like to donate your reward to a local charity or disabled person, please let us know and we will accommodate your request.</b></i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>ihiveLIVE 2.0 - <i>Work-in-progress </i></i> </p>
<p>At <i>ihiveLIVE </i>we’re creating a new social media platform that enables you to turn your online activity into funds for those people and causes that are most important to you. We do this in the following manner: <br/><br/>1.) Upon sign up you provide us with two types of information      </p>
<p>     a.) What products you regularly buy and want to receive advertising for, and;              b.) What are the causes you want to support. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443729246/tjmdz269eqseg6eq1zd2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>2.) We will then connect you with online, discussion-based communities where you can discuss those topics you are most passionate about.  Communities such as: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>University Student Bodies and Sororities/Fraternities</li>
<li>Cycling, Running, or other Sporting Organizations</li>
<li>Movie or Book Discussion Groups</li>
<li>Local Charitable and Faith-based Organizations</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<br/>3.) Based upon the advertising revenue that is generated by your online activity  in our communities ( from the tailor-based ads that you receive), we will automatically share 20% of your revenue to the causes that you support and 20% directly to you, the user. Although the funds will initially be small, as a large collective of users come together, we can generate revenue that will have a huge social impact for those causes that each of us care about.<p></p>

<br/>
<p>In a world where everyone wants to share and help others, but not everyone has the financial means or the time to spare, <i>ihiveLIVE</i> plays an important role.  We know that social media can become a powerful tool for social good by simply sharing revenue with users and those causes they believe in. And we believe there are millions of people, just like you, who share our view. </p>

<h3>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Our Perks Reflect ""The Power of Revenue Sharing""</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Our campaign perks reflect what we are all about --- ""the power of sharing"".  In recognition of your financial support we will take 10% of every dollar that you contribute and share it with five worthy charitable organizations that our supporters choose through a voting process. </p>
<p>After you make a contribution you will receive an email with a link to a page with a list of cause related organizations, from which you will vote for those organizations (as many as you’d like) that you would like to see <i>ihiveLIVE</i> support with a percentage of the funds that are raised. At the conclusion of our campaign, we will redirect 10% of all funds to the 5 organizations with the most votes received. <br/></p>
<p>After you contribute you will receive an email from us providing a list of charitable organizations to support (you can add organizations as well) There may be a short delay in receiving our email that allows you to vote. If so, please know we appreciate your patience greatly!</p>
<h3>Your Voting Power </h3>
<p>Every person who contributes $10 gets to vote for the cause(s) they want the money to go to. </p>
<p>With every additional $10 you contribute, you will increase your voting power by 1.  For example, if you contribute $100 you will get to vote once, but your vote will be multiplied by 10, and the cause(s) you have selected will then benefit accordingly, because when all of the votes are calculated, only the 5 causes with the most votes will receive money.  </p>
<p>So, if one of the causes are of special importance to you, please consider the value of your contribution, and reach out to family and friends to get involved, because you have ""voting power"" to determine the outcome.  </p>

<h3><b>How This Campaign Will Help Us and Others</b></h3>
<div>
<p>We continue to receive strong interest from industry leaders, advertisers and large affinity groups and organizations across North America, many of them ready  to start their own iHives.  In order to meet this growing demand and expectations for <i>ihiveLIVE</i> we need to ensure that our technology and platform are leading-edge, which requires us to build a more agile, robust platform with mobile and wearable devices in mind.  The funds we raise through crowdfunding will help us accomplish this, and to create and ""go live"" with several iHives by the beginning of 2016. </p>
<p></p>

<p><i>ihiveLIVE</i>  is based on the basic principles of a beehive
whereby all participants contribute to building it and benefiting from the
activity, as bees do in building their hives. iHive portrays the way an individual will work within a group like bees in a hive, living and working together for a common goal, within a distinct community.
With <i>ihiveLIVE</i>  the individual iHives are the various groups of people to whom
the idea has some specific interest or relevance – “affinity” – and the
foundation for a community. As advertisers use the<i> ihiveLIVE  </i>platform to
support their business, the social commerce aspect grows, and revenue is
generated for everyone to share.</p>
<p>As members accumulate financial rewards they will have an
option to redirect their funds to their preferred causes. The <i>ihiveLIVE  </i>revenue sharing model
provides clear leadership in philanthropy and exemplifies the importance
of  “giving back” to your community. <b>We
are a social network with a “heart”</b>.</p>

</div></div>","ihiveLIVE 2.0 - Work-in-progress  
At ihiveLIVE we’re creating a new social media platform that enables you to turn your online activity into funds for those people and causes that are most important to you. We do this in the following manner: 1.) Upon sign up you provide us with two types of information      
     a.) What products you regularly buy and want to receive advertising for, and;              b.) What are the causes you want to support. 






2.) We will then connect you with online, discussion-based communities where you can discuss those topics you are most passionate about.  Communities such as: 


University Student Bodies and Sororities/Fraternities
Cycling, Running, or other Sporting Organizations
Movie or Book Discussion Groups
Local Charitable and Faith-based Organizations


                                   
3.) Based upon the advertising revenue that is generated by your online activity  in our communities ( from the tailor-based ads that you receive), we will automatically share 20% of your revenue to the causes that you support and 20% directly to you, the user. Although the funds will initially be small, as a large collective of users come together, we can generate revenue that will have a huge social impact for those causes that each of us care about.






In a world where everyone wants to share and help others, but not everyone has the financial means or the time to spare, ihiveLIVE plays an important role.  We know that social media can become a powerful tool for social good by simply sharing revenue with users and those causes they believe in. And we believe there are millions of people, just like you, who share our view. 
Join our movement and help us make it happen!






ihiveLIVE 2.0 - Work-in-progress 





The Evolution of Social Media 


Our Perks Reflect ""The Power of Revenue Sharing""

Our campaign perks reflect what we are all about --- ""the power of sharing"".  In recognition of your financial support we will take 10% of every dollar that you contribute and share it with five worthy charitable organizations that our supporters choose through a voting process. 
After you make a contribution you will receive an email with a link to a page with a list of cause related organizations, from which you will vote for those organizations (as many as you’d like) that you would like to see ihiveLIVE support with a percentage of the funds that are raised. At the conclusion of our campaign, we will redirect 10% of all funds to the 5 organizations with the most votes received. 
After you contribute you will receive an email from us providing a list of charitable organizations to support (you can add organizations as well) There may be a short delay in receiving our email that allows you to vote. If so, please know we appreciate your patience greatly!
Your Voting Power 
Every person who contributes $10 gets to vote for the cause(s) they want the money to go to. 
With every additional $10 you contribute, you will increase your voting power by 1.  For example, if you contribute $100 you will get to vote once, but your vote will be multiplied by 10, and the cause(s) you have selected will then benefit accordingly, because when all of the votes are calculated, only the 5 causes with the most votes will receive money.  
So, if one of the causes are of special importance to you, please consider the value of your contribution, and reach out to family and friends to get involved, because you have ""voting power"" to determine the outcome.  




How This Campaign Will Help Us and Others

We continue to receive strong interest from industry leaders, advertisers and large affinity groups and organizations across North America, many of them ready  to start their own iHives.  In order to meet this growing demand and expectations for ihiveLIVE we need to ensure that our technology and platform are leading-edge, which requires us to build a more agile, robust platform with mobile and wearable devices in mind.  The funds we raise through crowdfunding will help us accomplish this, and to create and ""go live"" with several iHives by the beginning of 2016. 


How You Can Help Us:

 - Please consider contributing to our campaign; remember, a percentage of the money you give will also be used to support a number of worthy causes
-  Become an advocate for ihiveLIVE, telling your friends and relatives about what we are doing and letting them know about our crowdfunding campaign
- Share our campaign on social media using the buttons provided at the top of our campaign page, just to the left of our crowdfunding video. 
- Use the Indiegogo ""referral button"" located at the top left side of this campaign page to help spread the word about ihiveLIVE through social media
- Become a volunteer, and a part of our team, and help us get mobilized quicker. Contact us at contact@ihivelive.com

I have decided not to HYPE or MANIPULATE the Campaign whatsoever. I detest these 2 words. The Campaign is an honorable one and will have to find itself in all the Crowdfunding noise out there or not. This 5 second attention span nonsense brought on by Social Media will not be engaged. The BABISA CARES Campaign is going to be Old School &amp; it is not a gimmick - we are dealing with human beings here that are suffering. It's is a values based Campaign whereby we CARE for our fellow Citizens and want to help them to achieve a better life. This is a REAL Campaign whereby we extend a helping hand to lift people up again. I can easily post horrific pictures of the squalor South Africans are faced with every day in Squatter Camps, to evoke EMOTION from the visitors but I won't out of respect to the poor.

The Campaign is an honorable one and will have to find itself in all the Crowdfunding noise out there or not. This 5 second attention span nonsense brought on by Social Media will not be engaged. The BABISA CARES Campaign is going to be Old School & it is not a gimmick - we are dealing with human beings here that are suffering. It's is a values based Campaign whereby we CARE for our fellow Citizens and want to help them to achieve a better life. This is a REAL Campaign whereby we extend a helping hand to lift people up again. I can easily post horrific pictures of the squalor South Africans are faced with every day in Squatter Camps, to evoke EMOTION from the visitors but I won't out of respect to the poor. Further...  I am having an obvious GEO-LOCATION issue here as the Campaign is not being picked up in the American or United Kingdom markets which is real bothersome, questionable & statistically IMPOSSIBLE.

</div></div>","COPR Security InnovationsWhen thinking of security companies, we don’t tend to think of social change. Instead, we picture corporate behemoths that are solely focused on profit.  We at COPR Security are committed to changing that.As the world’s first cause driven security company, we are on a mission to secure our nation’s most blighted neighborhoods, and do so by building a sustainable, cause-driven business model.For us, that starts by offering the most innovative tech for home security and automation......and if you're a residential real estate investor, you know how frustrating dealing with vacant properties can be.  Theft. Vandalism. Squatters. Water Damage. The appliances you put in yesterday just 'walking away'. Good News: We understand what you're going through and we designed something JUST FOR YOU! Introducing the VP Smart Tower, a DIY security tower that can be easily dropped in any vacant property you're hoping to secure.  It will report directly to your smartphone and can even be battery operated! You can also upgrade your VP Smart Tower by adding components that will communicate with the tower and offer you additional features such as:
Ability to open garage doors from your smartphone
Smart deadbolt locks on your doors
Additional motion/door break sensors.
Here are the full specs:                         Fighting Blight Across America...
We've spent the past 18 months developing our unique system. After thousands of conversations with frustrated residential real estate investors we've developed a system specifically for those who need to easily secure and monitor vacant properties in their portfolio.

The challenge for these non-profits is that they simply don't have the budget to afford these systems.  In partnership with community non-profits, like Habitat for Humanity Detroit and Manheim Park in Kansas City, we are combatting blight by donating systems and developing strategies to secure the vacant homes that drive it.           When a community starts experiencing high levels of vacant homes, it drives property values down, longtime residents out, and criminal activity in.  The VP SmartTower is a system unlike anything else on the market, designed to make it easy for investors and community development organizations to protect and monitor vacant properties.Where Will The Funds Go? 
The
money we raise will be used to help us fulfill our vision of being the world's first socially conscious security company, which includes:
Tooling and manufacturing of the VP SmartTower
Reducing our costs through large order quantities
Funding security systems and monitoring services for non-profit community development organizations

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>The
CANNAROMA CANNAISSEUR COLLECTION (CCC) MARIJUANA SENSORY TRAINING KIT is the
world’s first all-inclusive kit designed to educate everyone – experienced or
not – on the flavors and aromas found within the vast array of cannabis strains
available today. And since the kit contains NO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES, you can
educate yourself LEGALLY, regardless of whether you live in an area on the
cutting edge of the cannabis revolution or some place lagging a bit behind.  Awaken your senses today so you are able to identify the various compounds that make up the flavor and fragrance of cannabis while understanding which are responsible for the similarities and differences amongst your favorite strains.</p>
<p>Interest
in marijuana is booming. Four states and the District of Columbia have legalized
recreational, adult-use cannabis in the United States. Twenty-three permit use
for medical reasons. New states are voting on the issue every election cycle. And
entire countries, such as Canada, are pursuing nationwide cannabis
legalization.  </p>
<p>Gone
are the days when marijuana users accept anything in a baggie.   Now people
want to explore the nuanced flavors and aromas of different strains of
cannabis. Like fine wine, cannabis has terroir, and many of the things done by
a cultivator can be tasted in the final product.  Whether you’re an
experienced budtender or simply intrigued by this growing movement, don’t be
left out of everything marijuana has to offer! Learn how to appreciate cannabis
the same way you enjoy your favorite wine or beer!</p>

And
speaking of not missing out, the first 500 Cannaroma Cannaisseur Collections
have already completed production and ARE READY TO SHIP – a perfectly-scented
companion to any holiday season!<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What You Get</h3> <p>

<h3>What You Will Learn</h3> </div><div><ul>
<li>Identify the compounds that make-up the flavor and fragrance of cannabis<a href=""https://cannaroma.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
</li>
<li>Understand the language used to describe flavors and fragrances while creating your own, individualize linguistic palette</li>
<li>Use this knowledge to accurately describe the flavor/fragrance of cannabis strains and other botanicals<br/>
</li>
<li><span>Help you create a sensory understanding of the similarities and differences of different strains and perhaps map those to different physiological effects</span></li>
</ul></div> <div> <h3>Going Deeper</h3> <p></p>
<p>The
Cannaroma Team has been analyzing cannabis strains for over five years and is
composed of a collection of Ph.D. and Master’s chemists with experience that
extends back decades into the Dutch medical cannabis system.  Sure, we could have spent our time designing
new pharmaceuticals or developing food additives, but instead we focused on
what we loved to do—analyzing cannabis. 
And now we get to share our hard won knowledge and understanding with
the world.  Bettering one’s self never
tasted, felt, and smelt so good!</p>
<p>In
the process of determining what makes each strain unique, we have begun to
understand what aroma and flavor components are critical for flavor recognition
and training.  That’s why this collection
of aroma and flavor compounds is balanced between monoterpenes and
sesquiterpenes as well as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449979163/dnpkd9pystn9538y03mo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                       <b>The Cannaroma Lab</b>
</div><div>
<b><br/></b>
<p>The
physical properties of each compound impacts whether you detect its scent
quickly or it blooms slowly.  Whether the
taste lingers or is ephemeral like a flitting tongue-butterfly.  High, sharp notes and low, smooth notes.  Often these properties are common among
subclasses of compounds.  In
drug-discovery research, scientists often discuss structure-activity
relationships (SAR).  This is a way of connecting
the physical structure of molecules with the effects those compounds produce on
the body.  Now the next time your Big
Pharma friend is talking about SAR, you can say “yea, I know what that tastes
like” and she will be so surprised she won’t know what to say!  </p>
<p>Nowadays,
marijuana has far more potential than just getting you stoned. And although we always
have problems pronouncing ""sommelier"" ourselves, we know there is a
budding number of aspiring cannabis experts interested in anointing themselves
as “Cannaisseurs.”  At the same time,
there are those that do not have access to cannabis that want to know what the
fuss is all about. Whatever your inspiration, this is your chance to train your
nose to pick out individual compounds produced by the cannabis plant and to
recognize them in your favorite strain. 
Or to sniff out what’s in that stuff of unknown provenance that your
neighbor brings to your next dinner party.  </p>
<p>In
supporting this project, you will not only be supporting the creation of the
first ever cannabis sensory training and education program, but you will also be
helping to advance our mission at Cannaroma to understand the physiological
effects that the terpenes found in cannabis possess.  We plan to get to
the bottom of the so-called ""Entourage Effects.""  The better we understand Entourage Effects
the better humans will be able to unlock the medical promise of cannabis.  All of this same understanding can be further
distilled into larger and more diverse sensory training kits.  And in the process, if we attract other
like-minded individuals to the Cannaroma Entourage, we'll be pleased to share
the joy of appreciating! </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Since
the Cannaroma Cannaisseur Collection is already through the manufacturing
stage, the greatest challenges have already been tackled: choosing which
terpenes to include and how to present them. In the future, we hope to utilize
customer feedback and increased research to refine and expand these offerings.</p>

Additionally, although acceptance of marijuana is increasing, we realize that we may face some
resistance from those who are still uncomfortable with the legality of the
subject. That’s why we have taken every step to ensure that the Cannaisseur
Collection contains NO ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES and is LEGAL THROUGHOUT THE UNITED
STATES.<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>

The purpose of the CCC is
to help you test, train and refine your cannabis palate! By studying the
individual terpenes first-hand, you’ll expand your awareness and appreciation
of cannabis and the wonderfully wide world of terpenes.<br/></p><p>The CCC will also help you recognize both the similarities and differences between strains and help you learn how to describe fragrances and flavors using both existing scientific terminology and language you help create.</p><p><b>6.

or keeping it low-key with a group of close friends, smell a vial or taste a cartridge
and, without peeking, try to visualize what plants or foods you would find the
terpene in.  Then check your guesses

The
CANNAROMA CANNAISSEUR COLLECTION (CCC) MARIJUANA SENSORY TRAINING KIT is the
world’s first all-inclusive kit designed to educate everyone – experienced or
not – on the flavors and aromas found within the vast array of cannabis strains
available today. And since the kit contains NO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES, you can
educate yourself LEGALLY, regardless of whether you live in an area on the
cutting edge of the cannabis revolution or some place lagging a bit behind.  Awaken your senses today so you are able to identify the various compounds that make up the flavor and fragrance of cannabis while understanding which are responsible for the similarities and differences amongst your favorite strains.
Interest
in marijuana is booming. Four states and the District of Columbia have legalized
recreational, adult-use cannabis in the United States. Twenty-three permit use
for medical reasons. New states are voting on the issue every election cycle. And
entire countries, such as Canada, are pursuing nationwide cannabis
legalization.  
Gone
are the days when marijuana users accept anything in a baggie.   Now people
want to explore the nuanced flavors and aromas of different strains of
cannabis. Like fine wine, cannabis has terroir, and many of the things done by
a cultivator can be tasted in the final product.  Whether you’re an
experienced budtender or simply intrigued by this growing movement, don’t be
left out of everything marijuana has to offer! Learn how to appreciate cannabis
the same way you enjoy your favorite wine or beer!

And
speaking of not missing out, the first 500 Cannaroma Cannaisseur Collections
have already completed production and ARE READY TO SHIP – a perfectly-scented
companion to any holiday season!   What You Get 



Each
individual kit comes prepackaged with everything you need to educate yourself
and others on all of the often overlooked but exciting subtleties inherent in
the cannabis experience:


10 Liquid Smell Vials – in emerald green glass
50 Specially-Designed Smell Strips – for optimal aroma evaluation

10 Vapor Taste Cartridges – 9 individual terpenes and 1 strain blend
1 Rechargeable “510” Battery and USB Charging Connector – compatible with many other types of cartridges, if you so choose

9 Instructional Cannabis Terpene-Botanical Photo Cards

The Cannaisseur Companion – your guide to what’s in the box and beyond



Each
CCC is intended for repeated usage – as many as 100+ times! Break out the
Cannaroma Cannaisseur Collection at your next dinner party or while playing
board games with your friends.  You can
even host your own cannabis meducation event. You’ll be able to surround
yourself with fellow Cannaisseurs in no time!


What You Will Learn 
Identify the compounds that make-up the flavor and fragrance of cannabis

Understand the language used to describe flavors and fragrances while creating your own, individualize linguistic palette
Use this knowledge to accurately describe the flavor/fragrance of cannabis strains and other botanicals

Help you create a sensory understanding of the similarities and differences of different strains and perhaps map those to different physiological effects
  Going Deeper 
The
Cannaroma Team has been analyzing cannabis strains for over five years and is
composed of a collection of Ph.D. and Master’s chemists with experience that
extends back decades into the Dutch medical cannabis system.  Sure, we could have spent our time designing
new pharmaceuticals or developing food additives, but instead we focused on
what we loved to do—analyzing cannabis. 
And now we get to share our hard won knowledge and understanding with
the world.  Bettering one’s self never
tasted, felt, and smelt so good!
In
the process of determining what makes each strain unique, we have begun to
understand what aroma and flavor components are critical for flavor recognition
and training.  That’s why this collection
of aroma and flavor compounds is balanced between monoterpenes and
sesquiterpenes as well as monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids.  

                                                       The Cannaroma Lab


The
physical properties of each compound impacts whether you detect its scent
quickly or it blooms slowly.  Whether the
taste lingers or is ephemeral like a flitting tongue-butterfly.  High, sharp notes and low, smooth notes.  Often these properties are common among
subclasses of compounds.  In
drug-discovery research, scientists often discuss structure-activity
relationships (SAR).  This is a way of connecting
the physical structure of molecules with the effects those compounds produce on
the body.  Now the next time your Big
Pharma friend is talking about SAR, you can say “yea, I know what that tastes
like” and she will be so surprised she won’t know what to say!  
Nowadays,
marijuana has far more potential than just getting you stoned. And although we always
have problems pronouncing ""sommelier"" ourselves, we know there is a
budding number of aspiring cannabis experts interested in anointing themselves
as “Cannaisseurs.”  At the same time,
there are those that do not have access to cannabis that want to know what the
fuss is all about. Whatever your inspiration, this is your chance to train your
nose to pick out individual compounds produced by the cannabis plant and to
recognize them in your favorite strain. 
Or to sniff out what’s in that stuff of unknown provenance that your
neighbor brings to your next dinner party.  
In
supporting this project, you will not only be supporting the creation of the
first ever cannabis sensory training and education program, but you will also be
helping to advance our mission at Cannaroma to understand the physiological
effects that the terpenes found in cannabis possess.  We plan to get to
the bottom of the so-called ""Entourage Effects.""  The better we understand Entourage Effects
the better humans will be able to unlock the medical promise of cannabis.  All of this same understanding can be further
distilled into larger and more diverse sensory training kits.  And in the process, if we attract other
like-minded individuals to the Cannaroma Entourage, we'll be pleased to share
the joy of appreciating!    Risks & Challenges 

Since
the Cannaroma Cannaisseur Collection is already through the manufacturing
stage, the greatest challenges have already been tackled: choosing which
terpenes to include and how to present them. In the future, we hope to utilize
customer feedback and increased research to refine and expand these offerings.

Additionally, although acceptance of marijuana is increasing, we realize that we may face some
resistance from those who are still uncomfortable with the legality of the
subject. That’s why we have taken every step to ensure that the Cannaisseur
Collection contains NO ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES and is LEGAL THROUGHOUT THE UNITED
STATES.    Other Ways You Can Help

<p><b>Our
Story:</b></p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to
read about my crowdfund campaign! My name is Colette. I am a mother and an
entrepreneur who enjoys helping others and working towards the greater good. As
someone who grew up with limited means, I understand more than most what it
feels like to struggle to take care of your family, put food on the table, and
provide for their basic needs. I know there are people out there who just need
that one chance, just one small break, to get them back on their feet, and
perhaps help others at the same time. </p>
<p>My new website (cocodeau.com) provides a
place to purchase meaningful, original, and unusual items, perfect for as a
gift for friends and family. I purposely seek out items to sell from local
communities, and individuals who are in need of a little extra financial
support in exchange for their goods and services. I strongly believe that
putting money and time into local communities who are struggling, and in this
way giving people a way to earn money for their families, helps bring people
out of poverty and pull communities back together. </p>
<p><b>Our First Project -- Ghana:</b></p>
<p>Our
first project will be to connect with a community in Ghana, which is located on
the coast of West Africa, and work with them to sell arts, crafts, and other
handmade items made by individuals in the community. Living in an area where a
large population of children are in desperate need of care, we know there are
many who are abandoned by their families for the simple fact that they can no
longer afford to feed them. Those families who are still managing to stay
together are struggling, and looking to find a way to make ends meet in a
stalled economy. </p>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>Our
ultimate goal, and the reason we have created this crowdfund campaign project
is to raise the money to be able to purchase a facility in their area to create
a community center for the people in this community. We want to provide for
them a safe, well-lit, clean area where they can ply their trades as steady
employment, while also providing their families educational and medical
resources that are sorely lacking in this area. 
</p>
<p>On
the other side of the world, this project would also provide employment to
people locally in North America, as we would need to hire salespeople,
warehouse workers, and more, providing more opportunities to earn a stable income
in our own communities back home, in Alberta Canada, with the option to expand
as our business grows over the course of the next year. </p>
<p>We
are also in the process of talking with First Nation’s communities as well as
others locally in Canada, to help their already established community centers
add ways for their people to earn an income while providing us with unique,
handmade goods that can be sold on our website. </p>
<p><b>What
We Need:</b></p>
<p>Before we can help the people of Ghana, we
first need to bolster our business here in Canada. The funding will be used for
the following:</p>
<p>●<span>  </span>longterm lease or
purchase of a warehouse location in Alberta, Canda</p>
<p>●<span>  </span>purchase of space and
basic equipment for the first project facility in Ghana, in the Volta Region</p>
<p>●<span>  </span> hiring of staff, enabling some of the people
to start earning a decent wage right away</p>
<p>●<span>  </span>marketing costs</p>

""There is no doubt that our current living patterns are unsustainable, or that we must find new ways of supporting ourselves which place a lighter load on our enviroment. As individuals we are responsible for our own actions and are free to make informed choices about how we live. Faced with an uncertain future it is tempting to turn a blind eye and hope things will somehow ""turn it alright"". If there was ever a time for positive action, it is surely now. The question is: Do you want to be part of the problem, or part of the solution?""

from The Earth Care Manual - Patrick Whitefield



Cascina Ghila is a place where people can come and try living a different kind of life and a new kind of community.
It is on two hectare piece of land in the Alps in the north-west of Italy which I bought in December 2014 and where I have been living live since March 2016.
With this campaign, my main goals are to get enough funding to start the first projects on the land and to prepare the guestrooms. So, among the many perks there is the possibility to be hosted here for a while in order to learn more about permaculture and this sustainable way of life.

Why PermaculturePermaculture is a framework for creating sustainable ways of living, a method for developing ecological, efficient and productive systems that can be used by anyone, anywhere.
Main projects
 
There are a lot of projects going on, all based on permaculture principles, including:  An orchard of 150 fruit trees
A vegetable garden
Two greenhouses
Compost toilet and solar showers
Two water tanks
A chicken coop

A retired engineer, in love with nature and fed up with the busy life of the city, I decided to look for a way to live my life differently.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you can imagine the app being free does not mean it's without costs. We have vested interest in its success going forward - not only for personal reasons anymore, but for all the people that can benefit from it as you can see from the testimonials.</p>
<p>You can already get the app if you have an iOS8+ device and we plan to maintain it. What we'll provide additionally are new suitable features, improved UI experience, but mainly we'd like to add more platforms (Android, Windows, Web) and more languages + maybe some additional themes including accessibility options. We also need to do a bit of marketing to spread the word some more esp. where needed.</p>
<p>So that is where we are counting on your support - the more funding we can obtain, the greater the impact can become!</p>

<div>As hard as it may seem to believe the largest publicly traded oil and gas company on the planet is concerned that an ignorant public might harm themselves by accidentally consuming ExxonMobil gas instead of Roxx Vodka solely because of the ""XXs"". In addition this behemoth of more than 83,000 employees with countless billions of dollars is afraid that a start up company of two people selling a new ultra premium Polish vodka in two states will somehow dilute their trademark and cause them ""irreparable harm."" Given events of the past and the apparent prevailing opinion held by the public regarding Exxon this would be a hysterical position for them to take if in doing so they weren't trying to harm a small business.</div>
<div>Roxx Vodka is the first product offered by Phoenix based Nielsen Spirits, Inc. founded by Angela Nielsen and her partner Bill Ferguson of Los Angeles. Roxx is one of, if not the only ultra-premium vodka created by blending 4 grains (rye, wheat, barley and triticale), Although only being launched about a year ago it has already found a loyal and growing following in Phoenix and Los Angeles. Nielsen's mission statement is to create a responsible company that hopes to provide quality products and position themselves to give back to their community.</div>
<div>After filing for a trademark Nielsen was contacted in September of 2013 by Exxon's counsel claiming that the proposed Roxx logo infringed on the Exxon logo. After more than a year of going back and forth and offering alternative designs that were each rejected by Exxon as still giving an ""inference of and impression of a likelihood of confusion"" Exxon initiated an action with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. During this time Exxon was also actively involved in litigation with Fox Entertainment over their new network Foxx. That matter was settled confidentially on the eve of trial and there doesn't appear any significant change in the Fox logo. Fox, being a reasonable and fair minded company entered into a mutual consent agreement with Nielsen so that neither would ever treat the other the way that Exxon has and is treating them both.</div>
<div>Realizing that litigation was eminent, Nielsen's partner, an attorney in CA requested that any litigation please be filed in either AZ or CA since those are the only two states where Roxx is presently sold. Exxon's response was to file a lawsuit in Federal Court in the Southern District of Florida in Miami citing a single event in which Roxx had provided some promotional bottles as their reason for selecting Miami. The real reason is Exxon hoped that a company of two people would not be able to respond and defend themselves thousands of miles away from home. Exxon could sue anyone anywhere and if their true motivation was solely to defend their mark against a legitimate infringement then they would have elected to have done so where Roxx could more easily respond.</div>
<div>In its complaint Exxon actually takes the position that because of the alleged similarity of the marks that the general public is at risk as the Roxx's mark presents a possible health risk. It is odd that anyone would keep gas behind a bar and it is certain that if any person connected with Exxon in any capacity was presented with two shot glasses, one containing 91 octane and the other Roxx Vodka that anyone would mistakenly drink the Exxon product.</div>
<div><b>CAMPAIGN GOALS</b></div>
<div>As a result of Exxon's filing of a lawsuit in Florida Nielsen needs to raise funds to defend itself against this giant. The goal is $50K which Nielsen Spirits conservatively hopes and believes will cover close to half of the anticipated fees and costs. How does David fight Goliath in 2015? David brings the village with him to the fight. That is what Nielsen is hoping to do with this campaign. Companies like Exxon shouldn't be able and allowed to trample on smaller companies simply because they can. While this is personal to Nielsen Spirits we see this as addressing a larger issue and hope that with the public's help we can send a message to big business that the days of being able to roll over anyone they want simply because of their size and not the merit of their position is over. If successful we know that this campaign will garner a tremendous amount of publicity and will serve to make companies like ExxonMobil think twice before picking on the next ""little guy.""</div>

Stema Women Development Group was a registered as a non-partisan and non-profit
making local women’s human rights community-based organization, with a focus on
gender equality and women’s empowerment not only as human rights, but also
because they are a pathway to achieving the Millennium Development Goals and
sustainable development. The
organization was established in the year 2004 as a result of a workshop
organized by Feredaration of women lawyers- Kenya chapter (FIDA) that sought to
strengthen the networking capacities of women organizations and groups in
Kenya. At this particular workshop, violence against women was identified as a
serious women rights violation that needed concerted efforts to address. 






Mission:- To ensure that women have a real voice in all governance institutions, from the
judiciary to the civil service, as well as in the private sector and women
organizations/groups and movements, so they can participate equally with men in
public dialogue and decision-making and influence the decisions that will
determine the future of their families and communities.

 Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.
- The organization will use social impact entrepreneurship as a tool to sell condoms and other 
contraceptives and provide reproductive health and family planning 
services, through innovative marketing and distribution channels, 
including the Internet, social media sites, midwives, clinics, drug and 
grocery stores, and

- Because it will enable the organization to train the FGM escapees/girls on social entrepreneurship through a highly structured committed process designed to embed skills and motivate them to give sufficiently to the improvement of their lifestyles.
 Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.
- Will help us achieve the social entrepreneurship and information communication technologies in the community through  a highly structured committed process designed to embed skills and 
motivate them to give sufficiently to the improvement of their 
lifestyles and that of the extended communities.
  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?
- Yes.   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you. 
1. The much funding we need as an organization is $ 4,950,000,
2. This amount of money/funding will go to:-
a). Project designing/developing/planning = $ 25,000
b). Procurement of the I. E. C. Materials = 1,200,000,
c). Implementation = $ 2,800,000,
d). Monitoring and Evaluation = $ 400,000,
e). Documentation = $ 50,000,
f). Report Writing and subsequent submission to the donors = $ 15,000, and

g). 10% Constituencies = $ 450,000.
 
 Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!
- We would like them to know that once we shall be through with the project, we shall give/send over to them project training materials such as:- 1. T-Shirt conveying the project messages, 2. Training Cap, 3. Still Pictures, 4. DVDs, 5. a report on the same.
 
 Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.

The funds will go to the training of the FGM Escapees/Girls on social entrepreneurship through a highly structured commitment process designed to embed skills and motivate them to give sufficiently to the improvement of their lifestyles.
    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.
It will be valuable because, it will re-look at the cultural stereotypes of intelligence in men and women, showing the gender inequality in self-presentation and rate their technological skills in activities
 such as basic computer functions and online participatory communication
 which is lower than their male counterpart, which will improve on their high education levels and social integration significantly in the 
productivity of all members of the household and improve equity 
throughout society. 

 Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).
For
the last 11 (Eleven) years, Stema Women Development Group has focused on the maxim
of coordinating grassroots efforts to integrate gender equality and women’s
empowerment into poverty reduction, democratic governance, crisis prevention
and recovery, and environment and sustainable development through its local
network that works to ensure that women have a real voice in all governance
institutions, from the judiciary to the civil service, as well as in the
private sector and women organizations/groups and movements, so they can
participate equally with men in public dialogue and decision-making and influence
the decisions that will determine the future of their families and communities. 

 Make it real for people and build trust.
- It is very real and can attest to, if asked to.
    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.
The common obstacles we anticipate of may be:-
- 1. Getting or looking for too much information,
2. Having no clear action plan,
3. Shortage of time, money, or other resources,
4. Having Mindset and attitude, and
5. Lack of support or guidance.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.
- Picking on one project to study and go with that model,
need to have a clear action plan right from the beginning to the end without applying any guesswork ideology/methodology, 

before setting out on our goal, we shall figure out the amount of time we will 
need to put into this, the costs we will incur, and the resources we 
will need to obtain and use,
adopting the mindset of success by thinking and speaking positively and adopting 
the attitude of success by seeing obstacles as opportunities and 
setbacks as feedback, and

finding a mentor, coach, teacher, friend, joint venture partner, anyone who
 will hold your hand, guide you, support you until you reach your goal. 
 Describe your plan for solving these challenges.
By recognizing and overcoming the common pitfalls associated with growth/success is
 essential if our business/project is to continue to grow and thrive. 
Crucially, we shall need to ensure that the steps we take today don't 
themselves create additional problems for the future, thus effective 
leadership will help us make the most of the opportunities, creating 
sustainable growth for the future of the project. (In a nutshell, we shall keep up with the market, planning ahead, cash flow and financial management, problem solving, the right systems, skills and attitudes and welcoming change).

    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
We humbly make our passionate appeal to our online friends to not necessarily make/help/donate funding, but also to make much noise to those who might not be knowledgeable of this campaign to do something towards this noble project that is meant to help out the Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Escapees make a meaningful lifestyles.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Red Top Technology is focused on bringing the best of technology to underserved markets.</p>
<p>My name is Rick Stump and I am co-founder of Red Top Technology. I grew up in rural America, in Amish country, and saw first-hand how lack of access impedes opportunity. Lack of public transportation; lack of capital; lack of access to technology. These are leading reasons for the fact that the majority of people in America who live in poverty are rural.</p>
<p>After 20+ years in high tech I noticed that many mainstream technology providers largely ignore rural opportunities. There are a number of reasons for this, most benign, but the result is the same - lucrative markets are underserved. This lessens opportunity and impedes growth in these areas, continuing the cycle that creates poverty.</p>
<p>Red Top Technology is focused on being a provider of cutting-edge technology solutions at a competitive price and making sure that the underserved rural markets of Georgia and Alabama have access to those same solutions and prices. This will allow everyone from small businesses to local schools grow and thrive.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What the money will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential infrastructure- the tools we need to reach customers and sell</li>
<li>Operating capital - keeping the lights on while we start the process</li>
<li>Marketing - letting these rural areas know that they have a solution</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not reach our full target? We continue on with what he have! the goal of $60,000 is our good-faith estimate of what we will need to be successful in 90 days - less than that just pushes back the date we become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>What you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you make sure we have your contact info, when we are profitable you get your money back. After the first quarter of profitability, we will start paying back everyone who gave to us through this campaign until you get 110% of what you donated to us</li>
<li>Once all donors are repaid we will also donate 10% of total raised funds to charity in the name of our donors</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here is an example of how access to a value-added reseller can drive growth. </p>
<p>A man in a town of 2,000 people who is remote from a large metro area may be forced to rely on local retail outlets or online ordering for equipment like laptops and desktops. He will have to spend a great deal of time researching what hardware and software he needs, and might be forced to pay large fees to a company to install the equipment for him. These contribute to the average cost to start a small business in rural areas being $32,000.</p>
<p>  At Red Top Technology we don't just offer lower prices on hardware and software, our staff provides free assistance with identifying solutions and has discounted or free prices on installation and configuration, saving that business owner not just 10%-25% on infrastructure costs but also a great deal of time. Those savings continue year after year as we partner with them to maintain and grow their infrastructure. We can also make them aware of alternative technologies that can give them a competitive advantage or solve problems.</p>
<p>These same benefits extend to rural school districts, town governments, and more. The impact of this would be like adding 3%-5% more money to those schools' and towns' budgets while giving the students access to leading education solutions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Many rural communities are simply unaware of what a value-added reseller is and what they can do. Marketing and education will be key to raising local awareness.</p>
<p>Our staff will have to be fully engaged and well trained.</p>
<p>We have to make sure that larger, urban clients do not demand the majority of our focus.</p>
<p>We are confident we can overcome this issues because of our tight focus, strong background, and dedication. We are a rural firm ourself, founded in Appalachia, and our own background and location will keep us close to the communities we serve.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This campaign was created to raise funds to own and live on land. As children, we grew up in the mountains and remember how great it was to hike in our own back yard, eat from our own garden, and share stories and laughter around the wood burning stove on cold winter nights.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk and challenges that come along with meeting this goal are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before any improvements can be done to the land, we need to own it free and clear so that we'll be listed as the owner and are thus free to do improvement on it.</li>
<li>The septic system has to be installed and floor plans approved before we can get a building permit which will allow us to have a temporary residence on the land while we are building our home. So until then, we wont be able to live on the property.</li>
</ul>
<p>The modular house we are planning to built is in its simplest design and can be constructed in only a couple of weeks. We are not planning anything elaborate. We are also persistent and determined and tracking every dime to make this a reality.</p>

<p>I was a creative and craft (in a good sense) child; always drawing, making music, tinkering, making/breaking/putting things back together again. As the years passed, climbing the professional ladder and paying bills left less and less room from doing things that fed my creative self. However, during the last few years, I've been on an active path of seeking to find an outlet for my creativity.</p>
<p>Always in search of the

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Baltimore is the site of a burgeoning makers, artisan and small business owners community.  Realizing my dream of becoming a maker of handmade goods and starting my own small business has been a surreal and wonderful experience.  I have seen glimpses of where this business can go and I have already reached the point of needing occasional part-time assistance with filling occasional wholesale orders.  As I move into this next phase of hiring part-time help, I will intentionally provide jobs for undeserved and marginalized populations including transgender persons and women impacted by domestic violence.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every new business has its risks and challenges but production won't be an issue. I have learned through repeated testing and production of these candles how much time and materials are required to fulfill orders. Fulfillment will begin shortly after the project is funded. I have already sourced and allocated the raw materials necessary to fulfill each order.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>I understand that it may not be possible for you to financially support, but please take some time to spread the word about this campaign! Social media and word-of-mouth is the key!

</div></div>","Backstory 
I was a creative and craft (in a good sense) child; always drawing, making music, tinkering, making/breaking/putting things back together again. As the years passed, climbing the professional ladder and paying bills left less and less room from doing things that fed my creative self. However, during the last few years, I've been on an active path of seeking to find an outlet for my creativity.
Always in search of the
perfect candle, one day while putzing through a home décor store, I stumbled
across a candle that was wonderfully scented in a simple and beautiful jar.  In that instant, I had an undeniable moment of
inspiration and thought to myself, ""you can make a candle like this.""   I immediately went home and watched every candle making video I could find, experimented with the different waxes and fragrances for about 4 months and purchased
a bunch of candle supplies. In choosing the fragrances, I drew inspiration from the many places around the world where I'd lived or
traveled. 
I passed the candles along to friends and family for months and received overwhelmingly positive feedback. I quickly designed the logo, the website, the packaging and finalized the six fragrance profiles currently in the line. Word quickly spread and I found myself fielding orders from people I didn't even know who had received the candles as gifts.

The Impact
Baltimore is the site of a burgeoning makers, artisan and small business owners community.  Realizing my dream of becoming a maker of handmade goods and starting my own small business has been a surreal and wonderful experience.  I have seen glimpses of where this business can go and I have already reached the point of needing occasional part-time assistance with filling occasional wholesale orders.  As I move into this next phase of hiring part-time help, I will intentionally provide jobs for undeserved and marginalized populations including transgender persons and women impacted by domestic violence.

Risks & Challenges
Every new business has its risks and challenges but production won't be an issue. I have learned through repeated testing and production of these candles how much time and materials are required to fulfill orders. Fulfillment will begin shortly after the project is funded.

<p>Our vision at Bar K is to create a unique, one-of-a-kind community meeting place for dogs, dog lovers and others in Kansas City.  We are planning to locate Bar K on two spectacular acres of undeveloped land on the western edge of Berkley Riverfront Park in downtown Kansas City, partially under the Heart of America Bridge.</p>

<p>Bar K will combine a two-acre, professionally maintained and fully staffed dog park, with a bar/restaurant/coffeehouse where customers can enjoy a drink or a healthy bite to eat.  The dog park will include the following:</p>
<p>•    Separate large and small dog play areas<br/>•    Supervision by trained Bar K staff at all times<br/>•    Dog recreational equipment<br/>•    All-weather seating areas with water, heaters, fans, shade, and shelter<br/>•    Dog washing stations</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Bar K's bar/restaurant/coffeehouse will be open to the public, but our customers will buy memberships for their dogs to access the park.  This will allow us to track usage of the park, make sure all the pups are appropriately socialized, vaccinated, etc., as well as to generate revenue to support all of the park features like all-weather seating, water stations, landscaping, etc.  We expect that an annual membership will be $149 for the first dog, $25 for each additional dog in the same household.  However, we are offering a discounted membership rate of $100 in this campaign in the ""featured"" perk.  Some of the other perks come with memberships as well.</p>
<p>Bar K's bar/restaurant/coffeehouse will be designed in a modern/industrial style using repurposed shipping containers, in keeping with the riverfront location.  We will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, serving great coffee, healthy food and craft beer, wine and cocktails in a casual, relaxed atmosphere.  We will have a large conference room available for private meetings and occasions.  We’ll also have an event calendar with regular educational speakers, music, a weekly 5K series, “breed nights” and other opportunities for pet lovers to get together.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>  My name is Monique and I am a licensed cosmetologist and owner of Monique Michelle the Studio located in Winston Salem, North Carolina. Since middle school, I have always loved helping people. I thought that one day I'd be a nurse, like my mother, but after several attempts in college, I changed my major to Special Education. After obtaining that degree, my sister convinced me to attend cosmetology school. I was excited but hesitant because I was discouraged by someone that told me that hairstylist don't make money and that basically I would fail. I pursued on into my dream. I knew exactly how I would play my cards. I would move to Atlanta, GA, get a job in the school system and then work part time as a hairstylist, building my clientele and then reversing my time to make my passion a full time service to others. My last semester in school changed everything and 6 months later I lost my unborn son but soon delivered his twin sister. What an adaptation. My plans changed but not too much. I worked full time in a daycare for 2 years, the last 6 months of that working part time for Regis Corporation. It was time. I told my boss if she moved me to full time, I'd quit my other job. I did just that. I worked as a hairstylist, was promoted to a Salon Manager while being there for 2 years. I grew the company. It was time for a change. I went and worked for JCPenney Salon for 3 1/2 years, only to be blessed even more there. I ranked as number 2 in the salon of 20+ stylist and in the top 5 for the whole district, receiving America's Best award twice and being promoted to master stylist. I worked hard, still do and last April, it was time again. I branched out and decided to booth rent at a salon. It was great. I have a great, diverse clientele and the sky was my limit. I planned on being there until I was tired of doing hair. That changed at the end of the summer, with little to no notice, we received information that our salon building would be sold and that when it was, we would have 90 to leave. I had to think fast. What was I to do? I searched everywhere looking for a location to house my clients. It had to be just right. It had to be the best. I found it but with little monies to fund it. I had to make a choice. I want to be stationary and in a great location. DOWNTOWN!!!  So I signed a lease for a space downtown. All I can think about is how am I going to do this, how will I be able to help people. I have to be able to do both! My own salon is where I will do it!</p>
<p>   This campaign is very important to me because I want to give the best to the best. For those that are less fortunate, I'm here for them too. My plans are to team up with a few local non profit organizations to help with work re-entry. I'm so excited! This is my dream come true. I never made it as a nurse but I'm still helping people be better in life in more ways than one.</p>
<p>   With donations from contributors I will be able to purchase initial equipment and supplies needed in the salon for setup, purchase and provide marketing materials, purchase signage, continuing education, purchase supplies for work re-entry recipients and other community service activities.</p>

<p>Perks to include: First 5 sponsors to contribute $100 or more will receive 50% off of a service.</p>
<p>                     Contributions of $20-$50 will receive a free eyebrow waxing with a service</p>

<p>                                                       $100 &amp; over will receive a free a free color accent with a service</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All the funds collected will be used for the better of the business and/or community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contributors are a big reason why I will be able to build a good fresh foundation to start my business. Considering I am located in the heart of downtown, there will be many that I will be able to help in the community. Free cut and styles for the children in the shelter, location for educational trainings. This business will also allow me to introduce a world of community service to my daughter who participates in our family community events of helping those that are less fortunate. She will be able to set up little projects in the building such as collecting food, school supplies, etc for those less fortunate. Every and any event that is planned, will always welcome our youth to participate, as their opportunity to give back to the community as well.</p>
<p>I know that this a risk of opening my own salon. I have faith that this is a great opportunity for myself and the community. There are times in which business can become slow: winter and summer. I have to plan accordingly and take advantage of that time by marketing and promoting myself. If these challenges do come up, I will have had emergency funds put aside and stay promoting my business. Nothing will be perfect but I'm going to make it as perfect as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know that everyone that reads my story won't be able to contribute but if you would walk in my shoes and pass this information on, that would be a huge help as well. Whether it's passing my information on to someone else or just saying a prayer that my business succeeds, that would be excellent in itself!</p>

In the comfort of your own home, you can release yourself from the pain that restricts your movements and limits your enjoyment of life.</p><p><strong>What is fascia?</strong></p><p>The fascia is the dense layer of connective tissue that separates and stabilizes the muscles throughout our body. When injured or inflamed, the fascia knots up causing intense pain and restricting our movements.</p><p>Because of its fibrous nature, the fascia needs time to soften in order for it to release. When you are in pain, the slightest movement triggers the fight or flight response of the sympathetic nervous system which intensifies your pain. So you seek a method or a tool that will help you end the pain cycle. However, if the treatment itself is too painful, you are not likely to use it often enough or long enough for it to be effective.</p><p>THERALIGN®'s small diameter and low clearance design allows you to use it in a comfortable position. You can fully relax as you locate your own trigger points or painful spots. Using time and your body weight, you can bring about a release. It's been said that it's finally a ""good pain"" when you find and release trigger points while on the THERALIGN® massage bar. You will be amazed at how quickly the THERALIGN® melts your trigger points and relieves your pain. Sometimes, you don't even realize how many trigger points you had until you use the THERALIGN® massage bar! </p><p><strong>How was THERALIGN® started?</strong></p><p>The THERALIGN® was co-invented by a physical therapist and an architect. Throughout 25 years of clinical experience, the therapist experienced dissatisfaction with the tools available in the market to give her clients' freedom from pain when they had no immediate access to treatment. The architect and the physical therapist collaborated in the design and production of a product that met the therapy needs and would be a durable and safe. Together, they have designed a self-massaging bar that's unique, effective and affordable.

In the comfort of your own home, you can release yourself from the pain that restricts your movements and limits your enjoyment of life.What is fascia?The fascia is the dense layer of connective tissue that separates and stabilizes the muscles throughout our body. When injured or inflamed, the fascia knots up causing intense pain and restricting our movements.Because of its fibrous nature, the fascia needs time to soften in order for it to release. When you are in pain, the slightest movement triggers the fight or flight response of the sympathetic nervous system which intensifies your pain. So you seek a method or a tool that will help you end the pain cycle. However, if the treatment itself is too painful, you are not likely to use it often enough or long enough for it to be effective.THERALIGN®'s small diameter and low clearance design allows you to use it in a comfortable position. You can fully relax as you locate your own trigger points or painful spots. Using time and your body weight, you can bring about a release. It's been said that it's finally a ""good pain"" when you find and release trigger points while on the THERALIGN® massage bar. You will be amazed at how quickly the THERALIGN® melts your trigger points and relieves your pain. Sometimes, you don't even realize how many trigger points you had until you use the THERALIGN® massage bar! How was THERALIGN® started?The THERALIGN® was co-invented by a physical therapist and an architect. Throughout 25 years of clinical experience, the therapist experienced dissatisfaction with the tools available in the market to give her clients' freedom from pain when they had no immediate access to treatment. The architect and the physical therapist collaborated in the design and production of a product that met the therapy needs and would be a durable and safe. Together, they have designed a self-massaging bar that's unique, effective and affordable. The THERALIGN® will pay for itself in one use.What is the goal?We believe that when you are experiencing pain, it limits your capacity to be productive, creative and joyful. Our mission is to have people experience wellness in their bodies. The goal of this campaign is to get the THERALIGN® massage bar to market, locally and then globally.With your help, we will be able to move forward with our patent process, create a website, buy additional materials to increase the number of THERALIGN® bars produced, as well as package, distribute and sell the product.We are currently creating the THERALIGN® bar on a small scale in a garage near Boulder, Colorado.

<p>Society is

people are asking the question 'is it wrong to date more than one'? The answer
is solely depends on your approach towards life. If you are honest with your
partner/s I think we can call multiple dating and polyamorous dating as
ethical. In line with this many polyamorous relationships are blooming in the
society. It is upto you to decide whether to choose monogamy or polyamory as
your relationship style. Polyamory is becoming prominent in the world, where
relationships are open and ethical between life partners. </p>

<p>This may be the
first time you are reading the term 'polyamory'. This lifestyle may not be
acceptable for everyone; as many people were not able to recognize LGBT rights
20 years ago. But polyamory was prevalent in history in the form of polygamy or
polygyny etc. In the modern day societies where open relationships are more,
polyamory is becoming an alternative way of life.</p>

</p><p>  Generations of war
veterans have been exposed to the prolific use of the helicopter in daily
military practice.  The Huey helicopter has long been a ubiquitous icon of
security and safe haven. Veterans returning from theaters of conflict have had
to silently contend with their war time experiences, once referred to as shell
shock, flash backs and most recently Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  We
believe that when Veterans again experience the sights and sounds of a Huey
helicopter, it will enable them to let their thoughts and memories unfurl in a
positive, cathartic and healing manner.</p>
<p>  Liberty Warbird
Association, a 501c (3) non-profit organization is working towards the
restoration of  66-16823, a Vietnam era UH-1H ""Huey""
helicopter.  Your financial contribution will be tax deductible.  Our
mission is multi-focused. First, the Association wants to provide combat
veterans contending with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with a link to their
past by offering therapeutic re-experience flights.  Second, to enlighten
and educate other veterans, pilots, and the general public about the unique and
historic role played in combat, by the Huey helicopter.  Lastly, we seek
to ensure the legacy of service by both the combat veteran and the aircraft and
crews that flew them is not forgotten. </p>
<p>  Liberty Warbird
Association is made up by volunteer ex - military helicopter mechanics, crew
chiefs, and pilots.  Many of the volunteers meet twice a week to work
together in a coordinated effort to ensure 823 is rigidly inspected
to United States Army Aviation formatted phased maintenance protocol.
 </p>
<p>  Huey 823 arrived
without main rotor blades.  In order to return to the skies, 823 will need
several issues corrected.  Time remaining main rotor blades will need to
be purchased or donated.  A set of 200 hour time remaining main rotor
blades has been located.  However they
will need to be purchased for $41,000.00.   The aircraft's left side fuel
bladder will need to be replaced with a new bladder. This item will cost close
to $9,000.00. An original T53-L-13A turbine engine tear down &amp; inspection
will be required to determine if merely an overhaul will be required to meet
FAA airworthiness Directives. 

Weather an overhaul or a replacement turbine is required the
Association is looking at a&amp; 200,000.00 cost.</p><p> Liberty Warbird Association is staffed with the mechanical and
aviation expertise to return this aircraft and keep it flying for the sake of
veterans for years to come. We need your help to help give back to those who
have sacrificed so much and continue to do so on a daily basis.

</div></div>","Covalent brings together awesome people to do awesome things. We host pitch events where diverse groups who might not typically interact are able to identify, form teams around, and work together to solve social problems.


Our goal is to help people build meaningful relationships, develop entrepreneurial skills, believe in themselves and in others, and use that belief to make a difference in their communities. Our process starts with our Pitch Event, then a $1K Challenge (four weeks to raise $1000), and then a Bootcamp run by our curriculum partner, PurposeFuel. 


Our First Pitch Event!



We held our first pitch event on September 10th, and it went better than we could have hoped! While other programs establish complicated barriers to entry like applications, scholastic backgrounds, and interviews, we decided to focus on the entrepreneurs and their passions. By removing these stipulations we helped people leap forward with their innovative solutions to hard-to-tackle issues. 

We've Got More To Do!
This was the first real test of our model. We were excited by the turnout, not just the number, but how different each of us was: 2/3 of those pitching were women, 2/3 were people of color and so far 2 teams have joined our $1K Challenge! 


In fact, we're going to do a $1K Challenge ourselves!!! So help us keep our momentum going and bring more budding entrepreneurs from your communities together! Maybe you even have an idea you'd like to get off the ground?
   What We Need & What You Get  We need $1000 to help continue to bring people together to tackle some of the communities most relevant issues of our time! 
If we don't reach our entire goal, the fund will go to bringing more people together for nights like our Pitch Event and Bootcamps! 




The first 5 people to donate $1000 will receive a massively-discounted spot in our Bootcamp, run by our curriculum partner, PurposeFuel. In this Bootcamp, you'll get:



8 collaborative workshop sessions


7 project assignments


1 private coaching




AND learn



How to move from idea to action
How to pitch your idea to funders
How to craft a strong mission and vision statement
How to articulate a logic model and theory of change
How to write a social venture business plan

   
The Impact
There's been a lot of talk in entrepreneurship and tech circles about increasing diversity. But one of the things we've found is that diversity doesn't get better just because you fund scholarships and programs (as helpful and necessary as those are!). Diversity happens because underprivileged people have access and support.
Your contributions will help us make entrepreneurship pathways and skills available to people who typically wouldn't access them.

Our goal is to collectively buy a bus, retrofit it, and drive it on an epic journey from America to Argentina. Along the way, we’ll be meeting all sorts of different people from different walks of life. We’ll be doing volunteer work and community outreach, trying to learn about other cultures and maybe teach a bit about our own way of life. The whole time, we’ll be photographing and documenting it online for you to enjoy!<p></p>
</div><p></p><h3>What We Need </h3><div>
<p>*We need to refurbish the bus! Right now the bus still has seats -- we want to turn those into bunks. We want to repaint the bus. We want to add a ports-potty to the bus, and attach solar panels so it'll be possible to charge all sorts of devices. To do that we need money!</p>
<p>*We need to pay for the bus! Lovely friends lent us money to buy the vehicle a couple of weeks ago, but they need to be paid back.</p>
<p>*We need gas! Driving down the Pan-American Highway can't (yet) be done on solar power, sadly.</p>
<p>*We need food! Most of the places we're volunteering won't feed us, and we're gonna need to cook in the rough sometimes. Anything that'll help us afford camp food, as well as tools for food prep, will be appreciated.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>

Hunde-Schwimmbad

Viele
Hunde Lieben Schwimmen oder herumtollen im Wasser. Das ist allerdings
nicht immer so einfach möglich, da die meisten Flüsse, so auch der
Main an dessen Ufer es liegt, viele Gefahren bergen wie
Schiffsverkehr und starke Strömungen. Das Hundeschwimmbad ist ein
Familienprojekt, um Hunden die Spaß am Herumtollen im Wasser haben,
oder etwa unter Gelenk und Muskelproblemen leiden eine Möglichkeit
zu bieten sich sicher und sorgenfrei zu Bewegen. 




Was machen wir ?
Wir
bauen eines der ersten Hundeschwimmbäder Deutschlands. Es gibt drei
große Schwimmbecken in unterschiedlichen Höhen für Hunde aller
Größen und ein weitläufiges Planschbecken zum Herumtollen.


             
Außerdem haben wir Duschen und Trockenplätze für die Vierbeiner
und einen Café Bereich zum Ausruhen und Essen für die Zweibeiner.
Die Besitzer können mit Ihrem Liebling vom Beckenrand aus Spaß
haben, mit ihm spielen oder ihn einfach beim Schwimmen beobachten.

<p><u><b>In
the meantime, Government &amp; Social Services Cannot Cover the Growing needs
For Help</b></u></p>
<p><b>These
are the main reasons that gave birth to the idea of ​​All4One</b>.</p>
<p>Our
aim is to build an application that will provide help to social institutions,
social structures as general, refugees, homeless &amp; poor people, all of our
fellow citizens that have crucial needs and they are not able to fulfill. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>All4One Application is a Non-Profit Effort &amp; that is why your contribution is vital.</h4>
<p>We
are confident that All4One  Application
will raise the solidarity feeling by making a donation of products, food, money
etc very easy and quick.</p>
<p>Moreover,
our goal is to spread the usage of All4One to the whole world by starting the
successful usage from our country, Greece.</p>
</div><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">All4One
Application – What Is All About</span></h2><p>One
of the most common problems for someone who wheeling to donate food, clothes
and other similar products, is the luck of time to do so. </p>
<p>Also,
the institution might be far from work or home and this can be a reason why so
many people postpone their donation of physical products.</p>
<p>Another
problem that a donor faces is the luck of information for the needs of each
institution. That is why many times the donations are not compatible with the
real institution needs.</p>
<p>Apart
the physical products, the institutions have a crucial need for fundraising, in
order tocover
everyday needs. Furthermore
they have to cover the needs for funds for a
specific purpose such as maintenance etc. </p>
<p>In
order to succeed this fundraising, the institution has to
create a mechanism to inform people
and raise money.</p>
<p>Everybody as an individual, we see
homeless, poor people on the streets, on our way to work,
and
we consider by which way we can change all this,
by which way we can do something to help. </p>
<p>We feel that any effort will not have any
affect as individual. But, if we could motivate our fellow citizens for the
same cause, what the results will be?</p>

<p>We want to be transparent on how we spend the funds from our supporters. Here is a projection of how the funds will be spent <b>within a one year plan</b>:</p>

<p></p>
<p><u><b>Summary
Of Cost For the First Year:</b></u></p>
<p><b>Application
Development: 23,000</b></p>

Up Cost (PC, Office Desks etc):
9,000$</b></p>

Cost: 33,000$</b></p>
<p><b>Total:

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The most crucial point as our financial target of 79,000$, is to cover the cost of All4One Application Development, therefore the 23,000$ cost.</b></p>

</div>
<br/><p>The first thing that you get is the satisfaction that you are a part of an effort that combines the technology with Solidarity. </p>
<p>The perks that we offer are more as recognition of your vital contribution to make this application a reality, rather than a measurable profit.</p>
<p>To be more precise we offer references of your contribution to media that we take part as a promotion of All4One, our social media, website etc.</p>
<p>Also we offer items created by the Social Institutions that we help via our application. Cups, T Shirts, Postcards etc</p>
<p>We offer you as recognition of your contribution the chance to be a member of our team. You can be an adviser for solidarity aspects, or even for technical and other issues. </p>
<p>In case of a company contribution, a member of our staff will inform you 4 your benefits.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The most crucial obstacle to confront is to cover the yearly expenses of the project. At first glance it seems difficult, but you have to consider that many companies have already showed their interest to sponsor the application via advertising and other methods that we came up in order to attract profit so as to cover our operational needs.</p>
<p>Another problem that we must face is to have quick deliveries of the physical donations such as clothes, food etc. This problem solved by a courier company and also by our system. All4one UI is designed in such way to make the procedure very easy for the user and social institution and therefore to cover the need of immediate deliveries. </p>
<p>We already created a 5 year business plan, where we took into account several issues concerning economic, personnel, technical and other aspects.</p>
<p>We can assure you 4 the success of the application.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>If you find our effort very important at first we must thank you and ensure you that we try our best to succeed &amp; create this important application.</p>
<p>Don't be sad if you are not able to contribute by money.</p>
<p>You can also contribute by spreading the news! </p>
<p>The creation of this application can help people all over the world, apart Greece. </p>
<p>So you can help by spreading the word. By making this effort well known to all your friends. </p>
<p>Also you can contribute by finding Social Institution near you to make a contact with All4One CEO and team.</p>
<p>Use the Indiegogo Share Tools! It will be a vital help!</p>

<p>Στόχος μας
είναι να δημιουργήσουμε μια εφαρμογή που θα αποτελεί σημαντικό εργαλείο στην
προσπάθεια όλων μας για βοήθεια του συνανθρώπου μας που έχει ανάγκη.</p>
<p>Στόχος η
βοήθεια κοινωνικών ιδρυμάτων, κοινωνικών δομών, αστέγων, ανθρώπων που ζουν κάτω
από το όριο της φτώχειας, προσφύγων από τις εμπόλεμες και μη ζώνες, όλων γενικά
των συνανθρώπων μας που έχουν ανάγκη από την συνεισφορά μας.</p>
<p>Η εφαρμογή All4One είναι κοινωφελούς σκοπού, το οποίο
συνεπάγεται ότι είναι μια μη κερδοσκοπική προσπάθεια.</p>
<p>Συνεπώς η βοήθεια σας για να γίνει η
εφαρμογή All4One πραγματικότητα είναι σημαντική και
απαραίτητη.</p>
<p>Η κρίση
στην Ελλάδα έχει καταφέρει ένα καίριο πλήγμα στην κοινωνική δομή της χώρας μας.
Όλο και περισσότεροι συμπολίτες μας ζούνε κάτω από το όριο της φτώχειας.</p>
<p>Οι Έλληνες
ως λαός έχουμε πολύ υψηλό το αίσθημα της αλληλοϋποστήριξης, της οικογένειας και
της βοήθειας προς τον συνάνθρωπο μας.</p>
<p>Τρανταχτό παράδειγμα
ανθρωπιάς και της κουλτούρας που διέπει την Ελληνική κοινωνία είναι ότι παρά τις
εγχώριες σημαντικές ανάγκες, οι Έλληνες έχουν στηρίξει τους ερχόμενους
πρόσφυγες από τις εμπόλεμες ζώνες με ανθρωπιά τέτοια που αποτελεί το παράδειγμα
για την Παγκόσμια κοινωνία.</p>
<p>Ως ομάδα
του All4One, είμαστε πεπεισμένοι ότι η εφαρμογή αυτή θα βοηθήσει τα μέγιστα ώστε να
αυξηθεί το επίπεδο αλληλεγγύης μας προς τον συνάνθρωπό μας, καθώς θα κάνει κάθε
δωρεά φυσικού αγαθού ή/και χρημάτων μια πολύ εύκολη υπόθεση.  </p>
<p>Η αρχή για
την προσπάθεια μας γίνεται στην χώρα μας, που πλήττεται περισσότερο από κάθε
άλλη από την οικονομική κρίση, στοχεύοντας η εφαρμογή μας να προσαρμόζεται με
τέτοιο τρόπο ώστε να μπορεί να αποτελεί ένα χρήσιμο εργαλείο για κάθε χώρα.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Πως γεννήθηκε λοιπόν η ιδέα για την
δημιουργία της εφαρμογής </b><b>All</b><b>4</b><b>One</b><b>, πως λειτουργεί και πως θα βοηθήσει;</b></p>
<p>Πριν την
οικονομική κρίση, οι Έλληνες αποτελούσαν έναν από τους πιο αισιόδοξους λαούς της
Ευρώπης. </p>
<p>Το 2009, η
οικονομική κρίση χτύπησε την πόρτα της Ελλάδας, με καταστροφικά αποτελέσματα
τόσο στις οικονομικές όσο και στις κοινωνικές δομές της χώρας.</p>
<p>Ενδεικτικά
της κατάστασης που έχει διαμορφωθεί είναι τα παρακάτω στατιστικά μεγέθη: </p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Προσπαθώντας
η Ελλάδα και οι πολίτες της να ανταπεξέλθουν στα νέα δεδομένα από αυτή την
εγχώρια οικονομική και κοινωνική κρίση, μια νέα πρόκληση ήρθε να προστεθεί.
Αυτή της αντιμετώπισης των προσφύγων από τις εμπόλεμες ζώνες, πχ της Συρίας.</p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>Οι Έλληνες
αποτελούν το λαμπρό παράδειγμα για όλη την Ευρώπη στην αντιμετώπιση των
προσφύγων. </p>
<p>Παρ όλη την
εγχώρια κρίση, οι Έλληνες έχουν σώσει, περιθάλψει και βοηθήσει αμέτρητους
πρόσφυγες και συμμετέχουν στο δράμα των ανθρώπων αυτών που ξεριζώθηκαν από τους
τόπους τους.</p>

<p><b>Σε αυτή την προσπάθεια, αναλαμβάνει
δράση η εφαρμογή μας, </b><b>All</b><b>4</b><b>One</b><b>.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Πολλοί από
εμάς θέλουμε να προσφέρουμε από το υστέρημα μας αλλά δεν γνωρίζουμε πως, που και
με πιο τρόπο να το πράξουμε.</p>
<p>Από την
άλλη, οι κοινωφελής οργανισμοί και τα ιδρύματα δεν έχουν κάποιο εργαλείο ώστε
να επικοινωνήσουν τις ανάγκες τους σε κάθε δεδομένη στιγμή και να βρουν τις κατάλληλες
δωρεές τόσο υλικά όσο και χρηματικά.</p>
<p>Έτσι ακόμα
και αν κάποιος από εμάς θελήσει να κάνει μια δωρεά σε κάποιο συγκεκριμένο
ίδρυμα, είναι πολύ πιθανό η δωρεά του να μην είναι η επιθυμητή σε σχέση με τις πραγματικές
ανάγκες του εκάστοτε οργανισμού ή συνανθρώπου μας.</p>
<p>Επίσης, η
ανάγκη χρημάτων από τα ιδρύματα για κάποιον σκοπό (πχ η ανακαίνιση, η σίτιση
κτλ) δεν μπορεί να προωθηθεί και στην συνέχεια να εισπράξει τις αναμενόμενες
δωρεές.</p>
<p>Τέλος,
πολλοί από εμάς θέλουμε να βοηθήσουμε κάποιον συνάνθρωπο μας που βρίσκετε κοντά
μας, αλλά αισθανόμαστε ότι είμαστε μόνοι σε αυτή την προσπάθεια</p>
<p>Όλα τα
παραπάνω μπορούν εύκολα να γίνουν μέσα από την εφαρμογή All4One. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ας δούμε τις

<p>Παρόλο που
πολλοί από εμάς είμαστε ευαισθητοποιημένοι σε κοινωνικά θέματα και έτοιμοι να
προσφέρουμε την βοήθεια μας, ο χρόνος και τα προσωπικά μας προβλήματα και υποχρεώσεις
μας κάνουν να δείχνουμε αδιάφοροι.</p>

All4OneSolidarity To All - Together We Can Succeed More




Before
the Greek Economic Crisis which Started on 2009, Greeks Ranked to be Among the
Most Optimistic People in Europe.
But
then, The Economic Crisis Knocked Greece's Door, bringing Negative Results in
Economy and Social Structure of Greece.
The Results in Economy and Social Structure of Greece are enormous. Some  useful statistics: 


Greece
must also address another critical situation. The rescue, the hosting
and hospitalization of the refugees from warzones like Syria.












In
the meantime, Government & Social Services Cannot Cover the Growing needs
For Help
These
are the main reasons that gave birth to the idea of ​​All4One.
Our
aim is to build an application that will provide help to social institutions,
social structures as general, refugees, homeless & poor people, all of our
fellow citizens that have crucial needs and they are not able to fulfill. 

All4One Application is a Non-Profit Effort & that is why your contribution is vital.
We
are confident that All4One  Application
will raise the solidarity feeling by making a donation of products, food, money
etc very easy and quick.
Moreover,
our goal is to spread the usage of All4One to the whole world by starting the
successful usage from our country, Greece.
All4One
Application – What Is All AboutOne
of the most common problems for someone who wheeling to donate food, clothes
and other similar products, is the luck of time to do so. 
Also,
the institution might be far from work or home and this can be a reason why so
many people postpone their donation of physical products.
Another
problem that a donor faces is the luck of information for the needs of each
institution. That is why many times the donations are not compatible with the
real institution needs.
Apart
the physical products, the institutions have a crucial need for fundraising, in
order tocover
everyday needs. Furthermore
they have to cover the needs for funds for a
specific purpose such as maintenance etc. 
In
order to succeed this fundraising, the institution has to
create a mechanism to inform people
and raise money.
Everybody as an individual, we see
homeless, poor people on the streets, on our way to work,
and
we consider by which way we can change all this,
by which way we can do something to help. 
We feel that any effort will not have any
affect as individual. But, if we could motivate our fellow citizens for the
same cause, what the results will be?
There is where, All4One take Action.

  
These Three basic Features of All4One Application:




All4One Drop Off Donation SpotsDonate Products Easily


Although Many of us Are Very Sensitive to
Social Needs & Ready to Help, Time & Several Obligations Make us to
Look Like we Don’t Care
All4OneApplication
is the solution.
By
one touch of your screen you can have all the information about the Social
Institutions, contact info, their needs etc. 
By
using All4One you can match your donation with the institution that has the
most need of your solidarity.






All4One Saves you Time to Make a Great Good 4 Many People. Just follow Some Simple Steps:

Your Donation

All4One FundRaising CampaignsDonate Money Easily






Social

Specific Needs.  
They
Create a Campaign Announcing the Purpose, the Funds They Expect to Rise &
the ending date of the campaign.
You
Can Easily Contribute and Be a Part of Their Effort.
Don’t
Forget That Your Solidarity is Very Crucial 4 These Institutions.



Your Social Group of MotivationMake Your Own Campaign 4 A Reason

But
You feel like you Are Alone for this cause. 
Or
You Think So?
All4One
Gives You The Necessary Tools To Find Help From Other People to Solve Any
Social Issue Near You.

Make Your Own Social Group 4 A Reason & Be The Solver.
Motivate People, Make The Difference  

What We Need 


Help us to Spread the Word. To make this application a vital tool for quick & precise donations. 
Donate to our campaign in Indiegogo to Make All4One application a Reality
''Help Our Effort & Join our Community""
We want to be transparent on how we spend the funds from our supporters. Here is a projection of how the funds will be spent within a one year plan:


Summary
Of Cost For the First Year:
Application
Development: 23,000
Start
Up Cost (PC, Office Desks etc):
9,000$
OPEX
( Renting etc):
14,000$
Personnel
Cost: 33,000$
Total:
79,000$

The most crucial point as our financial target of 79,000$, is to cover the cost of All4One Application Development, therefore the 23,000$ cost.
Once we cover this amount, our team will procceed with the development, regardless the amount of funds that we will rise from Indiegogo.

Perks - What You Get for Your Contribution

The first thing that you get is the satisfaction that you are a part of an effort that combines the technology with Solidarity. 
The perks that we offer are more as recognition of your vital contribution to make this application a reality, rather than a measurable profit.
To be more precise we offer references of your contribution to media that we take part as a promotion of All4One, our social media, website etc.
Also we offer items created by the Social Institutions that we help via our application. Cups, T Shirts, Postcards etc
We offer you as recognition of your contribution the chance to be a member of our team. You can be an adviser for solidarity aspects, or even for technical and other issues. 
In case of a company contribution, a member of our staff will inform you 4 your benefits.


    Risks & Challenges The most crucial obstacle to confront is to cover the yearly expenses of the project. At first glance it seems difficult, but you have to consider that many companies have already showed their interest to sponsor the application via advertising and other methods that we came up in order to attract profit so as to cover our operational needs.
Another problem that we must face is to have quick deliveries of the physical donations such as clothes, food etc. This problem solved by a courier company and also by our system. All4one UI is designed in such way to make the procedure very easy for the user and social institution and therefore to cover the need of immediate deliveries. 
We already created a 5 year business plan, where we took into account several issues concerning economic, personnel, technical and other aspects.
We can assure you 4 the success of the application.


Other Ways You Can Help

If you find our effort very important at first we must thank you and ensure you that we try our best to succeed & create this important application.

All4One – Αλληλεγγύη για
Όλους
Μαζί Μπορούμε να Πετύχουμε
Περισσότερα

Στόχος μας
είναι να δημιουργήσουμε μια εφαρμογή που θα αποτελεί σημαντικό εργαλείο στην
προσπάθεια όλων μας για βοήθεια του συνανθρώπου μας που έχει ανάγκη.
Στόχος η
βοήθεια κοινωνικών ιδρυμάτων, κοινωνικών δομών, αστέγων, ανθρώπων που ζουν κάτω
από το όριο της φτώχειας, προσφύγων από τις εμπόλεμες και μη ζώνες, όλων γενικά
των συνανθρώπων μας που έχουν ανάγκη από την συνεισφορά μας.
Η εφαρμογή All4One είναι κοινωφελούς σκοπού, το οποίο
συνεπάγεται ότι είναι μια μη κερδοσκοπική προσπάθεια.
Συνεπώς η βοήθεια σας για να γίνει η
εφαρμογή All4One πραγματικότητα είναι σημαντική και
απαραίτητη.
Η κρίση
στην Ελλάδα έχει καταφέρει ένα καίριο πλήγμα στην κοινωνική δομή της χώρας μας.
Όλο και περισσότεροι συμπολίτες μας ζούνε κάτω από το όριο της φτώχειας.
Οι Έλληνες
ως λαός έχουμε πολύ υψηλό το αίσθημα της αλληλοϋποστήριξης, της οικογένειας και
της βοήθειας προς τον συνάνθρωπο μας.
Τρανταχτό παράδειγμα
ανθρωπιάς και της κουλτούρας που διέπει την Ελληνική κοινωνία είναι ότι παρά τις
εγχώριες σημαντικές ανάγκες, οι Έλληνες έχουν στηρίξει τους ερχόμενους
πρόσφυγες από τις εμπόλεμες ζώνες με ανθρωπιά τέτοια που αποτελεί το παράδειγμα
για την Παγκόσμια κοινωνία.
Ως ομάδα
του All4One, είμαστε πεπεισμένοι ότι η εφαρμογή αυτή θα βοηθήσει τα μέγιστα ώστε να
αυξηθεί το επίπεδο αλληλεγγύης μας προς τον συνάνθρωπό μας, καθώς θα κάνει κάθε
δωρεά φυσικού αγαθού ή/και χρημάτων μια πολύ εύκολη υπόθεση.  
Η αρχή για
την προσπάθεια μας γίνεται στην χώρα μας, που πλήττεται περισσότερο από κάθε
άλλη από την οικονομική κρίση, στοχεύοντας η εφαρμογή μας να προσαρμόζεται με
τέτοιο τρόπο ώστε να μπορεί να αποτελεί ένα χρήσιμο εργαλείο για κάθε χώρα.

Πως γεννήθηκε λοιπόν η ιδέα για την
δημιουργία της εφαρμογής All4One, πως λειτουργεί και πως θα βοηθήσει;
Πριν την
οικονομική κρίση, οι Έλληνες αποτελούσαν έναν από τους πιο αισιόδοξους λαούς της
Ευρώπης. 
Το 2009, η
οικονομική κρίση χτύπησε την πόρτα της Ελλάδας, με καταστροφικά αποτελέσματα
τόσο στις οικονομικές όσο και στις κοινωνικές δομές της χώρας.
Ενδεικτικά
της κατάστασης που έχει διαμορφωθεί είναι τα παρακάτω στατιστικά μεγέθη: 





Προσπαθώντας
η Ελλάδα και οι πολίτες της να ανταπεξέλθουν στα νέα δεδομένα από αυτή την
εγχώρια οικονομική και κοινωνική κρίση, μια νέα πρόκληση ήρθε να προστεθεί.
Αυτή της αντιμετώπισης των προσφύγων από τις εμπόλεμες ζώνες, πχ της Συρίας.









Οι Έλληνες
αποτελούν το λαμπρό παράδειγμα για όλη την Ευρώπη στην αντιμετώπιση των
προσφύγων. 
Παρ όλη την
εγχώρια κρίση, οι Έλληνες έχουν σώσει, περιθάλψει και βοηθήσει αμέτρητους
πρόσφυγες και συμμετέχουν στο δράμα των ανθρώπων αυτών που ξεριζώθηκαν από τους
τόπους τους.





Σε αυτή την προσπάθεια των πολιτών,
η κυβέρνηση και οι κοινωνικές οργανώσεις φαίνεται να έχουν φτάσει στα όρια των
αντοχών τους, και η αυξανόμενη ανάγκη για βοήθεια δεν είναι δυνατόν να την
παρέχουν αποτελεσματικά.










Σε αυτή την προσπάθεια, αναλαμβάνει
δράση η εφαρμογή μας, All4One.

Πολλοί από
εμάς θέλουμε να προσφέρουμε από το υστέρημα μας αλλά δεν γνωρίζουμε πως, που και
με πιο τρόπο να το πράξουμε.
Από την
άλλη, οι κοινωφελής οργανισμοί και τα ιδρύματα δεν έχουν κάποιο εργαλείο ώστε
να επικοινωνήσουν τις ανάγκες τους σε κάθε δεδομένη στιγμή και να βρουν τις κατάλληλες
δωρεές τόσο υλικά όσο και χρηματικά.
Έτσι ακόμα
και αν κάποιος από εμάς θελήσει να κάνει μια δωρεά σε κάποιο συγκεκριμένο
ίδρυμα, είναι πολύ πιθανό η δωρεά του να μην είναι η επιθυμητή σε σχέση με τις πραγματικές
ανάγκες του εκάστοτε οργανισμού ή συνανθρώπου μας.
Επίσης, η
ανάγκη χρημάτων από τα ιδρύματα για κάποιον σκοπό (πχ η ανακαίνιση, η σίτιση
κτλ) δεν μπορεί να προωθηθεί και στην συνέχεια να εισπράξει τις αναμενόμενες
δωρεές.
Τέλος,
πολλοί από εμάς θέλουμε να βοηθήσουμε κάποιον συνάνθρωπο μας που βρίσκετε κοντά
μας, αλλά αισθανόμαστε ότι είμαστε μόνοι σε αυτή την προσπάθεια
Όλα τα
παραπάνω μπορούν εύκολα να γίνουν μέσα από την εφαρμογή All4One.

πολλοί από εμάς είμαστε ευαισθητοποιημένοι σε κοινωνικά θέματα και έτοιμοι να
προσφέρουμε την βοήθεια μας, ο χρόνος και τα προσωπικά μας προβλήματα και υποχρεώσεις
μας κάνουν να δείχνουμε αδιάφοροι.

</ol><h2><b>Our Story </b></h2><p><b></b></p><p>I was born in
Central Pennsylvania where I grew up in foster care till I was 17 and then
enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. 
I was stationed at Cherry Point North Carolina where I served honorably
for 4 years from 1999-2003.   After 2 years I started attending college in
NC, till I came home to Pennsylvania to finish at West Chester University near
Philadelphia. <b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">I met Mark my business partner in
2010, after asking him for some help with making a center console for my older
Jeep Wrangler, since looking online and in stores did not help me find one
that fit my older Jeep. Because Mark is also prior military we got along great from the start.  While working on
that project in his garage, we started talking about some of the tools he had for
wood working in his garage.  That
conversation led into how much we both loved the smell of working with wood and
making furniture pieces out of solid wood. 
We then started talking about some the things we learned through our
experiences about the whole furniture buying process, and how it is extremely
difficult finding furniture that fits our budget, space and our needs. </p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>The Problem</b></h2><p></p><p><b>Finding furniture that fits is hard, but here at Functional Furniture Creations we are pioneering ways to make the search for furniture
that fits obsolete. </b> With apartment
development on the rise, where square footage is considerable smaller and more
appealing than that of a traditional home, and home loans harder to get due to tightening
loan restrictions, we have to take a step back and reevaluate the way our furniture
is designed and manufactured.  Every
consumer knows the struggle of dragging furniture through an ever changing lifestyle
and living environment. These transitions in our life often raise some
questions concerning the way traditional furniture is manufactured and sold.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455556177/ypatcjcb41nby9yzmpxa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><ul>

furniture is an emotional purchase that is usually triggered by a life changing
event, such as getting married, purchasing a home, having children or moving, this means that a person within the United States can buy new furniture up to 9 times within their lifetime.</p><p>When we take these into account and look at the average cost of a 5 piece bedroom set we get 2 sets of numbers. The first set of numbers, which we call the low budget category, includes furniture that is made with a low cost associated with it.  This includes furniture made of particle board (with a veneer to look like real wood), plastic, pressed board, (made with formaldehyde) plywood, and disposable furniture .  The second set of numbers includes furniture that is solid wood with only plywood used as a drawer bottom.  </p><p></p><ol>

<li><b>$3000 total on master bedroom furniture (including bed, dresser, mirror, and night stands)</b></li>
</ol><div>Considering that  adults over the age of 18 who will move up to 9 times in their lifetime and can buy furniture each time they do so, that means that the average American can spend close to $30000 for bedroom furniture alone.<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Since we have designed a dresser that adapts to the customers needs, makes it easy to transition from one lifestyle change to another, and accommodates changes to living arrangements and moving, we are helping to protect customers wallets without them even knowing it. </span>
</div><h2><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Future Products</b></span></h2><div>We have many  other designs that are excited to bring to the world of furniture in the upcoming months.  They are currently on the drawing board and we are still working out the kinks and details.    </div><div>One such product we will be launching at a later date is an entertainment center that adjusts to
accommodate various room layouts, angles, and customer needs.   It will be built similar to our by dresser by the drawer concept, with the entertainment center being divided into sections or Modules to make it so that customers can  build it their way.  It will have an easy attachment method and hinges so it easily adjusts to any room or wall layout that the customer wants to fit it in.  In
order to meet the needs for tech savvy consumers, the entertainment center will
feature options such as a hide away cord system, built in power strips or surge
protectors, built in wall mounting platform for elevated viewing pleasures, Wi-Fi
speakers preattached, and hide away game drawers.</div><div>A
third product still in the research and idea stage is an end table that doubles
as a removable/adjustable laptop desk. 
This piece of furniture will feature hide away cord tubes, and
telescopic, swiveling, pivoting and removable laptop desk for its top
shelf.  The tech savvy consumer will love this piece of furniture because it will have features like the entertainment center, such as a mounted power strips,  hideaway drawers for storing things you want to keep beside the couch, built in charging platforms, and also a laptop cooling system.   There are still a few things to
consider as to how we intend to produce and market this piece, but this is a line of products that we hope will help the modern consumer when it comes to keeping what they need where they want it.<br/>

Creations is run by 2 people, Matthew and Mark, who are both working full time
to try to make their dream a reality. Having been employed since the age of 16,
we both have learned a lot of things about the current state of the job
market.  Turnover ratio in this country
is at a pretty high rate compared to those of years prior, between 30-40%.  Upon doing research we have found there are
numerous reasons why employees leave one company for another.  A few of the main reasons are employees feel
they are underpaid, being overworked (doing the job of 2 or more people), underapprecciated,
and not being fully compensated for the work they are doing.  Overall most employers just are not making
their employee feel they are actually wanted. </span><br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>Having both been prior military and
experiencing the job market firsthand, we personally know the struggles that
most employees face.  One of the reasons
we created Functional Furniture Creations was to pioneer the way employees and
employers work together to create a better business.  We want to be a business that takes care of
its employees because they take care of our business.  We believe that an honest day’s work should
equal an honest day’s pay, so we will be basing starting pay off of
experience.  As we grow, we believe that
our employees should have the potential to grow as well.  We have programs already in place for those
that go above and beyond just working for us.  From extra incentives for helping to sell our
products, to training so that employees have a chance to grow personally and
financially.  We don’t want to just
create jobs but a family and careers dedicated to making quality innovative
furniture to help those transition the road of life.  At the end of the day we know happy employees
create better products, and are more willing to stand behind them.  So when we say our products are ""Made in
America"", you know they are made by people with pride who enjoy the work
they do.</p>

Risks and Challenges

Our Story I was born in
Central Pennsylvania where I grew up in foster care till I was 17 and then
enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. 
I was stationed at Cherry Point North Carolina where I served honorably
for 4 years from 1999-2003.   After 2 years I started attending college in
NC, till I came home to Pennsylvania to finish at West Chester University near
Philadelphia. I met Mark my business partner in
2010, after asking him for some help with making a center console for my older
Jeep Wrangler, since looking online and in stores did not help me find one
that fit my older Jeep. Because Mark is also prior military we got along great from the start.  While working on
that project in his garage, we started talking about some of the tools he had for
wood working in his garage.  That
conversation led into how much we both loved the smell of working with wood and
making furniture pieces out of solid wood. 
We then started talking about some the things we learned through our
experiences about the whole furniture buying process, and how it is extremely
difficult finding furniture that fits our budget, space and our needs. The ProblemFinding furniture that fits is hard, but here at Functional Furniture Creations we are pioneering ways to make the search for furniture
that fits obsolete.  With apartment
development on the rise, where square footage is considerable smaller and more
appealing than that of a traditional home, and home loans harder to get due to tightening
loan restrictions, we have to take a step back and reevaluate the way our furniture
is designed and manufactured.  Every
consumer knows the struggle of dragging furniture through an ever changing lifestyle
and living environment. These transitions in our life often raise some
questions concerning the way traditional furniture is manufactured and sold.
Why does solid wood furniture have to be such a huge upfront cost?
Why is particle board or plywood the only solution for lower budgets?
Why cant furniture be made to be versatile, multipurpose, and functional without sacrificing quality?
Why does furniture not adapt or grow to our needs and/or space?
Why does it have to be big and bulky?
Would it lower the cost upfront and allow us to buy and build slower to fit our budget if manufactured by the drawer?

Would people actually prefer a new and better way to do furniture, like us?

Modules, The Solution


Modules, our dresser by the drawer product solves many if not all of these questions and problems.  Modules are solid wood furniture that have several benefits designed right into it for us consumers.  

Modules let the customer build the dresser the way they need it at that time, saving money.


They are the only dresser out there designed to grow with your personal needs or lifestyle.


It is designed to be flexible to your living space and to allow easy adjustability.  


By building your own dresser or chest of drawers in this manner, it eliminates the huge upfront cost associated with buying solid wood furniture.  


If your needs or space requirements ever change, Modules is designed to allow the purchase and addition of drawers without the need of buying another whole additional piece of furniture.

You can complete a whole bedroom set with just one piece of furniture without having to match each new piece of furniture you buy.  Our dresser by the drawer design even allows easy maneuverability if the time comes that you ever have to move.Furniture has not changed in decades, whereas our needs as consumers have, Modules is our first product we are bringing to the market in hopes to change how furniture is made, marketed, and sold.  Modules is an innovative design built around the needs of the customer.  It is the first and only dresser designed to grow with your needs, change with your lifestyle, and adapt to your living environment.People AffectedAccording to data collected by the American Census Bureau it is estimated that a person in the United States can expect up to move 9 times within their lifetime after they reach the age of 18.  Considering
furniture is an emotional purchase that is usually triggered by a life changing
event, such as getting married, purchasing a home, having children or moving, this means that a person within the United States can buy new furniture up to 9 times within their lifetime.When we take these into account and look at the average cost of a 5 piece bedroom set we get 2 sets of numbers. The first set of numbers, which we call the low budget category, includes furniture that is made with a low cost associated with it.  This includes furniture made of particle board (with a veneer to look like real wood), plastic, pressed board, (made with formaldehyde) plywood, and disposable furniture .  The second set of numbers includes furniture that is solid wood with only plywood used as a drawer bottom.  
$1,199 total on master bedroom furniture (including bed, dresser, mirror, and night stands)
$3000 total on master bedroom furniture (including bed, dresser, mirror, and night stands)
Considering that  adults over the age of 18 who will move up to 9 times in their lifetime and can buy furniture each time they do so, that means that the average American can spend close to $30000 for bedroom furniture alone.Since we have designed a dresser that adapts to the customers needs, makes it easy to transition from one lifestyle change to another, and accommodates changes to living arrangements and moving, we are helping to protect customers wallets without them even knowing it. 
Future ProductsWe have many  other designs that are excited to bring to the world of furniture in the upcoming months.  They are currently on the drawing board and we are still working out the kinks and details.    One such product we will be launching at a later date is an entertainment center that adjusts to
accommodate various room layouts, angles, and customer needs.   It will be built similar to our by dresser by the drawer concept, with the entertainment center being divided into sections or Modules to make it so that customers can  build it their way.  It will have an easy attachment method and hinges so it easily adjusts to any room or wall layout that the customer wants to fit it in.  In
order to meet the needs for tech savvy consumers, the entertainment center will
feature options such as a hide away cord system, built in power strips or surge
protectors, built in wall mounting platform for elevated viewing pleasures, Wi-Fi
speakers preattached, and hide away game drawers.A
third product still in the research and idea stage is an end table that doubles
as a removable/adjustable laptop desk. 
This piece of furniture will feature hide away cord tubes, and
telescopic, swiveling, pivoting and removable laptop desk for its top
shelf.  The tech savvy consumer will love this piece of furniture because it will have features like the entertainment center, such as a mounted power strips,  hideaway drawers for storing things you want to keep beside the couch, built in charging platforms, and also a laptop cooling system.   There are still a few things to
consider as to how we intend to produce and market this piece, but this is a line of products that we hope will help the modern consumer when it comes to keeping what they need where they want it.
Our Company & Philosophy
Functional Furniture Creations wants to be more than just a furniture manufacturer and retailer, we are an innovative small new business out to change the way furniture is made and sold.  

Currently Functional Furniture
Creations is run by 2 people, Matthew and Mark, who are both working full time
to try to make their dream a reality. Having been employed since the age of 16,
we both have learned a lot of things about the current state of the job
market.  Turnover ratio in this country
is at a pretty high rate compared to those of years prior, between 30-40%.  Upon doing research we have found there are
numerous reasons why employees leave one company for another.  A few of the main reasons are employees feel
they are underpaid, being overworked (doing the job of 2 or more people), underapprecciated,
and not being fully compensated for the work they are doing.  Overall most employers just are not making
their employee feel they are actually wanted. 

Having both been prior military and
experiencing the job market firsthand, we personally know the struggles that
most employees face.  One of the reasons
we created Functional Furniture Creations was to pioneer the way employees and
employers work together to create a better business.  We want to be a business that takes care of

<h3>What we're about </h3>
<p><strong>RebelRouser is a start-up company developing an online hub for activism.</strong> It is a place where people who want to get involved by making a difference, or by becoming better informed, can come to connect and inspire one another.  </p>
<p>We not only inspire at RebelRouser, but support activism practically, by <strong>creating the first online learning and resource library dedicated to creating socio-economic change.</strong></p>
<p>Then we take it one step further. <strong>We host project competitions where you can bring your great ideas and get them funded</strong> through our community of RebelRousers. All revenue made from advertisements and donations are funneled back to support these projects and motivate people to get active. </p>
<p><strong>Your support will launch RebelRouser's cutting-edge online resource library</strong> and help us develop powerful, fact-based courses in politics, psychology, education, economics and more! <strong>Your contribution would furthermore push the development of our online activist platform and marketing campaign to get the word out. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your support will provide the means necessary to create a comprehensive education and project platform website dedicated to supporting the success of real activists.<b> </b></p>
<p><strong>First, we need to develop our product:</strong> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>A website</strong> that has three separate functions: </li></ul>
<ol style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>
<u>Resource Library</u>: <strong>An online database of informational resources that cover areas such as politics, education psychology, economics and law. </strong>
</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The goal is to provide a one-stop shop where people can learn new skills and be better informed about their current political and social environment. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2.<u> Courses</u>: <strong>RebelRouser is setting out to develop our own basic courses that provide critical, reliable information across disciplines that foster a more well-informed voting and activist community. </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">These courses will be available through an online membership and will resemble apps like Duolingo. The user will be able to add and complete courses and receive certification for their efforts that promote their legitimacy as change agents. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">3. <u>The Project Hub</u>: <strong>An online social platform that allows users to pitch project and movement ideas to the community and see what others are up to across the country.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The hub will host community-wide elections to determine which projects win publicity and funding through RebelRouser. This platform also includes a strategic ""search"" function to locate the projects you can get involved in or donate to in your area. Alternatively, users can access this function to find information about RebelRouser events taking place in a given location. Events may include local marches, talks or fundraisers that promote socio-economic or socio-political change. </p>
<ul><li>We need to be able to <strong>pay our staff</strong>!<ul><li>While our volunteers are incredible, we need several full-time dedicated employees to lift this project into the air and get it moving. To get there, we have to be able to pay our staff so that they can afford to treat this project as their highest priority. </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Thank you!! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Activists are and should be regular people. Lets get connected, inspired and funded. Lets Get rebellious. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>For this product to be what we envision, it is going to require a heavy initial investment</strong>. Until we have our basic website set up and functional, all we have is our kickass concept. After that, a lot is going to depend on us moving quickly and efficiently to make the most of the product available to us. </p>
<p>Speed and efficiency are something we are overwhelmingly qualified for.

</div></div>","What we're about 
RebelRouser is a start-up company developing an online hub for activism. It is a place where people who want to get involved by making a difference, or by becoming better informed, can come to connect and inspire one another.  
We not only inspire at RebelRouser, but support activism practically, by creating the first online learning and resource library dedicated to creating socio-economic change.
Then we take it one step further. We host project competitions where you can bring your great ideas and get them funded through our community of RebelRousers. All revenue made from advertisements and donations are funneled back to support these projects and motivate people to get active. 
Your support will launch RebelRouser's cutting-edge online resource library and help us develop powerful, fact-based courses in politics, psychology, education, economics and more! Your contribution would furthermore push the development of our online activist platform and marketing campaign to get the word out. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
Your support will provide the means necessary to create a comprehensive education and project platform website dedicated to supporting the success of real activists. 
First, we need to develop our product: 

A website that has three separate functions: 

Resource Library: An online database of informational resources that cover areas such as politics, education psychology, economics and law. 

The goal is to provide a one-stop shop where people can learn new skills and be better informed about their current political and social environment. 
2. Courses: RebelRouser is setting out to develop our own basic courses that provide critical, reliable information across disciplines that foster a more well-informed voting and activist community. 
These courses will be available through an online membership and will resemble apps like Duolingo. The user will be able to add and complete courses and receive certification for their efforts that promote their legitimacy as change agents. 
3. The Project Hub: An online social platform that allows users to pitch project and movement ideas to the community and see what others are up to across the country.
The hub will host community-wide elections to determine which projects win publicity and funding through RebelRouser. This platform also includes a strategic ""search"" function to locate the projects you can get involved in or donate to in your area. Alternatively, users can access this function to find information about RebelRouser events taking place in a given location. Events may include local marches, talks or fundraisers that promote socio-economic or socio-political change. 
We need to be able to pay our staff!While our volunteers are incredible, we need several full-time dedicated employees to lift this project into the air and get it moving. To get there, we have to be able to pay our staff so that they can afford to treat this project as their highest priority. 

Thank you!! 
 

What You Get
$250 donation 
Wow! You rebel you! Thank you in advance. Let us pamper you with a FREE membership for a year at RebelRouser AND a free Rebellious-T shirt mailed straight to your door. 
$100 donation or more 
In exchange for your generosity, we are proud to offer you a FREE membership with RebelRouser for a full year! This includes full access to our extensive online Resource Library, Activist Hub and Weekly RebelNews letter on our blog.

$15 donation or more 
You rock! We would like to thank you personally with a handmade watercolor thank you card. 
 
The Impact
We envision a world where people can be easily informed, trained and qualified to make meaningful societal change in their communities. We want our product to help make that a reality. 
Help meet the need for individuals to come together and strategize, communicate about and implement real change in their communities and in their lives.
Activists are and should be regular people. Lets get connected, inspired and funded. Lets Get rebellious. 

Risks & Challenges
For this product to be what we envision, it is going to require a heavy initial investment. Until we have our basic website set up and functional, all we have is our kickass concept. After that, a lot is going to depend on us moving quickly and efficiently to make the most of the product available to us. 
Speed and efficiency are something we are overwhelmingly qualified for. Our volunteers are all working on this project because they feel passionately about it and very much want to make sure it is the best it can be. What that means is that we have people working overtime on a project because they believe in it. And that's without funding that would allow us to pay them. The momentum driving us is immense--
We are simply in need of the resources to produce the aspects of this vision that passion alone can't achieve.

<p>Fossil Fuels Saison ale is brewed with 45-million-year-old yeast, extracted from Burmese Amber in 1992 by renowned microbiologist Raul Cano - the man the hailed by the Washington Post as the ""Real Life Jurassic Park Scientist"".  Fossil Fuels is hands down the World's most ancient beer.  Quite possibly, it's also its best, and tastes unlike anything else you'll ever have -- please see the tasting notes below.</p>
<p><b>The Story (short version) &amp; The Campaign:</b> After 24 years of harvesting and husbanding yeast, and countless test batches, we're finally on the home-stretch of bringing this amazing beer to market!  As such, we are <span style=""background-color: initial;"">offering early access to 1st Edition batches (replete with founders' autographs and authentic amber stones), Gala Invites, beer soap, t-shirts, taphandles, secret newsletter and stickers to those who pledge. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are running this campaign, and extending this offer because we are a small company, and<i> need help</i> to get over the final Research and Development cost-hurdles.  We are </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">looking to raise at least $40k in funding to bring history back to life.  Funds raised will help us build the right laboratory and infrastructure to better protect and nourish the yeast, to enhance capacity, and to bring more beer of more styles to the market faster.  Fact is, with a yeast this rare and unusual, The World may never get a second chance.  We need to get this right the first time!</span></p>

</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Tasting Notes &amp; Beer Statistics:</b></span></p>
<p>Saison's are a spectacular style of beer that date back hundreds of years -- beers built by the farmers along the French-Belgian border.  Crisp and refreshing enough to quench thirst in the hottest of heat, yet bodied and rugged enough to survive months of temperature-hostile summertime storage, Saison's are a beer-paradox. </p>
<p>K. Florian Kemp in All About Beer Magazine sums up the Saison style's appearance, flavour and finishing experience beautifully as: ""Burnished gold and lightly hazy with an impossibly dense and billowing rocky white head. The nose presents the unmistakable damp forest and leaf aroma of Goldings hops and yeast blend, with clove and tangerine. The mouthfeel is light and the flavor is hoppy, pleasantly organic and coarse.""  </p>
<p>Our ancient yeast takes this experience to another level - adding remarkable grapefruit, and at times almost light-papaya notes.  It adds a level of very light sweetness midway through the tasting sensation, but then allows that to fade away to provide a remarkably clean finish.  So the next taste enables you to relive the same pleasurable sensation.</p>
<p>It's remarkable.</p>
<p>The stats below will not reflect the final product, but will describe our most recent test batch of the Saison. </p>
<p>- ABV (alcohol by volume): 5.9% </p>
<p>- SRM (Standard Reference Model - read color) : 3.2 [a light golden]</p>
<p>- IBU (International Bittering Units):  31 [twice that of an English brown; half to a third that of a modern California IPA]</p>
<p><b style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;'>The Team:</b><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> - Dr. Raul Cano is a Professor Emeritus at the California Polytechnic State University, and is the first scientist ever to isolate viable DNA from an amber crystal.  Having successfully harvested live cells from an ancient bee, he's the very embodiment of the science behind Jurassic Park.  Fortunately, he chose to bring ale-yeast back.  Not dinosaurs.  Check out a younger Raul in action on Discovery Channel <a href=""https://youtu.be/IlRbHiuP-PY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> (from about 1:50 into the video).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Chip Lambert is another microbiologist, who ironically was hired to debunk Raul's findings back in 1993.    The science world was highly skeptical of what Raul pulled off, but instead of disproving it, Chip was shocked to find out Raul was right.  They quickly bonded and partnered to found Fossil Fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">- Ian Schuster is the CEO and Founder of Schubros Brewery in San Ramon, California.  He's partnering with Raul and Chip to bring this completely unprecedented product to market. </span></p>
<p><b>The future:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is just the beginning. <strike>If</strike> When we are successful, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">additional funds will go towards setting up a dedicated </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">facility that will create more amazing beers using not only this 45-million- year-old </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">yeast cultures, but also another 25-million-year-old culture (mere youngsters!) Raul has also managed to resurrect. </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So to celebrate and say thank you, in addition to the normal perks we're also setting some Extra-Thank-You thresholds:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we break $250,000 we'll give commemorative campaign t-shirts to everyone who pledges at voucher level or higher.</span></li>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we hit $500,000 in this campaign, all supporters at the voucher l</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">evel or higher will also get VIP early rights to our next 45-million- year-old- yeast </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">brew, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fossil Fuels Wheat.  </span>

</div></div>","Secure Early-VIP Access & Help bring the world's oldest beer to market!
 Have your reached this page after the campaign has ended and is closed for new orders?  If so, fret not.  You can jump over to our brewery page here for the rest of September and score the same great stuff -- although not with these Indiegogo discounts.  If you're still in time, and this campaign's still running, please read on!
Fossil Fuels Saison ale is brewed with 45-million-year-old yeast, extracted from Burmese Amber in 1992 by renowned microbiologist Raul Cano - the man the hailed by the Washington Post as the ""Real Life Jurassic Park Scientist"".  Fossil Fuels is hands down the World's most ancient beer.  Quite possibly, it's also its best, and tastes unlike anything else you'll ever have -- please see the tasting notes below.
The Story (short version) & The Campaign: After 24 years of harvesting and husbanding yeast, and countless test batches, we're finally on the home-stretch of bringing this amazing beer to market!  As such, we are offering early access to 1st Edition batches (replete with founders' autographs and authentic amber stones), Gala Invites, beer soap, t-shirts, taphandles, secret newsletter and stickers to those who pledge. 
We are running this campaign, and extending this offer because we are a small company, and need help to get over the final Research and Development cost-hurdles.  We are looking to raise at least $40k in funding to bring history back to life.  Funds raised will help us build the right laboratory and infrastructure to better protect and nourish the yeast, to enhance capacity, and to bring more beer of more styles to the market faster.  Fact is, with a yeast this rare and unusual, The World may never get a second chance.  We need to get this right the first time!

Curious about our journey? Please check out our embedded short video about the beer, how it all got started, the perks we're offering, and what we look to achieve. The picture gallery also includes pictures from our product development efforts.

But if you want to know how different yeast affects beer flavor, I hope you have a free week or two.  The effect is massive and virtually beyond description. Best to listen to your own tongue. And the rare opera our Fossil Fuels yeast will serenade you with, is like nothing any internet or pen-yielding guru shall have enjoyed before.

Tasting Notes & Beer Statistics:
Saison's are a spectacular style of beer that date back hundreds of years -- beers built by the farmers along the French-Belgian border.  Crisp and refreshing enough to quench thirst in the hottest of heat, yet bodied and rugged enough to survive months of temperature-hostile summertime storage, Saison's are a beer-paradox. 
K. Florian Kemp in All About Beer Magazine sums up the Saison style's appearance, flavour and finishing experience beautifully as: ""Burnished gold and lightly hazy with an impossibly dense and billowing rocky white head. The nose presents the unmistakable damp forest and leaf aroma of Goldings hops and yeast blend, with clove and tangerine. The mouthfeel is light and the flavor is hoppy, pleasantly organic and coarse.""  
Our ancient yeast takes this experience to another level - adding remarkable grapefruit, and at times almost light-papaya notes.  It adds a level of very light sweetness midway through the tasting sensation, but then allows that to fade away to provide a remarkably clean finish.  So the next taste enables you to relive the same pleasurable sensation.
It's remarkable.
The stats below will not reflect the final product, but will describe our most recent test batch of the Saison. 
- ABV (alcohol by volume): 5.9% 
- SRM (Standard Reference Model - read color) : 3.2 [a light golden]
- IBU (International Bittering Units):  31 [twice that of an English brown; half to a third that of a modern California IPA]
The Team:
 - Dr. Raul Cano is a Professor Emeritus at the California Polytechnic State University, and is the first scientist ever to isolate viable DNA from an amber crystal.  Having successfully harvested live cells from an ancient bee, he's the very embodiment of the science behind Jurassic Park.  Fortunately, he chose to bring ale-yeast back.  Not dinosaurs.  Check out a younger Raul in action on Discovery Channel here (from about 1:50 into the video).
- Chip Lambert is another microbiologist, who ironically was hired to debunk Raul's findings back in 1993.    The science world was highly skeptical of what Raul pulled off, but instead of disproving it, Chip was shocked to find out Raul was right.  They quickly bonded and partnered to found Fossil Fuels.
- Ian Schuster is the CEO and Founder of Schubros Brewery in San Ramon, California.  He's partnering with Raul and Chip to bring this completely unprecedented product to market. 
The future:

This is just the beginning. If When we are successful, additional funds will go towards setting up a dedicated facility that will create more amazing beers using not only this 45-million- year-old yeast cultures, but also another 25-million-year-old culture (mere youngsters!) Raul has also managed to resurrect. 
So to celebrate and say thank you, in addition to the normal perks we're also setting some Extra-Thank-You thresholds:


If we break $250,000 we'll give commemorative campaign t-shirts to everyone who pledges at voucher level or higher.

If we hit $500,000 in this campaign, all supporters at the voucher level or higher will also get VIP early rights to our next 45-million- year-old- yeast brew, Fossil Fuels Wheat.  

If we hit $750,000 or above, ""Voucher level"" and above pledgers will get Fossil Fuels Amber VIP early rights as well.

Finally, if you can help us spread the word and are of age, we'll route you a voucher as thanks. Just contribute at any level, send an email to marketing@schubrosbrewery.com with the names and contact info of 5 other persons you talked to, who also contributed at any level, and after verifying you're their inspiration, we'll get you that voucher for another piece of history!

My
name is Ian Wickison and I live in northern Brazil with my American
wife, Mary. I'm British, 65 years old, and a right leg below knee
amputee.  Although my background covers commercial diving  and
professional photography,   I have been involved with
agriculture on and off for most of my life. </p>
<p>
Our
coconut farm which is on eight acres, was born of the idea to produce organically grown trees
which produce the highly nutritional and healthy coconut water at a price that the local Brazilians can afford.  Also, we wanted to secure a safe wildlife area for the vast variety of species  found here.   We
planted over 400 trees 2 years ago, which are doing extremely
well and are in excellent health.   Some are now producing their
first flower/nut pods.   We are farming the traditional way by
checking every tree daily for unwanted insects and the overall health
of the tree is also checked.   Each tree has its own irrigation sprinkler
which we routinely inspect for blockages every time we irrigate.
Blockages are usually caused by ants entering the sprinklers. We only use a home-made organic insecticide made from neem leaves which amazingly  gets rid of almost all the crop damaging insects we have. </p>
<p>

<i><div>
<i></i><p><i>Above is an area with about 60 trees planted over a year ago.  We have over 400 trees, so you can see the vast areas of weed/grass cutting that is needed and how far the wheel barrow has to be pushed.   The trees above are now more than two to three times the height shown and should start to produce by the end of the year.   We have installed a full irrigation system delivering water to each tree.   Beneath the ground is a vast aquifer so we never run out of water.</i><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461784843/IMG_1761-2_jtwhxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 430.941px;height: 324px;""/></p>Here I am using the bush cutter on 3 - 4 weeks of weed growth.  As you can see it is relentless and I have over six acres to keep clear.</div>
<br/></i><p>This
daily routine involves a lot of walking which gets tough when I'm
carrying a couple of gardening tools and irrigation spare parts or working with the bush cutter. The
trees are planted 5 meters (16 feet) apart and in between them grow
weeds and grass which has to be constantly cut to keep them under
control.    In the tropics there is no winter season when it comes to weed growth, they continually grow . Currently, I spend almost half of every day
cutting and clearing this growth with a bush cutter.    It
is extremely hard work in the heat here which is a constant 33°C
( 91° F) with the humidity running at 80%.  All our work is out in the open.  With the weight of the cutter and
the protective clothing to keep the sun off my skin, I am finding it
overwhelming.  There is no shade to work under and my prosthetic limb certainly does not help matters.  On some days I only manage an hour
or two of work before the aches and discomfort shut me down.  In all we have about six and a half acres that need constant cutting.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461785001/IMG_1759-2_nfrbod.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 300.75px;height: 401px;""/></p>
<p>Mary
is under equal pressure.    She has to push the wheel
barrow around as this is something I am not able to do because of my
prosthetic leg.  She is normally laden down with sacks of home-made
compost and tools she needs for digging out some of the more stubborn
and deeper rooted weeds.</p>
<p>
A
mini tractor with trailer and exchangeable grass/weed cutter would
speed up this daily work to the extent that I could cut all the grass
and weeds in two days or less, allowing much more time for other jobs that
always need doing on a working organic farm.   The trailer
would remove the burden of wheel barrow pushing by Mary.  There are some which go up quite long and awkward sandy slopes. </p>

<p>
We
currently have 13 mature trees which are producing and we have a
buyer for all the coconuts we can supply, now and in the future.
Instead of using the wheel barrow to transport 10/15 coconuts at the time to
the pick up point, we would be able to move 300/400 coconuts at the time.
 There is also the removal of the cut palm leaves which are very
long and quite heavy.   There could be several hundred leaves to
remove to where we mulch them up as part of  our compost mix.</p>
<p>We are one of the very few farms growing organic coconuts in our area and our produce will bring down the cost greatly to the local people. </p>
<p>
Funds
raised via Indiegogo would go towards the purchase of this vital
piece of equipment for us.  The $20,000 we are asking for would purchase one of these complete machines and get it delivered
to our door.  If we don't make it to $20,000, we will buy the grass cutter option  only,  as that is the biggest job we have.   The video clearly shows an example of what I am up against with a bush cutter it is a year round job.    </p>
<p>
One
important point to mention here is that any motorised machinery, be
it cars, trucks, tractors or mini tractors are much more expensive in
Brazil than the USA or Europe.   Transport costs are prohibitive as can be seen below.    The dollar exchange rate is as of 3rd may 2016.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Delivery  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">tractor &amp; trailer </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">(circa 5 days)</span></p><p></p><table><tbody><tr>

name is Ian Wickison and I live in northern Brazil with my American
wife, Mary. I'm British, 65 years old, and a right leg below knee
amputee.  Although my background covers commercial diving  and
professional photography,   I have been involved with
agriculture on and off for most of my life. 

Our
coconut farm which is on eight acres, was born of the idea to produce organically grown trees
which produce the highly nutritional and healthy coconut water at a price that the local Brazilians can afford.  Also, we wanted to secure a safe wildlife area for the vast variety of species  found here.   We
planted over 400 trees 2 years ago, which are doing extremely
well and are in excellent health.   Some are now producing their
first flower/nut pods.   We are farming the traditional way by
checking every tree daily for unwanted insects and the overall health
of the tree is also checked.   Each tree has its own irrigation sprinkler
which we routinely inspect for blockages every time we irrigate.
Blockages are usually caused by ants entering the sprinklers. We only use a home-made organic insecticide made from neem leaves which amazingly  gets rid of almost all the crop damaging insects we have. 




Above is an area with about 60 trees planted over a year ago.  We have over 400 trees, so you can see the vast areas of weed/grass cutting that is needed and how far the wheel barrow has to be pushed.   The trees above are now more than two to three times the height shown and should start to produce by the end of the year.   We have installed a full irrigation system delivering water to each tree.   Beneath the ground is a vast aquifer so we never run out of water.
Here I am using the bush cutter on 3 - 4 weeks of weed growth.  As you can see it is relentless and I have over six acres to keep clear.
This
daily routine involves a lot of walking which gets tough when I'm
carrying a couple of gardening tools and irrigation spare parts or working with the bush cutter. The
trees are planted 5 meters (16 feet) apart and in between them grow
weeds and grass which has to be constantly cut to keep them under
control.    In the tropics there is no winter season when it comes to weed growth, they continually grow . Currently, I spend almost half of every day
cutting and clearing this growth with a bush cutter.    It
is extremely hard work in the heat here which is a constant 33°C
( 91° F) with the humidity running at 80%.  All our work is out in the open.  With the weight of the cutter and
the protective clothing to keep the sun off my skin, I am finding it
overwhelming.  There is no shade to work under and my prosthetic limb certainly does not help matters.  On some days I only manage an hour
or two of work before the aches and discomfort shut me down.  In all we have about six and a half acres that need constant cutting.


Mary
is under equal pressure.    She has to push the wheel
barrow around as this is something I am not able to do because of my
prosthetic leg.  She is normally laden down with sacks of home-made
compost and tools she needs for digging out some of the more stubborn
and deeper rooted weeds.

A
mini tractor with trailer and exchangeable grass/weed cutter would
speed up this daily work to the extent that I could cut all the grass
and weeds in two days or less, allowing much more time for other jobs that
always need doing on a working organic farm.   The trailer
would remove the burden of wheel barrow pushing by Mary.  There are some which go up quite long and awkward sandy slopes. 






The
above images show clearly the type of machinery we desire.
   The
trailer is removable from the tractor unit and the grass cutter can
be fitted in its place.   The bottom image shows example of grass cutter fitted to tractor unit.

We
currently have 13 mature trees which are producing and we have a
buyer for all the coconuts we can supply, now and in the future.
Instead of using the wheel barrow to transport 10/15 coconuts at the time to
the pick up point, we would be able to move 300/400 coconuts at the time.
 There is also the removal of the cut palm leaves which are very
long and quite heavy.   There could be several hundred leaves to
remove to where we mulch them up as part of  our compost mix.
We are one of the very few farms growing organic coconuts in our area and our produce will bring down the cost greatly to the local people. 

Funds
raised via Indiegogo would go towards the purchase of this vital
piece of equipment for us.  The $20,000 we are asking for would purchase one of these complete machines and get it delivered
to our door.  If we don't make it to $20,000, we will buy the grass cutter option  only,  as that is the biggest job we have.   The video clearly shows an example of what I am up against with a bush cutter it is a year round job.    

One
important point to mention here is that any motorised machinery, be
it cars, trucks, tractors or mini tractors are much more expensive in
Brazil than the USA or Europe.   Transport costs are prohibitive as can be seen below.    The dollar exchange rate is as of 3rd may 2016.Delivery  tractor & trailer (circa 5 days)

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">You will discover why we designed <b>ROOMIE</b>, what makes the <b>Smart Collaboration Assistant</b> so innovative, which user problems we are solving and how big is the market opportunity in front of us.</span></p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ideas and questions are welcome. We value your feedback, so just drop me a note. </span>We invite <b>interested investors</b> to contact us as well. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Thank you in advance for your <b>support </b>and <b>contribution</b>.</span></p></span><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Marc-Alexis Remond</b><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i>- Founder and CEO -</i></span></p><h2>1. The Vision</h2><p>According to Analyst Firm, Frost and Sullivan, meeting participants waste up to <a href=""http://www.channelnomics.com/channelnomics-us/news/2460761/taking-videoconferencing-to-the-next-level#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">20 percent of video meeting time</a> on technical issues around preparation and connectivity. </p><p>So it all started with one idea which was to make team meetings more effective and free of technical headaches. I<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">founded Nuage Solutions earlier this year with the vision to transform the way people work, learn and live.</span></p><p>After months of research, brainstorming and conversations with users, blended with 17 years of experience in unified communication and collaboration solutions, we successfully created the remedy to users' challenges.</p><h2>2. The Problems</h2><p></p><p>Time and productivity are wasted every day because of technical issues or lack of user training. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Here are some of the common problems affecting users when meeting in the conference room:</span></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">a. Cables, adapters and screen resolution: </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Time is wasted because presenters struggle to find the right adapter, connector or cable to display the document on their laptop or simply because they cannot adjust screen resolution or image quality.</span><br/></p><p></p><p><b>b. Laptops for team collaboration</b>:<b> </b>Efficiency is impacted because participants have to use a laptop to attend web and video conferences. People are left with no other choice but to squeeze in front of the webcam and microphone to be heard and seen affecting the virtual meeting experience.</p><p><b>c. Monolithic Collaboration Solutions</b>: Customers are tired of investing and maintaining systems that can only be used for one thing. Too often audio, web and video conferencing solutions are built in silos and are not inter-operable. They are <span style=""background-color: initial;"">difficult to use and expensive to maintain. Hence, adoption is low. </span></p><p><b>d. Unified Communication and Workspace Strategies</b>: Employees are equipped with unified communication applications across all their devices except the one in the conference room. They get frustrated when forced to use yet another system. Time is becoming a rare commodity, so is users’ patience.</p><p><b>e. Social Media Applications</b>: Younger generations love social media and mobile applications. They want to use them at work as well to be as productive as they can be. This is simply how they interact and communicate. Yet, most enterprise vendors do not support consumer and social media applications.</p><p><b>f. Real-time Information Sharing</b>: Companies invest a lot in enterprise applications to access to all kinds of data in real-time using mobile devices, but sharing such data in a team meeting is never easy. Users need to be on the same page or dashboard to review data and make informed decisions.</p><p>In section 7, we describe how ROOMIE solves the problems listed above, but first let's have a look at this disruptive piece of technology. </p><h2>3. The Smart Collaboration Assistant</h2><div><br/></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463583918/ROOMIE_Dual_Screen_Indiegogo_multiPoint_quvgv4.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br/><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>ROOMIE is innovative. </b>The Smart Collaboration Assistant enables teams to wirelessly project and share data from any device; start chat sessions, join audio, web and video conferences as well as access both consumer apps and enterprise <span style=""background-color: initial;"">services. It is platform and service agnostic too! </span></p><p><b>ROOMIE is easy to set up.</b> All you need to do is to place the system on top of a wall-mounted screen. Simply connect the power cord, HDMI and network cables. Then, turn it on by pressing on the power button on the front panel. If your monitor has no speakers, that's OK. ROOMIE has two of them.</p><p><b>ROOMIE is easy to use. </b>To make it very easy to use, we developed an intuitive interface for users to quickly to launch any app or service. That's the ROOMIE Launchpad. It runs on Windows 10 which is an operating system users are familiar with, and offers the required levels of security, management &amp; control. </p><p><b>ROOMIE is a unique</b>. It comes with integrated Full HD camera, noise cancelling microphones and speakers to provide the best virtual meeting experience possible in small and medium-sized meeting rooms. The Pro version comes with a USB speakerphone to place at the center of the table in larger rooms.</p><p><b>ROOMIE is used by everyone. </b>It is used for day-to-day meetings, but also to engage employees live, interview candidates, on-board talents, train staff, treat patients, educate students or even fix technical problems at a distance using high quality audio and video. It is used across all industries and functions.</p><h2>4. The Campaign</h2><p><b>Our strategy is to launch ROOMIE before the end of this year</b>. The first few working prototypes have already been produced and tested. Now, we are ready to take this innovative and disruptive piece of technology to market globally, but we can't do it without devoted backers and supporters like yourself.</p><p><b>Our objective is to raise more than US$200,000 in only 45 days</b>. Without your help, we will never be able to scale up our operations to bring this amazing project to life and make it available to businesses, governments, schools and hospitals worldwide. Please support us and contribute in any way you can.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b>Our plan is to used the funds to build up our operations.</b> The money will be used for production (50%), packaging (2%), warehousing (3%), marketing (30%), shipping (5%) and pilots (5%) and donations (5%). Then, we will be able to supply, support and  service ROOMIE around the globe.</p><p><span style=""font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">5. The Opportunity</span><br/></p><p><b>a. Revenue: </b>According to various industry analyst firms, the global enterprise <a href=""http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/pressrelease/video-conferencing-market.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video conferencing market </a>is expected to reach US$4 billion by 2017 and US$7. 85 Billion by 2023. This is a growing market undergoing a transformation. We will be capturing a piece of the <a href=""https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/09/25/770978/10150609/en/Unified-Communication-Market-Size-Will-Be-Worth-75-81-Billion-By-2020-Grand-View-Research-Inc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unified communication market </a>as well. </p><p><b>b. Trends: </b>Just like any other enterprise software, video conferencing is moving to the Cloud. This is drastic market shift. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Companies are also moving away from monolithic conferencing systems creating a huge opportunity </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">to simplify user access to any application or service.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>c. Rooms: </b>Among the 12.5 million conference rooms in the world today, only 3% are equipped with video conferencing systems due to high equipment costs. The remaining 97% of meeting spaces are equipped with just a display and a telephone. There is a market for </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">cost-effective systems in such rooms.</span></p><p><b>d. Product: </b>We designed ROOMIE knowing where the market is headed and what organizations want. The Smart Collaboration Assistant is both platform and service-agnostic giving people the freedom to choose their preferred equipment vendor or cloud service provider. We made it affordable too!</p><p></p><h2>6. The Differentiation</h2><h2></h2><p><b></b></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Traditional video conferencing systems and boxes are monolithic solutions designed to connect to a particular platform or cloud service (SIP/H323), nothing else. Companies selling web conferencing services, unified communication platforms, social and mobile communication applications do not offer collaboration systems for the conference room. </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ROOMIE is truly a very unique piece of technology. It is all-in-one, yet fully featured. Here are some of the key differentiators compared to what exists in the market today:</span><br/></p><p><b>1. Slick</b>: Unique form factor with integrated Full HD camera, noise cancelling microphones and speakers.</p><p><b>2. Intuitive</b>: User friendly software (ROOMIE Launchpad) to quickly launch or access up to 90 different programs, applications and services.</p><p><b>3. Easy</b>: Just connect to power, screens and network to install. Turn it on. You will be ready to go in few minutes only. </p><p><b>4. Versatile</b>: Perfect for boardrooms, meeting rooms, open and shared workspaces, classrooms, clinics, home and branch offices.</p><p><b>5. Powerful</b>: Collaborate, communicate, connect, stream and learn using any media you can think of (Text, Images, Audio, Web or Video…) </p><p><b>6.

You will discover why we designed ROOMIE, what makes the Smart Collaboration Assistant so innovative, which user problems we are solving and how big is the market opportunity in front of us.Ideas and questions are welcome. We value your feedback, so just drop me a note. We invite interested investors to contact us as well.  
Thank you in advance for your support and contribution.Marc-Alexis Remond- Founder and CEO -1. The VisionAccording to Analyst Firm, Frost and Sullivan, meeting participants waste up to 20 percent of video meeting time on technical issues around preparation and connectivity. So it all started with one idea which was to make team meetings more effective and free of technical headaches. I founded Nuage Solutions earlier this year with the vision to transform the way people work, learn and live.After months of research, brainstorming and conversations with users, blended with 17 years of experience in unified communication and collaboration solutions, we successfully created the remedy to users' challenges.2. The ProblemsTime and productivity are wasted every day because of technical issues or lack of user training. Here are some of the common problems affecting users when meeting in the conference room:a. Cables, adapters and screen resolution: Time is wasted because presenters struggle to find the right adapter, connector or cable to display the document on their laptop or simply because they cannot adjust screen resolution or image quality.b. Laptops for team collaboration: Efficiency is impacted because participants have to use a laptop to attend web and video conferences. People are left with no other choice but to squeeze in front of the webcam and microphone to be heard and seen affecting the virtual meeting experience.c. Monolithic Collaboration Solutions: Customers are tired of investing and maintaining systems that can only be used for one thing. Too often audio, web and video conferencing solutions are built in silos and are not inter-operable. They are difficult to use and expensive to maintain. Hence, adoption is low. d. Unified Communication and Workspace Strategies: Employees are equipped with unified communication applications across all their devices except the one in the conference room. They get frustrated when forced to use yet another system. Time is becoming a rare commodity, so is users’ patience.e. Social Media Applications: Younger generations love social media and mobile applications. They want to use them at work as well to be as productive as they can be. This is simply how they interact and communicate. Yet, most enterprise vendors do not support consumer and social media applications.f. Real-time Information Sharing: Companies invest a lot in enterprise applications to access to all kinds of data in real-time using mobile devices, but sharing such data in a team meeting is never easy. Users need to be on the same page or dashboard to review data and make informed decisions.In section 7, we describe how ROOMIE solves the problems listed above, but first let's have a look at this disruptive piece of technology. 3. The Smart Collaboration AssistantROOMIE is innovative. The Smart Collaboration Assistant enables teams to wirelessly project and share data from any device; start chat sessions, join audio, web and video conferences as well as access both consumer apps and enterprise services. It is platform and service agnostic too! ROOMIE is easy to set up. All you need to do is to place the system on top of a wall-mounted screen. Simply connect the power cord, HDMI and network cables. Then, turn it on by pressing on the power button on the front panel. If your monitor has no speakers, that's OK. ROOMIE has two of them.ROOMIE is easy to use. To make it very easy to use, we developed an intuitive interface for users to quickly to launch any app or service. That's the ROOMIE Launchpad. It runs on Windows 10 which is an operating system users are familiar with, and offers the required levels of security, management & control. ROOMIE is a unique. It comes with integrated Full HD camera, noise cancelling microphones and speakers to provide the best virtual meeting experience possible in small and medium-sized meeting rooms. The Pro version comes with a USB speakerphone to place at the center of the table in larger rooms.ROOMIE is used by everyone. It is used for day-to-day meetings, but also to engage employees live, interview candidates, on-board talents, train staff, treat patients, educate students or even fix technical problems at a distance using high quality audio and video. It is used across all industries and functions.4. The CampaignOur strategy is to launch ROOMIE before the end of this year. The first few working prototypes have already been produced and tested. Now, we are ready to take this innovative and disruptive piece of technology to market globally, but we can't do it without devoted backers and supporters like yourself.Our objective is to raise more than US$200,000 in only 45 days. Without your help, we will never be able to scale up our operations to bring this amazing project to life and make it available to businesses, governments, schools and hospitals worldwide. Please support us and contribute in any way you can.Our plan is to used the funds to build up our operations. The money will be used for production (50%), packaging (2%), warehousing (3%), marketing (30%), shipping (5%) and pilots (5%) and donations (5%). Then, we will be able to supply, support and  service ROOMIE around the globe.5. The Opportunitya. Revenue: According to various industry analyst firms, the global enterprise video conferencing market is expected to reach US$4 billion by 2017 and US$7. 85 Billion by 2023. This is a growing market undergoing a transformation. We will be capturing a piece of the unified communication market as well. b. Trends: Just like any other enterprise software, video conferencing is moving to the Cloud. This is drastic market shift. Companies are also moving away from monolithic conferencing systems creating a huge opportunity to simplify user access to any application or service.c. Rooms: Among the 12.5 million conference rooms in the world today, only 3% are equipped with video conferencing systems due to high equipment costs. The remaining 97% of meeting spaces are equipped with just a display and a telephone. There is a market for cost-effective systems in such rooms.d. Product: We designed ROOMIE knowing where the market is headed and what organizations want. The Smart Collaboration Assistant is both platform and service-agnostic giving people the freedom to choose their preferred equipment vendor or cloud service provider. We made it affordable too!6. The DifferentiationTraditional video conferencing systems and boxes are monolithic solutions designed to connect to a particular platform or cloud service (SIP/H323), nothing else. Companies selling web conferencing services, unified communication platforms, social and mobile communication applications do not offer collaboration systems for the conference room. ROOMIE is truly a very unique piece of technology. It is all-in-one, yet fully featured. Here are some of the key differentiators compared to what exists in the market today:1. Slick: Unique form factor with integrated Full HD camera, noise cancelling microphones and speakers.2. Intuitive: User friendly software (ROOMIE Launchpad) to quickly launch or access up to 90 different programs, applications and services.3. Easy: Just connect to power, screens and network to install. Turn it on. You will be ready to go in few minutes only. 4. Versatile: Perfect for boardrooms, meeting rooms, open and shared workspaces, classrooms, clinics, home and branch offices.5. Powerful: Collaborate, communicate, connect, stream and learn using any media you can think of (Text, Images, Audio, Web or Video…) 6. Agile:  Connect to any communication platform, conferencing infrastructure, cloud service, and supported mobile and social applications.7. Social: Enjoy consumer apps such as Skype, WeChat, QQ, Line Facebook Messenger as well as Enterprise Social Platforms like Jive, Yammer...8. Secure: Based on Widows 10 Pro (ROOMIE Pro Version) for improved security, control, management and maintenance at a distance.7. The SolutionWe are determined to transform the enterprise collaboration market and reshape work spaces. Here is how ROOMIE improves the way people...COLLABORATE.ROOMIE enables users to share and edit data wirelessly.  97% of users go to a meeting room to share data using a single laptop but they struggle with various cables and screen resolutions. With ROOMIE, team members can wirelessly project their screen on the monitor in the conference room from any device using any operating system. They can even use the digital whiteboard or open, edit and save documents from their preferred cloud-storage provider.CONFERENCE.ROOMIE improves the group conferencing experience. 68% of users attend a web conference from a meeting room using their laptop which was not designed for group collaboration. 30% of them join a video conference using a specialist device not able to connect to other services.

<br/>
<b><i>Greetings!
Thank you very much for popping in here, to learn about West Indies Soul Food;
what we’re up to; and where we are going {perhaps with your help - God willing}.</i></b>
</p>
<p>West Indies Soul Food, a food-service/catering business, was
launched in 1995, by the company’s Founder and Head Chef, Sharon Richards Noel
(that’s me). The abbreviated version of our history goes like this: I was born
and raised in the Caribbean and upon moving to Minnesota as an adult, in 1981, I
was appalled to find very few suitable dining options that offered great taste
at a fair price. That inspired me to embark on what became a life-long mission
to share my healthy &amp; delicious, Caribbean-style cuisine with as many
people as I can reach. </p>
<p>Two restaurants, an award winning food truck, a successful
food booth at the Minnesota State Fair, countless catering contracts, and 25 + years later … Here I am; <b>still loving
what I do and looking to expand further</b>, into a market that is very near
and dear to my heart; one that serves the inner-city community much more so
than my bank account.  </p>
<p>Already in practice for nearly a year at the non-profit High
School for Recording Arts in St. Paul, my <b><u>Catered
School Food</u></b> model has already generated quite the “buzz” and other
schools are now calling to ask if I will do the same for them, which is where my
need for funding comes into the picture … 
</p>
<p>I have <i>almost</i> all
that I need to expand this proven and highly complimented concept: the kitchen,
staff, equipment, decades of experience, and <b>crazy-good</b> cooking skills; even one immediate, new school contract
is lined up and another is pending<b>! <i><u>What I do not have</u></i><u> is a
vehicle in which to deliver the food to the schools that are requesting our
services</u></b> (just a tiny glitch, right?) </p>
<p><b>My passion for this
project runs deep, but sadly, my pocket book does not. I cannot realize my
vision alone - and humbly ask for your help, in the form of funding
contributions to this project that will put smiles on the faces of so many
appreciative youngsters</b>. </p>
<p>The Thank You’ s and hugs and gushing words of appreciation
I receive from these students every single day is enough to make my 3:00 am
wake-up call well worth the effort. Why are they so appreciative? Because,
while these kids are in need of many things, the most important and basic of
all is their need for good, healthy meals and adequate nutrition. When they
show up for school in the morning, with their stomachs growling because they
had no dinner the night before, I feel like I am doing God’s work, when I can
at least offer them a warm breakfast to start the day off right. </p>
<p>But West Indies Soul Food delivers more than just tasty,
healthy, nutrition. We take care to make sure these children are getting a <u>variety</u>
(very important) of healthy options, cooked with love and served up with
care.  Yes, most standard school-lunch
programs “technically” meet the required <u>minimum</u> nutrition standards,
but how many days in a row would <i>you</i>
be willing to eat a few carrot or celery sticks and call it good?</p>
<p>You might be thinking …“<i>Huh?
<b>my</b> <b>school</b> never served us catered food</i>!”  Well – times, they are a’changin’ and for
many of today’s charter and private schools, catering is a more economical
option for them than hiring food service staff; not to mention purchasing and
maintaining equipment, etc.  That’s what
you call a true Win-Win! </p>
<p>Actually, it would be more accurate to say
“win-win-win-win-win-win” (<b>WIN x 6</b>)!
The school, the kids, their parents, the teachers, the community ... and of
course, our company, are <b><i>all</i></b> winners when these kids are
getting the nourishment they need – both body and mind.</p>
<p>Your generosity will bring more jobs to the community as
well. For each new school contract we secure, we will need to hire another 2
employees. I work with the Goodwill Easter Seals program to provide jobs to
people who are a bit down on their luck and just need a new opportunity to get
things back on track again. </p>
<p><b>Will you join us in
this mission to change these inner-city kids’ school food experience and help
us to bring affordable, healthy <i><u>and</u></i>
delicious options directly to them? </b></p>
<p>With more than 30+ years of experience cooking and serving
fantastically-delicious Caribbean cuisine, West Indies Soul Food will make you
proud to be a participant. With your gracious support we can get this important
project <b><u>out on the road</u></b>
together!</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time – and potentially, for
your much-needed assistance. <br/>
Please contact me, at your convenience, for additional details and information.<b>  </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>If you choose to participate, I will be forever grateful for

Sharon Richardson-Noel</p></div>","Dear Potential West Indies Soul Food Funders: 

Greetings!
Thank you very much for popping in here, to learn about West Indies Soul Food;
what we’re up to; and where we are going {perhaps with your help - God willing}.

West Indies Soul Food, a food-service/catering business, was
launched in 1995, by the company’s Founder and Head Chef, Sharon Richards Noel
(that’s me). The abbreviated version of our history goes like this: I was born
and raised in the Caribbean and upon moving to Minnesota as an adult, in 1981, I
was appalled to find very few suitable dining options that offered great taste
at a fair price. That inspired me to embark on what became a life-long mission
to share my healthy & delicious, Caribbean-style cuisine with as many
people as I can reach. 
Two restaurants, an award winning food truck, a successful
food booth at the Minnesota State Fair, countless catering contracts, and 25 + years later … Here I am; still loving
what I do and looking to expand further, into a market that is very near
and dear to my heart; one that serves the inner-city community much more so
than my bank account.  
Already in practice for nearly a year at the non-profit High
School for Recording Arts in St. Paul, my Catered
School Food model has already generated quite the “buzz” and other
schools are now calling to ask if I will do the same for them, which is where my
need for funding comes into the picture … 

I have almost all
that I need to expand this proven and highly complimented concept: the kitchen,
staff, equipment, decades of experience, and crazy-good cooking skills; even one immediate, new school contract
is lined up and another is pending! What I do not have is a
vehicle in which to deliver the food to the schools that are requesting our
services (just a tiny glitch, right?) 
My passion for this
project runs deep, but sadly, my pocket book does not. I cannot realize my
vision alone - and humbly ask for your help, in the form of funding
contributions to this project that will put smiles on the faces of so many
appreciative youngsters. 
The Thank You’ s and hugs and gushing words of appreciation
I receive from these students every single day is enough to make my 3:00 am
wake-up call well worth the effort. Why are they so appreciative? Because,
while these kids are in need of many things, the most important and basic of
all is their need for good, healthy meals and adequate nutrition. When they
show up for school in the morning, with their stomachs growling because they
had no dinner the night before, I feel like I am doing God’s work, when I can
at least offer them a warm breakfast to start the day off right. 
But West Indies Soul Food delivers more than just tasty,
healthy, nutrition. We take care to make sure these children are getting a variety
(very important) of healthy options, cooked with love and served up with
care.  Yes, most standard school-lunch
programs “technically” meet the required minimum nutrition standards,
but how many days in a row would you
be willing to eat a few carrot or celery sticks and call it good?
You might be thinking …“Huh?
my school never served us catered food!”  Well – times, they are a’changin’ and for
many of today’s charter and private schools, catering is a more economical
option for them than hiring food service staff; not to mention purchasing and
maintaining equipment, etc.  That’s what
you call a true Win-Win! 
Actually, it would be more accurate to say
“win-win-win-win-win-win” (WIN x 6)!
The school, the kids, their parents, the teachers, the community ... and of
course, our company, are all winners when these kids are
getting the nourishment they need – both body and mind.
Your generosity will bring more jobs to the community as
well. For each new school contract we secure, we will need to hire another 2
employees. I work with the Goodwill Easter Seals program to provide jobs to
people who are a bit down on their luck and just need a new opportunity to get
things back on track again. 
Will you join us in
this mission to change these inner-city kids’ school food experience and help
us to bring affordable, healthy and
delicious options directly to them? 
With more than 30+ years of experience cooking and serving
fantastically-delicious Caribbean cuisine, West Indies Soul Food will make you
proud to be a participant. With your gracious support we can get this important
project out on the road
together!
Thank you very much for your time – and potentially, for
your much-needed assistance. 
Please contact me, at your convenience, for additional details and information.  

If you choose to participate, I will be forever grateful for
your kindness and generosity. But in case that’s not quite enough, a complimentary gift basket - including
our *signature sauces, a certificate for *20% off West Indies Soul’s professional
catering services, and a *50% off one-time purchase at our MN State Fair food
booth (Summer 2016) - is our heartfelt THANK
YOU to all supporters who are able to give $1000.00 or more.

For LifeSo what makes a great social life?  Amazing activities; a wonderful group of friends to do them with; maybe a special someone to accompany you and go home with afterwards.  That shouldn't be that hard.  But we all know it is.At Adventures in Common, our members get to choose from 50-100 events every month.  No matter what they like to do, we do it.  As our members go on activities, they make friends and meet people to date in the most comfortable and fun way possible: doing activities they love.  After a short-time in our club, our members have a new group of friends and feel a part of a very special community.      What About Dating?I can't tell you how many of my friends complain about the dating sites - how frustrating, time consuming and unfulfilling they are.  With Adventures in Common, our members get to know each other slowly and casually in a fun, no-pressure environment.  Love blossoms naturally.     Isn't This Just Meetup?Nope! With Meetup, if you want to choose from dozens of different activities each month, you have to join dozens of Meetups.  Some are good.  Some are not so good. There's no consistency in quality.  Our events are all high quality, and hosted by professionals.  At Meetups, you never know how many people will be there or who they are.  At Adventures in Common, you'll see both lots of new faces and also lots of familiar friends as you become part of our community.  How We Make MoneyWe think having a great social life should not only be easy, but inexpensive as well.   At Adventures in Common, we charge less than $2 a day, and you can join for a month at a time with no commitment.  Of course, our members have to pay for some of the events as well, but we never charge more than they would pay if they did the activity on their own.  Plus, we give our members a variety of exciting events no matter what their budget, from bare bones to luxury.  Whether you join us for free events like games nights and hikes, or for luxury trips around the world, you know you'll have the time of your life.  There's another adventures club in the Bay Area.  You might have heard their radio ads.  They charge $2500 upfront to join, plus paying for all the events.  We thought there was a better way. National and International ExpansionWe're opening our first two locations in the San Francisco Bay Area in early 2017. Then as those flourish, we are expanding across the US and into Europe.  Expect us to be in every major US city in 5 years. Changing People's LivesAbout 20 years ago, I started a smaller club which was the predecessor to Adventures in Common.  We had over 100 marriages and hundreds of lifelong friendships.  It was so fulfilling to see people really connecting and looking forward to our activities.  I can't wait to do it again!Management TeamIn case you're wondering if we're just a bunch of travel bum types and might not make this a successful business, we're actually successful business people.  I've got an MBA from Dartmouth and have 30 years of marketing experience.  On my board is the former consulting CFO for Lyft, a lawyer of 23 years, a financial analyst, and a serial entrepreneur who is the founder of an $60M online dating company.  We take fun seriously!  How We'll Use Your ContributionYour contribution will be used to develop our app, for a marketing blitz to launch our company, and to pay our employees until our number of members grows high enough so revenues exceed costs, (projected to be at month 12). Risks and ChallengesOur biggest challenge is getting started and having enough people to get to critical mass.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our brewery here in central Alberta was started with a core ideal—to make the best beer possible. With the support of all of you we've had a fantastic first year doing just that and hope to continue that in years to come. To do so, we've found two Cognac foeders that we want to bring back to the brewery.</p>
<p>These foeders will open up a wide array of beer possibilities for us and we're very excited for them. Your help is truly appreciated in allowing us to continue to experiment and offer new, exciting beers for you to share with us.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need two foeders, not just one. The ability to blend and stagger brews is important because the beer will be in these foeders for months and years at a time.</p>
<p>And shipping big oak tanks out of France is not the cheapest thing in the world.</p>
<p>So, we need the 20 thousand dollars to order the 2x 30 hL (hectoliter, 1 hL = 100 L) foeders and ship them here. (i.e. $5538 USD/per plus ~$4000USD for shipping)</p>
<p>Being previously filled with Cognac we are excited and hope that we can extract some of the delicious Cognac-ness and impart it into the first beers we run through the foeders. There is a wealth of beer styles that we are able to put into these vessels and our eyes are wide with the possibilities.</p>
<p>And that is what we are offering to you, the opportunity to receive the first two commerical batches (one from each foeder) that we rack into these—the new centrepieces of our brewery. If the Cognac character is present in the oak these are the two and only two beers* that will have it.</p>
<p>*as per indiegogo and AGLC rules, we are offering vouchers that will be exchanged for the aforementioned beer at the brewery in Lacombe for off-premise consumption*</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we've been able to handle the challenges that have presented themselves to us thus far, this foeder adventure is a new test.</p>
<p>There are two main risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>A loss in shipping. Unlikely but possible, insurance will be in place to cover a loss there.</li>
<li>Quality of the foeders. We have never set eyes on these so are trusting our broker to ensure that the condition of these is perfect. To alleviate this risk, we have arranged for a cooper (barrel maker) to fly to France and make any repairs that are necessary.</li>

<p>3. Mass production samples will begin, first shot samples will be provided to me to ensure that the product is correct and free of errors and making sure that the quality is at its optimum stage. The lead time for this process is 7 days.</p>
<p>4. After the approval has been given by me, production will start, and the lead time for this is 10 days</p>
<p>5. Once production ends the shipping process will begin from China to the USA and the lead time is 15-25 days</p>
<p>6. Once the goods are in my procession, the delivery process to my backers will begin..</p>

<ul>
<li>The
CYCLONISOR™ softens water without the use of chemicals.</li>
<li>The
CYCLONISOR™ is an effective pre-treatment for Reverse Osmosis units.</li>
<li>This
means that you can bath and shower in water free from chemicals, particularly
chlorine which has now been published to be damaging to health.</li>
<li>When
compressed air is introduced into the CYCLONISOR™ it increases the oxygenation
of the water.</li>
<li>For
Industrial machines and air conditioners the CYCLONISOR™ removes Boiler Scale
(CaCO3) that clogs pipes and pumps.  </li>
<li>Dairy
Cows drinking water that is run through a CYCLONISOR™ provides Oxygen enriched
soft water which gives a major increase of Milk and Cream.</li>
<li>The
CYCLONISOR™ eliminates most maintenance for Desalinators on Cruisers and
Trawlers, and provides constant Pristine Oxygenated water from sea water.</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b>THE AMAZING CYCLONISOR</b></p><p>Over the last twelve years we have been developing our system of mini cyclones in  cylinders.  It has had many rebirths and improvements, but now has the ability to carry out all the applications that we record below.</p><p>With the help of generous friends we have developed our system to the stage where we will have 330 completed Cyclonisors available in  mid July.  Our units are being built in a factory in Zhongshan, which is owned by an Australian, Kaz Bialecki, (to see, scroll to the end of the script).  With the $60,000 that we are seeking we will be able to buy additional tooling to speed up production starting with the next 1000 cyclonisors with  larger production numbers to serve  markets where freshwater is lacking.  It will also allow us to to set up the team to be available to follow through with the first round of installations.<br/></p><p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CYCLONISOR AND WHAT IT DOES</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434333038/jygoocvtxfinwo8sovdt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432965131/faltfmn5nrbum5pa2eaj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><a href=""https://mega.co.nz/#%21bQohDCiL%21nCezoge003kbVuLn98-oYthHIJHJrM_4mQlfE6-Ue20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://mega.co.nz/#%21bQohDCiL%21nCezoge003kbVuLn98-oYthHIJHJrM_4mQlfE6-Ue20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here</a> to print out the booklet for the Installation Instructions.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>CONTINUALLY REPLENISHED FRESHWATER <br/></b>Using natural principles of Cyclones in cylinders and also the effect of water flowing over rapids in mountain streams, water can be replenished as shown here.<b><br/></b><div>

<b>THE WATER CYCLE</b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434333687/p4rbmxmajxvvdwqqccds.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The above diagram illustrates the Water Cycle which takes freshwater from the oceans by cyclones and wind turbulence which then falls as rain.  The  CYCLONISOR™ simulates  functions of the Water Cycle and also flowing mountain streams.  We 
registered the name CYCLONISOR™ that is used in our amazing systems.<br/><br/>By generating mini cyclones in the 3 cylinders in a case, the forces observed in cyclones that both fly outwards and inwards in the cylinders actually tear water molecules apart to produce Hydrogen, Oxygen and OH ions as well as H202 (Hydrogen Peroxide).  This eliminates bacteria and viruses and revitalizes water.<br/><br/><b>Drought Relief</b><br/>We can provide freshwater in droughts for country
 homes in Australia and now America.  We have found that the action of Cyclones taking 
up fresh water out of sea water, is simulated with the CYCLONISOR™ in line with a Reverse Osmosis unit when treating effluent from the outlet of 
septic tanks, so that freshwater can be supplied like what happens in Nature.    It means it is now possible to shower as often as you like and bath as often as you like, without using up your supply of freshwater.<br/><br/><b>Mini Cyclones in the CYCLONISOR™ Gather H2O Molecules</b><br/>From noting the five or so cyclones each year off the coast of Queensland, Australia, we observed most of them formed rain depressions that can provide some 40 million tons or more of rain on the coast.  Cyclonisors apply principles of  cyclones over the oceans that only suck up Hydrogen and Oxygen molecules to form pure water. <br/><br/><b>The CYCLONISOR™ Harnesses Natures Forces</b><br/>From Google noting Cyclones produce Centrifugal and also Centripetal forces, which are the forces simultaneously flying outwards and inwards, in opposite directions.   You see the evidence of massive forces in Twisters.  In our cylinders the  Centrifugal forces cannot fly out as they do in the atmosphere, and are compounded against the inside wall of the cylinders.  So the two opposing lines of forces form an Interface that tears the water molecules apart, and produces Hydrogen and Oxygen ions and also H2O2, which are hostile to bacteria and viruses.  <br/><br/>Over a ten year period we found that we could treat water and eliminate Legionella and other micro organisms without filters or chemicals.  <br/><br/><b>Mitsubishi PLC Units Monitor &amp; Record CYCLONISOR™ Purity</b><br/>We use Bluetooth controls and with sensors incorporated will monitor home water purity  that can be recorded on the home computer or cell phone.  This is Good News for the growing concern by more and more people who do not want chemicals and herbicides in their house water.<br/><br/>Because there are no moving parts in the Cyclonisors they  will not wear out with ten or more years of constant use.<br/>  <br/><b>Our Cyclonisors have High Quality Manufacture</b><br/>It has taken over ten years of research to produce the CYCLONISOR™ that we have today.  We have established dies and production with our associate, and Team member Kaz Bialecki, at his Prestige factory complex in Zhongshan in China.<br/><br/>The target for our Indiegogo campaign is for $60,000 to install initial CYCLONISOR™ units, and we now have at least 10 specific CYCLONISOR™ applications, some of which need a Reverse Osmosis unit and some which do not.<br/><br/><b>Cyclonisors are Supplied Direct to You</b><br/>Because we will supply direct to Householders our Early Bird Contributors can have attractive Perks for those who contribute what ever they can to our amazing project which truly provides <b>""Worldwide Water Solutions for the 21st Century"".</b>  The demand for the Cyclonisors that provide drought relief will grow rapidly.<br/><br/><b>Please Check the Numerous Benefits of our Cyclonisors</b><br/>It is our belief that by  supplying  the Cyclonisors direct to home owners we can support co-operative groups communicating with Indiegogo Contributors for directly providing freshwater with Cyclonisors.   Because of the serious droughts in America,  homes without water need to have priority.<br/><br/><b>THE CHLORINE ELIMINATION UNIT FOR THE WHOLE OF HOUSE<br/><br/></b><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1417025/files/20150426164203-Chlorine_Unit.png?1430091723"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This unit does not need a Reverse Osmosis unit.  It is for homes supplied with town water where the house owner wants to eliminate Chlorine and other chemicals from all the water for the Bathroom, Kitchen and Laundry in the house.  <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F127458356&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F127458356&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F518247371_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><b>Here</b> <b>is Dr Robyn Trompf MD, explaining how happy she is with her Cyclonisor Unit for getting rid of Chlorine</b><br/><br/>You order the CYCLONISOR™ as a Perk for the Chlorine Elimination Unit for the Whole House.<br/><br/><b>·   Mitsubishi PLC/ CEU supplied direct as a Perk</b><br/> <br/>You will need to order the following equipment which is not supplied by us.<br/><br/>

<br/><b>The CYCLONISOR™ Softens Reverse Osmosis Feed Water</b><br/>Freshwater from  Reverse Osmosis units  are 
Approved by Governments and Councils all around the World to supply water for homes.  Reverse Osmosis was developed 50 years ago and has been in use for providing Freshwater from sewage water on Space Stations for decades.  Specifications of the Reverse Osmosis you select can be checked by your local County.  Currently, in growing numbers of Countries,  Reverse Osmosis units supply 
some 12 Billion gallons of Fresh water  daily for  house water Mains, 
with fresh water above the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for 
purity .  The Reverse Osmosis units we specify for our Whole of House 
Unit have to meet the International Standard ISO 9001 Bureau Vertias 
Certification as well as ISO 14001 UKAS Management Systems.   Our 
Mitsubishi Melsec Modules, that meet the above noted specifications, control the CYCLONISOR™ and Reverse Osmosis 
functions and can monitor the water quality supplied to each house.  
With Bluetooth, the water quality can be recorded daily on your home 
computer or your Cell phone.  <br/><br/><b>Amazing Benefits of the CYCLONISOR™ with Reverse Osmosis</b><br/>For a new house with a septic tank, the Whole of House Unit uses a CYCLONISOR™  that pre-treats septic tank effluent, and can also pre-treat water from the sea ; rivers; creeks; bores  or dams.  So, for the new house, you can initially fill the septic tank with any water so that the Reverse Osmosis Unit will provide freshwater for the  Main storage tank for the house.  Once the house is operating, with the Main Freshwater Tank  filled and the septic tank working, the drainage from the Bathroom; Kitchen and Laundry, fills the  effluent water tank that will be purified by the Reverse Osmosis.  The effluent is Pre-treated by the CYCLONISOR™ and from the Reverse Osmosis freshwater is pumped to the Main Tank for the house water supply.  <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F127703588&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F127703588&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F518570980_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><b>Here is Lavinia Bolton talking about her experiences with the Whole of House Unit which was installed on her house in 2009.</b><br/><br/><b>The CYCLONISOR™ is the Key to Constant Reuse of Freshwater</b> <br/>The Whole of House Unit incorporates the CYCLONISOR™ to pre-treat the  water supply to the Reverse Osmosis unit to reduce the TDS of the effluent from the septic tank and also to eliminate Boiler Scale as part of the Pre-Treatment .  A second CYCLONISOR™ unit with a Mini Air compressor then Oxygenates the purified water from the Reverse Osmosis Unit that flows back to the Main storage tank for the house that also receives rain water and dew from roof guttering.<br/><br/><b>Whole of House Installation Procedure for the CYCLONISOR™</b><br/>Complete Installation with instructions are provided so that the Whole of House water supply system can be assembled and installed by the home owner with a plumber and electrician.  Home owners  in Country areas with the  extended drought, are able to  provide their local Water Authority with the Specifications of the Reverse Osmosis unit that is being used.   The CYCLONISOR™ Pre-treated Reverse Osmosis unit has a Bluetooth Mitsubishi Digital Control and Monitoring surveillance system.  The Mitsubishi controls are available as Perks with our Indiegogo  Campaign.  Country Counties with worsening droughts and serious lack of water in Lakes and Aquifers  are able to note the recorded benefits for water purity.<br/><br/><b>Monitored Freshwater Purity with the CYCLONISOR™ System</b><br/>To our knowledge no Water Authorities have regulations for daily monitoring Water purity service for homes using Town water that can have chemical content that may vary from time to time.<br/><br/><b>You will need to order 2  Cyclonisors that you can order as a Perk.<br/>You will also need to order the WHU/PLC as a Perk<br/><br/><b>Note   </b></b>We have programmed the Mitsubishi WHU/PLC for the specific functions you need for the Whole of House Unit (WHU) for Country

The
CYCLONISOR™ softens water without the use of chemicals.
The
CYCLONISOR™ is an effective pre-treatment for Reverse Osmosis units.
This
means that you can bath and shower in water free from chemicals, particularly
chlorine which has now been published to be damaging to health.
When
compressed air is introduced into the CYCLONISOR™ it increases the oxygenation
of the water.
For
Industrial machines and air conditioners the CYCLONISOR™ removes Boiler Scale
(CaCO3) that clogs pipes and pumps.  
Dairy
Cows drinking water that is run through a CYCLONISOR™ provides Oxygen enriched
soft water which gives a major increase of Milk and Cream.
The
CYCLONISOR™ eliminates most maintenance for Desalinators on Cruisers and
Trawlers, and provides constant Pristine Oxygenated water from sea water.

THE AMAZING CYCLONISOROver the last twelve years we have been developing our system of mini cyclones in  cylinders.  It has had many rebirths and improvements, but now has the ability to carry out all the applications that we record below.With the help of generous friends we have developed our system to the stage where we will have 330 completed Cyclonisors available in  mid July.  Our units are being built in a factory in Zhongshan, which is owned by an Australian, Kaz Bialecki, (to see, scroll to the end of the script).  With the $60,000 that we are seeking we will be able to buy additional tooling to speed up production starting with the next 1000 cyclonisors with  larger production numbers to serve  markets where freshwater is lacking.  It will also allow us to to set up the team to be available to follow through with the first round of installations.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CYCLONISOR AND WHAT IT DOESClick here to print out the booklet for the Installation Instructions.CONTINUALLY REPLENISHED FRESHWATER Using natural principles of Cyclones in cylinders and also the effect of water flowing over rapids in mountain streams, water can be replenished as shown here.
The appearance of WATERMILK™ is seen to develop  in the video, after the water has churned through the 3 cylinders of the CYCLONISOR™.  It simulates water flowing down a mountain stream, and you will see the turbidity is most pronounced in the video above in the 3rd Cylinder, which gives the appearance of milk.............so  we named it WATERMILK™.

NASA has shown  that the drought in California is now listed as a MEGADROUGHT across America.  Our Crisis Unit can solve many of the problems.  God willing....... we can make a real difference with the help of  our Indiegogo Contributors and are truly thankful to all those who would like to share with us for our Freshwater Project Worldwide.OUR TEAM IS ESTABLISHING CYCLOWATER™ DAY WORKSHOPSBecause of the DROUGHT CRISIS Cyclowater Global is establishing Day Workshops  organized through our Team members to provide detailed Installation and Maintenance instruction from our Cyclowater accredited Engineers for home owners and technicians.
THE CRISIS UNIT
The Compact CYCLONISOR™ Crisis Unit  This is our Crisis unit.   The CYCLONISOR™  reduces the power required to provide freshwater from sea water by 50% and pre-treats  the inflow of water to the Reverse Osmosis unit   .  The CYCLONISOR™ is a breakthrough that actually gets rid of Boiler Scale which is a main cause of failure for Reverse Osmosis units.  Crisis Units consist of the CYCLONISOR™ and a Reverse Osmosis unit on a Pallet that can supply 1000 gallons per day of fresh water.  Charities and NGO organizations can have the Crisis Unit made up in a security cabinet able to be air dropped for 
Tsunami and Earthquake survivors.  Water that is contaminated from 
creeks, bores or the ocean, is able to be purified with the
 CYCLONISOR™ Crisis Unit.  It needs on site power provided by a generator
 or solar power.  In Disadvantaged countries there is a great need 
for the Crisis Unit for bores that have become contaminated.We supply the CYCLONISOR™  as a Perk.  We do not supply the Reverse Osmosis Unit and Pumps with the necessary security cabinet.The Crisis Unit can supply disadvantaged countries with clean drinking water at minimal cost, and it will supply constant fresh water for 
Tsunami and Earthquake survivors. Our Certificate of AppreciationHere is the Certificate that we have designed.  If you wish to donate, but you do not wish to purchase any of the Perks, then you can print out this Certificate and add you name to it in the appropriate place and also the amount of your donation.

THE WATER CYCLEThe above diagram illustrates the Water Cycle which takes freshwater from the oceans by cyclones and wind turbulence which then falls as rain.  The  CYCLONISOR™ simulates  functions of the Water Cycle and also flowing mountain streams.  We 
registered the name CYCLONISOR™ that is used in our amazing systems.By generating mini cyclones in the 3 cylinders in a case, the forces observed in cyclones that both fly outwards and inwards in the cylinders actually tear water molecules apart to produce Hydrogen, Oxygen and OH ions as well as H202 (Hydrogen Peroxide).  This eliminates bacteria and viruses and revitalizes water.Drought ReliefWe can provide freshwater in droughts for country
 homes in Australia and now America.  We have found that the action of Cyclones taking 
up fresh water out of sea water, is simulated with the CYCLONISOR™ in line with a Reverse Osmosis unit when treating effluent from the outlet of 
septic tanks, so that freshwater can be supplied like what happens in Nature.    It means it is now possible to shower as often as you like and bath as often as you like, without using up your supply of freshwater.Mini Cyclones in the CYCLONISOR™ Gather H2O MoleculesFrom noting the five or so cyclones each year off the coast of Queensland, Australia, we observed most of them formed rain depressions that can provide some 40 million tons or more of rain on the coast.  Cyclonisors apply principles of  cyclones over the oceans that only suck up Hydrogen and Oxygen molecules to form pure water. The CYCLONISOR™ Harnesses Natures ForcesFrom Google noting Cyclones produce Centrifugal and also Centripetal forces, which are the forces simultaneously flying outwards and inwards, in opposite directions.   You see the evidence of massive forces in Twisters.  In our cylinders the  Centrifugal forces cannot fly out as they do in the atmosphere, and are compounded against the inside wall of the cylinders.  So the two opposing lines of forces form an Interface that tears the water molecules apart, and produces Hydrogen and Oxygen ions and also H2O2, which are hostile to bacteria and viruses.  Over a ten year period we found that we could treat water and eliminate Legionella and other micro organisms without filters or chemicals.  Mitsubishi PLC Units Monitor & Record CYCLONISOR™ PurityWe use Bluetooth controls and with sensors incorporated will monitor home water purity  that can be recorded on the home computer or cell phone.  This is Good News for the growing concern by more and more people who do not want chemicals and herbicides in their house water.Because there are no moving parts in the Cyclonisors they  will not wear out with ten or more years of constant use.  Our Cyclonisors have High Quality ManufactureIt has taken over ten years of research to produce the CYCLONISOR™ that we have today.  We have established dies and production with our associate, and Team member Kaz Bialecki, at his Prestige factory complex in Zhongshan in China.The target for our Indiegogo campaign is for $60,000 to install initial CYCLONISOR™ units, and we now have at least 10 specific CYCLONISOR™ applications, some of which need a Reverse Osmosis unit and some which do not.Cyclonisors are Supplied Direct to YouBecause we will supply direct to Householders our Early Bird Contributors can have attractive Perks for those who contribute what ever they can to our amazing project which truly provides ""Worldwide Water Solutions for the 21st Century"".  The demand for the Cyclonisors that provide drought relief will grow rapidly.Please Check the Numerous Benefits of our CyclonisorsIt is our belief that by  supplying  the Cyclonisors direct to home owners we can support co-operative groups communicating with Indiegogo Contributors for directly providing freshwater with Cyclonisors.   Because of the serious droughts in America,  homes without water need to have priority.THE CHLORINE ELIMINATION UNIT FOR THE WHOLE OF HOUSEThis unit does not need a Reverse Osmosis unit.  It is for homes supplied with town water where the house owner wants to eliminate Chlorine and other chemicals from all the water for the Bathroom, Kitchen and Laundry in the house.  Here is Dr Robyn Trompf MD, explaining how happy she is with her Cyclonisor Unit for getting rid of ChlorineYou order the CYCLONISOR™ as a Perk for the Chlorine Elimination Unit for the Whole House.·   Mitsubishi PLC/ CEU supplied direct as a Perk You will need to order the following equipment which is not supplied by us.

Boiler Scale build up is removed by the CYCLONISOR™  running continuously for 1 or 2 weeks in a small installation and 6 to 8 weeks for larger installations such as with 12 or 15 injection molding machines.  This allows for elimination of the build up of Boiler Scale from all machines and plumbing pipes connected to all the machines.After the initial period of eliminating Boiler Scale a timer can be used to provide a daily work cycle to maintain elimination of Colony Forming Units (CFU).  Regulations require regular 2 or 3 monthly tests for Legionella that is eliminated by the CYCLONISOR™ constantly recycling the Sump water of the Cooling Tower.  With any indication of Algae or a test showing Legionella the duration of the CYCLONISOR™ operation period has to be increased.The CYCLONISOR™ complies with the International regulation AS/NZ366.3:2000 for Non Chemical elimination of Legionella.Compressed Air at 80 psi provides high degree of bacteria control. 
 It is connected to the intake through a ¼ inch tube from an Air 
Compressor or a 80 psi regulator from an available Compressed Air 
circuit.  You will need an Electric Timer for ON and OFF duty Cycles for
 the Air Compressor.
                  LUXURY CRUISERS AND TRAWLERS


Primary targets for ""Low Hanging Fruit"" applications include the CYCLONISOR™ simply connected as pre-treatment for sea water for cruisers and trawlers that already have desalinators. The CYCLONISOR™ eliminates most of the maintenance on desalinators and reduces Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) or the hardness factor of sea water by 70%  (see chart).  This means that the electric power for the pump is substantially reduced, while still providing the same amount of continuous fresh water. 
You order the CYCLONISOR™ as a Perk.You will need to purchase the following equipment, which we do not supply:

computer or your Cell phone.  Amazing Benefits of the CYCLONISOR™ with Reverse OsmosisFor a new house with a septic tank, the Whole of House Unit uses a CYCLONISOR™  that pre-treats septic tank effluent, and can also pre-treat water from the sea ; rivers; creeks; bores  or dams.  So, for the new house, you can initially fill the septic tank with any water so that the Reverse Osmosis Unit will provide freshwater for the  Main storage tank for the house.  Once the house is operating, with the Main Freshwater Tank  filled and the septic tank working, the drainage from the Bathroom; Kitchen and Laundry, fills the  effluent water tank that will be purified by the Reverse Osmosis.  The effluent is Pre-treated by the CYCLONISOR™ and from the Reverse Osmosis freshwater is pumped to the Main Tank for the house water supply.  Here is Lavinia Bolton talking about her experiences with the Whole of House Unit which was installed on her house in 2009.The CYCLONISOR™ is the Key to Constant Reuse of Freshwater The Whole of House Unit incorporates the CYCLONISOR™ to pre-treat the  water supply to the Reverse Osmosis unit to reduce the TDS of the effluent from the septic tank and also to eliminate Boiler Scale as part of the Pre-Treatment .  A second CYCLONISOR™ unit with a Mini Air compressor then Oxygenates the purified water from the Reverse Osmosis Unit that flows back to the Main storage tank for the house that also receives rain water and dew from roof guttering.Whole of House Installation Procedure for the CYCLONISOR™Complete Installation with instructions are provided so that the Whole of House water supply system can be assembled and installed by the home owner with a plumber and electrician.  Home owners  in Country areas with the  extended drought, are able to  provide their local Water Authority with the Specifications of the Reverse Osmosis unit that is being used.   The CYCLONISOR™ Pre-treated Reverse Osmosis unit has a Bluetooth Mitsubishi Digital Control and Monitoring surveillance system.  The Mitsubishi controls are available as Perks with our Indiegogo  Campaign.  Country Counties with worsening droughts and serious lack of water in Lakes and Aquifers  are able to note the recorded benefits for water purity.Monitored Freshwater Purity with the CYCLONISOR™ SystemTo our knowledge no Water Authorities have regulations for daily monitoring Water purity service for homes using Town water that can have chemical content that may vary from time to time.You will need to order 2  Cyclonisors that you can order as a Perk.You will also need to order the WHU/PLC as a PerkNote   We have programmed the Mitsubishi WHU/PLC for the specific functions you need for the Whole of House Unit (WHU) for Country 
homes with a septic tank.  The necessary PLC's  are shipped separately 
from the Cyclonisors.
 You would need to purchase the following equipment which we do not supply.

1 x DAB URINOX 40/50 110v or 240v Pump
1 x DAB URINOX 40/50 110V OR 240V Pump with Tap pressure control

150 or 200 gallon Poly Tank for Freshwater
150 or 200 gallon Black In ground  Poly tank

1 x 20 inch by 4 ½ inch Filter Housing with a 10 micron Filter


1 x 20 inch by 4 ½ inch Filter Housing with a Carbon Filter  


5 x 1 inch 24 volt AC Normally OFF Solenoids






Independent Laboratory ReportChecking the Chart below you can see that the Tap Water is far more polluted with Trihalomethanes (THM) than the Effluent Grey water.  Around the World THM Chlorine compounds are now documented with 75 Scientific papers on Google  as being directly linked with many diseases as noted by Joseph G Hattersley in the Journal of Orthomolecular  Medicine.  Also, The Australian Newspaper on 5th  June 2008 noted a  study by UK and Taiwan scientists over a 2 year period on birth defects linked to Trihalomethanes in Town water, for  396,049 babies .
The Amazing CYCLONISOR™ Closed Loop for Reverse Osmosis Wash WaterThe left over water or ""wash water"" from the Reverse Osmosis unit is fed
 back into the septic tank inlet.  This means that there is no drainage 
problems and the CYCLONISOR™ Pre-treated  Feed water to the Reverse Osmosis unit upgrades the Reject or Wash water, that increases the aerobic bacteria in the septic tank.  The  purified water supplied from the Reverse Osmosis is fed through the  second CYCLONISOR™ with Oxygenation increased by the Mini Air Compressor and revitalized to the level of a flowing mountain stream.   Our Patents and Trade Marks The US Patent Number for the CYCLONISOR™ is US 8,622,225 B2 which was granted on January 8,   2014 with the Title FLUID PURIFICATION USING HYDRAULIC VORTEX SYSTEM.
On 17th July 2014, we also applied for a derivative Provisional Patent entitled:  IMPROVEMENTS IN FLUID PURIFICATION USING HYDRAULIC VORTEX FLUID with the Provisional Patent Application No 2014902753 which covers the specific detail and design of the Cylinders that we have developed to generate the Compound Multiplication of Vortices with major production of Dissolved Oxygen in Fluids.  We are currently preparing the Full Specification for the International Patent Co-operation Treaty Application (PCT) which covers the Patent in all countries in the World Trade Organization for 30 months.
We have Trade Mark Registration for            CYCLONISOR™,     CYCLOWATER™,  and     WATERMILK™
ProductionWe have formed an association with a company who have a factory in Zhongshan , China, Digitek Electronics Technology.  This Company is owned by an Australian from Canberra in Australia, Kaz Bialecki, who has been manufacturing in China for the last 20 years.

</div>
<p>PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Netizens are outraged over the news that a Malaysian chef and his son are being charged with murder after allegedly killing a robber who broke into a house where they were staying.</p>
<p>Chef Mo Yi Hong, 56, and his son Mo Wei Qiang, 28, are facing the death penalty for the alleged murder of Chen Wen Bao in Seremban, Negri Sembilan on Feb 24.</p>
<p>Chen allegedly slashed Mo's wife Guo Shu Lan, a Singaporean, before the family fought back.</p>
<p>Chen was killed in the ensuing scuffle. An accomplice managed to flee the scene.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Facebook users defended the actions of the father and son, claiming that they acted out of self-defence.</p>
<p>""This is absurd! Can someone tell me why is there a trial for this?! So the next time someone comes into my home with a knife, I should just let it be because fighting back may result in his death and hence, mine too, What a lesson,"" said Facebook user Sew Yen Jung Platypus.</p>
<p>Another user Ik CheongLoon commented: ""The family should be allowed to defend themselves after robbers entered their house.""</p>
<p>""Personally, if a person comes into my house illegally with the intention to rob &amp; slashes my family members with a knife, he has given up all his rights,"" said Daniel Wong.</p>
<p>Also sharing the same view, Kelvin Loo Quan Huei posted: ""If a man I don't know enter my house and hurt my loved ones, his actually digging s own grave.""</p>

PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Netizens are outraged over the news that a Malaysian chef and his son are being charged with murder after allegedly killing a robber who broke into a house where they were staying.
Chef Mo Yi Hong, 56, and his son Mo Wei Qiang, 28, are facing the death penalty for the alleged murder of Chen Wen Bao in Seremban, Negri Sembilan on Feb 24.
Chen allegedly slashed Mo's wife Guo Shu Lan, a Singaporean, before the family fought back.
Chen was killed in the ensuing scuffle. An accomplice managed to flee the scene.
On Thursday, Facebook users defended the actions of the father and son, claiming that they acted out of self-defence.
""This is absurd! Can someone tell me why is there a trial for this?! So the next time someone comes into my home with a knife, I should just let it be because fighting back may result in his death and hence, mine too, What a lesson,"" said Facebook user Sew Yen Jung Platypus.
Another user Ik CheongLoon commented: ""The family should be allowed to defend themselves after robbers entered their house.""
""Personally, if a person comes into my house illegally with the intention to rob & slashes my family members with a knife, he has given up all his rights,"" said Daniel Wong.
Also sharing the same view, Kelvin Loo Quan Huei posted: ""If a man I don't know enter my house and hurt my loved ones, his actually digging s own grave.""
Some even joked that robbers should be treated differently from now on.
""Next time when a robber enters your house, please accept him with a warm welcome, nice food. Tell them where you keep all the money,"" commented Alan Boey.
Adibah A Hamid wrote: ""Woh! Cant even defend oneself? There were two robbers what do you expect people to do? Sit still and let them cut us up and hurt our loved ones?""
Ms Guo, who received 25 stitches on her arm, said her husband and son were acting in self-defence.
She also claimed that Chen was conscious when they tied him up, and it was not clear how he died.

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Jim Lee and I am the founder of Zenion Industries, Inc. (est. 1979) located in Northern California.  I am the inventor of many electronic products which have been licensed to other companies in the fields of medicine, air cleaning and industrial controls.  This latest product, the Ion-A-Gro, is one of my most exciting accomplishments.  It will dramatically improve the way we grow our food in a completely natural and organic manner, just as nature intended.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">It has taken us over a dozen years and hundreds of thousands of dollars of our own money to study and develop this innovative product to its current level.  It is now ready to enter its final step into the worldwide marketplace.  It is not without challenges because it is new and not easily understood.  Our sales and production demands have not yet reached quantities sufficient to bring the retail price point down to our target of less than $25.  This is where we need your help.  We must increase awareness of this new product and broadcast the validity of its effectiveness.  While we have received many positive testimonials from actual users, greater exposure is needed to convince our target market of the legitimacy of this technology. More importantly, this technology will help food producers around the world grow crops safely and more efficiently, thus mitigating a growing global food shortage.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Zenion has established a rather unique business model which, we believe, will get us over the final hurdles while simultaneously providing a ""win-win"" scenario for all involved.  Zenion intends to evolve into a ""not-for-profit"" organization which will use net revenue from direct sales to fund charitable distribution of the product to worldwide growers who could not otherwise afford to purchase units. Not to be confused with a ""non-profit"" organization which rely on donations, our organization, <i>Zenion</i>, will use sustainable cash revenues to fund distribution of the product to those most in need.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">This is not a get-rich-quick project; indeed, the net revenues will be re-invested into inventory for distribution primarily into third-world countries.  I am approaching 70 years of age and have been blessed with a long successful career.  I neither require nor desire personal profit from this venture.  I look forward to a comfortable retirement in the not-too-distant future* using accumulated revenue from patent royalties from other products I invented and successfully brought to market.  I have invested large sums of money and thousands of unpaid man hours to bring this wonderful ionic technology to its current level.  Nothing would please me more than to witness its distribution into worldwide applications.  Also, I hope this final product becomes the instrument of  a humanitarian effort embraced by many.</div>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">We want to raise both money and public awareness to make this technology available to literally everyone.  This will involve expensive direct video marketing campaigns and product sample distribution.  We are targeting only $85,000 with this campaign, which will be used to pay for more publicity to increase the momentum we seek.  The research and development is finished, Tooling and manufacturing is in place,  Beta testing has been completed.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">We have set aside a sizable portion of our existing inventory as perks.  The goal is to get these devices into the hands of actual users, whether backyard gardeners or small truck farmers, who will spread the word of their positive experience. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""> </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Even if we do not reach our initial goal, we will have made strides to increase product exposure and public awareness, and chipped away at the most difficult hurdle of all...educating our market!</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">While the beneficial effects of treating plants using increased atmospheric ionization have been studied and validated for decades, only now has it become practical. My patent pending technology uses state-of-the-art electronics and physics to overcome the problems faced by earlier researchers.  It is quite complex and not easily understood by most people and therein lies the challenge. We must first educate and validate our target audience who will become users and buyers. This translates to extremely high customer acquisition cost and long breakout periods.  We must also ramp up sales and production to achieve the optimum end price point.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The primarily solar powered product is designed to deliver many years of continuous use.  Since it has no moving parts and does not require batteries the useful life has more to do with the built in solar panel than anything else.  When the purchase price is divided by many years of use, it becomes quite inexpensive. Communicating and demonstrating this to the potential user is the real challenge.</div>

<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact                <i>""The Greenest of Green""</i>
</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Imagine, if you will, if we could increase crop yields by 30% or more while simultaneously optimizing water use and minimizing infestation by insects. Imagine doing this without chemicals, herbicides, or genetic alterations.  Imagine further, if we can accomplish this with a zero carbon footprint by using solar power only. Well, this product does exactly that!  By safely ionizing the carbon dioxide and oxygen the plant absorbs during photosynthesis, a more efficient metabolic rate is achieved resulting in higher yields.  This whole process occurs within the natural diurnal (daily) cycle plants follow.  Most insects (herbivores) are discouraged from feeding upon treated plants due to the harmless electric field generated during the process.</i></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The poor truck farmer in east Ethiopia will be able to simply hang one of the devices above a group of plants (up to 12 plants), then just go about his normal routine.  Later, he will realize he has a healthier crop producing more fruits or vegetables with less water (more absorption and less loss to evaporation) and fewer insect issues.  He may also experience shorter crop cycle time and less fertilizer demand.  After harvest he will simply wipe clean the solar array on the top of the unit and the pure tungsten emitter on the bottom of the device and be ready to use it again in additional growth cycles year after year.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Yes, it is going to rain and be overcast some days.  Also, prevailing winds are going to blow away the majority of ions the device is producing.  All of these factors have been considered and dealt with in the design of this device.  The waterproof device will shut down in some circumstances then restart when conditions improve. The minimum ion concentration required by most plants have been calculated through years of research; thus, losses due to environmental effects have been factored into the design to insure plants received an <i>average </i>needed concentration through an entire growth cycle<i>.  </i>And NO, the device does not use radioactive isotopes or generate ozone or oxides of nitrogen.  It is completely safe!</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Indoors, the Ion-A-Gro can be operated using grow lights or with an included wall adapter to power the device on a 24/7 basis if desired. The wall adapter uses less than 1/10 of a  watt of energy, making it extremely energy efficient.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">As with any new product or technology, risk and challenges always exist.  We have met most of the challenges and are through the start-up R &amp; D phase and into actual production and distribution.  As required by law, our international patent applications were published in mid-March 2015 which exposed drawings and schematics to possible ""Knock Off"" activity.  This is always a threat as product success evolves.  We doubt possible knock offs will be capable of competing effectively with our offshore pricing, quality control, and unique design. But, if they do, we will have patent protection and brand identity.  Also, as the saying goes, ""Imitation is the highest form of flattery"".  After all, our <b>primary</b> goal is to get this technology into as widespread use as possible, both domestically and in third world countries.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span>The Cannabis connection:  While not our primary focus, it was inevitable that the growers of medical marijuana would gravitate toward this product.  A new L.L.C has been formed and licensed to distribute the product in this emerging industry. We granted them a non-exclusive restricted license for use in only legal medical growing enterprises.  They have their own web site at <a href=""http://www.ionagro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ionagro.com</a>. </span><span> We regard this as a ""means to an end"" in that it generates revenue and increases our production levels, thereby helping to reduce manufacturing costs.  We also have grape growers as well as  groups raising competition orchids and the like purchasing the product from our dealers and our web site. </span><br/>

</div></div>","500 MILLION SMALL FARMS IN AFRICA ALONE!

My name is Jim Lee and I am the founder of Zenion Industries, Inc. (est. 1979) located in Northern California.  I am the inventor of many electronic products which have been licensed to other companies in the fields of medicine, air cleaning and industrial controls.  This latest product, the Ion-A-Gro, is one of my most exciting accomplishments.  It will dramatically improve the way we grow our food in a completely natural and organic manner, just as nature intended.

It has taken us over a dozen years and hundreds of thousands of dollars of our own money to study and develop this innovative product to its current level.  It is now ready to enter its final step into the worldwide marketplace.  It is not without challenges because it is new and not easily understood.  Our sales and production demands have not yet reached quantities sufficient to bring the retail price point down to our target of less than $25.  This is where we need your help.  We must increase awareness of this new product and broadcast the validity of its effectiveness.  While we have received many positive testimonials from actual users, greater exposure is needed to convince our target market of the legitimacy of this technology. More importantly, this technology will help food producers around the world grow crops safely and more efficiently, thus mitigating a growing global food shortage.

Zenion has established a rather unique business model which, we believe, will get us over the final hurdles while simultaneously providing a ""win-win"" scenario for all involved.  Zenion intends to evolve into a ""not-for-profit"" organization which will use net revenue from direct sales to fund charitable distribution of the product to worldwide growers who could not otherwise afford to purchase units. Not to be confused with a ""non-profit"" organization which rely on donations, our organization, Zenion, will use sustainable cash revenues to fund distribution of the product to those most in need.

This is not a get-rich-quick project; indeed, the net revenues will be re-invested into inventory for distribution primarily into third-world countries.  I am approaching 70 years of age and have been blessed with a long successful career.  I neither require nor desire personal profit from this venture.  I look forward to a comfortable retirement in the not-too-distant future* using accumulated revenue from patent royalties from other products I invented and successfully brought to market.  I have invested large sums of money and thousands of unpaid man hours to bring this wonderful ionic technology to its current level.  Nothing would please me more than to witness its distribution into worldwide applications.  Also, I hope this final product becomes the instrument of  a humanitarian effort embraced by many.

_____________________________________________________________________________
  What We Need & What You Get
We want to raise both money and public awareness to make this technology available to literally everyone.  This will involve expensive direct video marketing campaigns and product sample distribution.  We are targeting only $85,000 with this campaign, which will be used to pay for more publicity to increase the momentum we seek.  The research and development is finished, Tooling and manufacturing is in place,  Beta testing has been completed.

We have set aside a sizable portion of our existing inventory as perks.  The goal is to get these devices into the hands of actual users, whether backyard gardeners or small truck farmers, who will spread the word of their positive experience. 
 
Even if we do not reach our initial goal, we will have made strides to increase product exposure and public awareness, and chipped away at the most difficult hurdle of all...educating our market!

While the beneficial effects of treating plants using increased atmospheric ionization have been studied and validated for decades, only now has it become practical. My patent pending technology uses state-of-the-art electronics and physics to overcome the problems faced by earlier researchers.  It is quite complex and not easily understood by most people and therein lies the challenge. We must first educate and validate our target audience who will become users and buyers. This translates to extremely high customer acquisition cost and long breakout periods.  We must also ramp up sales and production to achieve the optimum end price point.

The primarily solar powered product is designed to deliver many years of continuous use.  Since it has no moving parts and does not require batteries the useful life has more to do with the built in solar panel than anything else.  When the purchase price is divided by many years of use, it becomes quite inexpensive. Communicating and demonstrating this to the potential user is the real challenge.
                           
             
A single treated tomato plant on the left    Compare just  one week of produce
    and a  untreated plant on the right                                  out of 11 weeks total
    The Impact                ""The Greenest of Green""

Imagine, if you will, if we could increase crop yields by 30% or more while simultaneously optimizing water use and minimizing infestation by insects. Imagine doing this without chemicals, herbicides, or genetic alterations.  Imagine further, if we can accomplish this with a zero carbon footprint by using solar power only. Well, this product does exactly that!  By safely ionizing the carbon dioxide and oxygen the plant absorbs during photosynthesis, a more efficient metabolic rate is achieved resulting in higher yields.  This whole process occurs within the natural diurnal (daily) cycle plants follow.  Most insects (herbivores) are discouraged from feeding upon treated plants due to the harmless electric field generated during the process.

The poor truck farmer in east Ethiopia will be able to simply hang one of the devices above a group of plants (up to 12 plants), then just go about his normal routine.  Later, he will realize he has a healthier crop producing more fruits or vegetables with less water (more absorption and less loss to evaporation) and fewer insect issues.  He may also experience shorter crop cycle time and less fertilizer demand.  After harvest he will simply wipe clean the solar array on the top of the unit and the pure tungsten emitter on the bottom of the device and be ready to use it again in additional growth cycles year after year.

Yes, it is going to rain and be overcast some days.  Also, prevailing winds are going to blow away the majority of ions the device is producing.  All of these factors have been considered and dealt with in the design of this device.  The waterproof device will shut down in some circumstances then restart when conditions improve. The minimum ion concentration required by most plants have been calculated through years of research; thus, losses due to environmental effects have been factored into the design to insure plants received an average needed concentration through an entire growth cycle.  And NO, the device does not use radioactive isotopes or generate ozone or oxides of nitrogen.  It is completely safe!

Indoors, the Ion-A-Gro can be operated using grow lights or with an included wall adapter to power the device on a 24/7 basis if desired. The wall adapter uses less than 1/10 of a  watt of energy, making it extremely energy efficient.

    Risks & Challenges
As with any new product or technology, risk and challenges always exist.  We have met most of the challenges and are through the start-up R & D phase and into actual production and distribution.  As required by law, our international patent applications were published in mid-March 2015 which exposed drawings and schematics to possible ""Knock Off"" activity.  This is always a threat as product success evolves.  We doubt possible knock offs will be capable of competing effectively with our offshore pricing, quality control, and unique design. But, if they do, we will have patent protection and brand identity.  Also, as the saying goes, ""Imitation is the highest form of flattery"".  After all, our primary goal is to get this technology into as widespread use as possible, both domestically and in third world countries.


The Cannabis connection:  While not our primary focus, it was inevitable that the growers of medical marijuana would gravitate toward this product.  A new L.L.C has been formed and licensed to distribute the product in this emerging industry. We granted them a non-exclusive restricted license for use in only legal medical growing enterprises.  They have their own web site at www.ionagro.com.  We regard this as a ""means to an end"" in that it generates revenue and increases our production levels, thereby helping to reduce manufacturing costs.  We also have grape growers as well as  groups raising competition orchids and the like purchasing the product from our dealers and our web site.

TESTIMONIALS:
""In January we placed an Ion-A-Gro above a very tired looking phalaenops orchid.  Four months later my orchid has doubled its leaf output and has two full spikes of blooms. We can't wait to see what it will do for our 
newly planted tomato plants!""Linda Musick, Retired Teacher,  and   Dr. Roy Musick, M.D. (retired),Santa Rosa, CA______________________________""I bought an Ion-A-Gro recently and hung it above one of my tomato plants and to say the least the results are dramatic!  Thank you for an honestly great product.""Larrry Smith, Railroad Engineer (retired),   Roseburg, OR_____________________________""I could not believe my eyes.  I witnessed the Ion-A-Gro product in a 
separated part of my friend's garden and everything was growing so much 
larger and healthier compared to their untreated plants.""Ben Blom, Landscape Contractor ,  Rohnert Park, CA______________________________""I was rather skeptical at first, but after just a few weeks it was 
obvious the Ion-A-Gro was having a huge effect upon my garden plants.  
Compared to untreated  plants, there was almost a two to one increase in plant size and fruit/produce production. Wow!""B. Blake,  I.R.S. Revenue Officer (retired),   Penngrove, CA 
________________________________
While testing the Ion-A-Gro units for several cycles our yields have been significantly increased.  As well, we have noticed that while mites existed in our facility, they appeared to be significantly reduced in the grow rooms that were utilizing Ion-A-Gro units.  So far there is reason to believe that the units are of profound interest to any grower, hobbyist or commercial enterprise.

•	Pourquoi ce nom ; Institut Cap Démocratie ?Parce que :➢	Les électeurs votent de moins en moins et le grand gagnant des élections est très souvent le taux d’abstention.➢	Les électeurs ont de moins en moins confiance dans leurs politiques.➢	Quand nous votons, nous votons de plus en plus contre quelqu’un ou un projet, alors que nous devrions voter pour quelqu’un ou un projet. Les électeurs doivent savoir pour qui et pour quoi ils votent.➢	Combien d’électeurs connaissent le nom de leur député européen ? de leur sénateur ? de leur conseiller général ? Le lien humain entre les élus et les électeurs est en danger.➢	Combien savent ce que leurs élus font après avoir été élus ? Quelles sont leurs fonctions ? leurs prises de positions ? leurs actions ? leurs votes ?...➢	Les promesses électorales sont trop souvent oubliées une fois l’élection passée et ne reviennent dans les médias qu’aux échéances électorales suivantes.➢	Les liens personnels entre les électeurs et les élus sont trop souvent parasités par les partis politiques et assujettis à des volontés nationales ne rejoignant que très rarement le quotidien des électeurs.➢	La Démocratie est en danger si ces liens ne sont pas rétablis au plus vite !•	Comment agir ? « Car celui-là qui veille modestement quelques moutons sous les étoiles, s’il prend conscience de son rôle, se découvre plus qu’un serviteur. Il est une sentinelle. Et chaque sentinelle est responsable de tout l’Empire. » Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Terre des hommes
« Toute personne a le droit de prendre part à la direction des affaires publiques de son pays, soit directement, soit par l’intermédiaire de représentants librement choisis.» Déclaration Universelle des Droits de l’Homme du 10/12/1948 (art. 21-1)
➢ L'Institut Cap Démocratie est votre outil pour agir et rétablir ce lien démocratique entre électeurs et élus.➢ L'Institut Cap Démocratie veut que la Démocratie ne soit plus un feu de paille électoral mais bien une réalité quotidienne vécue par les électeurs et les élus.➢ L'Institut Cap Démocratie va rassembler sur un même outil, accessible à tous et gratuit, tout ce qui concerne vos élus de façon à ce que vous puissiez non seulement savoir qui ils sont, ce qu’ils font et ce qu’ils disent sans avoir à passer des heures en recherche de ces informations, mais aussi afin que vous puissiez voter en conscience et au plus près de vos convictions. Ne plus voter contre, mais voter pour !➢	Investissez-vous dans l'Institut Cap Démocratie : c’est votre outil, faite-le vivre ! Soyez un acteur de la Démocratie en devenant un relais de l'Institut Cap Démocratie. Pour cela vous pouvez, dès l’ouverture du site :

<h3></h3><h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><p>It's logical for people to have questions. Some people don't understand the technology behind 3D WiFi Bubbles and the solution itself.

This a prerequisite since they don't have the ""3D WiFi Fencing"" technology that encloses a certain space into a bubble and lets only customers to connect. Furthermore, these solutions do not do anything else other than fetching personal data and information from the connected social media accounts for their benefit and the benefit of businesses. 3D WiFi Bubbles on the other hand cares about personal data and takes security very seriously. No personal information is shared for no reason to any business owner or third party tool unless explicitly allowed and confirmed by the user/customer!<br/><br/></p><p><i>Does 3D WiFi Bubbles use GPS or Google location services?</i></p><p>Absolutely not. 3D WiFi Bubbles is a WiFi technology and does not need either GPS or any Google location services to function. After all, GPS is useless indoor and Google location services have near to zero precision in such cases. Furthermore, GPS and all location services drain battery too fast and it was my intention from the very beginning to put them off the way. With 3D  WiFi Bubbles, WiFi is all you need!<br/><br/></p><p><i>Can this solution charge my phone while I am connected?</i></p><p>No. 3D WiFi does not charge your phone. But, it tries to minimize your battery consumption by utilizing smart algorithms that alter your WiFi speed and transmission quality per case. It usually makes a very good job and saves up to 4 hours of battery time. (Depending on your battery capacity, running applications and type of your smart device)<br/><br/></p><p><i>Why, can't anyone else do that or even worse copy that?</i></p><p>3D WiFi Bubbles is currently based on a patented hardware (Raspberry Pi). For testing purposes this is fine but I am planning to create my very own proprietary board. It is true that anyone could get a Raspberry Pi, a WiFi antenna and all the stuff and replicate the hardware. What anyone else couldn't do though, is to replicate or copy the changes I've made in its firmware, some other altered technical details and finally the source code that lies inside it.<br/><br/></p><p><i>Will this device ever hit the market?</i></p><p>Most certainly yes. I already have some good feedback from people around me who seem to be intrigued by what this device can do and how services provided from within it will change the landscape.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p><i>Which underdeveloped countries will be most affected from this invention?</i></p><p>I have conducted a serious research from the tools that I am given by the Rotary International. I found that in Nigeria people suffer most. Especially in Lagos, the obsolete infrastructures (lack of stable electrical network, telecommunications, etc.) and the unstable climate and political environment (gangs, water issues, diseases) push people to the edge.

<p>The reason I started this campaign is because I need you to help me build the final project (hardware and software) so that I can offer quality services to businesses and humanitarian aid in underdeveloped countries.

As sustainable agriculture loving foodies, we see some gaps in the Vermont food system.</b></p>
<p><b>One of these gaps is the lack of locally produced tortillas.   Presently you cannot buy tortillas in Burlington, Vermont at the local markets that are organic.  You cannot buy tortillas at the markets in Vermont  that are produced using local corn.  And you certainly cannot buy tortillas in Vermont that are produced the traditional way through nixtimalization  </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(<a href=""http://decolonizeyourdiet.org/2013/07/making-gmo-free-corn-tortillas-from-scratch-a-detailed-lesson-in-nixtamal-for-beginners.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://decolonizeyourdiet.org/2013/07/making-gm...</a>).</b></p>

<p><b>Tortillas produced through nixtimalization are more nutritious than those found in the supermarket (that are typically produced with masa) and they taste much better.  Therefore, we see an opportunity to create an added value product using organic locally produced corn.    The corn shown in the photo  below is organic dent corn from Maine.  We will source a similar corn from Vermont and neighboring upstate New York, based on availability.  We have already identified two sources for this years production.  In the future we hope to have farmers grow special ancient grain variety of corns for us, but these are presently not possible to find in the quantities needed.  </b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We are April and Azur Moulaert, former vagabonds that ended up in Burlington, Vermont.  We love Vermont.  We are passionate about food.  We are passionate about sustainable agriculture (both of us have our MS degrees in this field).  We have a strong connection to Latin America (Azur is Costa Rican). As sustainable agriculture loving foodies, we see some gaps in the Vermont food system.
One of these gaps is the lack of locally produced tortillas.   Presently you cannot buy tortillas in Burlington, Vermont at the local markets that are organic.  You cannot buy tortillas at the markets in Vermont  that are produced using local corn.  And you certainly cannot buy tortillas in Vermont that are produced the traditional way through nixtimalization  (http://decolonizeyourdiet.org/2013/07/making-gm...).
(http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/make-m...)
Tortillas produced through nixtimalization are more nutritious than those found in the supermarket (that are typically produced with masa) and they taste much better.  Therefore, we see an opportunity to create an added value product using organic locally produced corn.    The corn shown in the photo  below is organic dent corn from Maine.  We will source a similar corn from Vermont and neighboring upstate New York, based on availability.  We have already identified two sources for this years production.  In the future we hope to have farmers grow special ancient grain variety of corns for us, but these are presently not possible to find in the quantities needed.  


With your donation, we can get to where we want and need to be quicker, and we can demonstrate that others share our passion.  If it's a good idea, why not contribute?   What We Need & What You Get We are seeking $30,000 to help us cover about half of  the cost of the equipment that we need to make the tortillas.  The equipment is pricey, but necessary to produce tortillas at the scale we wish to.   The photo below is similar to the the type of equipment we will be buying.  


We are working actively on our business plan. We have visited a business similar to the one we wish to open in Portland, Maine and were inspired and educated by the fabulous Lynn Rowe (http://www.pachangatortillas.com/).  Azur went through the whole production process with her.   We have identified a space and we expect to enter into a lease agreement in the next month or so.
We have the energy, we have the passion, we need YOU!
If we do not reach our goal, we will figure out a way to make this happen.  But we would love to have your help.   The Impact Your contribution will help support farmers in Vermont, will encourage farmers to grow organic corn (few do!), and will taste yummy and make you smile!

<div>
<p>Hi my name is Gromiko Tchanmeni, I am 21 years of
age and I am the CEO of our real estate company located in Cameroon. I work
with my fraternal twin brother Enstein. We are sophomores in college and we
reside in Maryland. Ever since middle school it has been a passion of ours to
not only open a real estate company in Cameroon, but to build a community base
environment to help others feel at home. We have managed to save up enough
money to buy two lands were we can begin to build.</p>
<p>The mission of our campaign is to build
affordable apartments for the masses. Building a community base environment is
our first priority and we strongly believe that real estate will play a big
role in that. Our core values are to establish a community atmosphere, ignite
excitement and to assure low cost of living. This campaign is tremendously
important to us because we sincerely feel that we have an obligation to help
reshape the living conditions back home. Buying our first two land is a
stepping stone towards that direction. </p>
<p>To contribute whether it be money or word of
mouth would be a valuable tool to help us reach our goal. Reaching our goal
will help us complete a four level apartment building that would be sold at a
very low price. Aside from that the money will also be used to build a
recreational park, so kids can have a place to have fun while being monitored
by their family. </p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<div>
<p>We would need $705,500 to help build our four
level apartment building. Before building, there will be a couple of equipment's
we would need. Cement, Iron bars, sand, glass and wood. Iron bars are extremely
important because it will help strengthen and hold concrete in tension. A total
of $12,000 would be needed for that. </p>
<p>1. Foundation would need to be put in place which
would cost $100,000</p>
<p>2. The whole apartment building will have four
levels. Each levels would consist of two apartments. Each apartments will have
two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a living room. 1500 square foot per
apartments. It will cost $55,000 per apartment to have that set up. A total of
$440,000. </p>
<p>3. Solar panels will be set up to bring about
electricity to the building. We love the idea of solar panels because it not
only preserves the environment, it is renewable and cost effective for our
consumers. Our consumers will never have to worry about electricity shortage.
$100,000 would be needed for that. </p>
<p>4. $32,000 will be needed for electric wiring and
plumbing system for the entire building. </p>
<p>5. Because of living conditions, it is sometimes
difficult for people to get access to clean drinkable water. My brother and I
came up with the idea of building an independent water system connected to the
building that will purify the water before it comes in, so people can use it
without getting sick. A cost of $20,000 will be needed for that. </p>
<p>6. We wanted to also build a recreational park
not too far from the building for kids to enjoy themselves <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">while being monitored by their family. A cost of

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><p>My brother and I are excited about this project,
it is a dream that is slowly coming to reality. Our project will provide accessibility
to clean water, a safe environment for children, affordable housing for
families and a cheaper alternative to electricity through the solar panels we
will install. Contributions from others will change the living conditions and
reshape the way people live. Our goal goes beyond the line of just building, it

<p>I am raising funds for horse transportation to a site in East Hampton for S.E.E.R.'s.  ""public intervention"" project summer 2015 ,and also for a mobile outreach throughout Suffolk County,Long Island New York.</p>S.E.E.Rs'   Mission is threefold ;<p></p>
<p>~ To promote the belief that a horse is of value because of its nature ,being or ""Medicine"" as opposed to the popular belief that a horses value is equal to its ability to perform physically</p>
<p>~ To provide a horse experience to people who would benefit from it,but cannot afford it.</p>
<p>~ To give horses in desperate situations a new lease on life</p><p> ****UPDATE ****3/27   The remaining 3 Shires have moved to my barn in Easthampton !!! Feeding them is a massive commitment ! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1331004/files/20150327065649-image.jpg?1427464609"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Although SEER incorporated in 1999, the mission has been my life for over 40 years. I am equally involved with all three aspects.During the 90s' I was moving in the direction of horse rescue,happily many other farms &amp; individuals embraced that. People give me horses with behavior issues and I recycle them,or help privately owned  sport horses transition into pleasure horses when they retire.</p>
<p>I became aware of horse slaughter while attending an auction on Long Island in 1971. My sister and I started "" recycling"" horses soon after,fortunately we had the use of my families farm in Bay Shore at the time.</p>
<p>Riding thru suburbia on my horse in the 70's,I would always stop and let people love up the horse,sometimes even giving rides.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1234113/files/20150219133245-image.jpg?1424381565"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I would ride into the poorest communities,and to downtown Bay Shore where the outpatients of the mental hospitals roamed. Sometimes even on the grounds of Pilgram State  Phychiactric Hospital. Just to cheer people up with my horse.It's  amazing the vast numbers of people who were locked up in these places before A.A. did so much to help people ,and pharmaceuticals gave people the freedom to be responsible for their own sanity ( or lack of).  As a young girl riding past the barred windows, I suspected the population represented a large portion of the avant guard.(My eldest sister who trained for nursing at Kings Park,concurs.) I had compassion for these people because they had no freedom and were powerless.Maybe that's the attraction with horses,freedom and power,in both a physical and other worldly way.<span>Horses empower their riders,and in my case gave me a lot of freedom.I would go on my horse where I would never go alone. I felt a need to share the beauty of the horses with people in need.</span><div>
<p>I still do.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1234122/files/20150219133535-image.jpg?1424381735"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p><br/></p>My horses and I relocated to Long Islands famous beach community ,the Hamptons,in 1987. People from New York City love to escape to the ""country"" here.We have many fine stables,that teach people to ride and compete on performance or sport horses. I worked in sport  horse barns full time from 1983-92, when I opened a boarding stable for pleasure horses in East Hampton. ( Cove hollow Stable 92-2001)<span>While working in the  Riding Academy's ,I </span><span>would always feel kind of sad tacking up (saddling) a horse for new students and seeing how some of them just wanted to love and BE with horses.</span>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1234008/files/20150219124848-image.jpg?1424378928"" src="""" style=""""/></p>However,the precious horse time was to be spent as a""learning"" experience.After a couple weeks it seemed the love of horses paled next to the love of having the teachers attention,and getting egos stroked while dominating a powerful animal. Good stuff right? Builds self esteem. Sports are good for the masses,and many people thrive in this environment. Others kind of shrivel up and drop out.Free thinking, sensitive,artistic people are deprived of what would be a gratifying horse experience,because out here in the suburbs of New York City it's just not available.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1231203/files/20150218093150-image.jpg?1424280710"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>I am raising funds to create a ""public intervention"" or "" installation"" with my horse Tucker as living sculpture. To offer a site where people can freely and safely interact with a free and safe horse.</p>

<p>Tucker 2009 ( recycled 2006,he was unmanageable )</p> <p>I have also had a desire to bring him to schools and teach about pleasure horses,how a relaxed uncomplicated life makes a relaxed uncomplicated SAFE ""pleasure"" horse.I have been <span>invited to create a program for a children's museum.Whats been holding me back is transportation.The $5000. Is a modest amount to lease a truck and horse trailer for six months,and I need to act on it now or risk missing the opportunity.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1234071/files/20150219131434-image.jpg?1424380474"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>

</div></div>","I am raising funds for horse transportation to a site in East Hampton for S.E.E.R.'s.  ""public intervention"" project summer 2015 ,and also for a mobile outreach throughout Suffolk County,Long Island New York.S.E.E.Rs'   Mission is threefold ;
~ To promote the belief that a horse is of value because of its nature ,being or ""Medicine"" as opposed to the popular belief that a horses value is equal to its ability to perform physically
~ To provide a horse experience to people who would benefit from it,but cannot afford it.
~ To give horses in desperate situations a new lease on life ****UPDATE ****3/27   The remaining 3 Shires have moved to my barn in Easthampton !!! Feeding them is a massive commitment ! 
Although SEER incorporated in 1999, the mission has been my life for over 40 years. I am equally involved with all three aspects.During the 90s' I was moving in the direction of horse rescue,happily many other farms & individuals embraced that. People give me horses with behavior issues and I recycle them,or help privately owned  sport horses transition into pleasure horses when they retire.
I became aware of horse slaughter while attending an auction on Long Island in 1971. My sister and I started "" recycling"" horses soon after,fortunately we had the use of my families farm in Bay Shore at the time.
Riding thru suburbia on my horse in the 70's,I would always stop and let people love up the horse,sometimes even giving rides.I would ride into the poorest communities,and to downtown Bay Shore where the outpatients of the mental hospitals roamed. Sometimes even on the grounds of Pilgram State  Phychiactric Hospital. Just to cheer people up with my horse.It's  amazing the vast numbers of people who were locked up in these places before A.A. did so much to help people ,and pharmaceuticals gave people the freedom to be responsible for their own sanity ( or lack of).  As a young girl riding past the barred windows, I suspected the population represented a large portion of the avant guard.(My eldest sister who trained for nursing at Kings Park,concurs.) I had compassion for these people because they had no freedom and were powerless.Maybe that's the attraction with horses,freedom and power,in both a physical and other worldly way.Horses empower their riders,and in my case gave me a lot of freedom.I would go on my horse where I would never go alone. I felt a need to share the beauty of the horses with people in need.
I still do.
 My horses and I relocated to Long Islands famous beach community ,the Hamptons,in 1987. People from New York City love to escape to the ""country"" here.We have many fine stables,that teach people to ride and compete on performance or sport horses. I worked in sport  horse barns full time from 1983-92, when I opened a boarding stable for pleasure horses in East Hampton. ( Cove hollow Stable 92-2001)While working in the  Riding Academy's ,I would always feel kind of sad tacking up (saddling) a horse for new students and seeing how some of them just wanted to love and BE with horses.
However,the precious horse time was to be spent as a""learning"" experience.After a couple weeks it seemed the love of horses paled next to the love of having the teachers attention,and getting egos stroked while dominating a powerful animal. Good stuff right? Builds self esteem. Sports are good for the masses,and many people thrive in this environment. Others kind of shrivel up and drop out.Free thinking, sensitive,artistic people are deprived of what would be a gratifying horse experience,because out here in the suburbs of New York City it's just not available.



I am raising funds to create a ""public intervention"" or "" installation"" with my horse Tucker as living sculpture. To offer a site where people can freely and safely interact with a free and safe horse.
            
Tucker 2009 ( recycled 2006,he was unmanageable ) I have also had a desire to bring him to schools and teach about pleasure horses,how a relaxed uncomplicated life makes a relaxed uncomplicated SAFE ""pleasure"" horse.I have been invited to create a program for a children's museum.Whats been holding me back is transportation.The $5000. Is a modest amount to lease a truck and horse trailer for six months,and I need to act on it now or risk missing the opportunity.



There is another project S.E.E.R.  has been working on,funds in excess of $5000. would go to creating a Sanctuary for four very special horses,that may need to be relocated as soon as 3/17/15. ( I already have one here in East Hampton as of 12/14)

They are a rare breed of draft horse,three of them are mares,one a proven broodmare with very impressive bloodlines.I met their owner in cyberspace almost 2 years ago. The Clydesdale I had owned for 21 years passed away,and I reached out to the local draft horse communityBubbaThe "" people's Horse"" Is Dead  4/17/13.   I first visited this barn 6 /11/13, a week later 5 of the horses were relocated,and shortly after their owner was charged with 5 counts of abuse
                  The above horses were relocated 6/17/13 and have since gained 600lbs 
      She was found guilty and will be sentenced 3/17/15. I have been very interested in what is going on here below the surface,and astonished at how all encompassing it is.Now that the State of New York is involved there will definatly be some big lifestyle changes for her.,and the horses.  We both would like the 4 remaining horses to stay together( a mare and her filly & a brother and sister) being cared for by me and turned out on grass.They came to her barn as yearlings,are untrained,and have never had grass pasture.

In addition to that,many of the interns from our local farming school at Quail Hill are interested in farming with horses and  would love an opportunity to work with draft horses locally instead of traveling to Pennsylvania or New England. 


I became interested in carriage driving as a young girl,and over the years have trained many of my own horses as well as clients' horses to drive.Carriages appealed to me then and now because it's a shared experience.                                                                          
 
The barn behind me houses the Roy Lester Carriage Museum,in Amagansett N.Y.
Two of the carriages are Coaches,yesterday's version of a stretch Hummer &  Bentley.They are designed to be drawn by four horses,and have occasionally appeared in local parades,but not in a long time,Coaching horses are in short supply in The a Hamptons. Back in the 80's I helped a woman I was working for train her horse to pull a carriage for her wedding.

<p>My name is Stan Washington, founder and president of Honor Services Inc. After graduating from University of Illinois, I was recruited to GTE as a programmer of the 911 system. Years later I was recruited to James Martin &amp; Co. where I consulted on business strategy. I was then recruited to McDonald's Corp where I spent the bulk of my tenure. </p>
<p>I became the executive of Operations and Technology, managing technology for 14,000 locations. After surviving many reorganizations and down-down-sizing’s, I chose to become an entrepreneur. With no, plan, no direction, I struck it out on my own and ran into many problems.  It reminded me of my entrepreneur parents.</p>
<p>Six dollars and fifty cents was my allowance when I was in high school. That consisted of fifty cents to go to school, fifty cents to eat lunch and fifty cents to return home for five days. If I lost one quarter I had to miss a meal. This was the plight of my entrepreneur father and many others in my neighborhood who ""had"" to do something because jobs were not accessible. <br/></p>
<p>I partnered with some great people who knew Technology, Marketing and Sales and we are bringing this knowledge to those in need! <b>WYRB</b> will assist us in spreading the word on radio.</p>

<p>We plan to help enthusiastic small business owners who need
Marketing, Sales and Technology resources by supplying vital training to point people
in the right direction, just like I did at McDonald’s corp. </p>
<p>1. We will deliver Sales training for ""Low Cost"" to FREE to those who have
invested $1000 or 1000 hours into their business. We will determine the
validity of the request through an interview. (The entrepreneur must purchase our
sales book and workbook). <b>This needs your financial support!</b></p>
<p>2. We will deliver Marketing training for ""low Cost"" to FREE to those who
qualify, just like those listed above. <b>This takes time and needs your financial
support.</b></p>
<p>3. We will deliver Technology training on our solution. Honor
Services Office is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Invoicing and
Email Marketing tool that is designed to grow as your business grows. <b>We made
this ""low cost"" to FREE to help small businesses get a solid start, but this needs to be
subsidized.</b></p>
<p>4. We developed low cost resources to help the Do-it-Yourself’ers.
Our Peaceful Selling curriculum helps teach new and existing entrepreneurs ways
to grow their business with “sales” techniques. Our Plans to Prosper curriculum
teaches marketing strategies that can be used to grow and expand the business.
Each comes with a book and workbook.</p>
<p>5. We offer services (not for free) to execute the marketing for
small businesses. We help the small business owners with executable marketing

<p>On <b>April 18th, we will start with our first event</b>. “Ways to Empower
My Business” at Chicago State University. We will introduce business owners to
enable connections to be made, discuss our books and do a signing, and get many

<p>This event, and others like it will have a cost. Marketing, locations

their business into the millions. (believe it or not, some McDonald’s fail, so
we will use the “Plan for Success” to help!)</p>
<p>We will execute training in four week waves. With a month off

ends meet. She soon realized she was by herself and had no help. She knew
custom blankets but did not know how to market, sell or manage her business.


This is the plight of many entrepreneurs who “have” to be in
business because they are underemployed or have a business idea and no one to
help. We, “Nerds” put our heads together and developed affordable technology
that is FREE until the small business makes enough money to pay us.
We also developed a Marketing curriculum and a Sales
curriculum that we would like to teach for FREE, but that costs money!



About us
My name is Stan Washington, founder and president of Honor Services Inc. After graduating from University of Illinois, I was recruited to GTE as a programmer of the 911 system. Years later I was recruited to James Martin & Co. where I consulted on business strategy. I was then recruited to McDonald's Corp where I spent the bulk of my tenure. 
I became the executive of Operations and Technology, managing technology for 14,000 locations. After surviving many reorganizations and down-down-sizing’s, I chose to become an entrepreneur. With no, plan, no direction, I struck it out on my own and ran into many problems.  It reminded me of my entrepreneur parents.
Six dollars and fifty cents was my allowance when I was in high school. That consisted of fifty cents to go to school, fifty cents to eat lunch and fifty cents to return home for five days. If I lost one quarter I had to miss a meal. This was the plight of my entrepreneur father and many others in my neighborhood who ""had"" to do something because jobs were not accessible. 
I partnered with some great people who knew Technology, Marketing and Sales and we are bringing this knowledge to those in need! WYRB will assist us in spreading the word on radio.


Here is how YOU can help!
 
We plan to help enthusiastic small business owners who need
Marketing, Sales and Technology resources by supplying vital training to point people
in the right direction, just like I did at McDonald’s corp. 
1. We will deliver Sales training for ""Low Cost"" to FREE to those who have
invested $1000 or 1000 hours into their business. We will determine the
validity of the request through an interview. (The entrepreneur must purchase our
sales book and workbook). This needs your financial support!
2. We will deliver Marketing training for ""low Cost"" to FREE to those who
qualify, just like those listed above. This takes time and needs your financial
support.
3. We will deliver Technology training on our solution. Honor
Services Office is a Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Invoicing and
Email Marketing tool that is designed to grow as your business grows. We made
this ""low cost"" to FREE to help small businesses get a solid start, but this needs to be
subsidized.
4. We developed low cost resources to help the Do-it-Yourself’ers.
Our Peaceful Selling curriculum helps teach new and existing entrepreneurs ways
to grow their business with “sales” techniques. Our Plans to Prosper curriculum
teaches marketing strategies that can be used to grow and expand the business.
Each comes with a book and workbook.
5. We offer services (not for free) to execute the marketing for
small businesses. We help the small business owners with executable marketing
to drive in sales. 
Our books, ""Plans to Prosper:Strategies, Systems and Tools for Small Business Marketing Success"" and ""Peaceful Selling: Easy Sales Techniques to Grow Your Small Business"" will be used as the initial curriculum. These can be found on Amazon.com and have received a 4.5 star rating by Small Business Trends. We will expand to other facets of the business in the future.




Our Impactful Plan that includes YOU 
On April 18th, we will start with our first event. “Ways to Empower

we cannot do this alone and need your help.


Risks & Challenges

We started the application for it in 2011, when we imported our pilot project Sitio Santa Rosa. As mentioned before we do not condone participating in corruption, therefore obtaining these licenses take much longer than they should.</p><p>The other one, which is local fabrication, removes the import problem altogether. On local fabrication we are negotiating with three parties, two techno parks and a university. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Your Contribution</h3><p>If you decide to contribute, but you cannot afford large amounts, know that that’s the idea of crowdfunding. Many times $11 gets the job done too. We have gotten this far with 74 people investing on average $75 a month. Imagine where we will get with 3.000 people doing that.</p><p>And if you are not in the position to contribute financially, but you do support the general idea, please spread the word around. Besides your own networks LinkedIn, facebook, googleplus, the Indiegogo platform provides tools to inform others about our project.</p><p>We thank you for taking the time to read, and hope to welcome you soon as one of our backers.</p><p></p></div>","PROJECT MOVED TO COMMUNITY: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/wifi-zone-caputera-brazil

We believe all of these stakeholders should have real influence on company policy. To get a better idea about our base rules on dividend and employee participation take a look at these links:On profits, dividend and general economics, billionaire mr. Nick Hanauer: http://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fe...On employee participation award winning Brazilian entrepreneur mr. Ricardo Semler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USC1RE8jE50  & http://www.npo.nl/tegenlicht/04-02-2013/VPWON_1... Your PerksIf you are still here it means we are now on the same page. You now understand why it is so hard for us to get funded. Crowdfunding by law does not allow us to offer you shares or other future financial gains, so we have invented some small amount perks that will give you the feeling that you are really helping out. Your support will not be forgotten. For major investors or businesses we have included perks based on our experience on setting up a business in Brasil.And for the adventurous type, we offer a type of internship in Brazil.
Your Impact
If you have watched the Semler and Hanauer talks, there is not much to add about the impact. We will be creating equal opportunities and continue to invest in them. The more people join this way of life, the less inequity will exist. I would like to leave you with the artist impression that our backer Lisa Cruysberg made about the impact, and about our continuous funding efforts.Risks & ChallengesOur Caputera project has a timetable for realization until December 2015. The main factor slowing us down is import delay. We have two initiatives going to improve on that. One is obtaining an unrestricted import license, called Radar/Siscomex. We started the application for it in 2011, when we imported our pilot project Sitio Santa Rosa. As mentioned before we do not condone participating in corruption, therefore obtaining these licenses take much longer than they should.The other one, which is local fabrication, removes the import problem altogether. On local fabrication we are negotiating with three parties, two techno parks and a university. Your ContributionIf you decide to contribute, but you cannot afford large amounts, know that that’s the idea of crowdfunding. Many times $11 gets the job done too. We have gotten this far with 74 people investing on average $75 a month. Imagine where we will get with 3.000 people doing that.And if you are not in the position to contribute financially, but you do support the general idea, please spread the word around. Besides your own networks LinkedIn, facebook, googleplus, the Indiegogo platform provides tools to inform others about our project.We thank you for taking the time to read, and hope to welcome you soon as one of our backers.",12.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h2>The AguaSAC Story</h2> <p>Hello... my name is<b> Liesl Harder Kielp </b>and I've been a Package Engineer for most of my career.  A few years ago, I designed the AguaSAC pouch to hold water and wanted to sell it to all the big beverage companies and make lots of money... imagine that!  After the package was designed and I began the testing process, I realized there were a lot of people with significant cognitive challenges who either had no quality opportunities for employment or very limited ones available.  Realizing the filling, labeling and distribution of the AguaSAC pouch was a perfect fit to employ this segment of our population, I set about creating the production systems necessary to make this crazy thought a reality... <b>an integrated production environment</b> where half the employees were mainstream and the other half had a significant cognitive challenge.</p>

<p>We started filling the pouches and hired <b>ValleyLife members</b> to apply the labels.  As demand grew, we hired Andrew to help deliver the pouches to our clients and just recently hired Pattie to take over the filling of the pouches with Andrew at our temporary production facility.  The good news, by ramping up production slowly and methodically, we've learned what's needed to fill this package in higher volumes AND more importantly, We've learned how to divide up the jobs so we can have an <b>employee rich production facility </b>where our associates never experience boredom from doing one task repetitiously yet they can still have duties that are organized and simple to perform.</p>

</div></div>","Take a m0mnt to change the world!


Each of us has a charitable cause we’re passionate about.  Whether we helped a family member fight through cancer, adopted our best friend from a nearby shelter, or met an inspirational survivor at a 5K last summer.  
But very few of us can afford to hand that cause large sums of money.  And we're all too busy to help bring more attention to the great work their doing.
m0mnt.org is about having a big impact for those causes!


Built to raise awareness for the causes you're passionate about
90% of our membership fees go to charity EVERY MONTH
Members hand a big check to the charity with the most votes EVERY MONTH
Nominate causes YOU care about
A fully awesome members only social network
10% goes to keeping m0mnt.org AD-FREE and Private/members only
Your info is NOT for sale
$5/month

Join m0mnt and become a catalyst for change!
   We're all in this together! We want to give a giant check to our first winning charity nominee in May!  This campaign is to raise funding for our first community charity donation. Join the movement and help us get m0mnt.org off the ground! Every dollar raised here will go to the first winning nomination on m0mnt.org. Even if we only get 20 bucks... it'll go straight to the winning charity.  If we happen to get a gagillion dollars, well guess what... that goes straight to the winning nomination.
This is all about showing the world what m0mnt.org is all about... and handing a charity a gagillion dollars is exactly what we're designed to do. 


   Its about making a huge Impact! By giving this campaign money you're taking action towards making our world a better place.  Imagine a world where we all thought about, talked about, and took action for charitable causes EVERY day.
Thats the world I want to raise my daughter in.  Thats the world we all deserve...and thats the world m0mnt.org is trying to create.
    Risks & Challenges We definitely have challenges. 
People are SO busy these days that its tough to get people to deviate from their routines long enough to join anything...let alone the m0mnt.org community... 
Another obstacle is the small percentage of people willing to make a 30 second video for a charity.  No matter how passionate for a specific cause, it can be scary to put oneself out there like that.  Members do not have to nominate anything, ever... but it is the life blood of what m0mnt.org is all about. 
But these obstacles are temporary.  In fact, over the next few months m0mnt.org will be growing faster and faster.  And the more members we have the bigger the donation checks, and the bigger the impact across the web as we raise awareness for the causes our members care about!


   Other Ways You Can Help There are 3 ways to help m0mnt.org:
1.  Join.  The more members the bigger the impact on charities and causes around the world EACH month!
2.  Spread the word.  Share this campaign...share a link to m0mnt...tweet about us...call your family...tell you mailman about us.  The more people talking about m0mnt.org the more positivity being spread around the globe.
3.  Tell a charity about us.  Tell them help is on the way.  Tell them that our members are working to get them the awareness and funding they need.",0.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div>
</div></div>","Bizzshout's MissionOur founder developed the innovation for Bizzshout! after recognizing how difficult it was to use social media to promote a personal or business brand to properly advance people and businesses. This promotional platform design will also serve as a solution to help millions of companies escape the ""pay-for-post-policy"" at Facebook Pages and other platforms, resulting in true organic reaches through promoted shouts.                 
With Bizzshout!, users can reach out to other people, businesses and students for two main purposes: 1. Growing unlimited social business connections to increase discovery, knowledge and resources: areas of expertise.2. Promoting their personal or business brand, products, services and creativity within the accessible social business culture. This enables users to advance awareness of their brand via targeted and active advocates. By participating in this process, you can inspire increased support, recognition and social commerce for future members in a business-casual environment from your Me Page.

   
Contributors Each contributor will be instrumental in helping launch the live phase of our distinct and unique platform from beta-testing. Our goal is to help transform the lives of students, people, entrepreneurs and businesses by enabling them to advance their personal branding, creativity, innovations and social commerce ambitions. The Bizzshout! platform will assist anyone who is passionate about promotional and discovery services, including our local, national and global neighbors. By joining us via this IndieGoGo campaign, you will be able to help yourself and other forward-thinking individuals who are looking for a better way to harness the structure and promotional power of social media to grow and earn!  
Summary


Bizzshout! has the potential to change the way business-minded individuals connect with each other for promotional purposes. Our platform has been designed to meet the unique needs of students, businesses and individuals who are interested in resourceful and effective promotional solutions at their Worldview Page.
Therefore, instead of risking intrusive self-promotion on Facebook to friends or breaking their Page policy with ""overly promotional"" posts, or paying for a Premium service on LinkedIn, Twitter's expensive ""Promote Products"" suite or promoted pins on Pintrest via cost-per-click basis, you will be able to turn to Bizzshout! to increase awareness of your personal or business brand with organic, trademarked shouts to advocates. 
The ultimate goal is to drive social business connections in a valuable way, identifying your areas of expertise to enable you to achieve the highest possible impact by sharing and receiving tips, advice and resources. This will be made possible by promoted features such as the bizzshout!, ishout! and online Creative Resumes as the first innovative services out of several in the pipeline. In the works...The Bizzshout! Spotlight offers stardom coverage, and our bizzmercial service complements the extension of TV advertising in digital marketing, where users can uniquely video shop. 

Each of these features has the power to improve awareness of your personal brand, product or special engagement. Here are two examples of how all of this works: 
1. Students, freelancers, consultants and job seekers can utilize the online Creative Resumes feature to attract the direct attention of hiring managers in our proprietary, shopping spree databases. 



2. Bizzshout! approvals will work in a manner that is similar to a like or retweet, but they are specifically geared toward driving enthusiasm and social commerce with classified advocates from promoted shouts; businesses post a bizzshout! on Company Pages and individuals post an ishout! on Promotional Pages.



             
             

Campaign Fund Achievements! 
Funding Goal: $30,000 allows a basic launch to make it possible for additional senior engineers to help buildout and maintain the platform with real competitive success, disrupting social media and advancing you! We have an AMAZING team of engineers that we would like to grow, so meeting the higher metric will give us the additional tools to create new jobs and launch with a bigger impact toward effective services in the pipeline.
Every penny donated will go toward our strategic needs and will provide us with the necessary resources to make the Bizzshout! desktop platform smooth and easy to use. We will also utilize our expanded team to build a mobile application and maintain necessities such as separate high-performance servers for user traffic and  video streaming.

<li><p>a portable commercial blind stitch machine for hemming garments</p></li>
<li><p>a coverstitch machine for sewing knits</p></li>
<li><p>an industrial form for developing and testing apparel patterns</p></li>
<li><p>production related materials &amp; supplies</p></li>
</ul><p>At some stage, we’ll outgrow our home studio.  Any additional funds we raise, will be set aside to help defray the cost of moving our workspace into a commercial space.  </p><p>What if we don’t make our goal?  We’re really committed to making this happen.  If we don’t make our goal, we’ll focus on purchasing the necessary inventory to make sure Flaming Needles progresses smoothly and investigate financing or leasing options for the additional equipment.</p><h1>The Impact</h1><p>Our project has the potential to impact a lot of people in positive ways.  Here are some of the people that can benefit and how they will benefit:</p><ul>
<li><p>Julian &amp; Neal - Obviously, we will directly benefit by being able to pursue a lifelong dream and channel our creativity into our work life.</p></li>
<li><p>New Sewing Enthusiasts - Sewing is a wonderful hobby that provides a lot of enjoyment and can also build marketable skills.  Many new sewers find creative ways to create additional income from their hobby.  Sewing can also be a relaxing and almost meditative hobby. We would also hope to attract new talent to our own endeavor.</p></li>
<li><p>Buyers of our apparel - As our business expands, purchasers of our apparel will be able to enjoy quality clothing manufactured in the US.</p></li>
<li><p>Our local economy - Small businesses contribute greatly to their local economies.  We’ll be paying taxes that support public schools and services and eventually we’ll need to hire additional employees that will benefit by being able to work in our industry.  As we move into manufacturing, we are committed to producing our line here in the United States.  </p></li>
<li><p>Our supporters - Our supporters will be able to support something that is really meaningful to us and get some nice perks along the way.  We hope that our supporters will continue as our best customers and enjoy participating in our growth.</p></li>
</ul><h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1><p>Starting a business has a lot of risks.  We might not find enough people interested in our monthly fabric club or we might not be able to compete with other online fabric shops.  While that’s certainly a possibility, we feel that we’ve carefully researched competitive prices and we have the ability to provide expert service and added value.  </p><p>We also believe that our users will appreciate the additional content and services that we can offer.  Sewing is enjoying a resurgence of popularity right now but many new seamsters are still intimidated by more difficult projects.  We believe we can overcome that through video tutorials, detailed blog posts, and relevant content through periodic email newsletters.  Our goal is to build a community around our products and services!</p><h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1><p>We recognize that not everyone can help financially.  You can still help out though in a number of important ways:</p><ul>

<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Together with the community we create investment projects that result in permanent jobs, sustainable food, water and energy, and resilient communities driven by quality of life, health, prosperity and connectivity.</p>
<p>We set up the projects with a unique approach.

<p></p>
<p>Imagine what could happen if we capture and combine the power of all networks that connect our society in nature, information, infrastructure, and communities? This is what Detroit Urban Regen does to reinvigorate the city.</p>
<p>Detroit Urban Regen's mission is to <b>regenerate the city of Detroit with a revolutionary approach</b>. A former powerhouse of the automotive industry, the city has suffered from deindustrialization, a massive loss of jobs, decline in population, increase in crime, and many related issues. Yet, Detroit is a city full of resources and opportunities. We see this value and have brought together more than 15 international partners that join forces to use the best of Detroit to make it rise again. </p>

<h2>Details: How It Works </h2>

<p>Detroit Urban Regen is a project that started by visionary Dutch and American experts in urban regeneration in 2012 from the <a href=""http://urbanrenaissance.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Urban Renaissance Foundation</a>. We use innovative urban development to resurrect an icon from the old economy. An icon that has suffered from industrial and social decay, and is yet a city full of resources and opportunities. Detroit Urban Regen reinstates the city as a hub in the new economy, through developing and starting a new economic value chain in Detroit.<br/></p>
<p>Detroit was built on the car industry, and their decline is interlinked. The new rise of Detroit requires a <b>new backbone of economic power and social connectivity</b>. This is more than a single project or company can do, and that’s why one-off projects fail. Instead, Detroit Urban Regen introduces a completely new value chain from resource production, processing, retail, consumption and recycling. This results in a range of projects, all linked and supporting each other, but each capable of operating independently.</p>

<div>
<p>To make this backbone last, we build it based on resources we get for free, forever: bio-based industries. Bio-based industries rely on natural elements such as plants, microorganisms and ecosystem services to produce high-quality products sustainably.</p>
<p>These proven innovations are flexible, profitable, take advantage of the unique properties of Detroit and its people, and generate jobs, revenue, education, knowledge and healthy products that are useful for Detroiters.</p>
<p><b>Detroit Urban Regen plays on the strengths of Detroit</b>, such as its image as a hard-working production and processing oriented culture, the availability of skilled and unskilled labour, and the low cost of land.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
The not-for-profit Urban Renaissance Foundation is raising $200,000 to execute the Kick-Off Phase of Detroit Urban Regen. This phase results in the creation of 4-6 revolutionary urban regeneration projects that draw $40-80 million USD of private investment for sustainable development into the Detroit area.


Together with the community we create investment projects that result in permanent jobs, sustainable food, water and energy, and resilient communities driven by quality of life, health, prosperity and connectivity.
We set up the projects with a unique approach. Each project is part of a value chain of linked bio-based projects and together form a new economic backbone for Detroit. After 2 years of careful analysis, we brought together over 15 international partners that have the expertise to make this happen and we now need your help to kickstart Detroit Urban Regen.

With the kickstart funds of $200.000 the 15 partners develop concept and business plans for the 4-6 projects with the local community, and hunt for private investors to fund the projects. If the Kick-Off Phase is successfully funded, between $40-80 million worth of private investments is drawn to Detroit.


""The Urban Renainssance Foundation and its partners together form a tight team to realize Detroit Urban Regen.""


Time for Change!


Imagine what could happen if we capture and combine the power of all networks that connect our society in nature, information, infrastructure, and communities? This is what Detroit Urban Regen does to reinvigorate the city.
Detroit Urban Regen's mission is to regenerate the city of Detroit with a revolutionary approach. A former powerhouse of the automotive industry, the city has suffered from deindustrialization, a massive loss of jobs, decline in population, increase in crime, and many related issues. Yet, Detroit is a city full of resources and opportunities. We see this value and have brought together more than 15 international partners that join forces to use the best of Detroit to make it rise again. 




We resurrect Detroit from the old economy by introducing a unique urban regeneration approach, proven to be succesful. With it, we build a brand new economic and social value chain using innovative bio-based industry, innovative urban and economic development. This results in permanent jobs, fresh and affordable local food and products, new shops, education programmes, and a safer and stronger community. (For details, see the bottom of this page.)
While Detroiters develop initiatives and take matters in their own hands, Detroit Urban Regen connects, accelerates, and adds to these hotspots of energy to boost Detroit’s future by its people, for its people!



Realizing Detroit Urban Regen
Now imagine the possibilities of applying such an approach to the city of Detroit. In the Kick-Off Phase, Detroit Urban Regen forms 4-6 initial projects in a new value chain that create a new backbone of the economy. In the second phase, these projects are developed together with the community. This is enabled by Detroit Urban Regen's 15 partners that bring international expertise in:


Sustainable water and waste management
Urban farming
Sustainable energy
Resilient urbanism
Circular resource management
New transport technologies
Resilient business models





Who We Are




Realizing a new golden age for Detroit with a brand new city regeneration strategy, and U.S. and European partners
Urban Renaissance Foundation is an alliance of 12 partner organizations that span the landscape of urban transformation, active in six countries. Together we transform cities and communities: ranging from converting single buildings to transformations on a regional level, to sustainable, flourishing and exciting communties.
Urban Renaissance is a hands-on organization, fusing top-down strategy with bottom-up activation, and applying innovative business models, smart design, natural solutions and community oriented processes. We work on our own initiative as well as on invitation to realize visible improvements to communities small and large, in a short period of time.



What We Need & What You Get
The total Detroit Urban Regen funding required is $200,000 in order to finance the Kick-Off Phase. In this phase the locations fort he projects are found and investigated, community projects linked and partners attracted. It combines these into investment-ready projects and attract investment funding of $10-20 million USD per project, totalling $40-80 million USD capital flowing into Detroit.


A total of $35-50,000 per project will be invested simultaneously.

All investors receive a personal invitation to the Detroit Urban Regen Kick-Off Event where the projects are presented to private investors and strategic partners.


Investors above $1,000 receive a Surprise Gift Package from Holland.If we do not reach our entire goal, we still proceed with the Kick-Off Phase, but with less projects.

Significant Impact for Detroit and Detroiters



The funds enable Detroit Urban Regen, and with it a new future for a flourishing Detroit and its people.
A total of 4-6 projects will be sourced, outlined, investigated and made investment-ready through the creation of business plans. These projects combined help create the new economic backbone of Detroit.

Drawing investments to the city: the 4-6 projects will draw $40-60 million worth of private investments to Detroit.


Private Investor Road Shows will be organised as soon as the kick-off phase is completed.


Augmenting the auto industry as a primary job creator.

Providing fresh produce for the city.
Improving safety, education and welfare for the Detroit community.
Utilizing existing, underused infrastructure in the city.




Risks & Challenges

Challenge: Detroit Urban Regen is a unique approach. The tight and efficient management of a multi-disciplinary team of experts during the kick-off phase is a difficult task. How we are dealing with this: We have over 15 years of experience in multi-disciplanary development projects, including large-scale urban regeneration, around the world. This makes us confident we can make this a reality for Detroit as well.

Challenge: Sourcing and connecting suitable local and international partners. How we are dealing with this: We currently have 15 international partners capable of executing urban regeneration. During the kick-off phase we spend significant effort to find and engage additional partnersWe have reserved resources in the kick-off phase budget to source 8-12 additional local partners to execute and take ownership of the Detroit Urban Regen projects.

We started MicromistNOW to create inhalable products that would improve people's everyday lives.  Our first product is the QuickNIC Nicotine Inhaler.

The ProblemLife for the 1 billion smokers and vapers worldwide is becoming more difficult. Regulations, restrictions and social pressures make getting through the day pretty challenging.Whether it is enduring a long movie, finding time to take a break at work, airplanes, eating at restaurants, hanging out with non-smoker friends and family, or even driving with the kids.The SolutionQuickNIC allows smokers and vapers to quickly and discreetly satisfy nicotine cravings, anytime, anywhere without toxic chemicals, combustion or batteries.QuickNIC is a small, portable inhaler that delivers a fine mist of nicotine that is quickly absorbed through the lungs into the blood stream within 30 seconds.  Each breath delivers .33 mg of nicotine or about the same nicotine as one-third of a cigarette. QuickNIC comes in 2 different flavors, Cinnamon and Menthol and each inhaler contains about 90 breaths.The TeamThe QuickNIC team is an experienced group of entrepreneurs that met in business school 15 years ago. Dr. Kevin Shurtleff is the CEO and lead scientist.  In addition to being a chemistry professor, he also has an MBA.As a team we invested our own money to develop, test and submit patents for the products.  We purchased manufacturing equipment and created working prototypes that were used by smokers and vapers to provide valuable feedback.  How can you help?We need pre-orders of QuickNIC for two reasons…

<p>In 2008, I started my Health Journey and proceeded to lose over 150 pounds and transform my health
and my life. From this success I started my Health Coaching business bringing Nutritional Education,
Coaching and Support to the community. The business truly started to thrive with clients and developed
to a point where we needed a location. In Summer of 2010 a couple of partners, along with myself
opened “Nutrition 101” in Tempe, AZ. This location exploded and grew to a point where I proceeded to
open my own location, “Platinum Nutrition” in June 2011 on 5th Ave in Old Town Scottsdale, AZ.
Platinum Nutrition grew fast and became well known in the community and served thousands of local
residents. During this time, fitness became an additional focus for us as we worked to create a well
rounded approach for people to become and stay healthy. We ran a variety of fitness classes such as
Bootcamps, Yoga, Stretching, Workout Dance and more out of our location. Additionally, we developed
classes in a couple of the local parks in the Valley to expand our reach. In May of 2014 I found myself
drastically outgrowing our location because it was a very difficult location for fitness due to shape &amp; size.
At the same time the building was being upgraded, as well, and there was a significant rent increase. Due
to all of these circumstances it no longer made sense for us to be in this location and I made the choice
to close that location and search for a better one. In the meantime, I decided to work from my home
office running the health coaching portion of the business, as well as running our workouts in the parks.
This allowed me to really dial-in with my clients getting them results and take my time in finding the right
location that will be perfect for our Fitness, Nutrition &amp; Coaching all in a single location, as well as take
some extra time to spend with my family. I’ve been very fortunate to be able to impact the community
and I sincerely look to take my business, and impact on the Valley to even further heights in your location. </p>

<p><b>We will continue to feature more events on Go On Go Out than other event guides and to be the best place to find out what's going on.</b></p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p></p>
<p><span>Back in 2012 we had a p</span><span>roblem. We really struggled to find out what was going on in Portsmouth. We love <a href=""https://goongoout.com/uk/hampshire/portsmouth/events/live-music/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live music</a>, <a href=""https://goongoout.com/uk/hampshire/portsmouth/events/clubbing-djs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clubbing</a>, <a href=""https://goongoout.com/uk/hampshire/portsmouth/events/comedy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comedy</a>, <a href=""https://goongoout.com/uk/hampshire/portsmouth/events/theatre-shows/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theatre</a> and <a href=""https://goongoout.com/uk/hampshire/portsmouth/events/all/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">so much more</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Finding out what was happening involved hunting around on Facebook, liking all the venue pages, then having to Google as well to find those that didn’t use Facebook. Clicking on other event sites and thinking in a city of 200,000 there must be more than a couple of gigs on a Saturday night! </span></p>
<p><span>It was a massive pain in the arse and put us off looking for new things to do, but it gave us an idea…</span></p>
<p><span><b>What if there was one place that listed everything going on?</b></span></p>
<p>To cut a long story short we built Go On Go Out! Pulling event information from Facebook, ticket sites and other places to give a complete guide to everything going on.  </p>
<p>(If you want the long version of our story, keep an eye on <a href=""https://goongoout.com/more/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our blog</a> over the next few weeks.)</p>

<h2>Use of Funds</h2>
<p>The funds raised here will allow us to continue running Portsmouth's largest events site and also launch in Southampton ahead of rolling out across the UK and then other countries. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Without getting too technical we need to optimise our database and improve some of the systems before we can expand, your contributions will allow us to do this. (Happy to give more technical details if you want, feel free to ask any questions.)</p>
<p>We also need to invest in marketing and advertising for our Southampton launch.</p>

<p>Here’s the approximate timeline of how we will further develop Go On Go Out and when rewards will be available.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>August 2015 - Indiegogo campaign closes</li>
<li>September 2015 - Launch in Southampton</li>
<li>October 2015 - Equity crowdfunding round closes</li>
<li>January 2016 - Launch UK Wide. Credit can be spent on advertising and event promotion.</li>
<li>March-April 2016 - Launch ticketing solution. Credit can be spent on tickets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>You contribution will make a massive difference. It will allow us to carry on providing event-goers in Portsmouth with a complete guide to what's on and also expand to cover Southampton.</p>
<p>The funds raised here will allow us to launch a larger campaign later in the year which will allow us to apply our platform across the whole of the UK and then further afield.</p>
<p><b>We will give everyone complete and accurate information about what's going on where they are.</b></p>
<p>By increasing awareness of what's going on, we can help the small venues, promoters and artists. In Portsmouth we are often the only event guide listing many of the smaller gigs, club nights and other events. If we can help get more people going to these events, it will play a part in reducing the rate at which pubs and other entertainment venues are closing. </p>

<h2>Risks</h2>
<div>Although we have the platform developed and have proven that it works there are of course still risks. The risks might be less than projects at earlier stages but you should still be aware of them before backing us. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">The UK roll out depends on another crowdfunding campaign, what if that isn't successful?</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> We have been working with the UK government's Growth Accelerator programme and are talking to angel investors as well as working directly with an equity crowdfunding site to develop a strong campaign.

However, if is unsuccessful we will continue to provide the largest guide to events in Portsmouth (and soon Southampton), the UK roll out may be delayed slightly but will still happen in 2016.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>What if no one wants to sell tickets with us? </b>We can't say too much here but are very confident the ticketing solution we are developing will be used, we will be offering something easier and cheaper than existing options that will work either as the main ticket outlet, or alongside the solutions venues and artists already use to generate additional sales. We'll be engaging in a large consultation process to make sure we get it right and we'll want your views, watch out for an email.  </li>
<li>
<b>What if we don't meet our goal?</b> We opted for flexible funding as we can achieve our aims without meeting our goal. The most likely impact will be less marketing activity for the Southampton launch, resulting in slower growth. We may also have to postpone some of the less urgent development work needed. Overall we could see slight delays to expected timescales but we will continue and rewards will be fulfilled. </li>

</div></div>","Go On Go Out
So much more than just another events site. Go On Go Out grabs events from all over the web and presents them in an easy to use way, giving you a complete guide to everything going on. Go On Go Out is completely free to use and completely free for venues and promoters to list their events. We will never charge for event listings.
This is not just another pie in the sky idea, we are live and running and have been providing the largest guide to events in Portsmouth for the last year. Go on, check it out! 
We have developed a platform that can be applied to any location in the world, with responsive design that works well on any device. We have up to 10x more events than other event guides (and sometimes more!), over 10,000 events and 3,000 artists in our system. We rank in the top 3 on Google for many terms and receive over 13,000 visitors a month. We now need your help to keep going and keep growing.



It looks better live! Please take a look.
What's Next?
What we have now is just the start. We will be launching in Southampton soon, then over the next 6 months we will be making improvements to how we gather, store and present information ahead of launching UK-wide (with other countries following soon after). We'll be increasing Facebook and other social media integration with an intelligent event suggestion system to make it even easier for you to discover new events.  We will also be developing mobile apps with location based features and some exciting things that was can't really talk about yet. :)
We will continue to feature more events on Go On Go Out than other event guides and to be the best place to find out what's going on.
We'll also be developing on the ticketing system we are currently trialling. Consulting with venues, promoters, artists and event-goers to offer something that solves the problems with existing ticketing solutions.
This campaign is ahead of a larger equity crowdfunding round in September/October. We'll keep it fairly brief here, but if you are interested in investing, or would like to see our financial projections, business plan or other documents or if you have any questions at all please get in touch, hello@goongoout.com.


Who Are We?


Go On Go Out Founders: Si Bunting (me) and Ruth Eades. 
The Go On Go Out team is made up of the founders, Ruth Eades and Si Bunting along with Tom Mayhead.
Check out our profiles above for more about us!
All of us have been around events since we were children. My Dad has promoted live music events for 20 years and used to run a pub, Ruth’s brother is a DJ and producer. Many of our closest friends run venues, promote events or are DJs or musicians. 
We all love going out and are passionate about what we have built with Go On Go Out. We've found some amazing and unusual events along the way as well! We can't wait to build on this to reach more people and develop even better ways to help everyone find out what's going on. If you'd like to know any more about us, please ask away! 

Tom, Ruth & Si. The Go On Go Out team.


Our Story

Back in 2012 we had a problem. We really struggled to find out what was going on in Portsmouth. We love live music, clubbing, comedy, theatre and so much more. 
Finding out what was happening involved hunting around on Facebook, liking all the venue pages, then having to Google as well to find those that didn’t use Facebook. Clicking on other event sites and thinking in a city of 200,000 there must be more than a couple of gigs on a Saturday night! 
It was a massive pain in the arse and put us off looking for new things to do, but it gave us an idea…
What if there was one place that listed everything going on?
To cut a long story short we built Go On Go Out! Pulling event information from Facebook, ticket sites and other places to give a complete guide to everything going on.  
(If you want the long version of our story, keep an eye on our blog over the next few weeks.)
Please check out the kind things people are saying about us.

Timeline




Here’s the approximate timeline of how we will further develop Go On Go Out and when rewards will be available.


August 2015 - Indiegogo campaign closes
September 2015 - Launch in Southampton
October 2015 - Equity crowdfunding round closes
January 2016 - Launch UK Wide. Credit can be spent on advertising and event promotion.
March-April 2016 - Launch ticketing solution. Credit can be spent on tickets.

Risks
Although we have the platform developed and have proven that it works there are of course still risks. The risks might be less than projects at earlier stages but you should still be aware of them before backing us. 



The UK roll out depends on another crowdfunding campaign, what if that isn't successful? We have been working with the UK government's Growth Accelerator programme and are talking to angel investors as well as working directly with an equity crowdfunding site to develop a strong campaign. We are SEIS eligible and have an attractive valuation so are confident this will succeed. However, if is unsuccessful we will continue to provide the largest guide to events in Portsmouth (and soon Southampton), the UK roll out may be delayed slightly but will still happen in 2016.
